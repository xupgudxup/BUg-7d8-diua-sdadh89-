It was an exercise in why sanctioned sport is healthy for the world, as both sides were able to express their dissatisfaction by hurling fists at each other.\n\nIt was a moment that set the sports world on fire.\n\nThe Canadiens got the last swing and landed the knockout blow by winning the Four Nations tournament in an American barn.

    "description": "CeeDee Lamb feels comfortable advocating for what he wants to see from the Cowboys",
    "fullText": "CeeDee Lamb has gotten the question a lot this week. The George Pickens contract situation is on the top of everybody’s minds when it comes to matters concerning the Dallas Cowboys, and given that Lamb is close with Pickens, it makes sense for him to address it.\n\nWhen it comes to situations like these some players offer a party line. They note that the business of football is what it is and that they trust their front office to take care of what is in the best interest of the team. Lamb has hardly stepped a toe out of line on the Pickens front, but he has not been shy. He wants Pickens back and even said he would be fine if Pickens out-earns him on a hypothetical new deal.\n\nThose who have followed Lamb, whether at Oklahoma or in the six seasons that he has been in Dallas, know that he is hardly boisterous. He is not brash. He is hardly stirring the pot with his Pickens comments, but his advocacy is a further step out than we have seen him take normally (he certainly campaigned for Micah Parsons and Dak Prescott to get compensated when they were dealing with the team).\n\nLamb made an appearance on Saturday at Super Bowl LX to discuss how he treated an Air Force veteran to a trip to see the game of all games and I asked him when he felt comfortable speaking up about things he wants to see the team do.\n\nDallas Cowboys WR CeeDee Lamb has been outspoken about wanting George Pickens back this offseason. \n\nI was curious when he felt confident enough to vocalize his wants about decisions like that with respect to the team and front office at large. pic.twitter.com/rGXzHxIfTq\n\n— RJ Ochoa (@rjochoa) February 7, 2026\n\nLamb noted that he has always had the availability to advocate in this sense so that particular part of things is nothing new, but he did add that he feels comfortable in his space.\n\nIt has been interesting in the time that the Cowboys have developed their approach to contract extensions to see how player advocacy has evolved with that. To start this week Dak Prescott also noted that he would “get involved” if he had to in the Pickens situation. Nobody wants to read too much into any one comment from any player, but they appear to be utilizing their own platforms to state their wants and wishes. It is interesting to see.",

    "fullText": "No one was expecting year one of the Ben Johnson era to end in a Super Bowl for the Chicago Bears, but the 2025 season went better than most fans could have expected. But even so, it felt like it ended too soon. The loss in the NFC Divisional Round against the Los Angeles Rams stung because they had worked their magic again, battling back to tie the game with just 19 seconds left.\n\nA Rams three-and-out to start the overtime period, and the Bears were in position to win.\n\nThe end was disappointing, but the season truly felt like the start of something special, and 89% of of fans feel the Super Bowl window is open.\n\nBen Johnson changed the trajectory of the franchise.\n\nHis partnership with Caleb Williams had a rough start, by design, and it got better and better as the year wore on.\n\nChicago finished ninth in points scored and sixth in total offensive yards. The Bears’ top-ten finish in those two categories has occurred only three other times since 1985.\n\nIncluding his three years as offensive coordinator in Detroit, Johnson’s offense has never been out of the top ten in either of those two categories.\n\nThe arrow is pointing up on the offense, and if the Bears attack the defense this offseason as they attacked the offense last year, that side of the ball will more than hold its own in 2026.\n\nOur partners at FanDuel Sportsbook have the Bears odds to win next year’s Super Bowl at +2700.\n\nThe window may be open, but Johnson won’t take it for granted.\n\n“There is no building off of this,” Johnson said at the end of the season press conference. “We go back to square one. We’re back at the bottom again.”\n\nThis is SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across the NFL. Throughout the year, we’ll ask questions of the most plugged-in Chicago Bears fans and fans across the country.",

The Biancocelesti were dominating but Bari scored in the 9th minute. Kennet Andersson headed the ball to Carmine Gautieri who beat the Lazio defence for speed and was supposedly fouled by Luca Marchegiani in the penalty box. Supposedly, because there were big doubts. But the referee, Daniele Tombolini, decided it was a penalty and Igor Protti made no mistake.\n\nThe ref must have thought he had made a wrong call because he then opted to compensate with a ridiculous decision: in the 22nd minute Francesco Pedone touched Alen Boksic who went flying to the ground. Penalty for Lazio, Beppe Signori scored. 1-1 but two wrongs certainly do not make a right, Mr. Tombolini.\n\nFour minutes later penalty number three. This time it was a clear foul with Marcello Montanari tripping Aron Winter. Signori made it 2-1.\n\nLazio took control of the match and Boksic was unstoppable. The Croatian had a chance in the 30th minute but it was saved by Fontana. The ball got to Winter who passed it to Signori. 3-1 for Lazio. With these three goals Signori overtook Giorgio Chinaglia and became Lazio’s second highest scorer in Serie A, behind Silvio Piola.\n\nIn the second half Bari manager Eugenio Fascetti realized that there was a need to speed things up a bit and make more use of Andersson and this is exactly what happened in the 64th minute. Gautieri had no problem in beating Dario Marcolin on the right and crossed for the big Swede. The ball went over Marchegiani’s head and Andersson headed the ball in comfortably.\n\nAt the one end, there was Gautieri unstoppable on the right while Protti was driving Alessandro Nesta nuts and all the crosses were Andersson’s. At the other end Boksic, Casiraghi and Signori were creating havoc in the Bari penalty box.\n\nAndersson had a chance via a free kick but it was well saved by the Lazio goalkeeper. Boksic dribbled past a number of Bari players and passed to Casiraghi who hit the woodwork. In the 78th minute the Croatian decided to go solo and made it 4-2 for Lazio.\n\nTombolini, who was a bit upset that he was no longer the protagonist of the match, decided it was time for another penalty. So in the 81st minute Protti scored his second goal. No idea on why the ref decided it was a penalty.\n\nThe referee’s masterpiece however came with one minute to go. Casiraghi, unmarked, thirty metres from the goal with the Bari goalkeeper outside the penalty box, decided to shoot. Fontana clearly saved it with his hands. The referee whistled. Foul. Everybody was expecting a red card but Fontana claimed the ball hit his leg, Casiraghi confirmed it, so the ref decided on a dropped-ball.\n\nLazio managed to keep the slim lead and win a very difficult match. Tombolini should have seriously considered giving up refereeing.\n\nToday we remember the tragic death of Octavio Fantoni II.\n\nHe was born in Belo Horizonte, on April 4, 1907. In Brazil he played for Palestra Itália (the club now owned by Ronaldo). He won two Mineiro titles with “A Raposa” (The Fox) and in 1930 he was signed by Lazio along with one of his cousins, Joāo Fantoni I. He became known as Ottavio.\n\nIn Rome he immediately made it into the first team squad. In 1930-31 the manager was first Ferenc Molnár, then Cesare Migliorini and finally Amílcar. Lazio finished 8th and Ottavio played 10 league games. Lazio’s best results were beating Ambrosiana Inter 1-0 and Juventus 2-1 both at home while both derbies ended up in draws.\n\nIn 1931-32 Lazio finished 13th under player-manager Amílcar. Ottavio played more regularly making 28 league appearances with 2 goals (Triestina and the winner against Fiorentina). Lazio’s best result was a 2-1 away win at Juventus while both derbies were lost.\n\nIn 1932-33 the manager was Austrian Karl Stürmer and Lazio finished 10th. Ottavio played 26 league games with 1 goal (Pro Patria). He was also joined by another of the cousins, Leonízio Fantoni III. Lazio’s best results were beating Inter 2-1 in Milan, the first derby 2-1, Alessandria 6-0, Juventus 1-0 and Milan 2-0 all at home.\n\nIn 1933-34 Stürmer stayed on and Lazio came in 10th again. Ottavio Played 31 league games with 1 goal (Casale in 2-1 win). The highlight was a 4-0 home win over Milan while Lazio lost the first derby and drew the second 3-3 after being 0-3 down.\n\nIn 1934-35 Czech manager Walter Alt arrived at Lazio. A certain Silvio Piola also arrived from Pro Vercelli. It would however be a tragic year for Lazio and Ottavio Fantoni in particular. On January 20, in a home game against Torino, he wounded his nose. He was forced off but came back on five minutes later and even contributed to Silvio Piola’s equaliser. It did not seem anything too serious but then it got infected and he was hospitalised with a high fever and a knee full of pus; two weeks later he was dead. An awful tragedy. He was only 27 and left two daughters of eight and seven who had already lost their mother.\n\nIn his last tragic season Ottavio had played 13 league games with 1 goal (Fiorentina). Lazio finished a positive 5th beating Juventus 5-3 and drawing both derbies.\n\nFantoni’s premature death is one of many sad stories in Lazio’s history.\n\nOttavio Fantoni also played for Italy, thanks to his Tuscan origins (his parents were from Arezzo). He won one cap against Greece, on March 24,1934, in a 4-0 victory.\n\nThe Fantoni legacy is an important one at Lazio. Ottavio played 109 games with 4 goals, Joāo 113 with 38 goals, Leonízio 25 with 9 goals and some years later Orlando 8 with 2 goals.\n\nOttavio Fantoni was an extremely popular player at Lazio. He was a midfielder who combined quantity and quality. He was elegant, technical but also incredibly hard working. The fans loved him for his fighting spirit.\n\nIn Brazil he was known as Nininho while in Italy as mentioned he became Ottavio. He was known as Fantoni II because he had three cousins who were also footballers.\n\nElseid Hysaj, 2/2/1994, defender, Albania, 130 appearances, 2 goals (2021-ongoing)\n\nRavel Morrison, 2/2/1993, midfielder, UK, 8 appearances (2015-16)\n\nGiuseppe Papadopulo, 2/2/1948, defender, Italy, 90 appearances (1969-72, manager 2005)\n\nGuglielmo Stendardo, 2/2/1981, defender, Italy, 104 appearances, 7 goals (2005-11)\n\nGiuseppe Corti, 3/2/1957, midfielder, Italy, 22 appearances, 1 goal (1985-86)\n\nDino Sbrana II, 3/2/1907, forward, Italy, 15 appearances, 1 goal (1929-30)\n\nHumberto Tozzi, 4/2/1934, forward, Brazil, 103 appearances, 45 goals (1956-60)\n\nStefan de Vrij, 5/2/1992, defender, Netherlands, 118 appearances, 10 goals (2014-18)\n\nVincenzo Esposito, 5/2/1963, midfielder, Italy, 57 appearances (1986-88)\n\nGiancarlo Morrone, 5/2/1941, forward/midfielder, Argentina, 269 appearances, 53 goals (1960-64, 1966-71, manager 1984)\n\nFisayo Dele-Bashiru, 6/2/2001, midfielder, Nigeria, 41 appearances, 5 goals (2024-ongoing)\n\nDario Pighin, 6/2/1951, defender, Italy, 106 appearances (1976-82)\n\nValon Berisha, 7/2/1993, midfielder, Norway, 22 appearances (2018-20)\n\nFederico Marchetti, 7/2/1983, goalkeeper, Italy, 194 appearances (2011-18)\n\nOusmane Dabo, 8/2/1977, midfielder, France, 155 appearances, 4 goals (2003-06, 2008-10)\n\nMassimo De Stefanis, 8/2/1957, midfielder, 8 appearances, 1 goal (1977-79)\n\nThis Article Was Written by Dag Jenkins & Simon Basten from Lazio Stories.

    "fullText": "Tom Brady once found himself puzzled by a debate that resurfaced well beyond the football field.\n\nIn July 2025, the seven-time Super Bowl champion addressed comments made by golf star Scottie Scheffler about family and professional priorities, offering a perspective shaped by his own career.\n\nBrady shared his reaction in a personal reflection published on TomBrady.com, responding to the idea that being an elite athlete and a devoted family man sit in opposition.\n\nHe said, “Scottie said he’d rather be a better father and husband than a good golfer. And my question is: why are those mutually exclusive? Sure, they’re different blocks on the pyramid, but they’re part of the same pyramid.\n\n“They’re connected! For instance, I think part of being a great father is being a great example of doing what it takes to take care of your family. I chose to do it by playing football,” Brady added.\n\nAt the time, Brady’s comments stood out because they challenged a growing narrative around elite sport and sacrifice.\n\nRather than rejecting family-first values, Brady reframed the discussion. In his view, professional excellence and personal responsibility are intertwined rather than competing priorities.\n\nThe tone of the response reflected where Brady was in life then, nearing the end of his playing career and increasingly reflective about his legacy.\n\nBrady expanded on his thinking by explaining how his relentless commitment to football fit into his definition of being present for his family.\n\n“My dedication to the sport, the hours of practice, the moments when I was laser focused, those were times when I believe I was doing the best possible thing for my family and my kids.\n\n“By prioritizing my profession and teaching, by example, what it takes to be really good at your job, what it takes to follow through on commitments, what it takes to be a great teammate; and showing them, also by example, that work is a big part of all of our lives,” Brady added.\n\nThe comments offered insight into how Brady justified the demands of a two-decade career.\n\nHe viewed discipline, preparation, and consistency not as absences from family life, but as lessons delivered through action.\n\nLooking back, the exchange captured a philosophical divide rather than a disagreement. Both perspectives valued family, but differed on how professional ambition fits into that picture.\n\nAs a throwback moment, Brady’s response now reads as a snapshot of an athlete grappling with balance while still defending the path he chose.\n\nIt remains a reminder that conversations about success and family are rarely simple, even among the most accomplished figures in sport.\n\nTom Brady reveals he once took his 11-year-old son to a Super Bowl party hosted by Snoop Dogg\n\nDrake Maye has chance to match Tom Brady record, this could be his reason not to support Patriots\n\nFuture #1 overall pick Fernando Mendoza explains why he grew up idolizing Tom Brady",

    "fullText": "The New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl for the first time since 2018, when three-time AP NFL MVP quarterback Tom Brady led them to a victory at Super Bowl LIII.\n\nThe Patriots are led by a new quarterback this season — AP NFL MVP finalist Drake Maye. Nevertheless, Brady’s lasting impact with the team over the course of his 20-year career in New England has consistently been brought to remembrance ahead of the Super Bowl on February 8.\n\nA win for Maye at Super Bowl LX will make him the second starting quarterback aside from Brady to win a championship for New England, which would draw comparisons to the former franchise great.\n\nLet’s take a look at Brady’s history in Super Bowl appearances:\n\nTom Brady is a seven-time Super Bowl champion.\n\nBrady won the Super Bowl six times (2001, 2003-04, ‘14, ‘16, ‘18) for the New England Patriots. The Michigan product won his seventh Super Bowl for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020 — his first season with the franchise.\n\nBrady owns a 7-3 record across 10 Super Bowl appearances.\n\nThe three-time first-team All-Pro quarterback's three losses in the big game came against the New York Giants (2007, ‘11), followed by the Philadelphia Eagles (2017).\n\nBrady won the Super Bowl MVP five times in his career. He won four times with New England (2001, ‘03, ‘14, ‘16), as well as with Tampa Bay (2020) once.\n\nFollow Patriots Wire on Twitter and Facebook.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Patriots Wire: How many Super Bowl rings does Tom Brady have?",

Bayern get their fourth goal from Luis Diaz’s second, after he ghosts in between the Hoffenheim players and connects with Michael Olise’s pass.\n\n57’ — Neuer saves from point-blank range, and Jonathan Tah has been booked for a foul in the build up.\n\n51’ — Harry Kane’s header has been tipped over by Oliver Baumann\n\nBayern still playing a bit sloppy. Kompany won’t have enough time to sort the squad out come the Champions League knockouts.\n\nManuel Neuer…what can I say? It’s Jonas Urbig time.\n\nKramaric is Kramaric, nothing new.\n\n45+1’ — TOR! Harry Kane sets Bayern off on the counter and finds Luis Diaz who calmly finesses the ball into the goal past a stationary Oliver Baumann.\n\n45’ — TOR! Harry Kane scores another penalty. We take those.\n\n44’ — PENALTY TO BAYERN! Vladimir Coufal is booked for the foul.\n\n41’ — Bayern still knocking on the door but nothing to show for it.\n\n36’ — Goal. Manuel Neuer chips the ball straight to Andrej Kramaric inside Bayern’s box and he duly finishes the shot.\n\n32’ — Serge Gnabry fires it well wide.

With Borussia Dortmund closing the gap, the Bavarians must win this match against Hoffenheim. It won’t be easy as Die Kraichgauer are third in the league and have the second-best attack behind Bayern.\n\nBayern reportedly has a fully fit squad which will come as welcome news to Vincent Kompany who cannot afford to have his team lose a bit of control, especially during the part of the season where seasons are normally decided.\n\nLocation: Allianz Arena, Munich, Germany\n\nTime: 5:30 PM Local time | 11:30 AM EST | 8:30 AM PST\n\nTV/streaming: ESPN+, Find Your Country\n\nBayern wins 4-2 with goals from Harry Kane (x2), Michael Olise, and Serge Gnabry off the bench. Andrej Kramarić scores twice because he’s that kind of player.\n\nWhile waiting for the match, do consider listening to the latest episode of Bavarian Podcast Works (more on that below) or you may read the selected reads below:\n\nIf you’re a new member, feel free to introduce yourself!

    "description": "We continue the series with a longtime editor, Kevin Adams.",
    "fullText": "As part of the fun surrounding our 50th anniversary, Golfweek has been walking down Memory Lane with a number of former employees who helped make the brand what it is today.\n\nWe continue the series with a longtime editor, Kevin Adams.\n\nSenior Marketing Editorial Manager, Holland & Knight LLP\n\nI was more on the editing side, so I didn't get to write too often at Golfweek, but I was most proud of some of my travel writing, including features that I wrote on a Hawaii golf cruise, Pinehurst, Daufuskie Island, Hilton Head and a spring training-golf combo trip in South Florida. Travel editors Jeff Barr and Marty Kaufmann graciously afforded me the opportunity to go on such trips, and I still feel those were some of the best articles in my sports journalism career of nearly 25 years.\n\nEvery Sunday night and Monday during a major week, which was a blur from the end of Sunday's final round until the magazine was completed the evening after. We'd always have a ton of extra pages to fill, with very little copy coming in before late Sunday evening. We typically left at midnight or after, then were back at 8 a.m. on Monday morning to start editing the stories turned in overnight and then reviewing each page as it was completed, often not leaving the office until the last page was done at 8 or 9 p.m. (or later). Looking back, I'm not sure how we did it, but having a terrific team of writers that knew the game inside and out and didn't need a ton of edits certainly helped.\n\nHarbour Town Golf Links, hands down. I was the sports editor at the Hilton Head Island Packet newspaper for 7 years or so in the 1990s, and got to cover the Heritage PGA Tour event each April and play Harbour Town a couple of times per year. I consider it Pete Dye's best work, and it's a tribute to his mastery that such a short course still challenges and confounds the world's best players, not to mention the Heritage's list of champions reads like a wall straight from the Golf Hall of Fame. One of the best sets of par 3s anywhere, and there's still nothing like standing on the 18th tee with the wind whipping, Calibogue Sound to your left and the iconic lighthouse straight ahead.\n\n(Editor's note: We appreciate all the former employees who have contributed time and effort to this feature. The golf journalism community is a small one and we're proud of the achievements of all our former colleagues.)\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Golfweek 50th anniversary memories: Longtime editor Kevin Adams",

    "fullText": "For the first time in four years, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander won't participate at NBA All-Star weekend. Once he was ruled out through the break with an abdominal strain, the reigning MVP's absence let out some air from the balloon in a three-day event that highlights the league's best players.\n\nAlperen Sengun has replaced Gilgeous-Alexander as a 2026 NBA All-Star injury replacement. He will take his spot on Team World in the three-team round-robin tournament that replaces Sunday's traditional All-Star Game.\n\nSengun's NBA All-Star teammates are Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Luka Doncic, Victor Wembanyama, Karl-Anthony Towns, Jamal Murray, Deni Avdija and Pascal Siakam.\n\nSengun joins teammate Kevin Durant for the star-studded event. Both will represent the Houston Rockets. Just yesterday, the hospital Oklahoma City Thunder dropped a 112-106 loss to them. Sengun had a 17-point, 12-rebound and 11-assist triple-double.\n\nThe Thunder continue to voyage through Gilgeous-Alexander's absence. So far, they're 0-2 in a five-game stretch. Never ideal to be without your best player, but sacrificing five games for three weeks off is pretty economical.\n\nThe Thunder will still be part of the NBA All-Star weekend extravaganza. Chet Holmgren will be part of Team USA stars. His teammates are Anthony Edwards, Cade Cunningham, Devin Booker, Tyrese Maxey, Scottie Barnes, Jalen Johnson and Jalen Duren.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander's 2026 NBA All-Star replacement revealed",

    "fullText": "COLUMBIA — More injury news popped up for South Carolina women's basketball, this time right before tipoff in a top-20 matchup.\n\nSophomore point guard Maddy McDaniel was listed as out on the SEC injury report ahead of the game against No. 17 Tennessee at 3 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nMcDaniel wasn't one of the three guards previously injured this week, as coach Dawn Staley had been dealing with limitations for Ta'Niya Latson, Agot Makeer and Tessa Johnson.\n\nOnly Makeer was listed as out for the No. 3 Gamecocks (23-2, 9-1 SEC) on the injury report published on Feb. 7, a positive sign with Johnson and Latson back but now Staley is down yet another guard.\n\nAgainst a team like the Lady Vols (15-5, 7-1), guard play matters as they press a lot with a fast-paced tempo which means Raven Johnson will need help handling the ball.\n\nThe sophomore's minutes have increased as Staley hasn't had two of her three starting guards the last two full games.\n\nMcDaniel is averaging 4.5 points and three assists per game and has had a combined 17 points and nine assists over the last two.\n\nBefore Makeer went down in the first quarter of the win over Auburn on Jan. 29, she was starting in place of center Madina Okot.\n\nInjuries are nothing new for this year's team, dating back to when star forward Chloe Kitts tore her ACL in September. South Carolina's Feb. 2 win over Texas A&M marked the sixth different starting lineup for Staley, then a seventh in the most recent game, a 88-45 win over Mississippi State on Feb. 5.\n\nMcDaniel was part of the starting lineup on Feb. 2 but didn't start on Feb. 5, instead freshman Ayla McDowell did.\n\nAgainst Tennessee, Staley could keep the same starters from last game, especially if she wants to pound the paint inside with Joyce Edwards and Okot.\n\nMcDaniel wasn't immune to the early season injury trend, as she went down in the season opener with a knee injury then in the middle of recovering, was suspended. She missed four full games total.\n\nLulu Kesin covers South Carolina athletics for The Greenville News and the USA TODAY Network. Email her at LKesin@usatodayco.com.

    "fullText": "Harry Kane has previously spoken about his interest in trying American football once his professional football career comes to an end.\n\nThose comments led to a discussion about whether such a move would be realistic for a player who has spent years at the top level of another sport.\n\nFormer NFL player JJ Watt was later asked for his view on the idea, sharing his perspective on Kane’s chances of making the transition.\n\nWatt suggested the possibility should not be dismissed and explained why Kane’s background could be relevant.\n\nWhen discussing Kane’s ambitions of becoming an NFL kicker, Watt pointed to the striker’s lifelong experience kicking a football.\n\nHe explained that this background would give Kane a strong base if he ever committed fully to an NFL pathway.\n\n“I think with true proper dedicated training, I think Harry Kane could make it as an NFL kicker,” Watt said in 2024.\n\n“I think that his skill set, obviously having kicked balls for his entire life, then you put him with a proper kicking trainer, it’s going to go well.”\n\nWatt was also careful to acknowledge the difficulty of the role, despite liking Kane’s chances.\n\n“I don’t want to diminish the job of a kicker because it’s an extremely difficult job,” he added.\n\n“But somebody that does it at the highest level like Harry has, with proper training, I do think he’s good at it.”\n\nWatt also drew on a previous experience to explain why footballers can adapt to NFL kicking.\n\nHe recalled taking part in a field goal competition with Manchester City legend Sergio Aguero in the United States.\n\n“I did a field goal competition with Sergio Aguero in America when Manchester City came over for a pre-season tour, and he was phenomenal, making 65-yard field goals,” Watt revealed.\n\nHe explained that the biggest challenge for footballers is adjusting to NFL timing and technique.\n\n“The only difference is that he would have taken a long run-up, whereas in the NFL, you get 1.2 seconds from the time the ball is snapped, so you’ve got to take a two-step run-up and kick it, but he was pounding the ball through the upright.”\n\nWatt also added context when comparing Kane to the league’s best.\n\n“Justin Tucker is the best kicker in NFL history, so I’m not saying that Harry Kane can be that,” he continued.\n\n“But I do think that Harry could possibly, with three years of intensive everyday training, make an NFL roster, one of 32, because he’s had to do it his whole life.\n\n“And maybe a goalkeeper would probably be a better option because they have to do goal kicks.”\n\nWhy Tom Brady was confused with Scottie Scheffler preferring to be a ‘better father’ than golfer\n\nSage Steele goes off at NFL for choosing ‘anti-American’ Bad Bunny for Super Bowl 60 halftime show\n\nWhy British NFL fans should be backing the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX",

    "fullText": "Manchester United are reportedly strongly considering a summer swoop for Newcastle United midfielder Sandro Tonali.\n\nHaving spent the bulk of their summer transfer budget on bolstering their attacking department after a goal-shy 2024/25 campaign, United are now expected to shift their focus to make signings in midfield\n\nCasemiro’s announcement last month that he will leave when his contract expires has only heightened the urgency for United to find a new midfielder. There have been suggestions that the Red Devils could potentially sign more than one midfielder.\n\nSome of the players that continue to be linked to United include Adam Wharton (Crystal Palace), Elliot Anderson (Nottingham Forest) and Carlos Baleba (Brighton and Hove Albion).\n\nUnited attempted to lure Baleba to Old Trafford last summer and it’s believed the Cameroonian was keen on the transfer.  However, a deal failed to get over the line due to Brighton’s prohibitive asking price.\n\nNow, The Telegraph report that Tonali is also of interest to United as the club’s midfield plans start to take shape.\n\nAccording to the news outlet, “Manchester United have put Sandro Tonali high on their shortlist ahead of the summer midfield rebuild at Old Trafford.”\n\n“The Italy midfielder, 25, is expected to be at the heart of another transfer saga at Newcastle United after his agent revealed last week that his client is considering his future.”\n\n“United have confirmed that Casemiro will leave them in the summer at the end of his contract, leaving a hole in their midfield. Tonali is now firmly on their radar after his three seasons in the Premier League as they look at long-term options.”\n\nMike McGrath notes that Juventus want to bring Tonali back to Serie A. In addition to United, Arsenal and Manchester City are also keeping tabs on the Newcastle man’s situation.\n\nNewcastle are said to be in line to make a significant profit on the £55m they paid AC Milan for Tonali in 2023.\n\nConsidering players like Enzo Fernandez, Moises Caicedo and Declan Rice all moved for more than £100m each, Newcastle are likely to demand a sum close to this for Tonali. It remains to be seen whether United would meet such a valuation.\n\nFeatured image Mike Hewitt via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Daniel Carr popped up with an injury-time equaliser to send a thrilling MacRory Cup final to a replay as Abbey CBS fought back for a 0-18 to 1-15 draw against St Patrick's, Dungannon.\n\nLeading by nine at half-time, the Tyrone school looked on course to make up for their disappointment at the final stage two years ago, but the Newry outfit flipped momentum in the second half as they live to fight another day.\n\nThe Newry side opened well with early scores from Diarmaid O'Rourke, but St Patrick's roared into it with a sixth-minute goal when Eoin Long was picked out by Liam McGeary to race through and finish low to the net.\n\nWhile the Abbey levelled and the sides then swapped points, St Patrick's took over with the next nine points in a row.\n\nLong began with the sequence with man of the match McGeary kicking five, Lorcan McMurray with a brace and Aodhan Quinn also in the act before the Abbey summoned a reply through Keelan McEntee.\n\nFergus Toale added another, but a two-pointer from St Patrick's captain Davin McKeown pushed the gap back to nine and after a late exchange of scores, the Dungannon side held a 1-13 to 0-7 lead at the break with Abbey denied a goal late in the half with Ronan Donnelly saving from Michael O'Neill.\n\nIt seemed they were well on their way, but two early scores from O'Rourke gave the Abbey a glimmer early in the second half.\n\nStill, with St Patrick's scoring two of the next three that included McGeary's sixth from play, there was no hint of the drama that was to follow as the Abbey mounted a charge in the final quarter.\n\nDaniel McKernan's followed up a fisted effort with a two-point free and when Keelan McEntee pointed, the gap was down to much more manageable four.\n\nAbbey could have been closer, if not ahead, had some of their goal chances been converted with Fergus Toale firing wide and Daniel Carr was just off target from distance, but a McKernan score with five to go left three between them.\n\nThat gap ought to have been wiped out but for goal-line heroics by St Patrick's Ruairi O'Neill who thwarted Charlie McGrath and Odhran Reel, but momentum was with the Newry outfit as McGrath and Jack O'Mahoney brought the gap to one and then Carr completed the comeback deep in added time to force a replay on Friday, 13 February.",

After making the playoffs just five of their first seven seasons, Seattle has been a consistent presence in the postseason.\n\nThat hasn't led to a deluge of Super Bowl runs. In 50 seasons as a franchise, the Seahawks only have one Super Bowl win to show for it. It's a big one, however; a total dismantling of Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos in Super Bowl 48, 43-8. That's not Seattle's most memorable big game performance however — and I'm not referring to the litany of officiating complaints that followed their 2006 loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThe picture above lives on in sports bars across New England and in the nightmare of Seattle fans who just wanted Pete Carroll to run the dang ball. The Seahawks' last Super Bowl appearance was a dramatic 28-24 loss to the Patriots in Super Bowl 49 in February 2015. 11 years ago, Seattle faced second-and-goal with 26 seconds left. Rather than handing the ball to Marshawn Lynch, the All-Pro tailback who'd already rushed for more than 100 yards, Russell Wilson instead threw a quick slant undrafted rookie Malcolm Butler stepped in front of to effectively end the game.\n\nThis is the Seahawks' first season advancing beyond the Divisional Round since that devastating loss.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: When was the last time the Seahawks made the Super Bowl?",

    "fullText": "NFL legendary wide receiver Randy Moss didn’t mince words when addressing Pro Football Hall of Fame voters snubbing his former coach, Bill Belichick, from the Hall. Belichick’s name appeared on the ballot for the first time this year, but he will have to wait one more year to get inducted into the HOF.\n\nThe decision sparked plenty of reactions from former NFL players. Things got worse after New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft also didn’t make it. During a Sunday appearance on ESPN’s “NFL Countdown,” Moss sent a strong message to the voters and the people who put them there. He stated that if they weren’t a player or a coach, they shouldn’t have a say on who gets in.\n\n“I’m not gon’ to really sit up here and just badmouth the Hall, ’cause there are some guys that just got selected to this year’s Pro Football Hall of Fame that I do not want to take the light from,” Moss said. “But one thing about not electing Robert Kraft, not electing Bill Belichick, the one thing that I would talk to all the voters. I really believe, as a football player, if you didn’t play it, if you didn’t coach it, you shouldn’t have a vote. I don’t care who you are, I don’t care how you feel about it. Like I said, I don’t wanna take no shine away from the guys elected today, and that’s it for me.”\n\n\"If you didn't play it, if you didn't coach it, you shouldn't have a vote.\"\n\n—@RandyMoss on Hall of Fame voting after Bill Belichick and Robert Kraft were not selected\n\n— NFL on ESPN (@ESPNNFL) February 8, 2026\n\nRandy Moss was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 2018, following a terrific career as one of the greatest wide receivers the game has ever seen. Eight years later, Belichick had the chance to join him in the Hall, but things didn’t go as expected.\n\nMoss wasn’t the only legend who thought former players and coaches should be the ones voting, not writers and journalists. On Friday, he told Kevin Clark on “This is Football” that only people already in the Hall of Fame should allow or deny entrance to candidates.\n\n“I wouldn’t want the grinch who stole Christmas voting on a beauty pageant,” Sanders said.\n\nDeion Sanders believes only Hall of Famers should vote on the Hall of Fame. \n\n\"I wouldnt want the grinch who stole Christmas voting on a beauty pageant. \"\n\nI said I think writers do a good job following the league.\n\n\"No, they don't\" -Coach Prime.\n\nIncredible This Is Football pic.twitter.com/wIUcIGXeDk\n\n— Kevin Clark (@bykevinclark) February 6, 2026\n\nThe Belichick situation could result in major changes in the voting process.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\n\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NFL legend Randy Moss goes off on HOF voters after Bill Belichick snub appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior saw his side cruise to a 3-1 win over Wolves on Saturday, and while Chelsea never looked troubled, the result did not come without its concerns for the manager.\n\nTwo Cole Palmer penalties and a well-taken third from the forward sealed the points for Chelsea, helping them tighten their grip on fifth place with a four-point cushion ahead of Liverpool’s clash with Man City.\n\nIt also marked Rosenior’s fourth straight Premier League victory since taking charge. He is just the first English manager to start his tenure that way since Craig Shakespeare in 2017 and the first at Chelsea since Maurizio Sarri.\n\nHowever, the 41-year-old manager was not entirely pleased. He pointed to how Chelsea still had not put together a full 90-minute performance under him. Nine games into his tenure, he still feels that consistency is missing. There was also an attitude issue from one of his players that caught his eye.\n\nThis is a young Chelsea side, and the desire to impress has sometimes led to moments of frustration. It is a team full of self-belief, with plenty of players sure they deserve to be starting.\n\nAlejandro Garnacho is a good example of that. The Argentine, brought in for £40m last summer, has not yet fully justified the fee, but there have been signs since Rosenior took over that he can make an impact.\n\nHis performance against Pafos stood out for how well he pressed and competed – exactly what the British manager wants from his team. And the two goals against Arsenal showed he has the ability to finish as well.\n\nBut there have been difficult spells too. He struggled in Rosenior’s first game and often looked frustrated, later taken off at half-time during the win over West Ham last month.\n\nIn that context, Kieran Gill reported for The Mail that Garnacho came off the bench on Saturday and was frustrated with £25m goalkeeper Robert Sanchez for not releasing him quickly enough on the counter-attack.\n\nWith Garnacho, there is often a sense that he has focused more on his own game than on what the team needs. On Saturday, Chelsea should have been slowing things down and taking the sting out of Wolves’ momentum, not playing into their hands.\n\nWolves had just scored before the hour mark and the home crowd were really getting behind them. Chelsea needed to slow things down, keep possession, waste a bit of time and manage the game better.\n\nSanchez was doing exactly that, while Garnacho seemed more concerned with chasing his own stats. It is worth noting that the Argentine winger is still young, but he also has plenty of experience already – even if he remains a bit unpolished.\n\nIf Garnacho wants to impress Rosenior and push for a regular spot in the starting line-up, he needs to start focusing on what the team requires rather than his own agenda. Until then, it is hard to see him being anything more than an option off the bench.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers have a few key players set to hit the free agency market this offseason, one being wide receiver Romeo Doubs.\n\nDoubs is coming off one of the best years of his career in 2025, tallying 724 yards and six touchdowns, and the Packers should look to bring him back. However, Green Bay will have some competition if they let the young receiver hit the market.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, Doubs and the Packers are expected to discuss an extension and pursue a return if it makes sense.\n\n\"The door isn't closed on Doubs in Green Bay. I'm expecting both sides to at least have some dialogue and see if a return makes sense,\" Fowler said.\n\nHowever, Fowler also adds that there will be receiver-needy teams, such as the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders, who could target Doubs and make him a very rich man.\n\n\"The Raiders and Titans will have my attention for free agent receivers. Both desperately need a difference-maker on the outside,\" Fowler added.\n\nLas Vegas and Tennessee are slated to have the most cap space in the NFL this offseason, so both franchises have the money to lure Doubs away from Green Bay in free agency.\n\nThe Pittsburgh Steelers could also be in the Doubs market, especially due to his connection with quarterback Aaron Rodgers, who could return as the Steelers' starting signal-caller next season. A receiver duo of DK Metcalf and Doubs would be incredibly exciting for Pittsburgh.\n\nSpotrac projects Doubs will land a four-year deal worth $48 million, an average annual value of $12 million. That would be a fair deal for Doubs, given the state of the receiver market and his youth.\n\nWe'll see if the Packers can get something done with Doubs, or if he'll be wearing a new uniform in 2026.\n\nCardinals trade rumor could lead to deal with Steelers, Vikings or Browns\n\nAaron Rodgers career update is great news for Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n49ers trade rumor is crushing blow to possible deal with Vikings, Falcons\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't ruling out interesting career change down the line\n\nTravis Kelce rumor offers update on Chiefs superstar's future plans\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor is good news for Pats, Eagles, Cowboys",

    "fullText": "Sam Darnold has been facing challenges all throughout his time playing football since his days at San Clemente (Calif.). Now the former California high school football star will get his chance on the grandest stage of them all, Super Bowl LX, to show why he’s one of the best to have ever come out of the Golden State.\n\nThrough Darnold’s sophomore and junior seasons with the Tritons, the Super Bowl starting quarterback had seen minimal time on the field at San Clemente, totaling 748 yards and seven touchdowns. It would be Darnold’s senior year where the signal caller would blossom into his own before heading off to become a USC Trojan.\n\nDuring his senior campaign with the Tritons, Darnold had himself a strong season and ended up completing 213-of-314 passes for 2,985 yards and 39 touchdowns. The four-star prospect showed off his wheels on the ground, rushing for 785 yards and 13 touchdowns.\n\nAfter his high school playing days at San Clemente, Darnold was already committed to USC, making his decision during the summer of 2014 heading into his senior season and would head into a crowded quarterback room with the Trojans.\n\nPlaying two seasons at USC with a redshirt freshman campaign, the 6-foot-3, 221-pound passer completing 549-of-846 passes for 7,229 yards and 57 touchdowns before being selected as the No. 3 pick of the 2018 NFL Draft by the New York Jets.\n\nNow heading into Sunday’s Super Bowl matchup with the six-time Super Bowl champion New England Patriots, Darnold has a chance one more time to prove the naysayers wrong and overcoming one more challenge in his path.\n\n“Sam Darnold was sort of a late bloomer (in high school). USC had their quarterback room all set and it was gonna go from (Cody) Kessler to Ricky Town. A lot of schools early on wanted Sam to play tight end. The issue at that time he wasn’t doing a lot of camps or 7-on-7. First time I saw him at Mission Viejo 7-on-7 tournament and he was outstanding. He made all the the grows and was superb. The way his recruitment went, he to a camp at USC and Clay Helton was the HC at the time. The staff said they had to go after him at the time after seeing him. Oregon, Duke were also after him during the recruitment him. Darnold and his dad went to a lot of USC games. I think that’s a testament to his fortitude. Is it surprising, certainly. Just knowing him and his HC. Knowing he’s a tough kid. He was walking into a very tough QB at USC and he stayed resilient.” – Rivals National Recruiting reporter Adam Gorney\n\nSan Clemente High School, located in the coastal town of San Clemente, California, serves around 3,000 students from the city and surrounding areas, including Capistrano Beach and San Juan Capistrano. Established in 1964, the school is part of the Capistrano Unified School District and boasts a robust athletics program with a strong community presence under the motto “One Town, One Team.” The Tritons are recognized for their competitive spirit across various sports disciplines.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

Fears trails Duke's Cameron Boozer, Iowa State's Joshua Jefferson and Houston's Kingston Flemings.\n\nAgainst the Illini, Fears either scored or assisted on 22 of MSU's 29 made shots – almost 76%. He also had a hand in 62 of his team’s 85 points, including going 12-for-13 on free throws. His 15 assists rank fourth-most in a game by a Spartan, along with directing MSU to a 22-0 advantage in fastbreak points over Illinois (20-4, 11-2 Big Ten).\n\nFears made all seven of his free throws in overtime, though he was 7-for-19 shooting from the field in the game while playing a career-high 42 minutes, 30 seconds. It was his fifth time scoring at least 20 points this season and 10th time with at least 10 assists.\n\n“I think now, he’s understanding the level of leadership and level of maturity he needs to have,” senior Carson Cooper said. “Today, there was a lot of times where he could’ve got ahead of himself, he could’ve gotten in his head, he could've been doing extra stuff. And being able to pull this out and have the game he had is huge for him.”\n\nAccording to CBBAnalytics.com, Fears became the first major conference (Big Ten, SEC, Big 12, ACC, Big East) player since Trae Young in Dec. 19, 2017 to post 25-or-more points with 15-or-more assists in a game. Young had 26 points and 22 assists for Oklahoma in a nonconference win over Northwestern State.\n\nFears, however, did it against the No. 6 team in the country. In a Big Ten game. Against his home state rival. On national television. After a week of heightened scrutiny and debate over whether he is a gritty or dirty player.\n\n“Did he need it to validate? No. Did I need it for him to validate? No. No, guys, I don't need that, I could give a damn about that,” Izzo said. “I just was pleased that most of the time I spent the last four or five days was talking with him, because you go one of two ways when there's distractions. You want to mete it (out) and prove something – he was not in that mode at all – or you just do your job and you take care of your business.”\n\nIn Fears’ past 12 games, he is averaging 19.5 points, 9.1 assists, 2.3 rebounds and 1.2 steals. He’s shooting 91.4% at the free-throw line, going 85-for-93, and connecting on 57.5% of his 2-point shots.\n\nWhile Izzo attempted to temper praise for Fears, who is shooting just 21.4% from 3-point range during that stretch, the Hall of Fame coach and his other players also know they can only reach their ceiling and beyond behind their No. 1 engine.\n\n“Obviously, it’s been tough for Jeremy,” Cooper said. “We had to have a lot of heart-to-hearts. After Minnesota, me and Jeremy had a one-on-one a while, about 45 minutes or an hour. I needed to clear stuff up with him and kind of see where his brain was at. …\n\n“One of the biggest things I told him is Jeremy Fears is the key to all our success.”\n\nBut it didn’t come without another controversy after a week-plus of them.\n\nWith 3:23 left in Saturday’s first half, Fears was leading the Spartans in transition when he stuck his left leg out slightly and tangled his feet with Illinois’ David Mirković, who tripped and fell to the floor. Illini coach Brad Underwood appealed for a review a few seconds later, but no penalty was assessed by referee Jeff Anderson.\n\n“Obviously, I understand that everything will be magnified,” Fears said. “So just for me, it’s not even trying to get put in a position like that. Overall, I know what’s a basketball play. I wasn’t trying to trip or harm anyone. … It’s just understanding that everything will be kind of looked at now. It’s nothing I can really control – just go out there and play ball.”\n\nJeremy Fears Jr with another trip? pic.twitter.com/nMovtrrsR9\n\n— The Field of 68 (@TheFieldOf68) February 8, 2026\n\nFears’ 26 points were his third-most in his career, trailing only the 31 he scored in a Jan. 30 home loss to No. 2 Michigan, and the 29 he scored on Jan. 27 at Rutgers. It also was his 12th straight game scoring in double figures.\n\nSaturday’s second half and overtime takeover was reminiscent of the victory over the Scarlet Knights, in which Fears scored 27 points after half.\n\nIn both games, Fears attacked off the dribble and either hit a bucket in the paint or got fouled and scored at the free-throw line.\n\n“Second half, he did what he had to do,” Izzo said, “which great players do in winning time. He found a way to make some key plays.”\n\nFears leads the nation in assists per game at 9.1 (219 in 24 games), while Purdue's Braden Smith is second at 8.7 (200 in 23 games). They are the only two players in the country averaging more than eight assists.\n\nNo MSU player in history – not even Magic Johnson – has averaged more than nine assists over a full season. Johnson's 8.4 a game in the Spartans' 1978-79 national championship run is the most, and the only time a Spartan has even eclipsed eight.\n\nAlso according to KenPom.com, Fears leads the nation in assist rate, assisting on 53.5% of his teammates' baskets while on the floor. Mateen Cleaves’ school record 20 assists is seemingly within Fears’ reach on any given night. With the help of his teammates, of course.\n\nAnd they gave him plenty Saturday in a thrilling win that keeps MSU (20-4, 10-3) afloat in the hunt to repeat as Big Ten champ.\n\nSix of Fears’ assists against Illinois came on 3-pointers by the Spartans, who made seven in the game. The lone non-Fears assist came from a kickout dish from Jaxon Kohler to Kur Teng for a go-ahead 3-pointer with 8.6 seconds left in regulation.\n\nKohler posted his first double-double to end a six-game drought, finishing with 11 points and 16 rebounds that equaled his most boards in a Big Ten game in his career. Cooper, Coen Carr and Cam Ward combined to add 23 rebounds as the Spartans outrebounded Illinois, 48-38 and 7-2 in overtime.\n\nCarr (eight points, eight rebounds) delivered an electric reverse dunk on a Fears alley-oop, one of three times the two connected to get Breslin buzzing. Fears also hit Cooper (nine points, eight rebounds) for another dunk. Shooting guards Jordan Scott and Teng each scored 10 points, with reserve Trey Fort hitting his only shot, a 3-pointer.\n\nDefensively, Scott took the bulk of the time on fellow freshman Wagler, with Fears and Cooper also providing some of the different looks that flummoxed the Illini star. Wagler went just 2-for-16 from the field, finishing with 16 points and six rebounds along with just three assists.\n\n“Without them doing their jobs,” Fears said of his teammates, “we probably more than likely don’t get the win. … Everybody just did what we needed to do, and that’s what we weren’t doing the last two games.”\n\nAfter ending a two-game losing streak, closing a stretch of four games in 12 days, the Spartans next play Friday at Wisconsin (8 p.m., Fox). And despite losing shooting guard Divine Ugochukwu for the season to a broken left foot, Izzo savored what he saw Saturday, and knows the Spartans must build on it over the final seven games of the regular season.\n\n“We needed the win,\" Izzo said. \"We needed to play like Michigan State. We needed to rebound, run. We needed to get back to what we do. Are we over a hump? Hell, no. The next game, it gets tougher.”\n\nContact Chris Solari: csolari@freepress.com.

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn, one of the most accomplished female skiers of all time, is in stable condition after she crashed 13 seconds into her downhill run on Sunday in Italy. Teammate Breezy Johnson took home the gold medal in the event.\n\nVonn was intent on a comeback in the Olimpia delle Tofane downhill race and was skiing with a fully torn ACL. Several authorities have stressed the crash was not the result of her knee injury.\n\nVonn hooked her right arm and shoulder around the course’s fourth gate, which forced her entire body to the right as she jumped. She spun in the air and landed hard on the snow before she fell down the slope.\n\nThe 41-year-old skier’s comeback attempt was already legendary: Vonn came out of retirement and bounced back from the ACL tear. She was ultimately airlifted off the course and treated by staff who have since described her condition as “stable.”\n\nUpdate: Lindsey Vonn sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.\n\n— U.S. Ski & Snowboard Team (@usskiteam) February 8, 2026\n\n“Lindsey Vonn sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians,” the US Ski & Snowboard Team said in a short statement on social media.\n\nJohnson’s gold medal win comes four years after she crashed on the same course and was stopped from competing in the 2022 Winter Games. The medal was a first for Johnson and the first gold for Team USA at the 2026 Olympic Games.\n\n“I thought today’s race was going to be the most competitive alpine ski race that has ever taken place,” Johnson said. “The girls here love this course. The sun was out. It was perfect conditions on the Tofane track. And I knew that the margins were going to be fine. Hundredths matter.”\n\nJohnson will compete again Tuesday in the team combined event.\n\n“Her coach said she was cheering for me in the helicopter,” Johnson said of Vonn after the race. “I hope for the best for her. I hope it’s not too bad. My heart aches for her.”\n\nThe post Lindsey Vonn ‘Stable’ After Downhill Final Crash, Breezy Johnson Wins Team USA’s First Gold appeared first on TheWrap.",

He’s 2-0 coming back here.”\n\nHolloway backed it up with 15 points in 31 minutes, highlighted by a four-point play from the corner and a tough left-handed floater that helped stretch Alabama’s lead.

    "fullText": "MILAN — The 2026 Winter Games are off to a promising start for host nation Italy with gold, silver and bronze on the first day of medal events.\n\nBut it was Switzerland’s Franjo Von Allmen who captured the first gold medal of the Milan Cortina Olympics on Saturday.\n\nThere were no Americans on the podium, though Lindsey Vonn impressed in her second training run ahead of the women’s downhill on Sunday.\n\nItalian speedskater Francesca Lollobrigida celebrated her 35th birthday by winning the host nation’s first gold medal of these Olympics — in the 3,000 meters. It’s also Italy’s first gold in women’s speedskating at any Winter Games.\n\nCompeting in her fourth Olympics, Lollobrigida outskated Ragne Wiklund of Norway for her first Olympic gold after winning silver and bronze in Beijing four years ago.\n\nHer great aunt was the late Gina Lollobrigida, a star actress of the 1950s and ’60s.\n\nItaly had a strong day on the slopes, as well, with Alpine skiers Giovanni Franzoni and Dominik Paris taking silver and bronze, respectively, in the men’s downhill — the first medal event of the Games.\n\nHowever, neither could beat Von Allmen’s time of 1 minute, 51.61 seconds in Bormio.\n\nThe 24-year-old Swiss skier was the leader after his downhill run, but the wait for his rivals to finish was nerve-racking.\n\n“I tried to enjoy the moment, but I didn’t quite realize what was going on today,” von Allmen said after his first Olympic race.\n\nParis, 36, was delighted with his bronze after coming away empty-handed in his four previous Olympics.\n\n“It’s my fifth Olympics, and getting the first medal in front of the home crowd, that’s really special,” Paris said.\n\nIn Cortina, Lindsey Vonn completed another downhill training run and was set for Sunday’s medal race despite tearing her left ACL a little more than a week ago.\n\nThe 41-year-old American crossed the line in third position and told The Associated Press “all good.”\n\nShe has been wearing a large brace on her injured knee.\n\nYuma Kagiyama landed near-perfect quads and scored 108.67 points in his short program to help Japan put pressure on the defending champion U.S. in the figure skating team event.\n\nMalinin, the two-time reigning world champion, was second with 98.00.\n\nBut a brilliant free skate by Madison Chock and Evan Bates pushed the U.S. score to 44 points — five more than Japan ahead of the men’s, women’s and pairs free skates to decide the medals Sunday.\n\nJessie Diggins, the most decorated American cross-country skier ever, finished eighth in the 20-kilometer women’s skiathlon in Tesero. She finished more than 2 minutes behind winner Frida Karlsson of Sweden.\n\n“I had a crash on the first lap, where my tip just disappeared in the slush, and unfortunately it was a tough spot where you lose all your momentum,” the 34-year-old Minnesota native said.\n\nU.S. Vice President JD Vance sat with influencer and boxer Jake Paul as they watched the U.S. women’s hockey team beat Finland 5-0 on Saturday. Paul’s fiancee, Jutta Leerdam, is a speedskater for the Netherlands.\n\nFinland played two days after the team’s game against Canada had to be postponed because of a stomach virus affecting players. Switzerland played Canada a day after announcing that one of its players tested positive for the norovirus. Canada won 4-0.\n\nNorway — the nation with the most medals in Winter Olympics history — got its first gold of the Games in the women’s ski jumping. It was unexpected.\n\nAnna Odine Stroem of Norway won the normal hill competition ahead of Slovenian favorite Nika Prevc, who has dominated the sport this season. Nozomi Maruyama of Japan won bronze.\n\nKira Kimura won Japan’s first gold medal at these Games — in men’s snowboarding big air in Livigno. His teammate, Ryoma Kimata, picked up the silver medal.\n\nDefending champion Su Yiming of China took bronze, keeping 17-year-old American Oliver Martin off the podium.\n\nBig air consists of one single jump off a huge ramp, where the rider varies spins, flips and h",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cincinnati Bengals have some big needs to address this offseason, with the majority coming on the defensive side of the ball.\n\nBut that doesn't mean the offense will be neglected. One of the more interesting positions to monitor is backup quarterback, as Joe Flacco is a free agent.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Jeremy Fowler, the Bengals are interested in re-signing Flacco. However, Fowler warns that the Bengals, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and the Minnesota Vikings might have serious interest in signing Flacco this offseason.\n\n\"The Bengals have expressed interest in re-signing quarterback Joe Flacco,\" Fowler writes. \"But Flacco will have options, possibly as a bridge quarterback elsewhere. The Vikings considered signing Flacco last offseason. And the Steelers will have an opening if Aaron Rodgers doesn't re-sign there. Pittsburgh liked his free agency profile last offseason, too.\"\n\nWhile the Bengals might have interest in bringing Flacco back, he would strictly be a backup to Joe Burrow in Cincinnati.\n\nIf the 41-year-old is looking for playing time and not just a team to be a part of next year, then the Bengals might not be his best option.\n\nThe Vikings, with some massive uncertainty with J.J. McCarthy, and their interest in the veteran quarterback from last offseason, could be a realistic landing spot.\n\nMore: We now know if Joe Burrow is happy with Bengals\n\nThe Steelers are also a possible destination, and it revolves around the status of Aaron Rodgers. If he's back, then the Steelers likely wouldn't have interest. But if he retires or leaves for a new team, then the Steelers would be a landing spot.\n\nWith the Bengals serious interest in bringing Flacco back, the interest from the Steelers and Vikings would be some bad news.\n\nThose are better landing spots for Flacco in terms of playing time, something he could be looking for. But, if neither spot is open, or Flacco is not opposed to a reunion even as a backup, the Bengals seem likely to try to bring him back for another year.\n\nBengals urged to make NFL Draft decision they haven't made in 15 years\n\nBengals urged to overhaul 'horrific' position group this offseason\n\nBengals get good news amid $50 million contract projection for Trey Hendrickson\n\nBengals get great news on possible Chase Brown contract extension\n\nBengals young breakout CB D.J. Turner gets $41 million contract projection\n\nJa'Marr Chase, Tee Higgins make Bengals Pro Bowl history for first time since 2007",

    "description": "After pairing Maye with Jacoby Brissett as a rookie, the Patriots opted for a less expensive plan B in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The New England Patriots soared on the wings of an MVP-caliber quarterback. For two decades that was Tom Brady. In 2025, it was Drake Maye.\n\nMaye's emergence helped the Patriots rise from a four-win 2024 to a 14-3 2025 campaign. A restocked roster and the arrival of head coach Mike Vrabel helped, but the former third overall pick was the engine that drove New England back to the Super Bowl after an arduous six-year drought.\n\nWhat happens if Maye can't play in Super Bowl 60? Things get dicey, but the Pats have a contingency plan in place.\n\nNew England put training wheels on Maye as a rookie by pairing him with a solid, if unspectacular, journeyman starter in Jacoby Brissett. The Patriots allowed Brissett to leave in free agency and replaced him with a less accomplished veteran who could provide a stable floor but lower ceiling for less money.\n\nDobbs hasn't had much to do in 2025. He made four appearances, all in Patriots' blowout wins. He's been quietly efficient against disinterested defenses loaded with depth players, completing seven of 10 passes but for only 65 yards.\n\nDobbs has been in the NFL since 2017. He's best known for a handful of solid performances in 2023 while playing for the Arizona Cardinals, then Minnesota Vikings. He's a viable dual-threat quarterback who can operate enough of Maye's playbook to be a useful backup in New England.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Who is Drake Maye's backup quarterback?",

    "description": "Designing directly in the browser, using only HTML and...",
    "fullText": "As a web designer, having designed and built many websites, there are times where I have a design fully realized in my head that I would skip using a design tool and just start coding HTML and CSS to flesh out the design in the browser directly.\n\nIt started out as something I did with personal projects; then it turned to only doing black and white wireframes for professional projects before going to code. Then I started using a boilerplate HTML template for the wireframes. Now I do all my web design in the browser directly. And feel that everyone should design in the browser, no matter what level you are at with design or coding HTML and CSS. Here's why.\n\nDesign tools like Photoshop were originally made for designing graphics that would be output on a static canvas, like a magazine, or a banner. We started using them for web design because it seemed like a logical extension of their functionality. But the layout of a website doesn't really work as fixed shapes, it's more fluid, with content flowing vertically, and needing to adjust to different screen sizes.\n\nThroughout the years, design apps have evolved to be more specialized to fit different cases. I find that Sketch works best for UI/UX design for apps. And Pixelmator is great for static graphics and images. But when it comes to web design, they're all still limited. Even design apps that attempt to focus on web design like Figma still end up being shapes on a static canvas.\n\nAnother design app, Framer does a pretty good job with fluid layout, but you still end up pretty much redoing your work when you have to code the HTML/CSS for it. Webflow outputs HTML/CSS directly and follows standard practices, but it's basically just a visual CSS editor with a clunky interface that quickly becomes more cumbersome to use than just writing up some CSS code.\n\n\"Even design apps that attempt to focus on web design like Figma still end up being shapes on a static canvas.\"\n\nPart of the divide between using a design app and coding a website separately comes from how the expectation that designers don't write code, programmers do. This makes sense from the standpoint of developing an app, but it makes less sense when it comes the way a website layout works. HTML and CSS are made for structure and visual aesthetics, which is design. Programming is having to use an API to communicate with different systems for processing certain interactions.\n\nI have done print design work in the past. Graphic design for print also has technical aspects that are required that may not be considered design. By having to work within physical limitations: calculating paint color codes, and accounting for the different kinds of paper to print on. While there are people at print companies that can help with the process, you still need to understand these technical details to get the results you want. HTML and CSS are the tangible limitations of web design.\n\nAnd there is actually not very much code needed, it's more about your design decisions. You're essentially defining abstractions and giving them properties. In a design tool you would create a shape that you give a name to and set its size, color, border, whether it has rounded corners, etc. You do the same thing in HTML and CSS. You define your object layers in HTML, and format definitions in CSS. If you're a designer with experience in traditional design tools, you already understand how the model works!\n\n\"HTML and CSS are the tangible limitations of web design.\"\n\nDesigning straight in HTML and CSS code gives a live view in the browser that you're designing for:\n\nAnd once you do all this during the design stage, you're already more than half way through the coding stage! So while the traditional web design process requires more software and time. Designing in the browser cuts costs on both software and on time spent to more than half of the traditional approach.\n\nA recent trend of web design tools are setting up a design system with components to work from, making it easier to keep a design consistent and make updates in the future. This is so much easier to do in HTML and CSS as it has the cascading approach to using components built-in, without having to do a lot of initial setup.\n\n\"Designing in the browser cuts costs on both software and on time spent to more than half of the traditional approach.\"\n\nThe beauty of how HTML and CSS were designed is that there's a spectrum to the level of skill required. You can have content in a text document that outputs in a web browser. Add some HTML tags to break it up. Some CSS properties for formatting. And you have yourself a website.\n\nThe browser is the most accessible design tool there is when the goal is to publish content, which is the point of a website! It can do it all: a personal homepage, a flyer for an event, a magazine of articles, a home base for a business, a virtual store, and so much more.\n\nIt's what it means to have a democratized web. Publishing available in the hands of anyone to build and share.\n\n\"The browser is the most accessible design tool there is when the goal is to publish content, which is the point of a website!\"\n\nOvi has been designing and building websites for over 20 years via Distinctive Quality.

The specimen is assigned to †Ctenobethylus goepperti (Mayr in Die Ameisen des Baltischen Bernsteins. Beiträge zur Naturkunde Preussens, 1868), which we redescribe and re-diagnose, proposing †Eldermyrmex exsectus Dubovikoff et Dlussky, 2019 as its junior synonym (syn. nov., comb. nov.). We further infer a potential sister-group relationship with the extant genus Liometopum Mayr, 1861, suggesting that †C. goepperti may have been a dominant arboreal species in warm-temperate coniferous forests, a scenario which is supported by its abundance in Baltic amber. Critically, our results document endoskeletal structures in a Cenozoic fossil ant, underscoring both the morphological value of historical collections and the lasting scientific legacy of Goethe’s naturalist vision.\n\nJohann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749–1832), the polymathic poet, statesman, and naturalist, maintained a deep and lifelong engagement with the natural sciences, particularly geology, mineralogy, botany, and morphology. While he is most renowned for his literary works and philosophical contributions, Goethe also made original scientific observations, including his rediscovery of the os intermaxillare (premaxillary bone) in humans (Haas1, and c.f. Barteczko2), and played a key role in developing morphology as a scientific discipline. It has even been argued that Goethe’s artistic direction was of such a kind that it drove him necessarily to science (Steiner3). He conceptualized nature as a system in continuous transformation, driven by the interplay of form and function, a view that shaped his approach to classification and scientific observation. From this perspective of natural dynamism, he developed the concept of Reihenbildung (series formation) to describe orderly variation in natural systems (Mierbach4), a precursor to ideas central in evolutionary biology and systematics.\n\nGoethe’s scientific practice was deeply intertwined with his personal collections, now housed in the Goethe-Nationalmuseum in Weimar (Thuringia, Germany). Unlike many historical collections, his geological and mineralogical specimens, comprising over 18,000 objects, have been preserved nearly in their entirety and remain in their original location. Many of the objects reside in the same boxes and cabinets Goethe used, bearing his handwritten labels. This continuity offers a unique opportunity to study Goethe’s scientific perspective through the material record.\n\nWithin these collections, amber occupies only a modest place. Classified not among fossils but among combustible substances (“brennliche Wesen”), Goethe catalogued amber under fossil resins (“fossile Harze”), reflecting late 18th-century systematic conventions that grouped it with substances like bitumen and jet. A catalog from 1978 (Prescher5) listed only four amber entries; however, recent re-inventorying revealed at least 40 pieces, including two samples of “amber earth” (“Bernsteinerde”). These are housed in their original cabinet (“Schrank II”) and include specimens from the Baltic region, including Gdańsk and Pomerania. Although Goethe himself never made explicit mention of biological inclusions, and any scientific study of amber bioinclusions started only near the end of his life, especially in Germany with Georg Carl Berendt’s “Die Insekten im Bernstein” (The insects in amber) in 1830, our examination revealed three insect inclusions within two pieces: two nematoceran flies and a worker ant.\n\nHere, we present a detailed examination of this fossil ant, †Ctenobethylus goepperti (Mayr, 18686), using synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SR-µ-CT). The scan allowed for a three-dimensional reconstruction of the specimen, revealing anatomical features that were previously inaccessible, particularly the tentorium and prosternum, two endoskeletal structures never before documented in Cenozoic fossil ants. Our study provides a redescription and re- diagnosis of †Ctenobethylus, establishing †C. goepperti as a senior synonym of †Eldermyrmex exsectus Dubovikoff et Dlussky, 2019 (syn. et comb. nov.). The refined morphological assessment allows for improved systematic placement and paleoecological inference, evidencing an arboreal lifestyle in Eocene coniferous forests. Through this work we document paleontological discoveries and provide a rare synthesis of Enlightenment-era collecting and modern analytical science, illustrating the enduring scientific value of historical collections. It also invites reflection on Goethe’s holistic and integrative approach to knowledge, an approach grounded in careful observation, the ordering of nature, and the search for underlying principles that bridge form and function.\n\nWe examined all 40 amber pieces using a stereomicroscope. Most were opaque, a natural state of many Baltic amber pieces, and a sign of an ongoing aging process. Of the 40, we used synchrotron radiation to exploratorily scan 30 pieces, including the two pieces that contained the three insect inclusions. In one piece, labeled ‘ID 1552.b’, we found one ant that we identified as †Ctenobethylus goepperti (Hymenoptera: Formicidae) and a dark-winged fungus gnat (Diptera: Sciaridae) (Fig. 1, 2, 3 and Suppl. Fig. 3). The other piece, labeled ‘ID 1550.d’, contained a blackfly (Diptera: Simuliidae) (Suppl. Figs. 1 and 2). Finer identifications for the two Diptera were not achieved yet, as their state of preservation could pose an insurmountable obstacle, even with µ-CT rendering. The family identity of the two flies was confirmed via contact with an expert (pers. comm. Björn Rulik, March 12, 2023).\n\nAmber piece 1552.b showing bioinclusions.

The specific differentiation of †Ctenobethylus relative to other Dolichoderinae is addressed in the Discussion under “Systematic implications” below. For a complete description and rationale for synonymization of †Eldermyrmex, see the Supplementary Results.\n\nSystematic implications: Placing †Ctenobethylus among Dolichoderinae is not trivial. We accept the placement of the genus in Tapinomini, first proposed by Ward et al.10, based on a process of elimination, wherein we used the favored multi-gene topology of Ward et al.10 for detecting morphological consistencies across the subfamilial phylogeny. Our reasoning for each dolichoderine tribe follows below.\n\nTribe Bothriomyrmecini. Although Arnoldius, Bothriomyrmex, and Chronoxenus have largely similar mesosomal forms (mesosoma compact, dorsal propodeal face short), †Ctenobethylus cannot be placed in Bothriomyrmecini, as it lacks the synapomorphic facial modifications of the constituent genera of this tribe. Specifically, the posterior clypeal margin of †Ctenobethylus extends posteriorly between the antennal toruli (vs. synapomorphy: this margin ending at around the anterior torular margin in all bothriomyrmecine genera), the antennal toruli are wideset, separated by more than one of their own lengths (vs. closely approximated in Loweriella and Ravavy), the frontal carinae are well-defined (vs. synapomorphy: effaced in Arnoldius, Bothriomyrmex, and Chronoxenus), and the medial hypostomal lamella is well-developed (vs. synapomorphy: reduced or absent in all bothriomyrmecine genera).\n\nTribe Leptomyrmecini. The propodeum of †Ctenobethylus does not appear diagnostic at first examination but is in fact distinct in comparison to the Leptomyrmecini. Across the leptomyrmecines, the dorsal propodeal surface is distinctly developed, being longer than the posterior surface (Iridomyrmex, Ochetellus, Papyrius, Philidris, Turneria, Axinidris, Forelius, Anillidris), about as long as the posterior surface (Azteca, Linepithema, Anonychomyrma, Dorymyrmex), or distinct but shorter than the posterior surface (Nebothriomyrmex). Doleromyrma and various Leptomyrmex have short dorsal propodeal surfaces but differ from †Ctenobethylus as the former genus has frontal carinae that are close-set, and the latter has an elongate body form and lacks the medial hypostomal lamella. Certain leptomyrmecine genera are further distinguished through petiolar form (high-squamate in Iridomyrmex, Ochetellus, Papyrius), eye form (anteriorly converging in Turneria), and almost all leptomyrmecines have anterior clypeal margins that are convex or sinuate in some manner, with the most limited exceptions being Dorymyrmex and Anillidris, which have weakly convex margins but are otherwise distinguished by several other conditions (e.g., psammophore development, torular separation).\n\nTribe Dolichoderini. The highly derived Dolichoderini can be excluded, as †Ctenobethylus lacks the flange-like anterolateral hypostomal teeth, a strong, large petiolar node, and the thick cuticular sculpture. Thus, only the tribe Tapinomini remains, as apparently inferred by Ward et al.10, Shattuck11,12, and Bolton13,14).\n\nTribe Tapinomini. Within the Tapinomini, †Ctenobethylus has been previously synonymized with the extant, arboreal genus Liometopum (Shattuck15), an inference that was not explained, or otherwise considered in detail (Dlussky and Perkovsky9). Given that the petiole of †Ctenobethylus plesiomorphically retains a small but distinct petiolar node and short posterior petiolar tube, it is reasonable to exclude the genus from the Axinidris + Technomyrmex clade and from the Tapinoma crown clade. Axinidris and Technomyrmex, further, have comparatively long to definitely long dorsal propodeal surfaces. Among Liometopum and the remaining tapinomine genera, Aptinoma and Ecphorella, †Ctenobethylus clearly differs from Ecphorella in having a linear anterior clypeal margin. Fascinatingly, †Ctenobethylus is morphologically intermediate between Aptinoma and Liometopum, and the relationship of these two taxa is in a virtual polytomy with Tapinoma given the analyses of Ward et al.10 and the reanalysis of Boudinot et al.16.\n\nThe available morphological evidence suggests that †Ctenobethylus is a stem group of Liometopum: (1) the second submarginal cell is present (see Fig. 45 of plate III in Mayr6 and the venational mapping of Boudinot et al.16 in Fig. 5; vs. absent in Aptinoma; note that reduction of this cell is prone to homoplasy across all dolichoderine tribes); (2) the head is distinctly cordate (vs. very weakly lobate posteriorly in Aptinoma); (3) the teeth are relatively coarse (vs. fine in Aptinoma); (4) the petiolar node is distinctly developed, raised above the levator process, and anteroposteriorly narrow (vs. node not distinct, not raised above process, broad in Aptinoma); (5) antennomere III is about half the length of the pedicel (vs. about as long as the pedicel in Liometopum); (6) the scape is short, not exceeding the posterior head margin in repose (vs. scape long as specified in Liometopum); and (7) the body lacks elongate erect setae (vs. with such setae in Liometopum). The mesosoma of †Ctenobethylus is further similar to Liometopum in having a large, cavernous metapleural gland opening and long mesonotum. Notably, the mesonotum of ant workers does not receive musculature; thus, this is primarily a structural feature that influences the geometry of the pronotum, and by consequence, the head. Development of the metanotum and impression of the metanotal groove does not appear to have much bearing on the distinction of †Ctenobethylus relative to Liometopum and Aptinoma.\n\n†Ctenobethylus goepperti is the most frequently encountered species of ants in Baltic amber, yet its abundance has paradoxically contributed to its scientific marginalization. However, through our renewed morphological considerations, particularly the probable sistergroup relationship to Liometopum, it becomes possible to make inferences of the biology of this fossil species. In terms of abundance, it is worth re-examining specimens of †Liometopum oligocenicum to determine whether they do, in fact, belong to Liometopum. Regardless, extant Liometopum are arboreal carton-nesters and form massive colonies that may extend from tree to tree. It is therefore possible that †C. goepperti was a dominant arboreal species in the humid and warm-temperate coniferous forests of Eocene Europe (e.g., Sadowski et al.17), which went extinct during the major climatological changes leading to the present day. Dlussky and Perkovsky9 previously speculated that the robust mandibles of †C. goepperti may have been useful for an arboreal lifestyle, specifically for excavating or boring wood. Where Liometopum are absent in contemporary central Europe, possibly due to Pleistocene glaciation, they are replaced by Lasius in the niger clade, by species of both the brunneus and niger groups as well as the highly derived fuliginosus group. In this light, turnover of the temperate Eocene ant fauna in European is further evidenced by the high abundance of extinct Formica species and †Lasius schiefferdeckeri in Baltic ambers and the very young age of crown Lasius (Boudinot et al.18). Seemingly a cursed genus given its taxonomic history (e.g., Shattuck15), †Ctenobethylus now appears to be a paleoecologically important taxon, being the likely Eocene analog of Liometopum.\n\nGoethe’s legacy in the natural sciences extends far beyond his renowned Farbenlehre (Theory of Color; Goethe19) and provides the poetic impetus for the journal Nature (Huxley20; see Suppl. Text Box), but also encompasses sustained engagement with geology, mineralogy, and biological form. Best known among scientists for his rediscovery of the human premaxilla and his formulation of the Urpflanze or archetypal form in plant morphology, Goethe helped lay the groundwork for comparative morphology and the study of metamorphosis in biological systems. Through both theory and practice, Goethe emphasized perceptual and conceptual synthesis, an aesthetic empiricism that sought truth through close observation, iterative experimentation, and attention to form and transformation, i.e., Goethe’s Naturphilosophie.\n\nGoethe shaped our modern patterns of biological inquiry by being among the first to integrate ideas about structure, differential development, and process over time. In particular, he distilled organismal science into the living concepts of morphology and metamorphosis, together, a broadly applicable theoretical framework for the consideration of analogy and homology (Hall21, Levit et al.22). Distilling complex reality into perceptible patterns once earned him a commendation as “the Copernicus and Kepler of the organic world” (Steiner23), and in order to shape this mentality, he placed great emphasis on the relationship between the investigator and their object of study. Namely, comparative morphology extends beyond simple comparison of anatomical facts; it requires direct human perspective to reveal the underlying metamorphosis and broader significance. From a Goethean perspective, comparative morphology is not only descriptive but also explanatory, even complementing modern molecular approaches in evolutionary developmental biology (Toni24).\n\nAcross multiple fields of study, it becomes clear that Goethe wanted to understand time and process, not only pattern (Sullivan25). In botany, Goethe sought the form of the Urpflanze that is contained in each plant today and how it manifests as variable leaf phenotypes (i.e., its processes of development) (Goethe26). He also endeavored to draw similar conclusions about the geological world, writing at length about granite and its status as the oldest of Earth’s ancient stones. The incredible antiquity of our planet, a long history documented in text-like layers in stones and mountains, was at the time a revolutionary idea with both religious and scientific implications. Geology was just beginning to develop from a classificatory scheme into a field concerned with the Earth’s formation and evolution (Sullivan25). In this context Goethe’s geological collections are herald of the shifting scientific perspectives of the era. Furthermore, reminiscent of modern museum archives, Goethe believed collections such as the en vogue “cabinets of curiosities” were shared intellectual capital rather than personal property. In the collection-themed novella “Der Sammler und die Seinigen”, co-written with Friedrich Schiller (1759–1805), he highlights the interpersonal aspects of collecting, such as corresponding about a collection’s inheritance and comparing and transferring specimens across different collections, making clear that these information-rich assemblages transcend a single owner (Schellenberg27).\n\nAmber was not central to Goethe’s scientific output, yet it occupied an intriguing intersection of his interests. Classified in Schrank II of his mineral system under combustible substances of economic value (“Brände”), amber was grouped with resins and other organic materials rather than with fossils. His amber holdings, some 42 catalogued pieces (of which 40 could be found) today preserved by the Klassik Stiftung Weimar, were acquired primarily from contemporary dealers, or gifts from friends with synergetic interests, such as Johann Georg Lenz (1748–1832) in 1796. Goethe was familiar with the fact, that amber could contain biological inclusions, as he held a friendship with Friedrich W. H. von Trebra (1740–1819), corresponded with him, read his works, quoted it, and kept two copies of his “Mineraliencabinett gesammlet und beschrieben” in his library that states on p. 125 “[…] das Stück Bernstein […] welches ein Lorbeerblatt, und ein Paar kleine Insecten darauf einschließt” (Trebra28). Thus, while he was evidently aware of the paleontological potential of amber, he did not examine these for inclusions, as suggested by his omission of contemporary works like Sendel29 and his lack of commentary on biological inclusions. Rather, Goethe conducted optical experiments using amber, attempting to observe visual effects like entoptic phenomena. These efforts culminated in the “Entoptische Farben” chapter of his 1820 supplement to Farbenlehre, demonstrating amber’s experimental utility in Goethe’s empirical investigations of light and vision.\n\nIn pursuit of botanical, geological, and optical knowledge, Goethe shared energizing conversations with famed naturalist and explorer Alexander von Humboldt (1769–1859), who was likewise trying to understand nature through both empirical analysis and aesthetic perception. These exchanges fueled Goethe’s desire to collect and curate his personal collections, creating a continuous cycle of artistic and scientific pursuits. Even today, aesthetic considerations remain significant to scientists. In a 2021 survey of 3442 scientists, 91% reported they find it important to encounter beauty, awe, and wonder in their work; moreover, 94% believed that science helps us better access the beauty that actually exists in the world (Jacobi et al.30). More frequent experiences of wonder and awe also correlate with higher job satisfaction and better mental health.\n\nFittingly our investigation bridges Enlightenment-era inquiry and modern morphological bioinformatics, or phenomics (i.e., big-data morphology; Deans et al.31). Using synchrotron radiation-based micro-computed tomography (SR-µ-CT), we scanned Goethe’s amber collection for bioinclusions. Remarkably, only two of the 40 pieces contained visible fossil insects: two nematoceran flies and an ant, †Ctenobethylus goepperti. This study presents the first high-resolution reconstruction of the ant (Fig. 3), permitting redescription of the species and genus, documentation of internal structures like the tentorium and prosternum (Fig. 4a and b), and a new taxonomic synonymy. These findings reanimate a neglected piece of Goethe’s collections and exemplify the growing potential of historical collections for generating new scientific knowledge.\n\nTransparent 3D renders of †Ctenobethylus goepperti in amber piece 1552.b. a Head frontal view showing the tentorium. b Mesosoma seen from lateral showing the profurca, legs removed.

Collectomics treats natural history collections not merely as repositories of objects, but as structured, information-rich datasets subject to modern scientific scrutiny. Our study contributes to this emerging framework by applying advanced imaging technologies to Goethe’s archival specimens, without altering their cultural integrity, and demonstrating that even long-frozen collections can yield unexpected scientific dividends. Ongoing imaging and provenance research work will improve the accessibility of these collections for cultural and scientific research (Schmuck33). This case also reflects Goethe’s own philosophy: that truth lies in the persistent, perceptive encounter with nature, and that empirical inquiry must be grounded in both historical consciousness and aesthetic sensibility.\n\n“Weder Fabel noch Geschichte, weder Lehre noch Meinung halte ihn ab zu schauen. ”\n\n(May neither legend nor history, neither theory nor opinion, prevent him from seeing.)\n\n– J.W. von Goethe, letter to the Duke of Saxony-Gotha, 1780 (as per Safranski and Dollenmayer34)\n\nAmber can preserve biological structure at unparalleled fidelity, and the Goethe collection, preserved through cultural significance rather than scientific design, has now yielded new insights through modern imaging. Our phenomic redefinition of †Ctenobethylus goepperti demonstrates the continued potential and relevance of historical collections for systematic revision and paleobiological interpretation. Through this lens, Goethe’s own epistemological commitment to observation, metamorphosis, and morphological synthesis finds renewed relevance. This study reflects the intersecting values of historical inquiry and contemporary science: where morphology joins informatics, where amber infirms evolutionary biology, and museum collections continue to generate knowledge when examined with care and curiosity, whether these are geological, biological, or cultural (Fig. 5). In a poetic inversion, we now use advanced imaging tools to peer through the same amber Goethe once used to explore vision. While Goethe opposed artificial enhancements of perception in principle, he embraced tools like microscopes and prisms when they aided genuine observation. This study honors that spirit by integrating visual technology with empirical inquiry and highlights the enduring value of historical collections for modern science.\n\nGoethe as a Natural philosopher. a Goethe and Schiller Monument in Weimar. b For Goethe, art, science, and humanity were inextricably linked. He was particularly invested in color theory and prisms on both a physical and a philosophical level; he painted and annotated this color wheel in 180935 for his Farbenlehre to symbolize the “human spirit and soul life” (image taken from: Freies Deutsches Hochstift, Frankfurter Goethe Museum; https://goethehaus.museum-digital.de/singleimage?imagenr=35554). c Goethe collected many natural objects; this specimen is the last remaining insect in Goethe’s collections (without the amber inclusions). The label states “Curculio imperialis”, today known as Entimus imperialis (Forster J.R, 1771), an endemic beetle species from Brazil.\n\nWe examined a total of 40 amber pieces found in Goethe’s collections held in Weimar (Germany). Of these 40 pieces four are presumably ambergris (produced in the digestive system of sperm whales). The remaining 36 pieces were classified as Baltic amber (47–34 Ma) (Kosmowska et al.36, Kasiński et al.37). Six of these were not scanned, as we could already observe under the microscope that they did not hold any bioinclusions. In total 30 pieces were suitable for scanning.\n\nNo piece was ground or polished, as the objects are of significant cultural value. Pieces were cleaned with a dust blower and Super Soft Dusting Brush (Preservation Equipment Ltd. Vinces Road, Diss, Norfolk, UK). Stacks of partially focused images were taken of the amber pieces with a Canon EOS R5 equipped with Canon EF 100 mm f/2.8L Macro IS USM (Canon, Krefeld, Germany). For focus stacking, the internal camera software was used. The camera was mounted on a Kaiser copy stand (Kaiser Fototechnik GmbH & Co. KG, Buchen, Germany). The scene was illuminated with a Euromex LE.5211–230 cold light source for stereomicroscopy (Euromex, Papenkamp, the Netherlands) equipped with three gooseneck lamps to adjust light conditions and prevent reflections. Underneath the camera a blurred glass plate was positioned over a black sprayed Kapa® box (Kohlschein GmbH & Co. KG, Viersen, Germany). The amber pieces were placed on the glass plate in a petri dish filled with distilled water (Sadowski et al.38). Additional photographs were taken with the same camera and lens.\n\nIn total 30 pieces of Baltic amber from Goethe’s collections were first scanned at the Deutsches-Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), Hamburg, Germany and subsequently at the Max Planck Institute for Chemical Ecology, Jena, Germany.\n\nIn two pieces animal inclusions were found (Fig. 1 and Suppl. Fig. 1) under the light microscope, these were scanned at the DESY using synchrotron radiation (SR-µ-CT) at the Imaging Beamline p05 (IBL) operated by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Hereon at the storage ring PETRA III. A photon energy of 18 keV and a sample to detector distance of 30–50 mm was used. Projections were recorded using a 50 MP CMOS camera system with an effective pixel size of 0.46 µm. 4001 projections were recorded for each tomographic scan at equal intervals between 0 and π, with an exposure time of 350 ms. When specimens were too large to fit into the field of view in the z-axis, we scanned overlapping sections and subsequently stitched them together. Tomographic reconstruction was done by applying a transport of intensity phase retrieval and using the filtered back projection algorithm (FBP) implemented in a custom reconstruction pipeline (Moosmann et al.39) using MATLAB (Math-Works) and the Astra Toolbox (Palenstijn et al.40, van Aarle et al.41,42). For further processing, raw projections were binned two times resulting in an effective pixel size of the reconstructed volume of 0.913 µm. For segmentation and visualization, the 32-bit .tif image sequences were converted to 8-bit files and down sampled twofold with Fiji (Schindelin et al.43), resulting in an effective pixel size of 1.826 µm. Pieces with no visible bioinclusions were “pre-scanned” and checked if there are any specimens inside (see Suppl. Tables 1 and 2).\n\nAll ambers pieces were pre-scanned with a SkyScan 1272 (Bruker, Belgium) equipped with an Xray sensitive xiRay16 (4872 × 3248) (Suppl. Table 2). One of the seven pieces labeled with ID 1552.b containing †Ctenobethylus goepperti and a sciarid fly was irradiated with a voltage of 25 kV and a current of 125 µA. The exposure time for one image was 5.19 s. A pixel size of 7.4 × 7.4 µm2 was achieved. The 360° scan was accomplished in 0.2° steps. Three additional pieces, suspected of containing bioinclusions, labeled with ID 1550.d were quick scanned with the same parameters, except for source voltage of 23, 27 and 30 kV and a current of 130 µA.\n\nµCT-image stacks were segmented and 3D-reconstructed using Amira 6.0.1 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) and Dragonfly 2022.1 (Object Research Systems, Montreal, Quebec, Canada). tif image stacks and files containing the isosurfaces were exported with the Amira macro “Multi-Export” (Engelkes et al.44). The isosurfaces were reduced and smoothed under the following parameters: ItTotal: 5; smooth: iteration: 4, lambda: 0.6; reduction: 0.7. The resulting .tif image stacks were volume rendered in VGStudio Max 2.0 (Volume Graphics, Heidelberg, Germany) using the option Phong reflection model. The isosurfaces were further smoothed (modifier: smooth and option shade smooth) with Blender 3.2.0 (Blender Foundation). The 3D-Models were uploaded to the 3D model repository Sketchfab (https://sketchfab.com) using the free blender plugin: Sketchfab for blender 1.5.0 (https://github.com/sketchfab/blender-plugin/releases/tag/1.5.0).\n\nThere is no doubt the material is any other than Baltic amber, an assumption confirmed by spectroscopy for amber piece 1552.b. Since these amber pieces are highly brittle as a result of their basic storage conditions in the hallway to Goethe’s “Arbeitszimmer” (study room), a small piece unintentionally broke off of specimen 1552.b, the piece that contains two bioinclusions, during transportation and scan preparations. The crumb was sent to the International Amber Association (IAA; Gdańsk, Poland) for UV fluorescence and Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). The results showed that the piece is true Baltic amber (Report No 41992_17022023). Due to their inestimable cultural value, we refrained from examining further pieces. As this would mean sending the whole amber pieces to the IAA or cutting off small flakes, that would bear the risk of harming the objects.\n\nRenders of the synchrotron-scanned specimen were used to evaluate gross morphology as well as structures that are otherwise hidden or internal; the specimen could not be clearly seen under standard light microscopic conditions. As needed to evaluate given characters, comparisons were made to images hosted on AntWeb45 and the literature, particularly Richter et al.46,47,48,49,50 and Boudinot et al.51 for the tentorium. For the prosternum, we referred to Aibekova et al.52 and Aibekova et al.53. Terminology used for description and discussion follows these references for the head and mesosoma, with the addition of Lieberman et al.54 for the metasoma. Detailed comparisons of worker morphology were made for the following genera based on AntWeb (numbers in square brackets indicate taxon sampling within the indicated tribe): Bothriomyrmecini [5/5] (Arnoldius, Bothriomyrmex, Chronoxenus, Loweriella, Ravavy); Dolichoderini [1/1] (Dolichoderus); Leptomyrmecini [16/16] (Anillidris, Anonychomyrma, Azteca, Doleromyrma, Dorymyrmex, Forelius, Froggattella, Gracilidris, Iridomyrmex, Leptomyrmex, Linepithema, Nebothriomyrmex, Ochetellus, Papyrius, Philidris, Turneria); Tapinomini [6/6] (Aptinoma, Axinidris, Ecphorella, Liometopum, Tapinoma, Technomyrmex).\n\nMeasurements were taken from the 2D orthographic renders in parallel perspective of the fossil in full-face and lateral view using Adobe Illustrator.

    "fullText": "Hud is the first Runtime Code Sensor designed to make AI-generated code production-safe by default. Installed in under a minute, it captures structured, real-time, function-level runtime data from your live systems and streams it directly into your IDE.\n\nOnce deployed, Hud overlays each function in your codebase with live production context. You can map execution patterns, capture behavioral changes, and pinpoint performance regressions - all without dashboards, manual instrumentation, or context switching.\n\nThrough Hud’s MCP server, supported code-generating agents like Cursor, Copilot, and Windsurf gain visibility into how your code actually behaves in production-enabling them to generate safer, system-aligned code.\n\nHud is read-only, requires no config, and adapts automatically as your application evolves.\n\nHud is built for engineering teams integrating code-generating agents or shipping mission-critical services into production. It’s especially valuable for:\n\nCoding agents use Hud’s MCP server to detect and investigate production failures, surfacing relevant functions, error sources, and execution patterns-without relying on manual logging or tracing. \n\n→ Issues are surfaced with root cause attached \n\n→ Responses include contextual details: behavior trends, exception types, and code flow impact \n\n→ Coding agents successfully solve elaborate issues automatically using the context Hud provided\n\nWhen proposing a fix, the agent queries Hud to retrieve production behavior for affected functions: error propagation, caller relationships, and performance data. This context enables safer and more accurate modifications-grounded in real system behavior.\n\nBefore applying changes, the agent queries Hud to assess implications against current runtime context-including execution flow, load impact, and behavioral sensitivity. This ensures that edits won’t introduce regressions.\n\nHud allows agents to operate with continuous access to production context-through structured, queryable signals captured by the Runtime Code Sensor. Every step-issue detection, resolution, validation - is backed by live data, transforming speculative AI output into production-safe code.",

    "description": "is a bet on better code gen and more...",
    "fullText": "... is a bet on better code gen and more complexity\n\nAI engineering wants to be declarative. Ultimately, the algorithms in language model attention heads which devs interleave with their Python and Typescript are fuzzy and inscrutable.\nTheir natural abstractions are guarantees, predicates on co-images. We can’t know what they do, only what they will have done.\n\nThis is fine when AI software is 99% Python logic and 1% AI. Most software accesses SQL databases, but that’s not a problem - the interaction is tightly scoped and managed.\nBut what happens when the software is 99% AI and 1% Python, at least in terms of complexity/headspace?\n\nAt that point, the software is poorly served by the imperative paradigm. There may be plenty of LoC, but as far as it’s owner is concerned, there’s nothing imperative about it. At that point, much of the actual logic of the program lives in … the heads of its developers.\nThe prompts won’t speak for themselves - each maintainer will, as a byproduct of hours of whiteboarding and painful trial-and-error, have reams and reams of knowledge regarding how different AI components interrelate with one another that simply cannot be safely deduced from the code itself, possibly even by a superintelligence.\n\nStoring critical system information solely in human minds - and doing so more often as time goes on and AI becomes a bigger part of software - is not a good idea. The I/O bandwidth is low, the information degrades quickly, and collaboration scales poorly.\nIts a structural trend directly counter to the massive productivity gains the rest of software is seeing - and it’s holding AI software development back.\nEvals can sometimes help introduce some structure and legibility, but they’re too fragmented - the requirements your engineers care about are distributed across hundreds of test cases you will never read and likely struggle to version and update.\n\nAs time goes on, teams and engineers will want AI systems like Synth to help them - and, to be most effective in controlling and intervening on the software, those systems will need a legible and durable source of truth.\nFinding the right abstractions will take time, but now is the time to start.\n\nEvery abstraction is leaky, and so directly maintaining imperative Python in AI software will be a necessity for the foreseeable future. But, great engineering teams will use processes and tools to ensure that the system specification is syncronized and takes precedence. PRs and prompt updates can be compiled up into spec diffs, and rejected if they introduce breaking changes.\nSyncronization in the other direction is where the abstraction starts paying for itself.\n\nAdd a requirement -> AI spools up 1k LoC and Synth stress-tests two new prompts and a sub-agent, with 5 new evals to boot. Evals just become a way to check guarantees and create impetus for the compiler to update prompts/code/LoRAs.\nNaturally, syncronization will sometimes go both ways. Adding a better model might require simpler code with fewer prompts, depending on how preferences are outlined, and so we might go models -> evals -> spec -> code -> evals -> spec. Suddenly equilibrium becomes a more apt description than compilation. But don’t let that scare you away.\n\nDeclarative specs with guarantees aren’t new. They’ve been used as long as software’s been written. Engineering teams benefit greatly from clearly communicating system level guarantees, and maintained them even back when it took precious human-hours to do so.\nWhat is new is intelligence that helps us consistently and cheaply transpile between them and software in a git commit hook. Let’s use it.",

    "fullText": "T-Mobile is taking drastic action to retain its customers amid elevated switching activity and growing competition.\n\nAfter previously rolling out free offers and device promotions to boost loyalty, the carrier has now launched two new phone plans to stop customers from fleeing.\n\nEarly last year, T-Mobile announced price increases for its older phone plans and raised a key fee that customers pay on their bills, sparking backlash. It also omitted taxes and fees from its phone plan pricing and booted select customers off of older phone plans without their permission.\n\nThese changes appeared to have had a domino effect as T-Mobile later revealed in its most recent earnings report that its postpaid phone churn (the percentage of customers who canceled their service) spiked by 3 basis points year over year during the third quarter of 2025.\n\nPhone plan pricing has been a major pain point for consumers nationwide. Last year, a survey from WhistleOut found that T-Mobile customers spend an average of $68 per month on a single-line phone plan. Due to high phone plan pricing, T-Mobile risks losing 75.9 million customers.\n\nAmid this risk, T-Mobile quietly introduced a new phone plan called Experience More with Appreciation Savings, which is available to eligible customers under unknown criteria, according to internal documents obtained by The Mobile Report.\n\nThis plan is similar to T-Mobile’s Experience More plan, but it’s more affordable. A single line on Experience More with Appreciation Savings starts at $75 per month, compared to $85 per month with Experience More.\n\nFor two lines on Experience More with Appreciation Savings, it starts at $120 per month; three to eight lines add $30 each, and nine to 12 lines add $40 each.\n\nThe prices of three or more lines match the Experience More plan prices, meaning the savings on the new plan are really concentrated on those first two lines.\n\nIt is also important to note that trade-in credits on Experience More with Appreciation Savings are equivalent to those offered on the Experience More (55+, First Responder, and Military) versions.\n\nThis new plan is also eligible for free line offers. This means that customers who already have a free line on another phone plan can transfer it to the Experience More with Appreciation Savings plan if they switch to it.\n\nThis plan also includes perks such as a five-year price lock guarantee, a free Netflix subscription, and Apple TV+ for $3 per month.\n\nThe second phone plan T-Mobile launched is a Loyalty Plan, which has been around for some time as a retention offer.",

    "description": "During an appearance on \"Real Time\" Friday, former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said Republicans praise President Donald Trump in public but secretly bash him in private.",
    "fullText": "Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said that while many Republicans praise President Donald Trump while in public, some of those same figures criticize him in private, naming outspoken Trump ally Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., as one example.\n\nDuring an appearance on \"Overtime,\" the online part of \"Real Time with Bill Maher,\" Friday, Christie was asked by former Canadian Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland what \"Republicans say to each other when we're not listening about what's happening in America right now.\"\n\n\"Look, so many of my fellow party members, especially, come up to me because I say all this stuff out loud, and they — in the green room at ABC, they'll say, 'You're so brave. That's so great. I totally agree with you. [Trump's] nuts.' And then they go out on camera to be interviewed, and they go, ‘The greatest president since Abraham Lincoln,’\" he replied. \"And then they come back in the green room, and they say to me, 'You know, I have to do that, but like I don't really mean it.' That's what they say.\"\n\nGraham Threatens Shutdown Deal Over House-backed Repeal, Warns Johnson: 'I Won't Forget This'\n\nFollowing up on Christie's claim, host Bill Maher asked the former governor which specific Republicans are engaged in this behavior.\n\n\"Bill, 'Overtime's' not long enough to give you all the names, but I'll give you one. Lindsey Graham,\" he told Maher, drawing shocked reactions from both the panel and audience.\n\nFox News Digital reached out to Graham for comment, but did not immediately hear back.\n\nGraham Blocks Trump-backed Spending Plan, Calls It A 'Bad Deal' As Shutdown Nears\n\nChristie and Trump have had a complicated relationship over the past decade. Although he endorsed Trump after ending his own presidential campaign in 2016, their relationship soured after the president refused to concede the 2020 election to former President Joe Biden, and Christie later openly criticized Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\nWhile facing calls from fellow Republicans to drop out of the 2024 GOP presidential nomination race, Christie put out a campaign ad promoting the fact that he's been the \"only one\" from his side of the aisle calling out Trump.\n\nGraham Pushes Back On Tillis' Criticism Of Noem, Miller For Labeling Man Killed By Border Patrol A 'Terrorist'\n\n\"Some people say I should drop out of this race. Really? I’m the only one saying Donald Trump is a liar,\" Christie said while speaking directly to the camera.\n\nChristie's campaign said the commercial was the first spot in what they tout as a seven-figure ad buy in New Hampshire, the state that held the first primary and second overall contest after Iowa's caucuses in the GOP presidential nominating calendar.\n\nChristie charged in the ad that Trump \"pits Americans against each other,\" adding that the then-former president's Christmas message to anyone who disagrees with him was \"Rot in hell.\"\n\nFox News Digital's Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "fullText": "The following is the transcript of the interview with Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former FDA commissioner, that aired on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan\" on Feb. 8, 2026. Dr. Gottlieb also sits on the boards of Pfizer and United Health Care.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: We turn now to former FDA commissioner, Dr. Scott Gottlieb. He is also on the board of Pfizer and United Healthcare. Dr Gottlieb, welcome back.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have a history of making accurate predictions that are also terrifying on this program, and it was around this time last year that you said you were very concerned about the measles outbreak and that it would spread. You're right. In South Carolina, about 900 reported cases, largest outbreak since measles was declared eliminated. You got out in Disneyland in California, two cases. Here in DC, cases detected. Should we avoid mass gatherings? How concerned should we be?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I don't think we should be worried about mass gatherings at this point. I think that this is going to get worse unfortunately, before it resolves. Last year, we had 2000 cases. This year so far, we have 750 cases reported. It's going to be a lot higher by the end of the year. I think this is going to be a long cycle right now. If you look at the people who are getting infected with measles, the majority of people are between the ages of five and 17. They're not toddlers, and we're seeing vaccination rates decline among toddlers, really, as part of a broader movement away from pediatric vaccines in this country, as those toddlers age into school age settings, the scope of the measles outbreaks are going to continue to escalate in this country. If you think back to the early 1990s, 1991 there were about 25,000 cases of measles. 1992 we had about 10,000. Vaccination rates had declined in the 1990s only about 88% of Americans children were vaccinated for measles, mumps and rubella. Right now it's about 90% but in some of the states where you're seeing these outbreaks, the rate is as low as 81% in Alaska. 88% in a number of states that are having outbreaks right now. So we're starting to get down to lower levels, and I think that's going to continue to decline. And again, as these children who aren't getting vaccinated age into school age settings, they're going to start spreading broader and larger outbreaks. So I think this is a long cycle, especially now that this has gotten embedded in political psyche in this country. I think this is a generational change.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Yeah, well, and those, those percentages you point out are important because we're below herd immunity. And as I understand it, it's not just the United States, Britain, Canada, Spain, a number of European and Central Asian countries lost their measles elimination status. This is a global anti-vaccine movement, it would seem.\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think that that's right. And I think a lot of this comes out of the Covid pandemic, where people felt compelled to take vaccines that they had hesitations around through state action. I thought that was a mistake at the time. I still think its mistake we talked about in this show that would breed an anti-vaccine backlash. And I think that's what we're seeing, and it's given voice to a lot of people who are anti-vax from the outset, who are now gaining political resonance and starting to drive a lot of the policy agenda, including at the Department of Health and Human Services. So the scope of these is going to continue to grow. It's not just MMR, it's diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis as well. We're seeing pertussis outbreaks in this country. Those are going to continue to grow. So we're in a long cycle right now, and I think it's important that we continue to educate people about the importance of these vaccines, especially the MMR vaccines. Measles is very contagious, and as you said, the herd immunity rate is about 95% vaccination in a community in certain pockets of this country, we're well below that. You look at some states, there's pockets as communities where their vaccination rate is about 70% and so that's where you're seeing the outbreaks, particularly in South Carolina, Texas, Florida has an outbreak right now. There's been big outbreaks in Utah and Arizona as well. Arizona had 250 cases. Utah, about the same.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: There was a hearing this week with Dr Jay Bhattacharya. He's the NIH director. He did say people should get their measles shot. But he was pressed about vaccines, and he was testifying under oath, and here is what he said.\n\nSEN. BERNIE SANDERS: Do vaccines cause autism? Tell that to the American people, yes, no.\n\nJAY BHATTACHARYA: No, I do not believe that the measles vaccine causes autism.\n\nSEN. SANDERS: I didn't ask measles. Do vaccines cause autism?\n\nJAY BHATTACHARYA: For- I have not seen a study that suggests any single vaccine causes autism.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: I played those remarks because I think it's important to hear them directly. The director claimed the next day in a social media post that he was mischaracterized and that he's fully aligned with Secretary Kennedy on finding the root cause of autism. Why is the messaging so muddled here? Is it that political embeddedness you talked about?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Look, I think a lot of the appointed officials in the sdministration who work for Secretary Kennedy are reluctant to buck the secretary on this and the secretary has been a long standing anti-vaccine advocate. He really led the charge throughout the last two decades for the anti vaccine movement, and now that he's in that position, he's able to give much more voice to it and embed it in official policy. You know, Jay's comments there were very carefully worded. He said no single vaccine causes autism. The only vaccine that's been studied, as he pointed out in his Twitter post extensively is- is the MMR vaccine. So he backed away from those comments the next day, I think because he and a lot of other officials are reluctant to buck the secretary. Mehmet Oz this morning was speaking to this issue, and he was very clear, and that's what I would expect of him. He's a good physician. He was very clear on the importance of getting the MMR vaccine. I think it's important that more officials step forward with those very clear messages.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: You have an op-ed talking about your personal experience with cancer, and you link it to past infection with a virus. Can you explain that?\n\nDR. SCOTT GOTTLIEB: Yeah, look, I think a large part of the anti-vaccine dogma, if you will, is that these infections aren't that serious to begin with, and therefore any risk theoretical or actual from the vaccines themselves isn't worth it. It's not worth taking the vaccine to mitigate a virus that in and of itself is incidental. That's not true. I had Epstein-Barr Virus. It led to the development of a B cell lymphoma. We know that HSV-1 is associated with Alzheimer's disease. Enterovirus is associated with type one diabetes. We now believe EBV virus is associated with multiple sclerosis and may be a causative factor in lupus as well. So viruses do have long term sequela.\n\nMARGARET BRENNAN: Well, Dr. Gottlieb, it's an important read and another good point. Thank you for your time today. We'll be right back.\n\nLuigi Mangione yells out in court as judge sets New York trial for June\n\nRacist video shared by Trump depicting Obamas as apes taken down\n\n50 years later, the Eagles' greatest hits still soar",

Bahama Breeze Island Grille is closing all of its restaurants within the next few months.\n\nThe tropical-themed chain’s parent company, Darden Restaurants, announced Tuesday that it will close all 28 remaining Bahama Breeze locations by April 5, 2026.\n\nThe company made the decision after completing a strategic review of the brand, which has struggled to compete with sister restaurants such as Olive Garden and LongHorn Steakhouse. The closure follows a years-long evaluation of the brand’s performance amid shifting dining habits and increased competition.\n\nDarden plans to convert 14 existing Bahama Breeze locations into other restaurant concepts within its portfolio. The company stated it will support employees through the transition as operations wind down over the coming months.\n\nBahama Breeze’s remaining locations are in Florida, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, and Washington. At the chain restaurant’s peak, it had 43 locations nationwide.\n\nClosures will be staggered to allow customers a final chance to visit. Darden has not yet released specific closing dates for individual locations.\n\nBahama Breeze, which opened its first location in Orlando, Florida, in 1996, was loved for its signature items like conch fritters and tropical drinks. The chain, however, remained more of a regional favorite than a national powerhouse.\n\nBesides Olive Garden and LongHorn, Darden Restaurants also owns Yard House, Ruth’s Chris Steak House, Cheddar’s Scratch Kitchen, The Capital Grille, Chuy’s, Seasons 52, and Eddie V’s.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Tourists to Milan during the Winter Olympics hoping to see Leonardo da Vinci’s “ The Last Supper” were in for an unwelcome surprise: Access to the masterpiece is closed to the public for 3 1/2 days.\n\nThe painting, created between 1494 and 1498 by the Italian Renaissance artist, is located on a wall inside the refectory of Santa Maria delle Grazie, a church and Dominican convent still used by friars. It is a major attraction for appreciators of art and devout Catholics alike.\n\nTourists stuck at the police cordon down the street leading to Santa Maria delle Grazie were disappointed. Antonio Rodríguez, who traveled from Spain with friends, said they would have no other chance to see the painting nor the adjacent church since they only traveled for the weekend.\n\n“We didn’t know we would face this,” said Rodríguez, adding he had no plans to attend events related to the Games. \"We would have gone somewhere else in the city.”\n\nA sign on the wall outside Il Cenacolo Vinciano stated that access to the landmark would be closed all day on Feb. 5, 6 and 7, and the morning of Feb. 8, without giving any reason. Staff there told a reporter from The Associated Press they were not authorized to provide any information.\n\nVIPs still allowed in on Saturday\n\nUnbeknownst to frustrated visitors, multiple groups of VIPs were exempt from the restrictions on Saturday.\n\nAmong them were U.S. Vice President JD Vance and his family, according to a statement from the vice president's office. They visited the morning after he met Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and attended the Games' opening ceremony.\n\nVance converted to Catholicism in 2019, which he has said brought him a sense of spiritual fulfillment. He visited Rome and Vatican City during Holy Week last year, and was among the last world leaders to meet Pope Francis before his passing. They sat down together on Easter Sunday after a long-distance tangle over the Trump administration’s migrant deportation plans.\n\nIn addition to Vance, many foreign delegations have visited The Last Supper and the Brera Art Gallery in recent days, including those of China, Poland, Hungary and Bulgaria, Angelo Crespi, the director of Grande Brera that oversees both institutions, said in a statement.\n\n“We interpret our role responsibly, not only in terms of tourism but also in terms of international relations,” he said.\n\nTraffic in the area surrounding the religious site on Saturday was diverted. People walking along nearby streets said public transportation was disrupted, as well.\n\n“The trams were changed without any notice,” said Fedeli Gioia. “This whole area is blocked because someone is going to see Il Cenacolo? And where does that leave us citizens?”\n\nA painting that — with care and luck — has survived for centuries\n\nThe Last Supper — described by renowned writer Giorgio Vasari as “a beautiful and marvelous thing” in his writings — is preserved under strict conservation conditions.\n\nInstead of creating a fresco that would have allowed the paint to be absorbed by plaster, Leonardo used a dry technique that made it much more vulnerable to deterioration. Environmental damage and repeated restoration attempts altered its appearance and prompted ongoing conservation efforts.\n\nNowadays, visits last about 15 minutes for a maximum number of 40 people at a time and temperature and humidity are strictly controlled.\n\nLeonardo’s painting depicts the moment after Jesus tells his apostles: “One of you will betray me.” The scene’s composition has had other interpretations by previous artists, but Leonardo reinterpreted it, placing Jesus at the center and arranging the apostles in four groups of three figures.\n\nAside from conservation issues derived from the dry technique used by Leonardo, the mural suffered deterioration when the refectory housing it was used as a stable in the late 1700s during the French occupation of Milan by Napoleon’s troops. Later, it was severely damaged when Allied bombing struck the Santa Maria delle Grazie complex in 1943 during World War II.\n\nIt made a controversial appearance, of sorts, in the Paris Olympics in 2024. A scene in the opening ceremony evoked the painting, and included DJ Barbara Butch — an LGBTQ+ icon — wearing a silver headdress resembling a halo while flanked by drag artists and dancers.\n\nFrance’s Catholic bishops said it mocked Christian symbolism, and the Vatican said it “deplored the offense” caused to Christians by the scene.\n\nA group of Japanese tourists was among the would-be visitors behind the police cordon on Saturday. They photographed the church from a distance and listened to a guide’s explanation in the middle of the street.\n\nLuisa Castro, a Filipina who has lived in Milan for 20 years, was hoping to visit Santa Maria delle Grazie with friends.\n\n“We are Catholics from the Philippines and we seldom have time to visit a church like this,” she said. “Unfortunately, the vice president of America came to see the Last Supper and we could not enter.”\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Organizers in Monterey Park took inspiration from other US cities to fight against the construction of a giant datacenter\n\nWhen a southern California city council proposed building a giant datacenter the size of four football fields last December, five residents vowed to stop it.\n\nThrough a frenetic word-of-mouth campaign, the small group raised awareness about the proposed facility in Monterey Park, a small city east of Los Angeles known affectionately as the country’s first suburban Chinatown.\n\nNo Data Center Monterey Park organizers – working in tandem with the grassroots racial justice group San Gabriel Valley (SGV) Progressive Action – held a teach-in and rally that drew hundreds of participants, knocked on doors, and distributed flyers on busy streets.\n\nThey emphasized how the computer systems facility would strain the power grid, drive up energy rates and create noise pollution. A petition quickly amassed nearly 5,000 signatures. All the materials were shared in English, Chinese and Spanish – a concerted effort to reach Monterey Park’s diverse populace, which is two-thirds Asian and one-quarter Hispanic.\n\nIn just six weeks, the community won. City leaders issued a 45-day moratorium on datacenter construction and a pledge to explore a permanent ban.\n\n“It’s like the third act of an Oscar-winning movie,” said Steven Kung, a co-founder of No Data Center Monterey Park.\n\nOver the past year, homegrown revolts against datacenters have united a fractured nation, animating local board meetings from coast to coast in both farming towns and middle-class suburbs. Local communities delayed or cancelled $98bn worth of projects from late March 2025 to June 2025, according to research from the group Data Center Watch, which has been tracking opposition to the sites since 2023. More than 50 active groups across 17 states targeted 30 projects during that time period, two-thirds of which were halted.\n\nThe movement against these facilities has even made for strange bedfellows, bringing together nimbys and environmentalists in Virginia, “Stop the Steal” activists and Democratic Socialists of America organizers in Michigan.\n\n“There’s no safe space for datacenters,” said Miquel Vila, lead analyst at Data Center Watch, a research project run by AI security company 10a Labs. “Opposition is happening in very different communities.”\n\nDatacenters have exploded in states with abundant land, cheap power and generous tax breaks. Though the facilities power everything from streaming services to artificial intelligence, functioning as an engine for our digital lives, few people seem to want these sites that drain enormous amounts of water and energy, causing energy costs to soar. A November Morning Consult poll found that a majority of voters support banning datacenter construction near where they live and say “AI datacenters” are partly responsible for rising electricity prices.\n\nVila said a spike in media coverage from national outlets, particularly of protests in the north-east and midwest, had helped consolidate local campaigns against datacenters into a movement. The proliferation of the centers “has become a hot topic at a national level, which reinforces local dynamics”, Vila said.\n\nIn Indiana, a datacenter hub with more than 70 facilities, local communities are fighting another 50 projects and have halted at least a dozen in the past year, according to data from Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer and environmental advocacy non-profit.\n\n“It’s like a revolt in the heartland,” said Bryce Gustafson, who organizes with the Citizens Action Coalition. “There’s an unbelievable amount of pushback, bipartisan and non-partisan, against these datacenters.”\n\nThe datacenter rebellion in the Republican stronghold of Indiana, he said, was built in part on a strong backlash in recent years against solar projects on farmland that many residents felt threatened the state’s rural character. The same concerns over land privatization and tech overreach carried over to the fight against datacenters, as conservatives and environmentalists joined forces to organize town halls, conduct canvassing training and file lawsuits to block developments.\n\n“For many Hoosiers, datacenters have become a physical manifestation of their mistrust of big tech, the elected officials who have embraced them, and the system that allows all this to happen,” Gustafson said.\n\nLocal fights against AI infrastructure have even begun to turn the tide at the state and federal levels as the midterms approach. In Virginia – the datacenter capital of the world with more than 600 facilities – the newly elected governor, Abigail Spanberger, campaigned on lowering utility bills by ensuring that AI companies are paying “their fair share” of electricity costs rather than passing them on to consumers. The progressive lawmakers Bernie Sanders and Rashida Tlaib have publicly backed calls for a datacenter moratorium. GOP leaders, including the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, and Missouri senator Josh Hawley, have also introduced bills to regulate AI.\n\nIn Monterey Park, concerns over the proposed datacenter are primarily about its economic, environmental and public health impact. The facility would employ 14 on-site diesel generators, which researchers said produce “ambient air pollutants”, such as nitrogen oxide, that are linked to a host of respiratory illnesses, including asthma and lung cancer.\n\nOrganizer Hrag Balian said No in Data Center Monterey Park took inspiration from other communities’ organizing, including protests in Virginia and Pennsylvania that have stalled projects. “None of us had experience doing this, so seeing patterns and parallels have been tremendously helpful.”\n\nKung said a core tenet of the group’s organizing strategy was building coalitions with different community organizations in the greater San Gabriel Valley area, such as SGV Progressive Action, Asian Youth Center and Montebello Teachers Association. All these community groups mobilized their own members to show up and testify at the January city council meeting. “It’s a decentralized movement,” Kung said.\n\nAndrew Yip, a community organizer with SGV Progressive Action who helped create flyers and organize rallies, said the campaign succeeded because residents were able to put aside their differences and rally around a single cause: halting a development that would affect their livelihoods.\n\n“This is about community members rising to the occasion to look out for one another,” Yip said.\n\nFor Monterey Park organizers, the fight is far from over. Rather than gutting the proposed facility themselves, city council members are considering placing the decision before voters on the November ballot. Kung said the move would put the onus on residents to develop a “long, drawn-out awareness campaign” about datacenters for the remainder of the year. In the meantime, the organizers have continued to engage new neighbors, gather signatures for the petition, and show up at council meetings.\n\n“We won a victory, but there’s still a lot of work to do,” Kung said.",

    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nBeneath Earth's surface lies a kingdom of undiscovered microscopic life. These \"intraterrestrials\" survive in some of the harshest conditions on the planet — and scientists are hunting for these microbes.\n\nIn this excerpt from \"Intraterrestrials: Discovering the Strangest Life on Earth\" (Princeton University Press, 2025), author Karen G. Lloyd, a microbial biogeochemist at the University of Southern California Dornsife, examines the idea of evolution among life that can survive for hundreds of thousands — if not millions — of years in a dormant state and what it might be waiting for to \"wake up.\"\n\n\"Intraterrestrials\" is short-listed for the Pen/E.O. Wilson Literary Science Writing Award.\n\nHow does one evolve to stop growing for thousands of years? Recent work suggests that microbes buried deep in oceanic seafloor sediments may be doing just that. Such organisms can be referred to as intraterrestrials, small microorganisms living inside Earth's crust all around the globe. To answer this tough evolutionary question, first we have to think about what these organisms would experience in their lifetimes. These slow organisms wouldn't be concerned about the length of a day. They're buried so deep that they can't detect the sun anyway. They probably wouldn't even notice a change in season.\n\nHowever, they might care about other, longer geological rhythms: the opening and closing of oceanic basins through plate tectonics, the formation and subsidence of new island chains, or new fluid flows brought on by slow formation of cracks in Earth's crust. The biology I was taught in school considered these events to be evolutionary drivers for a species, not an individual.\n\nFor instance, Darwin's finches evolved new beak shapes because they had been isolated on an island with a particular shape of seed to eat. This evolution happened over the geological timescale of island formation, but it occurred in a species lineage, not in an individual bird. We know, however, that individuals are also capable of changing along with the rhythms of their environment. An individual Arctic fox's (Vulpes lagopus) fur changes from white to brown when the snow melts every spring. Many people (though sadly, not me) wake up at the same time each morning without the aid of an alarm. Daily and yearly rhythms seem like reasonable things for a person or an animal to keep track of.\n\nIce ages, less so. Anticipating changes over longer timescales seems ridiculous. It would be silly to suggest that an individual finch would have evolved the ability to swim because it had an innate anticipation that its island would subside into the sea in 100,000 years. Or that a beetle in the Gobi Desert could only reproduce when it ate an Amazon rainforest seed because it was born millions of years ago when South America and Africa were nestled into each other, and its DNA instructed it to reproduce when the tectonic gap closed again.\n\nThese scenarios make no sense for animals, but they may be reasonable for the intraterrestrials. An individual that lives for a million years might be evolutionarily predisposed to count on something as slow as island subsidence in the same way that we are evolutionarily predisposed to wait for the sun to rise tomorrow. To fully understand intraterrestrials, we may have to rethink what qualifies as an evolutionary cue.\n\nThe fact that living cells likely exist in a nongrowth state for very long timescales raises two important questions. Can a microbe be adapted to avoid cell division for thousands of years or longer, rather than having it just happen by accident? And, if so, how does evolution work for an organism that seemingly never produces offspring?\n\nLet's tackle that first question by stating it this way, in order to help us place this finding in the context of Darwinian evolution. Are these microbes evolutionarily adapted to hang out in this undead, dormant state for thousands or millions of years, or do they just persist because cells don't need any special adaptations to stay alive for so long?\n\nTo me, living for hundreds of thousands of years seems unlikely to happen without adaptation. Too many physiological changes are required to support this lifestyle for it to be a side effect of a \"normal\" fast-paced life. Furthermore, if this lifestyle is accidental, then their main growth-supporting lives must occur in some other environment. But we rarely see the types of microbes we find in the subseafloor elsewhere. It's not as if they were normal seawater microbes happily swimming around, dividing and growing when they fell to the seafloor and forgot to die.\n\nOn the contrary, most of this highly diverse group of microbes seem to exist only in marine sediments. Given this, they may be just as selected for in marine sediments as parrots are in a rainforest. Indeed, we find that at increasing depths in marine sediments, microbes make enzymes with a higher specificity for the type of substrates that are available in the subsurface, suggesting that they are specially adapted for this environment.\n\nSubsurface microbes also have adaptations that enable ultraslow metabolisms and cell divisions. This suggests that they are somehow evolutionarily poised to be in a long-term nongrowing state. But here we have a problem. According to Darwin's theory of natural selection, these cells must grow and make new progeny to evolve. Natural selection works because, during reproduction, organisms experience mutations. And when an organism has a mutation that is beneficial, the mutation increases the organism's fitness, so the organism's progeny outcompete those of the nonmutated organisms, resulting in more progeny that have the mutation. These further generations continue to do better than the nonmutated lineages, and eventually the mutation spreads throughout the population.\n\nVoilà, adaptation has occurred through natural selection. But how can we even think about Darwinian evolution in populations that don't reproduce? How can you become adapted to not have babies? I don't think Darwin had nongrowth in mind when he described survival of the fittest.\n\nLuckily, we have a good model in short-term seasonal dormancy. Here dormancy during winter has an evolutionary advantage because the dormant organisms have larger populations remaining once conditions are ripe for growth again in the spring. These organisms thus have a head start on other organisms and can pass their dormancy genes along to a larger population of progeny in the spring and summer.\n\nThis is textbook Darwinian natural selection. Let's extend that model to dormancy that lasts for thousands of years in marine sediment. We have to think of an event that intraterrestrials could possibly be waiting for that would pull them out of dormancy when they're buried hundreds of meters deep in Earth's crust. If we encounter a dormant microbe in soil in winter, we can presume that it's waiting to start growing again in summer. What is the equivalent situation for a deeply buried marine sediment organism that is dormant for thousands to millions of years?\n\nLet's do a thought experiment to jailbreak our brains from our implicit assumptions about lifespan. Imagine human lives only lasted about 24 hours. You'd be born at midnight, rebel against your parents at breakfast, settle down and have babies just before lunch, and pick up fishing as a retirement hobby around dinnertime. By midnight, your loved ones, who themselves were only born a few hours ago, would huddle close and hold your hand as you'd pass away peacefully at the ripe old age of a day. If everyone did that, hundreds of human generations would come and go within a single winter. Throughout that time span, which would represent a significant chunk of human history, the deciduous trees would remain brown and lifeless.\n\nThe permanent deadness of trees would be taken as an undisputed fact, and scientists like me would probably write grants to understand whether or not trees are alive, given that they don't seem to grow or make progeny. Of course, if you stretched back far enough, humans would have been present for the fall or even summer, but that might have been so many generations back that a stable form of writing had yet to be invented.\n\nWe 100-year-lifespan humans know that trees are just waiting to take advantage of the summer sun. But the day-lifespan humans would be stumped. When we think about life in the subsurface, are we like day-lifespan humans contemplating a tree? Are long-lived intraterrestrials waiting for wake-up cues we don't recognize because our lives are too short to see them? What is even the point of living for hundreds of thousands of years anyway?\n\nThere must be some reason these intraterrestrials stick around so long. There is evidence that long-term dormancy has a selective advantage. When you let the laboratory workhorse Escherichia coli sit around with no food for months or even years, many of the cells enter a state of long-term dormancy where they are alive and metabolizing, but they're not growing nearly as quickly as they do when you feed them. If you mix these next-to-dead E. coli with a fresh batch of fast-growing E. coli and starve them both, the old geezers beat the living daylights out of the sweet little young 'uns.\n\nThis growth advantage in stationary phase (GASP) may be the secret to why intraterrestrials live so long. Maybe they're waiting for something that only happens thousands of years later so they can be the ones to take advantage of the new situation. They might act as monks, accustomed to deprivation while the gluttons die around them.\n\nSo what are these microbe-monks waiting to wake up for? Seasonal cycles are way too fast. The only things slow enough are geological processes. For instance, island subsidence, floods, drought or storms often occur on hundred- to thousand-year cycles. Submarine landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis and volcanic eruptions might shift materials around on even longer timescales, exposing intraterrestrials to new food sources that coax them out of dormancy after hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nIt seems odd to say that a microbe is adapted to wait for something as infrequent as a volcanic eruption, but Earth's history shows that you can rely on volcanic eruptions, as long as you've got time to wait for them.\n\nIf we really let our imagination run wild, individual microbes might be adapted to events with even longer periods like glacial cycles, which shift every 30,000 years or so. Or the slow movement of tectonic plates. As new seafloor pops up in mid-ocean ridges, the existing seafloor is constantly being pushed away from the middle of the ocean, like a person standing on a moving walkway at an airport. The seafloor eventually jams into a continent in the slowest-motion train wreck ever. Some of the sediments and the intraterrestrials that live in them will get dragged on the subducting plate down to eventually be crushed at temperatures and pressures that kill all life as we know it.\n\nEven for extremophiles, being dragged all the way down to the mantle would definitely be an evolutionary dead end. However, some of the sediments that are in the early stages of being subducted under continental plates might be returned through cracks and fissures that open in the overriding plate. During this collision, some of the seafloor sediments are shoved upward in accretionary prisms and the attendant faults created by earthquakes or other plate deformations.\n\n—Scientists 'reawaken' ancient microbes from permafrost — and discover they start churning out CO2 soon after\n\n—'Black swan' pathogens from ancient permafrost may be getting ready to wake up\n\n—Hidden 'biosphere' of extreme microbes discovered 13 feet below Atacama Desert is deepest found there to date\n\nCould all this piling up, faulting and burbling up to the surface be what the intraterrestrials are waiting for? Let's think through the implications. This would mean that the individual microbial cells that we pull up in our drilling ships that appear to be dormant are just waiting patiently for the ultraslow movement of the plates to squish them into a continent, where they have a chance of resurfacing and recommencing growth.\n\nThe evolutionary payoff for waiting for millions of years in deep marine sediments would be to return to the upper seafloor again where the food is more nutritious, at which point the microbe would pass its genes along to future generations. Like any standard Darwinian natural selection, the individuals that have the best adaptations to being dormant for millions of years would have a growth advantage once they arrive back to the surface, ensuring that those adaptations become stable in the communities.

    "fullText": "As terrible recent conflicts have shown, the fighter aircraft is far from dead and can prove vital for a nation’s survival.\n\nThe most modern fighters can shoot down an enemy aircraft at a range of 100 miles, perform precision attacks against multiple ground targets simultaneously and grant their pilots a godlike level of situational awareness across thousands of square miles of ground, sea or air.\n\nModern fighters need to be extremely potent, as they are massively expensive and so available in ever smaller numbers. Some fighter types emphasize stealth, others electronic wizardry, performance, or durability, but each is ingeniously conceived for the same deadly purpose: destroying an enemy as quickly as possible.\n\nConceived as a light, simple, and energetic dogfighter, the ‘Viper’ (as it is informally known) has matured into a complex middleweight, multi-role aircraft but remains a nasty opponent in the ‘knife-fight in a phone booth’ of close air combat. Despite this, the US Air Force, the type’s primary user, has largely used the F-16 in the ground-attack role.\n\nThe F-16 is the most common modern fighter and is operated in many air arms around the world. Operators of the F-16 include the US, Bahrain, Belgium, Chile, Portugal, Denmark, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Indonesia, Israel, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Greece, Turkey, Taiwan, Thailand, Oman, the UAE, Morocco, Romania, Singapore, Slovakia, South Korea and Venezuela.\n\nThe latest versions have extremely capable sensors and modern cockpits. Though it lacks the performance of the newer generation of fighters, especially at higher speeds and altitudes, it remains highly credible. As an American fighter, it enjoys access to a wide variety of sophisticated sensors, weapons, and systems.\n\nThe F-16 is not stealthy and lacks a long-range air-to-air missile, meaning there are scenarios where it could be at a dangerous disadvantage against an aerial opponent armed with either the European Meteor, Russian R-37 or Chinese PL-15 all of which outrange the F-16’s AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missiles (AMRAAM).\n\nDespite its population and budget, Sweden has defied expectations to create a series of highly capable, and extremely innovative fighter-bombers.  While better known for their cars, since the 1940s, the Swedish company Saab has been in the combat aircraft game, enabling Sweden to uphold its position of declared neutrality; it however joined NATO in 2024.\n\nSeemingly spurning macho desires to make fighters ever faster, heavier, and more expensive to operate, Swedish manufacturer Saab took great care to emphasize more sensible and boring qualities with the Saab JAS 39 Gripen. This effort led to a maintainable fighter punching well above its lightweight and small size.\n\nFor a modestly sized nation whose government does not have global dominance on its agenda, the key aim is deterrence, ensuring that any country wishing to invade or dominate you cannot easily do so. For such a nation, Gripens armed with the Meteor long-range air-to-air missiles might be the ultimate air defender, especially when combined with a well-integrated air-defence system and dispersed bases.\n\nNever being far from the border or a base, fuel and even weapons-load don’t matter so much, because the Gripen can scoot back to a cave base and re-arm and refuel. The Meteor enables threats to be defeated while keeping out of their missile range. The next generation Gripen E will merit a higher position in any top 10 once it enters full frontline service.\n\nRussia’s MiG-31 is at the opposite end of the weight and size spectrum of the diminutive Gripen. It is not a fighter as such, but a heavyweight interceptor designed to defend against bombers from long distances. Conceived in the Cold War, it remains in service today where it offers a unique combination of unbeatable top speed – 3000 km/h – and long-range missiles in the form of the R-37M.\n\nAs a defender against bombers, the MiG-31 may well be the most potent interceptor in the world. Being such a large country, Russia has to have a big, fast aircraft capable of covering a large distance at high speed to meet the threat.\n\nBeing big means that a big sensor and long-range weapons can be carried, and the Foxhound’s Zaslon-M radar is indeed large, as are the Foxhound’s R-33 and R-37 missiles. You may be less concerned about signature and platform manoeuvrability because your ideal approach will be to stand back and hit bombers rather than engage fighters.\n\nThe reasons it does not rank higher in this list are three-fold: It is likely the least stealthy of all modern fighter aircraft being extremely easy to detect on either radar or with infra-red sensors (thanks to its massive hot engines). Russian sensors and electronics are not as effective as Western (or Chinese) sets, and as such, the MiG-31 pilot is at a situational disadvantage despite the brute force of his large radar and access to data-linked information.\n\nIn the 1970s, the Soviet Union created the Sukhoi Su-27 (pictured), an extremely large air superiority fighter (assigned the NATO reporting name ‘Flanker’) largely to counter the US F-15 Eagle. It remains in service around the world today with many air forces, including China, India, Russia and Ukraine.\n\nThe Su-27 can carry a very large number of air-to-air missiles (12), fly great distances – and at lighter operating weights (when it is not carrying much in the way of fuel or weapons) demonstrates astonishing levels of manoeuvrability, which in some variants is aided by thrust vectoring. Its large powerful radar is capable of detecting aircraft at extreme ranges.\n\nThe Sukhoi Su-35 (pictured) represents the most advanced Russian ‘Flanker’ but other candidates for the most potent member of the Flanker series include the Chinese J-11D and J-16. The latest Chinese Flankers are radically updated aircraft with reduced radar cross section and are fitted with active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, something not carried by any Russian Flankers.\n\nFlankers are easy to see on radars due to their size and shape, though their defensive electronics are highly regarded. Russia’s attempt to replace the Flanker with the Su-57 ‘Felon’ has not gone well, with only a small number of Su-57s created to date. The Su-57 is stealthier than the Su-35 but is not yet at a credible level of maturity to be included in this list.\n\nIn the 1980s, China was making military aircraft equivalent to those made in the 1960s in the US and USSR. Since then, China has leaped forward, creating some of the most capable types currently in production, its lighter J-10, and JF-17 narrowly avoiding placement in our top 10. Other than its radically upgraded Flankers, Chinese most potent fighter is the J-20.\n\nChina is the second nation in the world to put an indigenous stealth fighter into operational service. With its extremely long-range anti-air weapons, this relatively stealthy platform could prove formidable. It has the size to carry a lot of fuel, and a very large internal weapons bay, providing sufficient volume for a wide range of weapons.\n\nStealth, supercruise – the ability to cruise at supersonic speed without afterburner - and modern weapons mean the J-20 is likely to mature into an extremely capable aircraft, unique in role. Achieving this depends on the degree to which China can overcome its problems with engine development. The J-20 is less stealthy than the F-22 and F-35, one F-35 pilot has stated that he doesn’t believe the J-20 is low-observable in a meaningful sense.\n\nFurther knowledge about this type may earn it a higher ranking in this list, but little concrete is known about it. That this, along with the immature and troubled Russian Sukhoi Su-57, are catalysts for the next generation of fighters is a sign that it is taken seriously in high circles.\n\nThe mainstay of the United States Navy, the Super Hornet is a multi-role fighter-bomber designed to operate from aircraft carriers. It is loved by its crews for its excellent systems, reliability and ease of handling, a vital quality for an aircraft that has to land safely on aircraft carriers.\n\nThe Super Hornet is akin to a luxury sports car without a big enough engine: it has all the ‘bells and whistles’ (a very powerful advanced radar, reduced radar cross-section, an excellent cockpit, data-linking capability and good weapons) but lacks the grunt to make the most of its superb systems at higher speeds and altitudes.\n\nAt lower airspeeds, no aircraft without thrust-vectoring, is more agile than the Super Hornet. Its almost supernatural ability to point its nose in any direction it wants is legendary, as is its ability to fly High Alpha manoeuvres (flying with the nose raised relative to the direction of flight).\n\nThe weapons carriage – the way the bombs and missiles are carried – is among the draggiest of any fighter. If the US Navy receives the new-generation long-range air-to-air missile it wants, it is likely that the Super Hornet will be the first to receive it. Along with the Rafale, the Super Hornet, with its superb systems and weapons, is one of the best all-rounders.\n\nThe Eurofighter Typhoon is all about power and performance. It is one of the fastest climbing aircraft in the world (perhaps the fastest) and one of the best turning. Created by the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy and Spain, it is perhaps the best-armed fighter in the world for beyond-visual-range combat.\n\nThe Typhoon is very fast, high flying and energetic, imbuing its AIM-120 Advanced Medium-Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM) and Meteor missiles with a longer reach than those launched by lower-performance aircraft. It is combat-proven in both the air-to-ground and air-to-air roles.\n\nIt is also armed with two of the very best infra-red guided short-range missiles, the exceptionally fast ASRAAM and the extremely agile IRIS-T. The Typhoon pilot can wear an advanced helmet that can both display vital information and assign targets – making the pilot’s job much easier.\n\nPoints that count against the Typhoon are its major cost and absence of radar stealth technologies. Its cockpit interface is not the most modern, nor is the radar fitted to the Typhoons operated by most of its operators. The Typhoon has proved popular with the air forces of the Middle East.\n\nFew fighters have been so highly regarded for so long as this large American fighter. Despite first flying as far back as 1972, the best-equipped Eagle remains among the deadliest fighters in the world. The Eagle’s kill-loss ratio in aerial combat of 104:0 is without precedent and is unmatched by any other fighter in history.\n\nThe Eagle combines a large world-class radar (in some variants) offering unmatched detection range, with great range and a large missile load. Unlike European, Russian and Chinese counterparts it currently lacks a long-range air-to-air missile, a serious omission that means it can be shot before it can shoot back in some long-range scenarios.\n\nThe F-15 is operated by the air forces of the United States, Japan, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Korea and Qatar. The F-15A/C series is optimised for the air superiority role, whereas the F-15E Strike Eagle is designed for ground attack and multi-role use.\n\nThe most advanced F-15 variant in full operational service is likely the F-15QA. The next variant for USAF, the F-15EX Eagle II currently in service in small numbers, will be the best-equipped fighter in the world and will be radically different to the Eagle of the 1970s.\n\nFrance’s Dassault Rafale is a multirole fighter-bomber available in both land-based and aircraft-carrier-compatible variants. It is perhaps the best all-rounder on this list, with only the Super Hornet offering serious competition. It is well-armed and can carry the long-range Meteor air-to-air missile, as well as the shorter-ranged MICA, and carries what is likely the best aircraft gun, the 30-mm GIAT.\n\nThe Rafale pilot enjoys excellent situational awareness thanks to a wide range of capable sensors, including a small but sophisticated electronically scanning radar and a highly regarded suite of defensive electronics. The Rafale is designed to switch easily between roles on the same mission with exceptional rapidity.\n\nThe Rafale can also carry laser- and GPS-guided bombs, anti-shipping missiles and cruise missiles. The aircraft enjoys very brisk acceleration rates and has excellent manoeuvrability, especially at lower altitudes – and has held its own in exercises against the best fighters in the world.\n\nThe Dassault Rafale does not enjoy the same levels of high-speed high-altitude performance as the Typhoon and Raptor due to a more modest thrust-to-weight ratio. It also lacks the stealth of the F-35 Lightning II and the F-22 Raptor, but despite this, it is a highly regarded and widely respected fighter.\n\nThe Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II was designed to excel in the attack role and to be used in conjunction with a specialised air-dominance fighter (the F-22), but its stealth and the situational awareness it gives its pilots make it a fearsome opponent in the beyond-visual-range fight in its own right.\n\nAccording to RAF Wing Commander Scott Williams, the BVR capabilities of the F-35 are ‘second to none, really. First to see is first to shoot is first to kill. I recently heard a comment from someone that “flying the F-35 is like going into a boxing match and your opponent doesn’t even know you’re in the ring yet!”\n\nWilliams notes of the boxing comparison, “I like that comment because our lethality in the F-35 is enhanced by being able to deliver the killer or knockout blow to our opponents before they get enough awareness on what’s going on to prepare or do something about it.”\n\nThe F-35 is about stealth and situational awareness at the cost of the rather more- exciting traditional fighter virtues of speed and turn-rates. It is available in a conventional land-based variant, the A, a short-take-off and vertical landing (STOVL) aircraft version, the C, and a naval version with larger wings.\n\nCreating the world’s best fighter aircraft costs a great deal of money, and the US spared little expense in developing the superlative Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor. The Raptor was created in the late Cold War to rival two new Soviet fighters, the MiG-29 and Su-27, both of which were a serious challenge to US supremacy. Additionally, a new generation of Soviet surface-to-air missiles threatened to shred any conventional, non-stealthy, aircraft approaching Warsaw Pact forces.\n\nCombining the then-new technology of radar stealth (making the aircraft harder to detect by radar), supercruise (the ability to get to and sustain faster than sound speed without recourse to afterburner) and integrated avionics seemed to offer the solution. It was very expensive, even for a US military programme, but the result was impressive.\n\nSince entering service in 2005, the Raptor has utterly dominated every other fighter facing it in training exercises. The first of the so-called fifth-generation fighters, the F-22 Raptor is still the fighter to beat. Combining uncanny situational awareness, with stealth, high-speed (Mach 2.25 with afterburner - or 1.82 without it) and exceptional manoeuvrability aided by steerable thrust nozzles, the Raptor is a nightmare for any fighter to defeat.\n\nEven today, the closest rivals (the immature and rather rare Su-57 and Chinese J-20) are considered less stealthy than the F-22, making them vulnerable to this aging but formidable heavyweight. On the downside, the F-22 lacks range, is extremely maintenance-heavy, and is available in relatively small numbers. Only America uses the plane, and currently has around 183 F-22s. Only with the next generation of fighters will the Raptor be truly outclassed, an incredible achievement for an aircraft project started in the 1980s.\n\nFollow Hush-Kit's incredible aviation stories on Substack and X\n\nIf you enjoyed this story, please click the Follow button above to see more like it from Autocar",

    "description": "Last year, 44% of home listings were subject to an HOA, up from 34% in 2019.",
    "fullText": "Few aspects of modern living bring out such passionate detractors — and defenders — like homeowners' associations.\n\nThe private organizations govern neighborhoods, collecting dues that fund services such as trash removal and maintenance of shared amenities like pools and private parks. Many also enforce a slew of rules on everything from lawn care standards to acceptable paint colors to trash can storage.\n\nHow have HOAs become more common in existing homes?\n\nDo HOAs significantly impact home values and sales?\n\nWhat should buyers consider before purchasing HOA properties?\n\nWhy are HOA fees rising so rapidly?\n\nSurveys have found that most homeowners feel neutral to good about HOAs, though horror stories about their downsides — fines for minor violations, board meetings that devolve into screaming matches, surprise monthly fee hikes — regularly go viral on social media. Inevitably, the top comments are fierce pledges to never live in a neighborhood with an HOA.\n\nFor many homebuyers, though, that’s getting harder. HOAs, once primarily a feature of new-construction communities, are now growing more common in the resale market. Last year, 44% of existing homes for sale were under an HOA, up from 34% in 2019, according to Realtor.com.\n\nThe rapid increase stems from modern development trends. In the past decade, builders have focused on constructing amenity-filled neighborhoods. Around two-thirds of all new single-family homes built in recent years have had HOAs, and among condos and townhomes, the share is even higher. As original owners of those homes move on and list their homes, today’s buyers find themselves in a more HOA-concentrated market.\n\n“It’s been the trend in new construction to build more of these shared things and communities, and that has led to HOAs making their way now into the existing market,” said Joel Berner, senior economist at Realtor.com.\n\nHOAs first began to proliferate in the 1960s and 1970s, alongside the development of suburbs. As municipalities struggled to keep up with rapid growth, many required developers to include HOAs in their projects. Those deals shifted responsibility for some infrastructure upkeep, like road maintenance, from the government to the associations.\n\nThe prevalence of HOAs varies by region. They’re most common in Mountain West states that have seen an influx of new construction, like Arizona, Nevada, and Colorado, as well as places like Florida, Hawaii, and Washington, D.C., where condos are common. In more rural areas, they’re comparatively rare.\n\nKelly Wilson-Prior, a Realtor in Mesa, Ariz., where most homes are governed by some form of an association, said she assesses buyers’ lifestyles before recommending HOA or rarer non-HOA neighborhoods. Buyers with recreational vehicles, for example, are often stymied by associations’ parking restrictions. But others are specifically seeking out amenities like a neighborhood pool or community pickleball courts.",

    "description": "Top House Democrat says president’s suggestion for Republicans to ‘take over’ elections really means ‘steal it’",
    "fullText": "Democrats will stop Donald Trump from trying to steal this year’s midterm elections, Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic leader in the US House of Representatives said on Sunday.\n\nJeffries comments come amid widespread concern after Trump said Republicans should “take over the voting”. The US constitution gives states the power to set election rules and says Congress can pass laws to set requirements for federal elections. The constitution gives the president no authority over how elections are run.\n\n“What Donald Trump wants to do is try and nationalize the election – translation: steal it. And we’re not going to let it happen,” Jeffries said during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. He added that Democrats so far had successfully blocked Trump’s efforts to federalize the national guard countered a nationwide push by Republicans to redraw congressional district boundaries to their advantage.\n\n“This is going to be a free and fair election,” Jeffries said. It “is going to be conducted like every other election where states and localities have the ability to administer the laws”.\n\nThe Trump administration for months has been sowing doubt about the integrity of this year’s midterm elections by filing lawsuits against states suggesting they are improperly maintaining their voter rolls. The FBI also undertook an unprecedented raid of the election office in Fulton county, Georgia, last month, seizing ballots and other voter information related to the 2020 election. Allegations of fraud have been debunked repeatedly in Fulton county, yet Trump has continued to repeat false claims about the county.\n\nLater in his interview on CNN, Jeffries condemned Trump’s refusal to apologize for a racist post on his Truth Social account depicting Barack and Michelle Obama as apes. The White House deleted the post on Friday amid widespread outcry and said a staffer was responsible for posting it.\n\n“He definitively needs to apologize. It was a disgusting video and the president was rightly and appropriately and forcefully denounced by people all across the country,” Jeffries said. “Democrats and even a handful of Republicans who finally showed some backbone in pushing back against the president’s malignant, bottom-feeder-like behavior.”\n\nSenator Adam Schiff of California also said it was clear Trump was trying to interfere in the election and also questioned why Tulsi Gabbard, the director of national intelligence, was at the Fulton county raid.\n\n “He fully intends to try to subvert the elections. He will do everything he can to suppress the vote. And if he loses the vote, and I think the Republicans now expect they’ll get a real drubbing in the midterms, he’s prepared to try to take some kind of action to overturn the result. And we really shouldn’t question that,” Schiff said during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. “I think all of this is intended to send a message. And the message is: ‘We will not tolerate or accept an election that we lose.’”",

Addressing the record outbreak of measles in the U.S., particularly in South Carolina, Bash asked Dr. Mehmet Oz on State of the Union Sunday: “Is this a consequence of the administration undermining support for advocacy for measles and other vaccines?” “I don’t believe so,” the Trump-appointed Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Administrator responded. He then said, “We’ve advocated for measles vaccines all along. Secretary Kennedy has been at the very front of this.”",

    "description": "A Ukrainian-born Russian citizen has been extradited to Moscow from Dubai on suspicion of gravely injuring one of Russia's most senior",
    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Feb 8 (Reuters) - A Ukrainian-born Russian citizen has been extradited to Moscow from Dubai on suspicion of gravely injuring one of Russia's most senior military intelligence officers, Russian security officials and investigators said on Sunday.\n\nLieutenant General Vladimir Alexeyev, deputy head ​of Russia's vast GRU military intelligence service, was shot three times on Friday with a Makarov pistol equipped with a silencer in ‌an apartment block on the Volokolamsk highway in northern Moscow, according to investigators.\n\nAlexeyev, 64, was rushed to hospital and underwent surgery. His wife told a Russian war blogger on Sunday that Alexeyev ‌had regained consciousness and was able to talk.\n\nThe Federal Security Service (FSB), the main successor to the Soviet-era KGB, said in a statement that a Russian citizen named Lyubomir Korba was detained in Dubai on suspicion of carrying out the shooting.\n\nRussian investigators said Korba, born in the Ternopil region of Soviet Ukraine in 1960, was tasked by Ukrainian intelligence to carry out the shooting. Russia said Ukraine was behind the shooting but Kyiv has denied involvement.\n\nRussian media showed masked FSB officers escorting a blindfolded ⁠man from a small jet in Russia in the ‌dark.\n\nThe FSB said it had identified two accomplices, also Russian citizens. One, Viktor Vasin, was detained in Moscow, while another, Zinaida Serebritskaya, escaped to Ukraine, Russian investigators said.\n\nThe UAE did not release details about how Korba was detained.\n\nThe shooting of such a senior Russian intelligence official just 12 km (7 miles) north of the Kremlin has underscored the vulnerability of top Russian generals involved in executing the war ​in Ukraine.\n\nSome in Russia have questioned how Alexeyev could be tracked in such a location and why he was not guarded better.\n\nThe head of the ‌GRU, Admiral Igor Kostyukov, has been leading Russia's delegation in negotiations with Ukraine in Abu Dhabi on security-related aspects of a potential peace deal.\n\nBehind the front lines of the deadliest conflict in Europe since World War Two, Russia and Ukraine's military intelligence agencies have fought a shadow \"hybrid\" war involving cyber attacks, disinformation campaigns, strikes at strategic infrastructure, and killings.\n\nSince December 2024, three other officials of the same rank as Alexeyev have been killed in or near Moscow.\n\nSince the start of the war in 2022, Ukrainian military intelligence has claimed responsibility for assassinating several senior Russian officers, some of whom have appeared on a public list of Ukraine's ⁠enemies.\n\nUkrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha told Reuters on Friday that Ukraine had nothing to do ​with Alexeyev's shooting.\n\n\"We don't know what happened with that particular general - maybe it was their ​own internal Russian in-fighting,\" he said.\n\nThe GRU, like the FSB, is a vast and powerful Russian intelligence agency that includes sleeper agents abroad, special forces units and advanced cyber capabilities.\n\nJailed Russian nationalist Igor Girkin, who has repeatedly scolded Russian generals for what ‍he says the shambolic prosecution of ⁠the war, praised Alexeyev's energy and courage but said the attack was a significant setback.\n\n\"This is a serious blow to our special services,\" Girkin, himself a former FSB officer, said on Telegram.\n\nAlexeyev came to national prominence in June 2023 when he was shown trying to calm down Yevgeny ⁠Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenary group, during a failed mutiny.\n\nIn a video, Alexeyev listened as Prigozhin said he had come to take then-Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu and Russia's top ‌general, Valery Gerasimov.\n\n\"Take them then,\" Alexeyev said with a chuckle.\n\nThe mutiny fizzled and Prigozhin died in a plane crash two months later.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Reuters; Writing by Gleb Stolyarov; Editing by Guy Faulconbridge and Aidan Lewis)",

    "description": "Kevin Hart transformed his fitness with sprinting, HIIT, and full-body exercises like cleans and presses to keep fit in his 40s, his trainer said.",
    "fullText": "At 4:30 a.m. you'll find Kevin Hart in the gym.\n\nWhile he's best known for being a comedian and actor, Hart trains like a serious athlete: six days a week, about an hour and a half a day, no excuses.\n\nIt started over a decade ago, when Hart approached trainer Ron \"Boss\" Everline with a pitch to break into the fitness industry in major way.\n\n\"He wanted to get on the cover of Men's Health,\" Everline told Business Insider. \"I said I'm the man to help you get there — if you listen to the rules.\"\n\nEverline's rules are simple: lifting weights, high intensity exercise, and consistency get results.\n\nAnd he delivered. Hart made the cover of Men's Health in 2015, then again in 2020, and plenty of other magazines in between.\n\nNow 46, the star is still going hard in the gym, and his workouts prioritize longevity more than ever.\n\n\"Age doesn't really factor into what we're capable of. Training in a certain fashion keeps you young and vibrant,\" Everline said. \"The workout, to me, stays the same. It's how much you load up.\"\n\nHis rules for getting shredded haven't changed: here's his best advice to get in shape for years to come.\n\nEverline started his fitness aspirations with dreams of going pro in the NFL, and kept his mindset of training like an elite athlete.\n\nHis workouts with Hart incorporate full-body training for speed and power, with moves like squats, cleans, presses, and lunges. A typical week focuses on leg exercises on Monday, chest exercises on Wednesday, shoulders and back on Thursday, and full-body Friday and Saturday (with an active recovery day for light cardio on Sunday).\n\nOver the years, the exercises haven't changed much, but Everline said their approach is less about lifting as heavy as possible and more about building resilience.\n\n\"The lifting now is more tailored toward more mobility and stretching. As you get older, it's less load,\" he said. \"Muscle is a foundational principle as you get older. The more muscle you have, the better you are.\n\nEverline, 41, said that the key to progress with weights is to challenge your body with quality reps to put your muscles under stress over time, but you don't need to go all-out.\n\n\"Lifting super heavy, it's not necessary for growth. It's really time under tension,\" he said.\n\nThe biggest change between working out in your 40s is that you can't just walk into the gym and start throwing weights around, according to Everline.\n\n\"I think there's a lot more warming up and getting the body primed versus when you're 25, you just go into the gym and go,\" he said.\n\nWarming up at the gym prepares your body to perform the same movement patterns you'll be doing in the workout, and activates the right muscles to make the most out of your workout and prevent injury.\n\nHart's workout routine includes plenty of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) on full-body workout days.\n\n\"We sprint a lot to get our heart rate up and keep us super young,\" Everline said.\n\nDrawing on his athletic background, Everline puts Hart to work with outdoor running sessions at the track with repeated intervals of 100 or 200 meters, supplemented by some 1-minute treadmill sprints.\n\nExtensive research shows getting your heart rate up for short bursts is a great way to prevent disease and even helps to stave off aging.\n\n\"Most people don't sprint after a certain age,\" Everline said. \"If you continue to use it, you can still run a sprint when you're 50 or 60, and that's why it's a foundational principle for us.\"\n\nA bonus of Hart's high-intensity routine is that it taps into his naturally competitive spirit, making the workouts fun and motivating.\n\n\"It keeps the gamification a part of how we train at a very, very high level,\" Everline said.\n\nFinding ways to push yourself, and have a good time doing it, is the key to sticking with a workout long enough to see results. But when it comes to getting motivated, there's no one-size-fits-all, according to Everline.\n\n\"It's really finding a formula that fits you, taking it day-by-day, and not trying to have all the answers at once,\" he said. \"That's what longevity is built on. It's the compound effect of doing small things over a period of time.\"",

    "description": "Jonathan Gray also said he sees a key difference between the dot-com bubble and AI bubble.",
    "fullText": "Sometimes, a little stress at work is a good thing — especially if you're responsible for millions of other people's dollars.\n\nBlackstone's president and COO, Jon Gray, said that all of the current talk about market bubbles might actually make investors better at their jobs.\n\n\"One of the good things, I think, about the current environment, is that there's so much negativity,\" Gray said on an episode of Morgan Stanley's \"Hard Lessons\" podcast. \"There's a bubble in private credit, there's a bubble in AI, there's a bubble in the stock market. In some ways, that sort of caution that lingers over everything is helpful to stop things from getting out of hand.\"\n\nBig Tech companies are pouring billions into AI, sparking concerns that the massive investments won't ever pay off. The private credit market has seen enormous growth over the past few years, and some notable defaults, including those from auto parts supplier First Brands, have sparked fears of hidden risks.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Gray doesn't think there's a clean parallel between the markets of the dot-com era and now, at least not yet — Cisco, one of the largest companies in 2000, was trading much more aspirationally than Nvidia is today, reflecting more optimistic assumptions about future growth. (At its peak, Cisco was trading at more than 100 times its earnings, compared to Nvidia trading at around 43 times its earnings today).\n\n\"Now if this runs for five more years and people think trees grow to the skies, that's always a risk,\" Gray said of the AI hype.\n\nGray joined Blackstone, the private-markets giant managing $1.3 trillion in assets, in 1992. He started in what was then its nascent real estate business and helped it grow into one of the world's largest property investors.\n\n\"When you buy everything, and it goes up, it doesn't really train you to be a great investor,\" he said.\n\nIn the late 1990s, he bought a building in California and failed to recognize the shoddiness of the investment. It was, Gray said, the first time one of his deals had lost money, partly because he was blinded by his recent success and \"the mania of crowds.\"\n\nThe experience taught him not to simply double down on strategies that are working and assume they'll always work.\n\nBlackstone's acquisition of Hilton Hotels in 2007, which became one of private equity's most successful real estate deals despite a write-down of more than 70% at one point during the financial crisis, changed how Gray viewed investing. He said he learned to focus on the \"neighborhood\" of his investment, more than the minutiae of dollar amounts. That neighborhood can encompass underlying tailwinds, the quality of the business, and the management team.\n\n\"If you can get those things right, even if you made a really poorly timed investment and paid a big premium, it can still turn out OK,\" he said.",

    "description": "Photos show how crews prepare Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta for NFL game day in just 18 hours.",
    "fullText": "To prepare the field for an NFL game in less than 18 hours, crews have to strip and repaint the field, clean 2 million square feet of stadium space, and fire up thousands of meals in crowded kitchens, all in a matter of hours.\n\nThe first step in clearing the field and prepping for it to be painted with the Falcons' logo is collecting roughly 5 million pieces of confetti launched from confetti cannons.\n\nCleanup crews use rakes, leaf blowers, and utility vehicles fitted with large nets to collect every last piece — even the smallest piece of debris can interfere with repainting the turf.\n\nThe paint removal process takes around one to two hours to complete.\n\nTo speed things up, P-Rex machines spray a cleaning solution onto painted logos and use spinning brushes and a vacuum to remove the paint.\n\nThe process is surprisingly precise. Too many chemicals can soak the turf, and too much pressure can permanently damage the field.\n\nEvery area has to be cleared of waste, including the private suites, locker rooms, kitchens, and stadium bowl seating.\n\nIn the seating bowl, workers hand-pick everything from aluminum cans and plastic bottles to food containers and pom-poms, with each person assigned a specific type of waste to speed up sorting.\n\nAfter trash is collected from the stands, power-washing crews race behind the waste-collecting crews, scrubbing away spills and sticky residue before the next crowd arrives.\n\nEven though waste is pre-sorted, each bag still has to be inspected.\n\nThe goal: recycle or compost 96% of all waste generated during the event.\n\nOnce paint is removed from the field, the turf must completely dry before repainting can begin.\n\nGrounds crews use this small window of time to prep stencils and get ready to tackle the \"hot areas\" of the field — the center logo and the end zones — which are the most time-consuming.\n\nThe logo is hand-painted using spraying machines that ensure accuracy.\n\nCrews have to pay special attention to the sidelines and end zones to ensure everything is up to code before kickoff.\n\nAbout 100 cooks prepare different menus for concessions, suites, catering, and eight all-inclusive clubs — some serving up to 1,000 people.\n\nAt this game, the stadium's food team sold more than 25,000 hot dogs, 10,000 slices of pizza, and over 5,000 pounds of wings.\n\nThe menu changes for every event, and food is largely prepared in a central kitchen and distributed to multiple secondary kitchens throughout the stadium.\n\nExecutive chef Matt Cooper told Business Insider that having detailed boards allows him to keep track of his massive team and ensure everything runs smoothly.\n\n\"This is the magic behind everything we do,\" he said. \"We have all the chefs, all the supervisors, junior sous chefs, all the cooks, and we're able to kind of move the pieces around. It's a big kitchen, a lot of space, and I love being able to kind of visualize and see the whole team.\"\n\nAt the same time, club spaces are stocked with fruit and sandwich trays, employees place fan giveaway items on every seat inside the stadium, and excitement builds for kickoff.\n\nLights flash, cameras roll, fans cheer, and players take the field, with most of the stadium's attendees oblivious to the overnight operation that made it all happen.\n\nWhen the final whistle blows, it's mere hours before employees at Mercedes-Benz Stadium start planning for the next event.",

    "title": "I'm a Canadian startup founder. Y Combinator's initial decision to shut out Canadian startups was totally justifiable.",
    "description": "Hassan Ismail cofounded a defense tech startup in Canada. He found the country's regulations difficult to navigate, and the investors too risk-averse.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Hassan Ismail, the 24-year-old cofounder of Yellowcake, who lives in Toronto. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIn 2021, there was a government bid in Canada for some military hardware. My cofounder and I officially founded West Tek Defense Corporation in August 2022. We were doing smart rifles for the military.\n\nIt was complicated. (At one point, we were literally balancing redox equations for propellant in the ammo.) The physics background we both had helped a lot; essentially, everything we saw was something we'd encountered in a class or during personal research.\n\nWe spent about three years on the entire process. Ultimately, we found out it wasn't going to work — mostly because of regulation.\n\nWe spoke to the head of the civilian side of procurement for the bid, and we were flat-out told something like: \"There's no reason for us to consider you. We don't even care.\" For us to even find the contact for who was running the bid, it was a bunch of dead links. We had to go pester extremely high officials to get us the appropriate contact.\n\nTo be able to produce firearms in America, you need an FFL. You go through a pretty standard process: apply, background check, reason.\n\nIn Canada, the equivalent of an FFL is a BFL. We weren't able to get a BFL until we had a contract. We had to convince some type of agency, as two kids, to buy an idea. Almost all of them at first would be receptive: \"Sure, can we see this thing?\" We'd have to awkwardly explain to them: \"Well, you have to order them before I can even produce them, because of government regulation.\"\n\nJustifiably, most of them were like, \"Nope.\"\n\nWe took this terrible 3D-printed demo to the law enforcement in Northwest Ontario. It was falling apart. I could tell they pitied us.\n\nIt was regulatory law after regulatory law. After a while, we did finally get our BFL.\n\nIt turns out, if you want to subcontract this — which you will if you're a startup, because the startup doesn't have millions to start some manufacturing project — whoever you subcontract to needs their own BFL.\n\nIt really seemed that it was tailored against any kind of startup or disruptor to come in and break the status quo.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was that a lot of manufacturing businesses are going under here. Every time we'd reach out to a company, they'd either say they don't have the budget to help us, or they would and then would call us back later and say something to the effect of, \"We're going bankrupt.\"\n\nInvestors would say: Until you guys lock in these contracts, this $1 billion government bid, we're not going to touch it. These guys were looking for fourth- or fifth-time founders who already had multi-hundred-million-dollar exits.\n\nOne of our angels, who was the first money in, is on the board of a Big Tech company. He wrote us a $50,000 angel check. We'd pitch investors on that — and Canadian investors wouldn't care.\n\nAmerican investors were interested, but the issue was that they were interested in American defense, not really Canadian defense. They also had a lot of compliance issues with investing in foreign defense.\n\nWe ended up shuttering that. We still have the patents. The tech is still ready to go.\n\nWe got into the University of Waterloo's accelerator and started a new SaaS startup.\n\nThis startup is a Delaware C Corp. American investors — who rightfully want to invest in American companies, because it's what they're familiar with — are far more friendly and open-minded.\n\nMany Canadian investors have very hostile agreement conditions. One investor wanted to do CA$100,00 at a $3-5 million valuation. For reference, we ended up raising our round at $1.6 million at a $10 million post-money capitalization in America. They were offering less than a fraction. It's brutal.\n\nEveryone in our cap table is American, or Canadian expats living in America. None of our investors are actually living in Canada.\n\nWe'd like to move the business to New York. We think it is going to be the next tech hub. Clay CEO Kareem Amin is a McGill grad. He's Canadian. He also lets us co-work in his office in Chelsea.\n\nYC initially deciding not to invest in Canadian corporations is totally justifiable. There are a lot of Canadian founders in YC. What that's telling them is: Canadians aren't even confidant in building Canadian companies. They're all moving to America anyway.\n\nI understand their decision to reverse it. The backlash was coming from a place of political climate and ignorance. A lot of people were seeing it as YC sticking the middle finger to Canada.\n\nEveryone that we know, as well as Canadian YC founders that we know and love, have all said the same thing: This is a stupid debacle.\n\nWe all understand why YC did it.",

    "description": "Nevada and Las Vegas' luxury market is booming thanks to an influx of billionaires fleeing California's proposed Billionaire Tax Act.",
    "fullText": "The most expensive condo sale in the Las Vegas area closed in early January for $21 million. If the sale of the 5,000-square-foot penthouse about 15 miles from the Las Vegas Strip had closed just a little more than a week earlier, it potentially could have saved the buyer a few hundred million dollars.\n\n\"He was looking for a while, and at the last minute, there was a little bit of a hiccup,\" real estate agent Ivan Sher told Business Insider of the sale. \"He was actually even under contract significantly before then.\"\n\nThat \"he\" is billionaire Don Hankey, the chairman of Hankey Group and a lifelong Californian worth a reported $8.2 billion.\n\nHankey is one of a handful of Californians who have decided leave the state due to the proposed Billionaire Tax Act — a bill that would subject California residents worth more than $1 billion to a one-time tax worth 5% of their assets. For someone like Hankey, that's about $410 million.\n\n\"I just felt a little bit like I wasn't wanted,\" Hankey told Forbes of why he chose to leave California.\n\nWhile Hankey may still be on the hook for the billionaire tax — the bill will be on the ballot in November 2026 and would retroactively tax individuals who were living in California on January 1, 2026 if passed — Nevada has welcomed Hankey and other high-net-worth individuals with open arms.\n\nFor the ultrawealthy ready to ditch California, but not the West Coast, Nevada offers a happy medium. With tax perks similar to Florida's — no income tax and low property taxes — Nevada is slowly becoming the next nerve center for the rich.\n\nSher, who repped Hankey's $21 million penthouse sale on both sides as the founder of real estate agency IS Luxury, said that while Las Vegas' luxury market was already heating up, the news out of California kicked it into a higher gear.\n\n\"If people were to ask me what percentage of my buyers were from California, I'd say probably about 25%, and then for the first few years after COVID, that number was closer to 80%,\" Sher said. \"As soon as that billionaire tax was proposed, the exodus began again — but at a much higher level.\"\n\nThe Las Vegas metropolitan area had about 331 millionaire households in 2019, according to RentCafe data. In 2023, that number jumped 166% to 879 households.\n\nNatalia Harris has been selling ultra-luxury real estate in the Las Vegas area for the last five years. In that time, she said the definition of \"ultra-luxury\" has changed in the Silver State.\n\n\"Back then, a home that was $10 million was 'Wow' for Vegas — that was at the top of the price point,\" Harris told Business Insider. \"Now we have three new listings that we just brought to market last week that are all between $11 million and $20 million.\"\n\nZain Aziz, the founder of technology firm Atom and one of Harris' high-net-worth clients, moved to the Las Vegas suburb of Henderson, Nevada, in 2025. He said leaving the high taxes and hectic lifestyle of Silicon Valley behind was bittersweet.\n\n\"You don't really want to get punished if you do good and you create more jobs,\" Aziz said. \"I believe the Las Vegas Valley has become more and more what's synonymous with what California used to be — which was free-spirited and 'Come and achieve the impossible,'\" he added.\n\nAziz isn't the only one taking his assets elsewhere. Google cofounder Sergey Brin recently spent $42 million on a Lake Tahoe home on the Nevada side, according to Bloomberg. Larry Page, Google's other cofounder, found a tax haven on the East Coast, buying two properties totaling about $173 million in South Florida.\n\nBillionaire Larry Ellison, who owns homes across the country and the world, bought a handful of properties in Lake Tahoe near the California-Nevada border. He also recently sold his San Francisco home for $45 million in the largest sale in the area in 2025, according to the San Francisco Standard.\n\nAziz, who also moved his business to Nevada, said the culture that built California giants like Oracle and Google no longer exists there — it's budding in the next state over.\n\n\"There's no longer that innovative culture, and I believe where it exists is Vegas,\" Aziz said. \"I think that a lot of people from California who are chasing that are going to move to Vegas primarily because of the proximity to California.\"\n\nFor lifelong Californians not fully ready to leave the state's sunny weather and stellar beaches behind, Las Vegas is a less than two-hour flight to Los Angeles or San Francisco.\n\nIt also helps that certain areas of Nevada can offer a taste of home. Harris described the MacDonald Highlands neighborhood of Las Vegas, which is about 15 minutes from the Las Vegas Strip, as the Hollywood Hills of Vegas, offering stunning mountain views that give way to a sparkling cityscape beneath.\n\nFor Aziz, the developments in Nevada represent promise.\n\n\"This will become the hub for the wealthiest,\" he said. \"The city wants that.\"",

    "fullText": "For the last six months of my grandfather's life, my mornings had a rhythm: wake up, check on Papa, get him coffee, and make sure he took his medicine. After my grandmother died in September 2024, it was just my Papa and me in the house where I grew up. That's when I truly stepped into the caregiver role.\n\nWhen he passed in December 2025, the schedule that had governed my days vanished. I kept listening for him to call my name, needing something. The silence felt wrong.\n\nNow, weeks after his funeral, I'm realizing that I don't know who I am anymore.\n\nI was Papa's granddaughter who stayed close to home. I stopped making plans or going on trips. I built my life around being here. I didn't resent it; I loved him, and I was honored to be there. But now that he's gone, I don't know how to be anything else.\n\nI moved back home in July 2022 after a job opportunity brought me back to Chicago. My grandparents were excited. I was the oldest grandchild, the only girl, and — I liked to joke — their favorite.\n\nWithin two years of moving back, I lost my grandmother to lung cancer, and my Papa was diagnosed with prostate and bladder cancer. After a short hospital stay in July 2025, he decided against treatment. By November, he was in hospice. That's when everything changed.\n\nI don't love calling myself a \"caregiver,\" because that word feels clinical. I was his granddaughter who loved him. After my Nana died, being there for Papa felt like a badge of honor. I was carrying on her work, caring for the man she'd been married to for 56 years.\n\nI made sure he ate. I helped him get dressed. He was a prideful man who never wanted to ask for help, but in those final months, he had to. I was honored to be the person he could lean on.\n\nMy family also helped: My younger brother moved in for the last few months, and my mom was there every day. But the day-to-day care was mostly me.\n\nI stopped going out. I was terrified of not being here if he needed me. My job let me work from home, which I'm forever grateful for.\n\nThe ironic thing? Papa kept pushing me to leave. He wanted me to live my life. He was so proud of me. He loved it when I was happy.\n\nNow that he's gone, I can't seem to give myself permission to do what he wanted for me.\n\nI've set goals this year: to travel more, rebuild my social life, and live on my own again.\n\nBut every time I start planning something, a voice in my head stops me: \"How dare you. How can you want to move forward when you just lost someone you talked to every day?\"\n\nFriends and family keep telling me I need to get out of the house, but I feel like I'm supposed to keep grieving harder. There's a fear I can't quite name. This house has been my safe space, and wanting something different now feels complicated.\n\nI know that's not what Papa would want — but the guilt is real.\n\nLooking back, I wish I'd known that caring for someone you love doesn't mean erasing yourself. I should have set small boundaries, like saying yes to more weekend trips, keeping one activity for myself, or asking my family for more help. Those things wouldn't have made me love Papa less. They might have actually helped me show up better for him.\n\nI wish someone had told me that the \"after\" would be this complicated — that an identity crisis comes when the purpose that structured your days disappears.\n\nI know what Papa would say. He'd tell me to get out and go. He'd say this house would always be my home, but I didn't need to stay. He'd push me to find joy, to celebrate, to live.\n\nI just wish I could figure out how to thank him by actually doing what he wanted. I just need to keep telling myself that moving forward isn't betrayal. It's honoring everything he wanted for me.",

I enrolled in law school, eager to work hard and prove myself.\n\nThe city would eventually demand everything from me, relentlessly, until my life was no longer about ambition but survival.\n\nI eventually left New York City two years later, learning a lot about ambition and the true cost of the American dream.\n\nI was born and raised in Mexico City. It was the only home I'd ever known, which made leaving both harder and more necessary than I expected.

My days were rich with spontaneity. My nights felt endless in the best way.\n\nGrowing up there also meant learning to coexist with things that slowly wear you down. News alerts about violence became routine. Conversations casually referenced kidnappings the way others might discuss traffic. Certain neighborhoods, roads, or situations were simply off-limits. Everyone knew it, and no one questioned it.\n\nOver time, crime made my future feel fragile. When you're born somewhere, you learn to accept these things as normal. But that doesn't mean they don't accumulate. I didn't want to build a life that depended on constantly calculating risk.\n\nAt the same time, I felt pulled toward something else entirely. The American dream may be bruised and unevenly distributed, but it still exerts a gravitational force. New York represented access to industries, ambition, and reinvention. I wanted to test myself somewhere the ceiling felt higher, even if the floor was harder.\n\nI moved to Manhattan at the end of 2020. Despite the pandemic, my experience wasn't diminished. I watched the city come back to life at full speed.\n\nNew York was exactly as advertised: expensive, intense, chaotic, and unapologetically demanding. It rewarded momentum and punished hesitation. Everything required effort: finding housing, building community, maintaining balance.\n\nAt first, I embraced the intensity. I worked constantly, studied late into the night, stayed busy, and told myself exhaustion was proof I was doing something right. But New York normalizes extremes. Long hours become the baseline. Hustle becomes identity. Rest starts to feel indulgent.\n\nWhat made New York thrilling in the short term felt unsustainable when I imagined it as permanent. The social life, the hustle culture, the constant stimulation — all of it left little room for pause.\n\nStaying long-term meant accepting a life where I had to keep my foot on the gas pedal.\n\nNew York forced me to confront my relationship with ambition, productivity, and self-worth. It taught me discipline and precision. It also clarified my limits. I learned that opportunity without sustainability eventually becomes a trap, not a privilege.\n\nI understood exactly what the city offered: access, intensity, momentum. I also understood exactly what New York and the American dream demanded in return: everything.\n\nI knew then I didn't want to build a life that required me to be \"on\" constantly. I started prioritizing myself and my core convictions, love, relationships, and sustainability. That change would eventually take me out of New York City and into another global hub: London.",

    "description": "Teyana Taylor has been wearing eye-catching red-carpet looks for years, favoring bold cutouts and daring fabrics.",
    "fullText": "Taylor walked the AMAs red carpet in a black Steven Khalil gown.\n\nThe corset bodice was covered in black lace and had off-the-shoulder sleeves. Panels of sheer fabric adorned with lace and sparkles sat atop the form-fitting skirt, and it spilled into a gentle train.\n\nShe paired the dress with slicked-back hair, adding an edge to the glamorous look.\n\nA month later, Taylor stepped out at VH1's Divas Holiday: Unsilent Night event in a figure-hugging green gown.\n\nThe dress had one long sleeve, a delicate train, and a brooch on one shoulder.\n\nTaylor made her Met Gala debut in September 2021 at the \"In America: A Lexicon of Fashion\" event, wearing a Prabal Gurung ensemble.\n\nThe silver look, inspired by the Venus de Milo sculpture, featured a bikini-style top with crisscrossing fabric, and a low-waisted skirt with a thigh-high slit that flowed into a dramatic train trailing behind her. Swarovski crystals adorned the straps of the look, which Taylor paired with strappy heels and a headpiece.\n\nDramatic and daring, the look was a great choice for Taylor's first Met Gala.\n\nTaylor walked the red carpet in a black gown designed by Mônot. The strapless dress had a corset bodice with sheer paneling, while the Grecian-style skirt had a thigh-high slit.\n\nShe paired the dress with black gloves and strappy heels that curled around her ankles in thick straps. Black sunglasses with a beaded chain, a choker, and a chin cuff added drama to the ensemble.\n\nTaylor turned heads again at the \"Karl Lagerfeld: A Line of Beauty\" Met Gala in a tweed set designed by Thom Browne.\n\nHer bodysuit top was designed to look like a suit, complete with double-breasted buttons, a collar, and a tie, and the shoulders had exposed stitching.\n\nThe low-waisted, column skirt featured the same stitching on the seams, and a train trailed behind her. Taylor wore a birdcage veil and aviator sunglasses with the ensemble.\n\nTaylor's black set from Mônot looked like a dress ripped in half.\n\nThe high-neck top had an asymmetrical hem that cropped just below her bust, while the floor-length column skirt's waistline mirrored the top's curved hem.\n\nHer long sleeves, which turned into gloves, had holes inside her elbows, maintaining the garment's ripped look, which Taylor paired with stud earrings and a statement lip ring.\n\nFor the \"Garden of Time\" Met Gala, Taylor arrived in a floral-adorned gown designed by The Blonds.\n\nThe strapless neckline pointed into a V, and three-dimensional, floral appliqué adorned the corset bodice. Layered ruching sat on Taylor's hips, as did more floral adornments, before the skirt transitioned to a column style that exposed Taylor's legs thanks to a dramatic slit.\n\nTaylor paired the dress with gold heels and jewelry, as well as a blond wig that may have been a fun nod to her gown's designer.\n\nLaQuan Smith designed Taylor's suit, which featured a cropped tuxedo jacket and wide-legged pants that belted at her waist with a cummerbund.\n\nHer sheer blouse was the star of her look, with a polka-dot pattern and a dramatic ribbon at the neck. She wore the top unbuttoned, adding a daring touch to the look.\n\nTaylor brought a pop of color to the outfit with a gold headpiece and heels.\n\nTaylor tapped LaQuan Smith again for the Vanity Fair party, wearing a dress made almost entirely of sheer, red fabric.\n\nThe crewneck, long-sleeve gown was see-through, with a leotard-style bodice featuring cutouts at the waist. The tiered skirt was slightly less sheer and featured ruffled detailing.\n\nA gold choker made the look pop.\n\nTaylor was a livestream host for the \"Superfine: Tailoring Black Style\" Met Gala, and the outfit she arrived in epitomized the Black dandyism style the event celebrated.\n\nCustom-designed by Marc Jacobs, Taylor wore a gray, pinstripe suit with a long jacket and pants that cinched at the ankles. She wore a red vest under the suit, which coordinated with her dramatic, floor-length cape adorned with \"Harlem Rose,\" a feathered hat, and red shoes.\n\nMultiple accessories added to the look, like an oversize flower on the lapel, brooches, a necklace, and multiple waist chains.\n\nTaylor attended the screening in a Helen Taylor suit from the designer's spring 2025 collection.\n\nThe neckline cut all the way to Taylor's waist, where it cinched with a bow. Her tailored pants flared at the leg, and she wore a loose tie around her neck.\n\nA floor-length coat in the same brown-checked pattern completed the sophisticated, sexy look.\n\nTaylor promoted the Hulu series in a gold Schiaparelli gown.\n\nThe floor-length dress had a halter neckline, and its bodice cut dramatically inward to reveal much of her torso. Rips adorned the dress, revealing both Taylor's skin and sparkly, silver fabric on the inside of the gown.\n\nA slit revealed Taylor's silver boots, which matched the fabric of the rips.\n\nTo celebrate being named to the Time100 Next list, Taylor wore a black Tom Ford by Haider Ackermann look.\n\nThe base was a sheer, black gown. It had a halter neckline, while the bodice was just a thin strip of fabric that ran down the center of her chest before flowing into a mermaid skirt.\n\nShe wore a blazer over the dress, with pocket-square detailing and white cuffs to create the illusion of a shirt beneath. The jacket added a professional flair to the look.\n\nThe silver, strapless dress, designed by Miss Sohee Couture, was sculpted to Taylor's body. A pattern of square, sparkly adornments covered the entire gown, sparkling as she walked the red carpet.\n\nShe wore Chopard jewelry with the gown.\n\nDesigned by Balmain, the neckline of the bodice plunged all the way to Taylor's waist, while the back of the hooded dress was open.\n\nThe form-fitting skirt was belted below her waist, and a slit cut up the center to reveal her strappy gold heels.\n\nThe gold look, which was modern and daring, is one of Taylor's most memorable fashion moments to date.\n\nTaylor chose a black Nicholas Oakwell Couture dress for the Critics Choice Association Celebration of Black Cinema & Television.\n\nThe strapless, bustier bodice was covered in black, sheer lace. A wrap dress adorned with white flowers sat on top, with a one-shoulder strap that cut across her bodice. The dress ruched at the waist, and it swathed across her legs asymmetrically into a train.\n\nLong tassels trimmed the dress, bringing dimension to the look. Pointed-toe heels with floral detailing, designed by Alexandre Birman, coordinated with the look.\n\nMiss Sohee Couture designed Taylor's black ball gown.\n\nThe bodice of the gown was sheer and featured an off-the-shoulder, sweetheart neckline. The ball gown skirt was made of a latex-like material, and it bubbled around her waist for dramatic volume.\n\nAndrea Wazen designed her black shoes.\n\nTaylor won her Golden Globe for \"One Battle After Another\" at the event in a custom Schiaparelli look.\n\nHer black dress had a high neckline, with a dramatic cutout across the bodice. The back was open, revealing a bedazzled thong, while the skirt flowed to the floor with a separate train trailing behind Taylor.\n\nDiamond jewelry tied it all together.\n\nTaylor's sheer black dress was designed by Ashi Studio, with long sleeves and an ultra-high neckline that covered her mouth and nose.\n\nThe knee-length skirt poofed dramatically at Taylor's heels, forming a heart shape. Her sheer tights coordinated with the dress, as did her Aquazzura shoes.\n\nDiamond rings made the chic look pop.\n\nNominated for best R&B album, Taylor wore a custom Tom Ford by Haider Ackermann dress to the 2026 Grammys.\n\nThe sparkly dress had a form-fitting skirt with a small train, while the bodice had a keyhole back and daring cutouts on the side and center. The fabric wrapped diagonally across her body, leaving much of her torso exposed.\n\nTiffany & Co. jewelry, including a statement necklace, completed the look.",

    "title": "12 of Bad Bunny's best and worst looks throughout his career",
    "description": "From bold red carpets to headline-making performances, take a look at Bad Bunny's best and worst fashion moments over the years.",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny is headlining the Super Bowl Halftime Show on Sunday, and fans are eager to see how his outfit might play a role in the production.\n\nSince his 2016 debut, Bad Bunny has established himself as a fearless fashion icon, often talking about how central his style is to who he is in songs like \"Yo Visto Así,\" where he sings, \"I wear what I want, I won't change / If you don't like it, you don't have to look.\"\n\nWhile the singer's unapologetic fashion style has been one of the many things that's helped him become a worldwide superstar, his fashion evolution tells a story of experimentation … and the unavoidable mistakes that come with it.\n\nAs we prepare to see the singer take the stage at the Super Bowl this Sunday, take a look back at some of his most iconic looks through the years, starting with his best.\n\nHis third Met Gala appearance — and first serving as a co-chair for the event — was among the best and most acclaimed.\n\nThe singer wore a custom Maison Margiela Artisanal suit designed by John Galliano that stood out for its theatrical flair.\n\nIt included a navy suit with white stitching detail, a dark floral fabric bouquet, and a surreal sculptural hat that reflected the fashion house's avant-garde style. The outfit also included leather gloves, geometric sunglasses, and a horse-like pair of Margiela's signature Tabi shoes.\n\nThe look was commended as one of the night's best and cemented the singer's growing presence as a menswear icon.\n\nDuring his headlining set at Coachella in 2023, the singer wore a maximalist custom ERL patchwork puffer jacket and matching pants. The outfit was full of overly saturated, busy patterns that included florals, stripes, and plaid.\n\nThe eccentric and colorful look matched the show's stadium-level production and high-energy setlist as he performed songs from his 2022 summer album, \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\"\n\nAt the 2023 Met Gala, Bad Bunny wore a custom all-white Jacquemus suit with a cutout back and a dangling \"J\" as a nod to the look's designer. It also featured a dramatic, 26-foot-long rosette cape.\n\nThe outfit was spot-on for the event, which honored the late Karl Lagerfeld, and broke away from traditional menswear choices, becoming one of the most talked-about looks of the night.\n\nFor his debut at the Grammy Awards, Bad Bunny went for an outfit that was playful without feeling gimmicky.\n\nThe singer wore an all-black Burberry look, which he paired with a hat resembling bunny ears and tinted sunglasses.\n\nIn contrast to the simple, monochromatic outfit, he carried a bright sunflower, which added to the look's playfulness and served as a nod to the more colorful, adventurous fashion choices he'd become known for.\n\nAlthough simple, the sunflower detail was one of the most talked-about accessories of the night. \"Bad Bunny's fully bloomed sunflower has managed to make my heart swell,\" wrote Vogue's Liana Satenstein.\n\nIf we go back in Bad Bunny style history, there are certain moments that stand out … and not in a good way. His floral Gucci suit at the 2017 Latin American Music Awards is one of them.\n\nThe then-up-and-coming artist wore a loud floral suit, paired with bedazzled, tinted sunglasses and excessive diamond jewelry, including grills and layered necklaces. The suit also had embroidered details on the lapel, which were accentuated by flower details, and diamond buttons.\n\nWhile the singer — who had a buzzcut back then — might look almost unrecognizable in this look, it signaled his strong sense of style right at the beginning of his career.\n\nBut does that make it a good look? Well …\n\nAnother early look from the Puerto Rican singer shared some of the same qualities: It was a bright, unique look.\n\nBad Bunny wore a shiny purple suit with metallic fabrics, embroidered details, and gems along the lapel edges. He wore it with an equally shiny metallic shirt underneath, a large diamond cross necklace, and lilac sunglasses.\n\nWhile it was certainly a daring look, there was just too much going on, unlike the more pared-down, chic looks he would later wear.\n\nWhile Bad Bunny's performance with Marc Anthony and Will Smith at the 19th annual Latin Grammy Awards brought energy to the night, fashion-wise, it was a bit confusing.\n\nWhile Anthony stuck with his classic black-and-white suit, Smith opted for a sparkly black jacket and shirt for the stage. Bad Bunny, on the other hand, chose an outfit that was more of a reflection of the times' quickly fading trends, worn all at once.\n\nHe wore silver pleather pants, a zebra-print shirt, and a burgundy velvet bomber jacket, along with pink sunglasses, for the performance.\n\nOnstage, the look felt out of place with his collaborators' style choices. It also probably started looking dated about 15 minutes after the performance ended.\n\nThe singer wore a loud Louis Vuitton matching outfit at his 2019 Coachella performance, pairing the oversized ensemble with visor-style lenses that covered most of his face.\n\nThe outfit was covered in pastel rainbow logos, leaving little room for mistaking the look for another designer's.\n\nTo accept the award for best urban music album at the Latin Grammys for his debut album \"X 100Pre,\" Bad Bunny wore a look that combined multiple patterns and color palettes.\n\nThe singer wore a mismatching short-sleeve button-down shirt and plaid shorts with a zip-up turtle-neck-like collar, a black bucket hat, dark sunglasses, and Gucci knee pads.\n\nThe outfit matched the singer's 2018 album title \"Yo Hago Lo Que Me Da La Gana,\" which translates to \"I do whatever I want.\"",

    "description": "To try \"going analog\" and getting off of our phones, we started a new hobby: adult paint-by-numbers. It's been great for us and our relationship.",
    "fullText": "I'm stuck in a doomscrolling loop again.\n\nMy algorithm drags me down the rabbit hole of videos people posted to social media to declare 2026 as the year they … get off social media.\n\nI see more and more videos with mass declarations to \"go analog\" and focus on screen-free activites. The irony is thick, but with the world on fire around me the sentiment has appeal.\n\nI'm not naive enough to think this movement is new or will last in any meaningful way, but participating seems like a nice way to take a breath and find some good in the rubble.\n\nAs I watch another video and then one more, an idea starts to take root. What if I start a new hobby to get off my phone, even if just for a little while each day?\n\nAnd what if my husband joins me?\n\nWhen I share this idea with my husband, he brings up the idea of buying paint-by-number kits that are designed for adults.\n\nIt's far out of our comfort zone. But before either of us have a chance to talk ourselves out of this, we pop into an art store.\n\nWe both decide to buy larger canvases mostly to have a longer-term project, not because we are certain we have the right abilities. About $30 later, we're still wondering what we are thinking.\n\nWhen we get home, we bring down a folding table from our office. It's just the right height to share as we sit on our loveseat, water, brushes, and paper towels between us.\n\nKeeping our paints separated, we turn on reruns of \"New Girl,\" grab our reading glasses and glob the colors on our canvases — him a streetscape of Brooklyn, me a skyscape of London — both quietly hoping they'll be nice enough to hang on our bedroom wall when we're done.\n\nSeveral things soon become clear. First, we may have overestimated our abilities and how difficult an adult paint-by-number could be.\n\nNext, we are taking vastly different approaches to the task. I am starting with the larger areas, swirling my brush and not coming close to the canvas edge until the very last minute, desperate to not make a mistake.\n\nMy husband goes for the smaller details in the darkest color. He has read all the instructions. I've tossed mine straight into the recycle bin.\n\nOur personalities are similar until they aren't. I have a need to catastrophize before I build a plan. My husband is logical with a more black-and-white way of thinking. I feel these differences highlighted as we paint.\n\nOver the span of two or three episodes of \"New Girl,\" I've delayed starting, given up, and restarted a dozen times. My sky looks terrible, punctuating my lack of artistic talents.\n\nI declare total disaster in between every laugh, fret about running out of pink sky No. 12, and stop long before the last episode of the night comes to an end.\n\nStill, we continue painting night after night.\n\nThe progress is slow and neither of us are sure when we'll be done. But something happens on the nights we choose painting over retreating with phones in hands: Our home is kinder. We talk. We laugh.\n\nThe stress of getting the strokes within the lines is the lighter type of stress we used to have when our marriage was young.\n\nOn our way to bed, we stand up. Assess. Comment on our progress and sleep a little easier.\n\nWe're remembering what it's like to do something with no goal or agenda. We're enjoying our time together less online.\n\nMaybe when we're all done, I'll post a picture in a hazy filter and show off my pink-skyed London, mistakes on full display — a little analog badge to celebrating remembering how to live.",

    "fullText": "Sussex chairman Jon Filby has resigned in the wake of the county's financial difficulties which have left them facing points deductions for next season.\n\nFilby, Sussex chairman since 2022, leaves the role after the club – having reported sustained operating losses – were placed under tighter financial controls by the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), including a player salary cap for the next two years and docked points in all three competitions for 2026.\n\nSeveral former Sussex players, including ex-England wicketkeeper Matt Prior and ex-Pakistan spinner Mushtaq Ahmed, signed an open letter on Friday calling on the current board to stand down.\n\nFilby had been due to attend a members' forum at Hove on Monday alongside acting chief executive Mark West and head coach Paul Farbrace.\n\nHowever, West confirmed in a statement , externalthat vice-chairman Martin Richards was stepping up on an interim basis until the club's annual general meeting in March, and would attend in Filby's place.\n\n\"Jon has given a significant amount of time and energy to the club during a difficult period,\" said West. \"On behalf of Sussex Cricket, I would like to thank him for his service.\n\n\"I also want to respond directly to the open letter published this week and to the strength of feeling it reflects. We fully understand the emotions behind it.\n\n\"Poor financial performance has left the club in a position where we have had to seek support from the ECB and now face sporting sanctions.\n\n\"We know many former players, sponsors and members care deeply about Sussex Cricket, and we hear their concerns clearly. I can only apologise, on behalf of the club, for the position we are in.\n\n\"But I would ask everyone who cares about Sussex to allow us the opportunity to put things right. It will mean change, but it also requires stability, and we will be far stronger together.\"\n\nSussex could lose players over financial constraints\n\nRobinson to captain Sussex in County Championship",

This season so far, although I've had some good results, I feel that my overall consistency hasn't been as strong as the very best.\"\n\nHe made successive breaks of 130 and 145 in the sixth and seventh frames, but 34-year-old Zhang, chasing a second ranking title in his fourth final, knocked in four breaks of more than 50 as the first session was shared 4-4.\n\nZhao raised his level further in the evening session, scoring heavily to take three of the next four frames, opening a 7-5 lead with a break of 111.\n\nWorld number 23 Zhang was on for a maximum 147 break in the 13th frame after potting 10 reds and nine blacks, but he broke down on 73.\n\nZhao restored his two-frame advantage with a 134 break and hit 65 to move within one of victory before sealing the win and £180,000 winner's prize with a 131 clearance.\n\nIt proved a fitting finish to what has been a landmark tournament for Chinese snooker, producing the first all-Chinese semi-final line-up at a ranking event, while nine of the players in the last 16 in Hong Kong hailed from the host nation.",

There was no wild celebration. They had pulled it back from the brink.\n\nDespite all that has happened this winter, they came into this World Cup among the favourites having won 10 of their past 11 T20s.\n\nHad Curran not salvaged the victory, everything - McCullum's future in particular - would have come under the microscope again.\n\nThat is pushed back for another day. England must also be praised for not wilting where other England sides have before.\n\nCurran already appeared to have swung the momentum once.\n\nAfter Nepal reached 124-2, his slower ball stopped Dipendra Singh Airee on 44 as the right-hander was caught at deep over. Captain Rohit Paudel was dismissed by Dawson for 39 in the next over.\n\nBut England's experienced bowlers of Archer and Adil Rashid, who conceded 42 from three overs, struggled, leaving Curran to bowl at the last.\n\nHe did not concede a boundary in the final over, mixing his pace and bowling predominately full.\n\nHe was dropped by England before being recalled at the end of last summer but delivered when needed most.\n\nNepal's players completed a lap of honour in front of their deflated supporters at the end.\n\nThough they have been tipped to cause problems at this World Cup, having beaten West Indies over three matches last year and taken South Africa to the final ball at the 2024 World Cup, they have never beaten a major nation on the world stage.\n\nThey were excellent with the ball too - leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane the pick with 1-25, including the wicket of Tom Banton lbw for two.\n\nOff-spinner Sher Malla had Phil Salt caught off a top edge with his first ball in international cricket and Airee also took two wickets with his off-spin in a fine all-round performance.\n\nJacob Bethell made an entertaining 55 and Brook a well-placed 53 for England, but Nepal's batting was on a par as they swept and scurried.\n\nOn this evidence, and given they play all four matches in Mumbai, they have a real shot at progressing from this group.\n\nAn almighty scare - but are England learning?\n\nMinnows Nepal fall four runs short of shock win over England - as it happened\n\nMen's T20 World Cup 2026 - results & fixtures\n\nTMS podcast: England survive World Cup scare against Nepal",

    "description": "At least six people have been detained a week after a different demonstration in Turin turned violent.",
    "fullText": "Six people have been arrested after police clashed with protesters in Milan, one of the host cities of the Winter Olympic Games, during the first day of the competition.\n\nThousands took to the streets in the northern Italian city on Saturday to protest against the Games and a range of issues including the cost of living. Some released fireworks and threw stones at police, who responded with water cannon.\n\nIt comes after the government tightened protest laws in the wake of a demonstration last weekend in Turin that left more than 100 officers injured, according to government figures.\n\nMeanwhile, officials are investigating suspected sabotage on northern Italy's railway network on Saturday.\n\nPrime Minister Giorgia Meloni said those protesting against the Olympics were the \"enemy of Italy\" and had put images of the demonstrations \"on the televisions of half the world\", while thousands of other Italians were working hard to make the competition a success.\n\nShe said this had happened \"after others locked railway cables to prevent trains from starting\".\n\nDeputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini described those involved in confrontations in Milan as \"criminals\".\n\n\"Just days after the shameful violence in Turin, more clashes, more attacks on law enforcement,\" he said.\n\n\"We're proud to have pushed for a new security package that will allow for even more effective interventions against thugs and criminals.\"\n\nThe Turin demonstration, which was called in response to the eviction of an unofficial social centre, started peacefully but later turned violent when armed groups confronted police. More than 30 people were arrested.\n\nOne officer was attacked with a hammer, which Meloni described as attempted murder.\n\nA new security package, which was adopted on Thursday after being fast-tracked as a result of the violence in Turin, allows police to detain suspected troublemakers for up to 12 hours before demonstrations to stop them from spreading unrest. Critics have called it repressive.\n\nMost of those involved in Saturday's protest in Milan marched peacefully. One woman, Francesca Missana, told news agency AFP that the Olympic Games were \"no longer sustainable from an environmental or a social point of view, their time is up\".\n\n\"These Games were promoted as sustainable and cost-neutral,\" protest organiser Alberto di Monte told AFP. He added that because the Games were spread across multiple sites, and that billions had been spent on roads instead of protecting the mountains.\n\nSaturday also saw chaos on some of Italy's northern rail networks, with suspected attacks delaying people for hours.\n\nA fire hit rail infrastructure between Bologna and Venice, and police later found severed cables and an explosive device in locations nearby.\n\nPolice said a track switch was set alight near Pesaro on the Adriatic coast and electric cables were found severed near Bologna, along with a rudimentary explosive device left by a track.\n\nBologna's central rail station is a major hub, linking cities in the north and south, and east to west lines.\n\nRFI, which owns the country's railways, said services have since returned to normal.\n\nThe transport ministry described the incidents as \"suspected sabotage\" and said they mirrored vandalism at the start of the Paris Olympics in 2024.\n\n\"These actions of unprecedented seriousness do not in any way tarnish Italy's image in the world, an image that the Games will make even more compelling,\" Salvini, who is also Italy's transport minister, said on Saturday.\n\nThe Winter Olympics are taking place until 22 February in a number of locations, from Milan to the resort town of Cortina d'Ampezzo, the Dolomite regions of Predazzo and Tesero, and the Alpine resorts of Livigno and Bormio.",

    "fullText": "After eight matches and five days of competition at the Winter Olympics, Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds have finally been beaten in Cortina.\n\nIt was Switzerland who eventually did what Norway, Estonia, Czech Republic, Sweden, Korea, Canada and the United States couldn't in the curling mixed doubles in the Dolomites.\n\nTheir 7-5 victory will mean more to them than it would have to the Great Britain duo, as they pursue the semi-final spot that Mouat and Dodds have already clinched.\n\nHowever, the Scottish pair were eager to preserve their 100% record, both to further stamp their authority on the competition and to ensure they have the hammer - the right to throw last - in Monday's semi (18:05 GMT) and in whichever medal match they find themselves in on Tuesday.\n\nMouat and Dodds will have another chance to do both of those things when they conclude their round-robin matches against Italy at 18:05 - live on the BBC.\n\nWinter Olympics: GB in curling action, plus mixed biathlon medals - watch\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\n\"The energy will be electric so we're looking forward to that and hopefully causing some drama in the stands,\" Mouat told BBC Sport.\n\nTo do so, they will have to rediscover their best form against the hosts, whose every successful shot sends a cascade of noise rolling down the wooden bleachers of this quirky arena.\n\nThe Italians overwhelmed the Czech Republic at the same time as Switzerland were inflicting defeat on Team GB.\n\nThe married Yannick Schwaller and Briar Schwaller-Huerlimann started aggressively, stealing shots in both the second and third ends to establish a 4-0 advantage.\n\nMouat and Dodds righted themselves a little with two to go into the break at 4-2, then stole two to pull themselves level.\n\nThe Swiss nudged ahead again and, although GB took two to lead for the first time going into the final end, they were unable to prevent their opponents snatching a decisive two to close out victory.\n\n\"We put ourselves against the wall a bit,\" Dodds told BBC Sport. \"I had a couple of overthrows which put us in a lot of bother but we're still in a very good position.\"\n\nNorway's Johannes Hosflot Klaebo clinched the first of a potential six gold medals at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics in the 10km+10km skiathlon.\n\nIt takes the 29-year-old's career Olympic gold tally to six, just two behind the all-time winter record.\n\nThat is held by the Norwegian trio of biathlete Ole Einar Bjorndalen and cross country skiers Bjorn Daehlie and Marit Bjorgen, who are all retired.\n\nTeam GB's Andrew Musgrave came 10th in his fifth Games - just short of his best Olympic finish of seventh in 2018 - with fellow Briton Joe Davis 16th.\n\n\"I'm not going to lie, I'm a bit disappointed,\" Musgrave told BBC Sport after the race.\n\n\"I felt like it was so fast on the first section and straight away I was struggling - it was hot and I was overheating.\n\n\"My chances of a good finish were over after the first lap.\"\n\nMathis Desloges took silver after being spared punishment for cutting a corner on the course, earning France their first medal, with Norway's Martin Lowstrom Nyenget third.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "England wing Immanuel Feyi-Waboso has been ruled out of the match against Scotland next weekend and is in danger of missing the entire Six Nations.\n\nThe 23-year-old started all four of England's autumn Tests but suffered a hamstring injury in training last week and missed Saturday's 48-7 victory over Wales.\n\nHead coach Steve Borthwick recalled Henry Arundell for that game and he scored a hat-trick in the first half of what was England's championship opener.\n\nBorthwick is hoping for a positive update when Feyi-Waboso sees a specialist, but he will miss the Calcutta Cup game at Murrayfield and it appears doubtful the Exeter player will return in time to feature again in the Six Nations.\n\n\"It looks like Manny will be out for a number of weeks. I don't know how many, but it's a number rather than a single week, which is disappointing,\" Borthwick said.\n\n\"But that's unfortunately the nature of elite sport - there are injuries and then you have to adapt.\"\n\nThe Six Nations has been condensed this year, with five rounds of matches spanning just six weekends.\n\nThe championship ends with England's trip to face France in Paris on the evening of 14 March.\n\n'The shirt used to weigh heavy - now England players double in size in it'\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales",

    "description": "Why some subtle signs suggest, despite their scare against Nepal in the T20 World Cup, England might be learning under Harry Brook and Brendon McCullum.",
    "fullText": "England have a recent history of hair-raising starts to World Cups.\n\nThey were pummeled by New Zealand in Ahmedabad in 2023 and smashed around by Scotland at the last T20 World Cup until rain intervened.\n\nIn front of thousands of Nepalese fans at the famous Wankhede Stadium - the ground where England have produced statistically their worst 50-over bowling performance in history and suffered their heaviest T20 defeat - they were one boundary from defeat.\n\nThe impact of a loss to Nepal does not bear thinking about for an England team under the most intense pressure.\n\nThey did not do much wrong when their opponents were seemingly charging towards a seismic victory, with Nepal's inspired batting deserving of huge credit.\n\nBut the tightrope coach Brendon McCullum and captain Harry Brook are walking is so precarious after England's Ashes defeat and Brook's Wellington escapades, a defeat here may have sent them tumbling to new depths.\n\nThe walkie talkie McCullum was seen talking into during Nepal's chase could have become the equivalent of Ruben Amorim's tactics board in the rain during Manchester United's embarrassing Carabao Cup loss at fourth-tier Grimsby Town in August.\n\nInstead, it may be a hint at a coach who is able to change.\n\nReducing McCullum's coaching to its most recognisable image - feet up, sunglasses in place, watching motionless from a balcony somewhere in the world - would always be wrong.\n\nCarlo Ancelotti has won more Champions Leagues than Pep Guardiola, no matter how expressive he is or otherwise.\n\nBut McCullum is the coach who has always asked players to rely on instinct.\n\nHe has done most of his work in the background, leaving his players to make the calls in the middle.\n\nHere, he was sending suggestions to his players when the situation squeezed.\n\n\"That's something we've been doing recently - that dressing room to dugout communication,\" said all-rounder Will Jacks afterwards.\n\n\"It is so messages can get run out to the captain or to the guys who are batting in the middle.\n\n\"It's just an easier way of spreading the message.\"\n\nEngland's white-ball outfit appeared too stubborn in their first months under McCullum last year.\n\nWith a bowling attack of Brydon Carse, Jamie Overton, Mark Wood and Jofra Archer, they were thrashed by 150 runs in a T20 on this ground a year ago.\n\nThey arrived in India trying to attack with right-arm express pace and that continued through the Champions Trophy where they did not win a game.\n\nSam Curran will never have the pace of Wood nor the height of Overton, but against Nepal, in defending 10 from the final over, he justified his return from the wilderness.\n\nSome will say England were rescued by the man they discarded. You can also credit them for realising the mistake.\n\nBrook gave a hint at England locating their senses when he spoke to the media on Friday.\n\nHe recalled Liam Dawson - another crucial part of this win with his 2-21 aged 35 - in his first move as captain last year.\n\n\"You look at India's side, and they're one of the best sides to play T20 cricket at the minute, and they've got about five spinners,\" said Brook. \"If they're doing that, why don't we have a little bit of a crack at that as well?\"\n\nHe later backtracked, appearing to be wary of the implications of appearing to imitate India, but would it be so bad if England were?\n\nIt was a diversion from previous messaging of always concentrating on themselves.\n\nBrook would probably tell you it is those conversations - dealing with the media and finding the right words - that is the hardest part of captaincy.\n\nIf it was only about the what goes on a cut strip of 22 yards or the green grass around it, there would be no discussion over his future.\n\nOn the field, he has impressed as a young captain and here, not without frights, he came through his toughest test so far.\n\nEngland have often looked leaderless in the field during their sorry recent run at white-ball tournaments - a spell in which they have given up their T20 and 50-over world titles and exited the Champions Trophy without winning - but at the crunch moment here there was little doubt who was in charge.\n\nHe may not have played under him, but Brook referred to the Eoin Morgan book of captaincy by repeatedly holding the ball at the top of a bowler's mark, giving the heart-rate of his player time to settle.\n\nHe also led the conversation in the drinks break late in Nepal's chase, after which they lost two quick wickets.\n\n\"He was very good at keeping level headed,\" admitted Jacks.\n\n\"Jos [Buttler] spoke as well and those experienced guys are crucial when those pressure situations come around.\"\n\nOf course, the caveat remains that with one swing of the bat, one flash off an edge, the story would all have been different.\n\nNepal were hugely impressive, but are still 16th in the world rankings.\n\nTougher tests will come but England teams have crumbled in pressure moments while carrying far less baggage than this one.\n\nThere are just hints, that they may be learning.",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn has undergone surgery on a left-leg fracture after suffering heartbreak in what could be her final Olympic event as she crashed in the women's downhill competition in Cortina.\n\nThe 41-year-old was competing just nine days after rupturing ligaments in her left knee, but hitting the gate with her ski pole on a first jump left Vonn off balance, denying a fairytale ending to a remarkable story.\n\nVonn was airlifted off the piste to Ca Foncello hospital in Trevizo, around 130km from Olimpia delle Tofane in the Dolomites, following lengthy treatment.\n\nThe hospital issued a statement which said she had undergone \"orthopedic surgery to stabilize the fracture she sustained in her left leg\" - the same leg with the torn ACL.\n\nEarlier, a statement from the United States ski team said Vonn had \"sustained an injury\" but was in a \"stable condition\".\n\nThe two-time world champion had successfully completed two training runs on the iconic course prior to Sunday's crash.\n\nCompatriot Breezy Johnson was in tears as she added Olympic gold to the world title she won last year after clocking a blistering time of one minute 36.10 seconds.\n\nThe 30-year-old watched on the big screen at the finish line with her head in her hands when her team-mate crashed, having completed her run sixth, while Vonn was 13th to go.\n\nAnother American, Isabella Wright, watched the crash from the top of the slope before having to complete her own run, but said she had hoped Vonn would be able to complete the race despite the anterior cruciate ligament injury she sustained nine days ago.\n\n\"If anyone can, Lindsey can. Whatever it is, or whatever the situation, she's very strong. We're going to support her the best we can,\" she said.\n\n\"She deserved a better ending than that so I'm heartbroken for her. I hope to see her and just support her. I know she's in good hands right now. [I'm] anxiously waiting to see her.\"\n\nGermany's Emma Aicher was pipped by 0.04 seconds and took the silver medal, while Italian home favourite Sofia Goggia secured bronze.\n\nVonn was taking a huge risk by competing on Sunday having suffered the ACL injury in Switzerland in the last World Cup race before the Games, but was determined to take to the course for her favoured event.\n\nStunned spectators applauded towards the helicopter as it carried her away from the piste which has brought her so much success - with 12 of her 84 World Cup wins coming here.\n\nVonn had been unsure what her knee was capable of withstanding but had targeted the downhill - saying she would try no matter the outcome - while also being entered in the super-G and team events.\n\nIt is now unlikely she will compete in those, meaning her Olympic career has almost certainly come to a devastating end.\n\nVonn had appeared relaxed in the training runs and in the morning before the race. Her coach Aksel Lund Svindal said on Friday he felt confident she could pull off something spectacular.\n\nNo stranger to a comeback, Vonn retired from the sport in 2019 as the most decorated female skier at the time but had suffered several serious leg injuries.\n\nShe made a shock return to the sport in 2024 after a partial right knee replacement.\n\nVonn was tipped for the podium in Cortina, competing at her fifth Olympics following a successful 2025-26 season, in which she reached the podium in all five races, winning two.\n\nBut this latest crash leaves a significant doubt over whether Vonn will ski competitively again.\n\nJohnson, who has suffered serious leg injuries of her own, said Vonn's coach had told her she was cheering her team-mate on from the helicopter.\n\n\"The work that we put in, obviously my heart aches for her,\" Johnson said.\n\n\"It's a tough road and it's a tough sport - that's the beauty and the madness of it. It can hurt you so badly but you keep coming back for more.\"\n\nFollow day two of Winter Olympics\n\nKlaebo wins first of potential six golds at Games\n\nVonn knew the dangers of competing but showed defiance in a media conference earlier this week, and had even hit back at a doctor on social media who claimed the injury was \"not a fresh tear\".\n\nShe responded by saying her ACL is \"100% torn\" and had hoped to defy the odds by replicating the Olympic downhill gold medal she won in Vancouver in 2010.\n\nVideos on social media had shown her training in the gym after she said she had no pain or swelling of the knee, while two smooth runs in the build-up to the race had given her, and her team and fans, confidence.\n\nFour-time British Olympian Chemmy Alcott was emotional on BBC coverage and said she \"never believed\" it would end in this way.\n\n\"What we saw [is] that the top of the piste is really hard for a fit athlete. It is brutal - think about her family, her team and herself,\" she said.\n\n\"We have to be realistic - the risk was really high, the risk she takes when she falls will double that. Her body will not be able to take that.\"\n\nAlcott added that the long delay would also mean the snow on the piste would begin to melt in the midday sun, meaning any racer who followed Vonn would struggle to match Johnson's time.\n\nThe crash surely unsettled the rest of the field, too, and Andorra's Cande Moreno was also airlifted off the piste after crashing into a gate.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Olivia Smith's talent and versatility is helping to kick-start a drifting Arsenal side back into life as they chase silverware on three fronts.",
    "fullText": "When Arsenal made Olivia Smith the first £1m player player in the history of women's football, they did not think they were signing a striker.\n\nThe 21-year-old Canadian had earned a reputation as a busy right-sided winger, the kind that hugs the sideline and takes pleasure in turning full-backs inside out.\n\nThe fee raised eyebrows in some quarters - after all, Chloe Kelly had seemingly made the right flank spot her own during last season's triumphant Champions League campaign.\n\nWhat could Smith offer that she - or Beth Mead - could not? As simple as it seems, the answer may well be versatility.\n\nSmith played the unfamiliar role of number nine against runaway Women's Super League leaders Manchester City on Sunday, but looked right at home as she scored the only goal in a 1-0 win.\n\nWith three goals in her past four league games, Smith is one of the most in-form players in the WSL.\n\n\"I'll play wherever I need to be. I was running at the back line, stretching them, runs in behind and trying to get finishes on goal,\" Smith told Sky Sports.\n\nArsenal may only have thrown the smallest of spanners in City's title charge - they remain eight points clear of Manchester United with seven games remaining - but Smith's talent and versatility has helped to kick-start a drifting Gunners side back into life.\n\nArsenal exploited City's high defensive line - and lack of pace the back - by playing through passes either side of central defenders Rebecca Knaak and Jade Rose.\n\nSmith beat Knaak to a Mariona Caldentey pass before rounding Ayaka Yamashita and slotting into the empty net, but originally that job was not meant to be her's.\n\nStina Blackstenius picked up a calf issue during the week, forcing manager Renee Slegers to find an alternative solution.\n\n\"We have been successful with Stina [Blackstenius] in the nine, she is so good with her physicality and speed,\" said Slegers.\n\n\"She wasn't available, so we wanted similar qualities even though Olivia and Stina are very different players. Liv [Smith] had two-and-a-half training sessions in the nine position.\n\n\"[There was] a lot of meetings with coaches, giving her the details without putting too much information in her head so she could play on intuition, because that is when she is really good.\n\n\"She picked up the role brilliantly, the goal was exactly what we wanted.\"\n\nOf course, opponents rarely employ defensive lines against Arsenal as high as City did, but the Canada forward showed she can be relied upon.\n\n\"We have different options [for different opponents]. This was very specific for us today, Olivia hasn't done it for us before. But she performed really well, so of course we will see her as an option going forward.\"\n\nIt's easy to forget that Smith has been playing in the WSL for less than two years.\n\nAfter developing in Portugal with Sporting CP, one season at Liverpool was enough to convince Arsenal to spend big.\n\n\"There is more to come – she is still a young player, she is settling in the environment,\" said Slegers.\n\n\"It's been a while now, but don't underestimate what it takes for a player and her situation to settle and adjust to a new life.\n\n\"She's great to work with, her ability on the pitch is so good. She helps the team with her specific qualities, but she's also a pleasure to work with. She is making small steps but she is at a really high level.\"\n\nSmith let her team-mates down by getting sent off during the League Cup semi-final defeat by Manchester United last month, but she has bounced back in a serious way.\n\nArsenal may well be 10 points behind table-toppers City, but they look a different team to the one that struggled for consistency during the first half of the campaign.\n\n\"Players getting a rest mentally and physically has done us really well,\" said Slegers.\n\n\"There was a big tournament in the summer which put a high load on lots of players, so the [winter] break was really good.\n\n\"They have come back with so much new energy - that reset has been really important.\"\n\nSince the cup defeat by United, Arsenal have beaten Chelsea and City either side of winning the inaugural Fifa Champions Cup against Corinthians.\n\nAnd even if the WSL title looks out of reach - they have eight to play and a game in hand on City - more silverware may not be beyond them.\n\nThe European champions are favourites to progress through the next round of both the FA Cup and Champions League.\n\n\"The players' investment is so high at the moment, how we work together and [stay] humble in every moment - it's really good,\" said Slegers.\n\n\"Now it's about working hard on developing and pushing as hard as we can for the rest of the season.\n\n\"This positivity is contagious so we want to keep it going.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

With Sri Lanka 50-1 after the powerplay, eight consecutive overs of spin held them to just 87-4 as they were frustrated.\n\nHaving hit Barry McCarthy's final delivery of the powerplay for four, the co-hosts would not find another boundary until Kamindu Mendis brought up his side's 100 in the 16th over.\n\nWith Sri Lanka having finally saw the back of Delany and Dockrell, the partnership of Kamindu Mendis and Kusal Mendis were belatedly able to accelerate ahead, although they were helped in no small part by Irish errors in the field.\n\nThere were three drops in the space of four 17th-inning deliveries from Matthew Humphreys, who will feel his figures of 0-44 should come with an asterisk.\n\nWith Sri Lanka powering from 104-4 to 163-6 across the final four overs of their innings, Ireland's target was much tougher.\n\nWhile Ross Adair always felt the most likely to open the batting with Paul Stirling, there was still a decision to be made between the 31-year-old and Tim Tector coming into this tournament.\n\nAfter averaging 14 across the five warm-ups at the top of the order, Ireland's faith in the man who hit a T20 century against South Africa in 2024 again appeared wholly justified when, despite some less than aesthetic moments, he quickly motored to 34 thanks to five fours and a six.\n\nBut, after contributing two of those five drops in Sri Lanka's innings, Adair had another moment to forget when taking a wild heave at the bowling of a hobbling Hasaranga and having his stumps uprooted.\n\nWithout the thump of Adair and Stirling, who was earlier out for six after facing 13 balls, Ireland relied upon the running of Lorcan Tucker and Tector to keep the game in the balance.\n\nThe required run-rate was always on the rise though and, as Ireland tried to find the accelerator, miscues followed in their attempts to find the boundaries.\n\nThings get no easier in Group B with Ireland set to face Australia on Wednesday (09:30 GMT), while Sri Lanka are next in action a day later against Oman (05:30 GMT).",

    "fullText": "Troy girls' basketball head coach Will Harris was listening in closely during an interview with his star freshman players, Amaya Harris and Kiana Tiernan, following a game at Ballston Spa on Thursday.\n\nWhen the question was posed to the two freshmen about their goals for the future, and the Troy coach noticed some hesitation, he stepped in with an emphatic answer:\n\n\"Multiple championships,\" Will Harris said.\n\nThat is the tone Will Harris has set for his young Flying Horses team, which is led by his daughter, Amaya Harris, and Tiernan.\n\n\"To win it all, every year,\" said Amaya Harris, echoing her father. \"Multiple championships.\"\n\nThat is the type of confidence the freshman duo exhibits on the court for Troy, which is 16-2 overall this season and 12-0 in the Colonial Council.\n\nDespite being in her first year of high school, Harris is in her third year on Troy's varsity team, having been called up as a seventh-grader - during her father's first season as head coach in 2023-24. She is a 6-foot-0 guard and has proven herself to be one of Section 2's most prolific scorers.\n\nWith a total of 333 points on the season, Amaya Harris has averaged 19.6 points over her first 17 games. She also averages 7.9 rebounds and 6.7 assists per game.\n\nTiernan joined Amaya Harris on the Flying Horses last season as an eighth-grader. So far this season, the 6-foot-1 forward has scored 283 points and is averaging a double-double. She boasts an average of 16.6 points per game and 10.3 rebounds per game.\n\n\"Kiana has made such a jump from last year to this year in her skill level. It's amazing to watch her continued growth, as well as Amaya,\" Will Harris said. \" She works extremely hard at the game and really pours herself into basketball, getting better every single day. I'm just proud of them, and the work they're putting in.\"\n\nThe key for both young players is confidence, which they have built over the years while playing up in age during the AAU season.\n\n\"A lot of times they're playing two or three years up,\" Will Harris said. \"So being in that level of competition really helps with their confidence, their poise and knowing that no moment is too big for them.\"\n\n\"The work I've put in since seventh grade, playing against older girls, that's definitely shown me that I have nothing to be afraid of,\" Amaya Harris said. \"Regardless of my age or my size, I can do anything I set my mind to.\"\n\nThat confidence is on full display when Amaya Harris pulls up from long range, several feet beyond the 3-point arc, and gets nothing but net.\n\n\"Seeing her confidence, I think that's really helped our offense,\" Tiernan said of her teammate. \"You see how she's not afraid to go to the basket and see how she plays, it pushes everyone else to be confident and to go get their shot when they have the opportunity.\"\n\nTiernan's height and wingspan help her tower over most of her opponents, as she helps Troy secure many second- and third-chance opportunities beneath the rim.\n\n\"If she wasn't here, we wouldn't be where we're at now,\" Amaya Harris said of Tiernan. \"She's my right-hand man.\"\n\nWhile Troy's freshman duo gets a lot of attention from opposing defenses, accumulating the number of wins the Flying Horses have this season requires regular contributions up and down the roster.\n\n\"Addie Harkin is the unsung hero of our season,\" Will Harris said of his junior guard. \"She is one of the top defenders in Section 2, and probably the most athletic player in the area. There have been a lot of contributions from everybody, and the girls are buying into their roles and what it takes to win.\"\n\nWill Harris also does his part to boost the confidence and energy of his young group, which has only one senior, Mia Magnetto.\n\n\"I think that his energy is our energy,\" Amaya Harris said of her dad's coaching style. \"If he's excited, we're excited, and that's really what gets us going. His energy is our game.\"\n\nTroy's only two losses this season have come in non-league games against Columbia and Glens Falls. It has posted impressive wins over Guilderland, Schalmont, Bethlehem, La Salle, Albany Academy, and Ballston Spa.\n\nTroy and Columbia are both in contention for the top seed in the Section 2 Class AA tournament, which begins in two weeks.\n\n\"We're winning some games that people don't think we should win, so that target on our back is getting bigger and bigger,\" Will Harris said. \"We have to bring our A-game every time we step on the court, no matter what.\"\n\nThis article originally published at Troy girls' basketball team playing with confidence behind freshman duo.",

    "description": "RPI filed a motion to dismiss a lawsuit brought by transgender runner Sadie Schreiner that alleges she was discriminated against by being barred from entering a meet.",
    "fullText": "Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is seeking to dismiss a lawsuit brought by a transgender sprinter who claims that the Troy school violated New York state law and discriminated against her by refusing to let her compete at a meet hosted by the school this past April, according to recent court filings.\n\nIn documents filed Wednesday in state Supreme Court in Rensselaer County by attorney Suzanne M. Messer, RPI moved to dismiss the suit brought by Sadie Schreiner, a transgender woman who formerly competed for Rochester Institute of Technology. Schreiner's suit, which was filed in November, alleges that RPI violated the New York Human Rights Law when it barred her from competing in its \"Under the Lights Meet\" in April 2025 out of \"fear\" of reprisal from the U.S. Department of Education.\n\nRPI is seeking a hearing on its motion as soon as March 20. Schreiner's attorneys have until March 4 to file a response.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Schreiner claimed that by citing a February 2025 executive order by President Donald Trump that threatened to rescind funds from educational institutions that permit transgender athletes to compete in women's sporting events in its decision to deny Schreiner's entry in the RPI Under the Lights track meet in April 2025, the school discriminated against her under multiple sections of the New York Human Rights Law.\n\nGender identity or expression is a protected status under New York Executive Law.\n\nIn its response, RPI noted that its decision to deny Schreiner's entry into women's events at the meet was based on Trump's executive order, which in the months following its issuance resulted in the Department of Education initiating investigations into multiple universities.\n\nRPI also cited the position of the U.S. Department of Justice that the order was issued as a federal interpretation of Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972, which \"preempts any conflicting state laws under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution,\" including the New York Human Rights Law.\n\n\"To be sure, and despite some high-profile examples and rhetoric, the occasions where transgender females seek to compete against women in college sports, while increasing, are not frequent or pervasive in the U.S at this time,\" RPI's response reads. \"However, the application of anti-discrimination laws such as Title IX do not turn on frequency. New York State law may not penalize RPI for administering the Invitational in the very manner that federal law requires. That is precisely what the Supremacy Clause forbids.\"\n\nIn a statement issued Friday to the Times Union, RPI said it \"adheres to federal guidance on Title IX and we are unable to comment on ongoing litigation beyond what's contained in the public court filings.\" Messer, RPI's attorney, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSchreiner's attorney, Susan M. Cirilli, told the Times Union on Friday that she had \"no comment at this time.\"\n\nSchreiner, who won Liberty League championships in the 200 and 400 meters in 2024 while competing for RIT and was an NCAA Division III All-American in both events, alleges in her lawsuit that she registered for the RPI Under the Lights meet on April 8 - two days before the meet - and paid a $44 registration fee to compete as an \"unattached\" runner - a competitor not affiliated with any collegiate team or track club - in both of those events.\n\nThe following day, Schreiner received an email from RPI's general counsel denying her entry, citing Trump's February 2025 executive order.\n\n\"This executive order is not limited to NCAA competition,\" the email reads, according to the complaint. \"The U.S. Department of Education has, through communication and action, indicated that it intends to vigorously enforce this executive order under Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972.\"\n\nIn a memorandum of law in support of its motion, RPI asserts that Schreiner's claims of discrimination \"fail as a matter of law.\"\n\nWhile Schreiner in her lawsuit alleges she was discriminated against by being barred from competing in the event, RPI's response asserts that the school \"went only as far as was required by the federal mandate,\" in its email when it addressed Schreiner's request \"to compete specifically in the women's events\" at the meet.\n\n\"Nothing in RPI's communication conveyed – and Plaintiff does not allege – that she was barred from participating in the Invitational's events overall, was prohibited from attending the  Invitational, or was otherwise denied access to RPI's athletic facilities on the same terms as any other person because of her gender identity,\" the memo reads.\n\nThe memorandum also asserts Schreiner's claim that she was discriminated against by being denied use of a public accommodation is invalid, as the state Legislature \"expressly excluded\" colleges and universities from being defined as such under New York Executive Law.\n\nSchreiner, a New Jersey resident, gained prominence during the 2023-24 collegiate track and field season. The runner, who transitioned during high school, won Liberty League outdoor track titles in the 200 and 400 meters, and set a league record in the latter event.\n\nLocally, RPI, Union College and Skidmore are all Liberty League members.\n\nSchreiner finished third in the 200 and eighth in the 400 at the 2024 NCAA Division III championships - all while encountering protestors at meets.\n\nSchreiner did not compete for RIT during the 2025 season, instead competing as an \"unattached\" athlete at meets that allowed her to enter. The day after Trump issued his executive order in February 2025, the NCAA updated its transgender student-athlete participation policy to state that: \"A student-athlete assigned male at birth may not compete for an NCAA women's team. … This also applies to a student-athlete assigned male at birth competing as an individual against women. Such individual competition is not permitted under the policy.\"\n\nSchreiner has multiple active lawsuits regarding her being barred from competition. She filed lawsuits against Princeton University in July and the State University of New York at Geneseo in September. Schreiner also filed a case in September against the NCAA, noting that SUNY Geneseo followed the NCAA's policy when it barred Schreiner from competing at a meet.\n\nThis article originally published at RPI moves to dismiss discrimination lawsuit brought by transgender sprinter Sadie Schreiner.",

    "description": "A win on the road keeps the conversation going.",
    "fullText": "I can’t remember who said winning on the road was hard, but clearly they are out of their mind because Mizzou made it look easy.\n\nWinning on the road is hard. It helps when you’re playing the lowest rated team in KenPom. But you should never apologize for beating anyone, especially when it’s on their home court, and even moreso when you win by 19.\n\nUp next, on the road at Texas A&M (36), then home for Texas (38), then Vanderbilt (14) at home, and Arkansas (26) on the road. That’s just the next two weeks. Missouri was sitting at 68 in the NET heading into the game against South Carolina, but out-performing the margin by 18-20 points depending on your metric should bump them up quite a bit. But after the game they were sitting at 52nd in KenPom.\n\nWith the schedule heating up, the Tigers had to have this kind of performance. Not only for their own confidence, but you’re looking a lot different at a 15-8 team who is 5-5 in the SEC with no Quad 1 wins outside of SEC play than you are a 16-7 team, who is 6-4. The 6-4 record is a marker at this point because you’re in the same slot as Vanderbilt, Alabama, and Tennessee. All teams the Bracketologists consider safely in. And not just safely in but in the discussion for a protected seed.\n\nHeading into the game it was considered a toss up and you won by 19. Vanderbilt was a 92.2% chance to beat Oklahoma at home and lost. That game doesn’t really move the needle. It’s very unlikely OU is tournament bound, and Vanderbilt should look at it like more of a blip.\n\nBut the last four byes according to ESPN’s Joe Lundardi (not the most accurate bracketologist but the most widely known) are Saint Mary’s, Georgia, UCLA and USC. Georgia won, UCLA and Saint Mary’s were playing late, and USC plays today.\n\nThe last four in were Miami (beat Boston College), Texas (beat Ole Miss), New Mexico (x Boise State), and Ohio State (play Michigan today). Then there’s Cal (lost to Clemson at home), San Diego State (beat Air Force), Virginia Tech (lost at NC State), and Oklahoma State (lost at Arizona). So with those results, the Tigers are behind those teams and several of them lost.\n\nThe Tigers are going to lost again this year. I can almost guarantee it. They might even lose at Texas A&M and break their two game winning streak. But if they want to be on the right side of the bubble they need to find a way to at least go .500 down the stretch.\n\nArkansas, Tennessee, Vanderbilt and Texas are the home games. A&M, Arkansas, Mississippi State, and Oklahoma are the road games. And as of Saturday morning, OU and MSU were not Q1 road games.\n\nThis is life on the bubble, and it’s something we haven’t really had to worry about in the past.\n\nThe last time Mizzou was a true bubble team was probably 2011. If you’re a 9 seed you’re not really on the bubble, and of the Tigers 6 tournament appearances since 2011 they’ve been a 9 seed or higher. In 2011, Missouri was 22-9, but only 8-8 in the Big 12. They had 9 Q4 wins (yes the Quad system didn’t exist back then but the equivalent of a nothing win), so they were 13-9 in Q1-Q3 level games.\n\nThis year Missouri is 9-0 in Q4 games. They’re 7-4 in Q1-Q3. If they go .500 the rest of the way that would be 11-8, with a 20-11 overall record.\n\nYou did what you had to do just to stay in the conversation. The margin helps juice your metrics a bit, but now you still have to find a way to win more games. There are three Q1 games on your floor, which means you probably need at least two of those. But I say just keep winning until they can’t keep you out.\n\n21. Arkansas 88, Mississippi State 68",

    "description": "Ducati remains the ‘team to beat’ following the first three days of pre-season running, according to Aprilia",
    "fullText": "Aprilia believes it is heading into the 2026 MotoGP season in Ducati’s “slipstream”, conceding that the Borgo Panigale marque remains the benchmark in the championship.\n\nAfter enjoying its best season to date in MotoGP history, Aprilia was expected to make a step forward this year and potentially put itself in a position to mount a sustainable title challenge.\n\nBut while the Noale factory has genuinely improved the RS-GP in every metric, much of its gains have been negated by Ducati, which has managed to build a faster and more versatile version of the Desmosedici GP.\n\nAprilia's Massimo Rivola said he can be satisfied with the job the manufacturer did over the winter, but is wary of the progress rivals have made following the opening pre-season test of the year at Sepang.\n\n“I'm happy about the fact that the ‘26 bike is better than the ‘25. Again, it shows that Noale is quite a good company, able to make nice bikes but also improve the performance every year,” he said. “But we can only work on our bikes, on ourselves, and not on others.\n\n“We saw that almost everybody improved. We saw Honda being very fast, Ducati being the reference again and KTM being better than last year.\n\n“Honestly, I think it's going to be quite an interesting championship, again with someone [Ducati] leading. That is still the same, but we will stay in the slipstream.”\n\nDucati led the way in this week’s Sepang test, with Gresini’s Alex Marquez setting a best time of 1m56.402s on the factory-spec GP26. Aprilia’s Marco Bezzecchi didn’t finish too far off on the timesheets, with a late effort on the soft tyre vaulting him to second behind Marquez.\n\nHowever, in sprint race simulations, Ducati was clearly the class of the field, with Alex Marquez, Francesco Bagnaia and Marc Marquez all impressing with their average lap times. Bezzecchi was considerably slower than the trio, but his decision to run on worn tyres rendered any comparisons meaningless.\n\nAsked whether he felt Aprilia is closer to Ducati than it was last year, Rivola said: “I can't tell you yet, we need to take a closer look because in testing it's always difficult to know how many laps that tyre had done, how much fuel was in that tank.\n\n“Pecco did a sprint simulation, now we can all go home - see you in ‘27 (laughs).\n\n“I think that in any case we definitely have a better bike than last year. Last year didn't go badly, so we can't help but be optimistic. The others have clearly improved too. It's still a bit early to say. Ducati will be a benchmark anyway.”\n\nMotoGP will hold another two-day test at Buriram prior to the season-opening Thai Grand Prix on 1 March.\n\nWith a much longer gap between the two pre-season tests than last year, manufacturers have the opportunity to analyse the data from Sepang and bring new parts for Buriram before homologating their 2026 aero packages.\n\nAprilia will also evaluate certain new components at Buriram, but Rivola suggested that the core of the new RS-GP is largely defined.\n\n“There will be small parts also in Thailand,” he revealed. “I think 80-90% of the package will be fixed tonight [after Speang].\n\n“But after we analyse everything at home, small details will be brought to Thailand for the very last development in order to have quite a good base.\n\n“Obviously, Thailand is quite a different track in terms of aero, in terms of characteristics, it's more a stop-and-go track. There will be something more [from Aprilia].”\n\nYamaha: ’2026 MotoGP bike not performing badly but engine needs more power’\n\nHow Ducati sent a warning to its MotoGP rivals at Sepang test\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Super Bowl radio coverage 2026: Station, channel, streaming to listen live to Patriots vs. Seahawks broadcast originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NFL is down to two: Super Bowl 60 is sure to be cinematic as the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots go head-to-head at Santa Clara’s Levi’s Stadium on Sunday.\n\nHistory is repeating itself in the most dramatic way possible. Eleven years ago, these two teams met in Super Bowl 49, a game that ended with Malcolm Butler’s legendary goal-line interception that broke Seattle’s hearts and cemented a New England dynasty. Now, over a decade later, the Seahawks finally have their chance at revenge on the very same stage.\n\nFor the Seahawks, the road back has been defined by a total cultural shift under Mike Macdonald. While the 2015 squad relied on the original Legion of Boom, this version features a \"Dark Side\" defense that led the NFL in scoring defense this season. They aren't just playing for a ring; they are playing to erase the ghost of the one-yard line.\n\nOn the other side is a Patriots team that has pulled off one of the greatest one-year turnarounds in league history. Led by second-year sensation and MVP finalist Drake Maye and head coach Mike Vrabel, New England is looking to prove that the \"Patriot Way\" didn't leave with Tom Brady.\n\nThe narrative arc of this game is anchored by Seattle's Sam Darnold, whose career resurgence has been the story of the year. From being a castoff to leading a powerhouse, Darnold now faces the franchise that famously saw him \"seeing ghosts\" years ago. Alongside NFL receiving leader Jaxon Smith-Njigba, the Seahawks' offense is clicking at the perfect time to challenge New England’s gritty, bend-but-don't-break defense that's let up only 26 points this postseason.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 approaches, the league prepares for a sequel 11 years in the making. Whether Seattle finally gets its redemption or New England finds another hero like Butler, this matchup is destined to reshape the legacy of both franchises.\n\nHere is everything you need to know in order to listen to Seahawks vs. Patriots on the radio.\n\nRadio station: SiriusXM channel 225 (Patriots), 226 (Seahawks), 88 (national)\n\nSeahawks radio channel: Seattle Sports Radio 710 AM, KIRO Newsradio 97.3 FM\n\nPatriots radio channel:  98.5 The Sports Hub\n\nYou can listen to Super Bowl 60 live on SiriusXM. Along with the national broadcast on channel 88, there are team-specific broadcasts for both teams; the Seahawks are available on 226, and Patriots on 225.\n\nThose in the Seattle area can listen to the game on 710 AM or 97.3 FM, where Steve Raible, Dave Wyman and Jen Mueller will call the action. In Boston, it can be found on 98.5 The Sports Hub, which is the home for all Patriots games.\n\nListen to every NFL Game live on SiriusXM, where new subscribers can start with a free first month.

For Super Bowl 60, most affiliate stations within the competing teams’ networks must broadcast Westwood One's feed, with only the flagship station of each team permitted to carry its local coverage. These local feeds, however, remain accessible through SiriusXM and NFL+ (formerly Game Pass).\n\nThe national broadcast team is headlined by Kevin Harlan delivering play-by-play commentary for his 16th Super Bowl, with Hall of Famer Kurt Warner providing expert analysis. They are joined by sideline reporter Ross Tucker, while Scott Graham anchors the studio coverage for his 17th consecutive season.\n\nFor fans tuning in via the Patriots Radio Network, the game will be called by Bob Socci (play-by-play) alongside former Patriots quarterback Scott Zolak (analyst). Coverage is available on 98.5 The Sports Hub, the Patriots' flagship station, with their SiriusXM broadcast airing on Channel 225.\n\nFor Seattle Seahawks supporters, the local radio broadcast can be found on SiriusXM Channel 226. Coverage is available on Seattle Sports (710 AM) and KIRO NewsRadio (97.3 FM), with the legendary Steve Raible (play-by-play) and Dave Wyman (analyst) calling the action.\n\nMeanwhile, during halftime, SiriusXM’s Caliente (Channel 151) will provide live coverage and commentary of Bad Bunny’s performance at Levi's Stadium.",

    "description": "Iowa State's \"Big Citrus\" offers size and surprising athleticism. Could Domonique Orange be the run-stuffing force the Green Bay Packers desperately need?",
    "fullText": "It may feel a bit too early to start thinking about the 2026 NFL Draft, but mock draft season will be upon us before you know it. In fact, for many fans, mock draft season started the minute the Green Bay Packers' 2025 season ended.\n\nA lot is going to happen between now and April 23rd, when the draft kicks off in Pittsburgh. Right now, the Packers don't have a first-round pick, and they'll start their selections with pick No. 52, which is in the second round.\n\nNot having a first-rounder in the 2026 and 2027 NFL Drafts was part of the price the Packers paid for getting Micah Parsons. They gave a lot to get a lot back in return, and that's just part of the reality general manager Brian Gutekunst will have to work with unless he's able to swing another trade and somehow get back into the first round.\n\nSo who should the Packers target in Round 2 and beyond? There are going to be a ton of names thrown around and many of them will be great picks.\n\nEarlier this week, we focused on Iowa offensive lineman Gennings Dunker.\n\nNow, let's talk about Iowa State defensive lineman Domonique Orange:\n\nOrange may have the best nickname in the 2026 NFL Draft, and you can absolutely make the case that he has one of the best nicknames of all time.\n\nThey call him \"Big Citrus\", and there's a reason for that. Orange checks in at 6-foot-4, 325 pounds.\n\nHe's a big dude, and he knows what to do with his size.\n\nOrange is a run-stuffer, without a doubt. He's the guy you put at nose-tackle or one technique and ask him to take up a double team. The thing about him, though, is that he's surprisingly athletic for his size.\n\nNobody is going to confuse him with Devonte Wyatt, who is actually a great pass-rusher for being 6-foot-3, 304 pounds, but \"Big Citrus\" has the quick-twitch to be able to shoot the gap, and he's good at using his hands to get blockers off him.\n\nDomonique Orange (95) aligned head up on the RT before penetrating and eating the RB\n\nBig Citrus with a healthy dose of vitamin C-eek and destroy. Get it? Thank you for your time\n\n pic.twitter.com/lybgr8haI9\n\n— Anthony Cover 1 (@Pro__Ant) February 6, 2026\n\nThe Packers struggled a bit against the run this past season, averaging 117.7 yards per game given up on the ground.\n\nAdding Orange to this offensive line would go a long way. Speaking of Wyatt, he should be healthy by the start of the 2026 season, so new defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon would be able to pair him and Orange together on the inside. Both of those players will demand double-teams, but so does Micah Parsons on the edge.\n\nOrange is projected as a third-round pick but the Packers would absolutely be justified taking him in the second round. Even if they don't select him at No. 52, there's a chance he's still there at pick No. 84 in the third round, but if they like him, they may want to jump on him while they're able to in round two.\n\nPackersRoundtable also offers a fan community and message board.

Meanwhile, Dunkin hasn’t been quiet about rooting for the Patriots and even took to social media to post a map showing the state of Washington having no Dunkin locations.\n\n“This lobster roll is perfect — buttery and fresh,” she continues. “Seattle could never.”\n\nThe line drew comparison to the former Pats “First Lady” Gisele Bundchen, the supermodel and fitness fanatic who was married to quarterback Tom Brady when he led the New England team.\n\nMORE ANN MICHAEL: Drake Maye’s new wife trades parka for 6 pack-flaunting, skimpy workout outfit\n\nMORE ANN MICHAEL: Drake Maye’s new wife's outfit deemed ‘fire’ by NFL and adoring fans\n\n“Gisele never let us have Lobster Rolls! 🦞,” read the comment, which got more than a few replies from fans who agreed.\n\nAnn Michael wraps up her commercial with, “Boston baked goods anyone?”\n\nThe foodie has a popular baking show on NBC Sports Boston called Beyond Bakemus.\n\nDrake, 23, and Ann Michael married last June. The newlyweds have been together since middle school.

    "fullText": "Long before he landed with the Seattle Seahawks, quarterback Sam Darnold was pursued by two separate Denver Broncos general managers, as KUSA-TV's Mike Klis noted last week.\n\nEight years ago, then-GM John Elway was \"desperate to trade up\" for Darnold in the 2018 NFL draft. The New York Giants were unwilling to trade the second overall pick, and Darnold ended up landing with the New York Jets at No. 3 overall. Elway then made the biggest blunder of his career, selecting pass rusher Bradley Chubb over quarterback Josh Allen when Denver went on the clock at pick No. 5.\n\nFour years later, current GM George Paton pursued Darnold during NFL free agency in 2024, but the QB opted to join the Minnesota Vikings instead. Darnold revitalized his career in Minnesota, completing 66.2% of his passes for 4,319 yards and 35 touchdowns and 12 interceptions in 2024. Paton and coach Sean Payton added quarterback Bo Nix with the 12th overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft.\n\nSince then, Darnold is 28-6 as a starter and Nix is 24-10. Darnold and the Seahawks will face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX on Sunday evening.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL rumors: Broncos wanted to add QB Sam Darnold",

    "fullText": "Since figure skating debuted as an Olympic sport at the 1908 Summer Olympics in London, believe it or not, one country has dominated the medal count.\n\nIt has historically been the most-watched event at the Winter Olympics, and its athletes have become household names.\n\nThe figure skating Olympic program now consists of five events: men's singles, women's singles, pair skating, ice dance, and the team competition, which debuted in 2014 in Sochi, Russia, where athletes in the four disciplines compete as a team. There are six skaters per team, one each from the women's and men's singles, one pair skating team, and one ice dance couple.\n\nThe United States is the most decorated nation in figure skating, largely due to its technical skill with the introduction of the double axel and triple loop in the singles competition. The ice dance pair of Scott Moir and Tessa Virtue from Canada have the most Winter Olympic medals in history with five (three gold, two silver).\n\nHOW TO WATCH: Here's the complete 2026 Winter Olympics competition schedule\n\nUnited States — 54 (17 Gold, 16 Silver, 21 Bronze)\n\nCanada — 29 (6 Gold, 11 Silver, 12 Bronze)\n\nRussia — 27 (15 Gold, 9 Silver, 3 Bronze)\n\nSoviet Union — 24 (10 Gold, 9 Silver, 5 Bronze)\n\nAustria — 20 (7 Gold, 9 Silver, 4 Bronze)\n\nGreat Britain — 15 (5 Gold, 3 Silver, 7 Bronze)\n\nFrance — 14 (4 Gold, 3 Silver, 7 Bronze)\n\nGermany — 12 (5 Gold, 4 Silver, 3 Bronze)\n\nJapan — 11 (3 Gold, 5 Silver, 3 Bronze)\n\nEast Germany — 10 (3 Gold, 3 Silver, 4 Bronze)\n\nSweden — 10 (5 Gold, 3 Silver, 2 Bronze)\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: What country has most Olympic medals in figure skating?",

    "fullText": "CAMDEN, N.J. -- The Philadelphia 76ers are looking to move on after an uneventful trade deadline on their part. The Sixers moved promising second-year guard Jared McCain to the Oklahoma City Thunder and 18-year veteran Eric Gordon to the Memphis Grizzlies as Philadelphia found financial and roster flexibility for the future.\n\nAs the Sixers now move forward, President of Basketball Operations Daryl Morey will look to attack the buyout market as his next avenue of finding a way to improve the team. The Sixers are always looking for ways to improve the team and the buyout market is their next option as guys like Cam Thomas and Haywood Highsmith are at the forefront in terms of options.\n\n\"I think we're in the mix,\" Morey said without giving any indication on who the Sixers are looking at. \"I think they see a really good team or a really good market. We've had a lot of conversations already. We're obviously in competition with other teams, so I don't know if we'll get the first option necessarily, but we'll be in there with getting some of the top options.\"\n\nAt the moment, the Sixers have some roster spots to fill. They, obviously, signed Charles Bassey and Patrick Baldwin Jr. to 10-day contracts, but Philadelphia will need to fill those spots when those 10-day deals expire.\n\n\"I mean, we have two to fill,\" Morey explained. \"Obviously, (Dominick) Barlow was one of the signings. I think balancing it out with guard and wing might—we really want to go for best player. I mean, obviously that sounds trite, but that's true.\"\n\nWith the deadline done and over with, Morey and the Sixers still need to fill out the back end of the roster. The front office will now have to look at other avenues to fill those spots.\n\n\"You do want to focus on a little roster balance in terms of adding this deadline,\" Morey added. \"We thought, yeah, backfilling Paul (George) was a possible spot while he was out, but—I hate to repeat it again, the operative players that were available weren't adding in a way that was material out to what teams wanted us to give up for him.\"\n\nThe deadline did not produce any additions like Morey and the Sixers were hoping for, but the hope now is that the buyout market will give Philadelphia the players it's looking for.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sixers Wire: Daryl Morey discusses buyout market as Sixers move on after deadline",

    "description": "Liverpool Predicted Lineup and Injury Latest Ahead of Manchester City ClashLiverpool’s preparations for a crucial Premier League showdown with Manchester City have been shaped by a blend of returnin...",
    "fullText": "Liverpool’s preparations for a crucial Premier League showdown with Manchester City have been shaped by a blend of returning fitness, lingering absences and tactical adjustments. With Arne Slot seeking momentum in the second half of the campaign, the Reds’ predicted lineup and injury latest remain under close scrutiny.\n\nLiverpool have received a timely boost in defence, even as several key figures remain unavailable. The latest updates provide insight into how Slot is likely to shape his side for one of the defining fixtures of the season.\n\nJoe Gomez of Liverpool takes selfies with fans in the stands Liverpool v Crystal Palace, Premier League,\n\nLiverpool’s medical department has been busy in recent weeks, managing a congested fixture list and several long-term concerns. The most significant positive development is the return of Joe Gomez to first-team contention following a hip issue, offering Slot valuable depth across the back line.\n\nHowever, Jeremie Frimpong remains sidelined with a groin injury sustained earlier in the campaign, while Alexander Isak, Conor Bradley and Giovanni Leoni continue their respective recovery programmes. Their absence limits Liverpool’s options, particularly in wide defensive areas, where rotation has been restricted.\n\nThe Evening Standard reported that Gomez’s availability “has come at no better time” as Liverpool look to push towards the European places. This assessment reflects the broader picture: Slot is gradually regaining personnel, but the squad is still operating below full capacity.\n\nFitness management has become central to Liverpool’s approach this season. With high-intensity pressing still a feature of Slot’s philosophy, careful workload monitoring has influenced recent team selections and substitution patterns.\n\nLiverpool’s defensive structure is expected to remain largely consistent for the Manchester City fixture. Ibrahima Konate and Virgil van Dijk are set to continue their partnership at centre-back, providing physical presence and leadership against one of the league’s most dynamic attacks.\n\nAt right-back, Dominik Szoboszlai is likely to deputise once again in the absence of Frimpong. The Hungarian’s adaptation to the role has been one of the quieter success stories of recent weeks, combining energy with tactical discipline.\n\nOn the left side, Milos Kerkez is favoured to start, although Andy Robertson remains an alternative depending on match demands. Slot has rotated between the two in recent fixtures, balancing experience with athleticism.\n\nThis defensive unit reflects Liverpool’s current priorities: stability, positional awareness and controlled build-up. Against a City side known for exploiting half-spaces, maintaining compactness between full-backs and centre-backs will be essential.\n\nIn midfield, Alexis Mac Allister and Ryan Gravenberch are expected to retain their places as the double pivot. Their complementary profiles have brought greater balance, with Mac Allister dictating tempo and Gravenberch offering ball-carrying power.\n\nCurtis Jones remains in contention after a run of regular minutes, but current indications suggest continuity will be preferred for such a high-stakes encounter. Slot has consistently stressed the importance of rhythm and cohesion in central areas.\n\nAhead of them, Mohamed Salah, Florian Wirtz and Cody Gakpo are likely to operate in advanced roles, supporting Hugo Ekitike as the central striker. Ekitike’s recent brace against Newcastle reinforced his growing importance, particularly in matches requiring physical presence and pressing intensity.\n\nThis attacking configuration is designed to combine directness with creativity. Wirtz’s ability to operate between the lines, Salah’s wide threat and Gakpo’s movement offer multiple routes to goal, while Ekitike provides a focal point.\n\nBased on current fitness reports and recent selections, Liverpool’s predicted lineup is expected to be:\n\nAlisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike.\n\nThis XI reflects both necessity and intent. Injuries have narrowed the pool, but Slot has settled on a core group capable of executing his tactical framework under pressure.\n\nThe original Evening Standard analysis highlights how Liverpool’s recent win over Newcastle has boosted confidence ahead of this fixture. That result, combined with incremental improvements in squad availability, has created cautious optimism within the camp.\n\nFrom a strategic perspective, this lineup prioritises pressing coordination, transitional speed and defensive resilience. Against Manchester City, margins are fine, and Liverpool’s ability to manage possession without losing intensity will be decisive.\n\nWith the race for European qualification tightening, every point carries increased significance. This match represents not only a test of Liverpool’s current form, but also an indicator of how far Slot’s project has progressed.\n\nIf key players remain fit and the defensive unit continues to stabilise, Liverpool’s predicted lineup could provide the foundation for a strong finish to the campaign.",

    "fullText": "New York Giants linebacker Kayvon Thibodeaux is embracing the arrival of new head coach John Harbaugh, praising his \"old-school\" coaching style as a much-needed reset for the team.\n\nDuring Super Bowl week in San Francisco, Thibodeaux made inquiries about Harbaugh, speaking with \"a few older guys\" who had played under him in Baltimore. The feedback reinforced Harbaugh's reputation as a strict, no-nonsense leader who \"knows football and he loves football.\"\n\nThibodeaux expressed enthusiasm for the straightforward approach.\n\n\"I always like when you pass a certain age, you don’t have to sugarcoat what you say, you’re just kinda straightforward, white and black,\" Thibodeaux said, via the New York Post. \"You see a lot of different cultures, different people that want to sometimes change their ways for the new generation or they want to fit in or whatever the case may be.\n\n\"For me, specifically, I like old-school coaches because they just take no (expletive), black and white, you know what you’re gonna get every day. I think with a lot of young guys that we have, I think it’s gonna be good for him to really get it in order.\"\n\nThis comes after an earlier denial in January, when Thibodeaux dismissed suggestions on social media that Giants players were calling around about Harbaugh, responding to team legend Carl Banks: \"Nobody's doing this, Carl. Effort was never the problem.\"\n\nHis recent comments show he has since actively sought insights into the coach hired to turn around the franchise following seasons of inconsistency.\n\nThibodeaux, who had his fifth-year option picked up, remains optimistic about the defense under new coordinator Dennard Wilson and is relieved that position coach Charlie Bullen was retained... For now.\n\nAfter a 2025 season cut short by injury, Thibodeaux is cleared medically and eager to thrive in Harbaugh's structured environment.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Giants' Kayvon Thibodeaux loves John Harbaugh's 'old-school' coaching style",

    "fullText": "The 2022-23 UNC basketball season was a tough, painful one that most fans likely remember to this day. A year after making the NCAA Tournament Championship Game, North Carolina missed the NCAA tournament – and declined an NIT invite.\n\nThose Tar Heels brought in a 4-man recruiting class, but only one remains in Chapel Hill to this day: Seth Trimble, a senior guard from Menomonee Falls, Wis.\n\nNow UNC's captain in his fourth and final season of college basketball, Trimble delivered the greatest moment of his collegiate career on Saturday night against Duke.\n\nWith time expiring, Trimble caught a pass in the corner from Derek Dixon. Trimble launched a wide-open three over Caleb Foster's outstretched arms, watched it swish through the net and joined his teammates in pandemonium after North Carolina's thrilling, 71-68 upset of its archrival.\n\nAfter the game, Trimble detailed what making that shot meant, particularly in the final UNC-Duke game he'll play in Chapel Hill.\n\n“It’s special,\" Trimble said. \"I’m going to remember this for the rest of my life. No matter how this year ends, as I grow older, this will be something that I remember, celebrate with my teammates, see the fans storm the court. My dad found me on the court, because the game wasn’t over but he did find me. Just making a play like that, last home (UNC-Duke) game, knowing how much this game meant to me was definitely crazy.”\n\nTrimble scored the Tar Heels' (19-4, 7-3 ACC) first five points, so his game-winning 3-pointer proved fitting for the perfect ending. Trimble ended his night with 16 points (second behind Caleb Wilson's 23), three steals, two rebounds and one block.\n\nIn a college basketball era dominated by NIL money and the transfer portal, Trimble is a rare find. His loyalty, persistence and true passion for the Carolina Blue finally paid off on Saturday night against Duke (21-2, 10-1 ACC) – in a moment he'll remember forever.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on. Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: Seth Trimble says he will remember shot vs Duke for rest of his life",

She lost her balance and crashed, with her left leg, which had sustained a significant ACL injury just over a week ago, gave way.\n\nVonn was heard crying out in agony as medical staff surrounded her. After a significant pause in the time trial proceedings, she was placed on a stretcher and airlifted to a hospital. It was a devastating sight, as the 2010 downhill Winter Olympic champion, who has won four World Cups in a storied career, left the snow for what is almost certainly the final time.\n\nCompeting against a field of world-class downhill skiers, Vonn was competing as the 13th of 36 racers in Cortina d’Ampezzo.\n\nBBC Sport reporter Chemmy Alcott, a former skier who was often Vonn’s competition in the past, was visibly distressed by the event and noted that Vonn was given a standing ovation as the helicopter carrying her took off.\n\nThe Women’s Downhill has now resumed, as the Olympic world awaits news on Vonn’s conditions.\n\nVonn had trained well and set the third-quickest time in practise runs yesterday. Her teammaker, the reigning women’s downhill world champ Breezy Johnson, had earlier set the fastest time and looks set to have won the gold.\n\nVonn was considered to be the highest-profile athlete at the 2026 Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics.

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn's Winter Olympic dream ended in screams of pain on Sunday after she crashed out of the women's downhill, failing in her audacious bid to medal in her favoured discipline at the Milan-Cortina Games.\n\nThe American star had been trying to claim the fourth Olympic medal of her career despite suffering a ruptured anterior cruciate ligament in her left knee just over a week ago, but her race ended after just 13 seconds in Cortina d'Ampezzo.\n\nShe cried in anguish and pain after her awful fall high up the course, medical staff surrounding the distraught 41-year-old on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste where has enjoyed much success in the past.\n\nThe 2010 Olympic downhill champion hit the firm snow face first soon after pushing off from the gate.\n\nShe then rolled down the slope with her skis still attached, which could likely cause further serious damage to her knee.\n\nVonn's Olympic dream now lies in tatters after her brave effort to achieve the seemingly impossible, an attempt which ended with her being taken away in a helicopter as fans in the stands saluted her with loud applause.\n\nHer US teammate Breezy Johnson, sitting in the leader's chair, held her face in shock. At the time Vonn crashed, Johnson, the world downhill champion, was in front of Germany's Emma Aicher by just 0.04sec following her powerful run.\n\nJohan Eliasch, the president of the International Ski Federation (FIS) who was watching the race in Cortina, said Vonn's crash was \"tragic, but it's ski racing I'm afraid\".\n\n\"And I can only say thank you for what she has done for our sport because this race has been the talk of the Games and it's put our sport in the best possible light.\"\n\nEliasch added: \"I hope she will have a speedy recovery and back on skis very, very soon.\n\n\"A lot of people are going to say she shouldn't have been racing today (with) that type of injury. It's obviously her decision.\"\n\nOne of world sport's most recognisable faces and an alpine skiing icon, Vonn has insisted that she could not only compete but win against the world's best women skiers, some of whom like Aicher are nearly half her age.\n\nVonn said ahead of the Games that she was planning on also competing in the team combined event on Tuesday and the super-G two days later.\n\nBut that now looks unlikely, a potential long lay-off perhaps heralding the end of her comeback to skiing in her early 40s.\n\nVonn retired in 2019 but returned to compeition in November 2024 following surgery to partially replace her right knee to end persistent pain.\n\nHad she not crashed in the last World Cup downhill ahead of the Olympics, in Crans Montana at the end of January, Vonn would have been a serious contender for gold in Cortina.\n\nVonn had finished on the podium in every previous World Cup downhill race this season, including two victories in St. Moritz and Zauchensee, and claimed two more top-three finishes in the super-G.\n\nBut retirement looms for Vonn following a disastrous end to one of the biggest stories of the Winter Olympics.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid star Endrick Felipe has had a fast start to life in France since completing his loan move to Olympique Lyon. The Brazilian teenager has suffered his first setback in Ligue 1 though.\n\nIn his first five games for Lyon across Ligue 1 and the Coupe de France, Endrick scored five times and gave an assist. Beyond the numbers, he has left fans in awe of his ability, with the quality of the goals and his technical ability becoming a talking point in France.\n\nHowever his sixth appearance has brought his first setback, after he was sent off for Lyon in their match against Nantes. As he competed for the ball on the touchline with the Dehmaine Tabibou, Endrick kicked out at the defender, and was sent off after a VAR review.\n\nEndrick has been receiving plenty of attention from the Nantes defenders throughout, and had already been involved in battles. Lyon went on to lose the game 1-0 to Nantes, halting their good run, as well as that of Endrick.\n\nIt seems to be an area of his game he is still working on. Despite his limited minutes under Carlo Ancelotti, Endrick lashed out at defenders twice during tussles with opposition players. One of them he escaped punishment for, but he was sent off against\n\nAt this stage of his career, it’s tricky to ask him to have the presence of mind of a more mature player, but if defenders feel that he can be coaxed into sending offs, then he will be targeted. No doubt Paulo Fonseca will be doing his best to ensure Endrick understands it is a skill that he must improve.",

    "description": "Isaiah Collier is evolving in the NBA. He is making a great case for being one of the Utah Jazz's building blocks of the future",
    "fullText": "One of the best stories recently in the NBA has been second-year former Trojan Isaiah Collier continuing to make the most of his opportunities. After Collier's career night, dishing out 22 assists, 17 points, and 3 steals, Collier built off that and led his team in scoring.\n\nThe Jazz have been without Keyonte George, and Collier is making up for the majority of his impact. Collier last night had a team-high 25 points, 11 assists, and 3 steals again. Collier has now had 5 straight games with a steal and a combined 13 steals in that span. It is not just his scoring output or his ability to find his teammates for good looks; he is also quite the defender.\n\nCollier is becoming more and more of a polished all-around basketball player. Any team, regardless of how deep the rotation is, can use a guy like Collier. He is proving to be extremely valuable for this team moving forward.\n\nThe Jazz are not looking to win games this season, even after the trade for star forward Jaren Jackson Jr. and ascending young players. This team wants a shot at a top pick in the upcoming draft. This upcoming class is full of stars. Yet when you are not trying to win, it is important to allow your young guys an opportunity to develop and see which players will be building blocks for the future.\n\nNow, after his recent great production in his starts, Collier is proving to be one of the pieces for the Utah Jazz moving forward. He is now averaging 10 points, 7.1 assists per contest, and shooting 50% from the field. He may not likely be a starting player for the Jazz when this lineup is ready to contend, but he has definitely shown he will be a key contributor in the rotation. Heck, he has shown he can be a player that steps up when stars go down with injury.\n\nThe Utah Jazz are building some special, and part of that is because of how great the former USC Trojan Isaiah Collier has been this season. The Jazz may not get any real success this season, but the next season should be one in which conversations about the Jazz look very different.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Trojans Wire: Isaiah Collier is enhancing USC basketball brand in NBA with Jazz",

    "fullText": "Manchester United youngster Tyler Fletcher has opened up on the emotions he was going through as he made his senior debut in Saturday’s 2-0 victory against Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nTyler came on in place of Kobbie Mainoo in the dying embers of the triumph over Thomas Frank’s Tottenham side.\n\nUnited clinched all three points courtesy of strikes in either half from Bryan Mbeumo and Bruno Fernandes. With the win secured and the visitors reduced to 10 men after Cuti Romero was given his marching orders during the opening 45 minutes for a reckless challenge on Casemiro, Michael Carrick thrust Tyler into the action.\n\nIt was a steady cameo for Fletcher, who completed all seven passes that he attempted. He follows in the footsteps of his twin brother, Jack Fletcher, who also made his debut in December last year.\n\nTyler becomes United’s 258th Academy graduate.\n\nAfter the final whistle, he spoke to MUTV and revealed his delight at the outstanding achievement.\n\nHe said, “It’s a mad day. I’m absolutely buzzing. The best day of my life, it’s a dream come true. I’ve just got to thank everyone for supporting me, throughout the way.”\n\n“It’s an honour to have one of those [Academy] numbers. Not many people do it. I’m grateful it’s happened. To get to go on the pitch and play at Old Trafford, it’s a special feeling.”\n\nThe debutant added, “I found out I was in the squad yesterday, after the session. I got told you will be with the first team, you’ll be on the bench. I was buzzing with that.”\n\n“I was warming up in the last five minutes and five minutes got added on. I got the call and I was like, ‘No way is this happening’. I got told to go and enjoy it and make as many passes as you can, get as many touches as you can, and that’s what I did.”\n\nAsked what Carrick was spotted telling him on the touchline, Tyler added, “He [Carrick] just said enjoy it. Make the most of the moment. Go and get on the ball and do what you do, try to get as many touches as I can when I was on there, so I was trying to get little bounce passes, little short ones, just to get a few touches. That is what he said.”\n\n“That’s the best moment of my career so far. I don’t think anything can top it. It’s a special moment for my family. I think my mum is here, my brother is here. My dad has got a game so he couldn’t make it.”\n\nUnited are next in action on Tuesday when they go away to West Ham.\n\nFeatured image Ben Roberts photo via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Vonn has lived her life audaciously, and Sunday we saw an all-time skiing talent trying desperately, maybe too desperately, to win a race the rest of us just wanted her to finish.",
    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy – It was devastating to watch, even more brutal to hear.\n\nFor a nation that had become enraptured in Lindsey Vonn’s comeback story and the norm-defying attempt to win an Olympic medal without an ACL in her left knee, the helpless cries of pain as she lay on her back and the mountain fell silent will be hard to erase from memory.\n\nDownhill skiing is often breathtaking. It is sometimes gruesome. And for the second time in nine days, the images of an American sports heroine being strapped to a board and lifted into a helicopter churned the stomach.\n\nBut that’s skiing down a mountain at 80 miles per hour. That’s the risk Vonn signed up for when she decided to compete in an Olympics nine days after an ACL tear during a different competition in Switzerland. That’s what happens sometimes when you go for it.\n\nAnd that’s exactly what Vonn did.\n\nWe may never know for sure, but Vonn’s knee may not have even been the culprit for crashing just 13 seconds into her run. If anything, the chain of events that led to her breakdown Sunday started by taking a highly aggressive line into a curve with all her weight shifted to the right — not the injured left leg. Instead, it was her right pole getting tangled with the gate that threw her off balance, launching her into the air, onto her stomach as she hit the snow and then onto her back as she slid several more feet.\n\nJust like that, it was over. And awful.\n\nLike clockwork, there will undoubtedly be detractors who say Vonn shouldn’t have tried something so dangerous, so audacious.\n\nBut Vonn, 41, has lived her entire life audaciously. She also knows more about what can happen on a ski slope, for better and worse, than the rest of us put together.\n\nShe understood what could happen. She deserved the chance. And now, only she can answer whether the consequences for her body were worth it.\n\nWas it sickening to see play out in real time? Of course. But when we turn on a sporting event, especially in the Winter Olympics, we are not guaranteed an experience free of discomfort.\n\nMany of these sports are dangerous. Usually, the athletes make them look easy. Sometimes we take for granted their tolerance for risk.\n\nBut this one slaps us all in the face — not just because it’s one of the most accomplished winter sport athletes in the world but because her pain, as it played out on television for millions of people, connects deeply to our own sense of fear and mortality.\n\nYes, this injury will cast a pall over these Olympics. How can it not? What we watched Sunday wasn’t just sports, it was a microcosm of life. At some point, no matter how invincible we might feel, it can all change in an instant.\n\nVonn had no doubt she could do it. Her training runs were fine. She spent part of Saturday beefing with detractors on social media, oozing the kind of confidence that made you realize she wasn’t just there to glide down a hill.\n\nShe was all-in. Maybe to her detriment.\n\nSome will say it was all a delusion, that doctors shouldn’t have given her the green light, that she should have given her spot in the field to a younger, healthier American.\n\nAre you really going to tell one of the legends of the sport, someone who came out of retirement and almost immediately re-established herself one of the best in the world, that she can’t have this chance? Please.\n\nI asked downhill ski racer Bryan Bennett about that notion Saturday after his final Olympic run.\n\n“She’s won Cortina I don’t know how many times,” he said.  “She understands that downhill. Her equipment’s obviously been in a good place. If she can just hold it together for one run … I don’t think she has to risk incredibly. It’s not like she has to do anything crazy special.”\n\nPerhaps one day, after the injuries heal, Vonn will tell us whether that’s what cost her. For now, we can only go off what we saw on television — and what it looked like was an all-time skiing talent trying desperately, maybe too desperately, to win a race the rest of us just wanted her to finish.\n\nVonn has crashed before, blown out her knee before, felt pain few of us can fathom before. She knew it could happen again and tried anyway.\n\nShe went for it. Who are we to second-guess?",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLindsey Vonn worked so hard to come back and compete in the Winter Olympics at age 41.\n\nA torn ACL for the U.S. skiing legend in her last tuneup race wasn't going to stop her, either.\n\nBut then on Sunday, as she raced downhill in her first event at these 2026 Milan-Cortina Olympics, Vonn's ski clipped one of the gates. It sent her spiraling and crashing forward.\n\nVonn had to be airlifted away after the crash, and her highly anticipated return instead led to a brutal scene for everyone who woke up early to watch.\n\nThe crash happens about 15 seconds in to the below video:\n\nSKI ALPIN 🎿 Quelques jours seulement après sa blessure au genou, la légendaire skieuse américaine Lindsey Vonn chute après avoir à peine entamé sa descente en finale. 🙁#MilanoCortina2026#rcsports#skialpin#jeuxolympiquespic.twitter.com/fOCEerx6qi\n\n— Radio-Canada Sports (@RC_Sports) February 8, 2026\n\nMORE: The Olympics reason Ilia Malinin doesn't have a girlfriend\n\nIt's too early to speculate on potential injuries.\n\nThis is a different kind of crash than the ones often seen in skiing, where a competitor simply loses control on a change of direction.\n\nHere, it's clear Vonn's ski caught onto one of the gates, which caused her to lose her balance. So there wasn't an injury that caused the loss of control, but rather potential injury caused by clipping the gate.\n\nSkiing isn't for the faint of heart. Vonn has a long injury history, as do most of the competitors.\n\nBut given Vonn's comeback story, this one is particularly painful. Eventually, we'll learn whether Vonn can compete later in the Olympics.\n\nFor now, U.S. fans are just hoping she's OK.\n\nWhy Eileen Gu competes for China, not U.S.\n\nNBC's drone cameras have everyone's attention\n\nThe Winter Olympics mascots are adorable\n\nEverything about Snoop Dogg's roles at the Olympics\n\nThis is what Russia's Olympic hockey roster would've looked like\n\nHow Laila Edwards is making U.S. women's hockey history",

She immediately held her damaged left knee and screamed in pain when she came to a standstill.\n\nShe was taken away by helicopter after lengthy treatment on site.\n\nThere was a stunned silence in the finish area where spectators included rapper and honorary US coach Snoop Dogg and Italian ski great Alberto Tomba who had lit the Olympic cauldron on Friday.\n\nTeam-mate Breezy Johnson, the reigning world champion, was leading the race at the time, four-hundredths ahead of German Emma Aicher.\n\nTwice world champion Vonn, 41, won downhill gold in 2010 and bronze in 2018, plus super-g bronze in 2010. She came out of retirement last season with a partially artificial right knee, aiming for more Olympic glory on the Olimpia delle Tofane piste where she has won 12 of her 84 World Cup races.\n\nShe led this term's downhill standings with two victories and podiums in the other three races as well before damaging her knee nine days ago in a crash in the Crans-Montana downhill.\n\nShe still decided to compete at the Olympics and was third in the final training run on Saturday, racing with a brace.\n\nVonn had hoped for one more moment of Olympic glory as she was a veteran of fighting through the pain barrier at the Games, starting at her debut in Turin 2006.\n\nTwenty years ago, Vonn competed with a heavily bruised hip from a training crash after which she was airlifted to hospital, claiming top 10 finishes in downhill and super-g and receiving the US team's Olympic Spirit Award for her courage.\n\nAt the 2010 Games in Vancouver her start was heavily endangered when she suffered shin bruises but she defied those to claim downhill gold which up to now remains her lone Olympic title, plus super-g bronze.\n\nFour years later she appeared determined to compete in Sochi despite a partially ruptured cruciate knee ligament but had to cancel when the ligament was revealed to be fully torn a few weeks before the Games.",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn crashed seconds into her downhill Olympic race on Sunday after she decided to compete despite rupturing her left ACL in a prior crash during a World Cup event in the Swiss Alps a week ago.\n\nThe 41-year-old American, who came out of retirement to compete in the 2026 Winter Olympics, earlier confirmed that she had fully ruptured her ACL, but said she felt confident she could still complete the race with the help of a knee brace.\n\nSeconds into the race, Vonn lost control after she appeared to clip a flag marking the side of the course, flew sideways in the air and hit her head on the ground. She was responsive but did not get up. Medical personnel put her on a stretcher and airlifted her from the course.\n\nAfter the crash, Vonn could be heard screaming that she wasn't able to remove her skis.\n\nVonn had family in the stands, including her father, Alan Kildow, who stared down at the ground while his daughter was being treated. Others in the crowd, including Snoop Dogg, watched quietly as the star skier was finally taken off the course where she had so many fond memories.\n\nThomas Pronske from Austin, Texas, who was watching the event on the sidelines, told CBS News after the accident: \"I hope she's OK. It did not look good. We saw her take quite a bit of a tumble and I'm praying and wishing for the best for her... She was a very big reason why I was here. It's just remarkable the comeback story of her overcoming adversity ... I've torn my ACL myself, I know it's a painful injury... and again I hope she's ok.\"\n\nCrista Kosher, the cousin of Jacqueline Wiles, another Team USA skier, said it was \"absolutely devastating to see her teammate be lifted off the hill.\"\n\n\"Lindsay and Jacqueline have been racing together for years and years and years now, and they definitely have a mentor-mentee relationship, and seeing her friend go down is really challenging for everyone, but we wish the best for Lindsay and her recovery,\" Kosher said.\n\nCharles Christianson, a retired ex-ski racer from Park City, Utah, said the crash was \"absolutely heartbreaking.\"\n\n\"Everyone is here to cheer on the entire American team and especially celebrate Lindsay's incredible career. This is absolutely heartbreaking, but true to form, Lindsay wouldn't have it any other way,\" Christianson said. \"She knew the risks. Ski racers always accept it and you saw the determination when she went out of the gate. She was charging. There was never a doubt in her mind what she was going to do and it was gonna be podium or bust and it goes both ways. So again, the respect of the crowd and everyone here shows how important she's been to the sport. We're going to have to see what happens. We wish her the best. But just a gut punch.\"\n\nAhead of Sunday's race, one Team USA official had said that Vonn getting into a bad crash during the race was their biggest fear. Given all the attention on her and her inspiring story, the image of her being airlifted off the course during the race was their worst-case scenario.\n\nBefore her retirement in 2019, Vonn had competed with a torn lateral collateral ligament, three tibia fractures and a bone bruise, and still won a bronze medal. She now has one titanium knee, though that's not the joint that's currently injured.\n\n\"Just getting to these Olympics has been a journey, and one that some did not believe in from the start,\" Vonn said in a social media post late Saturday. \"I retired for 6 years, and because of a partial knee replacement, I had the chance to compete one more time. But why? Everyone seems to be asking me that question. But I think the answer is simple… I just love ski racing.\n\n\"I am not unsure about life outside of sport. I am not searching for meaning or for attention or money. I know exactly who I am and I know exactly what I am made of,\" she said.\n\nVonn had clocked the third-fastest time in a training run on Saturday, ahead of the race — behind her teammate Breezy Johnson — though the run was called off due to bad weather before all the racers had participated.\n\n\"I think it's a good run,\" Vonn's coach, Aksel Lund Svindal, said. \"Tomorrow is the race and it's the Olympics and the girls will push harder. So everyone will probably go faster, meaning Lindsey would also need to go faster. But it's a solid run, but I think she has one more gear.\"\n\nJohnson raced ahead of Vonn and completed the run in just over 1:36.\n\nWhite House says it removed Trump post with racist video of Barack and Michelle Obama\n\nLuigi Mangione yells out in court as judge sets New York trial for June\n\nRacist video shared by Trump depicting Obamas as apes taken down",

    "fullText": "American skier Lindsey Vonn crashed out of the women's downhill competition at the Winter Olympics nine days after rupturing ligaments in her left knee.\n\nThe 41-year-old had successfully completed two training runs on the iconic Olimpia delle Tofane course in Cortina but crashed early in her run.\n\nShe was tended to for a lengthy period on the slope before being airlifted off the piste.\n\nVonn was taking a huge risk by competing on Sunday having suffered the ACL injury in Switzerland in the last World Cup race before the Games.\n\nBut she was determined to take to the course in what she says will be her final Olympics.\n\nStunned spectators in the stands applauded towards the helicopter as it carried her away from the piste which has brought her so much success in the past - with 12 of her 84 World Cup wins coming here.\n\nVonn had been unsure what her knee was capable of withstanding but had targeted the downhill as her favoured event while also being entered in the super-G and team events.\n\nIt is now unlikely she will compete in any of those, meaning her Olympic career has likely come to a devastating end.\n\nVonn was the 13th skier to go in the women's downhill and clipped the first gate which put her off balance as she was turning when she crashed.\n\nThe treatment she needed after the crash led to a significant delay to the competition, which compatriot Breezy Johnson led at the time.\n\nJohnson held her head in her hands as she watched her team-mate carried away by the helicopter.\n\nVonn had appeared relaxed in the training runs and in the morning before the race. Her coach Aksel Lund Svindal said on Friday that he felt confident she could pull off something spectacular.\n\nNo stranger to a comeback, Vonn retired from the sport in 2019 as the most decorated female skier at the time but had suffered several serious leg injuries.\n\nShe made a shock return to the sport in 2024 having had a partial knee replacement in her right knee.\n\nVonn was tipped for the podium in Cortina following a successful 2025-26 season, in which she reached the podium in all five races, winning two.\n\nBut this latest crash leaves a significant doubt over whether Vonn will ski competitively again.\n\nWinter Olympics: Johnson set for downhill gold after US team-mate Vonn's crash - watch\n\nVonn knew the risk she was taking by competing on Sunday and had even hit back at a doctor on social media who claimed the injury was \"not a fresh tear\".\n\nShe responded by saying her ACL is \"100% torn\" and had hoped to defy the odds by replicating the Olympic downhill gold medal she won in Vancouver in 2010.\n\nVideos on social media had shown her training in the gym after she said she had no pain or swelling of the knee, while two smooth runs in the build-up to the race had given her, and her team and fans, confidence.\n\nFour-time British Olympian Chemmy Alcott was emotional on BBC coverage and said she \"never believed\" it would end in this way.\n\n\"What we saw [is] that the top of the piste is really hard for a fit athlete. It is brutal, think about her family, her team and herself.\n\n\"We have to be realistic - the risk was really high, the risk she takes when she falls will double that. Her body will not be able to take that.\"\n\nAlcott added that the long delay would also mean the snow on the piste would begin to melt in the midday sun, and therefore it would be unlikely that anyone would beat Johnson's time of one minute 36.10 seconds.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table",

    "fullText": "Streamer Jack Doherty made the headlines for the wrong reasons in round two of the WM Phoenix Open on Friday.\n\nHe paid a spectator $100 to shout during Mackenzie Hughes’ backswing at TPC Scottsdale.\n\nThis behavior is strictly forbidden at PGA Tour events, and Doherty was later given a lifetime ban.\n\nThe streamer then posted a message on social media, claiming that golf fans are “soft” for taking it so seriously.\n\nTour winner Michael Kim, who is also playing at the Phoenix Open, has now issued a brutally honest response to Doherty.\n\nBesides the incident, Doherty annoyed the golf community even more by tweeting, “all you guys are soft.”\n\nHowever, Kim, who often speaks his mind on social media, was not prepared to let Doherty get away with his comment.\n\nThe world number 43 replied: “Lol, ‘soft.’ Hey Jack, just have a little bit of respect for guys trying to do their jobs.\n\n“You’re the one who sounds soft for talking like a crybaby after getting kicked out of a golf tournament.”\n\nKim is absolutely right to call out Doherty’s naivety in failing to understand why his behavior was unacceptable.\n\nThankfully, Mackenzie Hughes was not distracted too much by Doherty’s foolishness at the Phoenix Open.\n\nThe shout came early enough in his swing that he could back out and take a few moments to compose himself.\n\nHughes also realized that the streamer was trying to cause a stir, and it was nothing personal against him.\n\n“It happens at this tournament sometimes,” he explained to The Athletic. “Yeah, I saw the video. Honestly, I didn’t lose much sleep over it.\n\n“My caddie and the security staff were all pretty prompt to kick whoever it was out… I feel like I wasn’t really much of the story.\n\n“I just happened to be the guy that was there… I’m not really much of a social media guy, so I had no idea who it was.”\n\nThe rule Jack Nicklaus was wrong about changing at Augusta National\n\nWhy Scottie Scheffler still isn’t using TaylorMade’s new Qi4D Driver\n\nBrandel Chamblee responds to Players Championship Major talk with big claim",

    "fullText": "In November, approval of Trump’s presidency fell to a new low in his second term, with 36% approving and 60% disapproving. Among all items on the current agenda, his Ukraine policy attracts the least support, with only 31% approving. It ranks lowest even among Republicans, with approval at just 67%, compared with 85% approval for Trump’s foreign policy overall. At the same time, the share of Americans who believe that US assistance to Ukraine is insufficient has reached a wartime high of 46%.\n\nA survey by the Ronald Reagan Institute focused on national security shows that the foreign policy views of the average American largely remain within the framework of traditional US doctrine and are not strongly influenced by the relativism of Trump’s transactional approach. Between 75 and 80% of those surveyed view Russia as an enemy and consider Ukraine an ally. More than 60% want Kyiv to win, and two thirds support arms deliveries to Ukraine, including Tomahawk missiles for strikes on Russian territory, as well as the provision of security guarantees akin to NATO’s Article 5.\n\nTrump’s peace efforts also fail to convince the American public. According to an Economist/YouGov poll, 42% of Americans believe the president is more likely to side with Russia, while only 22% think he takes a balanced position. Although Americans are not well informed about the details of the Trump administration’s peace plan, the net balance of its ratings is negative by 10 percentage points, falling to minus 17 once respondents become familiar with its specifics. Among Republicans, support for the plan drops from 57 to 38% after exposure to its details. This experiment suggests that American society would place responsibility for the consequences of an unstable agreement between Russia and Ukraine on Trump and his perceived pro Russian tilt. In contrast to Trump, most Americans see Putin as a cynical aggressor who cannot be trusted to honour agreements, with 87% believing he would violate any deal that is concluded.\n\nIn November, President Trump’s approval rating reached a new low for his second term, at 36% approving versus 60% disapproving, according to regular Gallup polling. The decline is driven by Republicans, whose approval fell from 90 to 86%, and by independents, where it dropped from 33 to 25%. The three policy areas in which Trump receives the lowest approval are healthcare, with 30% approving, the federal budget at 31%, and Ukraine at 31%. Notably, the lowest ratings of Trump’s Ukraine policy come not only from independents, among whom just 23% approve, but also from Republicans, at 67%, compared with 85% approval for his foreign policy overall. The Ukraine issue can therefore be described as one of the points of an anti Trump consensus in American society.\n\nDissatisfaction with the direction of policy on Ukraine and a shift in public attitudes were already evident in Gallup's August poll. Here, 46% of those surveyed said that the US was providing insufficient assistance to Ukraine, the highest level since the start of the war, while the share who viewed aid as excessive fell to 25%. In December 2024, the balance stood at 30% saying aid was insufficient versus 37% saying it was excessive. That marked the peak of American fatigue with the Ukraine issue. The subsequent shift in the opposite direction began as early as March and was driven mainly by independents.\n\nSimilarly, in December 2024, 50% of Americans believed that the United States’ main task in relation to the Russia–Ukraine conflict was to seek a rapid peace even at the cost of concessions to Russia, while 48% favoured helping Ukraine to regain territories occupied by Russia. By March and August, the share supporting the first position had fallen to 45%, while support for the second had risen to 52%. The share favouring the latter increased by 11 percentage points among Democrats and by 7 among Republicans. Particularly striking is the fact that in August 87% of Americans believed that Putin would violate any agreement concluded with Ukraine. Notably, exactly the same share of Ukrainian citizens believe that the Kremlin intends to use a 'peace agreement' merely as a pause before a renewed attack (→ Re:Russia: Peace on The Aggressor's Terms).\n\nAttitudes in December 2024 were shaped by Trump’s campaign rhetoric, in which he claimed that he would miraculously end the war in Ukraine as soon as he became president. To some extent, these promises appealed even to Democrats, among whom support for Ukraine also weakened at that time. Since then, however, the war has continued for another year, while the absence of US assistance has worsened Ukraine’s position. Moreover, Trump has failed to change Americans’ views of Vladimir Putin, who continues to appear in their eyes as an unprincipled and untrustworthy aggressor. In an October survey by the New York based Institute for Global Affairs, published under the title ‘The Reckless Peacemaker’, 42% of those surveyed said that Trump’s actions had worsened the situation surrounding the Russia–Ukraine war, while only 23% believed they had improved it. The same share, 23%, think that President Trump deserves the Nobel Peace Prize, whereas almost two thirds of Americans believe that he does not.\n\nA major survey on national security issues conducted by the Ronald Reagan Institute in late October and early November clearly demonstrates the pro Ukrainian orientation of American public opinion. A majority, 62%, want Ukraine to win the war, while 11% would prefer a Russian victory. Unlike Trump, 75% of Americans view Ukraine as an ally, while Russia tops the list of US 'enemies', a label applied by 79% of those surveyed, ahead of China at 76% and Iran at 77%. The views of MAGA Republicans do not differ dramatically from the national average, with 73% considering Ukraine an ally and 74% viewing Russia as an adversary.\n\nTwo-thirds of those surveyed by the Reagan Institute support the supply of US weapons to Ukraine, which is 9 percentage points higher than last year. Among Republicans, support has increased by 15 percentage points to 59%, while among the most pro Trump respondents it has risen by as much as 20 percentage points to 62%. Support among independents remains the lowest at 53%, but is also increasing by 5 percentage points. Two thirds of all those surveyed, 65%, support sending Ukraine long range cruise missiles such as Tomahawks with permission to strike targets on Russian territory, and 69% support providing Ukraine with US backed security guarantees similar to NATO Article 5.\n\nIn the Reagan Institute survey, American attitudes appear perhaps at their most Reaganite, that is, consistently pro Ukrainian and anti Russian. This may partly reflect the broader framing of the survey, which was entirely focused on US security and geopolitical positioning and may have primed respondents accordingly. Overall, however, the findings suggest that the relativism and eclecticism of Trump’s foreign policy orientation, often described as transactionalism, have not yet undermined the core framework of traditional priorities and value based reference points of US foreign policy doctrine as understood by the average American. A total of 68% of those surveyed view NATO favourably, and 76% support adherence to the Alliance’s Article 5 commitments.\n\nThe latest online survey by The Economist/YouGov, conducted at the turn of November and December, reflects public reactions to the latest peacemaking efforts by the US administration and presents a more nuanced picture that nevertheless remains unfavourable to Trump. Some 42% of those surveyed believe that Trump is more likely to side with Russia, only 12% hold the opposite view, and 22% think that Trump maintains a neutral position. Around 30% of Americans say they are reasonably familiar with the substance of his administration’s peace proposals, while a further 28% know something about them. Overall, 33% tend to approve of Trump’s strategy on Ukraine, which broadly aligns with Gallup figures, while 46% tend to disapprove.\n\nWhen respondents were informed about the details of the Trump–Witkoff peace plan, including consent to reductions in the size of the Ukrainian armed forces, the transfer of Donbas to Russia, a ban on NATO membership, and a prohibition on deploying Alliance forces in Ukraine, their attitudes became more negative. Among those unfamiliar with the details, the net balance of approval for the 'peace plan' stood at minus 10 percentage points, while among those who learned its specifics it fell to minus 17. Independents, although generally negative about the plan, became slightly less critical after learning the details, with the net balance shifting from minus 25 to minus 18. By contrast, support among Republicans dropped sharply from 57 to 38% after exposure to the plan’s content. This experiment suggests that as the negative consequences of an unreliable agreement that is more favourable to Russia become increasingly apparent, American society is likely to place responsibility for them on Donald Trump.\n\nA majority of people surveyed by the Economist/YouGov, 56%, believe that the war in Ukraine is directly related to US national security, while 26% take the opposite, essentially isolationist view, and a further 17% are unsure. Among younger respondents under 30, Republicans, and those who voted for Trump, the share of isolationists who see the conflict as distant and irrelevant to the United States is higher, but remains below one third. These distributions also indicate that Americans’ foreign policy views are far less susceptible to Trump’s supposedly 'revolutionary' relativism in international affairs than is sometimes assumed.",

    "description": "As you might know, I'm a bit riding on the nostalgia train curr...",
    "fullText": "As you might know, I'm a bit riding on the nostalgia train currently. That has led to the creation of a CS 1.6 Retroboard and playing CS:CZ occassionally. \r\nThen I told myself \"Why not check out some old code stuff for the GoldSrc engine?\". And so I did. \r\nI decided to go for my server-side hackbase, because it's the most easy part to verify its functionality, and you can also make some very funny stuff. It's very cool to see that this hackbase still works, given that it dates back to somewhere around 2014.\r\nAnd suddenly, after installing the hackbase successfully, I got struck by a flash of nostalgia! So, I hyperfocused on creating a new server hack based on the hackbase. I added a good deal of functions, improved certain parts of the hackbase and fixed some annoying bugs. The result can be seen in the following video:\r\n<div>\r\n<hr/>\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"/clips/apocserv-trailer.mp4\" title=\"Video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" referrerpolicy=\"strict-origin-when-cross-origin\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n<small>It's fun to toy around</small>\r\n<hr/>\r\n</div>\r\nI have to say, even tho the GoldSrc engine dates back to 1998, it's SO enjoyable to work with it. I mean, you can accomplish various cool and funny stuff pretty easy. Of course, I'm a senior software developer, but I find the engine to be with a very low entrance barrier. It's actually sad to see how old it is, no one really cares anymore. But I also realize how strongly it influenced me when I created my own games (or my client-server chat system).\r\n<div>\r\n<hr/>\r\n<code class=\"hljs language-cpp\">\r\n//======================================================================\r\nEXPORT_LIBRARY int NEWAPI GetNewDLLFunctions(NEW_DLL_FUNCTIONS *pNewFunctionTable, int*pinterfaceVersion)\r\n{\r\n //Called to recieve NEW_DLL_FUNCTIONS and Interface version pointers from engine\r\n if (!pNewFunctionTable) return 0;\r\n //Get address and call it from original module\r\n #ifdef __linux__\r\n orig_GetNewDLLFunctions = (T_GetNewDLLFunctions)dlsym(hOrigModule, \"GetNewDLLFunctions\");\r\n #else\r\n orig_GetNewDLLFunctions = (T_GetNewDLLFunctions)GetProcAddress((HMODULE)g_hOrigModule, \"GetNewDLLFunctions\");\r\n #endif\r\n //Initialize hooking\r\n gNewDllTable.Initialize(pNewFunctionTable, sizeof(NEW_DLL_FUNCTIONS));\r\n //Register aliases\r\n for (unsigned int i = 0; i < sizeof(paNewDllFuncs) / sizeof(unsigned int); i++)\r\n gNewDllTable.AddNewName(paNewDllFuncs[i], i);\r\n return orig_GetNewDLLFunctions(pNewFunctionTable, pinterfaceVersion);\r\n}\r\n//======================================================================\r\n</code>\r\n<small>An example of a server game dll function hook</small>\r\n<hr/>\r\n</div>\r\nNo wonder that the GoldSrc engine sparked an outstanding amount of modding possibilities! Game mods, maps, scripts, sprites, models... Back in the day, modding was an essential part of videogames. Almost all modern games can't claim this, with the exception of a few ones (like Minecraft).\r\n<div>\r\n<hr/>\r\n<code class=\"hljs language-cpp\">\r\n//======================================================================\r\nedict_s* SpawnEntity(const char* szClassName, float* pos)\r\n{\r\n //Spawn an entity\r\n if ((szClassName) && (pos)) {\r\n int ialloc = g_pEngFuncs->pfnAllocString(szClassName); //Allocate entity string\r\n if (ialloc) {\r\n edict_s* pEntity = g_pEngFuncs->pfnCreateNamedEntity(ialloc); //Create the entity by name\r\n if (pEntity) {\r\n g_pDllFuncs->pfnSpawn(pEntity); //Spawn item to world\r\n g_pEngFuncs->pfnSetOrigin(pEntity, pos); //Set desired position\r\n return pEntity;\r\n }\r\n }\r\n }\r\n return NULL;\r\n}\r\n//======================================================================\r\n</code>\r\n<small>Easy entity creation</small>\r\n<hr/>\r\n</div>\r\nIn conclusion, even tho the game engine is definitely past its prime, it was worth unlocking these core memories and re-create a server-side hack for GoldSrc CS/CZ. I had a lot of fun, I remembered all the good things from back then, and I enjoyed toying around with the project in production.\r\nSo, if you want to check the project out, feel free to view it on GitHub. It's open-sourced under the MIT license.

    "description": "Initiative aims to identify proficient gamers and coders who can help companies identify flaws in their cybersecurity",
    "fullText": "Initiative aims to identify proficient gamers and coders who can help companies identify flaws in their cybersecurity\n\nCybercriminals, the shadowy online figures often depicted in Hollywood movies as hooded villains capable of wiping millions of pounds off the value of businesses at a keystroke, are not usually known for their candour.\n\nBut in a sixth-form college in Manchester this week, two former hackers gave the young people gathered an honest appraisal of what living a life of internet crime really looks like.\n\nThe teenagers in the room are listening intently, but the day-to-day internecine disputes they hear about is not the stuff of screenplays.\n\n“It’s just people getting into these online dramas and they’re swatting and doxing each other and getting people to throw bricks through their windows,” one of the hackers says.\n\nIf the language sounds unfamiliar, it should – “swatting” and “doxing” involve people outing each other online by posting their genuine identities – but their message is clear: though cybercrime may seem alluring, the reality is anything but.\n\nThe hackers are former members of a sprawling cybercrime ecosystem dubbed “The Com”, and they’re here for a very particular reason – to urge talented teenagers to use their gaming and coding skills for the good.\n\nThe talk is part of an initiative backed by the Co-op, which suffered a debilitating hack in April last year. The retailer has teamed up with The Hacking Games, a startup that identifies talented gamers to test companies’ IT systems, which wants youngsters to use their skills to help companies fight back against criminal hackers.\n\nConor Freeman, 26, from Dublin, was jailed for just under three years in 2020 for his role in a $2m cryptocurrency theft and spoke to students at Connell Co-op College near Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium last week.\n\nFreeman became a part of the Com – short for “community” – after being groomed online by an older teenager while playing Minecraft. The association spiralled into attending hacking forums on the dark web and eventually hacking people’s crypto wallets along with other Com members.\n\n“I stumbled on these various different dark-net hacking forums and that’s when things really started to escalate,” he says. “I just fell into these different communities, different groups, befriended a couple of different people, and then found myself involved with large-scale cryptocurrency theft.”\n\nFreeman served 11 months of his sentence and is now employed by The Hacking Games as an ethical hacker.\n\nFergus Hay, co-founder and chief executive of The Hacking Games, said there was a “100% overlap” between gaming and hacking. Describing gaming as a “live laboratory for skills development”, Hay said skills learned in gaming – particularly “modding” or creating software that helps you alter a video game – can be used in either hacking or cybersecurity.\n\n“And the people who’ve worked that out are the bad guys,” says Hay. He adds: “So what you’ve got is a whole generation of natural-born hackers who’ve got incredible aptitude, but they’re invisible. No one’s seen their skill sets because they aren’t advertised on LinkedIn.”\n\nHay’s company has designed an AI-powered test to identify skills among proficient gamers who could make the jump to cybersecurity and help companies detect flaws in their IT systems via “red teaming” – or ethical hacking – where their networks are subjected to attacks by expert computer users.\n\nFreeman was joined via video link by Ricky Handschumacher, a 30-year-old US citizen who was part of the same crypto heist and served four years in prison for the crime. The talk at Connell College was the first time Freeman and Handschumacher had ever seen each other physically. Handschumacher, who also fell into the Com via gaming, told the audience that he would have taken a different path had he known that you could be “paid a lot of money to do the right thing”.\n\nComputing students who attended the talk said they had been inspired.\n\n“The lesson is there’s great opportunities for you to go into computing, but you have to be watchful of what you’re doing because if you do something wrong, it will quickly harm your future,” said Suheil, 17.\n\nRob Elsey, the Co-op group’s chief digital officer, who led the organisation’s fight back against a ransomware hack that cost £120m in lost profits, said the talks were about “helping young people recognise that the digital skills they already have can be a force for good, protecting people, organisations and communities rather than being misused or exploited”.\n\nThe Co-op is planning more Hacking Games talks across its 38 school academies this year.\n\nIn July last year four people including three teenagers were arrested at addresses in the West Midlands, Staffordshire and London as part of an investigation into a trio of cyber-attacks on the Co-op, Marks & Spencer and Harrods.",

    "fullText": "Wine-Staging 11.2 Brings More Patches To Help Adobe Photoshop On Linux\n\nBuilding off Friday's release of Wine 11.2 is now Wine-Staging 11.2 as this experimental/testing version of Wine with hundreds of extra patches that have yet to be introduced in upstream proper for this open-source software enabling Windows games and applications on Linux. Notable in this bi-weekly update are more patches for continuing to improve the Adobe Photoshop installer support on Linux.\r\nRecently there were patches posted for getting the Adobe Photoshop 2025 installer working on Linux. The installer works with the patches and the app subsequently works too under Wine. Those patches have yet to be upstreamed but were merged into Wine-Staging 11.1. With Wine-Staging 11.2 are now more patches in this crusade for a nice Adobe Photoshop / Adobe Creative Cloud experience on Linux.\r\nWine-Staging 11.2 released this morning with more patches intended to help the Adobe software on Linux plus other software likely stands to benefit too. There is now an IXMLSerializer implementation for MSHTML and allowing embedded XML declarations inside elements for the xml2 code. This complements the earlier code in Wine-Staging 11.1 around MSHTML3 and MSXML3.\r\nThis Wine merge request is what's tracking these patches for working to get into the upstream Wine codebase.\r\nToday's Wine-Staging 11.2 release also pulls in the very latest VKD3D code as well as drops a number of outdated patches. In particular, patches that conflict with the PE/Unix split that will cause a number of patches to be rewritten. One of the dropped patches that may impact users is the removal of the \"NVCUDA\" CUDA support:\r\n\"While this patch set has known users, it has been disabled for quite some time due to the PE/Unix split. It would need to be rewritten effectively from scratch.\r\nTo make matters worse, at this point this can't even happen. nvcuda has some private undocumented interfaces that cannot simply be trivially passed through; they would require knowledge of the types in order to allow for wow64 translation, which would be a requirement for upstreaming.\r\nWe need coöperation from NVidia to get CUDA upstream. NVidia employees have been made aware of this problem, but so far the company has not provided us with the necessary documentation.\"\r\nOther dropped patches were already disabled for years or had other issues with the latest upstream code.\n\n Add A Comment",

    "description": "A Cardiff University researcher recreated her own voice using a deathbot - but found it strange.",
    "fullText": "If a loved-one died tomorrow, would you want to keep talking to them?\n\nNot through memories or saved messages, but through artificial intelligence - a chatbot that uses their texts, emails and voice notes, to reply in their tone and style.\n\nA growing number of technology companies now offer such services as part of the \"digital afterlife\" industry, which is worth more than £100bn, with some people using it as a way to deal with their grief.\n\nCardiff University's Dr Jenny Kidd has led research on so-called deathbots, published in the Cambridge University Press journal Memory, Mind and Media, and described the results as both \"fascinating and unsettling\".\n\nAttempts to communicate with the dead are not new.\n\nFrom séances to spiritualist mediums, similar practices have existed for centuries.\n\nBut as technology advances, AI has the potential to make them more convincing, and far more scalable.\n\nIn 2024, James Vlahos told the BBC how he recorded his dad's voice and created an AI chatbot after hearing the devastating news that he was dying from cancer.\n\nHe described how wonderful it was to keep a sense of his memory alive, and while it didn't remove the pain of his death, he added: \"I have this wonderful interactive compendium I can turn to.\"\n\nThe Workplace Bereavement support group said it was not seeing widespread use of deathbots, but more curiosity from people.\n\n\"These deathbots and AI tools are only as good as the information they are given,\" said founder Jacqueline Gunn.\n\n\"They don't grow or adapt in the way grief does. For some they may offer a stepping stone, but they cannot be the destination.\n\n\"Grief is a deeply personal human response to death, needing time, understanding and human connection.\"\n\nWorking with Eva Nieto McAvoy from King's College London and Bethan Jones from Cardiff University, Kidd explored how these technologies function in practice.\n\nThey looked into how AI systems are designed to imitate the voices, speech patterns and personalities of people who have died, using their digital traces.\n\nWhile they are often marketed as sources of comfort and connection, the researchers say they rely on a simplified understanding of memory, identity and relationships.\n\nKidd's interest in the topic began during the Covid pandemic, when there was a sudden flood of AI-generated animated photographs on social media.\n\nPeople were uploading old photographs of ancestors, then watching them blink, smile and move their heads as software \"reanimated\" their loved ones.\n\n\"These things were really creepy, but really quite interesting as well,\" Kidd said.\n\n\"All of a sudden they were everywhere and millions of people were sharing them.\n\n\"That was us stumbling into this kind of work of AI revival.\"\n\nThe team decided to test some of the deathbots for themselves and explored four commercial platforms.\n\n\"It was weird interacting with ourselves in that way but largely unsatisfying because of the technical limitations of these platforms at the moment,\" said Kidd.\n\nIn one experiment, Kidd used her own voice data to create a chatbot.\n\n\"It didn't sound like me, in fact it it sounded quite Australian,\" she added.\n\nKidd believes the technology will improve, but she is sceptical about whether a large market will emerge.\n\n\"We already have a lot of established rituals and traditions around death,\" she said.\n\n\"The fact that there hasn't really been a take-off technology in this space maybe indicates there isn't much of a market for it.\"\n\nWhen asked whether they would want their own families to recreate them digitally after death, the researchers had mixed feelings.\n\n\"My initial gut reaction is if they want to do that and it's kind of playful, that's fine,\" Kidd said.\n\n\"But if there's any sense to which, certainly in the future, the persona continues to evolve or says things that I would never say, or has allegiances I would never have, and this begins to mangle people's actual recollections of me and my values then I think I would have a big problem.\"\n\nDr Nieto McAvoy said she was not \"particularly bothered\".\n\n\"I'm not very religious and I don't have strong thoughts about the afterlife, once I'm dead, who cares?\n\n\"If it helps them, you know... but it can be misconstrued for sure. And do I want my family to pay for a service... I don't know, it's complex.\"",

    "description": "Sprinkles' abrupt closure at the end of 2025 marked the end of the cupcake era. Now, bundt cakes and cookies are vying for the top sweet spot.",
    "fullText": "The cupcake boom, a twenty-year dessert trend that once captivated the nation, ended with a thunk. However, America's sweet tooth doesn't retire — it just hunts for its next obsession.\n\nWhen all of Sprinkles' stores abruptly closed at the end of 2025, a curtain dropped on an era. Not because the dessert chain, cofounded by pastry chef and entrepreneur Candace Nelson in 2005, was the biggest, but because it was the name-brand symbol of the nation's cupcake years.\n\nTiming matters. As restaurant chains face higher costs and more cautious consumers who have less patience for one-note indulgences, the sudden disappearance of a once-dominant dessert brand underscores how little room there is for concepts that don't necessarily drive frequent repeat visits.\n\nAsit Sharma, a senior investing analyst at The Motley Fool, put it bluntly: \"Sprinkles Cupcakes just punched way beyond its weight in the public imagination than it ever did on the ground.\"\n\nAt its peak, Sprinkles had fewer than 100 stores, and yet, Sharma added, the brand got a lot of great press and \"sometimes the perception is larger than the business.\"\n\nSprinkles is credited with being the world's first cupcake-only bakery, helping to popularize the craze that spawned dozens, if not hundreds, of copycats. Nelson, the founder, served as a permanent judge on the Food Network show \"Cupcake Wars,\" further elevating her brand's status — and cementing her version of the handheld treats as the gold standard.\n\nStill, the closure of Sprinkles, Sharma argued, wasn't shocking, since Nelson had sold her stake in the company to the private equity firm KarpReilly LLC in 2012.\n\n\"We know that expansion isn't always the first priority of a private equity firm when it takes over a chain; profits are, so that's not surprising,\" Sharma said.\n\nThe bigger takeaway for him wasn't just ownership — it was the cyclical fate of dessert fads.\n\n\"Dessert chains in particular are really prone to fads — frozen yogurt is a perfect example,\" Jonathan Maze, editor in chief of Restaurant Business, said.\n\n\"We've had two frozen yogurt booms, one in the 80s and 90s, and then one coming out of the Great Recession,\" Maze added. In the boom phase, he said, \"You just get a lot of copycat concepts. They franchise. They start aggressively selling these locations.\"\n\nThen the market turns, consumers move on to something else, and as quickly as they came, \"they start declining.\" Gourmet doughnuts followed a similar trajectory in the late 2000s before cupcakes gained steam.\n\nThe cupcake trend, Maze said, although once promising, in part due to its early, pre-social media, viral appeal, \"just didn't quite have the legs that people thought it did — but that happens fairly routinely.\"\n\nDessert spending remains significant. The $143.63 billion sweets market is projected to reach $193.56 billion by 2030, according to Research and Markets.\n\nIf Sprinkles' closing is a symbolic endpoint, the obvious question is what fills the gap. That question carries new weight in a tighter economy, where consumers are increasingly choosy about when — and how often — they treat themselves.\n\nSharma's immediate answer: \"I think it's got to be the international bakery craze.\" He described noticing both Korean and Vietnamese concepts start to crop up across both coasts — with brands like Paris Baguette, 85°C Bakery Cafe, and Tous les Jours trending online and growing their footprints nationwide.\n\nNothing Bundt Cakes also shows promise as a contender to become the next \"it\" sweet after years of being a quiet hit. Maze described the Nothing Bundt Cakes as \"one of the best-performing and most consistent restaurant chains in the country,\" having steadily grown to over 700 locations since its 1997 founding.\n\nThe company, which had the most positive review sentiment for quality and taste of all food brands on Yelp's \"Most Loved Brands of 2025\" list, is on track to open 1,000 units by 2027.\n\nMaze, meanwhile, thinks cookies have an advantage that cupcakes and fro-yo never fully did: they're an everyday treat that doesn't require a dedicated occasion to enjoy. That accessibility has led to names like Crumbl, Insomnia Cookies, and Levain Bakery gaining momentum quickly.\n\n\"Cookies are actually pretty fascinating, to be perfectly honest,\" Maze said. The format, he argued, can be resilient, and crucially, \"it's not a major investment to get yourself a cookie.\"\n\nHe also credited Insomnia Cookies' model for creating specific demand after the brand designed its own occasion — late-night cookie cravings — and answered the make-or-break question for any specialty dessert chain: how often will customers really show up?\n\n\"The biggest challenge with that sector by a long shot is that you only get a Blizzard or doughnuts so often,\" Maze said.\n\nThat constraint — how often people realistically want dessert — is what ultimately determines which chains endure and which burn out. When too many concepts flood the market offering the same product for the same narrow occasion, the model goes stale, no matter how beloved the brand once was.\n\nThat dynamic is what doomed frozen yogurt, dulled the cupcake boom, and now leaves the dessert category in a moment of reshuffling, as chains chase recipes that feel special enough to justify the splurge in a stretched economy. What comes next — cookies, international bakeries, bundt cakes, or something still incubating on TikTok — will face the same test.",

    "description": "\"I don't see any other way than working up until my last day,\" Jordan Hendrickson, who has over $500,000 in student loans, said.",
    "fullText": "For some, retirement means relaxation. For Jordan Hendrickson, retirement means debt.\n\n\"I don't have any retirement savings,\" Hendrickson, 54, told Business Insider. \"I don't see any other way than working up until my last day.\"\n\nHendrickson received her doctorate in psychology in 2013, bringing her total student-loan balance to about $350,000, including what she borrowed for her bachelor's and master's degrees. While she qualified for Pell Grants, which are awarded to low-income students, Hendrickson turned to federal loans to help cover the remaining costs.\n\nShe now works two jobs, as a telehealth provider for a mental health company and on the mobile support team for her county. The latter qualifies her for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which forgives student debt for government and nonprofit workers after 10 years of qualifying payments.\n\nWhile Hendrickson is about halfway through her PSLF payments, she's worried federal changes to student loans — including President Donald Trump's plans to narrow eligibility for PSLF — could leave her paying off her debt, which now stands at just over $500,000, for decades to come.\n\n\"I don't know what's going to happen with this. I think that's my biggest anxiety, is the uncertainty,\" Hendrickson said. \"I would like to plan for retirement, but I don't see a path forward right now, given that debt.\"\n\nBusiness Insider has previously spoken to student-loan borrowers who have said they're postponing retirement, or are struggling in retirement, due to their student-debt loads. This year's looming changes to the federal lending landscape are adding additional stress. Trump's administration will begin implementing repayment changes this summer, including new repayment plans and a new rule that would limit PSLF eligibility.\n\nWhile Hendrickson said she doesn't regret taking out student loans for her education, she wishes there were more certainty for her and other borrowers' repayment outlooks.\n\n\"The education I got was really good. I really love what I do. I do work 70 hours a week, but there's a meaning in that work,\" Hendrickson said. \"I wouldn't change it. I just wish it wasn't like this.\"\n\nWhile Hendrickson isn't sure if she'll retire, Amye Cooley, 85, is already retired — but has just over $60,000 in student loan debt weighing her down.\n\nAfter a divorce, Cooley returned to school in 1978, hoping it would help her earn more money to take care of her family. She took out about $25,000 in student loans for her bachelor's degree, but upon graduating, she was unable to find a job, so she put her loans into forbearance.\n\nShe began working as a paraprofessional in her school district in 1984, earned her teaching certification, and taught for about 15 years before retiring from her full-time job in 2010 and switching to part-time tutoring. However, she's not enjoying the peace she had hoped for because of her student loans.\n\n\"I could have new rugs put in. I could have new windows put in. I could have some work done on my car. I could stop worrying about them garnishing my Social Security,\" Cooley said. \"There's a whole lot of things I could do, but I have these student loans.\"\n\nWhile Cooley is current on her student loans, she relies on Social Security and a teacher's pension to stay afloat and is worried that her federal benefits could be seized should she fall behind on her payments. The Department of Education announced in January that it was pausing wage garnishments and tax refund seizures, but did not specify when the pause would lift.\n\nSimilar to Cooley, Grace, 67, pursued her bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology to make more money. Her balance now stands at $232,000, and despite making payments for over 25 years as required for forgiveness under income-driven repayment plans, she said she's been unable to get an answer on whether she qualifies for relief.\n\nShe's now retired, and she said the anxiety with regard to her payment outlook is overwhelming — especially because, should she qualify for forgiveness this year, it could be accompanied by thousands of dollars in taxes. A 2021 provision in the American Rescue Plan that made student-loan forgiveness tax-free expired at the end of 2025, and the Trump administration has given no indication that it will be renewed.\n\nWith major federal repayment changes looming, though, the administration said it's acting in borrowers' best interests to curb excessive borrowing and simplify a complex student-loan system. Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent said in a statement last year that the repayment changes \"will benefit borrowers who will no longer be pushed into insurmountable debt to finance degrees that do not pay off.\"\n\nThose improvements are coming too late for Cooley, who said her life— and retirement — was altered the moment she chose to take out student loans.\n\n\"I went back to school to give my kids a better life,\" Cooley said. \"And now 41 years later, I'm still paying this off. It's made a hell of a difference in my life.\"",

    "description": "Trump promised Americans higher tax refunds this year, but staffing cuts at the IRS could lead to customer service delays.",
    "fullText": "Average tax refunds this year are set to be nearly $750 higher than last year — but they might take a while getting to you, with a smaller IRS dedicated to getting them out.\n\nThe passage of President Donald Trump's \"One Big Beautiful Bill\" introduced new sweeping tax measures — which include no tax on overtime or tips and an expanded child tax credit — that will show up in many taxpayers' refunds this filing season.\n\nThe average tax refund is set to grow to $3,800 from the 2024 tax year's $3,052, according to the Tax Foundation. That's because the IRS hasn't directed employers to adjust how much they're withholding from workers' paychecks, meaning that the new tax provisions will show up instead in refunds.\n\nThere's just one problem: A much smaller IRS will be grinding away to get those checks to filers. The IRS's workforce shrank by 27% from January 2025 to December 2025, going from over 102,000 workers to around 74,000, according to National Taxpayer Advocate Erin Collins' annual report. Per that report, 22% of the agency's customer representatives left.\n\n\"The impact of these departures is not merely numeric,\" Collins' report said. \"Many departing employees were experienced workers whose institutional knowledge and technical expertise cannot easily be replaced.\"\n\nThe agency experienced significant cuts at the hands of DOGE as part of the unofficial office's goal to slash the government workforce. Employees at the agency previously told Business Insider when those cuts were underway that Americans could experience strained customer service and challenges with tax refunds, and those issues likely won't go away this tax season.\n\n\"Over the last couple of years, there has been a lot of disruption associated with the agency,\" Garrett Watson, the director of policy analysis at the Tax Foundation, told Business Insider. Watson said the warnings from the National Taxpayer Advocate \"showcase the risk the agency faces this tax season,\" alongside concerns from IRS workers over staffing reshuffles.\n\nA current IRS employee said that while it's too soon to tell how tax filing services will be affected, they anticipate that limited staff will slow things down — especially after a report that IRS employees from different departments who are not tax experts could be brought in to help. The employee said that those workers would have to be trained on the filing process, and that takes time, which could translate to delays on the customer's end.\n\n\"This may lead to lower quality service for taxpayers who reach out and a higher risk of errors on returns processed or corrected by the agency, as agents with less experience may struggle to address more complicated tax matters,\" Watson said.\n\nThe potential strains come as filers no longer have access to the IRS's now-shuttered Direct File program, the agency's in-house pilot software that allowed taxpayers to file more seamlessly for free. That program had garnered high satisfaction ratings, though only a small sliver of taxpayers used it before the Trump administration pulled the plug.\n\nIt also comes after what Collins described as the \"direct and lasting consequences\" of the IRS's pandemic-era challenges, when the cash-strapped agency was tasked with delivering economic relief, processing refunds, and working through an abrupt transition into remote work — all of which led to a backlog in processing refunds and IRS offices piled high with paper.\n\nThe IRS and Treasury Department did not respond to a request for comment. In a press release marking the start of filing season, Treasury Secretary and acting IRS commissioner Scott Bessent said that \"President Trump is committed to the taxpayers of this country and improving upon the successful tax filing season in 2025.\"\n\n\"Prior to the passage of the One, Big, Beautiful Bill, which delivered working families tax cuts, Treasury and IRS were diligently preparing to update forms and processes for the benefit of hardworking Americans, and I am confident in our ability to deliver results and drive growth for businesses and consumers alike,\" Bessent said.\n\n\"It's still early in filing season, and so far I'm not aware of any systemic problems. But there are vulnerabilities when you combine a rollout of new and technically complex provisions with staff reductions,\" Danny Werfel, who served as the IRS commissioner until January 2025, said. There are some \"good signs\" in his view — such as guidance on measures like tips, overtime, and vehicle-related credits already being issued.\n\n\"However, applying that guidance in real-world situations has historically led to more phone calls to the IRS,\" Werfel said. \"For example, when verifying a vehicle meets US assembly requirements, the taxpayer or preparer may seek IRS phone support. So service quality on phone lines is where rubber will hit the road.\"",

    "title": "The rulebook that limited US and Russian nukes has fallen apart. Both sides could revert to worst-case scenario planning, experts warn.",
    "description": "Without the verification and communication processes of New START, the US and Russia will have less assurance about each other's nuclear postures.",
    "fullText": "The 15-year agreement restraining the US and Russia's nuclear arsenals is no more, opening the door for distrust that could raise the risk of miscalculation, arms control experts say.\n\nThe expiration of the New START treaty this week, which capped the amount of nuclear warheads that the two sides could deploy on bombers, submarines, and missiles, will reduce the degree of transparency between Washington and Moscow at a moment of high tension in Europe. Without the verification processes and formal exchanges, like site visits, defense planners will find themselves in the dark.\n\n\"That is very likely going to cause both the US and Russia to revert back to worst-case scenario assumptions about each other's actions,\" Mackenzie Knight-Boyle, a senior research associate with the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists, told Business Insider.\n\nNew START, signed in 2010 and officially enacted in 2011, was the latest in a series of nuclear arms deals between the US and Russia. It's the first time in decades that neither countries has abided by an agreement to limit the number of operational nuclear warheads. In the New START era, Washington and Moscow could deploy up to 1,550 warheads and 700 launchers.\n\nThe agreement also imposed a system for both sides to verify each other's actions. The US and Russia would notify one another when they moved a nuclear weapon, and sent inspectors to nuclear sites like missile, bomber, and submarine bases. Experts called the New START process robust and informative, building confidence that the two nuclear powers were following their agreement.\n\nWithout it, there's a \"sense of less predictability and transparency between the two nations,\" Eliana Johns, a senior research associate with the Nuclear Information Project at FAS, told Business Insider. The verification process provided detailed information about nuclear activities, including exercises and storage sites, down to specifics like how many B-52 Stratofortress bombers were equipped to carry nuclear weapons, she added.\n\nThe US and Russia are far and away the countries with the largest nuclear arsenals, even decades after the Cold War. China's rapid build-up of its nuclear arsenal has worried American leaders, despite its pledge not to use nukes first in a war.\n\nNow, the predictability brought by New START is gone. Without limitations, nuclear forces like intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarines could be increased in ways that risk a Cold War-like arms race. Right now, all of the US' deployed ICBMs only carry one, but around half have Mk21A reentry vehicles that could carry three. Planning and posturing will be filled with more unknowns, and defense officials on both sides will be making assumptions in assessing risks.\n\nAccording to Knight-Boyle, Johns, and FAS Nuclear Information Project associate director Matt Korda and director Hans Kristensen, it's possible the US ICBM force could double from 400 warheads to 800 with uploaded reserve warheads. Increasing the warhead count for submarines could be faster and could add upwards of 800 to 900 warheads. The quickest ramp-up involves configuring B-2 Spirit bombers and B-52s to carry more bombs, and there are estimates of up to 800 nuclear weapons available to these aircraft.\n\nThis doesn't mean the US and Russia will immediately begin to take these actions, though. Uploading warheads would require significant resources, logistics planning, and time, could enflame tensions, and would raise vulnerability concerns. But both countries have \"significant warhead upload capacity that would allow them to increase their deployed nuclear forces relatively quickly,\" the arms control experts wrote this week.\n\nNew START was only intended to be in place for a decade with the option of a five-year extension, which the US and Russia agreed to in 2021. The following year, Russia invaded Ukraine, and in 2023, Russia suspended its participation but said it would still follow numerical limits. This meant the exchange of data, notifications, and information was halted. The US followed suit.\n\nRussia has offered to observe those caps for another year. And on the day the agreement expired, Axios reported that there were negotiations for both countries to follow New START's limitations, but whether that deal would include verification processes is unknown. When asked whether there was a temporary agreement after the treaty's expiration, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters, \"not to my knowledge.\"\n\nIn the absence of New START, experts are concerned mistrust and assumptions could lead nuclear powers to increase their arsenal. \"And that creates a domino effect where if the US uploads warheads for fear of Russia's actions, Russia does it reciprocally,\" Knight-Boyle said. Other nuclear states, like China, must also be considered in that possibility.\n\nChina's nuclear arsenal has been the focus of officials in Washington in light of New START's expiration. President Donald Trump and other administration officials have said future nuclear arms deals must incorporate China due to its rapidly growing nuclear force. Per Pentagon estimates, Beijing's arsenal is expected to top 1,000 warheads by 2030.\n\n\"The president's been clear in the past that in order to have true arms control in the 21st century, it's impossible to do something without China,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said this week. Washington also accused Beijing of conducting nuclear explosive tests, including one in 2020, which violates an international ban.\n\nIn response to a question about China's role in a potential future nuclear arms deal, Lin Jian, a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry, said, \"China's nuclear strength is by no means at the same level with that of the US or Russia. Thus, China will not take part in nuclear disarmament negotiations for the time-being.\"",

    "title": "Tesla says its cars should drive themselves as humans do. Waymo says the bar is higher.",
    "description": "Tesla says cars can drive themselves with only cameras just like humans drive with their eyes. A Waymo exec disagrees with the comparison.",
    "fullText": "If people can drive with their eyes, can an AI drive only with cameras?\n\nTesla leans on that analogy to defend its hotly debated cameras-only approach to autonomous cars.\n\n\"It should be solved with cameras just like how every other human or animal lives around this world,\" Ashok Elluswamy, Tesla's vice president of AI, said at the ScaledML Conference on January 29. \"Self-driving problem is thought of as a sensor problem. It's actually not a sensor problem, it's an AI problem.\"\n\nAlphabet's Waymo has a fundamentally different engineering approach to autonomy. Srikanth Thirumalai, Waymo's vice president of onboard software, pushed back on Elluswamy's comparison.\n\n\"I think the bar is higher than human driving,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe contrast between Waymo and Tesla goes beyond philosophy and is built into the hardware.\n\nTesla wants to reach autonomy with fewer than 10 cameras and an AI trained on billions of miles of real-world driving data. Waymo also relies on AI, but is paired with a multi-sensor system — 29 cameras, five lidars, and six radars — to give the AI driver different ways to perceive an environment. The Alphabet company has so far deployed about 2,500 robotaxis across multiple US cities.\n\nThe debate often boils down to cost and safety: More sensors could increase costs, which could be a barrier to scale. Fewer sensors could present safety challenges, some say, which is another constraint for mass robotaxi adoption.\n\nThirumalai manages a team of more than 600 people building Waymo's AI driver software. During a rare interview at Waymo's HQ, which spans multiple buildings, the vice president told Business Insider he expects the sensor suite to shrink over time as the hardware improves and gets cheaper. But he framed the lidar or no-lidar debate as a distraction from the company's safety-oriented objective.\n\n\"Given where the technology is right now, the question is what is it going to take for that product to be safe?\" he said. \"So you work backwards from that safety bar and say, 'What does it take to build a safe product?' And then keep pushing and iterating and innovating to reduce the cost of the sensors, and to improve the quality of the software and how it uses the sensors.\"\n\nThe soft-spoken Thirumalai looked to the future and explained his position.\n\n\"In three to five years, will our sensor stack look different than it is right now? Absolutely.\"\n\nWaymo has previously said it expects the next generation of robotaxis to have fewer sensors: 13 cameras, four lidars, and six radars. A Waymo spokesperson previously told Business Insider that the company expects to serve public riders by late 2026.\n\nA Tesla spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nHumans can be bad drivers. They're easily distracted, swayed by emotions, and can be slow to make the right decisions. Leaders in autonomy will say they're driven by a mission to build something safer than humans. The challenge is defining what \"safer\" means in a way that regulators, riders, and engineers can measure.\n\n\"This notion of what the bar is is a very important question,\" Thirumalai said. \"And one that we have only refined over the years, and in some cases, we're still sort of discovering what the bar is.\"\n\nInstead of an arbitrary goalpost that says robots will be multiple times safer than a human driver, Thirumalai said Waymo looks at individual driving cases and assesses how often those events can occur.\n\n\"We break it down and say, 'Well, how often do those events actually occur per million miles of driving? And how serious are those events?\" he said, adding that his team can then aim for a lower incident rate.\n\nThirumalai and even Waymo's top brass aren't selling perfection. A human fatality caused by a robotaxi isn't a matter of if but when, Waymo co-CEO Tekedra Mawakana has said.\n\nReports and videos shared across social media have shown that AVs can make mistakes, whether in school zones, emergency response scenes, bad weather, or even seemingly ordinary driving scenarios.\n\n\"People might say, 'Hey, look, this is AI. We never want it to make a mistake.' That is an unachievable bar,\" Thirumalai said.",

    "description": "Two AI researchers said the 996 work culture, which is gaining traction in Silicon Valley, can lead to burnout for tech workers.",
    "fullText": "The AI wars are driving a more demanding work culture in Silicon Valley that some insiders worry is burning workers out.\n\nA \"996\" work schedule, in which employees work six days a week from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., has been well established in China and is taking hold in the San Francisco tech scene. While Silicon Valley has long been known for an intense work culture, some companies have recently adopted the more rigid 996 work schedule.\n\nNathan Lambert, a senior research scientist at the Allen Institute for AI, and Sebastian Raschka, an AI research lab founder, joined podcaster Lex Fridman in a recent episode about artificial intelligence. When asked about 996 culture in Silicon Valley, Raschka said what he's seen is not exactly the same as in China, but it's trending that way.\n\nThe current landscape of the tech industry consists of AI models leapfrogging each other to try to stay ahead of their competitors. For startups, the pressure to make it big can lead to grueling work schedules for employees.\n\n\"It's really hard because you have to deliver constantly,\" Raschka said.\n\nRaschka said both passion and competition are driving the grind mindset in Silicon Valley. He got a taste of this work culture while working as an academic in AI. He said he wasn't forced to overwork; he chose to.\n\nLambert said this mindset is showing up in some of the most recognizable companies in San Francisco and the AI industry.\n\n\"That's what OpenAI and Anthropic are like,\" he said, saying that employees commit to the high-pressure culture because they want to do the work, particularly the programmers.\n\nOpenAI and Anthropic did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nStill, Lambert said that the environment can come at a \"human expense,\" including lost time with family, closed-mindedness toward the rest of the world, and, sometimes, health issues.\n\n\"You can only do this for so long, and people are definitely burning out,\" he said.\n\nFor Raschka, the toll was back and neck pain from skipping breaks that he said he should've taken.\n\nIt's an environment that young programmers may have to brave if they want to make their mark in AI.\n\n\"If you're really passionate about wanting to have an impact in AI, being physically in SF is the most likely place where you're going to do this,\" Lambert said. \"But it has trade-offs.\"",

But after the recent round of cuts and product pullback, Meta's CTO acknowledge that the industry was growing \"more slowly than we had hoped.\"\n\nAndrew \"Boz\" Bosworth did a Q&A on his Instagram story on Monday. One of the questions Meta's chief technology officer received: \"There is a lot of doom and gloom about the future of Quest and gaming. What is the truth?\"\n\nBosworth said that the doom and gloom was mostly \"overwrought.\"\n\n\"There is a real cause for sadness here,\" Bosworth said, referencing Meta's recent cuts to its Reality Labs division, which houses Meta's metaverse and VR bets. \"You have people doing work that we were excited about, that we wanted to have in the system.\"\n\nMeta realized that its vision for Horizon and VR was \"too much,\" he said. Reality Labs has racked up more than $70 billion in losses since 2020.\n\n\"The investment that we put in is bigger than the growth that this ecosystem will allow,\" he said. \"That's a real loss. We are allowed to feel sad about those things.\"\n\nMeta has cut several of its VR products, including its virtual workplace and fitness apps.\n\nStill, Bosworth maintained that Meta was \"extremely bullish on VR,\" and that the company was investing \n\n\"Yes, we've receded from the high watermark, but we are still very much a net positive investor in the ecosystem,\" he said.\n\nReality Labs also houses Meta's AI glasses bet, which it has expanded rapidly. As Meta has bet big on wearables, some onlookers wondered whether that would require a pullback on VR.\n\nIn December, Bosworth said that the two products were separate and that Meta can pursue both. In the February update, he said that was still true.\n\n\"If VR were growing at the rate we all wish it were, we probably wouldn't have made these changes, and wearables would still be growing a ton,\" he said. \"It is wrong to think of those things as zero-sum.\"\n\nA year ago, Bosworth prophesied 2025 would be make-or-break for the metaverse. \"This year likely determines whether this entire effort will go down as the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure,\" he wrote in a memo obtained by Business Insider.\n\nWhich was it: the work of visionaries or a legendary misadventure? It's still unclear — though Bosworth doesn't sound so optimistic.\n\n\"It doesn't mean we're going to invest infinitely, forever,\" he said. \"We do need to have our investment match the size of growth.\"",

And if they wouldn't, you're probably not quite where you ought to be.\"\n\nWhen it comes to those gunning for the C-Suite, or maybe even his job, Robbins said you \"can't underestimate\" the value of EQ.\n\n\"The people who are wildly successful have this really incredible combination — in our industry — understand the technology, have high EQ, and really care about the mission of the team,\" he said.\n\nAs for himself, Robbins said he's always had a way to compartmentalize things he can't control. It's why he said he's nothing that is keeping him awake at night.\n\n\"Look, I've gone home where I've had a really bad day, and I look at my wife, and say, 'You want to hear the good news? I wasn't diagnosed with cancer today,'\" he said. \"And somebody was, and I wasn't.

    "description": "A Michigan mom lives with her husband, baby, parents, and grandparents. Multigenerational living is a growing trend amid the rising cost of living.",
    "fullText": "When Lily Telloyan was in middle school, her household grew from two generations to four. Her grandparents and great-grandmother were getting older, so her parents moved the whole family under one roof in Lansing, Michigan.\n\nNearly 20 years later, four generations of the family are living together again.\n\nAfter spending her college years in Indiana and then moving in with her husband, Alex, in Lansing, Lily started thinking about multigenerational living again. She hoped she could one day raise her own kids the way she'd been brought up.\n\n\"Even when I was dating my husband, I told him, this is my crazy dream,\" the 29-year-old said. \"If he'd said that wasn't what he was into, I think I would have questioned the longevity of our relationship.\"\n\nThat dream became a reality when Lily, who's a remote special education teacher, got pregnant, and the couple faced the soaring costs of childcare and Lily's grandparents' growing needs. In November 2024, Lily and Alex moved in with Lily's parents, Naomi and Tim Van Loh, and her grandparents, Sam and Eva Telloyan. (Lily and Alex took Eva and Sam's last name when they married). Lily and Alex's son, Xander, was born in April 2025.\n\nThey're just one of a growing share of American families moving back in together — or never separating in the first place. The number of people in the US living in multigenerational households — or those with two or more adult generations — quadrupled between 1971 and 2021, according to Pew Research. Cost savings are driving the trend. Families can split rent and mortgage payments, and save on childcare costs and long-term care costs for older relatives.\n\n\"When I considered how much I enjoyed my work and teaching and the level of care my grandparents were needing, and seeing the impacts of that on my mom as their primary caregiver, I became more and more convinced that the intergenerational model would be most beneficial for everybody in the family,\" Lily said.\n\nMornings in the Telloyan-Van Loh house start around 6:30 am, when Xander wakes up. Lily gets him dressed before her dad, a pastor at a local church, supervises morning playtime. Alex walks the family dog, Snoopy, while Naomi helps her parents get up and ready for the day. Lily and Naomi make breakfast as Alex, who works in cybersecurity, leaves for the office. Lily hands the baby to her mom when she starts her workday. All of that happens before 9:30 am.\n\nNaomi, who also works part-time as a remote educator, takes care of her grandson and her parents while the other adults are working. The childcare arrangement has allowed Lily to keep her job, which she loves. \"Running the numbers, it seems like a wash, honestly, to pay for childcare on a teacher's salary,\" she said.\n\nEva, who's 87, has dementia and needs constant attention. Professional long-term care, like assisted living, would strain the family's finances and wouldn't give Naomi the peace of mind she has with her parents under her roof, she said. She takes classes on caregiving at the local library.\n\n\"I don't know how we would do it the other way,\" said Naomi, 58, said of Eva's care. \"And, for me, knowing that she's safe, knowing that she's comfortable, knowing that she's happy, and I can see her and hear her, and I take care of everything she needs — to me that's worth more than money in the bank.\"\n\nAll six adult members of the family contribute financially to the household. They split living expenses, including utilities, property taxes, and groceries, evenly, though Naomi and Tim bought the house for $420,000 in 2021 and have since paid off the mortgage. Between the four working adults and Eva and Sam's Social Security benefits, their household income is around $230,000.\n\nThey've divided up the house so each couple has their own space. Naomi and Tim have the primary bedroom, Lily and Alex have two bedrooms and small offices downstairs, and Sam and Eva have their own bedroom and sitting room. Alex renovated the downstairs\n\nCaregiving responsibilities are harder to divide equally. \"I had to learn really early on — and I'm still not great at that — that we shouldn't really keep a running record, or try to keep things even when it comes to workload, we just all chip in and do our best as we are able,\" Lily said.\n\nSam often tells Naomi he worries that he and Eva are a burden on her and the family. But Naomi insists that she wouldn't have it any other way. She says she enjoys taking care of her parents, despite the challenges.\n\n\"We have this kind of ongoing conversation, too, about the balance between duty and desire for motivation,\" Naomi said. \"Some people think it's your duty, you have to do this.\"\n\nLily chimed in, \"The best case scenario is when you desire to do your duty.\"\n\nThere are also more mundane challenges. Logistics get a bit complicated when it comes to entertaining friends. The family has a shared calendar they use to plan their social engagements and travel six months in advance. Small things like a messy closet can create tension, so they're quick to address even minor infractions.\n\n\"When I'm irritated, I think to myself, 'This is what I signed up for because I like all the benefits,\" Naomi said. \"I mean, every life has irritation, right? Even if you live alone, you might irritate yourself.\"\n\nWhile multigenerational living is increasingly common, four generations in one home is still unusual. Lily and Naomi said they sometimes feel misunderstood by friends.\n\n\"When my friends hear about our lifestyle, we get a lot of negative comments, like, 'Oh, you need to be more independent.' Or like, 'Oh, are you doing this for financial reasons? Or are you saving up for a house?'\" Lily said. \"It takes people a little bit of time to realize this was plan A.\"\n\nFor now, they're sticking with plan A.\n\n\"I said to everybody, this is the last move of my entire life,\" Lily said. \"I think now we're in a pretty stable place.\"",

    "description": "Threats to executives are pushing companies like Starbucks and Disney to boost CEO security and mandate the use of corporate jets for personal travel.",
    "fullText": "For decades, executive security followed a familiar playbook: Most CEOs traveled freely at home, accepted protection only in high-risk foreign countries, and treated personal safety as a private concern rather than a boardroom imperative.\n\nMentions of exec security protocols are popping up in more proxy filings, and companies like Starbucks are changing corporate jet policies due to what it calls \"significant heightened security concerns.\"\n\nThese moves follow the December 2024 killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in New York City and a shooting at a Park Avenue office building about eight months later.\n\nBoth instances shattered long-held assumptions that corporate leaders were at least somewhat insulated from the types of violence more often associated with politicians or celebrities, several security executives told Business Insider.\n\nThere isn't a distinction between low-, medium-, or high-risk anymore, said Dale Buckner, head of the security firm Global Guardian, which works with Fortune 1000 companies.\n\n\"The risk is everywhere,\" he said.\n\nThe news of the disappearance of \"Today\" co-host Savannah Guthrie's mother, Nancy, has only added to a sense of unease for high-profile leaders, several of these execs said.\n\nBuckner, a retired US Army colonel who served for more than two decades, said his firm has briefed more boards in the past 11 months than in the previous 14 years combined. Increasingly, Buckner said, boards view CEOs and other C-suite members as assets that must be protected, even if some leaders are leery of perceived constraints on their freedom.\n\n\"The board is overruling the CEO who is going, 'I don't need this,'\" he said.\n\nIn regulatory filings, companies have begun to spell out their decisions. Starbucks said last month that, following a security review, it recommended that CEO Brian Niccol use company aircraft for both personal and work travel. While it's made that recommendation before, the company lifted a spending cap it had in place for personal travel and will instead review those costs each quarter.\n\nUnlike in its previous proxy a year earlier, Starbucks also cited \"the existence of credible threat actors.\"\n\nThose concerns extend beyond the coffee chain.\n\nDisney requires Bob Iger, who is set to step down as CEO next month, to use company aircraft for both business and personal travel. A security consultant identified \"bona-fide, business-related security concerns\" for Iger, Disney said in a January filing. That language didn't appear in the company's prior filing.\n\nMeatpacking giant Tyson Foods said it hired a consultant during its fiscal year that ended in September to review risks associated with its senior management team \"based on the evolving security environment for corporate executives.\" One resulting change: requiring certain execs to use company aircraft for both business and personal travel.\n\nProxy filings by large US public companies that mention \"executive security\" or \"corporate security\" rose from 69 in 2023 to 87 in 2025, according to an AlphaSense analysis.\n\nRepresentatives from Starbucks, Disney, and Tyson Foods didn't respond to Business Insider's requests for comment on the nature of the threats executives face.\n\nWhile high-profile CEOs have long had protection in high-risk zones, Buckner said what's grown more common is keeping executives under a 24/7 safety umbrella.\n\nBuckner said that the protocol for one of his protectees, a Fortune 500 CEO, includes 18 armed agents, camera surveillance of the executive's home, and monitoring of its WiFi network. A former garage on the property now serves as an \"op center,\" he said.\n\n\"I have two to four roving armed agents around their home, 24 hours a day,\" Buckner said.\n\nIt can be a challenge to determine whether something that starts as disapproval over a company or leader could morph into something more nefarious, security veterans said.\n\nA threat might start out as a joke in poor taste, and a group targeting a company might pick it up. Then, all of a sudden, it becomes a real risk, said Lisa Kaplan, founder and CEO of the risk-intelligence firm Alethea.\n\nCaleb Gilbert, founder of White Glove Protection Group, a security firm serving large companies and family offices, said the range of people who feel threatened has widened over the past six months.\n\n\"The reality of risk is resonating with more people. And that's different than I've seen in the last 30 years,\" he said.\n\nOne reason is that the cadence of high-profile incidents — from the attempted assassination of President Donald Trump in 2024 to the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk in September — hasn't seemed to slow, Gilbert said. While attacks on business leaders remain rare, many nonetheless feel rattled, he said.\n\n\"It used to be where something bad would happen, there'd be time in between, and the executives would forget about it,\" Gilbert said. Now, \"with the security-minded glasses that they put on, it's brought everything into focus.\"\n\nThe cost of protection is part of that view. A small protective detail can cost about $1 million a year, while a full-scale operation can reach $30 million, he said.\n\nIn some cases, Gilbert said, even without a board's prodding, executives are \"willing to give up personal liberties that they cherished before for the sake of feeling safe.\"\n\nThe apparent kidnapping of Nancy Guthrie could lead to demand from executives to detect threats against parents, Kaplan said. Typically, she receives requests from executives to monitor risks to their children.\n\nBuckner said he recently spoke to a group of CEOs in Washington, DC, on security threats. Many reported feeling unnerved, he said.\n\n\"It's palatable,\" he said. \"They're scared that they're in a new world order. They're not quite sure how to navigate it.\"",

    "description": "The US Army wants AI to help streamline some of its most tedious tasks for recruiters and logisticians.",
    "fullText": "The US Army's biggest AI gamble may not be on autonomous weapons, but instead whether Silicon Valley software can tackle the service's most tedious and, more often than not, grueling administrative jobs.\n\nThink less uncrewed aircraft and more behind-the-scenes tasks like recruiting, equipment maintenance, and endless gear inventories. Through a mix of new tools, redesigned workflows, and data integration, logisticians and data specialists are experimenting in hopes of modernizing how the largest military branch functions, a herculean effort leaders believe can cut the manual processes that have frustrated soldiers for decades.\n\n\"AI is kind of the tip of the iceberg, and you've got the rest of the thing underneath the waterline to make the Army go,\" David Markowitz, the Army's chief data officer and analytics officer, told Business Insider, speaking of the sprawling, multi-billion-dollar transformative effort.\n\nIt's not yet clear which experiments will ultimately succeed across the service. But improvements could be coming for some of the most hands-on, human endeavors. \"No one knows how to best change than the folks who deal with the work every day,\" Markowitz said.\n\nBusiness Insider visited the Arlington, Va., office where, every few months, dozens of soldiers meet with civilian engineers to test and refine a new customer relationship management system built on a Salesforce platform. If fielded, the system may dramatically simplify the burden for Army's recruiters — a job widely seen inside the Army as one of the most exhausting and burnout-prone assignments.\n\nToday, recruiters are bogged down by outdated processes.\n\nRecruiters are still expected to manually enter each potential recruit's information during every interaction, using a system that lacks the kind of easy interface that most Americans take for granted on their phones. The waivers many recruits need for fitness issues, test scores, or legal run-ins are another hassle that the Army believes AI could help simplify.\n\nA year ago, the service examined how much \"toil\" comes with enlisting a young person, said Alex Miller, who serves as the Army's chief technology officer.\n\n\"We found that there were thousands of individual pieces of information that they have to provide and most of them are repetitive,\" he said of the needed paperwork. Tasks as simple as copying down names and addresses by hand cumulatively suck up hours of precious time.\n\nA small group of recruiters in the Midwest are testing early versions of the software, sending feedback to developers in near real time.\n\nThe test unit has slashed administrative forms from several hundred forms to less than ten, Miller said.\n\nChange could be coming sooner for the troops who keep the Army's equipment running.\n\nThe service is \"on the cusp\" of allowing soldiers to query maintenance and readiness data across the force using simple prompts, said Richard Martin, the director of supply chain logistics at Army Materiel Command.\n\nThat could dramatically reduce the time it takes to answer some of the most consequential questions that Army leaders face.\n\n\"How many of this fleet should I overhaul in the next three years to improve material readiness by 15%?\" Martin posed, explaining that in a few months, leaders will be able to enter that prompt and receive data-driven recommendations that feed directly into planning, budgeting, and overhaul decisions, offering greater predictability for logisticians.\n\nTake some of the Army's biggest — and most expensive — gear, like the M2 Bradley infantry fighting vehicles, he said. \"Imagine if I could look across the fleet and type in a prompt that says, 'What brigade would benefit the most from 30 overhauled Bradleys?'\"\n\nRight now, it's nearly impossible to narrow down information to what's actually useful, similar to not being able to narrow an overflowing inbox to a single email, Miller, the chief technology officer, explained, or being given too many GPS routes when you just need a single good one. Most logistics data is managed on spreadsheets alone, siloed within units.\n\nThe system could also flag the Army's most problem-prone individual gear, such as some tanks that suck up millions in repair costs.\n\n\"This is the power of what we are building,\" Martin said. \"We're not there yet,\" he acknowledged. \"We're now in the position where we have the capability to ask those questions.\"\n\nThe Army and Marine Corps have struggled in recent years to maintain armored vehicle fleets amid shortages of spare parts and skilled maintainers. Officials say clearer, faster data could reduce the readiness quandaries that consume chains of command.\n\n\"It lets us start thinking very, very differently about how we're managing our fleets,\" Martin said.\n\nAt the lowest levels of logistics, AI might save soldiers hours of the most tedious work they do: Inventorying equipment by visually verifying serial numbers on everything from rifles and radios to generators and trucks.\n\nWhile private industry embraced electronic inventories years ago, most of the military still does it the old-fashioned way — on paper. It's a process that demands days of inspecting hard-to-reach serial numbers during monthly or quarterly checks.\n\nThese inspections carry real stakes for the lower-level troops handling inventory. Even simple mistakes, such as misplaced paperwork for an item shipped to a maintenance depot, can threaten careers.\n\n\"Imagine not having to legitimately look at every serial number on every rifle — but to open up a door, take an RFID scan, and know every single rifle is in its right place,\" Martin said of the reform effort.\n\nArmy officials acknowledged that none of these efforts is guaranteed to succeed across the force. Some equipment items are so small that keeping a barcode could be tricky.\n\nElsewhere, data quality remains uneven, adoption can be slow, and too many new tools can overwhelm users rather than help them. And some systems are so antiquated and essential, like the Army's pay and contracting systems, that they can't be easily updated.\n\nThe service is \"always in kind of a balancing act of what's the right mix and getting feedback,\" Markowitz said of the iterative efforts to field new technologies for troops to make jobs less punishing.\n\n\"We're in that kind of evolution stage.\"",

    "title": "A physician who racked up 7-figures of student debt explains how she started buying investment properties with her 401(k) funds",
    "description": "When Dr. Jill Green decided she wanted to invest in property, she was saddled with student loan debt and didn't have liquid savings. She did have money in a 401(k), but figured those funds were off limits.",
    "fullText": "\"My net worth was negative $1 million,\" the family practice and emergency medicine doctor told Business Insider. \"Our primary home was our only asset.\"\n\nGreen, who began her career in investment banking before pivoting to medicine, began entertaining the idea of property investing after hearing a physician couple speak at a virtual entrepreneur event for doctors. The couple, Kenji and Leti Asakura, used real estate investing to create an additional revenue stream, allowing them to scale back at work and spend half the year traveling.\n\nShe decided to enroll in their course, designed to help physicians build rental portfolios and reduce taxes.\n\nIt was a decent chunk of upfront money, about $2,500, for someone with a negative net worth, but Green viewed it as a smart investment for her and her husband.\n\n\"I was like, if we even get $10,000 back in our taxes next year, the course will have paid for itself four times. It seemed like a no-brainer, and he agreed,\" she said. \"So, I took the course, and our tax return that next year, after implementing what they taught, was $40,000. I was able to take that money and use it to buy another investment.\"\n\nWhen Green decided she wanted to invest in property, the main barrier was coming up with funds for the down payment: \"We didn't have $200,000 sitting in a savings account.\"\n\nShe and her husband did have some money in their 401(k) accounts, but they figured it was off-limits.\n\n\"I had heard of people taking money out of their 401(k) as loans before, and my thought was, 'Those people are irresponsible. You don't touch your retirement account,'\" said Green.\n\nIndeed, retirement-specific accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs come with early withdrawal penalties, intended to discourage investors from dipping into their retirement funds. However, as she learned in the real estate course, she could borrow (not withdraw) from her account.\n\n\"It's essentially taking a loan from yourself, and you're paying the interest back to yourself,\" Green explained. \"Your retirement account doesn't get touched, and there are no tax implications.\"\n\nShe and her husband ended up taking a loan from their 401(k) to help fund the purchase of their first investment property, a medical office building.\n\nUsing an SBA loan and buying in a low-interest rate environment helped keep their costs low, she added: \"The down payment requirement was quite small, and the interest rate was incredible.\" She said they locked in a 4% rate.\n\nBorrowing from her 401(k) posed a greater mental barrier. She had to convince herself that \"I'm not a reckless idiot. This is going to be OK to try something that I considered audacious like that,\" she said, adding that people still question her when they find out she used retirement money to fund real estate purchases. \"I've used that strategy more than once, and I've now become quite comfortable with it, but when I talked to other physicians about it, they're like, 'Do I need to write you a check for something? Are you doing OK?'\"\n\nAs for the actual process, she said it was simple and kick-started their rental portfolio, which they've gradually scaled, adding one rental property per year.\n\nThey selected a five-year repayment plan, which translated to about $200 per paycheck.\n\n\"It wasn't anything that we felt as a family,\" said Green. \"They just take it out of your paycheck. You're essentially paying yourself back every month. It was very easy.\"\n\nGreen said she doesn't believe real estate is as out of reach as many people think it is, particularly professionals with access to retirement accounts: \"Most people have a 401(k) because we've all been told to save for that, so most people have access to some capital that they can borrow from.\"\n\nAnd, it can be a potentially life-changing investment.\n\nShe said she's now debt-free, and her net worth has swung by about $4 million since 2019: \"I've been able to go to $3 million positive net worth. I don't think that there's a way to have that kind of power to amplify and literally change the position that you're in, from financial insecurity to financial security.\"\n\nThe most difficult part is taking the first step, especially if you're starting from a scarcity mindset like Green was. Her advice is to start small: Watch YouTube videos or listen to podcasts about real estate, \n\n\"Just start somewhere,\" she said. \"The difference between 0 and 1 is infinite — they call that the infinite 1%, to go from 0% to 1% of doing something. So, if you can just start somewhere, it literally doesn't even matter where, then you're already infinitely farther ahead than someone who never starts at all.\"",

    "description": "Recent volatility in the precious metals market is causing headaches for businesses that play an essential role in the circulation of gold and silver.",
    "fullText": "If January was a party in the precious metals market, February is the hangover.\n\nThe per-ounce price of gold topped $5,300 and silver reached nearly $120 at the end of January before tumbling sharply. The stretch of record gains and losses has since stabilized in the early days of February.\n\n\"These price moves have done a lot of damage all across the line,\" HSBC precious metals analyst James Steel told Business Insider.\n\nOne type of business bearing the brunt of volatility is local coin shops, where people often trade in gold and silver. High prices have led to a huge influx of people selling, but some shops tell Business Insider they're running out of their usual places to offload excess metals.\n\nAs the market was in its tailspin, Tim Heuer said his shop, University Coin & Jewelry in Madison, Wisconsin, was still doing deals.\n\nHeuer said a customer came in to sell some silver when the spot price was $98 an ounce and falling: \"By the time I wrote his check, silver was already down $3.50 from the time he walked in the door.\"\n\nThe recent volatility is putting those businesses in an uncomfortable position, beyond quickly changing spot prices that erode profit margins.\n\nLocal coin shops play an essential role in the circulation of physical gold and silver by providing a reliable way for individuals to sell their bars, coins, or scrap metal.\n\nIf someone bought a gold bar last year from Costco and wants to turn it back into cash, a local coin shop is one of the first places they might go.\n\nAnd while these shops do turn around and sell some of what they buy, most of the metal is sold to refineries to be melted and minted into new bars or coins.\n\nThat flow has been interrupted in recent months as the run in gold and silver prices has encouraged more people to trade in their metals, leading to a backlog of raw materials at refineries.\n\nJarret Niesse, president of Precious Metal Refining Services in Chicago, said his company stopped buying scrap silver back in October, when the price crossed $50 per ounce, sparking a frenzy of people trading in old silverware, platters, and other tchotchkes that had been gathering dust.\n\nAnd the market has only gotten wilder since then.\n\n\"This entire crazy silver move that has happened, we have been sitting on the sidelines,\" he said.\n\nRefineries like Niesse's are one step in the process. Much of the product they melt down gets further refined by other mints and exported to Asian markets, where demand for bars and coins is higher. With so much gold and silver to process, those refineries have also stopped buying, thereby cutting into the cash flow of local coin shops.\n\n\"When the guys at the top say they're going to open the doors and start accepting more material, the guys in the middle, like me and my competitors, will send in,\" Neisse said.\n\nDue to their role in their local markets, reputable coin shops can't simply stop buying altogether. They're finding ways to adjust, but it's a tricky balance.\n\n\"If you do this wrong, you run out of capital really fast,\" Spoerl said.\n\nIt's not the kind of business where tapping debt or credit from a bank makes real sense, either.\n\n\"You don't want to hold metal and finance it for any length of time,\" HSBC's Steel said.\n\nBoth Spoerl and Heuer's shops have recently started instituting limits on how much they'll buy from a single person in a day, a move that they say allows them to serve more customers and get people the cash they might need for expenses like annual tax payments or medical bills.\n\nIt's anyone's guess what prices will do in the coming days and weeks, but Spoerl and Heuer said they'll keep trying to thread the needle between serving customers and not overstretching their balance sheets.\n\n\"For us to stop buying now would be a little odd,\" Spoerl said. \"This is something that we haven't seen before, so it's just kind of going with the flow and figuring out what to do in the moment.\"\n\nHeuer, meanwhile, is thinking long-term: Gold is still up 76% and silver is up 147% from a year ago.\n\n\"If you look at a one-year, short-term investment, you still almost tripled your money,\" he said of silver. \" The cost average ratio is still splendid.\"",

    "description": "Steven Wang, David Kobrosky, and Eric Chen all dropped out of college to launch their ideas at the perfect time.",
    "fullText": "Steven Wang planned to start a business after graduating from Harvard.\n\nBut eight months into college life, in June 2021, he dropped out to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions, inspired by the boom in meme stocks and crypto.\n\nInvesting was one of his long-term interests, and Wang wanted to take advantage of that year's retail investor craze, and his company, Dub, was born.\n\nThe platform allows retail investors to automatically copy the trades of more experienced investors. In an interview published in February 2025, Wang told Business Insider that Dub had a team of around 25 people and had raised $17 million, including from Uber's CEO and Robinhood's founding chief operating officer.\n\nThe journey has come with trade-offs, he told Business Insider. Wang has sometimes felt jealous of friends who've been able to ride out the college experience, and he has fantasized about returning to study philosophy.\n\nIf the investor craze never happened, Wang said he would have probably finished his degree, but when he saw the opportunity presented by the growing investor movement, he couldn't let it go, he said. As someone with a deep love for building products, he believes he made the right choice.\n\nDavid Kobrosky dropped out of college twice. Once to work for the businessman and social media personality Gary Vaynerchuk, and once to build his own company.\n\nIn late 2020, at age 21, he left college to take advantage of an emerging market in digital connection prompted by the COVID-19 pandemic, creating Intros AI, which uses artificial intelligence to help people connect and network.\n\nAfter eight months of bootstrapping, he raised funds from investors, including the White House AI advisor Siriam Krishnan. In July 2025, Kobrosky's business was acquired by a software company called Bevy.\n\nWith success came sacrifice. Kobrosky told Business Insider he used to work seven days a week and missed out on time with friends. Even after he was diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma, a type of blood cancer, in early 2024, he worked 60 to 80 hours a week on the business while undergoing chemotherapy. He was told he was in remission in November 2024.\n\nLooking back, Kobrosky said he doesn't regret abandoning the traditional college route. He thinks starting and selling a business at his age set him up well for the future.\n\nWhen Eric Chen went to NYU in 2016, he pictured going into finance or tech after graduating. Then he found he could spend hours learning about blockchain technology without getting bored, and decided to immerse himself in that space rather than stay in college.\n\nIn the fall of 2018, Chen took a leave of absence from NYU and started Injective, a decentralized crypto exchange platform. Chen saw the moment as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for a young person like him to contribute to a nascent space without much prior experience.\n\nChen faced challenges like investors not buying into decentralized exchanges, and he said not having a degree probably didn't help his case. However, when the industry blew up in 2020, the company was able to raise a seed round, and Chen decided not to go back to NYU.\n\nIn an interview published in September 2025, Chen told Business Insider the company had raised $50 million and secured investment from Mark Cuban.\n\nChen concluded that the industry would have changed drastically if he'd waited a few more years to start Injective, and said those passionate about an opportunity they spot should take it.\n\nDo you have a story about dropping out of college to start a business?

For Maduro and Rodríguez, that blend includes the teachings of Sathya Sai Baba, who has had a strong global following for over 50 years for his message of unity, love and spiritual oneness that transcends religious, social and cultural barriers.\n\nMaduro frequently invoked Christ, the Holy Spirit and God in his speeches as president, framing his government’s struggles as a spiritual battle for Venezuela’s soul and sovereignty. Just weeks before his Jan. 3 capture by U.S. forces, he celebrated the centenary of Sai Baba in a social media post, expressing his hope that “the wisdom of this great teacher will continue to illuminate us in the mission of building a homeland of love, peace and high spirituality.”\n\nRodríguez visited Sai Baba’s ashram in southern India as recently as 2024. She said during her first presidential media briefing last month that the Venezuelan people faced “a new moment where coexistence, mutual respect, and recognition of others allow for the construction and building of a new spirituality.”\n\nRodríguez also said in an interview with the organization's official channel during a 2023 visit that she still feels the guru's presence in trying times.\n\n“Many times, when I was in danger, I felt Baba with me, my family and also with my country,” she said. “He is always with us, teaching us … and showing a path for peace and love.”\n\nTop leaders' fondness for Sathya Sai Baba\n\nThe U.S. military seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from their Caracas home Jan. 3 in a stunning operation that landed them in New York to face federal drug trafficking charges. Maduro called himself “a man of God” while pleading not guilty.\n\nAfter Maduro’s capture, several news outlets in India published a 2005 photo that shows him and his wife seated at the feet of the Sai Baba, who had distinctive black, curly locks and wore a long saffron robe. It has been widely reported that Maduro displayed a large, framed photograph of Sai Baba in his office at Miraflores Palace in Caracas, alongside portraits of Latin America's liberator Simón Bolívar and former Venezuelan leader Hugo Chávez.\n\nMaduro, who declared a national day of mourning upon Sai Baba’s death in 2011, marked the 2025 centenary by hailing the spiritual leader as “a being of light” and a “beacon of unconditional love, selfless service and truth.”\n\nVideos posted by Sai Baba’s organization, which is still active and ubiquitous in India, have shown Rodríguez visiting its ashram and headquarters in Puttaparthi, a town in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. During visits in 2023 and 2024, she can be seen praying at the sanctum, the guru’s final resting place, which devotees believe radiates spiritual energy. She can also be seen interacting with R.J. Rathnakar, Sai Baba's nephew who currently heads the organization.\n\nThe Associated Press’ efforts to reach the Sai Baba organization in India and Venezuela for comment went unanswered.\n\nThe Sai Baba’s organization’s presence in Venezuela\n\nSai Baba’s organization came to Venezuela long before Maduro and other politicians sought out the guru. The organization opened its first center in Caracas on Aug. 22, 1974, started by Arlette Meyer, a devotee who wrote books in Spanish about the guru. In her apartment, she and a few other members sang devotional hymns and studied Sai Baba’s teachings — the organization’s first such center in Latin America.\n\nThe organization in Venezuela now appears to be centered in Abejales, a town in the state of Táchira, about 465 miles (750 kilometers) west of Caracas, where it runs a “Human Values School.” The town is the birthplace of former lawmaker Walter Márquez, who has maintained close ties with Sai Baba before and after serving as Venezuela’s ambassador to India. Márquez was honored by the Sai Baba organization in Venezuela late last year. Some estimates put the number of Sai Baba followers in Venezuela at about 200,000 and millions globally.\n\nThe role of religion in Venezuelan politics\n\nFaith in Venezuela is not monolithic, said Andrew Chesnut, professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond. He said while Catholicism is still dominant, it coexists comfortably with evangelical Protestantism, Afro-Indigenous traditions and transnational religious figures, without requiring formal conversion or exclusive allegiance.\n\n“This syncretic religious ecology helps explain how Nicolás Maduro can describe himself as a devotee of Sri Sathya Sai Baba while simultaneously cultivating close relationships with evangelical leaders who operate within a very different theological universe,” he said.\n\nReligion is invoked rhetorically by Venezuelan politicians, rather than to dictate policy or shape laws, Chesnut said. Encounters with figures like Sai Baba “carry symbolic and performative weight rather than serving as drivers of political ideology or decision-making,” he said.\n\nAn influential and controversial figure\n\nSathya Sai Baba, who was born Ratnakaram Sathyanarayana Raju, claimed to be the reincarnation of Shirdi Sai Baba, a guru revered by Hindus and Muslims, who died in 1918. Sathya Sai Baba became popular in India and worldwide in the 1970s and 1980s as word spread of his miraculous abilities to materialize objects such as rings, necklaces and sacred ash. He is believed to have performed spontaneous healings and resurrections.\n\nSai Baba encouraged his followers to practice their own religions, often saying that God is one and that all paths led to the same truth. He was known for sayings that reflected his message of unity and service: “Love All, Serve All” and “Help Ever, Hurt Never.”\n\nThe guru was known for interacting with devotees, meeting them individually or in groups. Though he traveled just once outside India — in the 1960s to East Africa — the movement became global, establishing nearly 2,000 nondenominational centers in 120 countries, including 200 in the U.S, according to the organization's website.\n\nAmong his followers are Bollywood actors, cricketers, prominent business leaders and millions of average Indians who flock to Sai Baba centers for worship, prayer and singing bhajans or devotional songs, many in praise of the guru.\n\nSai Baba faced intense criticism from some corners, particularly rationalists and scientists, who accused him of faking his miraculous materializations. He also faced criminal allegations including accusations of fraud, sexual abuse and murder, but was never charged with any of those crimes. His followers dismissed those allegations as slander and propaganda.\n\nSai Baba still has ardent devotees like Dr. Samuel Sandweiss, a retired psychiatrist based in Southern California, who visited the guru nearly 80 times since 1972. He said he has seen the guru materialize everything from sacred ash called vibhuti to several golden rings.\n\nSandweiss is not surprised that Maduro and other Venezuelan leaders followed Sai Baba.\n\n“I’ve seen him with all kinds of people from all walks of life — from the lowest to the highest,” he said. “His main message was that love transcends all religion and unites us all.”",

    "description": "The daughter of NFL Hall of Famer Tom Mack reflects on growing up with a legendary player who balanced football, work, and family.",
    "fullText": "On the occasion of my father's 82nd birthday, I called him to wish him well. As we chatted, I told him about a social media post shared by his former team, the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nMy dad doesn't pay attention to social media, so he wouldn't know that the post had garnered hundreds of likes and comments. Many fans wished him a happy birthday, while others recalled his skill on the field and their favorite memories of watching him play.\n\n\"That's neat,\" my father said in his understated manner. I could hear the smile in his voice.\n\nMy father, Tom Mack, was an offensive lineman for the Los Angeles Rams from 1966 through 1978. He played in 184 consecutive games over 13 seasons, served as team captain, and was named to 11 Pro Bowls. He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999.\n\nBut to me, he's just my dad. He walks his dog, attends church, and shops at Walmart. People usually don't recognize him as one of the game's all-time greats.\n\nWhen I was growing up as the daughter of an NFL player in the 1970s, there were definitely some perks, like the trip our family took to Hawaii when my dad participated in a celebrity rodeo. After home games, my two sisters and I, along with my mom, would greet our dad outside his locker room at the Los Angeles Coliseum. My sisters and I would run around with our autograph books getting signatures from teammates, including Merlin Olsen and Jack Youngblood.\n\nI admit I'm a bit jealous of today's NFL kids, who seem to get on the field regularly. I only stepped on the field with my dad once, for the Pro Bowl in 1979, his final game.\n\nWhile going on the field was rare, seeing him on television was another perk of having an NFL dad, especially back when there were so few channels. He was interviewed on the news and appeared in local commercials. It was especially exciting when he guest-starred on the popular series \"Six Million Dollar Man,\" playing a bad guy in a slow-motion football match against Lee Majors as Steve Austin.\n\nIt wasn't all glamorous, though. Even though he played 13 seasons, his entire career occurred before the advent of cable TV and huge salaries.\n\nIn fact, my dad and his teammates worked other jobs during the offseason. Some of them sold cars or real estate, while my dad worked as a mechanical engineer for a global engineering and construction company.\n\nAs a kid, I didn't think of my dad as someone with two careers. I just knew he went to work. What mattered to me was that he ate dinner with us and came to my soccer games and ballet recitals.\n\nOther people, however, seemed far more interested in what he didn't have.\n\nMy sisters and I were athletic and enjoyed playing sports when women's sports were in their infancy. People asked us constantly if we had any brothers. Whenever I replied no, I was struck by how many strangers asked, \"Didn't your dad want sons?\"\n\nMy dad never made me feel like he wanted sons, and my mom echoed that. He had grown up in the shadow of his own father, who played Major League Baseball, and knew the weight that came with that legacy. He always told me he was happy to raise girls without the pressure to follow in his footsteps.\n\nWhen he retired at the end of the 1978 NFL season, he went to work full-time as an engineer, and my family left the football world behind. Surprisingly, we moved across the country more for his engineering career than for football.\n\nWhen he was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1999, it was fun to revisit his career. Each summer, he returns to Canton, Ohio, for enshrinement weekend, reconnecting with teammates and other legends. The Rams organization treats him well, too, checking in and welcoming him back to games.\n\nI love it when fans recognize him. When it does, fans get stars in their eyes. From the time I was a little girl until now, I've witnessed my dad remain humble and gracious with every fan he meets.\n\nI think of him not as one of the NFL's greatest players, but simply as my dad. He modeled hard work and humility with a dash of humor, remaining competitive even off the field — he never lost a board game to my sisters or me until we could beat him on our own merit. He took me fishing and camping, taught me to drive a stick shift, and walked me down the aisle.\n\nHe may have been a legendary football player, but I'd argue he's an even greater dad.",

    "description": "A new Super Bowl ad from Hims & Hers telehealth touts a blood test for cancer. It's $700, but it's not a replacement for regular screening.",
    "fullText": "A Super Bowl ad airing this weekend by telehealth company Hims & Hers pokes fun at \"rich people\" and their obsession with living longer.\n\n\"All that money doesn't just buy more stuff, it buys more time,\" the ad voiceover says, a gentle nod toward rich and powerful longevity enthusiasts such as Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos, and Bryan Johnson.\n\nYet the commercial also argues our \"wealth gap is a health gap\" and that everyday people should have the same access to high-end biological testing that elite concierge medicine services offer the rich, such as regular blood draws, GLP-1 drugs, and yes, peptides. The latest addition to that mix: cancer screening through a simple blood test.\n\nThe new Hims & Hers test, Grail's Galleri, is part of a growing suite of blood tests and more \"proactive\" care the telehealth company is offering to mere normal folks.\n\nIt is not exactly cheap, though. It requires a $350 annual lab membership, which includes tests that measure cardiometabolic health, to assess risk for conditions like heart disease or high cholesterol, and hormone levels. On top of that, customers can pay for Grail's Galleri blood draw at a discounted rate of $700. That's $250 less than the retail price for Galleri, but still $1,050 all in for a test that, based on current data, has limited ability of telling you whether you have early-stage cancer.\n\nGrail's test uses two vials of blood to screen for over 50 types of cancer, including some tough-to-find types like pancreatic and ovarian cancer, for which routine screening doesn't exist.\n\nIn the US, more than 50% of cancer cases are caught at the later stages 3 and 4, after the disease has started spreading. The ultimate promise of new blood tests like Grail is that many cancers could be caught earlier by looking at a person's blood, instead of waiting for vague symptoms to surface that might initially be dismissed, further delaying diagnosis.\n\nGrail's test works by detecting cancerous DNA that is shed into a person's blood. So it makes sense that it would be better at finding late-stage cancer: If someone has cancer that has just started to grow, there might be no trace of its DNA — yet — from drawing a couple of vials of blood.\n\nWhat will be important for Grail to show, in the coming years and decades, is that it can definitively improve cancer outcomes and prevent more cancer deaths by finding more early-stage cancer before it's too late.\n\nAccording to an ongoing study of 35,000 people by the company, the Galleri test is over 99% specific, meaning that if it says you have cancer, there is a very good chance you do have cancer.\n\nHowever, it may not detect every case: interim results released in October 2025 suggest the diagnostic test detects about 40% of cancers overall. Which means if you do have cancer, there's a worse than 50-50 chance that a Galleri blood draw will find it.\n\nGrail points to the fact that in the same study, its cancer screening led to a \"more than seven-fold increase\" in the number of cases of breast, cervical, colorectal, and lung cancer found in a year, including some cancers that may not have been picked up through standard-of-care screenings like mammograms.\n\n\"How much more cancer is being detected in the population is what we need to measure to assess the public health impact,\" the company said in an email to Business Insider.\n\nA 2021 study of the test showed it picked up about 17% of early-phase stage 1 cancers, and more than 90% of stage 4 cancers, the kind that have metastasized and spread to other areas of the body. That uncertainty, especially in early stages, could lull some people into a false sense of security that they are cancer-free when they are not. \n\nHims & Hers Chief Medical Officer Patrick Carroll said Grail has been educating a few dozen doctors and nurse practitioners at the company on how to convey this to patients.\n\n\"They provide really robust information about how to message it, what the test means, what it doesn't mean,\" he said. \"It's a screening, not a diagnostic test.\"\n\nIf Grail ends up helping people find more early-stage cancers that have no other screening tools, like pancreatic cancer, maybe it will help improve death rates and outcomes. There just isn't enough data to suggest it does save lives, at least not yet.\n\nProfessor Anna Schuh, an expert in molecular diagnostics at the University of Oxford in the UK, said Galleri's \"low pick up rate\" for early cancer, and the cost, give her pause, at least for now.\n\n\"That in my view makes this approach currently unsuitable for population screening,\" she said when the latest Galleri trial results were released last October.\n\nGrail founder Jeff Huber, the company's former CEO, recently told Business Insider that he knows this isn't a one-and-done product. He couples his own annual Grail test with a full-body MRI scan, plus the normal age-appropriate cancer screening measures, like colonoscopies, to get a multimodal picture of what's going on in his body.\n\n\"It's a compliment\" to other cancer testing, he said. \"I do feel deeply offended by the current state of things, where Grail is a rich people product.\"\n\nCarroll, the CMO at Hims & Hers, said the company's patients have been asking for Grail by name for a while.\n\n\"Through a lot of internal research with our customers, they're very interested in Grail, and they're very interested in lab biomarker testing,\" he said.\n\nHims & Hers was part of a $325 million private placement investment into Grail last October. \"It's expensive, but we are also trying to make it more affordable,\" Carroll added.\n\nCompetitors are also starting to emerge. Last September, Exact Sciences, the makers of Cologuard, a noninvasive colon cancer screening test, unveiled Cancerguard, a blood test that also screens for more than 50 different cancers. It's $689.\n\nAs a former CMO at Walgreens, Carroll said he's seen many patients (and their employers) pivoting to \"high-deductible\" health plans where they may end up paying upward of $2,000 out of pocket for lab work.\n\n\"We feel if we can keep it below that $2,000 mark or even $1,500 mark, folks are going to make an informed decision about what I'm willing to pay out of pocket for this,\" he said. \"Because quite honestly, they're paying out of pocket for a lot of the healthcare today.\"\n\nHuber, the former Grail executive, hopes the Galleri test can eventually be available as a \"$100 test that's reimbursed\" and part of a regular annual checkup. What Hims & Hers is offering is different: a quick telehealth screening with a provider, and then a trip to Quest labs to draw blood, \"no connections required,\" as their 2026 Super Bowl ad says.",

    "description": "In this Sunday edition of Business Insider Today, we're talking about what AI means for the future of the software business.",
    "fullText": "Software stocks had a brutal week, aside from a Friday rally, extending what has been a rough year for the industry. I touched base with our tech columnist, Ali Barr, the best I know on AI business models. He also wrote this piece in the midst of the selloff.\n\nAli, you've been covering AI adoption and costs by big business since you started our Tech Memo newsletter. What's your gut on whether the recent selloff was overblown?\n\nSoftware business models have underpinned the tech industry for decades. Companies invest heavily upfront to build software, but each additional copy costs almost nothing to distribute. So revenue scales faster than costs, driving fat profit margins. That dynamic helps explain why Microsoft, the world's largest software company, is so valuable.\n\nAI challenges this model. If this new technology makes employees more productive, companies may need fewer software subscriptions. And as AI tools improve, businesses could replace existing software with AI-driven workflows or even build their own software using AI coding tools. Finally, if software companies embrace AI, that could make their services more expensive to run than traditional software. That would mean rising usage doesn't automatically translate into soaring profitability.\n\nIf software in the AI era becomes less profitable and grows more slowly, then it's logical that the stock prices of software companies might fall. A lot.\n\nBig Tech spending on AI data centers and other infrastructure is set to soar again this year. How will these companies generate a return on these huge investments?\n\nThe numbers are breathtaking. Just two companies, Google and Amazon, are planning capex of almost $400 billion in 2026. A couple more years of the same, and that's more than $1 trillion.\n\nTo get a return on this, they will have to come up with new revenue of well over $1 trillion in future years. AI is amazing and really useful, but it's hard for some investors to see how this happens. Even if new AI products are awesome, do consumers and companies have enough money to buy all this stuff? I don't know. One outcome could be that Big Tech giants make do with slimmer profit margins in an AI future. That's similar to the concerns that have hammered software stocks lately.\n\nWho are the most-interesting people to watch in the sector?\n\nI pay attention to Andrej Karpathy. He was director of AI at Tesla and a founding member of OpenAI. He's pretty independent nowadays, which means what he says about AI can be trusted more. Bonus: He coined the term \"vibe coding.\"\n\nAditya Agarwal was Facebook's first head of product engineering. He was also CTO and VP of engineering at Dropbox. He's a coding powerhouse. Recently, he used Claude to do some coding and was stunned by the power of this tool. \"I am filled with wonder and also a profound sadness,\" he wrote on X. \"We will never ever write code by hand again. It doesn't make any sense to do so. Something I was very good at is now free and abundant.\"\n\nI'm usually skeptical, but the start of 2026 feels like a moment of highly disruptive — and destructive — change.",

    "description": "Thomas Kaplan championed the lifelong benefits of being grateful, acting with conviction, and being willing to say \"I don't know.\"",
    "fullText": "Gratitude, humility, and conviction are key ingredients for a happy and successful life, Thomas Kaplan says.\n\nThe billionaire investor, who owns the world's largest private collection of artworks by Rembrandt van Rijn, spoke to Business Insider ahead of the auction of \"Young Lion Resting\" at Sotheby's New York on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rembrandt drawing, which Kaplan co-owned, sold for nearly $18 million — with the proceeds going to Panthera, the \"big cat\" conservation nonprofit he cofounded.\n\nKaplan said that protecting endangered felines has been his greatest passion since he was six years old. He dreamed of studying big cats as a felid zoologist, only to realize a few years later that he lacked the flair for science required.\n\n\"But I made a vow to myself — I think I was about 12 — if I ever make enough money, I'm going to come back to the subject, and I will support and enable all of those conservationists who had the aptitude that I didn't have,\" Kaplan said.\n\nHe went on to make a fortune in the energy and precious metal industries. True to his word, he cofounded Panthera in 2006 with leading cat conservationist the late Alan Rabinowitz, and the pair built the organization into a world leader in the field.\n\n\"I'm very mission-driven, and I will do anything to move the needle on those things that move me,\" Kaplan said.\n\nKaplan shared three pieces of life advice with Business Insider.\n\nAsked how he kept his three children grounded in an ultrawealthy household, he said they were simply \"not motivated by money.\"\n\n\"No bling, no social media, no cars or watches or any accoutrements of wealth. None,\" he added.\n\nKaplan said he drilled into them the importance of giving back and being thankful, as he believes the \"basis for all happiness is living a life of gratitude.\"\n\nHe's made sure they \"understand if you are an ungrateful person, you will be miserable and deserve to be.\"\n\nKaplan also underscored the need to recognize the limits of your knowledge and resist speculating beyond what you deeply understand. Warren Buffett would describe that as staying within one's \"circle of competence.\"\n\n\"Don't be afraid to say, 'I don't know,'\" Kaplan said. \"Credibility is hard won, easily lost.\"\n\nThe NovaGold Resources chairman said that people respect his expertise in certain subjects, and he never wants to \"debase that currency by being flippant.\"\n\n\"Be disciplined enough not to feel that because you're asked something, you have to answer it,\" he said.\n\nKaplan's final piece of advice was \n\n\"If you're going to go down, go down for something that wasn't flippant, but was thought through,\" he said.\n\n\"When you have a relative advantage, push the pedal to the metal,\" Kaplan added. \"If you don't have a relative advantage, don't play.\"",

    "fullText": "BANGKOK, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Voters in Thailand came out in numbers on Sunday for a general election defined by a three-way battle between conservative, progressive and populist camps, with no single party expected to secure a clear majority and prolonging the spectre of political instability.\n\nPrime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul ​set the stage for the snap election in mid-December, amid a raging border conflict between Thailand and Cambodia, in what analysts said was a move timed by the ‌conservative leader to cash in on surging nationalism.\n\nAt that point, he had been in power for less than 100 days, taking over after the ouster of premier Paetongtarn Shinawatra of the populist Pheu Thai party over the Cambodian crisis.\n\nPheu ‌Thai, backed by the billionaire former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who himself went to jail just days after his daughter's removal, is down but not out, according to surveys.\n\n\"We have done everything that we can,\" Anutin told reporters, after casting his vote in his Bhumjaithai Party's stronghold of Buriram city, northeast of Bangkok. \"We hope the people will have confidence in us.\"\n\nBut it is the progressive People's Party, with its message of structural change and reforms to Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, that led most opinion polls during the campaign season.\n\n\"This election is about whether Thailand will get out of its rut, whether Thailand ⁠will break out of its political instability and economic doldrums that ‌have persisted,\" said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University.\n\n\"My preliminary conclusion, I'm afraid to say, is that it will not break out.\"\n\nA steady stream of voters walked into polling stations across Bangkok in the hours after polls opened, among them Suwat Kiatsuwan, a 44-year-old company worker.\n\n\"I don't ‍want the same people anymore,\" he said, after casting his ballot. \"If we vote for the same as before, nothing will change. We were going nowhere.\"\n\nPolls closed at 5 p.m. local time (1000 GMT) and preliminary results were expected within a few hours.\n\nAlthough it has taken the fight to Anutin's Bhumjaithai Party and Pheu Thai, People's Party may not have enough support to win a parliamentary majority on its own - raising the risk ​of repeating its predecessor's fate.\n\nIn a survey conducted during the final week of the campaign that was released on Sunday, the National Institute for Development Administration projected Bhumjaithai would be ‌the winner with between 140 and 150 seats in the 500-member House of Representatives, ahead of 125-135 for the People's Party.\n\nMove Forward, the forerunner of the People's Party, won the last election in 2023 only to be blocked from forming a government by a military-appointed Senate and conservative lawmakers, opening the door for Pheu Thai to take over.\n\nThis long-standing tussle between the powerful royalist-conservative establishment and popular democratic movements has created prolonged periods of uncertainty, punctuated by street protests, bouts of violence and military coups.\n\nThai voters will also be asked during the vote to decide if a new constitution should replace a 2017 charter, a military-backed document that critics say concentrated power in undemocratic institutions, including a powerful senate that is chosen through an indirect selection process with limited ⁠public participation.\n\nThailand has had 20 constitutions since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, with most of the ​changes following military coups.\n\nIf voters back the drafting of a new national charter, the new government and lawmakers can ​start the amendment process in parliament with two more referendums required to adopt a new constitution.\n\n\"I believe that the party that wins in the next election will have an outsized influence on the direction of constitutional reform, whether we move away from the junta-drafted constitution or not,\" said Napon Jatusripitak of ‍the Bangkok-based Thailand Future think-tank.\n\nBhumjaithai's rise on surging ⁠nationalism unleashed by the Thai-Cambodia conflict - alongside the decline of Pheu Thai after its travails last year - has triggered a rash of defections and reshaped political battlegrounds, including vote-rich agrarian belts.\n\nSome political parties have responded by drawing into their camps well-known local figures, including those from rival groups, aiming to capture personal loyalty networks that are key to ⁠winning in the hinterland.\n\nThe reform-minded People's Party has also changed its playbook, diluting the progressive movement's anti-establishment stance and bringing in outside talent to convince voters that it has what it takes to run a government.\n\nFormer Prime Minister ‌Abhisit Vejjajiva has thrown himself into the mix, leveraging his personal appeal to revive his once moribund Democrat Party, which could emerge as a key force in ‌post-election coalition talks.\n\n(Additional reporting by Thomas Suen, Minh Nguyen and Napat Wesshasartar; Editing by Raju Gopalakrishnan)",

    "title": "Prediction: The Trump Bull Market Will Come to an Abrupt End From an Unlikely Source -- the Federal Reserve",
    "description": "Wall Street's foremost financial institutional has transformed from Wall Street's bedrock to a stock market liability.",
    "fullText": "From a purely statistical standpoint, Wall Street loves President Donald Trump. While getting from Point A to B was a roller-coaster ride, the widely followed Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI), broad-based S&P 500 (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), and growth stock-dependent Nasdaq Composite (NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) soared 57%, 70%, and 142%, respectively, during Trump's first, non-consecutive term in the Oval Office.\n\nSince his inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025, the Trump bull market has taken shape, yet again. The Dow, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite have climbed by 13%, 15%, and 18%, respectively, through the close of trading on Feb. 3, 2026.\n\nWill AI create the world's first trillionaire? Our team just released a report on the one little-known company, called an \"Indispensable Monopoly\" providing the critical technology Nvidia and Intel both need. Continue »\n\nWhile several catalysts are fueling this bull market rally, some of which can be directly attributed to Donald Trump's policies, there's also an unlikely headwind that threatens to completely halt this seemingly unwavering optimism in its tracks: the Federal Reserve.\n\nBefore diving into what's been working, some objectivity is needed. Based on data compiled by Carson Investment Research, 26 of the last 33 presidential terms, including the present term for Trump, have yielded a positive aggregate return for the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500. A president overseeing gains in the stock market is perfectly normal.\n\nOut of the 33 terms analyzed since March 1897, Carson Investment Group found Trump's first term yielded the eighth-best cumulative return. Spanning 129 years, Trump's initial foray in the Oval Office ranked in the top quartile among presidents.\n\nOne reason for this persistent optimism has been Trump's flagship tax and spending laws. In particular, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), signed into law in December 2017, permanently reduced the peak marginal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% (the lowest level since 1939).\n\nAlthough the purpose of lowering taxes for businesses is to encourage hiring, acquisitions, and innovation, perhaps the most visible effect of the TCJA has been a significant increase in share buybacks. Share repurchases for S&P 500 companies are estimated to have topped $1 trillion in 2025, representing an all-time high. For time-tested companies with steady or growing net income, buybacks can help boost earnings per share, making their stock more fundamentally attractive.",

    "fullText": "JERUSALEM (AP) — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet with U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday about American talks with Iran, his office said Saturday, while Iran's foreign minister threatened U.S. military bases in the region a day after the discussions.\n\n“The prime minister believes that all negotiations must include limiting the ballistic missiles, and ending support for the Iranian axis,” Netanyahu’s office said in a brief statement, referring to Tehran's support for militant groups, including Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in the Palestinian territories. Trump and Netanyahu last met in December.\n\nThere was no immediate White House comment.\n\nThe U.S. and the Islamic Republic of Iran held indirect talks on Friday in Oman that appeared to return to the starting point on how to approach discussions over Tehran’s nuclear program.\n\nTrump called the talks “very good” and said more were planned for early next week. Washington was represented by Middle East special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law.\n\nTrump has repeatedly threatened to use force to compel Iran to reach a deal on its nuclear program after sending the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln and other warships to the region amid Tehran’s crackdown on nationwide protests that killed thousands.\n\nGulf Arab nations fear an attack could spark a regional war, with memories fresh of the 12-day Israel-Iran war in June.\n\nFor the first time in negotiations with Iran, the U.S. on Friday brought its top military commander in the Middle East to the table. U.S. Navy Adm. Brad Cooper, head of the military’s Central Command, then visited the USS Abraham Lincoln on Saturday with Witkoff and Kushner, the command said in a statement.\n\nIranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told journalists Friday that “nuclear talks and the resolution of the main issues must take place in a calm atmosphere, without tension and without threats.” He said that diplomats would return to their capitals, signaling that this round of negotiations was over.\n\nOn Saturday, Araghchi told the Al Jazeera satellite news network that if the U.S. attacks Iran, his country doesn't have the ability to strike the U.S. “and therefore has to attack or retaliate against U.S. bases in the region.”\n\nHe said there is “very, very deep distrust” after what happened during the previous talks, when the U.S. bombed Iranian nuclear sites during last year's Israel-Iran war.\n\nAraghchi also said the “missile issue” and other defense matters are “in no way negotiable, neither now nor at any time in the future.”\n\nTehran has maintained that these talks will be only on its nuclear program.\n\nHowever, Al Jazeera reported that diplomats from Egypt, Turkey and Qatar offered Iran a proposal in which Tehran would halt enrichment for three years, send its highly enriched uranium out of the country and pledge to “not initiate the use of ballistic missiles.”\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that the talks needed to include all those issues.\n\nIsrael, a close U.S. ally, believes Iran is pursuing a nuclear weapon and wants its program scrapped, though Iran has insisted that its atomic plans are for peaceful purposes. Israel also wants a halt to Iran's ballistic missile program and its support for militant groups in the region.\n\nAraghchi, speaking at a forum in Qatar on Saturday, accused Israel of destabilizing the region, saying that it “breaches sovereignties, it assassinates official dignitaries, it conducts terrorist operations, it expands its reach in multiple theaters.” He criticized Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and called for “comprehensive and targeted sanctions against Israel, including an immediate arms embargo.”",

    "fullText": "Darron Lee, a former Chiefs linebacker, has been charged with the murder of his girlfriend, according to Tennessee authorities.\n\nThe Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office said deputies arrived Thursday at a residence in Ooltewah, Tennessee and found a female victim. After attempting CPR, it was determined she was deceased.\n\n“Due to the condition of the victim and the residence, HCSO Criminal Investigative Services Detectives responded. Preliminary findings indicate the victim’s death was the result of a homicide,” the sheriff’s office said in a statement.\n\n“The victim’s boyfriend, Darron Lee, was identified as the suspect and taken into custody at the scene.”\n\nLee, who played for the Chiefs in 2019, has been charged with first-degree murder and tampering with evidence. Lee was in 16 games that season, but he didn’t appear in the playoffs as the Chiefs won Super Bowl LIV.\n\nAccording to WRCB-TV in Chattanooga, “Lee told (first responders) that he had found her unconscious on the couch, and thought that she had perhaps fallen in the shower, but his statements didn’t line up with the ‘concerning conditions’ within the home, the arrest report says.\n\n“Deputies with the Hamilton County Sheriff’s Office say they found blood spatter on the walls and flooring in multiple locations, as well as broken glass scattered across the kitchen area. They also observed cleaning materials in ‘abnormal places.’”\n\nThe WRCB story said a medical examiner found the victim had a stab wound to the abdomen as well as a bruise on her head and other injuries.\n\nThe New York Post reported Lee is being held without bond and has a court date set for Wednesday.",

    "description": "Recent volatility in the precious metals market is causing headaches for businesses that play an essential role in the circulation of gold and silver.",
    "fullText": "Spot prices for silver and gold are stabilizing after a rocky stretch of record gains and losses.\n\nThe market volatility has caused headaches for local coin shops that typically buy precious metals.\n\n\"If you do this wrong, you run out of capital really fast,\" one shop told Business Insider.\n\nIf January was a party in the precious metals market, February is the hangover.\n\nThe per-ounce price of gold topped $5,300 and silver reached nearly $120 at the end of January before tumbling sharply. The stretch of record gains and losses has since stabilized in the early days of February.\n\n\"These price moves have done a lot of damage all across the line,\" HSBC precious metals analyst James Steel told Business Insider.\n\nOne type of business bearing the brunt of volatility is local coin shops, where people often trade in gold and silver. High prices have led to a huge influx of people selling, but some shops tell Business Insider they're running out of their usual places to offload excess metals.\n\nAs the market was in its tailspin, Tim Heuer said his shop, University Coin & Jewelry in Madison, Wisconsin, was still doing deals.\n\nHeuer said a customer came in to sell some silver when the spot price was $98 an ounce and falling: \"By the time I wrote his check, silver was already down $3.50 from the time he walked in the door.\"\n\nThe recent volatility is putting those businesses in an uncomfortable position, beyond quickly changing spot prices that erode profit margins.\n\nLocal coin shops play an essential role in the circulation of physical gold and silver by providing a reliable way for individuals to sell their bars, coins, or scrap metal.\n\nIf someone bought a gold bar last year from Costco and wants to turn it back into cash, a local coin shop is one of the first places they might go.\n\nAnd while these shops do turn around and sell some of what they buy, most of the metal is sold to refineries to be melted and minted into new bars or coins.\n\nThat flow has been interrupted in recent months as the run in gold and silver prices has encouraged more people to trade in their metals, leading to a backlog of raw materials at refineries.\n\nJarret Niesse, president of Precious Metal Refining Services in Chicago, said his company stopped buying scrap silver back in October, when the price crossed $50 per ounce, sparking a frenzy of people trading in old silverware, platters, and other tchotchkes that had been gathering dust.\n\nAnd the market has only gotten wilder since then.",

    "description": "Wales' 12th consecutive Six Nations loss in a run dating back to 2023 is more evidence of how far they have fallen.",
    "fullText": "As despondent Welsh fans drove out of Twickenham on Saturday evening, they would not have learned too much from Wales' 48-7 Six Nations hammering by England.\n\nThey already knew Welsh rugby was in turmoil and spiralling dangerously out of control.\n\nThey would have expected Steve Borthwick's side to overpower Wales at the Allianz Stadium. That is, of course, exactly what happened as ruthless England ran in seven tries.\n\nEngland have won their past 12 Test matches, while Wales have lost their previous 12 Six Nations internationals in a record stretching back to March 2023.\n\nSo these are two teams heading in different directions and at a significant speed.\n\nWales' passion cannot be questioned, with the players demonstrating afterwards just how much they cared. Wing Josh Adams was close to tears and captain Dewi Lake was honest in his declaration that the side had let both themselves and the nation down.\n\nIt is a heartbreaking but now familiar tale for Wales players and supporters, with little sign of shoots of recovery or any general optimism.\n\nWales have produced some woeful performances in a run of 22 Test defeats in 24 internationals since the end of 2023.\n\nThis dismal opening 40 minutes against England will take some beating though, as Wales equalled their worst half-time deficit of 29-0, the same score they trailed France in 1998.\n\n\"We want to be positive about this young Wales team,\" former Wales fly-half Dan Biggar told ITV.\n\n\"There's a new coaching group and staff but the level of performance in that first half was nowhere near the standard for international rugby.\"\n\nIt was that performance, rather than the result, that most disappointed Biggar.\n\n\"We're not saying Wales should be beating England or France because they are much better sides, but there's a performance expectation that comes when you put on that red jersey,\" he added.\n\n\"When you come to places like Twickenham, the performance level has to be much better.\n\n\"There's a way to lose and level of performance which Wales fell well short of in the first half.\"\n\nFormer Wales scrum-half Richie Rees told the Scrum V podcast: \"We didn't fire a shot.\n\n\"We did not put our imprint on the game and that is what they will be frustrated about.\"\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nArundell scores hat-trick as England heap misery on Wales\n\nWe let ourselves and people at home down - Lake\n\nAt the heart of the first-half capitulation was the dire discipline that has plagued the Tandy era.\n\nThere were four yellow cards against England, with front-row duo Lake and Nicky Smith sin-binned within a minute of each other in the first half.\n\nCardiff centre Ben Thomas and Scarlets flanker Taine Plumtree were shown yellow cards in the second half as Wales were reduced to 13 players on two occasions.\n\n\"Playing against England with 15 men is hard enough, let alone playing the game with 13 men for 20 minutes,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"We're not a good enough team to have these big lapses. We've got to be more accurate and I'm bitterly disappointed.\"\n\nWales conceded 10 penalties in the first 21 minutes, with 16 yielded in total. That was the most penalties conceded by Wales in a Test since 2009 when they gave away 18 against Ireland.\n\nIt has taken the total to 65 penalties in five matches under Tandy, with 10 yellow cards and one red issued.\n\nWales were under intense pressure but Rees believes some were avoidable.\n\n\"It is not possible to play international rugby and concede so many penalties,\" said Rees.\n\n\"That ill-discipline is something they can control. There was a variant in the type of penalty conceded and something they have to improve.\"\n\nIt was always going to be a tough start for Tandy in his first job as an international head coach but his first Six Nations game in charge ended in devastation.\n\nAfter taking over a side in the doldrums, Wales have now conceded 34 tries and 248 points in Tandy's first five games in charge, which will hurt the former Scotland defence coach.\n\n\"I knew when we took the job, it was not going to click overnight,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"We know where we're at and it's part of our journey but even though we're 11th in the world, we expect more of ourselves.\"\n\nOne aspect where Tandy could have more support from the WRU is his coaching staff, where he currently only has two permanent members in Matt Sherratt (attack) and Danny Wilson (forwards).\n\nTandy is an inexperienced national head coach, while Sherratt has been on the Test scene less than a year.\n\nTemporary trio Duncan Jones (scrum), Rhys Patchell (kicking) and Dan Lydiate (defence) were brought in for a second campaign after being involved last autumn.\n\nJones has since been forced to leave camp after suffering a freak serious injury in training, while Patchell and Lydiate are learning their trade having just finished playing.\n\nThe latest heavy defeat has again divided opinion on how crisis-ridden Welsh rugby attempts to transform itself.\n\nWelsh players are facing major off-field issues with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) threatening to cut a professional men's side and Ospreys under threat of disappearing as a top-tier team.\n\nAfter another embarrassing display this weekend there are some calling for the WRU hierarchy to resign, while others point out the result emphasises why change is needed.\n\nWRU board member and former Wales centre Jamie Roberts outlined the rationale.\n\n\"It's a challenging time, there is a performance and financial problem facing the game in Wales,\" Roberts told ITV.\n\n\"We made the decision in the best interests of the game in Wales to go to three teams. We want to see Welsh rugby thrive with club and national sides winning again.\n\n\"There are complexities how you get there and it's challenging for fans with uncertainty, but we're making the best decisions for the interests of the game in Wales medium to long-term.\"\n\nLake refused to use the off-field uncertainty as an excuse for the England debacle but Rees says the problems must be causing concern.\n\n\"When people get certainty, you have a start point and we don't have that at the moment,\" said Rees.\n\n\"Players, coaches and supporters don't know where they are. Whatever you say and no matter how much you try to park things, there is a knock-on effect.\"\n\nFrance arrive in Cardiff next Sunday with Wales searching for a first Six Nations home win in four years.\n\nThe calamitous state of Welsh rugby means the WRU is struggling to sell out their three home games this year, with thousands of tickets still available for next weekend.\n\nTandy hopes Wales will receive the usual home backing.\n\n\"The fans have been amazing support for the team,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"We know what it means to the boys to play in the Principality Stadium and the fans give them huge belief.\"\n\nWhether the Wales head coach will make changes remains to be seen as he balances reacting to an underwhelming display and the need to develop a settled side.\n\nHe says there would be no \"knee-jerk reaction\" and full-back Louis Rees-Zammit appears to have done enough to keep the number 15 jersey.\n\nThe former NFL triallist was making his first Six Nations appearance for almost three years and is settling into a new position after switching from the wing.\n\nAfter a shaky start where he had an early kick charged down, Rees-Zammit settled down and produced one searing second-half break.\n\n\"He did well in his first start at 15 in a while for us,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"In Test match rugby, there's not much space but I thought he adapted with the aerial battles.\n\n\"He's a big man and lit the game up in moments. It's looking how we can get more of those moments.\"\n\nSo maybe one thing for Welsh fans hold on to. There is currently not much more.",

    "description": "Supra du Quebec kick off their inaugural Canadian Premier League in April and will field only players born or raised in the province.",
    "fullText": "Rocco Placentino stood in front of Supra du Quebec's players, coaches and club management ready to deliver a speech before the club's first ever training session.\n\nAs the club's co-founder and president tried to find the words, he became emotional looking at what had been created and what was staring back at him.\n\nFormer Canada international Placentino saw a group of players and coaches all born or raised in Quebec, Canada.\n\nThey had been brought together, inspired by Bilbao's Athletic Club, to help put the only French-speaking province in Canada on the footballing landscape.\n\n\"It's done with local pride, local players, local staff, local upper management and local partnerships,\" said Placentino of Supra, who continue their pre-season preparation on Sunday before competing in the Canadian Premier League.\n\n\"Although it's not only talking about it but putting it into action, which we are doing. It's real, it's not a myth, it's not a fiction. It's truth, it's happening and we're extremely proud about this.\"\n\nPlacentino was raised in Montreal and played for Quebec's other professional football team, Major League Soccer side CF Montreal, as well as having spells in Italy's second and third divisions.\n\nWhile Montreal throw their scouting net across the world to be competitive, FC Supra are focusing on local players who may have overlooked.\n\nThey want to give other players from Quebec the chance to try and emulate Canadian internationals such as Saussolo's Ismael Kone and Nice's Moise Bombito.\n\nBombito was born in Montreal, while Kone moved to the city from the Ivory Coast aged seven, and their journeys highlight the rich cultural mix and football obsession found in Quebec.\n\n\"The objective is to have a local pride program in the Canadian Premier League, a team that could furnish players that are local and multicultural,\" said Placentino.\n\n\"I look at countries like Belgium and Iceland. If they're able to build players and sell them worldwide to become phenom footballers, why can't we do it in Quebec?\n\n\"A lot of players would fall through the cracks here and miss out on opportunities to shine and to be exposed at a higher level.\n\n\"All we need to do is take these ballers, put them in an environment that is very professional but also keeping that DNA of being street ballers.\"\n\nA unique touch showcasing Supra's pride in their province is having the Quebec flag printed on their kits.\n\nPaul Desbaillets, Supra's chief branding officer, says the aim was to bring Quebec's unique character to life.\n\n\"There's always been a history of Quebec versus Canada,\" he said.\n\n\"What makes us so proud exactly at this club is that here is more proof of why this province is so spectacular. We are a complete mix of French, Italian, British, Moroccan, Persian and Asian.\n\n\"It doesn't matter what ethnicity. We've formed together around Supra first and that's our melting pot of what Quebec is.\"\n\nSupra du Quebec may be a new club, that are yet to play a competitive game, but the idea of the club colours and name all stemmed from one of Montreal's first football teams.\n\nSupra Montreal only operated between 1988 and 1992, but provided the environment for a six-year-old Placentino to form some of his earliest footballing memories.\n\n\"I remember going to games with my father and watching players that were mainly local players playing for Supra Montreal,\" he said.\n\n\"I loved the colours. I loved the blue, white, and red.\n\n\"And I said, 'You know what? I want to relive that experience as now a founder of this club and bring back that local pride and that Quebec feeling'. We wanted to relive it and modernise it the best way we could.\"\n\nAlong with the colours and name, there is a more personal link between the two clubs through one of their new players, Alessandro Biello.\n\nWhat makes the 19-year-old's signing so special is that his dad, Mauro, played for the original Supra and captained Placentino while they played together at CF Montreal.\n\n\"When we signed [Alessandro] Biello every box was checked in terms of what we were looking for,\" said Placentino.\n\n\"The work ethic, bleeding for the colours, bleeding for the city, playing in front of his family and friends, having that drive to do well with the Supra, so that maybe one day he could be sold to a team in Europe.\n\n\"So for us it's a very proud moment to have Mauro's son play for Supra and hopefully he follows in his father's footsteps.\"\n\nQuebec is home to roughly nine million people. To represent FC Supra a player or coach has to have been born, raised or have a deep connection to the state.\n\nThis transfer policy is similar to Athletic Club's Basque-only approach, with Placentino hoping to visit the Spanish side to understand how growing a club using this transfer policy is possible.\n\nThe Supra president has already discovered some positives and negatives to running a policy like this, with the former Canada international having to reject more than 150 offers from players who had no connection to Quebec.\n\nBut despite a focus on growing local talent, there has also been interest from athletes who have moved away from Quebec to all corners of the globe but are keen to get involved with Supra.\n\n\"There are players who play in Guatemala, in Finland, in Iceland, in Sweden, in Malta that are all Quebec-based players and are saying, 'I want to come home',\" explained Placentino.\n\n\"They can't wait to come home and when you hear that, I get goosebumps.\"\n\nThis feelings of the players, coaches and management are shared by Placentino, which is why the club's motto is so poignant.\n\n\"Un club d'ici, pour ici.\" It translates to \"A club from here, for here.\"",

    "description": "World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses England's seven-try thrashing of Wales and the lessons coach Steve Borthwick can learn from France.",
    "fullText": "In his latest BBC Sport column, England World Cup winner Matt Dawson discusses England's seven-try thrashing of Wales, Tommy Freeman's performance at centre and the lessons coach Steve Borthwick could learn from his France counterpart.\n\nThere was a time, maybe a couple of years ago, when the England shirt used to weigh heavy on the players.\n\nThe pressure seemed to inhibit them. They were not expressing themselves. Everything was safety-first and a bit meek.\n\nNow, that England shirt seems to make the players double in size. They have embraced this team and this stage and are relishing showing the Allianz Stadium crowd what they are capable of.\n\nThey are enjoying their rugby. And we are enjoying watching them.\n\nPerversely, it is because the mood is so good around the team that coach Steve Borthwick and the players can be so focused on the bits and pieces which went wrong in the 48-7 win over Wales to open their Six Nations campaign.\n\nThere were no cartwheels or laps of honour after the final whistle. The players looked like they were happy with the win but focused on the next task - and aware that they will have to be better when they take on a wounded Scotland in Edinburgh on Saturday.\n\nTommy Freeman is rapidly approaching world-class status.\n\nThe package that he brings to Test rugby - the pace, size, aerial ability and appetite for the ball - is pretty special.\n\nHe was a starter for the British and Irish Lions in all three Tests against Australia in the summer and he is inked into this England team as one of those who will always have a place when fit.\n\nHowever, there is a question over which number Borthwick will write next to Freeman's name.\n\nThis was Freeman's 23rd England appearance but only his third as a centre.\n\nConsidering that relatively paltry midfield experience, he was pretty damn good against Wales.\n\nHe hit superb lines, either hitting the ball up bravely into the heart of Wales defence or acting as a decoy, and worked instinctively with Northampton team-mate Fraser Dingwall inside him at 12.\n\nThey are turning into a dangerous and cohesive pairing - and England have been crying out for a midfield combination with those qualities for ages.\n\nWhere once the supply of centres was quite low, there are now a bunch of alternatives.\n\nOllie Lawrence, who is working his way back from a minor knee injury, may be available for Scotland. Max Ojomoh was very impressive against Argentina in the autumn. Seb Atkinson has credit in the bank from his performances on the summer tour of Argentina.\n\nIt means England can mix and match according to the opposition.\n\nDo they want a punch in midfield or the ability to distribute quickly into wide channels? Gas around the outside or the ability to probe behind with kicks?\n\nThe ability to change tactics with different midfield selection is very, very exciting.\n\nSouth Africa - the gold standard for everyone in world rugby at the moment - have the same.\n\nThe mix of Damian de Allende, Jesse Kriel, Canan Moodie, Damian Willemse and even Andre Esterhuizen gives them different ways of playing.\n\nThat adaptability is a fantastic attribute for any team.\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nSame old story for sorry Wales in Six Nations\n\nInevitably, Henry Arundell's first-half hat-trick for England caught the eye against Wales, but it will have been the smaller details that most impressed Borthwick.\n\nDefensively, Arundell has been questioned in the past, but he was strong in that area against Wales.\n\nWhen you see him up close, he is strong and solid, as well as fast. He packs 15st 2lb into a 6ft frame and is physical and intimidating in defence. But he is also canny.\n\nHis positioning was good against Wales. He did not step out of shape and get isolated, as he has done previously.\n\nHis six months or so at Bath, under Johann van Graan and defence coach JP Ferreira, have really brought Arundell's game on in that respect.\n\nLate in the game, with England well over the horizon and the win secure, he also came in off his wing, looking for work and holes to exploit with his pace.\n\nThat is another side of his game that is developing. He is no longer only hanging out on the edge, waiting for the ball to come to him.\n\nAfter France and England's dominant first-round performances, the expectation around their final-round meeting in Paris on 14 March has risen another notch.\n\nBut you would be foolish to draw a straight line from this opening weekend to a Grand Slam decider on the final one.\n\nThere are going to be tougher moments for each side before that. The test will be how they react to being under the pump, away from home in tricky conditions. Scotland showed how hard that can be during their defeat by Italy on Saturday.\n\nBorthwick will not be looking too far ahead, but one lesson he can already take from France is the ability to create competitive internal environments.\n\nOpposite number Fabien Galthie shook up his squad selection for the tournament, leaving out established players Damian Penaud, Gael Fickou and Gregory Alldritt. Perhaps they will come back in for later fixtures. Perhaps not.\n\nBut the new faces - and the sense of playing for your place - pushed France to a great performance against Ireland.\n\nBorthwick now has the depth to be as bold in his team selection. That is a wonderful place to be.",

    "fullText": "Ernesto Valverde accepted that Athletic Club’s meeting with Levante on Sunday is set to be a crucial game for both sides, who find themselves in precarious positions with 22 games played.\n\nThe Zurigorri, who finished fourth in LaLiga last season, haven’t hit their usual heights during the first half of the league campaign. They sit 17 points adrift of the top four, and with just 3 points separating them from the drop zone, they face the very real threat of being dragged into the relegation battle.\n\nIn his pre-match press conference, Valverde stressed that “everything depends on one or two results.”\n\nLevante are already well and truly in that relegation fight, but could move one step closer to survival with victory at the San Mamés – and the 61-year-old warned that they are “coming back to life” after positive results since the turn of the year.\n\nHe explained: “They won against Sevilla, drew with Atlético Madrid, came back from behind against Elche, and made it very difficult for Real Madrid.\n\n“They’re a team that defends together and gets well forward, with rapid players and good passers. They’re a difficult opponent to beat. They’re very cohesive and press you well; it’s a very difficult, very uncomfortable match.”\n\nThe pressure could really mount on Valverde if Athletic Club do not emerge victorious on Sunday. The Zurigorri‘s last LaLiga win came against Atlético Madrid on 6 December, making for six league games without a win. It has been more than four years since the Basque side last went on a seven-game winless run.\n\n“The match against Levante is extremely important for us, and for them as well,” Valverde accepted.\n\n“We urgently need the win and will give everything to achieve it. Every month is crucial, and this month we have a certain type of opponent, but I’m not looking beyond this match — it’s the one that matters and where our focus is.”\n\nAthletic Club v Levante kicks off at San Mamés at 15:15 GMT on Sunday 8 February.",

    "fullText": "Andrei Arlovski still has Ben Rothwell's number and has added another championship to his storied resume.\n\nIn the main event of BKFC: KnuckleMania 6, former UFC champ Arlovski met incoming BKFC heavyweight champ for the third time in combat sports – the first time in bareknuckle boxing. Arlovski won the first two fights in MMA and has now won the third in a different sport. The official result was a TKO stoppage due to cuts at 1:14 of Round 3.\n\nRothwell appeared more hesitant than ever before in the BKFC ring, and Arlovski took full advantage. Arlovski brought the fight to Rothwell, shoving him hard into the rigid ropes and clipping him with a few clean punches in Round 1.\n\nArlovski was quicker to the punch in Round 2 as well, opening up a nasty cut. In the closing seconds, Arlovski charged forward with a brutal combination, sending Rothwell reeling into the ropes. He didn't go down, but was clearly hurt from the accurate right hands.\n\nBefore the start of the third round, the referee had the doctor check on Rothwell, but the action continued. Rothwell struggled to deal with Arlovski's speed and accuracy. The fight was paused with less than a minute to go in the round so the doctor could take another look at the gashes on Rothwell's face – and that's where it would end.\n\nAndrei Arlovski makes it 3-0 in combat sports vs. Ben Rothwell, this time to claim the BKFC heavyweight title at age 47. #KM6\n\n🎥 @bareknucklefc pic.twitter.com/R6Q39G9CG4\n\n— MMA Junkie (@MMAJunkie) February 8, 2026\n\nThe pair first met in MMA at Affliction 1 in July 2008. Arlovski won that meeting by TKO in the third round. The rematch took place at UFC on ESPN 4 over a decade later. Once again, Arlovski got his hand raised, that time by unanimous decision.\n\nArlovski, 47, has not lost in competition since exiting the UFC in 2024. Since, he's won four total fights by stoppage; two in BKFC, one in Dirty Boxing Championship, and an exhibition boxing bout under the Misfits Boxing banner.\n\nRothwell, 44, ripped through the competition in BKFC after his UFC exit. He claimed the heavyweight title in his fourth fight by stopping Mick Terrill in just 36 seconds last January. However, his fantastic run came to a halt at the knuckles of a familiar foe.\n\nAndrei Arlovski def.

    "fullText": "Trent Perry scored 23 points, including clutch free throws down the stretch, Tyler Bilodeau overcame foul trouble to score 19, Donovan Dent had 17 points and 10 assists and Eric Dailey Jr. scored 14 as UCLA held off Washington 77-73 Saturday night in a Big Ten clash at Pauley Pavilion.\n\nAhead of a pivotal Midwest trip to No. 2 Michigan and No. 10 Michigan State starting on Valentine's Day, the Bruins wrapped up their three-game homestand on a positive note after splitting the first two, a one-point, double-overtime loss to Indiana followed by a 22-point blowout of Rutgers in which five players scored in double digits.\n\nThe Bruins (17-7, 9-4) struggled against Washington much as they did in the teams’ first meeting Dec. 3 in Seattle, when they escaped with an 82-80 victory thanks to 25 points (including six three-pointers) by Skyy Clark, who has sat out the past 10 games with a hamstring injury.\n\nA winner in 10 of its last 14 games, UCLA will not host its next game until a Feb. 21 matchup with fifth-ranked Illinois.\n\nWesley Yates III scored 12 of the Huskies’ first 16 points as they built an eight-point lead in the first eight minutes. The Bruins pulled ahead 25-23 on Perry’s three pointer with 6:15 left in the half that capped a 9-0 run, but Washington carried a 34-30 lead to the locker room — the first time UCLA trailed at halftime since its loss at Ohio State on Jan. 17.\n\nBilodeau, who scored only four points in the first 20 minutes, hit a three pointer 10 seconds into the second half and added another to tie the score at 38. Dent stole the ball at midcourt and drove for a layup to put UCLA in front 47-45 with 13:43 remaining and the Bruins gradually increased the lead while holding the Huskies without a field goal for nearly five minutes.\n\nWashington crept to within 60-58 with 5:39 left on a layup by Yates before Bilodeau’s basket and free throw restored a five-point cushion at the 4:40 mark. Dent’s driving layup made it 67-60 with 1:33 left and the Bruins improved to 13-3 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nYates finished with 21 points and Hannes Steinbach added 13 for the Huskies (12-12, 4-9), who cut their deficit to two on a layup and free throw by Yates with 23 seconds left. Dailey got fouled and made both shots to make it 75-71 with 21 ticks left. After a layup by Yates with 11 seconds left, Perry sank two free throws to ice the victory four seconds later.\n\nThe Bruins were 23 of 29 at the foul line and remain on pace to break the school single-season record for best free throw percentage (75.6) set in 1978-79.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

Harden did an excellent job running Cleveland’s pick-and-roll, but it took some time for him to be start scoring the rock.\n\nTravis Scott crashed James Harden and Donovan Mitchell's postgame interview after the Cavs win 😭\n\n pic.twitter.com/5mgfMWEzEf\n\n— Kurrco (@Kurrco) February 8, 2026\n\nHarden officially welcomed himself to the Cavaliers by pouring in 15 points in the fourth quarter. He and Mitchell combined for a whopping 32 points in the final frame, escaping Sacramento with a win (and delivering a Travis Scott endorsement with him).\n\nWe’ve partnered with Homage to help provide Cavs fans with the best gear. Anything bought from the links below helps support Fear the Sword while also allowing you to rep the Cavs. You can also shop all Homage Cavs gear HERE.\n\nYou can grab the Mobley shirt seen above HERE.\n\nThe Mobley trading card shirt can be bought HERE.\n\n29 points, 10 rebounds, 1 assist\n\nProps to Allen. He’s not only carried additional weight with Evan Mobley on the sidelines, but he’s found a new pick-and-roll partner in Harden who can get him more involved than ever before. This was an awesome glimpse at a two-man game that I can’t wait to watch develop. Allen shot 11-12 tonight, starting the game 11-11.\n\n10 points, 0 assists, 6 rebounds, 3 turnovers\n\nA lot was going on in this game. Tyson never found his role in it all. He finished with a minus-27 in nearly 30 minutes. That’s tough to do in a game you won.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\n6 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals, 1 block, 17 minutes\n\nI would have liked more Ellis in this game. His defensive playmaking and three-point shooting are skills that fit any lineup. Kenny Atkinson eventually decided he agreed, closing this game with Ellis.\n\n6 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists\n\nTomlin is still getting ignored by opposing defenses. That led to some clunky spacing in his minutes. But, as is the story of the season, his energy and activity keep Tomlin as one of the team’s highest plus/minus players. He finished as a plus 16 tonight.\n\n7 points, 4 assists, 3 rebounds\n\nSchroder’s scrappy style is going to fit right in with Cleveland’s bench. He had a few instances of tunnel vision (3-9 shooting) tonight. Other than that, Schroder was a serviceable backup guard.\n\nMerrill has done a lot to earn some benefit of the doubt when he has a poor shooting night. He’s usually able to be effective even when his shots aren’t falling. But I don’t think anything was working for Sam tonight. He finished 0-6 from the floor.\n\n4 points, 4 assists, 3 rebounds, 2 steals\n\nThis wasn’t a great game for Porter. His lack of shooting can be crippling on the offense when his defense isn’t making up for it. He contributed as a playmaker and even swiped a few steals, but Porter was overall too out of place for me to feel good about his performance.\n\n10 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists\n\nBryant nailed back-to-back three-pointers in the first half. After that, his mobility became a serious liability for the Cavaliers’ defense. It is what it is. We knew this was a limitation for TB.",

    "title": "Winners and Losers: Cavs at Kings – James Harden ushers in new era",
    "description": "Harden’s first game as a Cavalier was a good one.",
    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers took over in the fourth quarter to win a thriller in Sacramento. Let’s see who won and lost the night.\n\nThis one came down to the wire. That’s in part because of Sacramento’s lights-out shooting and Cleveland’s poor rebounding. But when push came to shove, the Cavs had two stars they could turn to.\n\nDonovan Mitchell and James Harden combined for 32 points in the fourth quarter, just when the team needed it most. It was devastating shot after devastating shot, as Mitchell got the ball rolling before Harden buried the Kings with his three-point shooting.\n\nThis wasn’t seamless. Mitchell and Harden took turns dicing up the Kings in a game where they might have led earlier if they had more synergy between each other. But hey, it’s their first game together. It took both Mitchell and Harden a few quarters to find each other’s groove. But with one prolific quarter, we saw how special this duo can be.\n\nThere’s a new maestro in town, and he has a big fuzzy beard.\n\nHarden is one of the best playmakers in the NBA. That’s something you probably already knew. But until you see him in a Cavs uniform dishing the ball to some of your favorite players — you don’t really understand just how great he is.\n\nThis wasn’t anything incredible. Harden finished with 23 points and 8 assists. But he consistently delivered the ball to his teammates in the pick-and-roll. Harden was finding them on their way to the rim, whether it be Jarrett Allen, Jaylon Tyson, or Craig Porter.\n\nHarden’s instincts as a 6’5” dimer give this offense a new wrinkle. He shredded Sacramento’s attempts at trapping him, showing supreme poise in accepting the pressure and then getting the ball out at precisely the right time. He’s a basketball savant who is now surrounded by connective passers and competent play finishers.\n\nThe Cavaliers have always, in my opinion, been at their best when the offense is leading the charge. Sure, they’ve had the backbone of a defensive team for years, but it’s their offensive explosions that took them from good to great last season.\n\nGetting back to that level hasn’t been easy. Injuries and poor shooting held them back early in the season. But now? They have a brand new engine that’s ready to get them burning rubber again.\n\nI’ll cut the Cavs a little bit of slack. You can’t always control when the other team has an outlier night shooting the ball. For example, Russell Westbrook and Nique Clifford are shooting below 35% from deep this season, yet they combined for 9-13 shooting in the first three quarters.\n\nNo one else on the Kings had more than one three-pointer entering the fourth quarter. That’s tough.\n\nWestbrook and Clifford’s outlier nights almost single-handedly kept the Kings in this one. But I can’t completely dismiss this as poor shooting luck for the Cavs. After all, it’s their job to contest and limit shots. Especially once an opponent is in a rhythym.\n\nCleveland’s rotations were a step slow tonight. Their defensive rebounding was also an issue, as the Kings had 15 offensive rebounds. Tighter rotations and a better effort on the glass would have cleaned up a handful of the open three-point attempts Sacramento generated.\n\nSpeaking of Harden’s passing in the pick-and-roll, let’s talk about the player who will benefit the most from the Beard’s arrival.\n\nAllen is going to be living in paradise for the foreseeable future. It felt like he received a paint touch on every screen he set for Harden, often catching the ball with enough space to go straight up for a layup. That’s a testament to Harden’s threat as a scorer, as the Kings spent more time worrying about him than covering Allen’s roll.\n\nBut I don’t want to give Harden all of the credit.\n\nWe’ve seen that Allen can be a crafty and creative finisher around the rim. Getting the ball to him in the short roll is one part of the equation. From there, we saw Allen score using his post-hook, drop-step, and up-and-under move.\n\nAllen finished with 29 points, 10 rebounds, and didn’t miss on his first 11 shot attempts.\n\nThe Cavs have leaned on Allen heavily with Evan Mobley on the sidelines. He’s taken more offensive responsibility in stride and deserves all the credit in the world for holding down the fort.",

    "fullText": "As Drake Maye prepares for the biggest game of his life, one of the most unexpected storylines of his Super Bowl run has nothing to do with football. It has everything to do with his wife, Ann Michael Maye.\n\nOver the past year, Ann Michael has quietly become a fan favorite, known for her warm personality, baking content, and behind-the-scenes support of her husband. What started as casual social media posts and lighthearted moments has now grown into something much bigger, a spotlight she never asked for, but has embraced with grace.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Super Bowl LX, Maye admitted he’s been amazed by how quickly fans have connected with her.\n\n“I’m more surprised at how much people have embraced my wife,” Maye said. “It’s been so cool to see her story and what it’s been like for her.” These days, the quarterback finds himself playing second fiddle in public.\n\n“She’s the one out at restaurants having to take pictures,” Maye joked. “And I’m the one laughing in the back.”\n\nAnn Michael’s rise in popularity has been gradual but genuine. Long before Maye became a Super Bowl quarterback, she was already earning fans through her baking videos, family moments, and down-to-earth presence online. Supporters were drawn to her authenticity, a refreshing contrast to the polished image often associated with pro athletes’ partners. Now, that connection has reached another level.\n\n“At games, walking around the stadium, it’s awesome for her,” Maye said. “She’s getting bombarded.” Rather than feeling overwhelmed, he sees it as something meaningful. “That’s really special for the fan base,” he added, “and for us to share the same journey and be in the spotlight together.”\n\nFor Maye, having his wife alongside him through this rapid rise has made the experience more grounding than stressful. While Ann Michael has been winning over fans, Maye remains focused on the task at hand: facing a fast, disciplined Seattle defense in the Super Bowl.\n\n“They’re fast. They play as a team,” he said. “You can tell they’re well coached. They do things the right way.” He made it clear that Seattle has earned its reputation. “They’ve earned the respect of the league,” Maye said. “It’s a tough challenge, but I know our locker room has responded all year.”\n\nThat confidence reflects the maturity Maye has shown throughout the postseason. Despite the pressure, he has rarely looked rattled, relying on preparation and trust in his teammates. When asked about his approach to such a massive game, Maye emphasized simplicity over spectacle.\n\n“Keep it simple,” he said. “Sometimes it’s just about not turning the ball over.” He credited head coach Josh McDaniels for helping him stay grounded. “Coach is so good about understanding how the game’s going,” Maye explained. “The weather, the flow, everything.”\n\nSome nights call for explosive numbers. Others demand patience.\n\n“Sometimes you throw for 350,” Maye said. “Sometimes you just protect the ball. And you end up going to the Super Bowl.” Stats, he insists, are secondary. “We’re not worried about that,” he concluded. “We’re worried about winning.”\n\nThe post “She’s Getting Bombarded”: Drake Maye Raves About Ann Michael Maye Factor Before Super Bowl appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "title": "On This Day (8 Feb 1936): Sunderland Do Their Fallen Teammate Proud",
    "description": "Back in action after the death of Jimmy Thorpe, professionalism helped pay tribute to a departed colleague…",
    "fullText": "With a sixth Football League championship confirmed, 1936 should have been a time of pure joy at Sunderland AFC, but the Lads’ title win will always be marked by a massive sense of sadness due to the tragic loss of popular team member Jimmy Thorpe just weeks before the trophy was handed over.\n\nSuccess was eventually confirmed midway through April, yet at this stage any thoughts of glory were secondary following the tragic news of Thorpe’s death on the fifth — just four days after his final appearance — amid a bruising encounter against Chelsea during which the rough treatment he sustained led to complications with his diabetes.\n\nA brave and extremely talented goalkeeper, Thorpe had been admitted to Monkwearmouth and Southwick Hospital after the weekend of the game.\n\nHe’d left Roker Park following the match, the closing stages of which saw him appear to be dazed and having to lean against his posts in order to remain upright, and spent the immediate hours afterwards in his bed. By Wednesday, several supporters had made inquiries to the hospital and offices of the Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette as to his condition, but at around 14:00, he passed away surrounded by his relatives.\n\nLater that afternoon, a reserve fixture against West Stanley took place at Roker, with spectators standing bare-headed and observing a two-minute period of silence prior to kick off.\n\nThe players, meanwhile, wore black ‘armlets’ although the first team squad weren’t present as they were already en route to Southport to prepare for their next game. The severity of his illness had only been brought to the attention of the travelling party at lunchtime, at which point the group sent a telegram to Thorpe’s wife expressing hope that their great mate would soon recover.\n\nRemarkably, and despite the understandable grief, there appears to have been no suggestion that the next game at Liverpool was to be postponed.\n\nThings moved quickly, with the coroner opening the inquest into Thorpe’s passing less than 24 hours after his death, and whilst that was soon adjourned the players were still expected to carry on as if nothing had happened.\n\nMatt Middleton — who was initially brought to the club in 1934 when Thorpe had spent time in Sunderland Royal Infirmary — was drafted back into the starting eleven for his first senior outing in over a year, and in bitterly cold conditions at Anfield, the Lads found themselves in the difficult position of having to focus on their football despite having had little time to come to terms with the heartache.\n\nLining up for the hosts was defender Jim Harley, who as well as being a footballer was a successful sprinter.\n\nAlthough he’d won that year’s famous Powderhall Handicap race (running under a pseudonym), it was the visitors that came flying out of the blocks, going ahead after two minutes when Bobby Gurney jumped on a mishit back pass and put the ball away.\n\nThe error owed something to the slippery surface and that continued to impact play, with Jack Balmer soon wasting a golden opportunity to level things up when he blasted wide from a few yards out. Sunderland however were able to keep their balance slightly more, and scored again from a superb Bert Davis corner, with Patsy Gallacher placing an inch-perfect header into the net.\n\nAs if fuelled by their pain, the Lads kept the pressure on at 0-2 and wrapped things up midway through the first half.\n\nA flowing move saw Jimmy Connor and Raich Carter moving possession out wide, and from there Davis played another excellent cross into the box to be knocked down by Gallacher and turned in by Gurney. The finish itself was simple but the timing of the run and the buildup play made this a superb goal and a suitable tribute to Thorpe, who was again remembered through black armbands.\n\nMiddleton, although thankful for a Tom Morrison clearance off the line and to see a Vic Wright effort hit the post, had a relatively easy time of it and it was his opposite number Arthur Riley that was the busier, even after the break when Sunderland went into a more conservative mode.\n\nA late knock to Jimmy Clark forced a bit of a reshuffle with the centre half playing out the final minutes out on the wing, yet the players drew together once more and saw things out — the clean sheet not only honouring Thorpe’s memory but that of Sunderland great Charlie Thomson, who’d also passed away in the week (Thursday 6 February).\n\nA photograph of Scotland defender Thomson, who spent a period running the Wheatsheaf pub close to where the Stadium of Light now stands following his retirement and was subsequently buried at Mere Knolls Cemetery, was included on the front page of Saturday evening’s Football Echo alongside a set of results and tables that showed Sunderland at the Division One summit, their lead being extended to seven points due to chasers Derby County and Huddersfield Town both failing to win.\n\nGlory was clearly on the horizon but at this moment, the Lads just wanted to pay tribute to their mate.\n\nSunderland 3 (Gurney 2’, 21’, Gallacher 18’)\n\nSunderland: Middleton, Morrison, Hall; Thomson, Clark, Hastings; Davis, Carter, Gurney; Gallacher, Connor",

    "description": "“It is now eight away games without a win on the road, and while our home form is imperious, the formula to get three points on the road needs to be found”, writes James Nickels.",
    "fullText": "This is a really difficult game to unpack — for large parts we competed as equals with arguably the best team in world football, yet the scoreline reads a 3-0 loss. A third away loss in which we have conceded three.\n\nWhile two of Arsenal’s goals contained pieces of genuinely top-quality play, for the most part, we limited them to a number of small chances, with each side’s xG pretty similar (1.02 v 1.03). I don’t really care for xG; it is a quantitative metric that can hardly be realistically quantified — what the hell does it actually mean in real-world terms? But here it is a useful barometer. We barely gave them real chances in earnest, and barely had any ourselves.\n\nOmar Alderete was suspect for both goals — the first emanated from a poor giveaway in his own defensive third, and he looked to have allowed Viktor Gyökeres far too much space as he scored the second, yet I really find it difficult to actually blame him for either. That finish from Martin Zubimendi quite literally hit the one part of the goal (or post) that would actually lead to a goal, and Leandro Trossard (the Premier League’s premium underrated player) created the second with a world-class through ball.\n\nThe third, while an effective counter-attack, came purely from us pushing to score, and immediately after what I thought was a penalty for Saliba dragging down Dan Ballard to the ground with both of his arms. It was an undeserved result which flatters the hosts. Yet, regardless of that, their quality shone through. Many of their players are truly world-class in their passing range and shooting that was shown on the day, and trying to break that defence is like just hitting a brick wall after some promising interplay in the middle of midfield.\n\nMany of us had hope, but probably very few actually thought we would win today. Arsenal seem to be picking up momentum and are one of the most well-drilled teams I’ve seen in a long time. They look formidable in defence and manage to find a way through stubborn defences.\n\nWe created probably just one real chance ourselves — Brian Brobbey’s potentially-going-wide shot in the first ten minutes, which was cleared off the line, but still looked to be quite competitive in midfield, defence and from set pieces. Brobbey himself battled well all afternoon, getting the best of William Saliba, annoying the hell out of every Arsenal fan in the stadium and had the league’s most physical, dominant force bouncing off him from Enfield to Islington. Yet again, we sit here after another x-goals-to-three loss.\n\nThere were some very strong performances throughout the side; Nordi Mukiele and Reinildo got the better of their wingers for the most part, Robin Roefs and Dan Ballard were dominant in the air, and others further up battled and linked up well. Yet we didn’t do much in attack. Arsenal’s goals were all genuine quality, but also all felt a bit soft. It’s been a weird afternoon of oxymorons. A good performance, yet a poor result. A promising day, yet another loss on the road.\n\nAgain, we stopped their set-piece threat. Arsenal’s 0.19 xG from set-pieces is their second-lowest in a game this season (the lowest was us at the SoL). And again, I apologise for the use of xG, but in a baffling afternoon, where I’m actually not absolutely fuming that we just lost 3-0, and probably quite enthused by our overall performance, it is helping provide clarity.\n\nOne positive from the day was the late introduction of Nilson Angulo, who did not look out of place at all. He came on and played on the right wing to see the game out and looked bright in spells. What was mostly self-evident, though, was his willingness to defend, track back and physicality in challenges. Something that always eluded Simon Adingra during his time on Wearside, and a non-negotiable for Régis Le Bris.\n\nWhat is self-evident is that we are not getting relegated. But if we really want to dream big and aim for Europe, this away form must be rectified. Missing Xhaka is an enormous factor, with 50% of the away games in which we have conceded three or more all coming during his absence, but it is bigger than that. It is now eight away games without a win on the road, and while our home form is imperious, the formula to get three points on the road needs to be found.\n\nBut if we put in this type of overall performance at home to Liverpool on Wednesday, I’d be pretty confident of finding a result.",

    "fullText": "Last night (Sat., Feb. 7, 2026), Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) returned home to the Meta APEX in Las Vegas, Nevada for UFC Vegas 113. Luckily, the first “Fight Night” event of 2026 was a step up from the average APEX affair. There were intriguing bouts booked throughout the evening featuring some quality prospects and familiar faces alike. The night kicked off with a couple impressive comebacks on the “Prelims,” and the action remained high throughout the evening, almost all the way to the pivotal Bantamweight main event.\n\nLet’s take a look back over the best performances and techniques of the evening:\n\nI’m having a tough time making heads or tails of Mario Bautista vs. Vinicius Oliveira.\n\nUndoubtedly, it’s a great performance and win from Bautista, who pretty much dominated the fight and won a main event without taking any hard punches to the face. There’s no question he brought a smart game plan and excellent transitional work to the cage with him, getting Oliveira to play his game and then quickly showing himself the finer man in that aspect.\n\nAll the questions surround “Lokdog.” The Brazilian made the bizarre decision of shooting just seconds into the fight against the man known to be the better grappler? Then continued to proactively wrestle? Weirder yet, Oliveira is known for his deep gas tank. He’s made a UFC career out of outlasting opposition, taking their best punches and/or takedowns early and then drowning them later.\n\nBeing an absurdly gifted athlete is Oliveira’s whole thing.\n\nIn this fight, conversely, Oliveira was exhausted just a minute into round two … and he didn’t really do that much in the first! I cannot help but think that his absurd weight cut severely drained him and robbed us of a more competitive fight. If that’s the case, it’s high time for “Lokdog” to either figure out how to cut in a healthier fashion or make the move up to 145 pounds.\n\nFor the second time in three months, 35-year-old Kyoji Horiguchi absolutely styled on a top-ranked Flyweight contender.\n\nSeriously, Horiguchi beat the brakes off Albazi and made it look pretty easy. Despite a clear size advantage and decorated wrestling pedigree, Albazi couldn’t floor Horiguchi a single time. He was forced to chase after the Karateka, and it did not at all go well for him. Horiguchi’s timing and movement patterns are so unlike everybody else that the Japanese striker was routinely able to line up hard shots that Albazi didn’t see coming and was forced to just absorb.\n\nThe damage built up quickly, and by the end of the fight, Albazi was covered in blood and had been rocked badly on multiple occasions. The finish didn’t materialize, but this was one-way traffic from pretty much the first bell.\n\nIn particular, Horiguchi’s lead hand looked great here. His jab repeatedly interrupted Albazi’s would-be pressure and stood him up tall, leaving him more vulnerable to follow-up right hand swings. As Albazi changed his guard to adjust for the jab, Horiguchi started sitting down behind wide counter left hooks that clipped the temple and did major damage.\n\nThe Flyweight division is hot right now with multiple options for champion Joshua Van’s first title defense. Given Horiguchi’s age and overall accomplishments as a world-class champion, I’m in favor of booking “The Karate Kid” for a title shot quickly while he’s still performing at such a high level — there’s no chance Van vs. Horiguchi wouldn’t be absolute fireworks.\n\nJailton Almeida vs. Rizvan Kuniev was a horribly frustrating fight but not entirely for the reason one might expect.\n\nBased on his pair of fights with Curtis Blaydes and Almeida, Kuniev was genetically engineered in a Russia lab to shut down the takedown attempts of elite Heavyweight wrestlers. Sadly, he was not engineered to do anything else. In this fight, Kuniev routinely shut down Almeida’s previously unstoppable double leg with absolute ease and then proceeded to do NOTHING! He spent so much time in the clinch with his forehead driven up into Almeida’s chin in perfect position to rip the liver, dig knees, break with elbows or right hands and a vast majority of the time he just … stayed there.\n\nAlmeida wasn’t much better. In the second round, for example, he landed a big calf kick that nearly knocked Kuniev to the floor and then proceeded to never throw that kick again. His right hand and front kick looked good when he threw them, which was incredibly rare. Worse yet, he would randomly just back himself into the fence and concede long periods of clinch time.\n\nKuniev picked up the nod, which is a big win if you look at the rankings and completely meaningless if you actually watched the fight. After those 15 minutes, who f—king cares about the judges’ scorecards? This was truly awful Heavyweight fighting just one week after the Tuivasa vs. Teixeira embarrassment at UFC 325. This division has never been worse, and there is no rebuild happening.\n\nVeteran referee Dan Miragliotta celebrated his 500th appearance as a UFC ref last night in appropriate fashion: with a hilariously bad stoppage!\n\nDustin Jacoby vs. Julius Walker was a decent veteran vs. prospect scrap. Jacoby was clearly the better kickboxer by a significant margin and was sticking Walker with good straight punches, but Walker showed in the first round why he was a live dog with some powerful slam takedowns. It was a good display of chain wrestling and physicality from the young talent, attributes we don’t often see at 205 pounds.\n\nStill, Jacoby was a step too far for the up-and-comer. Jacoby connected on a big right hand early in the second and then unleashed hell, putting Walker down hard with another right. Miragliotta moved in to stop the fight, pulled away at the last second, and Walker was hit another couple dozen times for his indecision. Even when Walker was turning away from the punches — a clear sign referees are supposed to look for that indicates the fight is over — Miragliotta still allowed the 7-2 professional to eat more punches.\n\nAnother good performance from Jacoby, who has won four straight, and exactly what we’ve come to expect from everyone’s favorite hallucinating referee.\n\nNikolay Veretennikov defeats Niko Price via first-round knockout (highlights): I am sad to say Price appears to be completely washed. Veretennikov entered this fight with an underwhelming 1-3 UFC record and then looked like a world beater against “The Hybrid.” He chewed up Price’s midsection with some violent clinch knees then went upstairs with a barrage of right hands and right elbows to secure a dramatic standing knockout win. Given that this is Price’s third straight defeat and fifth loss in his last six, it’s hard to really be that impressed by Veretennikov.\n\nJakub Wiklacz defeats Muin Gafurov via third-round guillotine choke (highlights): We have an early candidate for Submission of the Year, and it came at the conclusion of a pretty great scrap! Gafurov started strong, pressuring forward with combinations to box up Wiklacz, who has a definite bit of Reinier de Ridder to his stand-up game (derogatory). He’s very slick on the canvas, however, and Wiklacz used a guillotine choke to reverse his way into top position in round two. He spent most of that frame in top position, threatening submissions and landing some chipping ground shots. With the scorecards tied up, Gafurov stuck to his boxing and really ripped up the body for most of five minutes. In the closing seconds, he shot for a double leg along the fence and wound up in another guillotine! Wiklacz fully committed to the squeeze and forced the tap with less than one second remaining, earning the unlikely comeback at the last second. Strange style or not, Wiklacz is now 2-0 in the UFC with a pair of wins over pretty damn good Bantamweights.",

    "fullText": "A controversial livestreamer has been barred from attending PGA Tour events indefinitely after being removed from the Waste Management Phoenix Open, a person familiar with the matter told the Guardian, though the tour has declined to publicly confirm any specific disciplinary action.\n\nSecurity and law enforcement removed Jack Doherty from the tournament grounds on Friday after he appeared to pay a spectator to shout during a player’s pre-shot routine, according to videos circulating online and accounts of the incident.\n\n“The WM Phoenix Open is a bucket-list event with one of the most unique fan experiences in all of sport,” a PGA Tour spokesperson said. “The PGA Tour and the Thunderbirds are committed to protecting the integrity of the competition and providing an exceptional experience for all fans. Disruptive fan behavior will not be tolerated and anyone violating the Fan Code of Conduct is subject to immediate ejection.\n\n“We appreciate the swift action of tournament security and local law enforcement to identify and address disruptive behavior.”\n\nDoherty, a 22-year-old streamer known for filming confrontational public pranks, with titles including “I crashed into a cop car” and “I got banned from Disney”, has amassed an enormous online following through high-energy stunt and reaction livestreams, content that platform algorithms often amplify because it generates strong engagement through confrontation, shock and unpredictability.\n\nHe was removed from the tournament grounds after appearing to encourage a spectator to shout as the golfer Mackenzie Hughes addressed the ball from a fairway bunker in exchange for money, according to videos circulating on social media and accounts shared online. Security staff quickly moved in to identify those involved and remove them from the area.\n\nSome outlets and social media posts later claimed Doherty had been issued a lifetime ban from PGA Tour events. The tour has not publicly confirmed the scope or duration of any restriction.\n\nHughes later suggested the interruption had little lasting impact, saying security responded quickly and that while such moments are unwelcome, crowd behavior at the Phoenix Open has occasionally tested the boundaries of golf’s traditional etiquette.\n\nFootage circulating online also appeared to show a tournament official informing Doherty that he would not be permitted to attend PGA Tour events for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Waste Management Phoenix Open, staged annually at TPC Scottsdale and golf’s best-attended tournament by some distance, is widely considered one of the most raucous stops on the PGA Tour calendar. Much of that reputation is tied to the stadium-style 16th hole, where thousands of well-lubricated fans pack grandstands in an atmosphere closer to a football game than a traditional golf outing.\n\nThe event has long marketed itself as the sport’s most fan-friendly tournament, with music, hospitality zones and festival-style crowds spread across the course. Organizers have tightened fan-management measures in recent years after previous editions saw spikes in crowd-related incidents, including in 2024 when gates were temporarily closed and alcohol sales briefly halted because of overcrowding.\n\nThe episode underscores a broader challenge facing professional sports leagues as venues balance open fan access with an era in which spectators can instantly broadcast and monetize interactions from inside events. While fan filming has long been common, some leagues have begun reviewing policies around livestreaming, harassment and behavior designed specifically to generate viral content.\n\nThe shift has surfaced elsewhere in professional sport, including recent incidents at WNBA games in which sex toys were thrown onto the court, prompting league warnings and security reviews.\n\nIt remains unclear whether any tournament-specific or tour-wide restrictions beyond the reported ban have been formally issued, or whether Doherty could attempt to attend future events in another capacity, such as through hospitality or third-party access.\n\nThe PGA Tour and tournament organizers have not indicated whether any additional guidance or security measures will be introduced following the incident. The general manager for the Waste Management Phoenix Open did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.",

    "fullText": "Last year, Bloomington South junior Jaxsen Jean won a sectional wrestling title at 106 pounds while sophomore Nick Russell was king at 113, only for both to get beat in the regional finals. For Jean, it was a repeat of his freshman season.\n\nSo this year, they traded places and boom, both came out as champions at the Bloomington South Regional on Saturday, Feb. 7.\n\nJean has grown into a 113 body while Russell said he was 104 pounds last year competing at 113, so bulking up and cutting weight has been to his advantage at 106.\n\nMore: Bloomington South girls basketball repeats as sectional champs\n\n\"I think it has been,\" Russell said. \"It's definitely been a lot harder to get down to (106), but if I went (106) I'd have a better shot of getting to state and so far, it's working out.\"\n\nThey're drill partners, along with freshman Josiah Stanton, the 120 champ, and not surprisingly, they're having great seasons.\n\n\"We're helping each other a lot,\" Russell said. \"We go at it every day in the room. We hit drills hard. This week, I had Jaxsen pretend that he was Hunter (Pierson) and do the stuff that Hunter did.\n\n\"Some days, we go back and forth, but (Jean) usually gets the better of me. He works really well on his feet on defense. I get shots on him all the time, but I can't finish them.\"\n\n\"He shoots a lot,\" Jean added. \"At the beginning of the year, I struggled with a sprawl, and he started shooting on me a lot in practice and helped me get my sprawl better. I can help him with a lot of positions, he's not very good at and we just help each other.\"\n\nAll 11 Panthers who qualified for regional kept their seasons alive, including Brian Conley, who is making his senior year something special at 138 with back-to-back postseason titles.\n\nIn workman like fashion, he put together to solid wins of 7-3 and 7-0 before dominating William Rader of Terre Haute South, who was on a streak, having paced fourth last week but pinning a sectional champ in just 36 in his opener. Conley buried him, with a 17-2 tech fall.\n\nMore: Bloomington South girls basketball repeats as sectional champs\n\n\"The best I've done is third for both, so it's really awesome to get first this year,\" Conley said. \"I worked really hard in the off-season, so I'm really proud of myself.\"\n\nHe saw the end of the road coming and wanted to make sure he made the most of it after just making it to semistate last year.\n\n\"I'm not really cutting any weight this year, so that's a big help,\" Conley said. \"I have a lot of pride, as a senior now, a leader. So at practice, I'm able to work much harder and being a leader and role model. I've got that, a lot of confidence and a lot of pride in my team.\"\n\nOn the mat, his experience is taking over and hopes that will really help next week, too.\n\n\"I feel like my defense, I'm able to see when shots are coming and sprawl or move out of the way and figure out what I'm going to do next,\" Conley said. \"It's been a big gamechanger.\"\n\nConley was part of an outstanding day for the Panthers, one of six regional champs.\n\nRussell (106), Jean (113), Stanton (120), Amrin Pratt (144) and Wyatt Cooksey (157) all won titles, while Denny Allgood (175) and Mason Grubb (215) were second in rematches from their sectional finals. Taking third were Jude Pratt at 126, Mark Hand at 132 and at 150, surprising Gerardo Hernandez-Ibarra in his first year of varsity action.\n\nRussell (28-6) won by pin in 5:07, Jean (32-3) and Stanton (31-2) each by 17-1 tech fall, Amrin Pratt (31-3) by 5-0 decision and Cooksey (30-3) flattened three foes by pins of 30 seconds, 3:43 and 1:32.\n\nAllgood couldn't replicate his 13-4 major from sectional against 17th ranked Noah Fields of Terre Haute South, going down in sudden victory overtime, 5-2. Grubb closed the gap on Northview's Devyn Orman, but couldn't score in a 5-0 loss.\n\nSouth won the regional title with 199½ points to top Floyd Central (101½).\n\nAs the Patriots posed, it was the biggest picture of semi-state qualifiers ever for OV, with eight topping to old mark of seven.\n\n\"Taking eight to semi-state speaks volumes about your practice room,\" OV coach Steven Spicer said. \"Those guys are training with those guys every single day. I'm super proud of them.\"\n\nSeveral made it the hard way as Reid Lanman (30-10) at 144, Luke Burner (27-12) and Braddock Nickless (25-13) at 215 all knocked off a sectional champ in the first round to punch their tickets. Burner and Nickless were third and Lanman fourth.\n\n\"We try to trade film, game-plan but ultimately, it comes down to those guys having belief in themselves,\" Spicer said. \"We talk about it all week. The postseason mentality, how you should approach each match. Don't make it bigger than it is. Enjoy the moment. All that stuff.\n\n\"And they showed up. We thought we might have a chance. But it's just belief in what we do, belief in their training.\"\n\nOV also posted two of the most dramatic victories of the day, with Collin Willen (27-11) getting a literal last-second escape against sectional champ Miguel Tedrow in the semifinals at 165 for a 1-0 win. He would take second. Nickless won his third-place match in the same exact fashion, 10-9.\n\n\"Collin, his freshman year, he was varsity for us at 190,\" Spicer said. \"He wasn't 190, but we needed one. So he's wrestled everywhere from 157 to 190 for us. He's the ultimate teammate. To finally get over that hump as regional his senior year, he's peaking at the right time.\n\n\"That's the best he's wrestled all year, today.\"\n\nIn addition to Boltinghouse and Sloan, the Patriots also saw Riley Martin (30-8) take fourth at 157.\n\nNeither North or Edgewood could crack the championship column but will each have three carry on to semistate.\n\nEdgewood had two runner-ups. At 126, senior John Orman (19-2) is headed to semi-state for a fourth time, but couldn't solve No. 25 Nolan Mullins in an 8-2 loss. At 150, senior Cayleb Stephens (19-10) is a first-time semi-state qualifier but ran into No. 12 Hunter Banet of Floyd Central in the final, suffering an 11-0 major.\n\nMore: Edgewood wrestler Cayleb Stephens has heart and more this season\n\nJunior Lincoln Getts (20-6) ended the Mustangs' day on a high note at 285, coming up with a takedown midway through the first overtime period to take his third-place match after earning his first trip to semistate.\n\nNorth is sending Hopkins, who missed last year after making it as a sophomore and Ryan Watkins (26-10), third at 113. It will be Watkins' first trip to Evansville.\n\nTedrow (32-3), a senior, bounced back from his semi loss, taking his frustrations out in a 16-0 tech fall for third to also earn a return trip.\n\nTop team scores: Bloomington South 199½; Floyd Central 101½; Terre Haute South 91; Owen Valley 84; Jasper 77½; New Albany 43; Edgewood 42; Bloomington North 40; Southridge 31; Terre Haute North 29; Tell City 24½; Northview 22; Sullivan 8.\n\nTop 4 advance to state.

    "description": "\"The King\" continues his quest for the flyweight MMA throne on February 13.",
    "fullText": "Danny “The King” Kingad was once on the cusp of flyweight gold. Now, at ONE Fight Night 40: Buntan vs. Hemetsberger on Prime Video, the Filipino veteran looks to reignite his World Title pursuit on Friday, February 13, live in U.S. primetime from Bangkok’s iconic Lumpinee Stadium.\n\nThere, Kingad faces “Wolf Warrior” Hu Yong in a crucial three-round battle between two contenders desperate to rebound.\n\nSince joining ONE in 2016, Kingad has amassed 11 victories over some of the division’s biggest names, including a 2018 win over now-reigning ONE Flyweight MMA World Champion Yuya “Little Piranha” Wakamatsu.\n\nBut their rematch at ONE 165 didn’t go his way, with the Japanese superstar earning revenge via unanimous decision. Kingad then suffered a submission loss to former ONE Flyweight MMA World Champion Adriano “Mikinho” Moraes at ONE 169, marking back-to-back defeats for the first time in his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old’s bid for redemption was put on hold as injuries and the arrival of his second child kept him sidelined throughout 2025. Now Kingad returns, the time away only sharpening his hunger for victory.\n\nThe Lions Nation MMA representative told onefc.com:\n\n“Believe it or not, I really missed getting punched in the face. I miss the adrenaline, getting a black eye in a wild fight. I just want that euphoric feeling again. It’s those little things.\n\n“I’m feeling nothing but excitement. My last two fights didn’t go according to plan, so I’m hungry to redeem myself. I am pushing myself to the limits in training because I badly want to win this fight. Winning is the most important thing for me right now.”\n\nSnapping his skid won’t be easy. Hu owns ferocious knockout victories over former divisional king Geje “Gravity” Eustaquio and Eko Roni Saputra, with fight-ending power that makes him a constant threat.\n\nKingad respects the danger but has a clear path to neutralize the trigger-happy striker.\n\n“He is a proven finisher. He has taken out a lot of big names over the years. Then again, that’s the beauty of MMA. We’re not limited to one discipline. I know how good he is with his stand-up, so why not test his ground game?\n\n“His decision losses were mostly due to his opponents controlling him with top pressure on the ground. I think I can also beat him in that area and impose my will. My conditioning is also an advantage.”\n\nThis matchup also carries unfinished business. The pair were originally scheduled to meet at ONE Fight Night 15 in 2023, but a foot injury forced Kingad to withdraw.\n\n“The King” always knew they’d meet again. At this pivotal moment in his career, the timing couldn’t be better.\n\nThe proud Igorot warrior offered:\n\n“I’m relieved and excited that the match is finally happening. I got injured the last time, so this is a chance for me to display all the improvements I’ve made. I’ll give it my all.”\n\nDanny Kingad has never been in a boring fight. His relentless motor and bottomless gas tank allow him to grind opponents down, getting stronger as rounds tick by.\n\nHis wushu background bolsters his striking precision and fluidity, while his evolving ground game gives him options to change levels at will.\n\nWhile the 30-year-old understands he needs a statement finish to prove he’s still elite, he refused to make bold proclamations against a fighter of Hu Yong’s caliber. He’s simply prepared to do whatever it takes, even if it goes the distance.\n\n“I want a finish, of course, but realistically, I see this one going the full three rounds. We’re both tough to finish, so it’s a matter of who imposes his game plan.\n\n“I’m not afraid to strike with him, but if there are openings, I will go after those takedowns. It’s just a bonus for me if I get to submit him or finish him via ground-and-pound.”\n\nKingad understands the magnitude of this moment. The margin for error is razor-thin.\n\nNow a father of two, he carries extra motivation to perform and provide. A victory on February 13 also opens the opportunity for a US$50,000 performance bonus in his comeback fight.\n\nWith both fighters hungry to bounce back from recent losses, all the ingredients point to a memorable showdown.\n\n“I’m always motivated. Especially now, the stakes are higher. I just really want to win. It’s been a while. So I won’t force it, I believe that bonus will come at the right time.\n\n“Expect that this will be an explosive fight. We’re both coming off losses, and we’re both hungry. I’m very excited to do what I do best and get my career back on track.”",

    "description": "Ben McKevitt looks at the main stories from Sunderland’s trip to the Emirates — a mixture of good and bad!",
    "fullText": "As much as you could say that this was a continuation of some disappointing away form for the Lads, the performance was much improved in terms of intensity, ambition and composure.\n\nWhile the result was the same, this wasn’t a performance equal to those at Brentford and West Ham, wherein we slumped to lethargic and error-ridden defeats. Instead, this was the result of going away to the best team on the planet and going into battle with them on their own turf.\n\nThe scoreline reflects the overall truth that Arsenal were the better team but I’m still proud of the Lads and I think the team gave a good account of themselves across the park. These are the kinds of games that happen in the Premier League and to expect anything more than a tough, battling performance away at the Emirates would perhaps be a little unfair of the squad at this point.\n\nWe made some opportunities for ourselves, with Brian Brobbey’s early chance and Chemsdine Talbi’s effort being the most memorable. Elsewhere, Trai Hume played some excellent crosses and linked up play from his position on the right, and Habib Diarra found some driving pockets, but we couldn’t make anything land.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that some small mistakes were punished brutally yesterday – which we also experienced in the reverse fixture.\n\nAt home, slight lapses in concentration from Enzo Le Fée and Noah Sadiki led to pin-point lashes at goal from Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard. Here, the same could be said of Omar Alderete and Nordi Mukiel, which led to their opening two goals.\n\nIn reality, the finish still had to be perfect for their first and the passing had to be incisive for the second, and that’s what the elite teams are both capable of and known to do.\n\nNowhere was this more obvious than in the times we didn’t quite close them down quick enough on the edge of our own box, with Kai Havertz and Declan Rice both coming close and Martin Zubimendi slotting in a ridiculously accurate effort off the post.\n\nOn this point, I’d like to offer some nuance in that while we may have been slightly delayed in closing down shots, Arsenal obviously drill these scenarios meticulously so as to create space specifically for shots on the edge of the box. It’s particularly effective because they have the ability to punish so incisively in those situations.\n\nThey have quality all over the pitch — not least of all in goal where David Raya demonstrated once again why he’s one of the best in the business.\n\nWe didn’t test him too much outside of a drilled Talbi effort, but his handling of the ball, anticipation and distribution at speed was electric and shows why you have to be on form for the full ninety against the league leaders.\n\nIt was interesting to see how aggressively we were set up yesterday, with Sunderland going man-for-man all the way up the pitch out of possession.\n\nIt often forced Raya to go long, from where Dan Ballard and Alderete could often win the first contact and earn us possession again. Arsenal are clearly an excellent team and you could see they had manoeuvres planned to counter this, with Rice dropping into his own box to leave space for Raya to pick a pass, but we did often make them work to get out.\n\nAdditionally, Habib Diarra once again impressed both in and out of possession in his “Chris Rigg” role as the second striker in our pressing 4-4-2 from last season. We know Le Bris loves this setup and clearly recruited Diarra with that specific position in mind, but it’s great to see that he fits it so perfectly.\n\nThe bravery to go man-for-man allowed us to give a much better account of ourselves on the road and gave us a chance to get something from the game — it’s just unfortunate that we couldn’t fashion any more big chances but can see why Arsenal have such an incredible defensive record.\n\nWe went to the Emirates Stadium with an aggression that we hadn’t found ourselves capable of in recent away performances. This was great to see, and in my opinion, necessary if we were to stand a chance against the battling North Londoners.\n\nThey relish a battle down there and are known for their set piece expertise, so it was good to see that we didn’t succumb to either any goals from corners while causing them huge issues from our own set plays, with one in particular nearly leading to the opener if not from an important block from Havertz. Without Raya, I could’ve also seen a few more close calls for the home side as we caused chaos in their box.\n\nA primary pillar of our physical capabilities was Brian Brobbey, who was once again immense with his back to goal and, in my opinion, let down often and predictably by the officiating.\n\nI’m not too sure why he’s not allowed to win fouls but it makes it all the more impressive that he performed so impressively against the odds — both numerically against Arsenal’s two centre halves and the referee. It’s a shame that we couldn’t get more men around Brobbey in order to advance more efficiently up the pitch, but it’s something we’re clearly working towards and improving overall.\n\nThe substitutions made by Le Bris didn’t yield any immediate results but did make for some interesting viewing, and one particularly exciting sight was that of Nilsson Angulo’s introduction in Sunderland colours — especially as it saw him attacking from the right hand side.\n\nUpon his signing, all initial signals pointed to Angulo’s abilities being most refined off the left, driving on either side of the right full back and providing passes for teammates. Yesterday, though, we saw him replace Hume on the right side (even taking the set pieces that Hume had previously been entrusted with) while Romaine Mundle retained his position on the left, replacing Talbi.\n\nIt’s a sign that Le Bris may see Angulo as the right winger we’d clearly been interested in recruiting, especially in Bertrand Traoré‘s absence both in the immediate short term and potentially beyond. Something to keep an eye on.\n\nWe didn’t get to see much of Angulo’s quality during his fifteen-minute cameo, but it’s good to see that he’s fit and trusted from the off and I’m excited to see what he can bring.\n\nMundle’s introduction in the first instance was also notable. Le Bris clearly trusts him from the left wing and I think the fact that we’ve seen Simon Adingra go out of the door while Mundle is the first substitute away against Arsenal tells you a lot about what’s happening in training.\n\nA less exciting sight, however, was that of Noah Sadiki’s exit from the pitch, replaced by Lutsharel Geertruida. It came about five minutes after he clearly felt something of a tweak in his hamstring when stretching for a ball and which was undoubtedly the reason for the substitution.\n\nSadiki very rarely comes off the pitch so although it was concerning, it’s important to note that he did play for a further five minutes after the incident and walked off without much issue, so perhaps it was just a precautionary move from Le Bris.",

    "description": "It was another tough trip to London as the Lads were seen off by the Gunners. What did our writers make of it?",
    "fullText": "I don’t believe for one second that there wasn’t a single Sunderland player out there that wasn’t trying their hardest from the first minute.\n\nWhat we saw was our absolute best effort. And if that’s not good enough, well…it is what it is. Unlike against West Ham and Brentford, I think we really gave it our all but we came up against the best team walking the planet right now.\n\nNobody likes losing, but you have to be a big enough man to admit that we were just beaten by the better side, and that was the case here.\n\nArsenal are short odds to win the quadruple this season, and you can see why — they’re a relentless winning machine who can turn over even a very good side giving in their best effort, and we need to just take that as a fact and on the chin.\n\nI can bet that Gabriel and William Saliba haven’t faced anything as difficult as Brian Brobbey this season. I thought he was brilliant, and single-handedly gave them their biggest physical test of the campaign.\n\nWe got a taste of in the game at the Stadium of Light earlier in the season when Brobbey got in ahead of Gabriel for our equaliser, but yesterday they faced a fitter and stronger Brobbey, and I was really impressed with the way he played.\n\nHe’s getting better and better, and the only real criticism you could have is that he maybe could’ve done better with his chance early in the game, but that would be nit-picking. He was my pick for man of the match and I bet the Arsenal defenders will be glad they’re not playing against him again for a while.\n\nI don’t even think the three ‘mistakes’ that occurred leading to the Arsenal goals were particularly brutal, but against a team as good as Arsenal, you can’t even get away with the slightest of discrepancies.\n\nThat’s just a lesson we have to learn — you need to be perfect to get anything from a game away at the Emirates!\n\nYet another absolute clown officiated the game.\n\nSamuel Barrott was terrible, and really needs to look at the way he performed. Saliba should have been sent off for persistent fouling, he should have given a penalty after a foul from Martin Zubimendi on Dan Ballard, and Riccardo Calafiori got away with murder time after time, too.\n\nI’m getting sick of whingeing about the officials but it would be neglect if I didn’t continue to raise the issue of officials treating Brobbey and Ballard differently to other players simply because they’re physical and give as good as they get.\n\nOverall, I think we actually played quite well.\n\nThe scoreline flattered them really as I thought we stayed in the game for a good long while. We didn’t create many clear cut chances but we had more of the ball than expected and used it well at times. I got the impression that they were relieved to get the second goal and even after that, I think it was only the third goal that really killed us off.\n\nOf course, we still lost the game, but we’ve definitely played worse than that this season. Arsenal are one of the best teams in the world so there’s no shame in getting beat — especially if we actually put in a solid performance.\n\nHe made the right decision each time he got the ball and he was sharp and exciting to watch. He wasn’t on the pitch long but he gave a good first impression of himself and hopefully he can continue to integrate well with the squad and make an even bigger and better impact on the team for the remainder of the season.\n\nI was surprised to hear on the radio that our last away win was that terrific victory at Stamford Bridge in October. Since then, we’ve picked up some good points on the road against the likes of Tottenham, Liverpool and Brighton, but we haven’t been able to get all three.\n\nOur home form has been able to generate us a lot of points, meaning that poorer performances away from home haven’t left us struggling, but it would be great for our away form to improve soon.\n\nI thought the referee was really poor.\n\nBrian Brobbey and Dan Ballard hardly ever get anything from referees, but this was especially bad. Brobbey’s whole game plan is to pin and spin the defender but every time he did that, William Saliba almost had the shirt off his back and the referee gave nothing — and it’s the same with Ballard.\n\nEvery time he’s in the opposition box for a free kick or corner, there are multiple defenders surrounding him. They know how much of a threat he is and he always ends up getting dragged to the floor. If he got the treatment he gets in the box anywhere else on the pitch, it would definitely be given as a free kick.\n\nI’m aware that these interactions are hard to referee as Ballard and Brobbey are tussling with their opponent too, but it is getting more and more frustrating to see. It’s also become a recurring theme for referees to rule in favour of the “Big Six” teams and that was painfully obvious.\n\nThey’re clearly terrified of facing Mikel Arteta’s “wrath” — which is more like pathetic whinging.\n\nWe looked confident in possession and played some lovely football at times.\n\nPerhaps too much of this was deeper than the final third, but when we did progress forward, there were some intricate moves involving our creative players.\n\nAs a team, we’re growing in confidence and although we lost, we can take heart from how we took the game to Arsenal at times.\n\nIt’s been said that we don’t score enough goals, but it’s a work in progress and now we have Brian Brobbey up to full fitness and Habib Diarra back in the side, we have more of a physical and athletic threat going forward.\n\nThis is giving Enzo Le Fée and Chemsdine Talbi more options on the ball, and we’ll score plenty more goals between now and the end of the season.\n\nOmar Alderete has been superb this season but he did something I’ve been wary of for some time — made a few unforced errors.\n\nSometimes he’ll give the ball away cheaply or do something completely unexpected, such as kicking a misplaced long pass out of play.\n\nThankfully, the pros far outweigh the cons, but I’m sure he’ll be working hard to iron out those occasional flaws.\n\nWe have another big game coming up midweek and with very little room for rotation, our players will need to dust themselves down ready to go again in just a few days against Liverpool.\n\nFortunately they’ll be back at home with the red and white army in full voice to roar them on. There should be no pressure on the Lads against he current champions and I hope they have enough in the tank for another big game.\n\nThe West Ham game was pretty poor but while this was a similar score it wasn’t a similar performance at all. The Lads gave it a good go and if the early chance for Brian Brobbey had gone in, it could’ve been a very interesting game.\n\nIt was a good battle but we lost to a better team and that’s OK.\n\nWe have to remember we came up via the playoffs and we just competed better than many sides at the home of the champions-in-waiting. That can’t be written off as anything less than good progress.\n\nThe first goal needed a perfect shot masked by defenders and in off the inside of the post to give them the lead, and that was the theme of the game.\n\nThroughout the game, they had to come up with real quality to get past us and that’s a compliment to our lads.\n\nTime and again, the commentators said that wasn’t a 3-0-type loss, and the boys can take a lot from that.\n\nThe potential injury to Sadiki is a worry as the man is a total football athlete.\n\nHopefully it was precautionary and he can be back very soon.\n\nThe first goal came about due to us not closing players down, and we need to learn from this.\n\nWe may be able to trust Robin Roefs against many sides from range but at home (with the Leandro Trossard goal) and away, we gave top quality players too much space.\n\nA lesson to learn, and we will.",

    "title": "Sunderland Women’s Rising Stars: The Academy’s Bright Future",
    "description": "Sunderland has always been a hotbed of talent, and it remains so today.",
    "fullText": "There is something unmistakably Sunderland about the emergence of young footballers who carry both the weight of expectation and the ease of belonging. It is a club whose identity has always been rooted in development, in giving opportunities to those who have grown through its system, and in trusting youth not as a gamble but as a philosophy.\n\nThe women’s team, perhaps more than any other part of the club, embodies this tradition. The conveyor belt of talent that has passed through Wearside is extraordinary by any measure: England internationals, WSL champions, Lionesses legends, and players who have shaped the modern game all trace their beginnings back to Sunderland’s academy.\n\nIn the present moment, that lineage feels as alive as ever. The senior squad is increasingly dotted with teenagers and early-twenty-somethings who are not merely filling shirts but pushing for genuine involvement. Even when they are not yet regular starters, their presence on the bench is becoming more frequent, more natural, and more indicative of what is to come. It feels inevitable that these young players will soon transition from occasional substitutes to prominent features in the matchday squad, and eventually to the spine of the team.\n\nAmong the most notable names in this emerging cohort are goalkeeper Jenny Blench, defenders Chloe Paxton and Ella West, midfielder Emily Cassap and forward Niyah Dunbar, who is currently out on loan at Middlesbrough. Alongside them, one 20-year-old, Katy Watson, and two 21-year-olds, Libbi McInnes and Reanna Blades, deserve recognition for their contributions and potential, even if circumstances have limited their minutes. Together, they represent not just individual promise but the strength of a system that continues to produce footballers capable of shaping the club’s future.\n\nTo understand why their rise feels so natural, we must first appreciate the environment that has shaped them.\n\nSunderland’s academy is not merely productive; it is a hotbed of talent, a place where footballing identity is forged early and where young players are taught not only technical skill but resilience, intelligence, and a deep understanding of the game. It is an academy that has historically punched far above its financial weight, producing players who have gone on to dominate the highest levels of women’s football. That legacy is not a relic of the past; it is a living, breathing force that continues to influence the club’s trajectory.\n\nThe current generation is the latest expression of that tradition, and their stories illuminate why Sunderland’s future looks so bright.\n\nJenny Blench, the young goalkeeper increasingly seen among the substitutes, is a compelling example of what the academy does so well. Goalkeeping is a position that demands maturity, presence, and confidence — qualities that often take years to develop. Yet Blench already carries herself with a composure that belies her age. Her shot-stopping ability is sharp, instinctive, and brave, the kind of reflexive talent that cannot be taught but can certainly be nurtured. What stands out most, however, is her command of the box. Even in academy and development fixtures, she has shown a willingness to take responsibility, to claim crosses, and to organise the defensive line in front of her. These are traits that coaches value immensely, because they indicate not just technical ability but leadership potential.\n\nHer distribution, too, reflects the modern demands of the position. Sunderland’s style increasingly relies on goalkeepers who can initiate play, who can break lines with passes, and who can remain calm under pressure. Blench fits that mould. While she is still developing the consistency that comes with experience, the raw materials are unmistakable. Her presence on the bench is not symbolic; it is a sign that the coaching staff trust her, believe in her, and see her as part of the club’s long-term plan. It feels only a matter of time before she begins to accumulate more minutes, whether through cup opportunities, late-game appearances, or rotation during congested periods of the season.\n\nIn front of her, defenders Chloe Paxton and Ella West represent two different but equally exciting profiles of young talent. Paxton is a defender who plays with a maturity that suggests she has been absorbing the game for far longer than her age would imply. Her reading of play is exceptional, allowing her to anticipate danger before it fully materialises. She is the kind of defender who makes interceptions look effortless, not because the opposition are poor but because she positions herself so intelligently. Her tackling is clean, well-timed, and confident, and she has a natural ability to stay composed even when under pressure.\n\nWhat makes Paxton particularly valuable is her versatility. She is comfortable operating across the defensive line, adapting to the needs of the team and the demands of the match. This adaptability is a hallmark of Sunderland’s academy graduates, who are often trained to understand multiple roles and responsibilities. Paxton’s ability to step into different positions without losing her effectiveness makes her a manager’s dream, especially in a league where squad depth can be tested by injuries, fixture congestion, and tactical shifts.\n\nElla West, meanwhile, brings a different energy to the defensive unit. She is dynamic, athletic, and fearless, with a willingness to engage physically and a determination that stands out even in a competitive environment. West’s defensive style is proactive; she does not wait for the game to come to her but instead seeks to influence it. Her pace allows her to recover quickly, to track runners, and to support the attack when needed. She is also strong in one-on-one situations, using both her physicality and her timing to win duels.\n\nWhat sets West apart is her confidence on the ball. She is not content simply to clear danger; she wants to build play, to carry the ball forward, and to contribute to the team’s progression. This aligns perfectly with Sunderland’s evolving tactical identity, which increasingly values defenders who can initiate attacks rather than merely prevent them. West’s development trajectory suggests that she will become a key figure in this system, offering both defensive solidity and attacking impetus.\n\nIn midfield, Emily Cassap represents one of the most intriguing prospects in the squad. Midfield is often the most demanding area of the pitch for young players, requiring not only technical skill but tactical intelligence, physical endurance, and the ability to read the rhythm of the game. Cassap possesses all of these qualities in abundance. Her passing range is impressive, allowing her to dictate play from deep or to operate in more advanced areas. She has a natural sense of when to speed up the game and when to slow it down, a skill that often takes years to refine.\n\nCassap’s work rate is exceptional. She covers ground tirelessly, pressing opponents, recovering possession, and supporting both defensive and attacking phases. Her ability to transition quickly, from defence to attack and vice versa, makes her invaluable in a league where momentum can shift rapidly. She also has a creative spark, capable of threading passes through tight spaces and unlocking defences with moments of vision.\n\nWhat makes Cassap particularly exciting is her ceiling. She is already a technically gifted midfielder, but her potential for growth is enormous. With more minutes, more exposure to senior football, and more opportunities to test herself against experienced opponents, she could develop into one of the most influential players in the squad. Her presence on the bench is not simply a nod to her promise; it is a recognition that she is ready to contribute now, even if her role is still evolving.\n\nNiyah Dunbar’s progression through Sunderland’s pathway has been a quietly impressive example of how well the club develops its young talent. Having come through the academy, she made the step into first-team football with a confidence that immediately caught the eye. Even in limited minutes, she showed she could handle the physicality of senior competition, and her attitude earned her trust within the squad. The loan move to Middlesbrough has been the natural next step, giving her the chance to play every week and refine her game in a competitive environment.\n\nUp front, Dunbar offers a blend of energy, direct running and intelligent movement. She presses with real intent, unsettling defenders and setting the tone from the front. Her ability to drive at back lines, hold the ball under pressure and link play makes her a versatile option, while her instinct for finding pockets of space hints at a forward with significant long-term potential.\n\nAlongside these five, the honourable mentions of Katy Watson, Libbi McInnes and Reanna Blades highlight the depth of talent emerging from Sunderland’s system.\n\nKaty Watson’s emergence at Sunderland has been one of the most compelling stories in the women’s game over the past couple of seasons. A product of the club’s academy, she has moved through the pathway with a quiet determination that reflects both her character and the environment that shaped her. Initially introduced in short bursts from the bench, she quickly showed she could handle the physical and tactical demands of senior football, and her consistency has since made her a regular feature in the starting XI.\n\nWhat sets Watson apart on the wing is her blend of directness and intelligence. She carries the ball with real purpose, driving at full-backs and forcing defenders into uncomfortable decisions. Her movement is sharp and instinctive, often drifting inside to link play or stretching the pitch to create space for others. There’s a maturity to her decision-making that belies her age, and her work rate out of possession makes her invaluable in Sunderland’s pressing structure. As she continues to develop, she looks every bit like a player capable of shaping the club’s future.\n\nMcInnes, at 21, has already shown glimpses of what she can offer. Her technical ability is clear, and she has demonstrated composure in possession and intelligence in her movement. The challenge for her has been consistency of minutes, something that can be difficult to achieve in a competitive squad. Yet even without regular starts, she has made an impression. Her involvement in matchday squads signals that the coaching staff see her as part of the club’s future, and with continued development, she could become a more prominent figure.\n\nReanna Blades, also 21, has faced a different challenge: injury. Returning from injury is never easy, especially for young players who are still establishing themselves. Yet Blades has shown resilience, determination, and a willingness to work her way back into contention. Her previous performances demonstrated her potential, and there is every reason to believe that once she regains full fitness, she will reassert herself as a valuable option for the team. Her pace, energy, and attacking instincts make her a threat, and her ability to influence games from wide areas or more central positions adds tactical flexibility.\n\nTogether, these seven players illustrate the strength of Sunderland’s youth development. They are not isolated cases but part of a broader pattern that has defined the club for years. Sunderland’s academy is not simply good; it is exceptional. It has produced players who have gone on to represent England, to win major trophies, and to shape the landscape of women’s football. That legacy continues to inspire the next generation, who grow up knowing that the pathway to the top is not only possible but proven.\n\nThe club’s commitment to youth is not merely philosophical; it is practical. Sunderland has long understood that investing in young players is both sustainable and strategically advantageous. It creates a culture of loyalty, identity, and continuity. It fosters a sense of belonging among players who have grown through the system. And it ensures that the squad remains dynamic, adaptable, and forward-looking.\n\nThe current moment feels like a turning point. The increasing presence of young players on the bench is not a coincidence but a deliberate strategy. It reflects the coaching staff’s belief in their readiness, their potential, and their ability to contribute meaningfully. It also reflects the club’s long-term vision, which prioritises development, progression, and the integration of academy talent into the senior squad.\n\nThere is a sense of inevitability about what comes next. These players will not remain peripheral figures for long. Their involvement will grow, their minutes will increase, and their influence will expand. They will become part of the team’s core, shaping its identity and driving its success. The process may be gradual, but it is already underway.\n\nThe future of Sunderland Women looks bright not because of external investment or short-term recruitment but because of the strength of its foundations. The academy continues to produce players who are technically gifted, tactically intelligent, and emotionally resilient. It continues to attract and develop talent that fits the club’s ethos. And it continues to serve as a beacon of excellence in women’s football.\n\nAs the women’s game grows, the importance of strong development pathways becomes even more pronounced. Clubs that invest in youth, that nurture talent, and that create opportunities will be the ones that thrive. Sunderland is already ahead of the curve in this regard. Its track record speaks for itself, and its current generation of young players is poised to carry that legacy forward.\n\nThe rise of Blench, Paxton, West, Cassap, Dunbar, McInnes and Watson is not just a story of individual potential but a testament to the club’s enduring commitment to development. It is a reminder that Sunderland’s identity is built on more than results; it is built on people, on pathways, and on the belief that talent should be given the chance to flourish.\n\nIn the coming seasons, these young players will step onto the pitch not as prospects but as key contributors. They will shape matches, influence outcomes, and become part of the club’s narrative. Their emergence will not only strengthen the squad but also inspire the next generation of academy players who dream of following in their footsteps.\n\nSunderland’s future is being written now, in training sessions, in development fixtures, and on the benches of matchday squads. It is being written by young players who are ready to seize their moment, by coaches who believe in them, and by a club that understands the value of nurturing its own.\n\nThe inevitability of their rise is not a matter of hope but of history. Sunderland has always been a hotbed of talent, and it remains so today. The next chapter promises to be just as exciting as those that came before, driven by a new generation of players who are ready to make their mark.",

    "fullText": "Minnesota Vikings-themed rumors lit up like a Christmas tree after the organization fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah last week. The rumor mill never goes silent, but it’s amplified at the moment.\n\nThe latest Minnesota buzz ties Jefferson to trade chatter, frames Murray’s likely price tag, and flags a veteran free agent as a plausible fit.\n\nHere’s a look at the latest on the day of Super Bowl LX\n\nTrades and free agency dominate the Sunday, February 8th edition.\n\nRumor: The Buffalo Bills appear to be a trade suitor for Justin Jefferson.\n\nSI.com’s Alex Brasky kicked off the Jefferson trade speculation last week, noting, “It’s startling to consider what Jefferson could do with a quarterback like the Bills’ Josh Allen, the league’s reigning MVP. If you look at the Bills’ WR corps since the team traded former No. 1 Stefon Diggs after the 2023 season, the team’s leader has been Khalil Shakir, whose high watermark has been 821 yards, set in 2024.”\n\n“Allen has been desperately craving a top-tier pass catcher on the outside, and Jefferson would fulfill that role as one of the most dynamic WRs in all of football. If the Bills were to go out and acquire Jefferson, it would require quite the commitment in terms of trade pieces. Buffalo would likely have to offer up at least one first-round pick, along with several other picks, to sweeten the deal.” The price tag alone pushes the idea into the realm of front-office fantasy.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped the chatter from accelerating. Jefferson’s recent praise of Brady on a podcast poured fuel on the fire, sending Jefferson-to-Buffalo theories ricocheting around the internet.\n\n“For example, when the Kansas City Chiefs traded WR Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins in March of 2022, the Dolphins were forced to part with a first, second and fourth-round selection in that upcoming draft, along with a fourth and sixth-rounder the following year,” Brasky continued.\n\n“There is also the Bills’ salary-cap situation to consider, as Buffalo is hard up against the cap as it stands in early February. According to Spotrac, the Bills are around $10 million over the league’s figure of about $301.2M to $305.7M.”\n\nJefferson said about Brady this week: “I feel like he was mostly the reason why I got picked first round. He’s the reason why my hands got better, why a lot of things occurred during that season, so I’m just proud of him to go from the (New Orleans) Saints to LSU, and now he’s back in the league and about to be a head coach.”\n\nThe only problem? Jefferson isn’t for sale. This is just Bills-themed daydreaming.\n\nRumor: Kyler Murray can get-got for a 2nd or 3rd-Round pick.\n\nA 2nd-Round pick could be enough to pry Murray loose via trade. Bleacher Report‘s Alex Kay scribed this week, “Projected Trade Value: 2026 2nd-Round Pick. A few quarterbacks may find themselves on the trade market, including Arizona Cardinals signal-caller Kyler Murray. The 28-year-old has never delivered any postseason success, and Arizona’s offense actually operated more efficiently with him out of the lineup this past season.”\n\n“The Cardinals will be rebuilding with a new head coach in 2026, so it may be the right time to move in a new direction at quarterback. Of course, his 2026 cap hit of $53.3 million could make it difficult for Arizona to maximize Murray’s trade value. However, the Cardinals may catch a break by having Moore return to college in 2026.”\n\nMurray’s name has hovered around the Vikings’ rumor mill since he was perceived as “softly benched” by the Cardinals earlier this season, keeping Minnesota loosely tied to any league-wide quarterback movement.\n\nKay added, “Another source believes that the starting price point for Murray will be a second-round pick, per Weinfuss, and that if the Cardinals can move the two-time Pro Bowler, they will. The Jets might be the one team desperate enough to expend draft and cap capital to take a flier on Murray.”\n\n“They were widely expected to take Moore at No. 2 overall — the Las Vegas Raiders will presumably snap up Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza at No. 1—before he announced he wouldn’t enter the draft. With no other QB prospect worthy of the second pick, New York may look to resurrect Murray’s career instead.”\n\nIf the price is this affordable, Minnesota should pounce. Murray is the fifth-most accurate passer in NFL history. He would cook with the Vikings.\n\nRumor: Kirk Cousins is the Vikings’ top free-agent target.\n\nWant a hot-shot cornerback? How about a safety? Nope, says CBS Sports. Jared Dubin claims Kirk Cousins, if released by the Atlanta Falcons, is the wisest Vikings free-agent target out there.\n\nHe explained: “With the J.J. McCarthy experiment seemingly going off the rails, the Vikings need to bring in a veteran quarterback to compete with him and/or be the backup and fill-in starter in case things don’t go well again.”\n\n“Cousins is likely set to hit free agency given his contractual situation, and we know he is familiar with both the Vikings and Kevin O’Connell’s system, making this an easy, comfortable fit.”\n\nCousins would check some boxes as a smart McCarthy insurance policy and will finally be cheap, but many Vikings fans would groan at the mere mention of his name. He’s a divisive dude.",

    "fullText": "Golden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy was always going to face tough questions after what turned out to be an underwhelming trade deadline for Dub Nation. Many expected a blockbuster move for Giannis Antetokounmpo, but instead, the Warriors landed Kristaps Porzingis. Does that make them true contenders? Maybe not anymore, but that does not mean Dunleavy lacks confidence in his current group.\n\nThe season took a sharp turn for the worse when Jimmy Butler suffered a torn ACL that will sideline him for a year. That leaves Stephen Curry carrying an even heavier load to keep the Warriorscompetitive. The future Hall of Famer now finds himself more isolated than ever, especially with Draymond Green no longer performing at anything close to his prime level.\n\nSo, it was rumored that both Butler and Green were on the trade block in the Warriors’ attempt to get Giannis. When asked about the same in a recent interview, however, Dunleavy vehemently denied the same.\n\nThe reporters in attendance were trying to find out who exactly it was that the Warriors were okay with parting ways with, and Dunleavy got mad. Things got especially heated when someone, rather casually, declared that Draymond would have had to be a part of the deal to get Giannis to San Francisco.\n\n“No he wouldn’t,” Dunleavy responded. “You’re putting words in my mouth. So, that’s an unbelievable assumption.”\n\nIn most cases, reporters would take that as a cue to change the subject. But that person kept pressing on, asking the Warriors GM if it was Butler on the block instead. Unsurprisingly, it irked Dunleavy even more.\n\n“No, no. We’re not doing that. I’m not going down the roster talking about who’s in trades, who’s not. We don’t do that,” he declared, bringing the conversation to an end.\n\nWhat did raise eyebrows, however, was Draymond’s whole take on the matter. Of course, being a 14-year veteran and a franchise legend, he was talking to the front office about a potential Giannis deal. And according to his words on his podcast, Dunleavy told him that either Butler or he would have to be in a deal if the Greek were to come to the Bay.\n\nWhether Dunleavy would go ahead with that if the Bucks agreed will remain a mystery. Perhaps they’ll go after him again the summer. For now, Green stays put.\n\nThe post “Putting Words In My Mouth”: Warriors GM Gets Heated When Asked About Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green Trade Rumors appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Mario Bautista calls for a rematch against Cory Sandhagen following his win at Saturday's UFC Fight Night 266.",
    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS – Mario Bautista thinks the time is right to revisit the fight that gave him his first career defeat.\n\nAfter picking up a win at UFC Fight Night 266, Bautista (17-3 MMA, 11-3 UFC) called for a rematch against former UFC bantamweight title challenger Cory Sandhagen. Bautista, who submitted Vinicius Oliveira (23-4 MMA, 4-1 UFC) in the main event of Saturday's card at the Meta APEX in Las Vegas, thinks he's evolved enough to change the outcome of a fight between the two. In their first fight in 2019, Bautista lost to Sandhagen by first-round armbar.\n\n\"I think it goes completely different,\" Bautista told MMA Junkie and other reporters at the UFC Fight Night 266 post-fight press conference. \"I've had so much more experience. That was, I can't even (remember), maybe 10-12 fights ago? I've had a lot of experience in that time, and he's just kind of hanging out in that spot. He just can't break that championship spot. I think it would make for a great fight, so give me that opportunity to see where I can go.\"\n\nBautista's win over Oliveira got him back on track. He was coming off a unanimous decision loss to Umar Nurmagomedov in October, a defeat that snapped an impressive eight-fight unbeaten streak. Back in the win column, Bautista thinks a win over Sandhagen would get him that much-desired shot at the UFC bantamweight belt now held by Petr Yan.\n\n\"Definitely off Sandhagen, that calls for a shot at the title,\" Bautista said. \"I think I have a great style to beat the champ, and I'd give him a run for his money. I feel like I have to get past Sandhagen first. I lost my (UFC) debut to him, and it would just feel (wrong) if I passed him on that, so I want to get that one back.\"\n\nBautista has fought twice in less than four months. Ideally, he'd like to take a little time off and come back to fight Sandhagen after a longer break.\n\n\"Summertime would be nice,\" Bautista said. \"I just had two fights back-to-back, and this was a five-round camp, so it would be nice to catch up on some life in between this.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Mario Bautista calls for rematch vs. Cory Sandhagen",

    "fullText": "The Lakers are using their final roster spot in-house with reports of signing 22-year-old two-way guard Kobe Bufkin to a two-year standard NBA contract with a team option in 2026-27, according to ESPN's Shams Charania.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are signing guard Kobe Bufkin to a two-year deal, with a team option for the 2026-27 season, sources tell ESPN. Bufkin has starred for L.A.'s South Bay affiliate and now rejoins the Lakers in his third NBA season to fill their 15th roster spot. pic.twitter.com/Z1m3M4KvTM\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 8, 2026\n\nThe Michigan native has made a name for himself this season with impressive performances for the Lakers' South Bay G-League team. In 26 games for South Bay, Bufkin has averaged 26.7 points on 43% shooting from 3 and 51.3% overall.\n\nThis signing comes after Bufkin posted a career-high 41 points on Wednesday in South Bay's win over Capital City Go-Go, having 30 of those points in the first half after starting the game seven for seven from 3. In the previous game, he started six for six from deep.\n\nBufkin gives the Lakers another 3-point weapon off the bench for coach JJ Redick, as the team now has two new additions to the roster after trading for sharpshooting guard Luke Kennard — for Gabe Vincent and a 2032 second-round pick — on the last day of the trade deadline.\n\nBufkin has appeared in four games this season for the Lakers after signing a 10-day contract with the team on Jan. 13. In those games he averaged 3.0 points in 11.3 minutes.",

    "fullText": "Dillon Brooks calls out Joel Embiid's 'flopping' after Suns' loss to the 76ers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns suffered a 109-103 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. It was a cagey affair, as Dillon Brooks led the way for the Suns with a 28-point performance. On the other end, the 76ers relied on their two superstars, Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, who combined for 62 points.\n\nEmbiid was dominant across the board with his 33 points, and he made a living from the charity stripe, as he was 11-for-13 from the line. This caught Brooks' ire, who took it upon himself to guard Embiid late in the game, but it was too little, too late.\n\nDespite his injuries, Embiid has maintained his status as one of the most unstoppable offensive players in the league. He is a physical behemoth who can dominate every game with his post presence and mid-range game. This has led to his matchups fouling him to prevent him from scoring.\n\nUnfortunately for most of his opponents, Embiid is a reliable free-throw shooter. That has led some fans and even players to resent how Embiid plays. On Saturday, it was Brooks who made veiled shots against the former MVP.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks calls out Draymond Green and Paul George for podcasts while still in the NBA\n\nBrooks was unhappy with how it turned out, especially since the Suns lost. Devin Booker returned from an ankle sprain and had a 21-point night, but it wasn't enough to help them win against the 76ers' overwhelming offense.\n\n\"Maybe start that earlier. I can guard the flooping and all that. 14 times. That's a lot, especially for stuff that are not even shooting fouls. It's a great group of refs that were reffing the game for Philly tonight,\" Brooks said about Embiid's game and how it was officiated.\n\nThe Suns are having a fantastic season, as they have beaten plenty of expectations. They have lost two consecutive games, which is not a good look. However, they can bounce back in the long run, especially with Booker's return.\n\nThey must get over this loss, but it can be tough after Brooks' comments. In the long run, this should not be the biggest loss on their record, but it could motivate them to be much better on defense.\n\nDraymond Green takes another swipe at Dillion Brooks\n\nDillon Brooks credits his Phoenix Suns teammates for helping him win Player of the Week\n\nCollin Gillespie joins Suns' all-time greats with monster game vs. Trail Blazers\n\nSuns trade for Cole Anthony, duck under luxury tax\n\nDillon Brooks receives support from teammate for All-Star push after recent performances",

    "description": "Before ONE Fight Night 40 this Friday, \"Vanilla Thunder\" explains how The Used became the soundtrack to his life.",
    "fullText": "Canadian heavyweight MMA fighter Ben Tynan may enjoy riding his dirt bike and exploring America’s backcountry, but there’s no doubt that everywhere he goes, he brings a little bit of a punk rock vibe to the party.\n\nA simple glance at “Vanilla Thunder” reveals that – he wears band T-shirts, has plugs in his ears, and bleaches his hair a shade of blonde that would make even Billie Joe Armstrong turn green with envy.\n\nTynan will bring that swagger into his showdown with Japanese knockout artist Ryugo Takeuchi at ONE Fight Night 40 on Friday, February 13, where he expects to deliver a signature performance. And, to steal a line from his favorite song by The Used, he’ll “savor every moment of this.”\n\nTynan’s fascination with The Used began when he was a young child living in Seattle, Washington.\n\nIn September 2002, the Utah-based post-hardcore collective dropped their first song “The Taste Of Ink,” a deceptively melodic track wrapped in raw emotion and featuring frontman Bert McCracken’s anguished vocals about his dissatisfaction with his place in life and burning desire to chase his dreams.\n\n“The Taste Of Ink” would serve as the leadoff single to their self-titled debut album, and a young Tynan would borrow his brother’s copy and play that specific record on repeat.\n\n“‘The Taste Of Ink’ is, like, the classic. That was the first one I heard as a kid. It was on my brother’s CD, and I remember going, ‘Ohh, this is cool.’ And what made it worse is I was so excited about it. I kept listening and listening to it.”\n\nEventually, Tynan listened to the rest of the songs on the self-titled LP and fell even \n\nThe four-piece became the soundtrack to his adolescence, as “Vanilla Thunder” obsessively consumed their follow-up albums – including 2004’s platinum-selling sophomore set In Love And Death, 2007’s Lies For The Liars, and 2009’s Artwork.\n\n“I went through a huge phase. I actually really liked their album Artwork. That came out when I was in high school, and it doesn’t get a lot of credit. But man, something about those songs, they hit so hard. Album-wise, I love Artwork. In Love And Death is an awesome album too.”\n\nIn November 2009, The Used was on tour in support of Artwork, and Tynan – then a sopho\n\nThere was a tour stop at Showbox SoDo, a converted-warehouse-turned-concert venue in Seattle, and the Canadian wrestling machine was able to secure a ticket and make the trek from his new home base in Eastern Washington.\n\n“That was my first big concert. I went to little shows before when I was younger, but I remember I was living in Eastern Washington at the time, and my sister was back living in Seattle. I had a buddy, and we road-tripped there. We had to skip school to make that concert, so we skipped a day of school and then went to Seattle and saw them. It was sick.”\n\nShowbox SoDo is a standing-room venue with a maximum capacity of 1,800 people, making the environment seem intimate, yet feel big enough for moshing around.\n\nAs soon as The Used went on stage and played the opening riffs of Artwork‘s lead single “Blood On My Hands,” the crowd went berserk. Tynan and his friend were in their element. They found their people, their favorite band was playing, and they were savoring the entire atmosphere.\n\n“It was packed, and I remember being a little dude getting all jacked up. There was a mosh pit, I went in it, and I got tossed around because I was a little pipsqueak back then. But, you know, it was good vibes. Everyone had good energy. It was really cool.”",

    "fullText": "After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.\n\nMany stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.\n\nMillions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.\n\nAnd many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US president Donald Trump will not be one of them.\n\nThe Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.\n\nThe Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.\n\nLed by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.\n\nThis is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has helped turn the Seahawks into narrow favourites, thanks also to a fearsome defence led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nMany of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.\n\nPuerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.\n\nHe will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years. He is also an actor, has hosted Saturday Night Live and been a WWE 24/7 champion.\n\nRock band Green Day, who are from California, will play an anniversary ceremony before Sunday's game and the NFL has teased that there will be some surprises at half-time.\n\nBad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of President Trump, and Bad Bunny's selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles.\n\nThe controversy even led conservative group Turning Point USA to plan an alternative half-time show, which will star singer and Trump ally Kid Rock.\n\nBad Bunny says he's losing sleep over the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend America's biggest game last year but he said this year's on the west coast is \"just too far away\".\n\nAsked about the selection of Bad Bunny and Green Day, Trump added: \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he avoided the US on his current world tour because of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nThere were fears there would be raids around the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, plus further protests after two people were shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\nBut, speaking on Tuesday, the NFL's chief security officer Cathy Lanier said that no ICE operations are scheduled around any of the many Super Bowl events.\n\nShe added that the Department of Homeland Security sends a variety of different agencies to the Super Bowl, which it ranks as a tier-one event, and ICE is not one of them.\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough Sunday's game will take place at the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium is 45 miles south of the Golden Gate Bridge in Santa Clara.\n\nWhile San Francisco has been the main hub during Super Bowl week, events and parties have been spread around the Bay Area, beginning with Opening Night in San Jose on Monday.\n\nActor Jon Hamm hosted the NFL's end-of-season awards night on Thursday, which was attended by Steve Irwin's son Robert, who earlier in the day took a snake into the media centre to help promote the first NFL game in Melbourne later this year.\n\nShaquille O'Neal hosted a party on Friday while Post Malone held a free concert, with artists as diverse as Olivia Dean, Shaboozey, Sting, Calvin Harris, Zach Bryan and Teddy Swims playing at other events.\n\nCardi B also performed on Saturday before watching her partner Stefon Diggs play for the Patriots on Sunday, when Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones are also among the gameday performers.\n\nOther visitors include Roger Federer, Jay Z, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and Paris St-Germain owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\n\nWahlberg's fellow New England fan Jon Bon Jovi will introduce the Patriots players on Sunday, with actor Chris Pratt, a Seattle supporter, doing the honours for the Seahawks.\n\nThe cheapest resale ticket available on Thursday cost $4,388 (£3,222)\n\nLast year's Super Bowl was watched by a TV audience of 127.7 million people in the US\n\nLast year's half-time performance by Kendrick Lamar averaged 133.5 million - making it the most-watched half-time show on record\n\nTV commercials have sold for an average of about $8m (£5.9m) for a 30-second slot, with a handful costing a record $10m\n\nAmericans will bet a record $1.76bn (£1.29bn) on Super Bowl 59, estimates the American Gaming Association\n\nThe National Chicken Council predicts that 1.48bn chicken wings will be eaten during the game\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is expected to generate more than $500m (£367m) for the local economy, with more than 90,000 visitors from outside the San Francisco Bay Area\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will kick-off on Sunday at 23:30 GMT and be broadcast live on Channel 5, Sky Sports and DAZN.\n\nYou can listen to live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds and follow live text coverage via the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNBC will be the host broadcasters this year in the US.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nSeahawks or Patriots?

It’s a shame that they conceded and allowed Wolves to get more and more into it in the second half, but Chelsea could have been even more goals up after that superb first half performance.\n\nAs you can see above, Bruno Fernandes posted on Palmer’s post on Instagram, showing his appreciation for the Chelsea star.\n\nQuality recognises quality it seems, and what a recognition for Palmer to get from one of the best and most consistently good midfielders in the league.\n\nLiam Rosenior has won 7 of his 9 Games in charge of Chelsea.\n\n15/15 Points in the Premier League.\n\nOnly two defeats have come against Arsenal, arguably the best team in Europe. (By 1 Goal each time).\n\nThis is a superb start for the Blues boss and long may it continue.",

    "fullText": "The Amex Stadium prepares for a high-stakes edition of the M23 derby this Sunday afternoon as Brighton and Crystal Palace look to banish recent struggles and claim local bragging rights.\n\nBoth clubs enter the second derby of the campaign in search of a much-needed “reset”. Fabian Hürzeler’s Seagulls have become the division’s draw specialists. Their 10 stalemates represent the highest tally in the Premier League this season. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace are currently enduring a dismal nine-match winless run. This form leaves Oliver Glasner’s side in 15th place and glancing nervously at the relegation zone. Only two points separate the rivals in the table.\n\nVenue: American Express Stadium, Brighton\n\nLast Meeting: Crystal Palace 0–0 Brighton (9 Nov 2025), Premier League\n\nFabian Hürzeler confirmed that midfielder Diego Gomez is back and available for selection. However, Yasin Ayari will miss out with a shoulder injury sustained last weekend. Mats Wieffer remains sidelined with a toe problem but is nearing a return. The Seagulls continue to be without long-term absentees Solly March, Adam Webster, and Stefanos Tzimas. Joel Veltman is expected to start at right-back over Ferdi Kadıoğlu.\n\nThe Eagles welcome back Adam Wharton after he served a one-match suspension. However, Eddie Nketiah is set to miss out with an injury. Cheick Doucouré (knee), Justin Devenny (ankle), and Daichi Kamada (muscle) are also unavailable. Ismaïla Sarr is expected to start in attack. Sarr has scored nine goals in all competitions this season.\n\nThe Seagulls have proved difficult to beat at home recently. Notably, Brighton have lost just two of their last 20 league games at the Amex. Only Liverpool and Arsenal have lost fewer home matches over the last two seasons. However, finding victories remains a challenge for Hürzeler’s side. Since December, they have earned just nine points in the Premier League.\n\nPalace arrive on the South Coast struggling for a clinical edge. Notably, the Eagles have underperformed their Expected Goals (xG) by over eight goals since Matchday 16. This represents the worst finishing differential in the entire league. Seven of the last 13 Premier League meetings between these sides have ended in draws. Ismaïla Sarr remains their primary threat, having scored twice on his last visit to the Amex.\n\nBrighton Predicted XI: Verbruggen; Veltman, Van Hecke, Dunk, De Cuyper; Gomez, Baleba, Gross; Rutter, Welbeck, Mitoma\n\nCrystal Palace Predicted XI: Henderson; Richards, Lacroix, Riad; Munoz, Hughes, Wharton, Mitchell; I. Sarr, Pino, Johnson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Main Event.

    "fullText": "Liverpool host Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday while aiming to secure a second consecutive Premier League victory.\n\nThe Reds have moved into second place following their emphatic 4–1 win over Newcastle United. Manager Arne Slot oversaw a return to form for his attacking unit. Hugo Ekitiké was instrumental in that win. He currently averages a goal contribution every 112 minutes. Liverpool boast an incredible home record against City, losing just once in their last 22 meetings at Anfield. A win today would significantly close the gap on league leaders Arsenal.\n\nArne Slot manages a squad coping with several notable absences in the defensive and attacking lines. Notably, Jeremie Frimpong is ruled out with a thigh injury. Alexander Isak also remains on the treatment table. Consequently, Dominik Szoboszlai could start at right-back to provide defensive cover. Florian Wirtz enters the match in scintillating form, boasting nine goal involvements in his last 11 games.\n\nAlisson Becker will start in goal behind a defensive pairing of Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk. Miloš Kerkez is expected to keep his place at left-back. In midfield, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister will anchor the side. Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo will support Ekitiké from wide areas. Liverpool have earned 28 points from losing positions since the start of last season. Their resilience will be vital against the champions.\n\nLiverpool predicted XI: Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Anfield on Sunday, 8 February 2026.

    "fullText": "Brighton host Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium on Sunday while they aim to claim local bragging rights in the M23 derby.\n\nThe Seagulls have moved into mid-table safety despite a league-high 10 draws this season. Manager Fabian Hürzeler oversees a side that remains extremely tough to beat at home. Brighton have lost only twice at the Amex in their last 20 Premier League outings. A victory today would move them above Crystal Palace in the standings. It would also provide a massive psychological boost for the final third of the season.\n\nFabian Hürzeler manages a squad that welcomes back a key midfield presence. Notably, Diego Gomez is fit to start after missing recent matches. However, Yasin Ayari is out after suffering a shoulder injury against Everton. Consequently, Gomez will likely join Carlos Baleba and Pascal Groß in the engine room. Groß recently became the first Brighton player to score under four different Premier League managers.\n\nBart Verbruggen will start in goal behind a defence led by captain Lewis Dunk. James Milner could equal Gareth Barry’s record of 653 Premier League appearances if he features. Notably, Maxim De Cuyper is expected to retain his place at left-back. Danny Welbeck will lead the attack, supported by Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter. The Seagulls will look to improve on their recent form of just nine points since December.\n\nBrighton predicted XI: Verbruggen; Veltman, Van Hecke, Dunk, De Cuyper; Gomez, Baleba, Gross; Rutter, Welbeck, Mitoma\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the American Express Stadium on Sunday, 8 February 2026.

    "fullText": "Anfield plays host to the definitive “main event” of Premier League gameweek 25 this Sunday as Liverpool and Manchester City renew a rivalry that has defined the modern era of English football.\n\nFor Pep Guardiola’s side, the trip to Merseyside is a high-stakes mission to stay within touching distance of league leaders Arsenal. The Citizens could find themselves nine points adrift by kick-off. Consequently, a victory at a ground where they historically struggle is almost non-negotiable. Liverpool appear to be emerging from a difficult winter slump. Arne Slot’s men rediscovered their “killer instinct” with a dominant 4–1 dismantling of Newcastle United last weekend. Sunday’s clash promises a high-octane tactical battle where neither side can afford to blink.\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester City 3–0 Liverpool (9 Nov 2025), Premier League\n\nArne Slot confirmed that Joe Gomez (hip) has a slight chance of making the matchday squad. However, the Reds will be without Jeremie Frimpong (thigh), who was ruled out earlier this week. Liverpool’s injury list also includes Conor Bradley, Alexander Isak, and Giovanni Leoni. On a positive note, Florian Wirtz enters the game in scintillating form. He boasts nine goal involvements in his last 11 appearances.\n\nPep Guardiola remains uncertain regarding the availability of captain Bernardo Silva. In better news, Rúben Dias returned to the bench midweek following a month-long layoff. John Stones has also resumed first-team training. Marc Guéhi is available after being ineligible for the EFL Cup. Erling Haaland is expected to return to the starting lineup after being rested as a substitute against Newcastle.\n\nThe Reds have made Anfield a fortress against today’s visitors. Notably, Liverpool have lost just one of their last 22 Premier League home games against Manchester City. They recently rediscovered their scoring touch in the dominant win over Newcastle. Hugo Ekitiké is proving to be a revelation this term. He averages a goal or assist every 112 minutes, the best debut-season ratio for a Liverpool player since Mohamed Salah.\n\nCity arrive with a strange statistical anomaly in 2026. Notably, they have not conceded a single first-half goal this year. However, they are also the only side yet to score a second-half goal, conceding six in that period. Rayan Cherki remains their primary creative hub, creating three chances per 90 minutes. Notably, Anfield remains one of only two grounds where Erling Haaland has played but never scored.\n\nLiverpool Predicted XI: Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike\n\nManchester City Predicted XI: Donnarumma; Nunes, Guehi, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Reijnders, Semenyo; Haaland\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League, and Sky Ultra HD. Coverage starts at 16:00 GMT.

    "fullText": "Crystal Palace travel to the South Coast on Sunday, aiming to end a dismal nine-match winless run in the Premier League.\n\nThe Eagles have moved into a precarious position, sitting 15th and on the brink of the relegation zone. Manager Oliver Glasner oversees a side that has struggled for goals recently. Palace have underperformed their Expected Goals (xG) by over eight goals since mid-December. However, they remain resilient in derbies, having drawn seven of their last 13 meetings with Brighton. A result today is vital to ease mounting pressure on the squad.\n\nOliver Glasner manages a squad bolstered by the return of its primary midfield anchor. Notably, Adam Wharton is available to start after serving a one-match suspension. However, Eddie Nketiah is set to miss out through injury. Consequently, the manager is expected to rely on Ismaïla Sarr to provide the goals. Sarr has nine goals this season and scored twice on his last visit to the Amex.\n\nDean Henderson will start in goal behind a defensive back three featuring Maxence Lacroix. Daniel Muñoz and Tyrick Mitchell will provide the width from wing-back positions. In midfield, Wharton will partner Will Hughes to provide defensive stability. Yeremy Pino and Brennan Johnson will support Sarr in a flexible front three. Palace must find a clinical edge to avoid becoming the league’s lowest scorers since Matchday 16.\n\nCrystal Palace predicted XI: Henderson; Richards, Lacroix, Riad; Munoz, Hughes, Wharton, Mitchell; I.

    "fullText": "Manchester City travel to Anfield on Sunday, aiming to complete their first league double over Liverpool since 1937.\n\nThe Citizens have moved within touching distance of the top spot. However, manager Pep Guardiola oversees a side that has historically struggled at this venue. City won the reverse fixture 3–0 in November. They arrive in Merseyside seeking to break a curious scoring drought in 2026. While they have not conceded in the first half this year, they are yet to score a second-half goal. A victory today is essential to keep pressure on league leaders Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola manages a squad nearing full strength as key senior figures return to training. Notably, Rúben Dias and John Stones are both back in contention for a starting spot. However, Bernardo Silva remains a doubt following a knock sustained last week. Consequently, Tijjani Reijnders could occupy a central role. Rayan Cherki remains their primary creative outlet, creating three chances per 90 minutes.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma will start in goal behind a defensive line featuring Marc Guéhi. Nathan Aké and Rayan Aït-Nouri will provide the width from full-back roles. In midfield, Rodri will anchor the side alongside youngster Nico O’Reilly. Erling Haaland is expected to return to the starting XI after being rested midweek. Haaland faces a personal challenge, as Anfield is one of only two grounds where he has never scored.\n\nManchester City predicted XI: Donnarumma; Nunes, Guehi, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Reijnders, Semenyo; Haaland\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Anfield on Sunday, 8 February 2026. Kick-off is scheduled for 16:30 GMT.\n\nIn the UK, the match will be broadcast live on Sky Sports Main Event. Fans can also follow the action via the Now TV app.\n\nRead more- Cole Palmer sets new Premier League record with latest hat-trick\n\nSee Also- Thomas Frank ‘proud’ of 10-man Spurs following Man Utd defeat\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "BYU has its first 4-game losing skid of its Big 12 era.\n\nThe 16th-ranked Cougars fell 77-66 to No. 8 Houston Saturday night at the Marriott Center, unable to break out of their recent rut for a potential season-altering, signature win.\n\nBYU is now 17-6 on the season and 5-5 in Big 12 play after beginning 5-1 against conference foes.\n\nFinal score in Provo. pic.twitter.com/0qW6tZoaeK\n\n— BYU Men's Basketball (@BYUMBB) February 8, 2026\n\nBYU’s defense looked better, but the results didn’t improve much. The Cougars have been gashed defensively during their losing streak, most notably having given up 99 points to unranked Oklahoma State.\n\nTo BYU’s credit, the defense did appear more engaged on Saturday. For the most part, the Cougars seemed more locked in and played with more toughness.\n\nHowever, Houston is still Houston.\n\nThe Cougars in red shot 47.5% from the field, 35% from 3-point range and averaged 1.31 points per possession in Provo, only turning the ball over four times. Houston hit a number of tough, contested shots and always found a way to manufacture scoring.\n\nThe defensive effort was better, to be sure. Perhaps that’s something for BYU to build off in order to get out of its current hole, but it still wasn’t nearly good enough.\n\nBYU’s big men struggled. The duo of Keba Keita and Abdullah Ahmed laid a major egg on Saturday, combining to shoot 3 of 10 from the field and 3 of 7 from the free throw line.\n\nKeita and Ahmed also managed just eight total rebounds in 38 minutes on the floor, getting beaten often on the glass to allow Houston to grab 13 offensive boards.\n\nAdditionally, Richie Saunders had his worst outing in recent memory by scoring just seven points on 1 of 8 shooting with three turnovers and a game-low minus-18 plus/minus, though he did post seven rebounds and four assists.\n\nAhmed’s five points were the only bench scoring for BYU all night, with the blue Cougars missing 12 free throws as well in the 11-point loss.\n\nThe water’s getting deep for BYU. Before the season, did anyone expect the Cougars to drop four straight games at any point this year?\n\nIt feels inevitable that the preseason No. 8 team in the country is about to fall out of Monday’s new AP Top 25 poll.\n\nBYU has lost five of its past six, only having beaten lowly Utah in that stretch. Four of those Cougar losses have come to ranked foes — in addition to the shocking letdown at Oklahoma State — but that’s a whole other problem altogether.\n\nBYU can’t beat the best of the Big 12. Kevin Young’s crew isn’t among the upper portion of the league.\n\nBYU’s bracketology picture is getting blurrier, as the prospect of receiving a top-16 protected seed on selection Sunday is slipping away with each new loss. The recent losses are making it much, much more difficult to find a favorable tournament road in March.\n\nBYU will look to get back to its winning ways Tuesday at Baylor, but as evidenced in Stillwater, road wins aren’t simple in the Big 12.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea striker Liam Delap is reportedly now playing for his future at the club in the second half of this Premier League season.\n\nDelap has been struggling at the club since he arrived from Ipswich Town in the summer transfer window. As well as with his form on the pitch, he has struggled with injuries off it too.\n\nI think Delap is a decent striker, but I’m starting to wonder whether he might just suit a team that plays on transition rather than possession based. He seems to be really struggling with Chelsea’s style of play. But maybe he can grow into it and get used to it a bit more? Well, apparently he has half a season to prove he can, otherwise Chelsea are looking to sell him…\n\nLiam Delap with Liam Rosenior in training. (Photo by Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC)\n\nLiam Delap’s former suitors are keeping a very close eye on developments at Stamford Bridge, with TEAMtalk reporting that the striker is effectively playing for his Chelsea future in the second half of the campaign.\n\nManchester United, Newcastle United and Everton all pushed hard for his signature before his move to Stamford Bridge, and all three clubs are apparently monitoring the situation closely should Chelsea decide to listen to offers. The report goes on to say that other clubs such as Brighton and Sunderland are also watching.\n\nChelsea beat Wolves 3-1 yesterday afternoon in their latest Premier League game, effectively winning the game in the first half by scoring all three of their goals to put it out of reach for the home side.\n\nCole Palmer was the hat-trick hero of the day, getting all three of Chelsea’s goals in the first half to announce himself fully back and ready for the rest of the campaign.",

When City play Liverpool, it is one of the biggest Premier League fixtures of the season. Today’s match is no exceptionn, especially for Pep Guardiola’s side. City enter today’s match nine points behind Arsenal, who sit clear at the top of the Premier League. Manchester City have to beat Liverpool today at a ground where they typically don’t play well to keep in touch with Mikel Arteta’s side.\n\nHere is the latest Manchester City injury and team news, and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of today’s match.\n\nOn the injury front, Josko Gvardiol, Savinho, Mateo Kovacic and Jeremy Doku will all miss today’s match. The quartet have all been ruled out of the crucial Premier League fixture at Anfield. Bernardo Silva is also in doubt for today’s match. The City captain missed Manchester City’s win over Newcastle due to a hamstring injury. Pep Guardiola confirmed on Friday that Bernardo Silva is in doubt for today’s match.\n\nIn good news for City, Ruben Dias has trained all week and is available to play against Liverpool. It remains to be seen if he will start at Anfield. With Bernardo Silva in doubt for today’s match, Pep Guardiola may prefer to start Dias given the leadership that the Portuguese international provides. John Stones has finally returned to training after a lengthy injury layoff, but today’s match has likely come too soon for Stones to play any part.\n\nMarc Guehi is available to play today. Guehi was ineligible for Manchester City’s Carabao Cup semi-final second-leg tie against Newcastle.",

    "description": "ClawHub skills are now scanned by VirusTotal's threat intelligence platform—bringing industry-leading security to the AI agent ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "Today we’re announcing a partnership with VirusTotal, the world’s leading threat intelligence platform, to bring security scanning to ClawHub—OpenClaw’s skill marketplace.\n\nTL;DR: All skills published to ClawHub are now scanned using VirusTotal’s threat intelligence, including their new Code Insight capability. This provides an additional layer of security for the OpenClaw community.\n\nFor the past 20 years, security models have been built around locking devices and applications down—setting boundaries between inter-process communications, separating internet from local, sandboxing untrusted code. These principles remain important.\n\nBut AI agents represent a fundamental shift.\n\nUnlike traditional software that does exactly what code tells it to do, AI agents interpret natural language and make decisions about actions. They blur the boundary between user intent and machine execution. They can be manipulated through language itself.\n\nWe understand that with the great utility of a tool like OpenClaw comes great responsibility. Done wrong, an AI agent is a liability. Done right, we can change personal computing for the better.\n\nOpenClaw skills are powerful. They extend what your AI agent can do—from controlling smart home devices to managing finances to automating workflows. But with that power comes risk.\n\nSkills are code that runs in your agent’s context, with access to your tools and your data. A malicious skill could:\n\nAs the OpenClaw ecosystem grows, so does the attack surface. We’ve already seen documented cases of malicious actors attempting to exploit AI agent platforms. We’re not waiting for this to become a bigger problem.\n\nWhen a skill is published to ClawHub:\n\nScan results are displayed on every skill page and in version history, with direct links to the full VirusTotal report.\n\nVirusTotal already protects the Hugging Face ecosystem using hash-based lookups against their threat intelligence database. Our integration goes further—we upload full skill bundles for Code Insight analysis, giving the AI a complete picture of the skill’s behavior rather than just matching known signatures.\n\nLet’s be clear: this is not a silver bullet.\n\nVirusTotal scanning won’t catch everything. A skill that uses natural language to instruct an agent to do something malicious won’t trigger a virus signature. A carefully crafted prompt injection payload won’t show up in a threat database.\n\nSecurity is defense in depth. This is one layer. More are coming.\n\nThis partnership is part of a broader security initiative at OpenClaw. In the coming days, we’ll be publishing:\n\nFollow progress and read the full security program overview at trust.openclaw.ai.\n\nWe’ve brought on Jamieson O’Reilly (founder of Dvuln, co-founder of Aether AI, CREST Advisory Council member) as lead security advisor to guide this program.\n\nAI agents that take real-world actions deserve real security processes. We’re building them.\n\nIf you publish skills to ClawHub, your code will now be scanned automatically. Here’s how it works:\n\nWe expect some false positives initially—security tooling isn’t perfect. If your skill is incorrectly flagged, reach out to us at security@openclaw.ai and we’ll review it.\n\nWhen browsing ClawHub, you’ll see scan status for each skill. This gives you one more data point when deciding what to trust. But remember:\n\nWe’re grateful to Bernardo Quintero and the VirusTotal team for their partnership. Their platform protects millions of users every day, and we’re proud to bring that protection to the OpenClaw community.\n\nThis is the beginning, not the end. We’re committed to making OpenClaw the most secure AI agent platform available. Expect more announcements soon.\n\nQuestions about security? security@openclaw.ai\n\n— Peter, Jamieson, and Bernardo",

    "fullText": "Mario Tchou (simplified Chinese: 马里奥·朱; traditional Chinese: 馬里奧·朱; 1924–1961), also known as Tchou Wang Li, was an Italian engineer of Chinese descent. He was a pioneer of computer science in Italy, who led a group of scientists from the University of Pisa to invent in 1959 the Olivetti Elea—the world's most powerful computer at the time.\n\nBorn in Rome on 26 June 1924, he was the son of Evelyn Wang and the diplomat Yin Tchou, who worked within the Consulate of the Republic of China at the Holy See.[citation needed]\n\nAfter obtaining his classical high school diploma at the Torquato Tasso Gymnasium High School in Rome, he undertook his studies in electrical engineering in Rome, at the La Sapienza University, and continued them with a scholarship in the United States, where, in 1947, he obtained a Bachelor of electrical engineering at the Catholic University of America in Washington.[1] He graduated from the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering in 1949.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8]\n\nHaving moved to New York, he began teaching at Manhattan College while, at the same time, he specialized at the Polytechnic University of New York in Brooklyn, where, in 1949, he obtained a Master of Science with a thesis entitled Ultrasonic Diffraction. In the same year he married the Italian Mariangela Siracusa. In 1952, at the age of 28, he was called to teach at Columbia University in New York, in the department led by John R. Ragazzini.\n\nAfter the separation from his first wife, he married the artist Elisa Montessori in 1955, and they had two daughters.[9][10]\n\nGiven his knowledge of electronics, in 1955 Adriano Olivetti hired him into the company and entrusted him with the task of forming a working group which, in collaboration with the University of Pisa, had the aim of designing and building an all Italian electronic calculator, at the suggestion of Enrico Fermi, using the 150 million lire already allocated (for a synchrotron later built in Frascati) for the Pisan Electronic Calculator with valves and transistors. In the same year he separated from his first wife and remarried the painter Elisa Montessori, with whom he had two daughters. He later began working on the largest Olivetti Elea, the greatest transistor supercomputer of the time, later built in 40 examples.\n\nMario Tchou's activity was based on a vision that focused on high innovation. In the laboratory of Barbaricina (a district of the city of Pisa) he gathered the best brains, all young: \"Because new things are only done with young people. Only young people throw themselves into it with enthusiasm, and collaborate in harmony without personalism and without the obstacles deriving from a customary mentality.\" He considered Italy \"at the same level as the most advanced countries in the field of electronic calculating machines from a qualitative point of view. The others, however, receive enormous help from the state. The United States allocates huge sums for electronic research, especially for military purposes. Britain also spends millions of pounds. Olivetti's effort is relatively notable, but the others have a more secure future than ours, being helped by the State\"\n\nThe young engineer personally tried to get closer to Ivrea, the historic headquarters of Olivetti, to break down the wall of distrust that the employees of the mechanical sector had towards the newly formed electronics division, but his attempts were in vain: the mechanical and electronic sectors remained divided, like their respective headquarters, one in Ivrea, the other in Borgolombardo, a hamlet of San Giuliano Milanese, where the Barbaricina group moved in 1960. The engineer was placed in charge of the newly established Electronic Research Laboratory (LRE).\n\nMario Tchou died together with his driver Francesco Frinzi (1933–1961) in a tragic car accident on the morning of 9 November 1961, at just 37 years old, on the Milan-Turin motorway overpass, just before the Santhià toll booth; the driver lost control of the car after overtaking and crashed into a van.[11] That morning Tchou was traveling to Ivrea to discuss the design of a new transistor architecture.[citation needed]\n\nThe sudden death of Tchou, a year after that of Adriano Olivetti, decreed the end of the Elea project and closed an important season for Italian electronics, which at the time saw the industrial and technological leadership of Olivetti. The electronics division was decommissioned and sold to General Electric in 1964.",

    "fullText": "Will Lewis, the former CEO and publisher of the Washington Post, had a terrible tenure at the paper. The two years he spent there, which ended Saturday with a two-paragraph memo, are chiefly notable for a series of cuts and layoffs, culminating in a 30% bloodletting days ago.\n\nBut let's be clear: This one is on Jeff Bezos.\n\nMost obviously, that's because Bezos owns the Post, and Bezos was the one who hired Lewis to run the business for him.\n\nBezos was also the one signing off on Lewis's actions at the paper, which mostly amounted to making the paper smaller while telling the staff that \"people are not reading your stuff.\"\n\nAnd slightly less obviously, it was Bezos who dramatically worsened the Post's business outlook. He decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024, weeks before the election — a move that outraged many Post readers, who saw the non-endorsement as an attempt to cater to Donald Trump.\n\nThat led to more than 250,000 subscriber cancellations, a huge problem for a paper whose circulation peaked at 3 million in 2021.\n\nThe best case argument you could make for Lewis era at the Post, if you are inclined, would go something like this: Bezos, who bought the Post in 2013 and then invested heavily in staff, realized a few years ago that he now employed many more people than his business would support. So he brought Lewis in to do the grim work of shrinking the publication. Now that work is done, so Lewis can do something else and Bezos can find someone to help the Post grow again.\n\nBut the timing of Lewis' departure — late afternoon on a Saturday, following days of howling from Post employees and many others about Lewis and Bezos' stewardship of the paper — suggests this was not a long-in-the-making move.\n\nAnd again, whether Lewis jumped or was pushed doesn't matter in the end. The Washington Post is Jeff Bezos. He gets praise if things are going well — which, for several years after his purchase, seemed to be the case — and blame when it doesn't.\n\nHere I'll also point out that Bezos, who has no problem being seen jet-setting around the world in a style befitting the world's fourth-richest man, has been totally MIA during his paper's recent turmoil.\n\nOn Saturday, when the paper announced it had promoted Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio to acting publisher and CEO, Bezos finally attached his name to a public statement, promising that the new Post would thrive by giving readers things they wanted to read.\n\n\"The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,\" he said in a Post press release.\n\nThat might qualify for an insight 30 years ago, when newspapers were struggling to respond to the internet. Now that's table stakes, and you would hope the guy who created Amazon has more up his sleeve.\n\n\"I have a bunch of ideas,\" for the Post, Bezos said in the fall of 2024. \"I'm working on that right now.\"",

But it's not too late to save The Post. Jeff Bezos must immediately rescind these layoffs or sell the paper to someone willing to invest in its future.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Post union did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOn social media, laid-off reporters celebrated the news of Lewis' departure. Jada Yuan, a former culture writer at the Post, wrote that she had \"never been more thrilled with a news alert.\"\n\n\"Will Lewis, the absent, ineffective publisher of @washingtonpost has resigned. Or been fired,\" she added. \"It sucks that it happened after he couldn't even show up on zoom to lay off 1/3 of the company. But the important thing is he's gone.\"\n\nLewis' exit was announced Saturday afternoon, just days after sweeping layoffs hit the legacy publication, leaving hundreds of reporters out of work.\n\nThe publication's unionized employees held a \"Save the Post\" rally earlier this week, focused on Bezos and Lewis, and said there were risks to press freedom and independent news if legacy publications like the Post are unable to continue operating.",

    "description": "Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has put out his first statement since the paper's cuts. He said \"data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.\"",
    "fullText": "Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos gave his first public statement since the paper enacted massive job cuts this week, and it focused on \"data\" and understanding reader interests.\n\nThe billionaire Amazon founder, who built one of the world's most valuable companies with a relentless focus on customer satisfaction, indicated he wanted to see that same energy at the Post.\n\n\"The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity,\" Bezos wrote. \"Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.\"\n\nBezos' statement came as Post CEO Will Lewis announced he was stepping down, to be replaced in an interim capacity by Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio.\n\nIn his own statement, D'Onofrio said that \"customer data will drive our decisions, sharpening our edge in delivering what is most valuable to our audiences.\"\n\nBezos and D'Onofrio's statements struck a similar tone to comments made by the paper's top editor, Matt Murray, in addressing staff earlier this week.\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray said during a staff call on Wednesday. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"\n\nFollowing the layoffs, Murray spoke repeatedly about focusing on areas of reader interest and understanding audience data in an appearance on the Puck podcast \"The Grill Room.\"\n\nHe said that when he was brought on, he felt the company hadn't \"fully embraced the digital internet revolution the right way.\"\n\nHe added that the company had a \"long way to go in using data — data to inform what we wrote, data to inform how we publish, data to understand our audience, data to understand our readers, data to understand our prospects.\"\n\nThe outspoken focus on data from Post leadership has drawn some criticism.\n\n\"'Customer data' is what has replaced 'focus group' for the same type of folks who pretty much killed Sports Illustrated by stamping out its originality and magnetism in favor of formulaic swill,\" The Atlantic's Sally Jenkins, formerly of the Post, wrote Saturday on X.\n\nStill, the messaging from Post leadership could help appease some critics who have seen management moves in recent years as rooted in political ideology and not data — though it will be difficult to win them over.\n\nThe Post faced a revolt both inside the newsroom and among readers when Bezos made a late-hour call in 2024 that the paper wouldn't endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in 36 years. NPR reported that more than 200,000 subscriptions were canceled in the days following.\n\nThe paper faced another round of criticism in February 2025 when Bezos decided to reorient the Post's opinion section — generally considered the owner's prerogative — around personal liberties and free markets.\n\nFormer Post executive editor Martin Baron, who worked closely with Bezos during his tenure atop the paper, wrote in a LinkedIn post after the layoffs that the Post's challenges had been made \"infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nCritics of Bezos' moves have said he should consider financially supporting the paper, given its role in society.\n\n\"It just seems heartbreaking that he doesn't feel the paper is important enough to bankroll,\" Sally Quinn, the longtime journalist and widow of former Post executive editor, Ben Bradlee, said this week on CNN.\n\nBezos said in his statement that he felt the Post's leadership going forward could build an \"exciting and thriving next chapter\" for the paper.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Italian police fired tear gas and a water cannon at dozens of protesters who threw firecrackers and tried to access a highway near a Winter Olympics venue on Saturday.\n\nThe brief confrontation came at the end of a peaceful march by thousands against the environmental impact of the Games and the presence of U.S. agents in Italy.\n\nPolice held off the violent demonstrators, who appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink, after the skirmish. By then, the larger peaceful protest, including families with small children and students, had dispersed.\n\nEarlier, a group of masked protesters had set off smoke bombs and firecrackers on a bridge overlooking a construction site about 800 meters (a half-mile) from the Olympic Village that's housing around 1,500 athletes.\n\nPolice vans behind a temporary metal fence secured the road to the athletes’ village, but the protest veered away, continuing on a trajectory toward the Santagiulia venue. A heavy police presence guarded the entire route.\n\nThere was no indication that the protest and resulting road closure interfered with athletes’ transfers to their events, all on the outskirts of Milan.\n\nThe demonstration coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Milan as head of the American delegation that attended the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nHe and his family visited Leonardo da Vinci's “The Last Supper” closer to the city center, far from the protest, which also was against the deployment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to provide security to the U.S. delegation.\n\nU.S. Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the U.S. is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.\n\nAt the larger, peaceful demonstration, which police said numbered 10,000, people carried cardboard cutouts to represent trees felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina. A group of dancers performed to beating drums. Music blasted from a truck leading the march, one a profanity-laced anti-ICE anthem.\n\n“Let’s take back the cities and free the mountains,” read a banner by a group calling itself the Unsustainable Olympic Committee. Another group called the Association of Proletariat Excursionists organized the cutout trees.\n\n“They bypassed the laws that usually are needed for major infrastructure project, citing urgency for the Games,” said protester Guido Maffioli, who expressed concern that the private entity organizing the Games would eventually pass on debt to Italian taxpayers.\n\nHomemade signs read “Get out of the Games: Genocide States, Fascist Police and Polluting Sponsors,” the final one a reference to fossil fuel companies that are sponsors of the Games. One woman carried an artificial tree on her back decorated with the sign: “Infernal Olympics.”\n\nThe demonstration followed another last week when hundreds protested the deployment of ICE agents.\n\nLike last week, demonstrators Saturday said they were opposed to ICE agents’ presence, despite official statements that a small number of agents from an investigative arm would be present in U.S. diplomatic territory, and not operational on the streets.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — For days, Luis Ramirez had an uneasy feeling about the men dressed as utility workers he’d seen outside his family’s Mexican restaurant in suburban Minneapolis.\n\nThey wore high-visibility vests and spotless white hard hats, he noticed, even while parked in their vehicle. His search for the Wisconsin-based electrician advertised on the car’s doors returned no results.\n\nOn Tuesday, when their Nissan returned to the lot outside his restaurant, Ramirez, 31, filmed his confrontation with the two men, who hide their faces as he approaches and appear to be wearing heavy tactical gear beneath their yellow vests.\n\n“This is what our taxpayer money goes to: renting these vehicles with fake tags to come sit here and watch my business,” Ramirez shouts in the video.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to inquiries about whether the men were federal immigration officers. But encounters like Ramirez's have become increasingly common.\n\nAs the sweeping immigration crackdown in Minnesota continues, legal observers and officials say they have received a growing number of reports of federal agents impersonating construction workers, delivery drivers and in some cases anti-ICE activists.\n\nNot all of those incidents have been verified, but they have heightened fears in a state already on edge, adding to legal groups' concerns about the Trump administration’s dramatic reshaping of immigration enforcement tactics nationwide.\n\n“If you have people afraid that the electrical worker outside their house might be ICE, you’re inviting public distrust and confusion on a much more dangerous level,” said Naureen Shah, the director of immigration advocacy at the American Civil Liberties Union. “This is what you do if you’re trying to control a populace, not trying to do routine, professional law enforcement.”\n\nA ‘more extreme degree’ of deception\n\nIn the past, immigration authorities have sometimes used disguises and other deceptions, which they call ruses, to gain entry into homes without a warrant.\n\nThe tactics became more common during President Donald Trump’s first term, attorneys said, prompting an ACLU lawsuit accusing immigration agents of violating the U.S. Constitution by posing as local law enforcement during home raids. A recent settlement restricted the practice in Los Angeles. But ICE deceptions remain legal elsewhere in the country.\n\nStill, the undercover operations reported in Minnesota would appear to be a “more extreme degree than we’ve seen in the past,” said Shah, in part because they seem to be happening in plain sight.\n\nWhere past ruses were aimed at deceiving immigration targets, the current tactics may also be a response to the Minnesota's sprawling networks of citizen observers that have sought to call attention to federal agents before they make arrests.\n\nAt the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, the city’s central hub of ICE activity, activists told The Associated Press they had seen agents leaving in vehicles with stuffed animals on their dashboards or Mexican flag decals on their bumpers. Pickups with lumber or tools in their beds were also frequently spotted.\n\nIn recent weeks, federal agents have repeatedly shown up to construction sites dressed as workers, according to Jose Alvillar, a lead organizer for the local immigrant rights group, Unidos MN.\n\n“We’ve seen an increase in the cowboy tactics,” he said, though he noted the raids had not resulted in arrests. “Construction workers are good at identifying who is a real construction worker and who is dressing up as one.”\n\nSince the start of the operation in Minnesota, local officials, including Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, have said ICE agents had been seen swapping license plates or using bogus ones, a violation of state law.\n\nCandice Metrailer, an antiques dealer in south Minneapolis, believes she witnessed such an attempt firsthand.\n\nOn Jan. 13, she received a call from a man who identified himself as a collector, asking if her store sold license plates. She said it did. A few minutes later, two men in street clothes entered the shop and began looking through her collection of vintage plates.\n\n“One of them says, ‘Hey, do you have any recent ones?’” Metrailer recalled. “Immediately, an alarm bell went off in my head.”\n\nMetrailer stepped outside while the men continued browsing. A few doors down from the shop, she saw an idling Ford Explorer with blacked out windows. She memorized its license plate, then quickly plugged it into a crowdsourced database used by local activists to track vehicles linked to immigration enforcement.\n\nThe database shows an identical Ford with the same plates had been photographed leaving the Whipple building seven times and reported at the scene of an immigration arrest weeks earlier.\n\nWhen one of the men approached the register holding a white Minnesota plate, Metrailer said she told him that the store had a new policy against selling the items.\n\nMetrailer said she had reported the incident to Minnesota’s attorney general. A spokesperson for DHS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSupporters of the immigration crackdown say the volunteer army of ICE-tracking activists in Minneapolis has forced federal agents to adopt new methods of avoiding detection.\n\n“Of course agents are adapting their tactics so that they’re a step ahead,” said Scott Mechkowski, former deputy director of ICE enforcement and operations in New York City. “We’ve never seen this level of obstruction and interference.”\n\nIn nearly three decades in immigration enforcement, Mechkowski said he also hadn’t seen ICE agent disguising themselves as uniformed workers in the course of making arrests.\n\nEarlier this summer, a spokesperson for DHS confirmed a man wearing a high-visibility construction vest was an ICE agent conducting surveillance. In Oregon, a natural gas company published guidance last month on how customers could identify their employees after reports of federal impersonators.\n\nIn the days since his encounter, Ramirez, the restaurant worker, said he has been on high alert for undercover agents. He recently stopped a locksmith who he feared might be a federal agent, before quickly realizing he was a local resident.\n\n“Everybody is on edge about these guys, man,” Ramirez said. “It feels like they’re everywhere.”",

    "fullText": "President Trump is pleading with November voters to remember his policy victories—and not his racist Truth Social posts.\n\nTrump, 79, took to his social media platform Friday evening to brag about rolling back Obama-era restrictions on commercial fishing off the coast of New England. The post came one day after Trump earned widespread condemnation for posting an AI-generated video depicting the Obamas as apes.\n\n“Today, I signed a Presidential Proclamation to UNLEASH Commercial Fishing in the Atlantic Ocean, advancing the America First Fishing Policy!“, Trump wrote.\n\n“Please remember I did this for you, against strong Democrat opposition, and VOTE REPUBLICAN IN THE MIDTERMS!”\n\nTrump’s Friday proclamation “restores commercial fishing access to all 4,913 square miles of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, located off the coast of New England.”\n\nPresident Obama established the nearly 5,000-square-mile preserve east of Cape Cod in 2016, looking to protect vulnerable undersea coral ecosystems. Trump rolled back the protections in his first term, and Joe Biden restored them during his.\n\nTrump described the proclamation as a benevolent favor to the New England area, which has voted for the Democratic candidate in all three presidential elections in which Trump has been on the ballot.\n\n“Hard to believe you vote for Democrats who did this to you, but not for ‘TRUMP,’ who gets you out of this Environmental and Economic Malaise,” the president scolded, adding, “VOTE REPUBLICAN FROM NOW ON!”\n\nTrump’s plea for midterm momentum comes at a time when all signs point to the Democrats dominating the GOP in November, with a serious chance to win back both chambers of Congress.\n\nTrump’s awful polling on the economy and immigration—two issues that were strengths for him in his 2024 election victory—has become an albatross for vulnerable Republican incumbents.\n\nNow, beleaguered GOP politicians have to square their re-election bids with their party leader posting grossly racist videos of his old political foes.\n\nTrump posted a video that featured the heads of Barack and Michelle Obama superimposed onto apes during a late Thursday night posting spree.\n\nThe administration has thrown a myriad of excuses at the controversy. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was merely a Lion King meme, even though there are no apes in The Lion King. Trump said he didn’t see the offending part of the video, as it occurs toward the end of the clip.\n\nThe GOP is reportedly panicking over the post.\n\n“I talked to several House members that are just besides themselves, and they don’t know how they’re going to handle it on the road,” Mulvaney added.\n\nNotably, some GOP incumbents have broken from Trump on the video. Nebraska Senator Pete Ricketts, up for reelection in 2026, was among several GOP politicians who unequivocally condemned Trump’s racist Obama post.\n\n“Even if this was a Lion King meme, a reasonable person sees the racist context to this,” he posted on X. “The White House should do what anyone does when they make a mistake: remove this and apologize.”",

    "fullText": "Former Cowboys star reveals he was almost traded to Eagles originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys traded star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers before the start of the 2025 NFL season.\n\nBut according to Parsons, he was very close to becoming a member of the Philadelphia Eagles before he was ultimately shipped to Green Bay.\n\n“To be honest with you, bro, it was very close. It was very close to being the Eagles. Before the Jaelen Phillips [trade], it was me,” Parsons said of a trade to the Eagles on a recent episode of his podcast.\n\nParsons says he nixed the potential trade to Philadelphia because it would have required the Eagles to part ways stud defensive tackle Jalen Carter, who Parsons would have wanted to play alongside.\n\nMore: A.J. Brown sends clear message regarding his future with Eagles\n\n“Yeah, it was me and I was really about to come but there was one person that I had to play with that if he was gone I did not want to be there, and that was Jalen Carter,\" Parsons said.\n\n\"They wanted a defensive tackle. And they wanted to trade me plus some picks. I don't really care about the picks, but I'm coming to play next to J.C., you feel me? … So, sorry, Cowboys fans. It really almost happened.”\n\nIt’s fair to wonder exactly how accurate this account of the situation is, or if the Cowboys would have actually traded Parsons to another team in the NFC East. But, if Parsons is to be believed, it certainly sounds like he was pretty close to becoming an Eagle.\n\nThat would have been something that probably wouldn’t have sat well with Cowboys fans. Losing Parsons is one thing, but losing him to a divisional rival that you have to play twice a season would be like salt in the wound.\n\nKey coach announces departure from Philadelphia Eagles\n\nPatriots legend calls out Tom Brady for Super Bowl prediction\n\nDallas Cowboys' 2026 breakout candidate revealed by Pro Football Focus",

    "description": "Speaking with MLB Network, UCLA shortstop Roch Cholowsky reflects on his breakout Bruins season, his path away from football, and how a lifetime around professional scouting has shaped him into a potential No. 1 overall pick.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES -- Roch Cholowsky has never lacked perspective on where he is — or where he’s headed.\n\n“It's a special award, the best of the best win it.” 😤@UCLABaseball standout Roch Cholowsky joined #MLBNHotStove to discuss the upcoming season and the @USAGoldenSpikes Award.\n\nFind out the full #GoldenSpikes Preseason Watch List today at 3pm ET! pic.twitter.com/R1HUpVhy85\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 6, 2026\n\nThe UCLA shortstop, widely viewed as a potential No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming MLB Draft, recently reflected on a Bruins program that rebounded sharply after a difficult stretch, setting the stage for what could be a defining year in his baseball journey. After going 19–33 during his freshman season, Cholowsky said the team made a conscious decision to stay unified, recommit in the offseason, and reset expectations.\n\nThat approach paid off. UCLA surged to a fifth-place finish last season and returns much of its core, giving Cholowsky confidence that the Bruins can build on that momentum. While outside recognition has followed, including early Golden Spikes Award buzz, Cholowsky emphasized that team success remains the priority. Individual honors, he noted, would be meaningful, but a national championship is the ultimate goal.\n\nBeing mentioned alongside past Golden Spikes winners is not something Cholowsky takes lightly. He described the award as baseball’s equivalent of the Heisman, reserved for the game’s elite, and acknowledged that hearing his name in that conversation is both humbling and motivating. Still, he views it as a byproduct of doing the right things on the field rather than a singular pursuit.\n\nCholowsky’s long-term vision was already clear coming out of high school, when he went undrafted despite interest from several clubs. He said most teams understood he was committed to UCLA, a decision he felt was the right one after experiencing college baseball firsthand. The limited draft dialogue only reinforced his belief that development and patience would pay off.\n\nThat clarity extended to his choice to step away from football. A standout high school quarterback, Cholowsky admitted it was difficult to leave the sport behind, but focusing exclusively on baseball allowed him to fully invest in his growth. Once acclimated, he said, his progress accelerated.\n\nFew players arrive at that crossroads with Cholowsky’s background. His father, Dan, spent years in professional baseball as both a player and a scout, giving Roch a rare window into the evaluation process from a young age. From sitting in on in-home scouting meetings to hearing firsthand stories about elite prospects, those experiences shaped how he understands the game.\n\nFor Cholowsky, that foundation — combined with performance — has positioned him for an extraordinary few months ahead, even as he remains grounded in the work still to be done.",

    "title": "Did ESPN Steal Cowboys Scoop? George Pickens Franchise Tag Contract Update",
    "description": "Cowboys Roundtable had the George Pickens scoop more than two months ago. So how is a major Cowboys story being claimed by ESPN as an exclusive?",
    "fullText": "ESPN's Adam Schefter is using Super Bowl Weekend to promote what he is characterizing as a \"scoop'' regarding George Pickens.\n\nThe problem? To put a very fine point on this: The Dallas Cowboys' plan with George Pickens and the franchise tag is not Schefter's scoop.\n\nSchefter writes, \"The Dallas Cowboys are expected to place their franchise tag on Pro Bowl wide receiver George Pickens, league sources told ESPN.''\n\nYeah, we know, Adam. It's just that you're more than two months late.\n\nSchefter is right. Just like our Mike Fisher was right on Nov. 27 when he broke the first sourced story on Dallas' intentions here at CowboysRoundtable.com. ... and it is therefore disingenuous for Schefter and ESPN to pretend they're \"breaking a story'' here.\n\nSome might even accuse them of \"stealing credit for a story.''\n\nIs there really anything new here? We'll credit colleague Calvin Watkins of the Dallas News for noting that the Cowboys have yet to alert Pickens' agent to the plan. (Maybe somebody will alert Schefter to this so he can claim another \"scoop''!)\n\nAnd we're trying to explain to the world that the Cowboys can create plenty of cap room (without CeeDee Lamb having to give up salary) to make it happen.\n\nThe original story (with the link above), reprinted verbatim from Nov. 27 here at CowboysRoundtable.com reads as follows ...\n\nGeorge Pickens is taking full advantage of existing in the eye of a perfect storm.\n\nLast spring, the Dallas Cowboys were desperate to trade for an explosive offensive weapon. Pickens left Pittsburgh and its mediocre quarterback play and created instant chemistry with Pro Bowl QB Dak Prescott. And in a contract year, he's posting the best numbers of his career.\n\n“I’m really just grinding,” Pickens said modestly, reflecting on a 2025 campaign during which he's second among all NFL players in receiving yards (1,054) and third in receiving touchdowns (eight). This is kind of always what I was capable of. …\n\n\"Hopefully, I can just keep doing what I’m doing. Stay in the lab.”\n\nAnd if he continues even near this pace? And continues to put his Steelers-era behavioral baggage behind him?\n\nAs he's in the final year of his rookie contract, the free-agent-to-be will move from the lab to the negotiating table.\n\nAnd amid much speculation on Dallas' plan in that regard? A source is making is very clear to me.\n\n\"The first step, the easy step, is the franchise tag,'' the source said. \"And then we go from there.''\n\nThe Steelers traded Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick to the Cowboys in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick, and at the time, Dallas knew this might just be a risky rental.\n\nBut now? Pickens is described by Prescott as being other-wordly.\n\n“He’s not from this planet,’‘ Dak said.\n\nAnd \"GP'' is developing to the point at which he's seen as an equal to teammate and fast friend CeeDee Lamb. The four-time Pro Bowler Lamb makes $34 million APY - a top-three number in the NFL, behind only Cincinnati's Ja'Marr Chase ($40 mil) and Minnesota's Justin Jefferson ($36 mil).\n\nPickens' agent, David Mulugheta, can reasonably be planning on asking for the same.\n\nCan Dallas afford that? Unquestionably, as a simple seven-step program (which we illustrate in great detail here) can free up $110 million under the 2026 cap of about $295.5 million.\n\nWill Dallas pay that? It doesn't have to. ... because of the tag, projected to be a guaranteed $28 million for 2026.\n\nDoes Cowboys owner Jerry Jones envision any scenario in which where Pickens plays anywhere other than Dallas in 2026?\n\n“No, I do not at this time,’’ Jones said on 105.3 The Fan this week. \"We've got two No. 1 receivers and that's just exceptional right at the time, guess what? Our quarterback (Dak Prescott) is probably the best that he's ever been. There's more there.\"\n\n\"The Dak Window'' is one reason to commit to keeping Pickens, who is just 24. He oversees what is now the No. 1 offense in the league, but he's 32. It makes sense for Dallas to shoot its shot while Prescott remains a viable star.\n\nDallas will open negotiations with Pickens after the completion of this season. What could go wrong?\n\nThere is the unlikely scenario in which Pickens loses control of his emotions or shows a selfish side; some in Pittsburgh saw those things as problems, which led to the Steelers' willingness to give up on him.\n\nJones doesn't see that happening.\n\n\"He's an outstanding teammate,\" Jones said. \"He brings energy to the team even when he's not making some of those great receptions. Bottom line, it's working, and it's precious to have it here right at this time with what we're trying to do with Dak and how we're trying to maximize having him.\"\n\nOr, the Cowboys could drag their feet. Or the agent could drag his. But even in that scenario, if negotiations don't progress, Dallas plans to tag him by March 3. And if no deal is reached by mid-July?\n\nPickens is a Cowboy on the tag.\n\n“Of course we want George Pickens back,” Cowboys COO Stephen Jones said last week on The Fan. “You’d be crazy not to want to have him back and be a part of this thing.''\n\nAnd the tool that is franchise tag is the not-crazy and near-perfect way Pickens is all but guaranteed to remain in Dallas.",

    "title": "13 Free Agent Safeties the Detroit Lions MUST Consider",
    "description": "Here’s every free agent safety the Detroit Lions should consider.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions head into the 2026 offseason with one defensive reality staring them in the face: safety depth is no longer a luxury — it’s a necessity.\n\nBrian Branch is still recovering from a torn Achilles, an injury that often requires careful workload management even after a successful rehab. Meanwhile, Kerby Joseph has been dealing with a lingering knee issue that followed him through much of the season. While it hasn’t been labeled career-threatening, it’s also not something that simply “goes away” with a few weeks of rest.\n\nFor a defense that relies heavily on interchangeable safeties who can play deep, in the box, and in the slot, Detroit needs answers, and likely more than one.\n\nBelow is a look at 13 free-agent safeties the Lions should evaluate as they shape the 2026 roster.\n\nCurl is one of the most well-rounded safeties on the market. Still just 27 years old, he has quietly been one of the most consistent defensive backs in the league over the past four seasons.\n\nHe allowed only one touchdown in coverage in 2025 and owns an 81.8 PFF overall grade over the last four years — ranking 13th among qualifying safeties. Curl offers reliability, positional flexibility, and durability, making him a strong fit for Detroit’s system.\n\nAt 32, Byard remains one of the smartest and most instinctive safeties in football. He led the league with seven interceptions in 2025 and posted an 80.3 PFF grade while continuing to excel against the run.\n\nFor a Lions defense managing injuries, Byard’s leadership, communication, and play recognition could be invaluable, even if the contract is short-term.\n\nPeppers brings versatility few safeties can match.\n\nWhile his 2025 role fluctuated, his body of work from 2022–2024 tells a different story, when he earned a 90.1 PFF grade with elite marks against both the run and the pass. He has logged extensive snaps in the box, slot, and deep safety roles.\n\nAt 30, Peppers represents a high-upside signing if Detroit believes he can return to form in a more defined role.\n\nThompson has been a steady presence in Arizona’s secondary for five seasons.\n\nHe is one of the most reliable tacklers at the position, with a missed tackle rate of just 6.3% over the past two seasons. His coverage also improved in 2025, allowing a passer rating under 100 while breaking up five passes.\n\nThompson has never finished a season below a 64.0 PFF grade and would offer Detroit consistency and physicality.\n\nBryant has flown under the radar on one of the league’s best defenses.\n\nOver the past two seasons, he has produced a 72.7 PFF overall grade and has been especially effective against the run, earning an 80.9 run-defense grade since 2024. While not flashy, Bryant offers dependable depth and physical play.\n\nBlankenship’s 2025 season was a step backward, particularly in coverage, where he posted a 29.9 PFF grade and allowed a 116.8 passer rating when targeted.\n\nThat said, he remains a strong run defender and was a key contributor during Philadelphia’s 2024 Super Bowl run. At just 26 years old, Blankenship could be a bounce-back candidate in the right environment.\n\nHawkins may be the most underrated safety on the list.\n\nIn 2025, he ranked sixth among qualifying safeties with an 81.3 PFF grade, finishing second in run defense and seventh in coverage. At 28, Hawkins is squarely in his prime and could command significant interest across the league.\n\nDetroit would be adding a true three-down safety with momentum trending upward.\n\nBrisker is an intriguing reclamation option.\n\nWhile 2025 was his lowest-graded season, his first two years in the league showed his ability to play all over the defensive backfield. He’ll be just 27 in 2026 and still offers upside if he can return to earlier form.\n\nWashington’s 2025 season was derailed by an Achilles injury, but his 2024 performance cannot be ignored.\n\nThat year, he ranked fifth among safeties in coverage with an 86.1 PFF grade and showed the ability to play slot, box, and deep roles. His size (5-foot-8) limits him in some matchups, but his versatility fits Detroit’s defensive philosophy.\n\nGilman has quietly developed into a reliable starter.\n\nAfter being traded midseason, he finished 2025 with a solid 70.4 PFF grade. He brings experience, steadiness, and the ability to function in multiple safety alignments — a valuable trait given Detroit’s injury concerns.\n\nCross had a down year at the worst possible time, but the upside remains.\n\nHe ranked 28th among safeties in 2024 and doesn’t turn 25 until the start of the 2026 season. If Detroit believes the dip was situational, Cross could be a younger, affordable option with growth potential.\n\nCisco’s 2025 season ended early due to injury, but his body of work remains solid.\n\nHe has earned PFF grades above 60.0 in every season and will be just 26 in 2026. Cisco offers experience as a full-time starter and could rebound in a healthier situation.\n\nClark quietly enjoyed a bounce-back year in 2025.\n\nSplitting time between strong and free safety, he posted a 74.6 PFF grade and an excellent 86.5 run-defense grade. While coverage remains somewhat inconsistent, Clark brings toughness and versatility that Detroit values.\n\nBrian Branch’s Achilles recovery requires caution, and Kerby Joseph’s lingering injury adds uncertainty. Relying solely on internal options would be risky — especially for a defense built on safety versatility.\n\nDetroit doesn’t need panic moves, but it does need insulation, depth, and experience.\n\nThe Lions have no shortage of options at safety — from high-end starters like Kamren Curl and Jaylinn Hawkins to value veterans like Kevin Byard and Chuck Clark, and upside plays like Brisker and Cross.\n\nGiven the injury context, adding at least one veteran — and possibly two — feels inevitable.\n\nThe post 13 Free Agent Safeties the Detroit Lions MUST Consider appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "The Super Bowl team's logo originates with a First Nations tribe in Canada.",
    "fullText": "Wallace Nagedzi Watts had been going to Seahawks games for almost three decades when a historical discovery helped supercharge his fandom - and deepened his connection to his indigenous roots.\n\n\"It kind of changed my whole life,\" says Watts, a prominent fan of the American football team who goes by the name Captain Seahawk.\n\n\"Because of the Seattle Seahawks I started getting back into my culture.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC while driving down to attend the Super Bowl game in Santa Clara, California, where the Seahawks are due to take on the New England Patriots, Watts says \"it's been my life's mission for the last 12 years to notify everyone that the Seahawks logo was copied from the Kwakwaka'wakw tribe on Vancouver Island\".\n\nThe discovery was made during the Seahawks last Super Bowl sting - coincidentally also against the Patriots - in 2014.\n\nAmid city-wide excitement, the Burke Museum in Seattle decided to investigate the origins of the Seahawks logo, which was chosen by the team's manager in the mid-1970s. A black-and-white photo of a ceremonial mask in an old art book revealed the inspiration behind the design, which was then traced to a collection at the Hudson Museum in Maine.\n\nThe museum sent the mask to Seattle on loan, where a ceremony was held featuring both tribal members and team representatives.\n\nThe mask, which was created in the late 1800s and was carved from cedar, had been in private collections since leaving Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it was created by members of the Kwakwaka'wakw Nation, says Katie Bunn-Marcuse, the curator of Northwest Native Art at the Burke Museum.\n\nThe carving, which is known as a \"transformational mask\" and depicts the ancestral origins of one's family, was created around the time that Canada introduced a ban on many indigenous practices, in a move which decimated many tribes in western Canada.\n\nUsing the mask for its intended purpose, at large gatherings called potlaches, became a crime. Many people went to jail for their cultural practices, however, the Kwakwaka'wakw people continued to hold underground potlaches.\n\n\"The Indian Act banned people gathering and performing their songs,\" says Bunn-Marcuse, adding, that \"the potlatch was the economic and legal system of the coast\". The ban was lifted in 1951, and in 2015 Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that it was part of a \"cultural genocide\", which also included the notorious residential school programme, which separated families and erased local languages.\n\nWatts grew up on a reservation in Port Alberni on the west side of Vancouver Island, in his father's tribal community. But after the discovery of the logo's Kwakwaka'wakw origins, he decided to look into his mother's family history on the other side of the island.\n\nTravelling back to Vancouver Island, he set out on a series of tribal canoe journeys, where he reconnected with Kwakwaka'wakw family members and learned more about their cultural practices.\n\nDuring one trip, he was invited to take place in a ritual in which he was declared a \"warrior\", or guardian of the tribe's culture.\n\n\"I had to dance half-naked in front of a thousand people, and then I came back in warriors clothing. To me it's like being baptised as a Christian. It really changed my life.\"\n\nBruce Alfred, an artist living in Alert Bay, British Columbia, recalls when his cousin started showing up, inspired by his commitment to the Seahawks and his cultural heritage. He says that Watts is not the only person who has been inspired by the NFL team to look into their family history.\n\nAlfred was part of the Burke team that surveyed the mask, and confirmed that it was indeed Kwakwaka'wakw, and had been used in spiritual ceremonies before going into a private collection.\n\n\"After the potlatch ban they took everything away from our people,\" he says, adding that the goal of the government and missionaries was to \"annihilate and assimilate us - either one\".\n\nThe Seahawks are popular throughout Canada's western coast, where no other NFL team exists. Alfred says that many people in his village are Seahawks supporters, and that more people have been inspired to look into their heritage after discovering the team's connection. It comes amid a larger tribal movement to reconnect with the past.\n\n\"There is a resurgence of our people that are stepping up and they're learning the language, the culture, their own identity,\" he says.\n\nAlfred, and other indigenous people who spoke to the BBC, say that unlike other major league sports teams, the Seahawks logo has not sparked backlash because it respectfully borrows from indigenous culture, rather than plays in to racist stereotypes.\n\nThe display of indigenous cultural materials as artworks has been criticised by some tribal people, who see these as sacred tools for worship.\n\nAt the Kwakwaka'wakw exhibit at the University of British Columbia's Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver, one mask is kept under a sheet to symbolically show how some believe these objects should not be displayed, and only taken out for important occasions.\n\nThe debate is always ongoing for museums that display indigenous relics, says Bunn-Marcuse.\n\n\"In community, many of these masks are not brought out until the moment that they are needed,\" she says.\n\n\"Whenever we do our exhibits we do them collaboratively with input and advising by community members. So there are some masks that we no longer show because community has said those are not appropriate to be shown ever outside of their ceremonial context.\"\n\nOthers have critiqued the artwork for originating from a tribe that is hundreds of miles from Seattle, halfway to Alaska. The artwork of local peoples such as the Coast Salish could be used instead, they argue.\n\nQwalsius-Shaun Peterson, a Coast Salish artist from the Puyallup Tribe near Tacoma, Washington, is among many indigenous artists who have redesigned unofficial Seahawks logos in the style of their own local culture.\n\n\"People within the tribal communities are just really excited about native iconography of any kind,\" he says.\n\n\"Nobody takes offense\" to the official logo, he adds, adding that it is not a \"misrepresentation\" and instead \"borrows from\" indigenous art.\n\nWatts, who proudly boasts that he's the first person to arrive at games and the last to leave, is using his celebrity status as a superfan to fund raise for multiple charities.\n\nHe also cooks at a food bank, and mentors Native American youths in prison.\n\n\"I really had a different outlook on my entire life\" after connecting with the roots of the logo, Watts says.\n\n\"We're supposed to be the guardians of our tribe. We protect and provide.\"\n\nTotem pole to return to dockland home\n\nAn underwater mystery on Canada's coast\n\nA surprising way of showing gratitude",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers superstar pitcher Blake Snell made a bold Super Bowl prediction during last week’s Fan Fest before the big game.\n\nIn an interview with the SportsNet LA TV crew, the Seattle native predicted that the Seahawks would win big over the New England Patriots.\n\nSnell predicted the Seahawks would beat the Patriots by 17 points.\n\nBlake Snell predicts the Seahawks are going to beat the Patriots by 17 in the Super Bowl ?\n\n?: @SportsNetLA pic.twitter.com/I3X9iK7hOP\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) February 2, 2026\n\nThe 33-year-old was born and raised in Seattle and attended Shorewood High School in Shoreline, Washington. Snell made a name for himself in the Pacific Northwest before he was selected in the first round of the 2011 MLB Draft.\n\nThe All-Star pitcher grew up a Seattle Mariners fan and said that he will always have love for his hometown. In addition, Snell added that he will attend the Super Bowl, which is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 7 at 3:30 PM PT. The game will be held in Santa Clara, California, at Levi’s Stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe southpaw will now enter his second season in Los Angeles after he signed a five-year, $182 million contract. His deal includes a $52 million signing bonus and a conditional $10 million option for 2030.\n\nSnell touched on a handful of different topics at Fan Fest, including his availability at the start of the 2026 season. He shared with the media that the “plan” is to be ready for Opening Day.\n\n“I’ve been playing catch, been throwing. It feels good,” Snell said. “But I’m just going to take my time. Last year, I was rushing. I wanted to pitch so bad. But I’m going to take my time. The goal is to be ready Opening Day, but I’m going to take my time. I’ll know more once I’m [at Spring Training], throwing bullpens, pitching in games.”\n\nThe two-time Cy Young winner pitched an incredible 2.35 ERA in 2025, but was limited to only 11 starts due to left shoulder inflammation that kept him out for most of the season. Still, Snell played a pivotal role for the Dodgers in their quest for back-to-back titles.\n\nHe will do the same for L.A. in the 2026 season as they seek to become the first National League team to complete a three-peat.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's hard to even remember a time when LeBron James wasn't in the NBA.\n\nThe King has played for more than two decades between the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers, but he really did play basketball before he was in the league, too.\n\nThere's a viral clip going around social media of James hooping when he was just 12 years old.\n\nMORE: Giannis Antetokounmpo's legacy doesn't change despite messy trade rumors\n\nMaybe the coolest part is just how special a passer James already was at that age. It's an ability that has almost seemed innate in him, and clearly, it has been, because it showed up before he was even a teenager.\n\nRare footage of 12 year old LeBron at the 1997 YBOA Championship game 👑 pic.twitter.com/otgDvCVcYi\n\n— LeBron Factory (@LeBronFactory) February 7, 2026\n\nMORE: 'Worst shooting form of all time' draws comparisons to Lonzo Ball, Shawn Marion\n\nIt looks like LeBron still has to hit another growth spurt there, but it's clear he's in control in every spot on the floor.\n\nA couple of his shots are pretty unconventional, but as the best player on the floor, you can fling some things up there and make them anyway.\n\nJames went on to be a storied high school player at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio.\n\nIn his day, players didn't have to go to college, so James was the No. 1 overall pick by the nearby Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nMORE: This NBA Dunk Contest field is one of the worst ever\n\nBut yeah, there are some hoopers out there who can say they played against the King before he had fully gotten his crown.\n\nIt's so cool that these highlights exist, because they're quite the look into the past to see what LeBron was like before the whole world knew his name.\n\nMavericks are Cooper Flagg's team now, no questions asked\n\nReggie Miller made the weirdest NBA player comparison for Caitlin Clark\n\nWhy the Cavs had to trade for James Harden\n\nCavs' Nae'Qwan Tomlin didn't even play high school basketball\n\nCharles Barkley rips NBC and Michael Jordan",

    "fullText": "The early round talent in the 2026 NFL draft seems to align fairly well with where the Jacksonville Jaguars' greatest needs are.\n\nJordan Reid of ESPN recently put together his top 50 prospects big board, with a number of the players represented playing positions that should be on GM James Gladstone's radar this offseason.\n\nAs we look at the current state of the Jaguars' roster, this looks like it could be an offseason where GM James Gladstone invests fairly heavily into the defensive side of the ball.\n\nCornerback is a need with Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome both free agents. Defensive end and defensive tackle depth are needs -- not to mention that the Jaguars could use more pass rush juice from the interior.\n\nThen, depending on whether or not Devin Lloyd returns, that will determine how big of a need linebacker is.\n\nOn offense, adding to the offensive line and tight end positions could be on Gladstone's radar. Depth at most positions is always welcomed as well.\n\nAfter trading up for Travis Hunter in last year's draft, the Jaguars do not own their first-round pick this year. However, these rankings help us identify the strengths of this year's draft class.\n\nBelow is a positional breakdown of how Reid's top 50 big board shook out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: 2026 NFL draft: How latest big board aligns with Jaguars needs",

    "description": "Shaheed uses his speed to make big plays for the Seahawks. The former Weber State star could use it to bring home a Super Bowl ring.",
    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Rashid Shaheed is a perfect example of someone who takes advantage of their opportunities.\n\nWhen he was a little-recruited return specialist with track speed from the San Diego area coming out of high school, Shaheed ended up at Weber State under head coach Jay Hill and became a four-time All-American as a return specialist and receiving weapon.\n\nWhen he entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent — and was coming off an ACL injury that prevented him from working out in the pre-draft process — the New Orleans Saints saw Shaheed’s potential and signed him to a deal.\n\nHe turned that into a productive three-and-a-half years with the franchise.\n\nWhen the Saints traded him midseason during the 2025 campaign to the Seattle Seahawks, Shaheed adjusted again — and while he’s not as prominent in the Seahawks’ passing game as he was in New Orleans, Shaheed has made big plays in Seattle on special teams.\n\nSeveral of those plays have been important to the Seahawks’ postseason run.\n\nAnd now, he’s headed to Super Bowl LX with Seattle, where the Seahawks will face the New England Patriots on Sunday (4:30 p.m. MST, NBC) at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nWhat will Shaheed do with that opportunity?\n\n“I feel like the journey has shaped me to be not only the player, but the person that I am today,” Shaheed told the Deseret News in an exclusive interview ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\n“Obviously, coming in from an FCS school, Weber State, coming into the league with an injury, not knowing if I’m going to get the opportunity eventually, I just made the most of my opportunities, and that’s all I’ve done up to this point.”\n\nShaheed’s NFL career started modestly enough, as an under-the-radar addition during the 2022 offseason.\n\nIt didn’t take long for New Orleans to fall in love with the 6-foot, speedy Shaheed, though.\n\nDespite coming off an ACL injury, he ended up with 34 receptions for 488 yards and two touchdowns as a rookie.\n\nHis best receiving season thus far came in 2023, when he caught 75 passes for 719 yards and five touchdowns. He also earned Pro Bowl honors for the first time that season as a return specialist.\n\nA meniscus injury suffered in Week 6 of the 2024 season sidelined him the rest of that year, one where he was on pace to break his career numbers from that 2023 season.\n\nThen this year, there was a midseason trade from New Orleans to Seattle.\n\n“That’s an organization that gave me the opportunity to live out my dreams,” Shaheed said of the Saints franchise. “They treated me with so much respect, not only me, but my family — made us feel at home, made us feel welcome, and that just allowed me to go out there and just have fun and play the game that I love.\n\n“Obviously, I loved my time in New Orleans and I can’t thank the organization enough.”\n\nThe trade brought up a flood of emotions for Shaheed, who had 2,055 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns with the Saints, though he went in confident he would make an impact with his new team.\n\n“It was a lot, obviously, my first time being traded, being a new team, new city, organization,” Shaheed said.\n\n“... I knew that I’d be able to get a grasp of the offensive game quickly. The transition has been smooth, and I appreciate my coaches and my teammates.”\n\nThere was a familiar face for Shaheed when he landed in Seattle: Klink Kubiak, the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, who held the same role in New Orleans during the 2023 season.\n\nKubiak is the reported choice to take over as the Las Vegas Raiders’ next head coach.\n\nHaving Kubiak in Seattle, though, helped the transition for Shaheed. He’s impressed with how tough the Seahawks play, week in and week out.\n\n“Every man plays for the guy next to him, and that’s the recipe for winning, not only on offense, but defense and special teams. We all take pride in what we do and have fun doing it.”\n\n“Every man plays for the guy next to him, and that’s the recipe for winning, not only on offense, but defense and special teams. We all take pride in what we do and have fun doing it,” Shaheed said.\n\nWhile Shaheed’s biggest impacts in Seattle have come on special teams, he still had 15 receptions for 188 yards during the regular season.\n\nHe’s joined a wide receiver group that includes veteran Cooper Kupp, another FCS product who played at Eastern Washington, and shifty Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who was named The Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year earlier this week.\n\n“With those guys, man, I just kind of sit back and watch them work,” Shaheed said.\n\nHaving the ninth-year pro Kupp, who earned a Super Bowl ring with the Los Angeles Rams, is “like having another coach” for Shaheed on the field and in the film room.\n\n“He knows what’s going to happen. He teaches us, me and Jax, what to look for in film, guys’ tendencies, all that,” Shaheed said. “I’m learning a lot from him.”\n\nShaheed has been impressed with the work ethic and approach that Smith-Njigba, the third-year pro, brings to the field every day.\n\n“Jaxon man, just the way he works, the way he shows up every day with a smile on his face and just the teammate that he is,” Shaheed said, of what stands out about the receiver who led the NFL in receiving yards (1,793) this season.\n\n“He’s gonna go out there and compete. It’s been a real pleasure working with these guys.”\n\nIt’s little surprise that Shaheed was one of the more popular interviews during Super Bowl media opportunities at the San Jose Convention Center this week — his big-play ability gets him noticed.\n\nSince arriving in Seattle, he’s produced multiple momentum-changing moments, and that popularity extends over to the Seahawks fanbase.\n\nHe’s scored three touchdowns on special teams, giving him five for his career. That earned Shaheed his second Pro Bowl citation.\n\nIt started with a 100-yard kick return for a touchdown in Week 14, when he took the second-half kick back for six points against Atlanta to break a 6-6 tie in an eventual 37-9 Seahawks win.\n\nShaheed kept upping the ante with his ensuing big returns.\n\nDuring a Week 16 matchup against the Rams, a critical game in terms of NFC seeding, the Seahawks trailed 30-14 midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nIn front of the electric Lumen Field home crowd, Shaheed changed the complexion of the game with a 58-yard punt return for a touchdown with 8:03 to play.\n\nSeattle forced overtime, then won 38-37 in the extra session in a game that helped the Seahawks earn the NFC’s top seed and home-field advantage in the playoffs.\n\nThen, in the divisional round with NFC West rival San Francisco coming to town, Shaheed started off the playoff contest with another electric play. His 95-yard touchdown on the game’s opening kickoff sparked a 41-6 win over the 49ers.\n\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED?! @RashidShaheed on the opening play 🤯\n\n📺: @NFLonFox pic.twitter.com/ZzMrFLI9l9\n\n— xz* - Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) January 18, 2026\n\n“I know the opportunities are going to come. My coaches believe in me to make those types of plays, and that just allows me to go out there and play free, play fast and just do what I’ve been coached to do,” Shaheed said.\n\n“(It’s a) big testament to the coaches for just allowing me to go out there and allow my ability to (make plays).”\n\nDuring Seattle’s postseason run, Shaheed has three kickoff returns for 147 yards (a 49-yard average), a 51-yard catch and three carries for 27 yards.\n\nThat 51-yard reception set up Seattle’s opening touchdown in the Seahawks’ 31-27 win over the Rams in the NFC championship game.\n\nHe’ll have opportunities to again make big plays in Sunday’s Super Bowl. In 59 previous Super Bowls, there have been 10 kickoff returns for touchdowns, but no one has ever returned a punt for a touchdown.\n\nFor Shaheed, the key Sunday against the Patriots is sticking together as a team.\n\n“Obviously, the magnitude is much, much bigger, but as long as we continue to do what we have all season, that’s just stick together, play all four quarters, we know that a team has to play us all four quarters, and we don’t believe that they can play with our style,” Shaheed said.\n\n“That’s with a lot of passion, aggression on a lot of big plays. We enjoy what we do, and it’s gonna be a fun game.”\n\nNo matter how Super Bowl LX ends up, Shaheed will represent Weber State in a positive way.\n\nHe credits his time with the Wildcats for helping him develop as a wide receiver and becoming a well-respected (and feared) return specialist.\n\n“That’s where I developed my game. Like I said, I had great coaches to learn from, great schemes. Obviously, I was able to make a lot of plays in the return game, but I grew so much as a wide receiver, and that was just taking a lot of time, spending time on my craft,” Shaheed said.\n\n“Being at a small school, it allowed me to work on that even more with limited distractions, small city. All it was was just work and continue to get better. And that’s how I’ve been able to progress.”\n\nShaheed is joining an elite group of Weber State alums who’ve reached the Super Bowl.\n\nThere are six former Wildcats who’ve won a Super Bowl ring, a list that includes Lee White, Darryl Pollard, Jamie Martin, Marcus Mailei, Paul McQuistan and Jonah Williams.\n\nShaheed will be only the fourth former Weber State player, though, to actually play in the Super Bowl. That more exclusive list includes Pollard, who started for the 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV, Al Pupunu and McQuistan.\n\nIt means a lot for Shaheed to represent his alma mater, and a victory Sunday would just make it sweeter.\n\n“I think that moment would just be bigger than just me,” he said about the possibility of earning a Super Bowl ring. “That would be an opportunity to let kids know that you can make it from anywhere. You don’t have to go to a Power Five school. You can go to an FCS school and make it happen.\n\n“And as long as you play the game the right way, teams will find you. Don’t be afraid to take that risk and just go anywhere you get an opportunity to play football and do what you love. Pursue it.”",

    "fullText": "Everyone accepts that golf etiquette may not be as strict at the WM Phoenix Open as it might be elsewhere, and that's ok with most people.\n\nThe constant buzz of the crowd and the eruption of noise after every tee shot at the 16th hole, for example, replaces the normal near-silence found on many golf holes around the world.

    "description": "An NFL insider has named the Detroit Lions as a serious trade contender for Raiders star Maxx Crosby. Here’s why the fit makes sense.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions just got pulled into one of the biggest trade rumors of the entire offseason.\n\nDuring Super Bowl LX week, NFL insider Jeremy Fowler of ESPN named the Lions as one of several “natural would-be contenders” to pursue Raiders star defensive end Maxx Crosby, a revelation that immediately caught the attention of fans across the league.\n\nThe timing isn’t accidental. Earlier in the week, Fox Sports insider Jay Glazer reported that Crosby may be “done” with Las Vegas, setting off widespread speculation about where one of the NFL’s most relentless pass rushers could land next.\n\nDetroit is firmly in win-now mode, and the idea of pairing Crosby with Aidan Hutchinson is the kind of move that could change the balance of power in the NFC.\n\nCrosby has been one of the league’s most consistent edge defenders over the last seven seasons, earning two All-Pro selections and five Pro Bowl nods. Adding him opposite Hutchinson would give the Lions one of the most feared pass-rush duos in football — something this defense has lacked in high-leverage playoff moments.\n\nAccording to Fowler, Crosby’s priority is clear:\n\n“What has been made clear to me: Crosby wants to be a part of a winner. That’s the priority.”\n\nThat alone puts Detroit squarely in the conversation.\n\nFowler reported that trade interest in Crosby is massive, with more than a dozen teams expected to at least inquire. Among the contenders he specifically listed were the Bills, Lions, 49ers, Cowboys, and Ravens — a group made up almost entirely of Super Bowl-caliber teams.\n\nCrosby has remained loyal to the Raiders throughout his career, but Fowler noted that loyalty could soon be tested. Las Vegas is still far from contention, and Crosby is approaching the heart of his prime.\n\nAny Crosby trade would come at a steep cost — both in draft capital and money.\n\nIf Detroit were to acquire him, Crosby would carry a 2026 cap hit north of $30 million, though he does come with four years of team control after signing a three-year, $106.5 million extension last offseason.\n\nThat number is significant, but for a franchise pushing for its first Super Bowl appearance, it’s the type of financial swing that front offices sometimes decide is worth it.\n\nStatistically, Crosby is exactly what Detroit would be buying:\n\nProven durability and leadership\n\nThe Lions already have their defensive cornerstone in Hutchinson. What they don’t yet have is the elite second edge rusher who forces quarterbacks to pick their poison.\n\nThat’s why the Crosby rumors won’t die anytime soon.\n\nWhether Detroit actually pulls the trigger is another question — but according to ESPN, the Lions are very much in the mix.\n\nThe post NFL Insider Links Detroit Lions to Maxx Crosby appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

Dimitrijevic capped off the game with a strikeout, pushing the ‘Noles to 3-0 on the weekend.\n\nMarlee Gaskell made her Seminole debut, and led off with a strikeout.

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Senada Greca, founder of WeRise and cofounder of Aonic. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAt least four times a week, I meet with Kim Kardashian for a personal training session. Today, we're focused on the upper body and core. Over our hour-and-a-half session, we'll do assisted pull-ups, hollow-body chest presses, face-pulls, and more. Kim likes to end most training sessions with a dead hang on the bar.\n\nI've been training Kim for three years now. I also help millions of other people (mostly women) through my training platform WeRise, and the fitness and nutrition videos I post on social media.\n\nStrength training is powerful, especially for women. Once you know the strength your body possesses, you'll understand how to feel good in your body, rather than feeling like you need to shrink or punish it. I know, because that's a change I've made myself.\n\nI'm the oldest of three girls, born in Albania. After the communist government was overthrown in the early 1990s, there was a lot of civil unrest. I remember the first time we heard gunshots. We hid under the bed, staying down for a long time.\n\nLuckily, my family won the green card lottery (Editor's note: The green card lottery is formally called the Diversity Visa Program, which provides up to 55,000 visas through random selection.), and we were able to immigrate to America in 1997 when I was 14. That helped set up a safer, more prosperous future for my sisters and me.\n\nAt the time, it was very challenging. I spoke with a heavy accent and dressed differently from my classmates in upstate New York, which led to a lot of bullying. Since I was the only one in the family who spoke English, I had to help my parents with legal documents, doctors' appointments, and getting my sisters into school. It was a lot.\n\nEverything in my life felt out of control. The one thing I could control was my eating, and not long after immigrating, I developed anorexia. Within a few years, I was also struggling with depression and anxiety. I was exercising, but only to punish my body.\n\nIn college, I connected with counseling and medication that helped me start getting healthy. The real turning point came when I was in my mid-20s and met a new primary care doctor. She was in her 50s, but running marathons every quarter. She taught me to think about exercise as a way to support mental health. I started running and became more physically and mentally stable.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, in my mid-30s, I started strength training. It changed my life, as I started using exercise to nourish myself.\n\nIn my immigrant family, financial security was always very important. I had a corporate job, and had never considered building something on my own — it just wasn't done.\n\nI started teaching yoga at night, and loved how my classes made people feel. In 2019, I began posting videos of my workouts, at first for myself. I was extremely consistent, which helped me grow a big following. When the pandemic happened, my following grew exponentially as people looked for workouts they could do at home.\n\nIn 2020, I launched my website and began charging for memberships. I quickly saw that my fitness business could be stable and successful. That gave me the courage to quit my corporate job to follow my passion. In the years since, my audience has only grown, and I've had amazing opportunities, like training Kim.\n\nToday, I'm in the best shape of my life — physically and mentally — at 43. I don't often talk about my age, because I feel ageless and don't want to define myself by a number. At the same time, I want to show that getting older doesn't have to mean winding down.",

    "description": "An anti-aging researcher went to Italy's longevity Blue Zone, and learned the best way to exercise for a longer, healthier life.",
    "fullText": "Steven Austad is a gym fanatic.\n\nAs the director of an anti-aging research nonprofit, he's deeply aware that exercise might be the closest thing we have to a longevity cure-all.\n\nThat's why he puts in about an hour a day on his bike or in the weight room as part of his longevity routine.\n\n\"I don't take any supplements. I don't even take a multivitamin, but I do spend a lot of time in the gym,\" he told Business Insider\n\nBut on a recent research trip, Austad met with centenarians who stayed spry with a completely different style of exercise, and it changed how he thinks about working out.\n\n\"I met all these hundred-year-olds and talked to them and watched them,\" he said. \"They get a lot of exercise, but it's not heavy exercise.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the healthiest kind of movement — and why being a little bit lazy may be the key to a long, healthy life.\n\nSardinia, Italy is one of the few places in the world where people regularly live to be 100 (or even older).\n\nKnown as Blue Zones, residents in these regions have traditions that scientists suspect are linked to enduring good health. Despite being spread around the globe, from Okinawa, Japan to Nicoya, Costa Rica, Blue Zones tend to share lifestyle habits like staying active, eating simple, mostly veggie-based superfoods, and building strong social communities.\n\nAustad traveled to Sardinia last year while working on a research paper about whether longevity hotspots live up to the hype. He wanted to test the theory that the high number of centenarians in Blue Zones is more about poor record-keeping than any exceptional anti-aging habits.\n\nWhat he found is that Sardinian elders are legit. Not only did he verify that residents of the island are active and vibrant into their 90s and 100s, but what he saw changed his own approach to healthy living.\n\nVillages in Sardinia are dotted throughout the region's rugged, mountainous terrain. As a result, people who live there are consistently hiking as part of their day-to-day activities to get around.\n\nCombined with other household chores like gardening, Sardinians tick all the boxes of longevity exercise without ever setting foot in a gym: lots of easy cardio, a bit of high-intensity effort from walking uphill, and muscle-strengthening movements using a full range of motion.\n\nAustad also spoke with a regenerative medicine doctor in the area, who specializes in staving off problems caused by injury or aging.\n\nShe told him that her patients are primarily young people who hurt themselves in the gym.\n\nAustad was stunned. All the 90- and 100-year-olds he had met were vibrant and healthy, while the younger generations needed medical care for pushing themselves too hard.\n\n\"That's just remarkable,\" Austad said. \"It convinced me that you don't have to be fanatical about this stuff.\"\n\nComing back from his Italian excursion, Austad couldn't help but rethink his own approach to exercise.\n\nPreviously, he liked hit the gym hard, leaning into the addictive rush of endorphins from intense exercise, and was constantly tempted to push for an extra set or more time working out. For him, rest days felt like a distraction.\n\n\"The occasional day off, it drives me nuts,\" he said. \"I've got this one bad knee, and if I overdo it with that knee, I pay the price. So that kind of keeps me real, tells me when I'm starting to overdo it.\"\n\nAustad still hits the gym regularly, with a mix of cardio and strength training that prioritizes core stability and everyday motions like pulling and pressing.\n\nBut since his recent studies on the Blue Zones, he said he's more likely to give himself a break without stressing about it.\n\n\"It makes me feel a little bit less guilty on the days when I decide that I shouldn't work out,\" Austad said.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mesha Griffith, the author of The Bedtime Mantra. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a children's book author and mom. One day, I looked around the house and said, \"We have too much stuff.\"\n\nI got the idea to declutter for 30 days and get rid of 496 items from The Minimalists podcast. You have to get rid of one thing on the first day, two on the second day, three on the third, and so on.\n\nWe started it in 2021. My husband and I, along with some extended family, would do a group text at the beginning of the year and say, \"Here's what I'm going to get rid of,\" and send pictures back and forth to hold each other accountable.\n\nI decided to share the challenge with my Instagram followers. I posted my first decluttering challenge in January 2025, and then I did the second one in December 2025. Someone said I should draw a random number every day for the December challenge, and I had to purge however many items the number said, which turned out to be the perfect way to gamify it — and to hold myself accountable to post consistently on social media.\n\nAll of our stuff was once money, and I just started seeing everything as dollar signs. One day, I added everything up I was getting rid of that day and how much I originally spent on it, and it was $400.\n\nI'm more aware of the things I'm buying and bringing into my house, but even we have clutter. For example, we collect so much paper. I threw away three expired insurance cards. I threw away instruction manuals. You can find the PDFs online.\n\nEvery day since this went viral with my decluttering videos, I have had people waiting to see what number I'd pull the next day. I didn't want to let those people down. People even began doing their own challenge alongside me. It was more exciting to me that other people were inspired by my little challenge.\n\nIn the beginning, I'd get a lot of comments asking me whether I'd count this or that item, or how many items something like a Tupperware with a lid counted for.\n\nI'd tell them not to focus on that — it counts because it's causing you anxiety, stress, or agitation.\n\nThrowing stuff away was never an option. I had time, energy, and mental capacity to try to find new homes for as much stuff as I could.\n\nI'd resell on Facebook Marketplace, but it would need to go quickly. I didn't want to have a box of unsold stuff at the end of the month. If it didn't sell quickly, I'd take it to the thrift store, the free pantry, or other places. For example, I took towels, sheets, and blankets to the Columbus Humane Society, and I took building supplies and working appliances to Habitat for Humanity's ReStore.\n\nI don't think I'll do any more decluttering challenges for myself this year. I feel like I've run out of things to get rid of, but I would love to help either a family member or a friend declutter their home.",

He succeeded Shaun Maloney, but the former Preston North End, Plymouth Argyle and Bury boss won just 12 out of his 49 games in charge.\n\nPeterborough hit struggling Wigan for six\n\nWigan said Glenn Whelan and Graham Barrow will take charge of the first team on an interim basis while the club \"will work quickly to identify and appoint\" a new head coach.\n\nThe club also thanked Lowe for \"his efforts and wishes him all the best for the future\".\n\nLowe previously won promotion from League Two with Bury and Plymouth and finished 13th, 12th and 10th in the Championship with Preston.\n\nHaving arrived at the club at the tail end of the 2024-25 season, Lowe guided Wigan to a 15th-placed finish in the table.\n\nAfter winning against Northampton on the opening day of this season, Wigan's form soon tailed off as they secured just three victories from 17 matches in all competitions between late August and late November.\n\nWigan's next match is at home in the league against Reading on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before they travel to face Premier League leaders Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday, 15 February (16:30).",

    "fullText": "Tries: Arundell (3), Earl, Roebuck, penalty try, Freeman Cons: Ford (4) Pens: Ford\n\nA remorseless England piled pain and points on Wales as they began their hunt for the Six Nations title with a 48-7 victory at Allianz Stadium.\n\nWing Henry Arundell, making his first start for his country in more than two years, scored a first-half hat-trick as England put themselves out of sight before the break.\n\nJosh Adams was picked out by Dan Edwards' precise punt for Wales's solitary try five minutes after the restart, but, for the most part, the one-way traffic continued to steamroll the visitors.\n\nTom Roebuck added to Ben Earl's first-half try, before the introduction of Marcus Smith, Henry Pollock and returning captain Maro Itoje energised England for the final quarter.\n\nEarl, as he did in the 68-14 romp in Cardiff last year, switched to midfield late on as England used the remaining game time to try out new patterns for the campaign to come.\n\nTommy Freeman, who scored in all five of England's games in the tournament last year, powered his way over in the last play of the game to keep that scoring streak going.\n\nWales have now won only two of their past 24 Test matches, while the domestic game is racked with uncertainty and rancour as the Welsh Rugby Union attempt to restructure four regional sides.\n\nOminously they take on France, the defending champions who took apart Ireland on Thursday night, next weekend.\n\nThe contrast to England is stark. The hosts' 12th straight victory was roared to the rafters and belief is swelling that their run can carry them to a first title since 2020.\n\nA far tougher test of those credentials awaits in the shape of a wounded Scotland in Edinburgh next weekend, but their mix of accurate attack and furious defence was hard to fault.\n\nIt was certainly too potent for Wales.\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nRugby Union Weekly: 'Ruthless' England thrash Wales\n\nWe let ourselves and people at home down - Lake\n\nEngland coach Steve Borthwick had forecast a barrage of high kicks from Wales and, with the Twickenham surface slick after heavy morning rain, he was soon proved right.\n\nWales scrum-half Tomos Williams hoisted the first box-kick after 40 seconds and Ellis Mee's chase of another sky-scraping boot earned Wales some prime field position.\n\nEngland were not averse to taking the same route, with George Ford testing Louis Rees-Zammit with a pair of spiral bombs early on.\n\nIt was soon clear though that only England had the urgency, intensity and power to capitalise from the chaos that followed.\n\nAfter George Ford's third-minute penalty, a first England try followed as Guy Pepper led the heavy brigade into contact and Ford zipped the ball wide for Arundell to stroll in.\n\nShipping points at the rate of one a minute, Wales's faint hopes were then torpedoed by two yellow cards in the space of 60 seconds.\n\nNicky Smith and fellow front-rower Dewi Lake were dispatched to the sin bin in quick succession as they illegally went after England at a line-out close to their line.\n\nUnderstaffed and underpowered, England picked Wales off.\n\nGiven the option of a penalty in the shadow of the posts to restart, captain Jamie George called for a scrum to the glee of the Allianz Stadium crowd.\n\nThe set-piece monstering duly followed, opening space for Ford to casually punt the ball wide for Arundell for his second. Ben Earl then bullocked over out wide as England made the most of their powerplay against 13 men.\n\nWales were restored to their full complement at 22-0 down, but they rarely managed to wrestle momentum their way.\n\nEngland's fourth try – Arundell's third – was largely self-inflicted as Dan Edwards lobbed a pass behind Rees-Zammit, allowing Dingwall to scoop up and feed Arundell.\n\nThe Bath wing had touched the ball only three times, and scored on each occasion, recording the team's first Six Nations hat trick since Jonny May against France in 2019.\n\nWith the contest all but over at 29-0 at half-time, both coaches will have spent the second half taking notes for weeks to come.\n\nThe experiment of running Freeman in midfield was a partial success for England. The Northampton man made more metres than any other England player as he hunted the ball and found space, although at least one chance went begging as he failed to release a galloping Roebuck outside.\n\nRichard Wigglesworth, now overseeing England's defence, will have relished how his side stubbornly shut out Wales, flying into tackles and defending their line as a source of pride.\n\nSteve Tandy's side kept their chins up and the defeat was not on the scale of the Cardiff capitulation last year.\n\nRees-Zammit's switch to full-back worked well as he came through an aerial examination and sliced through open field with strength and speed on one 55th-minute break.\n\nTomos Williams showed his class at scrum-half, while the back-row axis of Alex Mann, Josh MacLeod and Aaron Wainwright scrapped hard at the breakdown.\n\nBut this is a team early in development and short in depth.\n\nEngland unloaded their bench to loud acclaim from most of the 81,953 in attendance and, an almost immediate yellow card for Maro Itoje apart, their energy swamped Wales in the final quarter.\n\nWales have promise, but also much progress to make if they are to close the gap.\n\n'A brilliant start for England' - relive how 'ruthless' England thrashed Wales\n\nEngland: Steward; Roebuck, Freeman, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, George, Heyes; Coles, Chessum; Pepper, Underhill, Earl.\n\nReplacements: Rodd for Genge (43), Cowan-Dickie for George (51), Davison for Heyes (51), Itoje for Coles (51), T Curry for Underhill (51), M Smith for Steward (65), Pollock for Roebuck (65), Spencer for Mitchell (67).\n\nWales: Rees-Zammit; Mee, James, B Thomas, Adams; Edwards, T Williams; Smith, Lake (capt), Griffin, D Jenkins, Beard, Mann, Macleod, Wainwright.\n\nReplacements: Carre for Smith (51), Francis for Griffin (51), Plumtree for Mann (51), Grady for Mee (53), Deaves for Macleod (53), Carter for Beard (70), Hardy for T Williams (79).\n\nSin-bin: Smith (17), Lake (18), B.

    "fullText": "Wales captain Dewi Lake says his side let themselves and the Welsh public down following Saturday's 48-7 Six Nations defeat by England.\n\nLake was one of four visiting players to be shown a yellow card as they were overpowered by Steve Borthwick's side, conceding seven tries.\n\nFormer Wales fly-half Dan Biggar criticised the first-half performance, describing it as \"nowhere near good enough for international rugby\" as Wales were trailing 29-0.\n\n\"We said at the end of the game that we let ourselves down and people at home down,\" said Lake.\n\n\"We spoke all week about what we were going to produce and we didn't do it.\n\n\"There's no other way to say it, there's no point just talking about things.\n\n\"We're massively disappointed with what we put on the field.\"\n\nWales conceded 16 penalties and were twice forced to play with just 13 men.\n\nTen of those penalties came in the first half with prop Nicky Smith and hooker Lake shown yellow cards within a minute of each other.\n\nCentre Ben Thomas and replacement flanker Taine Plumtree were then sent to the sin-bin in the second half.\n\nIt was Plumtree's sixth yellow card of the season and his third sin-binning in three games for Wales.\n\n\"Our discipline in the first 20 minutes was poor,\" said Lake.\n\n\"We were down to 13 men for nearly 20 minutes and against a team like England, that's going to be hard. It's hard to come back from 29-0 down.\"\n\nWales have conceded 65 penalties in Steve Tandy's first five games in charge, with 10 yellow cards and one red card, as the head coach admitted it was becoming a trend.\n\n\"We're hard on ourselves and we've got refereeing teams of three coming in to training,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"It's something you can't run away or hide from.\n\n\"We'll go back, look at it and the reasons why, learn as a group why we feel we're under that type of pressure and giving away those sorts of penalties.\"\n\nArundell scores hat-trick as England heap misery on Wales\n\n'A brilliant start for ruthless England' - reaction after seven-try England thrash Wales\n\nSince the 2023 World Cup, Wales have a wretched international record of 22 defeats in 24 Tests, with the only two victories coming against Japan in 2025.\n\nIt has been 1,064 days since Wales' previous Six Nations victory, against Italy in Rome in March 2023, with this latest hammering a 12th successive loss in the tournament.\n\nWales host favourites France in eight days in Cardiff having not won a home match in the tournament since defeating Scotland in February 2022.\n\nTicket sales are slow for the three home games with thousands still available for the visit of Les Bleus.\n\n\"Every voice matters to us at the minute, every fan that can get behind us,\" said Lake.\n\n\"We know we're going to be better next week. We've spoken a lot about wanting to excite a nation.\n\n\"We didn't do it today but we've got another four games in this tournament.\"\n\nLake says the effort of the squad can not be questioned but admits the quality was not there against England.\n\n\"This group will fight for each other all day,\" said Lake.\n\n\"There's no question of effort. It's not hard to get that out of this group or keep these players going.\n\n\"They love wearing this jersey and want to work hard.\n\n\"That's why this group is special. For us, it's about turning it into accuracy and flipping that into our favour.\"\n\nWelsh players are facing a lot of off-the field issues with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) threatening to cut a professional men's side and Ospreys under threat of disappearing as a top-tier team.\n\nLake was one of four Ospreys' players in the 23-strong match-day line-up with four \n\n\"It's not good enough to use that as an excuse,\" said Lake.\n\n\"There is a space which is open for the boys if they want to discuss it.\n\n\"We have spoken about it as a group but the boys have their heads down wanting to do their best for Wales.\"",

    "fullText": "Usman Nurmagomedov outclassed Alfie Davis before submitting the Briton in the third round to retain his PFL lightweight title in Dubai.\n\nRussia's Nurmagomedov marched Davis down throughout, attacking with an array of kicks, before securing a key takedown midway through the fight and putting him to sleep with an unorthodox arm triangle choke.\n\nThe win extends 27-year-old Nurmagomedov's unbeaten record to 22 fights and marks his fifth world title defence.\n\nDavis, 33, won the PFL's lightweight tournament last year to earn the title shot but was a big underdog in the fight and rarely looked as if he would trouble Nurmagomedov.\n\n\"I won how I planned, I made him tired, I made him work, I made him grapple and the win was going to come,\" said Nurmagomedov.\n\n\"Thank you for my father, he is here with me. Everything I have in this life is from him.\"\n\nDavis came into the fight following his win over Nurmagomedov's team-mate Gadzhi Rabadanov in August and he carried the confidence he earned from that contest into the title bout.\n\nDavis wore a beaming grin as he danced his way to the cage with a swagger, in front of booing fans who were largely in support of Nurmagomedov.\n\nNurmagomedov submits Davis in PFL title fight - reaction\n\nWatching Davis at cage-side was two-time heavyweight boxing world champion Anthony Joshua, who was making one of his first public appearances since taking time away from the spotlight after being involved in a car crash in December.\n\nIn contrast to Davis, Nurmagomedov wore a stern, focused expression as he made his walkout, flanked by coach, cousin and mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and two-division UFC champion Islam Makhachev.\n\nDavis embraced the boos from fans as he was introduced before the fight, who chanted 'Usman Usman' when the contest got under way.\n\nFrom the moment the bell rang, Nurmagomedov stalked Davis, attacking with leg and high kicks, while Davis searched for opportunities to counter.\n\nDavis maintained his confidence in the face of Usman's suffocating presence, jiving and weaving before throwing strikes but failed to land anything of note that hurt the Russian.\n\nNurmagomedov showed his evasiveness and he dodged a spectacular spinning back-kick from Davis, before proving his advantage in the grappling as he secured multiple takedowns.\n\nWith just over half a minute remaining in the third round, Nurmagomedov landed the fight-defining takedown as he took Davis' back before putting him to sleep with an unusual arm triangle-rear-naked choke hybrid.\n\nIn his post-fight interview Nurmagomedov, who is regarded as one of the best fighters outside the UFC, made no mention of possible opponents he would like to face next.\n\nOther than a trilogy fight with Irishman Paul Hughes, who lost on points to Nurmagomedov in two close five-round fights last year, there are no standout contenders.\n\nAnother option for Nurmagomedov could be Rabadanov, but it is rare for fighters who train at the same gym to fight each other.\n\nThe most enticing fight for Davis next is also Hughes, who has not competed since defeat by Nurmagomedov in October.\n\nDavis will not be able to defend his 2025 tournament crown because the PFL is not continuing the format in 2026.\n\nEarlier on the card, Britain's Luke Trainer submitted Australia's Rob Wilkinson in the first round of their light-heavyweight bout via a guillotine choke.\n\nVictory ended a 17-month absence for 29-year-old Trainer as he earned his fifth straight win.\n\nFellow Briton Haider Khan was on the wrong side of a guillotine choke as he suffered a first-round defeat by Brazil's Jhony Gregory in their middleweight bout.\n\nIn the co-main event, Russia's Ramazan Kuramagomedov beat countryman Shamil Musaev on points to win the PFL welterweight title.\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - will not be able to wear their new helmets after the Court of Arbitration for Sport said they do not comply with the sport's rules around shape.",
    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - will not be able to wear their new helmets because they do not comply with the sport's rules around shape.\n\nThe British team had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) on Thursday to overturn the decision by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).\n\nBut Cas say the helmet is a departure from the standard helmet shape and has clearly been designed to specifically enhance aerodynamic performance because the back of the helmet protrudes.\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) stressed that the helmet was designed with safety in mind and to comply with new safety regulations due to be introduced by the IBSF at the start of the 2026-27 season.\n\nThose rules are not in place at the Olympics but British skeleton have essentially tried to get ahead of the curve by designing and using their new helmet in Italy.\n\nInstead they will wear the ones they wore during the last World Cup season.\n\nA picture seen by BBC Sport shows that the helmet is pointed at the back - similar in appearance to a track cycling helmet.\n\nNatalie Dunman, executive performance director at the BBSA, said: \"Based on the strength of the case we put forward, naturally we are disappointed in [the] decision.\n\n\"However, this does not affect our final preparations and nor has the discourse affected the athletes' focus or optimism going into the Games.\n\n\"Our athletes have been winning medals all season, and throughout the Olympic cycle, in their current helmets and we remain in a strong position to continue that trend.\"\n\nWhen asked about the helmet prior to the verdict, Team GB's skeleton racers said they had no preference on which helmet they used at the Olympics.\n\nThey arrive at the Games as heavy favourites to win medals with world champion and overall World Cup winner Matt Weston leading the charge for gold while compatriot Marcus Wyatt is also fancied to go well.\n\nThe British team wore the new helmets at a training session last week in Switzerland with the IBSF ruling them out on 29 January before the BBSA appealed against the ban on Thursday.\n\nOfficial skeleton training in Cortina begins on Monday with the men's event beginning on 12 February, while the women's starts on 13 February and the team event is on 15 February.\n\nThe helmet is the most important bit of kit both for safety and aerodynamics - how quickly the slider can travel down the track.\n\nDoctor Bryce Dyer, a professor of sport technology at the University of Bournemouth, says that because skeleton is head first it is essential that the helmet is aerodynamic to cut through the air.\n\n\"The airflow over that section is really, really important,\" he said. \"Any kind of gain they can make with the shape and the general performance of it, then obviously the higher the speed gap is going to achieve and therefore the better chances of the medal.\n\n\"The funny thing with aerodynamics is that the faster you go, the more resistance actually gets thrown against you. So you need the most aerodynamically efficient shape you can obtain.\"\n\nIt is here that the British team's case appears to have been decided, with Cas agreeing with the IBSF that the overall shape incorporates prohibited spoilers (attachments), protruding edges or aerodynamic elements.\n\n\"Even that [aerodynamic helmet] will only yield a very, very small increase in velocity. But that could be just enough,\" said Dyer.\n\nWith the margin between winning gold and going home empty handed \"hundredths of a second\", two-time world champion Weston knows that innovation in aerodynamics is key to the \"minor gains\" needed.\n\nWhile the BBSA say they are disappointed with the decision, the British team know they are in a strong position without the new helmets.\n\nBetween them, Weston and Wyatt have won all seven World Cup races this season while three women have qualified for the Olympics for the first time in British history.\n\nWhen discussing the matter before the verdict was announced, Wyatt, Weston and women's skeleton rider Tabitha Stoecker all said they did not mind which helmet they wore at the Games.\n\n\"All of our success has been with the other helmet - for me this is the tiniest little thing in the background,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\"I'm not worried, whatever we end up wearing I think we're in with a great shout of bringing some medals home.\"\n\nThree-time overall World Cup winner Weston added: \"I have other things I can focus on and other things I'm working on to maximise my performance coming into the Olympics.\n\n\"If these new helmets get though then great it's an added bonus. But if not then we are in a pretty solid place.\"\n\nStoecker added: \"We've been competing in our regular training helmets all year and having amazing results.\n\n\"With or without that [helmet] I think we all feel really confident in the team and in our abilities and what we're going to be able to lay down at the Games.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic skeleton champion Lizzy Yarnold said: \"It's good to get the decision out of the way before official training has begun. The athletes are likely to be unaffected mentally and their preparation is unaffected.\n\n\"I personally like to see developments in elite sport, innovation is important, maybe this process will develop the rules further and create more clarity within the rules, and therefore allow for some innovation.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "By scoring a first-half hat-trick against Wolves on Saturday, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent, putting himself firmly in the England conversation.",
    "fullText": "With the World Cup four months away, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent on Saturday.\n\nThe Chelsea forward scored a first-half hat-trick as the Blues beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves 3-1 to remain firmly in the hunt for a top-four finish.\n\nTwo of those goals were penalties, with Palmer displaying his typically ice-cool demeanour to send the goalkeeper the wrong way both times.\n\nPalmer has been dogged by a groin injury this season, and the three goals almost doubled his tally for the campaign - going from four Premier League goals to seven.\n\nThe performance also puts him firmly in the England squad conversation.\n\n\"If he's impacting games, like we know he can, from now to the end of the season, he's a sure thing to be in the squad,\" former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He can play wide, he can play as a 10. He's just so good on the ball and classy and simply doesn't fear anybody.\n\n\"Even if you bring him off the bench, you know he can do unbelievable things. He can win you a game in a heartbeat.\"\n\nPalmer celebrated his opening goal against Wolves by covering his ears - a response, perhaps, to recent reports suggesting he is unsettled in London.\n\nThe former Manchester City player has had a difficult campaign in which injury has seen him in and out of the side, while under new head coach Liam Rosenior he has had his playing minutes carefully managed.\n\nSince Rosenior became Chelsea boss at the start of this year he has often faced questions about Palmer's form, fitness and state of mind.\n\nThis performance provided something of a direct response to those questions, but key for Palmer will be keeping it up.\n\n\"We know what a world-class player he is. He's played a lot of football over the last year with not much rest,\" said Rosenior.\n\n\"When he's at his best, he's unstoppable. I'm delighted to be working with him.\"\n\nThis is, after all, a player who scored twice in the Club World Cup final less than six months ago, and across the two seasons prior to this one totted up 37 Premier League goals.\n\nIf Palmer can now build momentum, he will be hitting form at just the right time.\n\nHe was a key player for England at Euro 2024 but has made just one appearance under current boss Thomas Tuchel - in a 1-0 win against Andorra last June.\n\nInjuries have been a factor, but there is also competition for places - with the likes of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham rivalling him for the number 10 role.\n\n\"At the moment it looks like Morgan Rogers and Jude Bellingham will be the two who are ahead of him,\" said former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha on BBC Final Score.\n\n\"I'd be looking to find a way to get him in the side.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would select Palmer for England, former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton was a little more blunt: \"Not at the minute, no. I'd play Rogers.\"\n\nEngland have two more friendlies lined up before the World Cup - against Uruguay on 27 March and Japan four days later - so that international camp will offer a big chance for players such as Palmer to impress Tuchel.\n\n\"I don't think Cole [Palmer] is at his best yet,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Like a lot of players, when you have had a bad injury and you've had quite a lot of time out, it does take game time to get your rhythm and your sharpness back.\n\n\"He really needs to start playing regularly to force his way into the England squad and team, because at the moment with Morgan Rogers doing what he's doing, and other players playing well, he's got a battle on his hands.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Britain's Katie Boulter claimed her fourth WTA Tour title with a three-set victory over Tamara Korpatsch at the Ostrava Open on Saturday.\n\nThe British number four, who had dropped to 120th in the world rankings, came back strongly from a set down in the final to beat German Korpatsch 5-7 6-2 6-1.\n\nBoulter's positive performance in the Czech Republic this week after an inconsistent 2025 season means she will return to the top 100 at number 84.\n\nThe 29-year-old split from her long-time coach Biljana Veselinovic last year and appointed Michael Joyce at the start of 2026.\n\nShe dedicated the win to her new coach Joyce, saying: \"We're only a few weeks into business right now Mickey but we've got one in the bag.\"\n\nRaducanu well beaten in Transylvania Open final\n\nBoulter then joked: \"And it was on your birthday week. Massive week for you, 53 years old, big one, so that was your present to you.\n\n\"I hope we can keep doing a lot of work.\"\n\nThe title win was in contrast with fellow Brit Emma Raducanu, who was well beaten by Romanian Sorana Cirstea in the Transylvania Open final.\n\nBoulter has lost only one of the five WTA finals she has reached and her win in Ostrava will be added to her two Nottingham titles (2023 and 2024) and her triumph in San Diego two years ago.\n\nDespite losing three games in a row on her way to dropping the first set, plus the opening game of the second, Boulter was able to regroup and take the final to a decider.\n\nFrom there, she was fully in control and broke 30-year-old Korpatsch's serve three times on her way to a first trophy in nearly 15 months.\n\n\"To my stable team, my whole family back home...

    "description": "Nick Ball is beaten for the first time in his professional career in front of hometown fans in Liverpool, relinquishing his world title.",
    "fullText": "Nick Ball's reign as WBA featherweight world champion ended in dramatic fashion as the British boxer was stopped in the 12th round by Brandon Figueroa in front of stunned home fans in Liverpool.\n\nAfter 11 closely contested rounds, in which Ball was at times typically bullish on the inside and Figueroa responded with relentless volume, the fight turned in an instant.\n\nSeconds into the final round at M&S Bank Arena, Figueroa landed a flush straight left that sent Ball crashing to the canvas. The 28-year-old beat the count but looked unsteady, and a sharp follow-up combination forced the referee to wave it off.\n\nUgly scenes followed as beer and objects were thrown towards the ring after a brief altercation, with members of Ball's team unhappy about the manner of Figueroa's celebrations while the deposed champion was recovering.\n\n\"I'm sorry [for the celebration], we didn't mean anything, we were just excited. Sorry about that,\" Figueroa said.\n\n\"Big shout out to Nick Ball, he is a great Liverpool champion and one of the best England have ever had. I have nothing but respect for him.\"\n\nIn his fourth defence of the world title, Ball - who left the arena without giving a post-fight interview - suffered the first defeat of his professional career, having previously gone 24 fights unbeaten with one draw.\n\nThe result scuppers his hopes of unification bouts and brings to an end a positive run of results for British boxing on the global stage following Dalton Smith and Josh Kelly's world title triumphs in January.\n\nAmerican Figueroa, meanwhile, becomes a three-weight world champion in his 30th pro bout.\n\nFigueroa stops Ball to claim WBA title from Briton - reaction\n\nFigueroa, 29, lived up to his moniker, 'Heartbreaker', on a deflating and sorrowful night for 'Wrecking' Ball and the Liverpool crowd.\n\nThe challenger was met by a chorus of jeers on his ring walk, the 7,500-capacity arena close to full and firmly partisan. Figueroa blew kisses to his loved ones and stood calmly in his corner as the noise swelled for Ball.\n\nThe Kirkby-born fighter was given a proper hometown reception. From John Conteh to Natasha Jonas, Liverpool has never been shy of producing world champions, and Ball is the latest to have carried on that proud tradition.\n\nThe contest began at a frantic pace. Ball threw 145 punches across the opening three rounds - including sharp uppercuts in the first and second – with Figueroa throwing 204 times.\n\nAt just 5ft 2in, Ball conceded seven inches in height but dismissed the idea that was a disadvantage beforehand, insisting he preferred \"punching up\" at taller opponents.\n\nAs blood trickled from the champion's nose and reddened his mouth, Figueroa continued to press and appeared the fresher man at the halfway mark.\n\nBall responded with a blistering flurry in the eighth. Figueroa winced, smiled and fired back to the body. With some tight rounds, the fight felt finely poised and destined to go to the scorecards.\n\n\"Championship rounds. This is your territory now,\" Ball's corner told him.\n\nThere was nervousness in the arena, but nobody predicted such an abrupt ending.\n\nWith Ball scrambling on the floor after the initial left, he admirably rose on the count of nine.\n\nBut Figueroa sensed the finish and unloaded - a left-right-left combination completing the job for the Texan.\n\nDuring the melee that followed the stoppage, Andrew Cain, a member of Ball's team who won his own fight on the undercard, appeared to aim a kick at one of Figueroa's cornerman.\n\nTensions were calmed quickly, and scorecards revealed the knockout was the icing on the cake for Figueroa, who was ahead of two of the three scorecards at the time of the stoppage.\n\nBall has come a long way since making his professional debut in a Liverpool nightclub and had won four fights in a row since his controversial split draw with Rey Vargas in March 2024.\n\nOf all reigning male world champions from Britain, he was the only one to have defended his title.\n\nBut that run has come to an end in the most disappointing fashion.\n\nBall's fan-friendly style had made him one of the country's most watchable fighters, with unification bouts and big-name opponents on the horizon.\n\nA potential super-fight with Japan's pound-for-pound star Naoya Inoue, the undisputed super-bantamweight champion, had also been on Ball's wishlist.\n\nInstead, Ball ran into an inspired Figueroa and must now process both the first defeat of his career and the loss of his world title.\n\nHow he responds - physically and mentally - will shape the next chapter, and overcoming this setback may prove a defining test of his character.\n\nBruce Carrington (WBC), Angelo Leo (IBF) and Rafael Espinoza (WBO) hold the other world titles in the division, but would any of them be eager to step in with Ball when he has no world title to offer?\n\nBall could seek a rematch with Figueroa, although the American might be reluctant to take that option after his knockout win.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Steve Borthwick has the pleasure of nit-picking through fine details after his England side swat aside Wales in their Six Nations opener.",
    "fullText": "Whether it was a deliberate, pointed pick, we'll never know.\n\nBut as Wales' replacements jogged out ahead of their team for the start of the second half, the Allianz Stadium DJ launched into the Kaiser Chiefs' noughties shout-a-along I Predict a Riot.\n\nAt 29-0 up, it wasn't the boldest forecast.\n\nAnd in the end, Wales showed enough fight and quality to prevent England vandalising their national pride as they did in Cardiff last March.\n\nBut, by any measure, England's 48-7 win was a walloping.\n\nBall in hand, they made nearly twice the metres of the visitors.\n\nWales were spinning like tops in defence, chasing back after 16 line-breaks. The visitors made only six in the opposite direction.\n\nEngland had almost 60% of territory. By 25 minutes in, Wales had a decimal point of hope. At best.\n\nAfterwards, England head coach Steve Borthwick thought the scoreline stat should have been even more lopsided in England's favour.\n\n\"I thought we defended exceptionally well, we kicked really well and we scored some nice tries, but I think we left a lot out there on the grass.,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We'll review this game and say there's a load of things we could do a lot better. Those are the things we need to step up next week.\n\n\"Second half we were in the 22 a lot but didn't come away with points on as many occasions as we'd have liked.\"\n\nUltimately, England made enough stick to the scoreboard to sit atop the Six Nations table after round one.\n\nMore interesting than the early-stage standings to Borthwick will be the lessons, albeit limited and caveated by the quality of the opposition, that he can take.\n\nHenry Arundell, all low-slung power and top-end speed, inevitably took the headlines after helping himself to a first-half hat-trick.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who, as a teenager, scored a try with his first touch of the ball in the Test game, has a sky-high international strike-rate.\n\nThat stat is inflated by his five against Chile in the last Rugby World Cup, as well as Saturday's work, but his ability to turn a half-break into a full five points is precious.\n\nWhen Fraser Dingwall scooped up and shovelled the ball to him for England's fourth try of the afternoon, the cover was instantly blow-torched.\n\nArundell's improvement under the high ball this season - most notably in Bath's win over Saracens opposite Noah Caluori - and defence, are qualities that have been coached into him. His fast-twitch physicality, though, is an ability beyond anyone's gift.\n\nWith the amount of slapped-back kick-chase and subsequent broken-field chaos in the modern game, it is a more of a lethal weapon than ever.\n\nArundell scores hat-trick as England heap misery on Wales\n\nRugby Union Weekly: 'Ruthless' England thrash Wales\n\n'A brilliant start for England' - relive how 'ruthless' England thrashed Wales\n\nOllie Chessum is unlikely to see his name up in the same lights, but, with Maro Itoje starting the game on the bench, the second row filled any void with a performance containing more lungs and heart than a matchday burger.\n\nBen Earl has made excellence his everyday. For someone who is not a natural number eight, he is also up there as the world's best in the position.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who has played more of his rugby at open-side flanker, made 17 carries and 78 metres, while also finishing joint top of the tackle stats with Guy Pepper and nicking a turnover.\n\nHenry Pollock's energy makes him an ideal and wildly popular second-half introduction. Would his pace and breakdown poaching ability be as effective from the start? After six appearances off the bench, might Borthwick be tempted to find out?\n\nThe most intriguing issue, though, as England roll on towards Edinburgh is Tommy Freeman.\n\nHe had a fine game in many ways, a physical, pacy presence at outside centre, who dovetailed predictably well with Northampton team-mate Dingwall. He was England's leading metre-maker by a distance.\n\nBut, converted from wing, there is, perhaps inevitably, a clunkiness sometimes in the wide channels. Tom Roebuck was one team-mate left waiting for a pass that never came.\n\nFreeman's superb aerial ability is less useful in midfield, while his head-down finishing ability came to the fore best when he was shifted back to the wing late on, pinballing through tackles as he dunked down England's seventh and final try.\n\nHis midfield move, started a year ago, was prompted by a lack of other options.\n\nNow, with Ollie Lawrence back from an Achilles tendon tear, Dingwall impressing again at 12, Max Ojomoh and Seb Atkinson in the equation and Joe Marchant and Benhard Janse van Rensburg approaching eligibility, the centre cupboard looks less bare.\n\nSometimes courage is needed to see a plan through. Conversely, sometimes wisdom is needed to know when to change one.\n\nFreeman's centre role feels like one to persevere with for now, but not blindly.\n\nBorthwick knows that with France, who found a level unreached by their rivals in beating Ireland, awaiting in the final round, that sort of tinkering, tuning and fine-margin call will need to be right if England are to reach the glorious destination they want.\n\nWe let ourselves and people at home down - Lake\n\n'Townsend on the ropes after romp in swamp'\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nPower, width & barnstorming Earl - how England attack sparked into life",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how things are shaping up as the fight for Premier League survival hots up.",
    "fullText": "For the first time since before Christmas, just three points will separate the teams in 17th and 18th at the end of a Premier League weekend.\n\nWest Ham's 2-0 victory at Burnley has at last dragged them to within touching distance of Nottingham Forest again, with the Hammers enjoying a mid-season renaissance by winning three of their past four matches.\n\nWhile Wolves and Burnley are cut completely adrift, Nuno Espirito Santo's team are seemingly keeping the relegation battle alive single-handedly.\n\nThere have only been 10 occasions since the Premier League was formed in 1992-93 that the fight for survival has not gone down to the final day - although five of those have occurred in the last decade.\n\nSo after some damp squibs in recent years, are we set for an unusually exciting end to the campaign at the bottom of the table?\n\nBBC Sport looks at how things are shaping up as clubs attempt to avoid the dreaded drop into the Championship.\n\nWhile Wolves are not mathematically down yet, they are propping up the table on a meagre eight points from 25 matches and sports analytics and data experts Opta rank their chances of relegation as 99.99%.\n\nThat also effectively means the West Midlands club are in a scrap to avoid the unwanted record of winning the fewest points in a single Premier League campaign, currently held by Derby, who managed just 11 in 2007-08.\n\nMeanwhile, Burnley's loss to the Hammers means there is a 99.4% chance they will spend next term in the second tier of English football.\n\nThere was an air of frustration around Turf Moor on Saturday with the home fans castigating the players and calling for Scott Parker's dismissal as boss after watching their team fail to win for a 16th consecutive match.\n\n\"Whether we fail or we don't fail, we come through this for sure,\" said Parker.\n\n\"I'm really sorry that I can't promise we'll be better for it with a win or with staying in this division but the longer the journey is, we will be better for it.\"\n\nHammers boss Nuno said his side \"are still in the same situation\" and called on them to \"focus on\" themselves after winning in Lancashire.\n\nHaving gone 10 Premier League matches without a win, West Ham appear to have built some momentum from Callum Wilson's dramatic late goal at Tottenham on 17 January.\n\nAnd they will feel they can tackle their remaining 13 games with renewed optimism despite being ranked with a 75.77% chance of going down, with Nuno also having the experience of guiding Nottingham Forest to safety on the final day of the 2023-24 campaign.\n\n\"West Ham look more like a Nuno team over the last few weeks,\" said former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy, who is a pundit on Saturday's Match of the Day.\n\n\"They have won three out of four and have all the momentum. Crysencio Summerville is playing out of his skin and Jarrod Bowen is always going to chip in, plus they've signed two strikers.\n\n\"All of a sudden they look like a team that can score goals and that means you don't have to rely so heavily on keeping them out the other end.\n\n\"However, you'd always rather have the points in the bag than doing the chasing as you can't have many slip-ups - you have to keep on getting points.\"\n\nWhile Forest are just three points above West Ham in 17th, Sean Dyche will hope his side has the quality to pull clear having spent around £200m on players over the last 12 months.\n\nOpta rank the two-time champions of Europe as having a 15.3% chance of being relegated and it is likely Dyche will have to juggle his resources due to the club's continued involvement in the Europa League, where they are due to face Fenerbahce in the knockout play-offs for the last 16.\n\n\"Too many times recently, I've seen Nottingham Forest look passive,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Whether that's legginess from the amount of games in which Sean Dyche has had to play the same players. He gave fringe players the chance to stake their claim against Wrexham and they didn't take it, so he's had to pick the same eight or nine week in week out.\n\n\"I've done it myself and it's hard trying to play every few days and playing to your best, especially under pressure of relegation. Plus, they are trying to manage Europe as well.\"\n\nLeeds, who claimed a valuable win over Forest on Friday, appear to be in the best form of the three sides on 29 points.\n\nCrystal Palace, who travel to Brighton on Sunday, appear to be in disarray after the departure of captain Marc Guehi and manager Oliver Glasner's confirmation he will be leaving the club at the end of the season.\n\nTottenham have also taken just four of the past 21 points available and have not won a top-flight game since the start of the year.\n\n\"Palace have got a scrap on their hands as confidence is draining,\" added Murphy.\n\n\"I'm like the majority and think Tottenham will be OK even though the results don't say it. Their squad and the quality they've got will come good and they will get enough points.\n\n\"Leeds, for me, are the ones who will be safe given the way they have played in the last two or three months. They have some really nice momentum. And we all know about the Elland Road factor, which is huge.\n\n\"So, I think it's between Forest, Palace and West Ham. It is going to be so tight. I really think its going to go down to the wire.\"\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "Newcastle boss Eddie Howe admitted he is \"not doing my job well enough\" after Saturday's defeat by Brentford - but is he under pressure?",
    "fullText": "The St James' Park crowd roared in belief.\n\nNewcastle United captain Bruno Guimaraes had just drawn his side level at 2-2 against Brentford with a confident penalty.\n\nBut the Magpies were not content with a late equaliser. Sandro Tonali picked the ball out of the net so the game could quickly restart as Guimaraes led the rest of his buoyant team-mates back into their own half.\n\nWas it going to be one of those nights on Tyneside?\n\nIt said it all that this fragile side were only level for a few short minutes before Dango Ouattara fired Brentford back in front after capitalising on poor defending.\n\nThe team's body blow was one which left home supporters stunned as Newcastle fell to a damaging 3-2 defeat.\n\nOne irate supporter even made his way towards the back of the dugout in the closing stages to urge head coach Eddie Howe to \"sort it out\" before loud boos rang out at full-time.\n\nNewcastle are now languishing in 12th place in the Premier League - and Howe cut a visibly downbeat figure after the match.\n\n\"I always feel under pressure,\" the Newcastle head coach said.\n\nOne win in eight games in all competitions is the current form.\n\n\"The type of pressure is irrelevant to me,\" Howe said.\n\n\"When you're in this job, you're always in that moment, whether it's pressure to win and keep winning or pressure to turn around results. We're very much in that feeling.\n\n\"I always say the pressure I put on myself couldn't be more extreme because I demand really high standards from what I'm doing, how I work, and what I ask the players to do. I'm obviously not doing my job well enough at the moment.\"\n\nHowe has endured sticky spells before, of course.\n\nThis is a man who took charge of a side in deep relegation trouble in 2021 and only won one of his opening 10 games in all competitions.\n\nThere was a humiliating FA Cup exit to Cambridge United along the way on an afternoon when Kieran Trippier made his debut for the club.\n\nNow, more than four years on, Trippier stressed he took \"full responsibility\" after being caught out in the build-up to all of Brentford's goals.\n\n\"It is nothing about the manager,\" Trippier told Sky Sports. \"We take responsibility for the performances.\n\n\"The manager puts the plan out and we try and execute it. I am not going down that route about the manager. I would never do that.\"\n\nBut these past few months have arguably been the most challenging of Howe's stint at the club - on and off the field - and the strain can be traced as far back to the summer.\n\nNewcastle operated without a sporting director and missed out on a number of first-choice targets, including Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and James Trafford, in a window when top scorer Alexander Isak went on strike in order to push through a move to Liverpool.\n\nHowe had a huge say on recruitment, but Newcastle ended up spending over £250m on Jacob Ramsey, Anthony Elanga, Malick Thiaw, Yoane Wissa and Nick Woltemade, as well as bringing in goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale on loan.\n\nIt was rather telling that only two recruits - Thiaw and Wissa - started against Brentford.\n\nWissa had a poked effort cleared off the line, when his side were 1-0 up, but this was another goalless outing for the former Brentford forward.\n\nHe left the field to a humiliating chorus of \"what a waste of money\" from the away end after being substituted.\n\nWissa has scored just three goals since making his debut in December, while Woltemade has only found the back of the net on one occasion in that same period.\n\nOne man who certainly knew where the goal was Alan Shearer, the club's leading scorer.\n\nShearer recognised that things are not good enough, but insisted Howe was \"not under pressure\".\n\n\"The signings in the summer - apart from Malick Thiaw - have not been good enough and hit anything like top form,\" said Shearer, who is a pundit on Saturday's Match of the Day.\n\n\"They simply haven't justified the money that was spent on them as yet and that has hindered Howe.\n\n\"Like any manager, things need to get better and they need to turn a corner, but in terms of him losing his job? Absolutely not.\"\n\nSuch esteem should not come as a surprise.\n\nThis is a manager who ended Newcastle's seven-decade wait for a major domestic trophy less than a year ago, and who led his side to Champions League qualification in 2025 and 2023.\n\nIt is why Howe commanded instant respect from chief executive David Hopkinson and sporting director Ross Wilson when they were finally appointed earlier this season.\n\nThe pair have quickly struck up a relationship with Howe, and have repeatedly talked about the importance of alignment behind the scenes at a time when there have been very public ructions at clubs elsewhere.\n\nThere has been a degree of an understanding that this side are in transition following a turbulent summer.\n\nThere is also a recognition behind the scenes that the incredibly hands-on Howe has not had much training time with his players, and has had to contend with fatigue and injuries during a relentless schedule this season, which is a relatively new phenomenon for Newcastle.\n\nNewcastle have a strong chance of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League, and have an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Aston Villa to come next week, but this season is unravelling. Fast.\n\nNo teams have dropped more points from winning positions in the league than Newcastle (19).\n\nHowe's team have only won three away games in all competitions this season, and have lost three of their last four matches at St James' Park.\n\nThey are as close to the relegation zone as they are the top five.\n\nSuch statistics are all the more damning in a week during which Hopkinson doubled down on his assertion that Newcastle would be competing for the biggest prizes by 2030.\n\nHowe certainly needs no reminding that he needs to spark a turnaround sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I've got to work better, do more and take full responsibility for everything you see on the pitch,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got to work out solutions. That's for me to do and it's the same for the players.\n\n\"I have to ask them to be really honest with themselves and look at their best level and judge how we are playing against that now in this current moment.\n\n\"I don't think there's too many who could say they're playing towards their best so that gives us growth to improve.\"\n\nOuattara gives Brentford first win at Newcastle in 92 years\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Arguments for Gregor Townsend remaining as Scotland head coach are growing increasingly small after familiar failings lead to defeat in rainy Rome, writes Tom English.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland splished and splashed through the phases at the end of a dour but compelling battle in Rome, their moment of truth had arrived - the time to deliver on their spoken words about ruthlessness was upon them.\n\nThey worked it downfield, through the puddles, through and around the demonic Italian players, over halfway and into the enemy 22.\n\nThis was it? A romp in the swamp or failure in the foulness of a Rome afternoon?\n\nAfter 29 phases the answer came. Max Williamson held up, Italy ball, game over. Italy off to a flyer, Scotland left talking about disappointment. Again.\n\nGregor Townsend gave something of a party political broadcast on behalf of the positivity party in the aftermath, a promise of jam tomorrow after gruel today. Hard to stomach, that.\n\n\"It didn't happen,\" said the head coach. \"We're going to make sure it happens next week.\"\n\nWe've heard those words before, more than once. Promises from Townsend are a weakening currency.\n\nFighting talk from his players about the introspection sessions they have put themselves through since the implosions of the autumn were words that were not acted upon when the first test of their mettle arrived.\n\nThose last minutes were their opportunity to overcome the elements, defeat a team that deserved their lead and steal a game that would have tasted sweet. But they couldn't.\n\nThey didn't warrant a win. Italy opened up a lead in biblical conditions and did just about enough to keep it.\n\nTheir celebrations were joyous, befitting a team that showed incredible heart for the fight.\n\nThis is good for Six Nations rugby. Best whisper that out of the earshot of Scotland folk.\n\nInquest begins after Italy defeat\n\nI believe in what we're doing - Townsend\n\nItaly punish lacklustre Scotland in Rome rain\n\nFor Townsend's team, in far too many games, there's uncertainty about when the damage will be done - the start or the end - but there is a near certainty that at some point it will indeed be done. It's the rhythm of life under Townsend.\n\nIn Rome, it was at the start. There was talk from within the Scotland camp that they needed to execute better when entering an opponent's 22. There were good reasons for that chat.\n\nIn last season's Six Nations, they ranked second of six in terms of visits to a rival's 22 and yet sixth of six in terms of points gained from those visits. Profligacy, as well as mental fragility, was a work-on, as they say.\n\nA few minutes into the game, Scotland had an attacking line-out in Italy's 22. A time for deeds now, not words. Clinical rugby, remember. Lessons learned. Progress.\n\nTheir ball was stolen at the front and Italy escaped. It was the beginning of an utter calamity out of touch for Ewan Ashman, in particular, and his successor, George Turner.\n\nThe conditions? Yes, abject, but Scotland's error count across the board was higher than Italy's.\n\nAt times, when throws were pilfered or just launched over the back with no jumper and seemingly no communication, it was an unholy mess.\n\nYou wouldn't have predicted a Scotland defeat that early, but you get to understand the triggers in this team and the omens weren't encouraging.\n\nEspecially so within a few minutes because Italy scored. Winning the air, as they so often did, they showed the kind of precision that Scotland only talked about. Ignacio Brex grubbered for Louis Lynagh and Italy had landed the first blow.\n\nBecoming hard to score against was another of those non-negotiables that the Scotland boys mentioned. Up in smoke already.\n\nScotland had another attacking line-out inside Italy's 22 soon after. Stolen again. A dozen minutes had been played and now, truly, you were hearing the music from Jaws ringing in the ears.\n\nFor a time, the conditions looked like they were impacting just one team out there. Italy went to the air once more, Lynagh got the better of the targeted Jamie Dobie and the score was on.\n\nMichele Lamaro, the totem of the back-row, skipped a pass out to Tommaso Menoncello and a five-point lead became 12. A dozen points in that weather is worth a whole lot more.\n\nChasing in the rain makes you panic, makes you force things, eats into what is left of your belief.\n\nTo Scotland's credit - and there's very little to go around - they scored through Jack Dempsey and again, later on, through the effervescent George Horne.\n\nPaolo Garbisi's boot and the incredibly strong will of his team kept the Scots at bay.\n\nThat and the mistake mountains the visitors constantly constructed. It was a dogfight and Italy's dogs were just that bit more menacing.\n\nTownsend went 5-3 on his bench but in the rain, in hindsight, he needed to go 6-2.\n\nGet another beast in there instead of Adam Hastings who sat it all out. What was the point of picking him if you were not going to trust him? One question among many.\n\nThe line-out and the scrum went south. Ashman's foul play saw a Scotland penalty become an Italy penalty - and another three points. Finn Russell kicked out on the full. Turner saw yellow for a daft offence at the side of a ruck.\n\nScotland killed their own momentum. It was not the kind of ruthlessness they meant when talking about what they hoped to do in Rome.\n\nHope arrived with Horne and that piece of brilliance when finishing in the corner.\n\nThe scrum-half had not long come on to the pitch, winding up his team-mates as he did so. Somebody needed to fire them up because they looked flat, the body language betraying a team that was going under.\n\nThere was a glimmer of optimism but it petered out; death by phases in the end, 29 of them that went somewhere and then nowhere, a bit like Townsend's regime, you might say.\n\nThe players failed dismally but the reaction will be an evisceration of the coach. The buck stops there, of course.\n\nScotland didn't just start treading water when they ran out into Stadio Olimpico on Saturday, they've been doing it for too long now.\n\nTownsend has a contract until 2027 with, it seems, the promise of a gig with Newcastle once the World Cup is over. Maybe there's logic in expediting that.\n\nThe justifications for allowing Townsend remaining in place for another Six Nations and a World Cup after that have become pitifully small.\n\nUnless miracles start falling out of the sky the need to end this after this Six Nations is becoming greater and greater.\n\nTownsend is now playing a miserable game of catch-up, a grim pursuit of a few wins to take the dirty look off their campaign.\n\nEngland next at Murrayfield on Saturday. Good luck with that. Wales afterwards in Cardiff. A likely win, but you wouldn't bet a bob on it. Then, France, lethal, and Ireland, who will have some of their missing players, restored.\n\nOne win from five is the vista here. It's untenable if it pans out that way.\n\nUntenable if the Scottish Rugby Union decision-makers do their job. No promise of that. No promise of anything, especially Townsend's vow to make amends in the Calcutta Cup. The plaintive cry has become tiresome.",

While the stated criteria emphasized high-quality writing and nonpolitical content, more than $2 million in prize money largely flowed to users ranging from popular right-wing influencers to anonymous accounts whose content mirrored the policy positions and grievances Musk has amplified since acquiring the platform.\n\nThe $1 million grand prize went to X user @beaverd for an article titled “Deloitte, a $74 billion cancer metastasized across America,” which aggregated data about government contracts with the consulting giant. Deloitte contracts were targeted for cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency when Musk was leading the Trump administration initiative. DOGE terminated at least 127 Deloitte contracts, according to Business Insider.\n\nMusk personally engaged with the winner prior to the announcement, replying “Troubling” to the user’s article on Jan. 20.\n\nMusk had also responded to a post by @beaverd claiming fraud at Minneapolis day care centers, writing, “Wow.”\n\nThe user has a history of racist and fringe posts on X.\n\nIn one post, @beaverd wrote, “i think america is ready for a shade of white lets send those somali’s back.” In another, the user said, “we gave multi culturalism a good college try it doesnt work. no more white guilt.” In December, Musk made a post saying “No more white guilt” as well.\n\nIn a November 2024 exchange, @beaverd weighed in after another user commented on photos of then-President-elect Donald Trump meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House. “Weird that he looks so happy while hanging out with literally Hitler,” the other user commented, to which @beaverd replied: “God I wish he was literally Hitler.”\n\nThe @beaverd account did not respond to NBC News’ questions about the nature of previous posts or if the prize money had been received. X did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBeyond the grand prize winner, the slate of runners-up and honorable mentions suggests the rule against political posts was selectively enforced. Many of the winning articles mirrored specific right-wing policy positions or culture war topics that dominate the platform’s current ecosystem.\n\nOne of the honorable mention awards was given to internet personality Kaizen Asiedu for his article “White People Didn’t Invent Slavery. The West Ended It.” Musk had posted in support of the article on Jan. 24, prior to the winners being announced, writing, “True.”\n\nIn August 2025, Asiedu had posted a video with the caption, “White people didn’t invent slavery,” to which Musk replied, “This is historical fact.”\n\nAnother honorable mention went to content creator Nick Shirley, who went viral after making a video with claims of fraud at Somali-run day care centers in Minnesota. His article submission was titled “How I Exposed Fraud, ended Tim Walz and proved MSM is dead.” The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families previously told NBC News it had visited the nine facilities referenced in the video and found them “operating as expected.”\n\nMusk has posted several times about Shirley’s video and wrote in one response, “This is very common btw.” After being awarded $100,000, Shirley posted to thank Musk and X.\n\nThe pattern continued with the $500,000 “runner up” award, given to @KobeissiLetter for an article analyzing Trump’s tariff strategies. The user has had at least 11 public interactions with Musk dating back to 2023.\n\nVenture capitalist Josh Wolfe also won a $100,000 honorable mention award for the article “The Arctic Smokescreen,” which attempts to explain Trump’s Greenland acquisition strategy. Musk has supported Trump’s plans to acquire Greenland, writing in a post earlier this year, “The people of Greenland should decide their future and I think they want to be part of America!”\n\nWolfe has previously posted in support of Musk, responding to a video post by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., calling Musk “unintelligent.”\n\n“I’ve been critical of @elonmusk on tesla. I love Spacex, I like DOGE. I think AOC is a populist huckster grifter. Maybe she thinks attacking Elon will galvanize her base and help her raise money. I hope Elon gets her out of office,” Wolfe wrote in February 2025.\n\nTwo other winners, Ryan Hall and Dan Koe, were respectively awarded $100,000 and $250,000 for nonpolitical articles. Hall’s article focused on weather patterns while Koe provided advice on how to improve focus.\n\nThe competition won’t be the last time X will reward creators monetarily.\n\nOn Wednesday, the X Creators account announced a Super Bowl promotion to give away $1 million, $500,000 and $250,000 in cash prizes to three creators of video ads for Grok, xAI’s chatbot, made with the company’s video model. In January, the video generation tool attracted global criticism after an update allowed it to generate thousands of sexualized deepfakes of real people per hour, according to some counts.\n\nUsers have already generated ads for the contest containing racist slurs.\n\nThe winning videos will be will be “featured on X during Game Day.”\n\nBruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team.\n\nTavleen Tarrant is an associate social newsgathering reporter for NBC News",

    "description": "BBC health correspondent James Gallagher gets his blood analysed to understand how air pollution is killing us.",
    "fullText": "I'm in a laboratory staring at my blood under a microscope. Rather than pristine red blood cells, some of them have been tainted with black markings. I'm now one of the first people in the world to see air pollution building up inside their body.\n\nLess than an hour ago I was standing next to four lanes of busy central London traffic. It was the type of road where you can taste the air and you're left with a gritty sensation in your mouth.\n\nI had volunteered to stand there for 10 minutes; breathing in dirty air as part of an experiment to understand how air pollution is affecting our bodies and damaging our health.\n\nIn the UK, poor air quality is thought to kill 30,000 people a year, as well as harming babies in the womb and exacerbating conditions from asthma to dementia.\n\nMost of the air pollution I was breathing in came from traffic – billowing invisibly out of exhaust pipes, but also released by the wear and tear of tyres and brakes.\n\nProf Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, calls this spot his \"exposure chamber\".\n\nShouting over the blare of revving engines and sirens, he tells me most people incorrectly assume air pollution is all filtered out by our nose or mouth, or is trapped and then brought up out of the lungs.\n\n\"What we're looking at is whether the smallest particles are not only staying in your lung, but moving across into your bloodstream and going around your body,\" says Grigg.\n\nAfter our dose of London air, we head back to the laboratory where I have my finger pricked and a sample of blood prepared for examination.\n\nUnder the microscope, we can easily see the red disc-shaped cells that transport oxygen around our bodies.\n\nIt takes a few minutes for me to get my eyes in, but then the air pollution becomes apparent. It appears as tiny black dots stuck to the red blood cells.\n\nThese are pieces of carbon and other chemicals, like a miniature lump of coal, that come from the incomplete burning of fuel. They're known as PM 2.5, because the particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometres.\n\nI'm not surprised to see air pollution, it's why we're doing the experiment, but I can't escape a feeling of being dirtied, contaminated… sullied by it.\n\nResearcher Dr Norrice Liu has looked at more than a dozen volunteers' blood samples as part of a study.\n\nOn average, one in every two to three thousand red blood cells had picked up a hitch-hiking piece of pollution.\n\nThat might not sound like much, but scale it up to the full five litres of blood in an adult and the researchers estimate there could be 80 million red blood cells transporting pollution around our bodies.\n\n\"It's a bit upsetting to see that, isn't it?\" says Liu. \"Every time I walk by a busy road, now I'm thinking how much of this is travelling around my body… you just feel like you don't want to be out on the road much.\"\n\nI stood beside the road for just 10 minutes. It was busy, but it was not an extreme scenario. Your blood has probably looked like this too.\n\nThe team at Queen Mary University of London have shown that levels of air pollution in the blood come back down after about two hours of breathing clean air.\n\nGrigg was \"pretty shocked\" the air pollution was so visible in blood, but says the important question is where it's going.\n\nIt's not being breathed back out, he says, some may be filtered out by the kidneys and leave the body in urine. But the most likely answer is that particles of pollution are \"wiggling their way through the lining of the blood vessels and lodging in various organs\".\n\nThis research is starting to explain why air pollution has been linked to so many health problems far beyond the lungs, including in the brain and for babies still in the womb.\n\nDeposits of black carbon from air pollution have been found in the human body including in placentas analysed after birth.\n\n\"There's no reason why it's choosing one organ over another,\" says Liu, \"so chances are they're everywhere.\"\n\nAnd there are other forms of air pollution, such as nitrogen oxides, which are gases and are not visible down the microscope, but are known to cause harm.\n\nThe World Health Organization says 99% of the world population breathes in polluted air leading to seven million deaths a year. A report by the Royal College of Physicians estimates the figure for the UK is 30,000 deaths a year.\n\nSir Stephen Holgate, who led that report, said there was no doubt air pollution was damaging our health - \"it's nailed, it's game set and match\" - and the clearest evidence was coming from areas that were cutting air pollution and seeing the benefit.\n\nBut now that air pollution is \"largely invisible\", unlike the smogs of yesteryear, most of us don't realise we're breathing it in and \"don't really understand that air pollution on a daily basis is damaging\", he says.\n\nAir pollution has been linked to harms throughout our lives and throughout our bodies.\n\nThere are many ways dirty air can harm the other organs of our body, but triggering inflammation is thought to be the main one. Inflammation is our body's natural response to injury and infection, but can also affect blood vessels to make heart attacks and strokes more likely.\n\nInflammation in the lungs has been shown to wake up dormant cancerous cells, which then develop into deadly tumours. Around one in 10 lung cancers are thought to be caused by air pollution in the UK.\n\nEven while in the womb, air pollution is even thought to alter how a developing baby's DNA is functioning during critical stages of development.\n\n\"There's a very sensitive period when air pollution can cause a problem and it undoubtedly does: small lungs, small heart and some problems with brain development,\" says Sir Stephen.\n\nAt the other end of life, components of air pollution seem to be \"accelerating the process\" of dementia, he says, by helping plaques of toxic proteins form inside the brain.\n\nThere is advice on how to minimise our exposure to air pollution - including walking on quieter side streets or keeping away from the edge of the road so you're further from traffic. This is especially important for babies in buggies, who are much closer to the height of exhaust pipes.\n\nGrigg's study showed a tight-fitting FFP2 mask led to less air pollution in the blood, but \"we're not saying that everyone should wear a mask\", says Grigg, adding some clinically vulnerable people including those \"recovering from a heart attack or have chronic respiratory disease\" might benefit while in areas of high pollution.\n\nBut the tricky thing with air pollution is you're often breathing in the pollution caused by other people. It is not easy to just live somewhere else if your house is on a busy road.\n\nChanges to cars – not just sales of electric vehicles, but emissions standards on newer diesel and petrol engines – are improving air quality.\n\nBut Grigg says: \"I think the more we understand the mechanisms of how it can cause these effects, the more we can add to the pressure for policy makers to reduce exposure - because that's the answer in the end.\"\n\nInside Health was produced by Tom Bonnett",

    "title": "Font Rendering from First Principles",
    "description": "Learn what it takes to build a font renderer from scratch in C.",
    "fullText": "Font rendering is a technology that often gets taken for granted -- it's hard to imagine interacting with computers without it. But how hard could it really be? Turns out, way harder than you might think:\n\nLooking at FreeType (GPL-licensed, used in e.g. Chromium, GNU/Linux, etc.), they claim to be >200k LOC.\n\nI decided to roll my own. In this article, I provides a high level walkthrough of the TTF file spec and my implementation. But first, why not just use FreeType, or some other equivalent? What's the benefit of going through it yourself?\n\nBefore we can start rendering strings, we first need to read the font data in. I focused on TTF (TrueType) file format for my implementation. The other generally used format, OTF (OpenType), can be considered a superset of TTF (also including PostScript fonts), so if you wanted to render OTF fonts, you'd have to make a TTF parser anyway. There are plenty of fonts expressed using TTF over OTF, certainly enough to cover my initial use case (latin alphanumeric glyphs), so I doubt I'm going to extend the implementation to OTF any time soon.\n\nAt a high level, TTF files provide some mapping between character codepoints to glyph information.\n\nA character's \"codepoint\" refers to its unicode encoding format. You may be familiar with ASCII encoding, which is a 1-byte wide representation of each character in the latin alphabet (for example, the character 'A' maps to 65, 'z' maps to 122, etc.). A major limiting factor with ASCII is it doesn't provide nearly enough space to describe non-latin languages as well. Unicode is an internationally adopted solution to this problem. Unicode has various encoding formats, for example UTF-8 and UTF-32; their only difference is how they encode this codepoint (UTF-32 always represents codepoints using 4 bytes, UTF-8 uses a variable length). Conveniently, UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII (thanks, Ken Thompson & Rob Pike). Since I'm only focusing on the latin alphabet for now, this means the codepoint for 'a' can be retrieved via (uint8_t) ('a'). Read more about the Unicode standard here.\n\nGlyphs are just an abstraction over letters and characters. TTF files have no notion of what the letter 'a' is, rather it's an opaque mapping of some value (unicode codepoint) to some data about that value (glyph). This includes the literal points and curves associated with that line, so that we can draw it, as well as additional metrics about that character that we need to be careful to consider -- the latin alphabet highlights why these metrics are important, look at this image as an example:\n\nHere, the same string is rendered twice (below: the readable string, above: each glyph's texture is fully opaque). Observe the differences between glyphs -- how the center sits in relation to the baseline, how much space is added between characters, all of this is highly dependent on which font and which characters you're trying to render. To learn more, I would recommend taking a look at the FreeType documentation.\n\nGetting back to TTF files, you can find the reference manual here. You'll quickly notice that the overarching file format itself isn't too terribly complicated; there are a number of tables that contain different pieces of information on the individual glyphs that make up the font as a whole. Only a handful of tables are immediately relevant:\n\nFrom this, we can start to paint a picture on how we should get to our font shape information. For each character we want to render:\n\nThere are a few other tables that have some useful information worth noting:\n\nThere are certainly other tables for you to inspect as is relevant to your use case (e.g. vhea and vmtx exist for vertical languages). A major part of the TTF file spec is specifying instructions for scaling the font to specific resolutions -- this becomes more important if you're planning on only supporting bitmap rendering at smaller scales. I've found that alternative approaches, namely SDF-based rendering, achieve high quality results without having to muck about with this part of the spec, so I've ignored these tables.\n\nOne of the main challenges at this step is validating the data you're reading in from the TTF file data, since we're reading from an opaque binary blob (which, at least I'm not super used to). Running a debugger is your friend here. I'd also suggest becoming familiar with and comparing your results against another known-good TTF parser for comparison when times get tough, I used stb_truetype for this purpose.\n\nGreat, now we know where our glyph data lives, it's time to parse it. Follow along in the reference manual: here.\n\nTTF glyphs are comprised of a series of contours, which themselves are described as a series of quadratic Bezier curves. These are comprised of 3 points: a start point, an end point, and a \"control\" point. Bezier curves are formally defined as a \"linear combination\" of these points (start -> control -> end), where, given t in range [0, 1], calculate the linear interpolation between point pairs, recursively, until you collapse to a single point. For example, for a given t = 0.4, we place an intermediary point 40% of the way between the start and control point, and 40% of the way between the control point and the end point, then repeat, placing our final, on-curve point 40% of the way between our intermediary points. This is repeated for all t values between 0 and 1 to create the final curve. This is probably easier to understand visualized:\n\nAnother way to describe quadratic Bezier curves is by the formula: (((1-t)^2) * P_start) + (2(1 - t)t * P_control) + ((t^2) * P_end), where, again t is in the range [0, 1] (this isn't so bad once you realize this is just a regular quadratic under the hood).\n\nMoving back up the chain, these curves are combined to form contours, which are combined to form the overall glyph shape. As an example, here are the contours describing the glyph 'B' in the Consola font, where each contour is a separate color (note that Bezier control points are colored in purple):\n\nWe see that, in this case, there are 3 separate contours: one for the \"outer shell\", and two for the \"holes\" to cut out of it. The TTF spec requires that these classes of contours be defined separately -- the ordering of \"shell\" contour points must be clockwise, and \"hole\" contour points must be counter-clockwise. We will use this information later when rasterizing the glyph to know when we are entering or exiting the shape, so it's good to note here.\n\nTTF stores the quadratic Bezier points in a set of contiguous arrays, that, once parsed, collapse to a pretty simple struct:\n\nNext, we need to unravel a bit of compression TTF applies to our point data. Sometimes, it omits points from the stream -- we have to add them back in. Consider that the expected stream of points would look something like: point (on-curve) -> point (off-curve) -> point (on-curve) -> repeat. Looking at the data stream we are actually provided, we often encounter situations like point (off-curve) -> point (off-curve) -- what do we do here?. In these scenarios, an on-curve point is implied to be at the midpoint of these off-curve points, and we need to add it in ourselves. Additionally, the spec is happy to give you cases like point (on-curve) -> point (on-curve) -- there aren't any tricks here, this is just a straight line between these two points, it's just another case to be on the lookout for that's separate from the quadratic Bezier case.\n\nThe way I chose to model this is by describing the curve as follows:\n\nWhere the end of the bezier curve is implied to be the start point of the next bezier curve in the contour. I chose to force line-cases into this model by inserting an unnecessary control point at the midpoint to simplify processing later down the line, you can certainly choose to break these cases apart and handle them separately.\n\nThe file spec also describes \"compound glyphs\" -- this is essentially another form of compression. Some characters contain sub-glyphs that are commonly used throughout a given font (think the dot over 'i' and 'j', or diacritics over characters like é) -- rather than copying the countour data several times to cover all of the characters, TTF instead defines them in as separate glyphs, and instructs you to merge them using a set of transformations as relevant for the target character. The exact transformation calculations are described in more detail in the spec, but the hard part of actually retrieving the contour shapes themselves is reused as described above.\n\nWith shapes in hand, it's time to get rasterizing. The algorithm is loosely as follows:\n\nIdentify a target portion of a bitmap we want to rasterize to.\n\nYou could generate separate bitmaps for each character, but it's likely may more efficient / optimal to generate an atlas comprising all of your characters, and index into that when issuing draw calls to the GPU later down the line. This is what I did. Therefore, we need to determine which sub-section of the atlas to render the character bitmap to.\n\nFor each row (y-value) in the target bitmap, determine the corresponding y-value in glyph space.\n\nThis can be done by a simple linear mapping between the two spaces. E.g. we know the height of our target bitmap and the height of the glyph, so, given some y value in target bitmap space, the corresponding y in glyph space can be found by using proportions (y / target_height = ??? / glyph height). One thing to pay attention to here is we want to measure from the middle of the pixel, not the top or bottom.\n\nDetermine the x-intersections in the contour for our y-value in glyph space.\n\nThis can be done by solving for t in the quadratic Bezier formula -- in cases where 0 <= t <= 1, we have an intersection (since the curves are chained together, I only checked for intersections 0 <= t < 1, as Bezier_n(1) == Bezier_n+1(0)). BEWARE! that solving the quadratic involves dividing by some variable value, which can be 0 -- these cases describe Bezier curves that are secretly lines. For these cases, you should instead check for a linear intersection instead. My earlier decision to force lines into a quadratic Bezier representation works nicely here, because we have to implement this check anyway.\n\nFor each intersection, determine if it's \"entering\" or \"leaving\" the shape.\n\nE.g. consider a ray shooting across horizontally at the hole in the letter 'A' -- there are four separate intersection points along this line. We need to determine which sets of intersections constitue \"in\" and \"out\" of the shape. It's reasonable to think that we should always have an even number of intersections for a given line; for every entrance there must be an exit. However, in reality, due to floating point precision errors (and other eldritch magic), this may not always be the case.\n\nThis can be handled by taking advantage of how contours are described in the TTF spec. As described previously, \"shells\" must be defined clockwise, and \"holes\" must be defined counter-clockwise. Therefore, by looking at the derivative of Bezier curves we intersect with, we can determine whether we are entering (y-value increasing) or leaving (y-value decreasing) the shape. The Apple spec recommends accumulating a running winding count as we encounter intersection points -- this is implemented by +/- 1 for each intersection we encounter depending on whether we are entering or leaving the shape. When the winding order is > 0, the pen should be down and we should be drawing. Otherwise, the pen should be up.\n\nConvert the intersections to target bitmap space, and rasterize.\n\nNow that we have all the information we need, we can index into our target bitmap and color it in depending on whether each x-value is in or out of the shape.\n\nGreat, we're done! What do the results look like?\n\nPretty bad... Why? From what I can tell, this happens for a couple of reasons.\n\nThe lack of anti-aliasing (although, enabling linear sampling doesn't save it...).\n\nTTF fonts have additional instructions for how to render bitmaps at various sizes that we're willfully ignoring right now.\n\nBitmap fonts don't scale very well.\n\nIdeally, we want our bitmap atlases to be of a relatively small point size, to save on memory space. However, from my experience, we only really achieve decent-looking results when the font size is relatively high (the example here is rendered to a size of 32 pixels, and still looks bad).\n\nThere are a number of options we can do to correct our suboptimal font rasters (MSDF was another option I considered, you could also look at sub-pixel rendering). I chose to go with generating an SDF for the glyph, which was attractive, as it's fairly straightforward to add on as an additional step to what has already been implemented here (e.g. for bitmap rasterization). Furthermore, SDF fonts scale very well to arbitrary resolutions, which is a reasonable constraint e.g. when rendering signs, etc. in 3D environments (e.g. games where the player may walk arbitrarily close to the font being rendered). I've also found that SDF fonts look reasonable in 2D scenarios as well (e.g. for UIs, menus, etc.).\n\nBut first, what even is an SDF? How will it fix our problem here?\n\nSDF stands for \"signed distance field\". SDFs can be described as a functional representation of an arbitrary shape that determines the distance to the edge of that shape (\"signed\" comes from this value being negative inside the shape, positive outside the shape). As relevant for font rendering, instead of computing a binary \"is this in or out\" decision for every pixel in our target bitmap, we determine the distance from that pixel to the closest point of the opposite state (drawn or not-drawn). This provides a smooth gradient along the edge of the shape of \"in-ness\" that we can leverage along with the GPU's ability to quickly and efficiently interpolate between values at scale to render font characters at a higher range of resolutions compared to raw bitmap representations. To learn more about SDFs (and how they can be more generally applied to 2/3D shapes), this article by Xor is a good starting point.\n\nHere's an SDF for the letter 'B'. Notice how there is a gradient around the letter as we extend further beyond the hard edge for the letter -- we can use this to anti-alias the raw bitmap.\n\nTo generate the SDF of a given glyph, as per this Valve paper on the subject:\n\nGenerate the bitmap of the glyph.\n\nThis reuses what we implemented before entirely.\n\nFrom my experience, rasterizing a comparatively large bitmap is important here, to provide a high level of granularity to the later steps. Essentially, the higher the resolution, the more accurate the distance measurement is later, leading to higher quality results. Since the bitmap raster is not maintained after the SDF is generated, we don't need to pay that high of a memory cost to hold the high-resolution bitmap raster over a longer period of time. I default to a bitmap font height of 64 here.\n\nSimilarly to bitmap rasterization, we need to determine where in a target bitmap to place the SDF raster.\n\nFor each pixel in the SDF target bitmap, we need to determine which pixel is closest in the raw bitmap. This is similar, but slightly different from generating the raw bitmap -- in that case, we only needed to map target bitmap y-values (here, we do it for every pixel).\n\nFor every pixel in the target SDF bitmap, determine the closest distance to a pixel of the opposite state in the raw glyph bitmap.\n\nThis can be done by choosing some \"spread factor\" (kernel size) and searching in a square of that size around the target pixel. This parameter is tune-able, I've found a value of 4 is reasonable here. In cases where no on pixel is found, use the maximum distance possible for the given kernel size.\n\nMap the distance to a byte range [0, 255] and save that to the SDF atlas.\n\nA caveat here is that the produced SDF bitmaps here aren't meant for rendering by themselves -- these are better described as a cache of SDF function values for each candidate glyph. So, we need additional instructions for how to convert these distance values into an actual bitmap we can draw to the screen. I produced a shader (OpenGL) for this purpose. Of more interest is the fragment shader:\n\nYou'll see that we extract the cached distance value for each given pixel we're rendering, applying some smoothstep over it to determine the alpha, using the result in the final pixel color. Put simply, this determines at what distance along the field of \"in-ness\" around the SDF do we actually consider in and out of that character. This is controlled by 2 parameters, threshold, which is the cut of in / out, and smoothing, which applies some gradual transition / blurring over the threshold value.\n\nSo, what do these results look like?\n\nMuch better here. What does this look like side by side with the raw bitmap? Are there still deficiencies in SDF rasters?\n\nThis is using a bitmap height of 100 and SDF height of 32 (scaled to various render heights). You can see that, by and large, SDF looks better than raw bitmap across the board. But, we start to see some undesirable artifacting appear at larger font sizes. This can be corrected by rendering the SDF atlas at a higher resolution, but that comes with a higher memory cost associated, so pick your poison.\n\nIn the end, the results don't look too bad. Here's an example where I'm using this technique to render some UI widgets:\n\nMy implementation can be found in full here.\n\nIf you're looking for more resources on learning how to roll your own font rendering, I recommend the following:",

    "fullText": "When you use an AI service, you’re handing over your thoughts in plaintext. The operator stores them, trains on them, and–inevitably–will monetize them. You get a response; they get everything.\n\nConfer works differently. In the previous post, we described how Confer encrypts your chat history with keys that never leave your devices. The remaining piece to consider is inference—the moment your prompt reaches an LLM and a response comes back.\n\nTraditionally, end-to-end encryption works when the endpoints are devices under the control of a conversation’s participants. However, AI inference requires a server with GPUs to be an endpoint in the conversation. Someone has to run that server, but we want to prevent the people who are running it (us) from seeing prompts or the responses.\n\nThis is the domain of confidential computing. Confidential computing uses hardware-enforced isolation to run code in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The host machine provides CPU, memory, and power, but cannot access the TEE’s memory or execution state.\n\nLLMs are fundamentally stateless—input in, output out—which makes them ideal for this environment. For Confer, we run inference inside a confidential VM. Your prompts are encrypted from your device directly into the TEE using Noise Pipes, processed there, and responses are encrypted back. The host never sees plaintext.\n\nBut this raises an obvious concern: even if we have encrypted pipes in and out of an encrypted environment, it really matters what is running inside that environment. The client needs assurance that the code running is actually doing what it claims.\n\nConfidential computing solves this with remote attestation. When a confidential VM boots, the hardware generates a signed quote—a cryptographic statement containing hashes of the kernel, initrd, and command line. These hashes are called measurements, and they uniquely identify the code running inside the TEE.\n\nFor Confer, we extend the measurement to cover the entire root filesystem using dm-verity. This builds a merkle tree over every byte of the filesystem and embeds the merkle root hash in the kernel command line. Since the command line is measured, any change to any file changes the attestation. The measurement now covers everything.\n\nBut a measurement is just a hash. To verify it, someone needs to be able to reproduce it.\n\nThe Confer proxy and image are built with nix and mkosi to produce bit-for-bit reproducible outputs. Anyone can clone the repository, run the build, and get the exact same measurements.\n\nEach release is also signed and published to a transparency log that is easily searchable. The log is append-only and publicly auditable, which means we can’t quietly publish a different build for different users.\n\nNow we have an intuition for how these parts can come together.\n\nWhen you open Confer and start a conversation, your client initiates a Noise handshake with the inference endpoint. The TEE responds with its attestation quote embedded in the noise handshake.\n\nYour client verifies the quote’s signature, confirming it came from genuine TEE hardware. It checks that the public key in the quote matches the one used in the handshake–this binds the encrypted channel to the TEE, preventing interception or replay by anything outside it. It extracts the measurements and confirms they match a release in the transparency log.\n\nOnce verification succeeds, the handshake completes. Your client now has cryptographic assurance that it’s talking directly to verified code running in hardware-enforced isolation.\n\nAll traffic to the inference endpoint is then encrypted with ephemeral session keys that provide forward secrecy: even if a long-term key were later compromised, past conversations remain protected because the ephemeral keys no longer exist.\n\nConfer combines confidential computing with passkey-derived encryption to ensure your data remains private.\n\nThis is different from traditional AI services, where your prompts are transmitted in plaintext to an operator who stores them in plaintext (where they are vulnerable to hackers, employees, subpoenas), mines them for behavioral data, and trains on them.\n\nWe think Confer is how AI should work.\n\nDon't have Confer? Give it a try!",

    "fullText": "In a new study, researchers say that non-biological sources they considered could not fully account for the abundance of organic compounds in a sample collected on Mars by NASA’s Curiosity rover.\n\nIn March 2025, scientists reported identifying small amounts of decane, undecane, and dodecane in a rock sample analyzed in the chemistry lab aboard Curiosity. These were the largest organic compounds found on Mars, with researchers hypothesizing that they could be fragments of fatty acids preserved in the ancient mudstone in Gale Crater. On Earth, fatty acids are produced mostly by life, though they can be made through geologic processes, too.\n\nIt was not possible to determine from Curiosity’s data alone whether or not the molecules they found were made by living things, which led to a follow-on study that evaluated known non-biological sources of these organic molecules — such as delivery by meteorites smashing into the Martian surface — to see if they could account for the amounts previously found.\n\nReporting on Feb. 4 in the journal Astrobiology, researchers say that as the non-biological sources they considered could not fully explain the abundance of organic compounds, it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that living things could have formed them.\n\nTo reach their conclusion, scientists combined lab radiation experiments, mathematical modeling, and Curiosity data to “rewind the clock” about 80 million years — the length of time the rock would have been exposed on the Martian surface. This allowed them to estimate how much organic material would have been present before being destroyed by long-term exposure to cosmic radiation: far more than typical non-biological processes could produce.\n\nThe team says more study is needed to better understand how quickly organic molecules break down in Mars-like rock under Mars-like conditions — and before any conclusions can be reached about the absence or presence of life.\n\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (PIX11) — A New Jersey mother is sharing her daughter’s story in hopes of changing how high-caffeine drinks are labeled across the country, and the effort is now reaching Capitol Hill.\n\n“That was the day when my life changed forever,” Jill Katz said. It’s been years since her daughter Sarah died. In 2022, the 21-year-old college student went into cardiac arrest while out with friends. Her mother says it all started with a cup of lemonade, packed with caffeine.\n“She was at a friend’s birthday party, in college, and she collapsed. She didn’t make it,” Katz said. “It’s the call that keeps parents awake at night.”\n\nSarah had a heart condition, and her family says she had always been mindful about what she ate and drank. According to her mother, she didn’t realize that 30 ounces of the drink she ordered at a popular restaurant chain contained as much as 390 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nFor context, the FDA says most healthy adults should consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, so the drink Sarah had was close to that limit in a single serving. “With grief, there is no restoration, but transformation,” Katz said. “Being involved with her legacy and being able to save other people’s lives in her memory.”\n\nMore: Latest News from Around the Tri-State\n\nThe restaurant chain has since removed the item from its menu following multiple lawsuits.\n\nCaffeine is widely used to boost energy by stimulating metabolism and making the heartbeat faster. Doctors, however, say high doses can be risky, especially for people with underlying conditions.\n\nAccording to the Caffeine Informer database, a single shot of espresso contains about 77 milligrams of caffeine. Energy drinks can range from 80 to 300 milligrams, depending on the brand and size. “When you stimulate so much, and the heart is not prepared for that, they can just collapse,” said cardiologist Dr. Daniel Garcia.\n\nGarcia says the lack of consistent labeling and regulation around caffeine can be dangerous for everyone, from college students to older adults. “As a cardiologist, I advise completely against any energy drink or high-content caffeine drink,” he said. “You don’t know exactly what the amount is and how your body is going to respond.”\n\nNow, Sarah’s death is drawing attention from lawmakers.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Rob Menendez is pushing for the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, federal legislation that would require clearer warnings about caffeine in foods and beverages.\n\nRequire companies to clearly list caffeine content on bottles, cans, and packaging.\n\nRequire chain restaurants to disclose caffeine levels on menus.\n\nFlag items with 150 milligrams or more of caffeine with a visible “high caffeine” warning.\n\nAdd advisory language about recommended daily caffeine limits.\n\nOrder federal health agencies to study caffeine’s health effects and launch public education campaigns.\n\nSupporters say the goal is not to ban caffeinated drinks, but to make sure consumers know what they’re getting before they take a sip. “People need to know what they’re putting in their bodies,” Katz said. “We’re not talking about limiting or banning. We’re talking about making an informed choice.”\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support in Congress, with a total of 14 cosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "description": "The billionaire former \"Shark Tank\" star and Dallas Mavericks owner is a dedicated AI user.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban said artificial intelligence is only in its early stages and has the potential to create massive wealth—possibly even the world’s first trillionaire. He uses AI extensively in his personal life and sees it as a powerful tool for improving productivity and creativity. Still, he acknowledged the risks and limitations of AI.\n\nSome of the world’s largest and most successful tech companies were built at home: Steve Jobs founded Apple in the garage of his parents’ home, and Jeff Bezos also founded Amazon in his garage.\n\nAnd thanks to artificial intelligence, the trend of developing blockbuster companies at home is sure to continue. Mark Cuban, the billionaire former principal owner of the Dallas Mavericks and Shark Tank star, recently said AI could help make the world’s first trillionaire.\n\n“We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what [AI is] going to be able to do,” Cuban told the High Performance podcast in an episode published last summer. “And not only do I think it’ll create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in the basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”\n\nTake OpenAI, for example, which was formed in cofounder and president Greg Brockman’s living room in 2015. OpenAI is reportedly vying for an $800 billion valuation as it pursues more funding. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is worth about $2 billion.\n\nWhile that’s a far cry from AI creating the world’s first trillionaire, a September 2024 report by wealth-tracking service Informa Connect said Tesla CEO Elon Musk is on pace to become a trillionaire by 2027.\n\n“There’s always something bigger and better that’s created by an innovative entrepreneur,” Cuban said. “But AI just dwarfs all that.”\n\nCuban appears to firmly believe in the power of AI, and said we’re only in the “preseason” of what the technology can really do.\n\n“As it becomes more advanced—and I’m not saying we’re going to get the Terminator—I’m not saying all of a sudden there’s going to be robots that are smarter than people, like the movie,” he told High Performance. “But we’ll find ways to make our lives better, more interesting, to work better, more effectively.”\n\nCuban also said he uses AI for nearly everything. He gave an example of how he uses it to track health metrics since he suffers from atrial fibrillation (“A-fib”).\n\nHe had to track when he was taking medications and working out, and used ChatGPT to help him record it. He also asked ChatGPT to let him know if there’s something he writes down that doesn’t seem right or that he should be concerned about.",

During the National Governors Association meeting later this month, President Donald Trump, 79, will only convene with Republican governors, state leaders learned on Friday. The move breaks from decades of meetings between the president and governors across the aisle. It also undermines the NGA’s stated goal of bipartisanship. The NGA meeting is scheduled for the weekend of Feb. 19 in Washington, D.C. The change in invite list comes after a series of public sparring matches with Democratic governors, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Minnesota’s Tim Walz.",

    "fullText": "Despite bringing in a $156,000 annual salary, a Chicago family is struggling to afford groceries, something the wife attributes to her husband’s growing $700-a-month addiction to tobacco and marijuana.\n\n“My husband is an addict,” Megan said during an episode of “The Ramsey Show” last year. She is a stay-at-home mother pregnant with their third child and called for advice from personal finance experts Dave Ramsey and Jade Warshaw. Megan said her husband typically spends around $6,000 a year on the habit, but the past couple of months have been worse due to the deaths of his father and grandfather.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nBecause of her husband’s “erratic behavior,” Megan told the hosts she’s hesitant to pay off their $20,000 car loan even though they have the money. She fears that the freed-up $600 monthly payment would just vanish into his habit.\n\nRamsey immediately challenged the framing. “If I was to say that my wife was an addict, that would mean that our marriage was either getting ready to end or she was getting help next week,” he said. “But you use this like it’s part of the budget. If you’re going to call him an addict, you’re going to have to act like it.”\n\nHe added that if her concern is simply that her husband occasionally uses substances and it’s costing them $500 to $700 a month, that's a very different scenario than describing him as an addict.\n\nTrending: Designed for investors with strong market convictions, REX Shares builds ETFs for income, leverage, and tactical positioning — explore the lineup.\n\nWhen they asked about his income structure, Megan revealed she brings in no income currently. Her husband earns the entire household income. They take home about $7,800 per month after taxes, yet Megan said food insecurity remains a problem.\n\nWith a $3,400 mortgage, a $600 car payment, and significant deductions from his paycheck for things like a 401(k), the couple may be cash-strapped due to poor planning, not just his vices.\n\n“You’re making $8,000 a month take-home pay and you have a $3,000 house payment. You are not out of food because he spent 750 bucks,” Ramsey said. “You are going to be out of food if he loses his job because he stays drunk all the time.”\n\nSee Also: Put professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds.",

    "fullText": "A coffee shop in Garden Grove is serving up more than just lattes.\n\nDD Café is licensed only as a coffee shop but is operating as a strip club.\n\nOn Thursday, police said 17 people were arrested at the café, but didn't give details on their charges or identities.\n\nGARDEN GROVE, Calif. - Inside DD Café in Garden Grove, the women are serving a lot more than coffee. FOX 11's undercover cameras captured female servers providing lap dances, offering private dances for cash, and telling customers they could bring alcohol inside for a fee.\n\nCity records show DD Café, located at 10552 McFadden Ave., is licensed only as a coffee shop.\n\nMytchell Mora, a former Garden Grove resident and news producer, says he raised concerns about the business multiple times over the past year, contacting the city, a nearby high school, and the school district.\n\n\"Everyone knows about it, and no one was doing anything about it,\" Mora said.\n\nMora says he is troubled by how close the business is to La Quinta High School, which is within walking distance of the café. Under the Garden Grove Municipal Code, adult entertainment businesses are prohibited within 1,000 feet of a school facility.\n\nFOX 11 visited DD Café to ask the owner about the type of business being operated. A woman inside who said she was in charge, told us the location was \"only a coffee shop,\" then asked us to leave. The owner was not available for comment.\n\nWe also reached out to the City of Garden Grove, emailing officials on Tuesday, February 3, and again on Thursday, February 5, describing the undercover footage and requesting comment. No response was received.\n\nLater that same Thursday night, the Garden Grove Police Department announced on social media that 17 people were arrested at DD Café. The business was also red-tagged, effectively ordering it closed. When asked what the red tag meant, someone in the police department told us it can be issued for a variety of reasons, including safety or code-related concerns.\n\nPolice have not released details about what the 17 individuals were arrested for, and it remains unclear what charges, if any, may be filed.\n\nResidents in the area told us they were not surprised, saying similar businesses are an open secret in the city and that more enforcement is needed.\n\nFOX 11 has requested additional information from the city and police department and will update this story as more details become available.\n\nInformation for this story came from undercover reporting by FOX 11. Interviews were also done with local residents. Information on the arrests came from the Garden Grove Police Department.",

    "fullText": "Lord Mandelson is reported to have received a five-figure taxpayer-funded payoff after he was sacked as US ambassador.\n\nThe 72-year-old is understood to have been awarded an exit payment of between £38,750 and £55,000 – the equivalent to three months’ salary from the Foreign Office – although he was axed last September, according to The Sunday Times.\n\nHe had held the role, which has the highest pay band, SCS4, in the diplomatic service of between £155,000 and £220,000 per annum, for seven months.\n\nPressure is growing on Sir Keir Starmer around his decision to appoint Lord Mandelson, although the latter’s friendship to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was well known.\n\nSir Keir claimed Lord Mandelson misled him about the depth of their friendship after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: “Peter Mandelson’s civil service employment was terminated in September 2025 in accordance with legal ad­vice and the terms and conditions of his employment.\n\n“As we have consistently said to Parliament, normal civil service HR processes were followed.\n\n“Further information will be provided to Parliament as part of the Government response to the motion passed last week which is being co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office.\n\n“A review has been instigated in light of further information that has now been revealed and the ongoing police investigation.”\n\nIt is claimed Lord Mandelson had requested a higher payout following his sacking by Sir Olly Robbins, the Foreign Office’s permanent under-secretary.\n\nFollowing the decision, negotiations were held over the payoff between the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s human resources department and Lord Mandelson’s lawyers.\n\nA No 10 source told the Press Association: “Given what we know now, Mandelson should either pay the money back or give it to a charity to support victims.”\n\nEarlier this week, Wes Streeting, Health Secretary, a potential successor to Sir Keir but someone who was friendly with Lord Mandelson before his downfall, said the peer should “certainly” hand back the money.\n\nIt is understood the payout was in line with the standard contractual arrangements for civil servants in the department.\n\nLord Mandelson has been approached by The Telegraph for comment via his lawyers.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Today co-anchor Savannah Guthrie's mom, Nancy Guthrie's neighbor spotted a key detail in aerial footage that prompted police to search the 84-year-old's roof—where they found new evidence, a camera, as Nancy remains missing.\n\n🎬 \nNancy's neighbor, Laura Gargano, told CNN that she notified police to check to see if Savannah's mom had her roof recoated, as it could lead to tips. Gargano said she noticed how clean Nancy's roof looked in aerial footage of the home.\n\n\"You see in that image, you see how white her roof is,\" the neighbor told CNN. \"The previous three weeks we had a lot of rain, so it would be normal for a roof to a be little dirty after it rains.\"\n\nBecause Garno's roof is flat, like Nancy's, it easily gets dirty. So the pristine condition of Nancy's roof seemed off. \"That's just one thing to check,\" she said.\n\nOn Feb. 1, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department (CSPD) launched a search for Nancy, describing her as a “vulnerable adult.” Savannah’s mother was last seen on the evening of Saturday, Jan. 31, at her home. The PCSD ultimately declared her Tucson residence a crime scene and determined that she had been “taken” from her residence “against her will.”\n\nLaw enforcement confirmed that the blood discovered at Nancy’s home belonged to the 84-year-old. Investigators have since returned to to Savannah's mom's home several times, including with K9 units. As of writing, Nancy had not been found after looking into multiple ransom notes and issuing video messages to the captors through Savannah and her siblings.\n\nNext: Savannah Guthrie’s Mom Nancy Update: FBI Makes Arrest After Fake Ransom Note",
