    "fullText": "Ernesto Valverde accepted that Athletic Club’s meeting with Levante on Sunday is set to be a crucial game for both sides, who find themselves in precarious positions with 22 games played.\n\nThe Zurigorri, who finished fourth in LaLiga last season, haven’t hit their usual heights during the first half of the league campaign. They sit 17 points adrift of the top four, and with just 3 points separating them from the drop zone, they face the very real threat of being dragged into the relegation battle.\n\nIn his pre-match press conference, Valverde stressed that “everything depends on one or two results.”\n\nLevante are already well and truly in that relegation fight, but could move one step closer to survival with victory at the San Mamés – and the 61-year-old warned that they are “coming back to life” after positive results since the turn of the year.\n\nHe explained: “They won against Sevilla, drew with Atlético Madrid, came back from behind against Elche, and made it very difficult for Real Madrid.\n\n“They’re a team that defends together and gets well forward, with rapid players and good passers. They’re a difficult opponent to beat. They’re very cohesive and press you well; it’s a very difficult, very uncomfortable match.”\n\nThe pressure could really mount on Valverde if Athletic Club do not emerge victorious on Sunday. The Zurigorri‘s last LaLiga win came against Atlético Madrid on 6 December, making for six league games without a win. It has been more than four years since the Basque side last went on a seven-game winless run.\n\n“The match against Levante is extremely important for us, and for them as well,” Valverde accepted.\n\n“We urgently need the win and will give everything to achieve it. Every month is crucial, and this month we have a certain type of opponent, but I’m not looking beyond this match — it’s the one that matters and where our focus is.”\n\nAthletic Club v Levante kicks off at San Mamés at 15:15 GMT on Sunday 8 February.",

    "description": "Andrei Arlovski furthered his combat sports legacy by defeating Ben Rothwell to win the BKFC heavyweight title.",
    "fullText": "Andrei Arlovski still has Ben Rothwell's number and has added another championship to his storied resume.\n\nIn the main event of BKFC: KnuckleMania 6, former UFC champ Arlovski met incoming BKFC heavyweight champ for the third time in combat sports – the first time in bareknuckle boxing. Arlovski won the first two fights in MMA and has now won the third in a different sport. The official result was a TKO stoppage due to cuts at 1:14 of Round 3.\n\nRothwell appeared more hesitant than ever before in the BKFC ring, and Arlovski took full advantage. Arlovski brought the fight to Rothwell, shoving him hard into the rigid ropes and clipping him with a few clean punches in Round 1.\n\nArlovski was quicker to the punch in Round 2 as well, opening up a nasty cut. In the closing seconds, Arlovski charged forward with a brutal combination, sending Rothwell reeling into the ropes. He didn't go down, but was clearly hurt from the accurate right hands.\n\nBefore the start of the third round, the referee had the doctor check on Rothwell, but the action continued. Rothwell struggled to deal with Arlovski's speed and accuracy. The fight was paused with less than a minute to go in the round so the doctor could take another look at the gashes on Rothwell's face – and that's where it would end.\n\nAndrei Arlovski makes it 3-0 in combat sports vs. Ben Rothwell, this time to claim the BKFC heavyweight title at age 47. #KM6\n\n🎥 @bareknucklefc pic.twitter.com/R6Q39G9CG4\n\n— MMA Junkie (@MMAJunkie) February 8, 2026\n\nThe pair first met in MMA at Affliction 1 in July 2008. Arlovski won that meeting by TKO in the third round. The rematch took place at UFC on ESPN 4 over a decade later. Once again, Arlovski got his hand raised, that time by unanimous decision.\n\nArlovski, 47, has not lost in competition since exiting the UFC in 2024. Since, he's won four total fights by stoppage; two in BKFC, one in Dirty Boxing Championship, and an exhibition boxing bout under the Misfits Boxing banner.\n\nRothwell, 44, ripped through the competition in BKFC after his UFC exit. He claimed the heavyweight title in his fourth fight by stopping Mick Terrill in just 36 seconds last January. However, his fantastic run came to a halt at the knuckles of a familiar foe.\n\nAndrei Arlovski def.

    "fullText": "Trent Perry scored 23 points, including clutch free throws down the stretch, Tyler Bilodeau overcame foul trouble to score 19, Donovan Dent had 17 points and 10 assists and Eric Dailey Jr. scored 14 as UCLA held off Washington 77-73 Saturday night in a Big Ten clash at Pauley Pavilion.\n\nAhead of a pivotal Midwest trip to No. 2 Michigan and No. 10 Michigan State starting on Valentine's Day, the Bruins wrapped up their three-game homestand on a positive note after splitting the first two, a one-point, double-overtime loss to Indiana followed by a 22-point blowout of Rutgers in which five players scored in double digits.\n\nThe Bruins (17-7, 9-4) struggled against Washington much as they did in the teams’ first meeting Dec. 3 in Seattle, when they escaped with an 82-80 victory thanks to 25 points (including six three-pointers) by Skyy Clark, who has sat out the past 10 games with a hamstring injury.\n\nA winner in 10 of its last 14 games, UCLA will not host its next game until a Feb. 21 matchup with fifth-ranked Illinois.\n\nWesley Yates III scored 12 of the Huskies’ first 16 points as they built an eight-point lead in the first eight minutes. The Bruins pulled ahead 25-23 on Perry’s three pointer with 6:15 left in the half that capped a 9-0 run, but Washington carried a 34-30 lead to the locker room — the first time UCLA trailed at halftime since its loss at Ohio State on Jan. 17.\n\nBilodeau, who scored only four points in the first 20 minutes, hit a three pointer 10 seconds into the second half and added another to tie the score at 38. Dent stole the ball at midcourt and drove for a layup to put UCLA in front 47-45 with 13:43 remaining and the Bruins gradually increased the lead while holding the Huskies without a field goal for nearly five minutes.\n\nWashington crept to within 60-58 with 5:39 left on a layup by Yates before Bilodeau’s basket and free throw restored a five-point cushion at the 4:40 mark. Dent’s driving layup made it 67-60 with 1:33 left and the Bruins improved to 13-3 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nYates finished with 21 points and Hannes Steinbach added 13 for the Huskies (12-12, 4-9), who cut their deficit to two on a layup and free throw by Yates with 23 seconds left. Dailey got fouled and made both shots to make it 75-71 with 21 ticks left. After a layup by Yates with 11 seconds left, Perry sank two free throws to ice the victory four seconds later.\n\nThe Bruins were 23 of 29 at the foul line and remain on pace to break the school single-season record for best free throw percentage (75.6) set in 1978-79.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers rallied back for a win on the road against the Sacramento Kings. They can thank their new backcourt for this one.\n\nAll grades are based on our usual expectations for each player.\n\n35 points, 4 assists, 2 rebounds, 2 steals, 2 blocks\n\nMitchell took a backseat in the first half as his new co-star took his turn learning the offense. But in the second half, Don understood it was his time to be aggressive. He began windmilling and bombarding the Kings from all areas of the floor.\n\nMitchell had 6 points at the half, then scored 12 points in the third quarter, and 17 points in the fourth to finish with a game-high 35 points.\n\n23 points, 8 assists, 2 rebounds\n\nIt’s tough to join a team midseason and immediately find your groove. This started as a feel-out game if I’ve ever seen one. Harden did an excellent job running Cleveland’s pick-and-roll, but it took some time for him to be start scoring the rock.\n\nTravis Scott crashed James Harden and Donovan Mitchell's postgame interview after the Cavs win 😭\n\n pic.twitter.com/5mgfMWEzEf\n\n— Kurrco (@Kurrco) February 8, 2026\n\nHarden officially welcomed himself to the Cavaliers by pouring in 15 points in the fourth quarter. He and Mitchell combined for a whopping 32 points in the final frame, escaping Sacramento with a win (and delivering a Travis Scott endorsement with him).\n\nWe’ve partnered with Homage to help provide Cavs fans with the best gear. Anything bought from the links below helps support Fear the Sword while also allowing you to rep the Cavs. You can also shop all Homage Cavs gear HERE.\n\nYou can grab the Mobley shirt seen above HERE.\n\nThe Mobley trading card shirt can be bought HERE.\n\n29 points, 10 rebounds, 1 assist\n\nProps to Allen. He’s not only carried additional weight with Evan Mobley on the sidelines, but he’s found a new pick-and-roll partner in Harden who can get him more involved than ever before. This was an awesome glimpse at a two-man game that I can’t wait to watch develop. Allen shot 11-12 tonight, starting the game 11-11.\n\n10 points, 0 assists, 6 rebounds, 3 turnovers\n\nA lot was going on in this game. Tyson never found his role in it all. He finished with a minus-27 in nearly 30 minutes. That’s tough to do in a game you won.\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\n6 points, 3 rebounds, 3 assists, 3 steals, 1 block, 17 minutes\n\nI would have liked more Ellis in this game. His defensive playmaking and three-point shooting are skills that fit any lineup. Kenny Atkinson eventually decided he agreed, closing this game with Ellis.\n\n6 points, 5 rebounds, 2 assists\n\nTomlin is still getting ignored by opposing defenses. That led to some clunky spacing in his minutes. But, as is the story of the season, his energy and activity keep Tomlin as one of the team’s highest plus/minus players. He finished as a plus 16 tonight.\n\n7 points, 4 assists, 3 rebounds\n\nSchroder’s scrappy style is going to fit right in with Cleveland’s bench. He had a few instances of tunnel vision (3-9 shooting) tonight. Other than that, Schroder was a serviceable backup guard.\n\nMerrill has done a lot to earn some benefit of the doubt when he has a poor shooting night. He’s usually able to be effective even when his shots aren’t falling. But I don’t think anything was working for Sam tonight. He finished 0-6 from the floor.\n\n4 points, 4 assists, 3 rebounds, 2 steals\n\nThis wasn’t a great game for Porter. His lack of shooting can be crippling on the offense when his defense isn’t making up for it. He contributed as a playmaker and even swiped a few steals, but Porter was overall too out of place for me to feel good about his performance.\n\n10 points, 3 rebounds, 2 assists\n\nBryant nailed back-to-back three-pointers in the first half. After that, his mobility became a serious liability for the Cavaliers’ defense. It is what it is. We knew this was a limitation for TB.",

Arlovski battered Rothwell to the point where the doctor stepped in to stop it after a nasty cut was opened on Rothwell’s head.\n\nCheck out the ending of the fight below.\n\nOMG that cut is NASTY!#KM6 pic.twitter.com/t3SHSVz5tK\n\n— DAZN Combat Sports (@DAZNCombat) February 8, 2026\n\nFrom the opening bell, Arlovski delivered on his word on being the quicker fighter, landing his jab at will. Anytime Rothwell got close, he got hit by Arlovski. At one point, Arlovski hit Rothwell with a big right hand that sent Rothwell staggering across the ring to win a clear round.\n\nThe impressive performance continued into the second, where it was all Arlovski, who almost got a knockdown at the end of the second, but the ropes kept Rothwell standing. Still, Rothwell was starting to considerably wear the damage.\n\nArlovski continued to carve up Rothwell’s face in the third, where the fight was stopped 1:14 into the round.\n\nIn the co-main event, light heavyweight champ Lorenzo Hunt destroyed middleweight champion David Mundell in a non-title, champ vs. champ matchup, scoring a brutal knockout in the fourth round.

    "fullText": "The Cleveland Cavaliers took over in the fourth quarter to win a thriller in Sacramento. Let’s see who won and lost the night.\n\nThis one came down to the wire. That’s in part because of Sacramento’s lights-out shooting and Cleveland’s poor rebounding. But when push came to shove, the Cavs had two stars they could turn to.\n\nDonovan Mitchell and James Harden combined for 32 points in the fourth quarter, just when the team needed it most. It was devastating shot after devastating shot, as Mitchell got the ball rolling before Harden buried the Kings with his three-point shooting.\n\nThis wasn’t seamless. Mitchell and Harden took turns dicing up the Kings in a game where they might have led earlier if they had more synergy between each other. But hey, it’s their first game together. It took both Mitchell and Harden a few quarters to find each other’s groove. But with one prolific quarter, we saw how special this duo can be.\n\nThere’s a new maestro in town, and he has a big fuzzy beard.\n\nHarden is one of the best playmakers in the NBA. That’s something you probably already knew. But until you see him in a Cavs uniform dishing the ball to some of your favorite players — you don’t really understand just how great he is.\n\nThis wasn’t anything incredible. Harden finished with 23 points and 8 assists. But he consistently delivered the ball to his teammates in the pick-and-roll. Harden was finding them on their way to the rim, whether it be Jarrett Allen, Jaylon Tyson, or Craig Porter.\n\nHarden’s instincts as a 6’5” dimer give this offense a new wrinkle. He shredded Sacramento’s attempts at trapping him, showing supreme poise in accepting the pressure and then getting the ball out at precisely the right time. He’s a basketball savant who is now surrounded by connective passers and competent play finishers.\n\nThe Cavaliers have always, in my opinion, been at their best when the offense is leading the charge. Sure, they’ve had the backbone of a defensive team for years, but it’s their offensive explosions that took them from good to great last season.\n\nGetting back to that level hasn’t been easy. Injuries and poor shooting held them back early in the season. But now? They have a brand new engine that’s ready to get them burning rubber again.\n\nI’ll cut the Cavs a little bit of slack. You can’t always control when the other team has an outlier night shooting the ball. For example, Russell Westbrook and Nique Clifford are shooting below 35% from deep this season, yet they combined for 9-13 shooting in the first three quarters.\n\nNo one else on the Kings had more than one three-pointer entering the fourth quarter. That’s tough.\n\nWestbrook and Clifford’s outlier nights almost single-handedly kept the Kings in this one. But I can’t completely dismiss this as poor shooting luck for the Cavs. After all, it’s their job to contest and limit shots. Especially once an opponent is in a rhythym.\n\nCleveland’s rotations were a step slow tonight. Their defensive rebounding was also an issue, as the Kings had 15 offensive rebounds. Tighter rotations and a better effort on the glass would have cleaned up a handful of the open three-point attempts Sacramento generated.\n\nSpeaking of Harden’s passing in the pick-and-roll, let’s talk about the player who will benefit the most from the Beard’s arrival.\n\nAllen is going to be living in paradise for the foreseeable future. It felt like he received a paint touch on every screen he set for Harden, often catching the ball with enough space to go straight up for a layup. That’s a testament to Harden’s threat as a scorer, as the Kings spent more time worrying about him than covering Allen’s roll.\n\nBut I don’t want to give Harden all of the credit.\n\nWe’ve seen that Allen can be a crafty and creative finisher around the rim. Getting the ball to him in the short roll is one part of the equation. From there, we saw Allen score using his post-hook, drop-step, and up-and-under move.\n\nAllen finished with 29 points, 10 rebounds, and didn’t miss on his first 11 shot attempts.\n\nThe Cavs have leaned on Allen heavily with Evan Mobley on the sidelines. He’s taken more offensive responsibility in stride and deserves all the credit in the world for holding down the fort.",

    "fullText": "As Drake Maye prepares for the biggest game of his life, one of the most unexpected storylines of his Super Bowl run has nothing to do with football. It has everything to do with his wife, Ann Michael Maye.\n\nOver the past year, Ann Michael has quietly become a fan favorite, known for her warm personality, baking content, and behind-the-scenes support of her husband. What started as casual social media posts and lighthearted moments has now grown into something much bigger, a spotlight she never asked for, but has embraced with grace.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Super Bowl LX, Maye admitted he’s been amazed by how quickly fans have connected with her.\n\n“I’m more surprised at how much people have embraced my wife,” Maye said. “It’s been so cool to see her story and what it’s been like for her.” These days, the quarterback finds himself playing second fiddle in public.\n\n“She’s the one out at restaurants having to take pictures,” Maye joked. “And I’m the one laughing in the back.”\n\nAnn Michael’s rise in popularity has been gradual but genuine. Long before Maye became a Super Bowl quarterback, she was already earning fans through her baking videos, family moments, and down-to-earth presence online. Supporters were drawn to her authenticity, a refreshing contrast to the polished image often associated with pro athletes’ partners. Now, that connection has reached another level.\n\n“At games, walking around the stadium, it’s awesome for her,” Maye said. “She’s getting bombarded.” Rather than feeling overwhelmed, he sees it as something meaningful. “That’s really special for the fan base,” he added, “and for us to share the same journey and be in the spotlight together.”\n\nFor Maye, having his wife alongside him through this rapid rise has made the experience more grounding than stressful. While Ann Michael has been winning over fans, Maye remains focused on the task at hand: facing a fast, disciplined Seattle defense in the Super Bowl.\n\n“They’re fast. They play as a team,” he said. “You can tell they’re well coached. They do things the right way.” He made it clear that Seattle has earned its reputation. “They’ve earned the respect of the league,” Maye said. “It’s a tough challenge, but I know our locker room has responded all year.”\n\nThat confidence reflects the maturity Maye has shown throughout the postseason. Despite the pressure, he has rarely looked rattled, relying on preparation and trust in his teammates. When asked about his approach to such a massive game, Maye emphasized simplicity over spectacle.\n\n“Keep it simple,” he said. “Sometimes it’s just about not turning the ball over.” He credited head coach Josh McDaniels for helping him stay grounded. “Coach is so good about understanding how the game’s going,” Maye explained. “The weather, the flow, everything.”\n\nSome nights call for explosive numbers. Others demand patience.\n\n“Sometimes you throw for 350,” Maye said. “Sometimes you just protect the ball. And you end up going to the Super Bowl.” Stats, he insists, are secondary. “We’re not worried about that,” he concluded. “We’re worried about winning.”\n\nThe post “She’s Getting Bombarded”: Drake Maye Raves About Ann Michael Maye Factor Before Super Bowl appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "title": "On This Day (8 Feb 1936): Sunderland Do Their Fallen Teammate Proud",
    "description": "Back in action after the death of Jimmy Thorpe, professionalism helped pay tribute to a departed colleague…",
    "fullText": "With a sixth Football League championship confirmed, 1936 should have been a time of pure joy at Sunderland AFC, but the Lads’ title win will always be marked by a massive sense of sadness due to the tragic loss of popular team member Jimmy Thorpe just weeks before the trophy was handed over.\n\nSuccess was eventually confirmed midway through April, yet at this stage any thoughts of glory were secondary following the tragic news of Thorpe’s death on the fifth — just four days after his final appearance — amid a bruising encounter against Chelsea during which the rough treatment he sustained led to complications with his diabetes.\n\nA brave and extremely talented goalkeeper, Thorpe had been admitted to Monkwearmouth and Southwick Hospital after the weekend of the game.\n\nHe’d left Roker Park following the match, the closing stages of which saw him appear to be dazed and having to lean against his posts in order to remain upright, and spent the immediate hours afterwards in his bed. By Wednesday, several supporters had made inquiries to the hospital and offices of the Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette as to his condition, but at around 14:00, he passed away surrounded by his relatives.\n\nLater that afternoon, a reserve fixture against West Stanley took place at Roker, with spectators standing bare-headed and observing a two-minute period of silence prior to kick off.\n\nThe players, meanwhile, wore black ‘armlets’ although the first team squad weren’t present as they were already en route to Southport to prepare for their next game. The severity of his illness had only been brought to the attention of the travelling party at lunchtime, at which point the group sent a telegram to Thorpe’s wife expressing hope that their great mate would soon recover.\n\nRemarkably, and despite the understandable grief, there appears to have been no suggestion that the next game at Liverpool was to be postponed.\n\nThings moved quickly, with the coroner opening the inquest into Thorpe’s passing less than 24 hours after his death, and whilst that was soon adjourned the players were still expected to carry on as if nothing had happened.\n\nMatt Middleton — who was initially brought to the club in 1934 when Thorpe had spent time in Sunderland Royal Infirmary — was drafted back into the starting eleven for his first senior outing in over a year, and in bitterly cold conditions at Anfield, the Lads found themselves in the difficult position of having to focus on their football despite having had little time to come to terms with the heartache.\n\nLining up for the hosts was defender Jim Harley, who as well as being a footballer was a successful sprinter.\n\nAlthough he’d won that year’s famous Powderhall Handicap race (running under a pseudonym), it was the visitors that came flying out of the blocks, going ahead after two minutes when Bobby Gurney jumped on a mishit back pass and put the ball away.\n\nThe error owed something to the slippery surface and that continued to impact play, with Jack Balmer soon wasting a golden opportunity to level things up when he blasted wide from a few yards out. Sunderland however were able to keep their balance slightly more, and scored again from a superb Bert Davis corner, with Patsy Gallacher placing an inch-perfect header into the net.\n\nAs if fuelled by their pain, the Lads kept the pressure on at 0-2 and wrapped things up midway through the first half.\n\nA flowing move saw Jimmy Connor and Raich Carter moving possession out wide, and from there Davis played another excellent cross into the box to be knocked down by Gallacher and turned in by Gurney. The finish itself was simple but the timing of the run and the buildup play made this a superb goal and a suitable tribute to Thorpe, who was again remembered through black armbands.\n\nMiddleton, although thankful for a Tom Morrison clearance off the line and to see a Vic Wright effort hit the post, had a relatively easy time of it and it was his opposite number Arthur Riley that was the busier, even after the break when Sunderland went into a more conservative mode.\n\nA late knock to Jimmy Clark forced a bit of a reshuffle with the centre half playing out the final minutes out on the wing, yet the players drew together once more and saw things out — the clean sheet not only honouring Thorpe’s memory but that of Sunderland great Charlie Thomson, who’d also passed away in the week (Thursday 6 February).\n\nA photograph of Scotland defender Thomson, who spent a period running the Wheatsheaf pub close to where the Stadium of Light now stands following his retirement and was subsequently buried at Mere Knolls Cemetery, was included on the front page of Saturday evening’s Football Echo alongside a set of results and tables that showed Sunderland at the Division One summit, their lead being extended to seven points due to chasers Derby County and Huddersfield Town both failing to win.\n\nGlory was clearly on the horizon but at this moment, the Lads just wanted to pay tribute to their mate.\n\nSunderland 3 (Gurney 2’, 21’, Gallacher 18’)\n\nSunderland: Middleton, Morrison, Hall; Thomson, Clark, Hastings; Davis, Carter, Gurney; Gallacher, Connor",

    "description": "“It is now eight away games without a win on the road, and while our home form is imperious, the formula to get three points on the road needs to be found”, writes James Nickels.",
    "fullText": "This is a really difficult game to unpack — for large parts we competed as equals with arguably the best team in world football, yet the scoreline reads a 3-0 loss. A third away loss in which we have conceded three.\n\nWhile two of Arsenal’s goals contained pieces of genuinely top-quality play, for the most part, we limited them to a number of small chances, with each side’s xG pretty similar (1.02 v 1.03). I don’t really care for xG; it is a quantitative metric that can hardly be realistically quantified — what the hell does it actually mean in real-world terms? But here it is a useful barometer. We barely gave them real chances in earnest, and barely had any ourselves.\n\nOmar Alderete was suspect for both goals — the first emanated from a poor giveaway in his own defensive third, and he looked to have allowed Viktor Gyökeres far too much space as he scored the second, yet I really find it difficult to actually blame him for either. That finish from Martin Zubimendi quite literally hit the one part of the goal (or post) that would actually lead to a goal, and Leandro Trossard (the Premier League’s premium underrated player) created the second with a world-class through ball.\n\nThe third, while an effective counter-attack, came purely from us pushing to score, and immediately after what I thought was a penalty for Saliba dragging down Dan Ballard to the ground with both of his arms. It was an undeserved result which flatters the hosts. Yet, regardless of that, their quality shone through. Many of their players are truly world-class in their passing range and shooting that was shown on the day, and trying to break that defence is like just hitting a brick wall after some promising interplay in the middle of midfield.\n\nMany of us had hope, but probably very few actually thought we would win today. Arsenal seem to be picking up momentum and are one of the most well-drilled teams I’ve seen in a long time. They look formidable in defence and manage to find a way through stubborn defences.\n\nWe created probably just one real chance ourselves — Brian Brobbey’s potentially-going-wide shot in the first ten minutes, which was cleared off the line, but still looked to be quite competitive in midfield, defence and from set pieces. Brobbey himself battled well all afternoon, getting the best of William Saliba, annoying the hell out of every Arsenal fan in the stadium and had the league’s most physical, dominant force bouncing off him from Enfield to Islington. Yet again, we sit here after another x-goals-to-three loss.\n\nThere were some very strong performances throughout the side; Nordi Mukiele and Reinildo got the better of their wingers for the most part, Robin Roefs and Dan Ballard were dominant in the air, and others further up battled and linked up well. Yet we didn’t do much in attack. Arsenal’s goals were all genuine quality, but also all felt a bit soft. It’s been a weird afternoon of oxymorons. A good performance, yet a poor result. A promising day, yet another loss on the road.\n\nAgain, we stopped their set-piece threat. Arsenal’s 0.19 xG from set-pieces is their second-lowest in a game this season (the lowest was us at the SoL). And again, I apologise for the use of xG, but in a baffling afternoon, where I’m actually not absolutely fuming that we just lost 3-0, and probably quite enthused by our overall performance, it is helping provide clarity.\n\nOne positive from the day was the late introduction of Nilson Angulo, who did not look out of place at all. He came on and played on the right wing to see the game out and looked bright in spells. What was mostly self-evident, though, was his willingness to defend, track back and physicality in challenges. Something that always eluded Simon Adingra during his time on Wearside, and a non-negotiable for Régis Le Bris.\n\nWhat is self-evident is that we are not getting relegated. But if we really want to dream big and aim for Europe, this away form must be rectified. Missing Xhaka is an enormous factor, with 50% of the away games in which we have conceded three or more all coming during his absence, but it is bigger than that. It is now eight away games without a win on the road, and while our home form is imperious, the formula to get three points on the road needs to be found.\n\nBut if we put in this type of overall performance at home to Liverpool on Wednesday, I’d be pretty confident of finding a result.",

    "fullText": "Last night (Sat., Feb. 7, 2026), Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) returned home to the Meta APEX in Las Vegas, Nevada for UFC Vegas 113. Luckily, the first “Fight Night” event of 2026 was a step up from the average APEX affair. There were intriguing bouts booked throughout the evening featuring some quality prospects and familiar faces alike. The night kicked off with a couple impressive comebacks on the “Prelims,” and the action remained high throughout the evening, almost all the way to the pivotal Bantamweight main event.\n\nLet’s take a look back over the best performances and techniques of the evening:\n\nI’m having a tough time making heads or tails of Mario Bautista vs. Vinicius Oliveira.\n\nUndoubtedly, it’s a great performance and win from Bautista, who pretty much dominated the fight and won a main event without taking any hard punches to the face. There’s no question he brought a smart game plan and excellent transitional work to the cage with him, getting Oliveira to play his game and then quickly showing himself the finer man in that aspect.\n\nAll the questions surround “Lokdog.” The Brazilian made the bizarre decision of shooting just seconds into the fight against the man known to be the better grappler? Then continued to proactively wrestle? Weirder yet, Oliveira is known for his deep gas tank. He’s made a UFC career out of outlasting opposition, taking their best punches and/or takedowns early and then drowning them later.\n\nBeing an absurdly gifted athlete is Oliveira’s whole thing.\n\nIn this fight, conversely, Oliveira was exhausted just a minute into round two … and he didn’t really do that much in the first! I cannot help but think that his absurd weight cut severely drained him and robbed us of a more competitive fight. If that’s the case, it’s high time for “Lokdog” to either figure out how to cut in a healthier fashion or make the move up to 145 pounds.\n\nFor the second time in three months, 35-year-old Kyoji Horiguchi absolutely styled on a top-ranked Flyweight contender.\n\nSeriously, Horiguchi beat the brakes off Albazi and made it look pretty easy. Despite a clear size advantage and decorated wrestling pedigree, Albazi couldn’t floor Horiguchi a single time. He was forced to chase after the Karateka, and it did not at all go well for him. Horiguchi’s timing and movement patterns are so unlike everybody else that the Japanese striker was routinely able to line up hard shots that Albazi didn’t see coming and was forced to just absorb.\n\nThe damage built up quickly, and by the end of the fight, Albazi was covered in blood and had been rocked badly on multiple occasions. The finish didn’t materialize, but this was one-way traffic from pretty much the first bell.\n\nIn particular, Horiguchi’s lead hand looked great here. His jab repeatedly interrupted Albazi’s would-be pressure and stood him up tall, leaving him more vulnerable to follow-up right hand swings. As Albazi changed his guard to adjust for the jab, Horiguchi started sitting down behind wide counter left hooks that clipped the temple and did major damage.\n\nThe Flyweight division is hot right now with multiple options for champion Joshua Van’s first title defense. Given Horiguchi’s age and overall accomplishments as a world-class champion, I’m in favor of booking “The Karate Kid” for a title shot quickly while he’s still performing at such a high level — there’s no chance Van vs. Horiguchi wouldn’t be absolute fireworks.\n\nJailton Almeida vs. Rizvan Kuniev was a horribly frustrating fight but not entirely for the reason one might expect.\n\nBased on his pair of fights with Curtis Blaydes and Almeida, Kuniev was genetically engineered in a Russia lab to shut down the takedown attempts of elite Heavyweight wrestlers. Sadly, he was not engineered to do anything else. In this fight, Kuniev routinely shut down Almeida’s previously unstoppable double leg with absolute ease and then proceeded to do NOTHING! He spent so much time in the clinch with his forehead driven up into Almeida’s chin in perfect position to rip the liver, dig knees, break with elbows or right hands and a vast majority of the time he just … stayed there.\n\nAlmeida wasn’t much better. In the second round, for example, he landed a big calf kick that nearly knocked Kuniev to the floor and then proceeded to never throw that kick again. His right hand and front kick looked good when he threw them, which was incredibly rare. Worse yet, he would randomly just back himself into the fence and concede long periods of clinch time.\n\nKuniev picked up the nod, which is a big win if you look at the rankings and completely meaningless if you actually watched the fight. After those 15 minutes, who f—king cares about the judges’ scorecards? This was truly awful Heavyweight fighting just one week after the Tuivasa vs. Teixeira embarrassment at UFC 325. This division has never been worse, and there is no rebuild happening.\n\nVeteran referee Dan Miragliotta celebrated his 500th appearance as a UFC ref last night in appropriate fashion: with a hilariously bad stoppage!\n\nDustin Jacoby vs. Julius Walker was a decent veteran vs. prospect scrap. Jacoby was clearly the better kickboxer by a significant margin and was sticking Walker with good straight punches, but Walker showed in the first round why he was a live dog with some powerful slam takedowns. It was a good display of chain wrestling and physicality from the young talent, attributes we don’t often see at 205 pounds.\n\nStill, Jacoby was a step too far for the up-and-comer. Jacoby connected on a big right hand early in the second and then unleashed hell, putting Walker down hard with another right. Miragliotta moved in to stop the fight, pulled away at the last second, and Walker was hit another couple dozen times for his indecision. Even when Walker was turning away from the punches — a clear sign referees are supposed to look for that indicates the fight is over — Miragliotta still allowed the 7-2 professional to eat more punches.\n\nAnother good performance from Jacoby, who has won four straight, and exactly what we’ve come to expect from everyone’s favorite hallucinating referee.\n\nNikolay Veretennikov defeats Niko Price via first-round knockout (highlights): I am sad to say Price appears to be completely washed. Veretennikov entered this fight with an underwhelming 1-3 UFC record and then looked like a world beater against “The Hybrid.” He chewed up Price’s midsection with some violent clinch knees then went upstairs with a barrage of right hands and right elbows to secure a dramatic standing knockout win. Given that this is Price’s third straight defeat and fifth loss in his last six, it’s hard to really be that impressed by Veretennikov.\n\nJakub Wiklacz defeats Muin Gafurov via third-round guillotine choke (highlights): We have an early candidate for Submission of the Year, and it came at the conclusion of a pretty great scrap! Gafurov started strong, pressuring forward with combinations to box up Wiklacz, who has a definite bit of Reinier de Ridder to his stand-up game (derogatory). He’s very slick on the canvas, however, and Wiklacz used a guillotine choke to reverse his way into top position in round two. He spent most of that frame in top position, threatening submissions and landing some chipping ground shots. With the scorecards tied up, Gafurov stuck to his boxing and really ripped up the body for most of five minutes. In the closing seconds, he shot for a double leg along the fence and wound up in another guillotine! Wiklacz fully committed to the squeeze and forced the tap with less than one second remaining, earning the unlikely comeback at the last second. Strange style or not, Wiklacz is now 2-0 in the UFC with a pair of wins over pretty damn good Bantamweights.",

    "fullText": "A controversial livestreamer has been barred from attending PGA Tour events indefinitely after being removed from the Waste Management Phoenix Open, a person familiar with the matter told the Guardian, though the tour has declined to publicly confirm any specific disciplinary action.\n\nSecurity and law enforcement removed Jack Doherty from the tournament grounds on Friday after he appeared to pay a spectator to shout during a player’s pre-shot routine, according to videos circulating online and accounts of the incident.\n\n“The WM Phoenix Open is a bucket-list event with one of the most unique fan experiences in all of sport,” a PGA Tour spokesperson said. “The PGA Tour and the Thunderbirds are committed to protecting the integrity of the competition and providing an exceptional experience for all fans. Disruptive fan behavior will not be tolerated and anyone violating the Fan Code of Conduct is subject to immediate ejection.\n\n“We appreciate the swift action of tournament security and local law enforcement to identify and address disruptive behavior.”\n\nDoherty, a 22-year-old streamer known for filming confrontational public pranks, with titles including “I crashed into a cop car” and “I got banned from Disney”, has amassed an enormous online following through high-energy stunt and reaction livestreams, content that platform algorithms often amplify because it generates strong engagement through confrontation, shock and unpredictability.\n\nHe was removed from the tournament grounds after appearing to encourage a spectator to shout as the golfer Mackenzie Hughes addressed the ball from a fairway bunker in exchange for money, according to videos circulating on social media and accounts shared online. Security staff quickly moved in to identify those involved and remove them from the area.\n\nSome outlets and social media posts later claimed Doherty had been issued a lifetime ban from PGA Tour events. The tour has not publicly confirmed the scope or duration of any restriction.\n\nHughes later suggested the interruption had little lasting impact, saying security responded quickly and that while such moments are unwelcome, crowd behavior at the Phoenix Open has occasionally tested the boundaries of golf’s traditional etiquette.\n\nFootage circulating online also appeared to show a tournament official informing Doherty that he would not be permitted to attend PGA Tour events for the foreseeable future.\n\nThe Waste Management Phoenix Open, staged annually at TPC Scottsdale and golf’s best-attended tournament by some distance, is widely considered one of the most raucous stops on the PGA Tour calendar. Much of that reputation is tied to the stadium-style 16th hole, where thousands of well-lubricated fans pack grandstands in an atmosphere closer to a football game than a traditional golf outing.\n\nThe event has long marketed itself as the sport’s most fan-friendly tournament, with music, hospitality zones and festival-style crowds spread across the course. Organizers have tightened fan-management measures in recent years after previous editions saw spikes in crowd-related incidents, including in 2024 when gates were temporarily closed and alcohol sales briefly halted because of overcrowding.\n\nThe episode underscores a broader challenge facing professional sports leagues as venues balance open fan access with an era in which spectators can instantly broadcast and monetize interactions from inside events. While fan filming has long been common, some leagues have begun reviewing policies around livestreaming, harassment and behavior designed specifically to generate viral content.\n\nThe shift has surfaced elsewhere in professional sport, including recent incidents at WNBA games in which sex toys were thrown onto the court, prompting league warnings and security reviews.\n\nIt remains unclear whether any tournament-specific or tour-wide restrictions beyond the reported ban have been formally issued, or whether Doherty could attempt to attend future events in another capacity, such as through hospitality or third-party access.\n\nThe PGA Tour and tournament organizers have not indicated whether any additional guidance or security measures will be introduced following the incident. The general manager for the Waste Management Phoenix Open did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Guardian.",

    "description": "Nick Russell, Jaxsen Jean claim two of Panthers' six titles at Bloomington Regional; OV sends record 8 to semi-state.",
    "fullText": "Last year, Bloomington South junior Jaxsen Jean won a sectional wrestling title at 106 pounds while sophomore Nick Russell was king at 113, only for both to get beat in the regional finals. For Jean, it was a repeat of his freshman season.\n\nSo this year, they traded places and boom, both came out as champions at the Bloomington South Regional on Saturday, Feb. 7.\n\nJean has grown into a 113 body while Russell said he was 104 pounds last year competing at 113, so bulking up and cutting weight has been to his advantage at 106.\n\nMore: Bloomington South girls basketball repeats as sectional champs\n\n\"I think it has been,\" Russell said. \"It's definitely been a lot harder to get down to (106), but if I went (106) I'd have a better shot of getting to state and so far, it's working out.\"\n\nThey're drill partners, along with freshman Josiah Stanton, the 120 champ, and not surprisingly, they're having great seasons.\n\n\"We're helping each other a lot,\" Russell said. \"We go at it every day in the room. We hit drills hard. This week, I had Jaxsen pretend that he was Hunter (Pierson) and do the stuff that Hunter did.\n\n\"Some days, we go back and forth, but (Jean) usually gets the better of me. He works really well on his feet on defense. I get shots on him all the time, but I can't finish them.\"\n\n\"He shoots a lot,\" Jean added. \"At the beginning of the year, I struggled with a sprawl, and he started shooting on me a lot in practice and helped me get my sprawl better. I can help him with a lot of positions, he's not very good at and we just help each other.\"\n\nAll 11 Panthers who qualified for regional kept their seasons alive, including Brian Conley, who is making his senior year something special at 138 with back-to-back postseason titles.\n\nIn workman like fashion, he put together to solid wins of 7-3 and 7-0 before dominating William Rader of Terre Haute South, who was on a streak, having paced fourth last week but pinning a sectional champ in just 36 in his opener. Conley buried him, with a 17-2 tech fall.\n\nMore: Bloomington South girls basketball repeats as sectional champs\n\n\"The best I've done is third for both, so it's really awesome to get first this year,\" Conley said. \"I worked really hard in the off-season, so I'm really proud of myself.\"\n\nHe saw the end of the road coming and wanted to make sure he made the most of it after just making it to semistate last year.\n\n\"I'm not really cutting any weight this year, so that's a big help,\" Conley said. \"I have a lot of pride, as a senior now, a leader. So at practice, I'm able to work much harder and being a leader and role model. I've got that, a lot of confidence and a lot of pride in my team.\"\n\nOn the mat, his experience is taking over and hopes that will really help next week, too.\n\n\"I feel like my defense, I'm able to see when shots are coming and sprawl or move out of the way and figure out what I'm going to do next,\" Conley said. \"It's been a big gamechanger.\"\n\nConley was part of an outstanding day for the Panthers, one of six regional champs.\n\nRussell (106), Jean (113), Stanton (120), Amrin Pratt (144) and Wyatt Cooksey (157) all won titles, while Denny Allgood (175) and Mason Grubb (215) were second in rematches from their sectional finals. Taking third were Jude Pratt at 126, Mark Hand at 132 and at 150, surprising Gerardo Hernandez-Ibarra in his first year of varsity action.\n\nRussell (28-6) won by pin in 5:07, Jean (32-3) and Stanton (31-2) each by 17-1 tech fall, Amrin Pratt (31-3) by 5-0 decision and Cooksey (30-3) flattened three foes by pins of 30 seconds, 3:43 and 1:32.\n\nAllgood couldn't replicate his 13-4 major from sectional against 17th ranked Noah Fields of Terre Haute South, going down in sudden victory overtime, 5-2. Grubb closed the gap on Northview's Devyn Orman, but couldn't score in a 5-0 loss.\n\nSouth won the regional title with 199½ points to top Floyd Central (101½).\n\nAs the Patriots posed, it was the biggest picture of semi-state qualifiers ever for OV, with eight topping to old mark of seven.\n\n\"Taking eight to semi-state speaks volumes about your practice room,\" OV coach Steven Spicer said. \"Those guys are training with those guys every single day. I'm super proud of them.\"\n\nSeveral made it the hard way as Reid Lanman (30-10) at 144, Luke Burner (27-12) and Braddock Nickless (25-13) at 215 all knocked off a sectional champ in the first round to punch their tickets. Burner and Nickless were third and Lanman fourth.\n\n\"We try to trade film, game-plan but ultimately, it comes down to those guys having belief in themselves,\" Spicer said. \"We talk about it all week. The postseason mentality, how you should approach each match. Don't make it bigger than it is. Enjoy the moment. All that stuff.\n\n\"And they showed up. We thought we might have a chance. But it's just belief in what we do, belief in their training.\"\n\nOV also posted two of the most dramatic victories of the day, with Collin Willen (27-11) getting a literal last-second escape against sectional champ Miguel Tedrow in the semifinals at 165 for a 1-0 win. He would take second. Nickless won his third-place match in the same exact fashion, 10-9.\n\n\"Collin, his freshman year, he was varsity for us at 190,\" Spicer said. \"He wasn't 190, but we needed one. So he's wrestled everywhere from 157 to 190 for us. He's the ultimate teammate. To finally get over that hump as regional his senior year, he's peaking at the right time.\n\n\"That's the best he's wrestled all year, today.\"\n\nIn addition to Boltinghouse and Sloan, the Patriots also saw Riley Martin (30-8) take fourth at 157.\n\nNeither North or Edgewood could crack the championship column but will each have three carry on to semistate.\n\nEdgewood had two runner-ups. At 126, senior John Orman (19-2) is headed to semi-state for a fourth time, but couldn't solve No. 25 Nolan Mullins in an 8-2 loss. At 150, senior Cayleb Stephens (19-10) is a first-time semi-state qualifier but ran into No. 12 Hunter Banet of Floyd Central in the final, suffering an 11-0 major.\n\nMore: Edgewood wrestler Cayleb Stephens has heart and more this season\n\nJunior Lincoln Getts (20-6) ended the Mustangs' day on a high note at 285, coming up with a takedown midway through the first overtime period to take his third-place match after earning his first trip to semistate.\n\nNorth is sending Hopkins, who missed last year after making it as a sophomore and Ryan Watkins (26-10), third at 113. It will be Watkins' first trip to Evansville.\n\nTedrow (32-3), a senior, bounced back from his semi loss, taking his frustrations out in a 16-0 tech fall for third to also earn a return trip.\n\nTop team scores: Bloomington South 199½; Floyd Central 101½; Terre Haute South 91; Owen Valley 84; Jasper 77½; New Albany 43; Edgewood 42; Bloomington North 40; Southridge 31; Terre Haute North 29; Tell City 24½; Northview 22; Sullivan 8.\n\nTop 4 advance to state.

    "title": "‘Winning Is The Most Important Thing’ – Danny Kingad Eager To Get Career Back On Track Against Hu Yong At ONE Fight Night 40",
    "description": "\"The King\" continues his quest for the flyweight MMA throne on February 13.",
    "fullText": "Danny “The King” Kingad was once on the cusp of flyweight gold. Now, at ONE Fight Night 40: Buntan vs. Hemetsberger on Prime Video, the Filipino veteran looks to reignite his World Title pursuit on Friday, February 13, live in U.S. primetime from Bangkok’s iconic Lumpinee Stadium.\n\nThere, Kingad faces “Wolf Warrior” Hu Yong in a crucial three-round battle between two contenders desperate to rebound.\n\nSince joining ONE in 2016, Kingad has amassed 11 victories over some of the division’s biggest names, including a 2018 win over now-reigning ONE Flyweight MMA World Champion Yuya “Little Piranha” Wakamatsu.\n\nBut their rematch at ONE 165 didn’t go his way, with the Japanese superstar earning revenge via unanimous decision. Kingad then suffered a submission loss to former ONE Flyweight MMA World Champion Adriano “Mikinho” Moraes at ONE 169, marking back-to-back defeats for the first time in his career.\n\nThe 30-year-old’s bid for redemption was put on hold as injuries and the arrival of his second child kept him sidelined throughout 2025. Now Kingad returns, the time away only sharpening his hunger for victory.\n\nThe Lions Nation MMA representative told onefc.com:\n\n“Believe it or not, I really missed getting punched in the face. I miss the adrenaline, getting a black eye in a wild fight. I just want that euphoric feeling again. It’s those little things.\n\n“I’m feeling nothing but excitement. My last two fights didn’t go according to plan, so I’m hungry to redeem myself. I am pushing myself to the limits in training because I badly want to win this fight. Winning is the most important thing for me right now.”\n\nSnapping his skid won’t be easy. Hu owns ferocious knockout victories over former divisional king Geje “Gravity” Eustaquio and Eko Roni Saputra, with fight-ending power that makes him a constant threat.\n\nKingad respects the danger but has a clear path to neutralize the trigger-happy striker.\n\n“He is a proven finisher. He has taken out a lot of big names over the years. Then again, that’s the beauty of MMA. We’re not limited to one discipline. I know how good he is with his stand-up, so why not test his ground game?\n\n“His decision losses were mostly due to his opponents controlling him with top pressure on the ground. I think I can also beat him in that area and impose my will. My conditioning is also an advantage.”\n\nThis matchup also carries unfinished business. The pair were originally scheduled to meet at ONE Fight Night 15 in 2023, but a foot injury forced Kingad to withdraw.\n\n“The King” always knew they’d meet again. At this pivotal moment in his career, the timing couldn’t be better.\n\nThe proud Igorot warrior offered:\n\n“I’m relieved and excited that the match is finally happening. I got injured the last time, so this is a chance for me to display all the improvements I’ve made. I’ll give it my all.”\n\nDanny Kingad has never been in a boring fight. His relentless motor and bottomless gas tank allow him to grind opponents down, getting stronger as rounds tick by.\n\nHis wushu background bolsters his striking precision and fluidity, while his evolving ground game gives him options to change levels at will.\n\nWhile the 30-year-old understands he needs a statement finish to prove he’s still elite, he refused to make bold proclamations against a fighter of Hu Yong’s caliber. He’s simply prepared to do whatever it takes, even if it goes the distance.\n\n“I want a finish, of course, but realistically, I see this one going the full three rounds. We’re both tough to finish, so it’s a matter of who imposes his game plan.\n\n“I’m not afraid to strike with him, but if there are openings, I will go after those takedowns. It’s just a bonus for me if I get to submit him or finish him via ground-and-pound.”\n\nKingad understands the magnitude of this moment. The margin for error is razor-thin.\n\nNow a father of two, he carries extra motivation to perform and provide. A victory on February 13 also opens the opportunity for a US$50,000 performance bonus in his comeback fight.\n\nWith both fighters hungry to bounce back from recent losses, all the ingredients point to a memorable showdown.\n\n“I’m always motivated. Especially now, the stakes are higher. I just really want to win. It’s been a while. So I won’t force it, I believe that bonus will come at the right time.\n\n“Expect that this will be an explosive fight. We’re both coming off losses, and we’re both hungry. I’m very excited to do what I do best and get my career back on track.”",

    "title": "Talking Points: Pride In Defeat For Sunderland At Arsenal",
    "description": "Ben McKevitt looks at the main stories from Sunderland’s trip to the Emirates — a mixture of good and bad!",
    "fullText": "As much as you could say that this was a continuation of some disappointing away form for the Lads, the performance was much improved in terms of intensity, ambition and composure.\n\nWhile the result was the same, this wasn’t a performance equal to those at Brentford and West Ham, wherein we slumped to lethargic and error-ridden defeats. Instead, this was the result of going away to the best team on the planet and going into battle with them on their own turf.\n\nThe scoreline reflects the overall truth that Arsenal were the better team but I’m still proud of the Lads and I think the team gave a good account of themselves across the park. These are the kinds of games that happen in the Premier League and to expect anything more than a tough, battling performance away at the Emirates would perhaps be a little unfair of the squad at this point.\n\nWe made some opportunities for ourselves, with Brian Brobbey’s early chance and Chemsdine Talbi’s effort being the most memorable. Elsewhere, Trai Hume played some excellent crosses and linked up play from his position on the right, and Habib Diarra found some driving pockets, but we couldn’t make anything land.\n\nThe unfortunate truth is that some small mistakes were punished brutally yesterday – which we also experienced in the reverse fixture.\n\nAt home, slight lapses in concentration from Enzo Le Fée and Noah Sadiki led to pin-point lashes at goal from Bukayo Saka and Leandro Trossard. Here, the same could be said of Omar Alderete and Nordi Mukiel, which led to their opening two goals.\n\nIn reality, the finish still had to be perfect for their first and the passing had to be incisive for the second, and that’s what the elite teams are both capable of and known to do.\n\nNowhere was this more obvious than in the times we didn’t quite close them down quick enough on the edge of our own box, with Kai Havertz and Declan Rice both coming close and Martin Zubimendi slotting in a ridiculously accurate effort off the post.\n\nOn this point, I’d like to offer some nuance in that while we may have been slightly delayed in closing down shots, Arsenal obviously drill these scenarios meticulously so as to create space specifically for shots on the edge of the box. It’s particularly effective because they have the ability to punish so incisively in those situations.\n\nThey have quality all over the pitch — not least of all in goal where David Raya demonstrated once again why he’s one of the best in the business.\n\nWe didn’t test him too much outside of a drilled Talbi effort, but his handling of the ball, anticipation and distribution at speed was electric and shows why you have to be on form for the full ninety against the league leaders.\n\nIt was interesting to see how aggressively we were set up yesterday, with Sunderland going man-for-man all the way up the pitch out of possession.\n\nIt often forced Raya to go long, from where Dan Ballard and Alderete could often win the first contact and earn us possession again. Arsenal are clearly an excellent team and you could see they had manoeuvres planned to counter this, with Rice dropping into his own box to leave space for Raya to pick a pass, but we did often make them work to get out.\n\nAdditionally, Habib Diarra once again impressed both in and out of possession in his “Chris Rigg” role as the second striker in our pressing 4-4-2 from last season. We know Le Bris loves this setup and clearly recruited Diarra with that specific position in mind, but it’s great to see that he fits it so perfectly.\n\nThe bravery to go man-for-man allowed us to give a much better account of ourselves on the road and gave us a chance to get something from the game — it’s just unfortunate that we couldn’t fashion any more big chances but can see why Arsenal have such an incredible defensive record.\n\nWe went to the Emirates Stadium with an aggression that we hadn’t found ourselves capable of in recent away performances. This was great to see, and in my opinion, necessary if we were to stand a chance against the battling North Londoners.\n\nThey relish a battle down there and are known for their set piece expertise, so it was good to see that we didn’t succumb to either any goals from corners while causing them huge issues from our own set plays, with one in particular nearly leading to the opener if not from an important block from Havertz. Without Raya, I could’ve also seen a few more close calls for the home side as we caused chaos in their box.\n\nA primary pillar of our physical capabilities was Brian Brobbey, who was once again immense with his back to goal and, in my opinion, let down often and predictably by the officiating.\n\nI’m not too sure why he’s not allowed to win fouls but it makes it all the more impressive that he performed so impressively against the odds — both numerically against Arsenal’s two centre halves and the referee. It’s a shame that we couldn’t get more men around Brobbey in order to advance more efficiently up the pitch, but it’s something we’re clearly working towards and improving overall.\n\nThe substitutions made by Le Bris didn’t yield any immediate results but did make for some interesting viewing, and one particularly exciting sight was that of Nilsson Angulo’s introduction in Sunderland colours — especially as it saw him attacking from the right hand side.\n\nUpon his signing, all initial signals pointed to Angulo’s abilities being most refined off the left, driving on either side of the right full back and providing passes for teammates. Yesterday, though, we saw him replace Hume on the right side (even taking the set pieces that Hume had previously been entrusted with) while Romaine Mundle retained his position on the left, replacing Talbi.\n\nIt’s a sign that Le Bris may see Angulo as the right winger we’d clearly been interested in recruiting, especially in Bertrand Traoré‘s absence both in the immediate short term and potentially beyond. Something to keep an eye on.\n\nWe didn’t get to see much of Angulo’s quality during his fifteen-minute cameo, but it’s good to see that he’s fit and trusted from the off and I’m excited to see what he can bring.\n\nMundle’s introduction in the first instance was also notable. Le Bris clearly trusts him from the left wing and I think the fact that we’ve seen Simon Adingra go out of the door while Mundle is the first substitute away against Arsenal tells you a lot about what’s happening in training.\n\nA less exciting sight, however, was that of Noah Sadiki’s exit from the pitch, replaced by Lutsharel Geertruida. It came about five minutes after he clearly felt something of a tweak in his hamstring when stretching for a ball and which was undoubtedly the reason for the substitution.\n\nSadiki very rarely comes off the pitch so although it was concerning, it’s important to note that he did play for a further five minutes after the incident and walked off without much issue, so perhaps it was just a precautionary move from Le Bris.",

    "fullText": "I don’t believe for one second that there wasn’t a single Sunderland player out there that wasn’t trying their hardest from the first minute.\n\nWhat we saw was our absolute best effort. And if that’s not good enough, well…it is what it is. Unlike against West Ham and Brentford, I think we really gave it our all but we came up against the best team walking the planet right now.\n\nNobody likes losing, but you have to be a big enough man to admit that we were just beaten by the better side, and that was the case here.\n\nArsenal are short odds to win the quadruple this season, and you can see why — they’re a relentless winning machine who can turn over even a very good side giving in their best effort, and we need to just take that as a fact and on the chin.\n\nI can bet that Gabriel and William Saliba haven’t faced anything as difficult as Brian Brobbey this season. I thought he was brilliant, and single-handedly gave them their biggest physical test of the campaign.\n\nWe got a taste of in the game at the Stadium of Light earlier in the season when Brobbey got in ahead of Gabriel for our equaliser, but yesterday they faced a fitter and stronger Brobbey, and I was really impressed with the way he played.\n\nHe’s getting better and better, and the only real criticism you could have is that he maybe could’ve done better with his chance early in the game, but that would be nit-picking. He was my pick for man of the match and I bet the Arsenal defenders will be glad they’re not playing against him again for a while.\n\nI don’t even think the three ‘mistakes’ that occurred leading to the Arsenal goals were particularly brutal, but against a team as good as Arsenal, you can’t even get away with the slightest of discrepancies.\n\nThat’s just a lesson we have to learn — you need to be perfect to get anything from a game away at the Emirates!\n\nYet another absolute clown officiated the game.\n\nSamuel Barrott was terrible, and really needs to look at the way he performed. Saliba should have been sent off for persistent fouling, he should have given a penalty after a foul from Martin Zubimendi on Dan Ballard, and Riccardo Calafiori got away with murder time after time, too.\n\nI’m getting sick of whingeing about the officials but it would be neglect if I didn’t continue to raise the issue of officials treating Brobbey and Ballard differently to other players simply because they’re physical and give as good as they get.\n\nOverall, I think we actually played quite well.\n\nThe scoreline flattered them really as I thought we stayed in the game for a good long while. We didn’t create many clear cut chances but we had more of the ball than expected and used it well at times. I got the impression that they were relieved to get the second goal and even after that, I think it was only the third goal that really killed us off.\n\nOf course, we still lost the game, but we’ve definitely played worse than that this season. Arsenal are one of the best teams in the world so there’s no shame in getting beat — especially if we actually put in a solid performance.\n\nHe made the right decision each time he got the ball and he was sharp and exciting to watch. He wasn’t on the pitch long but he gave a good first impression of himself and hopefully he can continue to integrate well with the squad and make an even bigger and better impact on the team for the remainder of the season.\n\nI was surprised to hear on the radio that our last away win was that terrific victory at Stamford Bridge in October. Since then, we’ve picked up some good points on the road against the likes of Tottenham, Liverpool and Brighton, but we haven’t been able to get all three.\n\nOur home form has been able to generate us a lot of points, meaning that poorer performances away from home haven’t left us struggling, but it would be great for our away form to improve soon.\n\nI thought the referee was really poor.\n\nBrian Brobbey and Dan Ballard hardly ever get anything from referees, but this was especially bad. Brobbey’s whole game plan is to pin and spin the defender but every time he did that, William Saliba almost had the shirt off his back and the referee gave nothing — and it’s the same with Ballard.\n\nEvery time he’s in the opposition box for a free kick or corner, there are multiple defenders surrounding him. They know how much of a threat he is and he always ends up getting dragged to the floor. If he got the treatment he gets in the box anywhere else on the pitch, it would definitely be given as a free kick.\n\nI’m aware that these interactions are hard to referee as Ballard and Brobbey are tussling with their opponent too, but it is getting more and more frustrating to see. It’s also become a recurring theme for referees to rule in favour of the “Big Six” teams and that was painfully obvious.\n\nThey’re clearly terrified of facing Mikel Arteta’s “wrath” — which is more like pathetic whinging.\n\nWe looked confident in possession and played some lovely football at times.\n\nPerhaps too much of this was deeper than the final third, but when we did progress forward, there were some intricate moves involving our creative players.\n\nAs a team, we’re growing in confidence and although we lost, we can take heart from how we took the game to Arsenal at times.\n\nIt’s been said that we don’t score enough goals, but it’s a work in progress and now we have Brian Brobbey up to full fitness and Habib Diarra back in the side, we have more of a physical and athletic threat going forward.\n\nThis is giving Enzo Le Fée and Chemsdine Talbi more options on the ball, and we’ll score plenty more goals between now and the end of the season.\n\nOmar Alderete has been superb this season but he did something I’ve been wary of for some time — made a few unforced errors.\n\nSometimes he’ll give the ball away cheaply or do something completely unexpected, such as kicking a misplaced long pass out of play.\n\nThankfully, the pros far outweigh the cons, but I’m sure he’ll be working hard to iron out those occasional flaws.\n\nWe have another big game coming up midweek and with very little room for rotation, our players will need to dust themselves down ready to go again in just a few days against Liverpool.\n\nFortunately they’ll be back at home with the red and white army in full voice to roar them on. There should be no pressure on the Lads against he current champions and I hope they have enough in the tank for another big game.\n\nThe West Ham game was pretty poor but while this was a similar score it wasn’t a similar performance at all. The Lads gave it a good go and if the early chance for Brian Brobbey had gone in, it could’ve been a very interesting game.\n\nIt was a good battle but we lost to a better team and that’s OK.\n\nWe have to remember we came up via the playoffs and we just competed better than many sides at the home of the champions-in-waiting. That can’t be written off as anything less than good progress.\n\nThe first goal needed a perfect shot masked by defenders and in off the inside of the post to give them the lead, and that was the theme of the game.\n\nThroughout the game, they had to come up with real quality to get past us and that’s a compliment to our lads.\n\nTime and again, the commentators said that wasn’t a 3-0-type loss, and the boys can take a lot from that.\n\nThe potential injury to Sadiki is a worry as the man is a total football athlete.\n\nHopefully it was precautionary and he can be back very soon.\n\nThe first goal came about due to us not closing players down, and we need to learn from this.\n\nWe may be able to trust Robin Roefs against many sides from range but at home (with the Leandro Trossard goal) and away, we gave top quality players too much space.\n\nA lesson to learn, and we will.",

    "title": "Sunderland Women’s Rising Stars: The Academy’s Bright Future",
    "description": "Sunderland has always been a hotbed of talent, and it remains so today.",
    "fullText": "There is something unmistakably Sunderland about the emergence of young footballers who carry both the weight of expectation and the ease of belonging. It is a club whose identity has always been rooted in development, in giving opportunities to those who have grown through its system, and in trusting youth not as a gamble but as a philosophy.\n\nThe women’s team, perhaps more than any other part of the club, embodies this tradition. The conveyor belt of talent that has passed through Wearside is extraordinary by any measure: England internationals, WSL champions, Lionesses legends, and players who have shaped the modern game all trace their beginnings back to Sunderland’s academy.\n\nIn the present moment, that lineage feels as alive as ever. The senior squad is increasingly dotted with teenagers and early-twenty-somethings who are not merely filling shirts but pushing for genuine involvement. Even when they are not yet regular starters, their presence on the bench is becoming more frequent, more natural, and more indicative of what is to come. It feels inevitable that these young players will soon transition from occasional substitutes to prominent features in the matchday squad, and eventually to the spine of the team.\n\nAmong the most notable names in this emerging cohort are goalkeeper Jenny Blench, defenders Chloe Paxton and Ella West, midfielder Emily Cassap and forward Niyah Dunbar, who is currently out on loan at Middlesbrough. Alongside them, one 20-year-old, Katy Watson, and two 21-year-olds, Libbi McInnes and Reanna Blades, deserve recognition for their contributions and potential, even if circumstances have limited their minutes. Together, they represent not just individual promise but the strength of a system that continues to produce footballers capable of shaping the club’s future.\n\nTo understand why their rise feels so natural, we must first appreciate the environment that has shaped them.\n\nSunderland’s academy is not merely productive; it is a hotbed of talent, a place where footballing identity is forged early and where young players are taught not only technical skill but resilience, intelligence, and a deep understanding of the game. It is an academy that has historically punched far above its financial weight, producing players who have gone on to dominate the highest levels of women’s football. That legacy is not a relic of the past; it is a living, breathing force that continues to influence the club’s trajectory.\n\nThe current generation is the latest expression of that tradition, and their stories illuminate why Sunderland’s future looks so bright.\n\nJenny Blench, the young goalkeeper increasingly seen among the substitutes, is a compelling example of what the academy does so well. Goalkeeping is a position that demands maturity, presence, and confidence — qualities that often take years to develop. Yet Blench already carries herself with a composure that belies her age. Her shot-stopping ability is sharp, instinctive, and brave, the kind of reflexive talent that cannot be taught but can certainly be nurtured. What stands out most, however, is her command of the box. Even in academy and development fixtures, she has shown a willingness to take responsibility, to claim crosses, and to organise the defensive line in front of her. These are traits that coaches value immensely, because they indicate not just technical ability but leadership potential.\n\nHer distribution, too, reflects the modern demands of the position. Sunderland’s style increasingly relies on goalkeepers who can initiate play, who can break lines with passes, and who can remain calm under pressure. Blench fits that mould. While she is still developing the consistency that comes with experience, the raw materials are unmistakable. Her presence on the bench is not symbolic; it is a sign that the coaching staff trust her, believe in her, and see her as part of the club’s long-term plan. It feels only a matter of time before she begins to accumulate more minutes, whether through cup opportunities, late-game appearances, or rotation during congested periods of the season.\n\nIn front of her, defenders Chloe Paxton and Ella West represent two different but equally exciting profiles of young talent. Paxton is a defender who plays with a maturity that suggests she has been absorbing the game for far longer than her age would imply. Her reading of play is exceptional, allowing her to anticipate danger before it fully materialises. She is the kind of defender who makes interceptions look effortless, not because the opposition are poor but because she positions herself so intelligently. Her tackling is clean, well-timed, and confident, and she has a natural ability to stay composed even when under pressure.\n\nWhat makes Paxton particularly valuable is her versatility. She is comfortable operating across the defensive line, adapting to the needs of the team and the demands of the match. This adaptability is a hallmark of Sunderland’s academy graduates, who are often trained to understand multiple roles and responsibilities. Paxton’s ability to step into different positions without losing her effectiveness makes her a manager’s dream, especially in a league where squad depth can be tested by injuries, fixture congestion, and tactical shifts.\n\nElla West, meanwhile, brings a different energy to the defensive unit. She is dynamic, athletic, and fearless, with a willingness to engage physically and a determination that stands out even in a competitive environment. West’s defensive style is proactive; she does not wait for the game to come to her but instead seeks to influence it. Her pace allows her to recover quickly, to track runners, and to support the attack when needed. She is also strong in one-on-one situations, using both her physicality and her timing to win duels.\n\nWhat sets West apart is her confidence on the ball. She is not content simply to clear danger; she wants to build play, to carry the ball forward, and to contribute to the team’s progression. This aligns perfectly with Sunderland’s evolving tactical identity, which increasingly values defenders who can initiate attacks rather than merely prevent them. West’s development trajectory suggests that she will become a key figure in this system, offering both defensive solidity and attacking impetus.\n\nIn midfield, Emily Cassap represents one of the most intriguing prospects in the squad. Midfield is often the most demanding area of the pitch for young players, requiring not only technical skill but tactical intelligence, physical endurance, and the ability to read the rhythm of the game. Cassap possesses all of these qualities in abundance. Her passing range is impressive, allowing her to dictate play from deep or to operate in more advanced areas. She has a natural sense of when to speed up the game and when to slow it down, a skill that often takes years to refine.\n\nCassap’s work rate is exceptional. She covers ground tirelessly, pressing opponents, recovering possession, and supporting both defensive and attacking phases. Her ability to transition quickly, from defence to attack and vice versa, makes her invaluable in a league where momentum can shift rapidly. She also has a creative spark, capable of threading passes through tight spaces and unlocking defences with moments of vision.\n\nWhat makes Cassap particularly exciting is her ceiling. She is already a technically gifted midfielder, but her potential for growth is enormous. With more minutes, more exposure to senior football, and more opportunities to test herself against experienced opponents, she could develop into one of the most influential players in the squad. Her presence on the bench is not simply a nod to her promise; it is a recognition that she is ready to contribute now, even if her role is still evolving.\n\nNiyah Dunbar’s progression through Sunderland’s pathway has been a quietly impressive example of how well the club develops its young talent. Having come through the academy, she made the step into first-team football with a confidence that immediately caught the eye. Even in limited minutes, she showed she could handle the physicality of senior competition, and her attitude earned her trust within the squad. The loan move to Middlesbrough has been the natural next step, giving her the chance to play every week and refine her game in a competitive environment.\n\nUp front, Dunbar offers a blend of energy, direct running and intelligent movement. She presses with real intent, unsettling defenders and setting the tone from the front. Her ability to drive at back lines, hold the ball under pressure and link play makes her a versatile option, while her instinct for finding pockets of space hints at a forward with significant long-term potential.\n\nAlongside these five, the honourable mentions of Katy Watson, Libbi McInnes and Reanna Blades highlight the depth of talent emerging from Sunderland’s system.\n\nKaty Watson’s emergence at Sunderland has been one of the most compelling stories in the women’s game over the past couple of seasons. A product of the club’s academy, she has moved through the pathway with a quiet determination that reflects both her character and the environment that shaped her. Initially introduced in short bursts from the bench, she quickly showed she could handle the physical and tactical demands of senior football, and her consistency has since made her a regular feature in the starting XI.\n\nWhat sets Watson apart on the wing is her blend of directness and intelligence. She carries the ball with real purpose, driving at full-backs and forcing defenders into uncomfortable decisions. Her movement is sharp and instinctive, often drifting inside to link play or stretching the pitch to create space for others. There’s a maturity to her decision-making that belies her age, and her work rate out of possession makes her invaluable in Sunderland’s pressing structure. As she continues to develop, she looks every bit like a player capable of shaping the club’s future.\n\nMcInnes, at 21, has already shown glimpses of what she can offer. Her technical ability is clear, and she has demonstrated composure in possession and intelligence in her movement. The challenge for her has been consistency of minutes, something that can be difficult to achieve in a competitive squad. Yet even without regular starts, she has made an impression. Her involvement in matchday squads signals that the coaching staff see her as part of the club’s future, and with continued development, she could become a more prominent figure.\n\nReanna Blades, also 21, has faced a different challenge: injury. Returning from injury is never easy, especially for young players who are still establishing themselves. Yet Blades has shown resilience, determination, and a willingness to work her way back into contention. Her previous performances demonstrated her potential, and there is every reason to believe that once she regains full fitness, she will reassert herself as a valuable option for the team. Her pace, energy, and attacking instincts make her a threat, and her ability to influence games from wide areas or more central positions adds tactical flexibility.\n\nTogether, these seven players illustrate the strength of Sunderland’s youth development. They are not isolated cases but part of a broader pattern that has defined the club for years. Sunderland’s academy is not simply good; it is exceptional. It has produced players who have gone on to represent England, to win major trophies, and to shape the landscape of women’s football. That legacy continues to inspire the next generation, who grow up knowing that the pathway to the top is not only possible but proven.\n\nThe club’s commitment to youth is not merely philosophical; it is practical. Sunderland has long understood that investing in young players is both sustainable and strategically advantageous. It creates a culture of loyalty, identity, and continuity. It fosters a sense of belonging among players who have grown through the system. And it ensures that the squad remains dynamic, adaptable, and forward-looking.\n\nThe current moment feels like a turning point. The increasing presence of young players on the bench is not a coincidence but a deliberate strategy. It reflects the coaching staff’s belief in their readiness, their potential, and their ability to contribute meaningfully. It also reflects the club’s long-term vision, which prioritises development, progression, and the integration of academy talent into the senior squad.\n\nThere is a sense of inevitability about what comes next. These players will not remain peripheral figures for long. Their involvement will grow, their minutes will increase, and their influence will expand. They will become part of the team’s core, shaping its identity and driving its success. The process may be gradual, but it is already underway.\n\nThe future of Sunderland Women looks bright not because of external investment or short-term recruitment but because of the strength of its foundations. The academy continues to produce players who are technically gifted, tactically intelligent, and emotionally resilient. It continues to attract and develop talent that fits the club’s ethos. And it continues to serve as a beacon of excellence in women’s football.\n\nAs the women’s game grows, the importance of strong development pathways becomes even more pronounced. Clubs that invest in youth, that nurture talent, and that create opportunities will be the ones that thrive. Sunderland is already ahead of the curve in this regard. Its track record speaks for itself, and its current generation of young players is poised to carry that legacy forward.\n\nThe rise of Blench, Paxton, West, Cassap, Dunbar, McInnes and Watson is not just a story of individual potential but a testament to the club’s enduring commitment to development. It is a reminder that Sunderland’s identity is built on more than results; it is built on people, on pathways, and on the belief that talent should be given the chance to flourish.\n\nIn the coming seasons, these young players will step onto the pitch not as prospects but as key contributors. They will shape matches, influence outcomes, and become part of the club’s narrative. Their emergence will not only strengthen the squad but also inspire the next generation of academy players who dream of following in their footsteps.\n\nSunderland’s future is being written now, in training sessions, in development fixtures, and on the benches of matchday squads. It is being written by young players who are ready to seize their moment, by coaches who believe in them, and by a club that understands the value of nurturing its own.\n\nThe inevitability of their rise is not a matter of hope but of history. Sunderland has always been a hotbed of talent, and it remains so today. The next chapter promises to be just as exciting as those that came before, driven by a new generation of players who are ready to make their mark.",

    "fullText": "Minnesota Vikings-themed rumors lit up like a Christmas tree after the organization fired general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah last week. The rumor mill never goes silent, but it’s amplified at the moment.\n\nThe latest Minnesota buzz ties Jefferson to trade chatter, frames Murray’s likely price tag, and flags a veteran free agent as a plausible fit.\n\nHere’s a look at the latest on the day of Super Bowl LX\n\nTrades and free agency dominate the Sunday, February 8th edition.\n\nRumor: The Buffalo Bills appear to be a trade suitor for Justin Jefferson.\n\nSI.com’s Alex Brasky kicked off the Jefferson trade speculation last week, noting, “It’s startling to consider what Jefferson could do with a quarterback like the Bills’ Josh Allen, the league’s reigning MVP. If you look at the Bills’ WR corps since the team traded former No. 1 Stefon Diggs after the 2023 season, the team’s leader has been Khalil Shakir, whose high watermark has been 821 yards, set in 2024.”\n\n“Allen has been desperately craving a top-tier pass catcher on the outside, and Jefferson would fulfill that role as one of the most dynamic WRs in all of football. If the Bills were to go out and acquire Jefferson, it would require quite the commitment in terms of trade pieces. Buffalo would likely have to offer up at least one first-round pick, along with several other picks, to sweeten the deal.” The price tag alone pushes the idea into the realm of front-office fantasy.\n\nThat hasn’t stopped the chatter from accelerating. Jefferson’s recent praise of Brady on a podcast poured fuel on the fire, sending Jefferson-to-Buffalo theories ricocheting around the internet.\n\n“For example, when the Kansas City Chiefs traded WR Tyreek Hill to the Miami Dolphins in March of 2022, the Dolphins were forced to part with a first, second and fourth-round selection in that upcoming draft, along with a fourth and sixth-rounder the following year,” Brasky continued.\n\n“There is also the Bills’ salary-cap situation to consider, as Buffalo is hard up against the cap as it stands in early February. According to Spotrac, the Bills are around $10 million over the league’s figure of about $301.2M to $305.7M.”\n\nJefferson said about Brady this week: “I feel like he was mostly the reason why I got picked first round. He’s the reason why my hands got better, why a lot of things occurred during that season, so I’m just proud of him to go from the (New Orleans) Saints to LSU, and now he’s back in the league and about to be a head coach.”\n\nThe only problem? Jefferson isn’t for sale. This is just Bills-themed daydreaming.\n\nRumor: Kyler Murray can get-got for a 2nd or 3rd-Round pick.\n\nA 2nd-Round pick could be enough to pry Murray loose via trade. Bleacher Report‘s Alex Kay scribed this week, “Projected Trade Value: 2026 2nd-Round Pick. A few quarterbacks may find themselves on the trade market, including Arizona Cardinals signal-caller Kyler Murray. The 28-year-old has never delivered any postseason success, and Arizona’s offense actually operated more efficiently with him out of the lineup this past season.”\n\n“The Cardinals will be rebuilding with a new head coach in 2026, so it may be the right time to move in a new direction at quarterback. Of course, his 2026 cap hit of $53.3 million could make it difficult for Arizona to maximize Murray’s trade value. However, the Cardinals may catch a break by having Moore return to college in 2026.”\n\nMurray’s name has hovered around the Vikings’ rumor mill since he was perceived as “softly benched” by the Cardinals earlier this season, keeping Minnesota loosely tied to any league-wide quarterback movement.\n\nKay added, “Another source believes that the starting price point for Murray will be a second-round pick, per Weinfuss, and that if the Cardinals can move the two-time Pro Bowler, they will. The Jets might be the one team desperate enough to expend draft and cap capital to take a flier on Murray.”\n\n“They were widely expected to take Moore at No. 2 overall — the Las Vegas Raiders will presumably snap up Indiana’s Fernando Mendoza at No. 1—before he announced he wouldn’t enter the draft. With no other QB prospect worthy of the second pick, New York may look to resurrect Murray’s career instead.”\n\nIf the price is this affordable, Minnesota should pounce. Murray is the fifth-most accurate passer in NFL history. He would cook with the Vikings.\n\nRumor: Kirk Cousins is the Vikings’ top free-agent target.\n\nWant a hot-shot cornerback? How about a safety? Nope, says CBS Sports. Jared Dubin claims Kirk Cousins, if released by the Atlanta Falcons, is the wisest Vikings free-agent target out there.\n\nHe explained: “With the J.J. McCarthy experiment seemingly going off the rails, the Vikings need to bring in a veteran quarterback to compete with him and/or be the backup and fill-in starter in case things don’t go well again.”\n\n“Cousins is likely set to hit free agency given his contractual situation, and we know he is familiar with both the Vikings and Kevin O’Connell’s system, making this an easy, comfortable fit.”\n\nCousins would check some boxes as a smart McCarthy insurance policy and will finally be cheap, but many Vikings fans would groan at the mere mention of his name. He’s a divisive dude.",

    "fullText": "Golden State Warriors general manager Mike Dunleavy was always going to face tough questions after what turned out to be an underwhelming trade deadline for Dub Nation. Many expected a blockbuster move for Giannis Antetokounmpo, but instead, the Warriors landed Kristaps Porzingis. Does that make them true contenders? Maybe not anymore, but that does not mean Dunleavy lacks confidence in his current group.\n\nThe season took a sharp turn for the worse when Jimmy Butler suffered a torn ACL that will sideline him for a year. That leaves Stephen Curry carrying an even heavier load to keep the Warriorscompetitive. The future Hall of Famer now finds himself more isolated than ever, especially with Draymond Green no longer performing at anything close to his prime level.\n\nSo, it was rumored that both Butler and Green were on the trade block in the Warriors’ attempt to get Giannis. When asked about the same in a recent interview, however, Dunleavy vehemently denied the same.\n\nThe reporters in attendance were trying to find out who exactly it was that the Warriors were okay with parting ways with, and Dunleavy got mad. Things got especially heated when someone, rather casually, declared that Draymond would have had to be a part of the deal to get Giannis to San Francisco.\n\n“No he wouldn’t,” Dunleavy responded. “You’re putting words in my mouth. So, that’s an unbelievable assumption.”\n\nIn most cases, reporters would take that as a cue to change the subject. But that person kept pressing on, asking the Warriors GM if it was Butler on the block instead. Unsurprisingly, it irked Dunleavy even more.\n\n“No, no. We’re not doing that. I’m not going down the roster talking about who’s in trades, who’s not. We don’t do that,” he declared, bringing the conversation to an end.\n\nWhat did raise eyebrows, however, was Draymond’s whole take on the matter. Of course, being a 14-year veteran and a franchise legend, he was talking to the front office about a potential Giannis deal. And according to his words on his podcast, Dunleavy told him that either Butler or he would have to be in a deal if the Greek were to come to the Bay.\n\nWhether Dunleavy would go ahead with that if the Bucks agreed will remain a mystery. Perhaps they’ll go after him again the summer. For now, Green stays put.\n\nThe post “Putting Words In My Mouth”: Warriors GM Gets Heated When Asked About Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green Trade Rumors appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Mario Bautista calls for a rematch against Cory Sandhagen following his win at Saturday's UFC Fight Night 266.",
    "fullText": "LAS VEGAS – Mario Bautista thinks the time is right to revisit the fight that gave him his first career defeat.\n\nAfter picking up a win at UFC Fight Night 266, Bautista (17-3 MMA, 11-3 UFC) called for a rematch against former UFC bantamweight title challenger Cory Sandhagen. Bautista, who submitted Vinicius Oliveira (23-4 MMA, 4-1 UFC) in the main event of Saturday's card at the Meta APEX in Las Vegas, thinks he's evolved enough to change the outcome of a fight between the two. In their first fight in 2019, Bautista lost to Sandhagen by first-round armbar.\n\n\"I think it goes completely different,\" Bautista told MMA Junkie and other reporters at the UFC Fight Night 266 post-fight press conference. \"I've had so much more experience. That was, I can't even (remember), maybe 10-12 fights ago? I've had a lot of experience in that time, and he's just kind of hanging out in that spot. He just can't break that championship spot. I think it would make for a great fight, so give me that opportunity to see where I can go.\"\n\nBautista's win over Oliveira got him back on track. He was coming off a unanimous decision loss to Umar Nurmagomedov in October, a defeat that snapped an impressive eight-fight unbeaten streak. Back in the win column, Bautista thinks a win over Sandhagen would get him that much-desired shot at the UFC bantamweight belt now held by Petr Yan.\n\n\"Definitely off Sandhagen, that calls for a shot at the title,\" Bautista said. \"I think I have a great style to beat the champ, and I'd give him a run for his money. I feel like I have to get past Sandhagen first. I lost my (UFC) debut to him, and it would just feel (wrong) if I passed him on that, so I want to get that one back.\"\n\nBautista has fought twice in less than four months. Ideally, he'd like to take a little time off and come back to fight Sandhagen after a longer break.\n\n\"Summertime would be nice,\" Bautista said. \"I just had two fights back-to-back, and this was a five-round camp, so it would be nice to catch up on some life in between this.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: Mario Bautista calls for rematch vs. Cory Sandhagen",

Bufkin has starred for L.A.'s South Bay affiliate and now rejoins the Lakers in his third NBA season to fill their 15th roster spot. pic.twitter.com/Z1m3M4KvTM\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) February 8, 2026\n\nThe Michigan native has made a name for himself this season with impressive performances for the Lakers' South Bay G-League team. In 26 games for South Bay, Bufkin has averaged 26.7 points on 43% shooting from 3 and 51.3% overall.\n\nThis signing comes after Bufkin posted a career-high 41 points on Wednesday in South Bay's win over Capital City Go-Go, having 30 of those points in the first half after starting the game seven for seven from 3. In the previous game, he started six for six from deep.\n\nBufkin gives the Lakers another 3-point weapon off the bench for coach JJ Redick, as the team now has two new additions to the roster after trading for sharpshooting guard Luke Kennard — for Gabe Vincent and a 2032 second-round pick — on the last day of the trade deadline.\n\nBufkin has appeared in four games this season for the Lakers after signing a 10-day contract with the team on Jan. 13. In those games he averaged 3.0 points in 11.3 minutes.",

    "fullText": "Dillon Brooks calls out Joel Embiid's 'flopping' after Suns' loss to the 76ers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns suffered a 109-103 loss to the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday. It was a cagey affair, as Dillon Brooks led the way for the Suns with a 28-point performance. On the other end, the 76ers relied on their two superstars, Joel Embiid and Tyrese Maxey, who combined for 62 points.\n\nEmbiid was dominant across the board with his 33 points, and he made a living from the charity stripe, as he was 11-for-13 from the line. This caught Brooks' ire, who took it upon himself to guard Embiid late in the game, but it was too little, too late.\n\nDespite his injuries, Embiid has maintained his status as one of the most unstoppable offensive players in the league. He is a physical behemoth who can dominate every game with his post presence and mid-range game. This has led to his matchups fouling him to prevent him from scoring.\n\nUnfortunately for most of his opponents, Embiid is a reliable free-throw shooter. That has led some fans and even players to resent how Embiid plays. On Saturday, it was Brooks who made veiled shots against the former MVP.\n\nMORE: Dillon Brooks calls out Draymond Green and Paul George for podcasts while still in the NBA\n\nBrooks was unhappy with how it turned out, especially since the Suns lost. Devin Booker returned from an ankle sprain and had a 21-point night, but it wasn't enough to help them win against the 76ers' overwhelming offense.\n\n\"Maybe start that earlier. I can guard the flooping and all that. 14 times. That's a lot, especially for stuff that are not even shooting fouls. It's a great group of refs that were reffing the game for Philly tonight,\" Brooks said about Embiid's game and how it was officiated.\n\nThe Suns are having a fantastic season, as they have beaten plenty of expectations. They have lost two consecutive games, which is not a good look. However, they can bounce back in the long run, especially with Booker's return.\n\nThey must get over this loss, but it can be tough after Brooks' comments. In the long run, this should not be the biggest loss on their record, but it could motivate them to be much better on defense.\n\nDraymond Green takes another swipe at Dillion Brooks\n\nDillon Brooks credits his Phoenix Suns teammates for helping him win Player of the Week\n\nCollin Gillespie joins Suns' all-time greats with monster game vs. Trail Blazers\n\nSuns trade for Cole Anthony, duck under luxury tax\n\nDillon Brooks receives support from teammate for All-Star push after recent performances",

    "description": "Before ONE Fight Night 40 this Friday, \"Vanilla Thunder\" explains how The Used became the soundtrack to his life.",
    "fullText": "Canadian heavyweight MMA fighter Ben Tynan may enjoy riding his dirt bike and exploring America’s backcountry, but there’s no doubt that everywhere he goes, he brings a little bit of a punk rock vibe to the party.\n\nA simple glance at “Vanilla Thunder” reveals that – he wears band T-shirts, has plugs in his ears, and bleaches his hair a shade of blonde that would make even Billie Joe Armstrong turn green with envy.\n\nTynan will bring that swagger into his showdown with Japanese knockout artist Ryugo Takeuchi at ONE Fight Night 40 on Friday, February 13, where he expects to deliver a signature performance. And, to steal a line from his favorite song by The Used, he’ll “savor every moment of this.”\n\nTynan’s fascination with The Used began when he was a young child living in Seattle, Washington.\n\nIn September 2002, the Utah-based post-hardcore collective dropped their first song “The Taste Of Ink,” a deceptively melodic track wrapped in raw emotion and featuring frontman Bert McCracken’s anguished vocals about his dissatisfaction with his place in life and burning desire to chase his dreams.\n\n“The Taste Of Ink” would serve as the leadoff single to their self-titled debut album, and a young Tynan would borrow his brother’s copy and play that specific record on repeat.\n\n“‘The Taste Of Ink’ is, like, the classic. That was the first one I heard as a kid. It was on my brother’s CD, and I remember going, ‘Ohh, this is cool.’ And what made it worse is I was so excited about it. I kept listening and listening to it.”\n\nEventually, Tynan listened to the rest of the songs on the self-titled LP and fell even \n\nThe four-piece became the soundtrack to his adolescence, as “Vanilla Thunder” obsessively consumed their follow-up albums – including 2004’s platinum-selling sophomore set In Love And Death, 2007’s Lies For The Liars, and 2009’s Artwork.\n\n“I went through a huge phase. I actually really liked their album Artwork. That came out when I was in high school, and it doesn’t get a lot of credit. But man, something about those songs, they hit so hard. Album-wise, I love Artwork. In Love And Death is an awesome album too.”\n\nIn November 2009, The Used was on tour in support of Artwork, and Tynan – then a sopho\n\nThere was a tour stop at Showbox SoDo, a converted-warehouse-turned-concert venue in Seattle, and the Canadian wrestling machine was able to secure a ticket and make the trek from his new home base in Eastern Washington.\n\n“That was my first big concert. I went to little shows before when I was younger, but I remember I was living in Eastern Washington at the time, and my sister was back living in Seattle. I had a buddy, and we road-tripped there. We had to skip school to make that concert, so we skipped a day of school and then went to Seattle and saw them. It was sick.”\n\nShowbox SoDo is a standing-room venue with a maximum capacity of 1,800 people, making the environment seem intimate, yet feel big enough for moshing around.\n\nAs soon as The Used went on stage and played the opening riffs of Artwork‘s lead single “Blood On My Hands,” the crowd went berserk. Tynan and his friend were in their element. They found their people, their favorite band was playing, and they were savoring the entire atmosphere.\n\n“It was packed, and I remember being a little dude getting all jacked up. There was a mosh pit, I went in it, and I got tossed around because I was a little pipsqueak back then. But, you know, it was good vibes. Everyone had good energy. It was really cool.”",

    "fullText": "After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.\n\nMany stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.\n\nMillions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.\n\nAnd many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US president Donald Trump will not be one of them.\n\nThe Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.\n\nThe Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.\n\nLed by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.\n\nThis is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has helped turn the Seahawks into narrow favourites, thanks also to a fearsome defence led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nMany of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.\n\nPuerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.\n\nHe will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years. He is also an actor, has hosted Saturday Night Live and been a WWE 24/7 champion.\n\nRock band Green Day, who are from California, will play an anniversary ceremony before Sunday's game and the NFL has teased that there will be some surprises at half-time.\n\nBad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of President Trump, and Bad Bunny's selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles.\n\nThe controversy even led conservative group Turning Point USA to plan an alternative half-time show, which will star singer and Trump ally Kid Rock.\n\nBad Bunny says he's losing sleep over the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend America's biggest game last year but he said this year's on the west coast is \"just too far away\".\n\nAsked about the selection of Bad Bunny and Green Day, Trump added: \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he avoided the US on his current world tour because of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nThere were fears there would be raids around the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, plus further protests after two people were shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\nBut, speaking on Tuesday, the NFL's chief security officer Cathy Lanier said that no ICE operations are scheduled around any of the many Super Bowl events.\n\nShe added that the Department of Homeland Security sends a variety of different agencies to the Super Bowl, which it ranks as a tier-one event, and ICE is not one of them.\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough Sunday's game will take place at the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium is 45 miles south of the Golden Gate Bridge in Santa Clara.\n\nWhile San Francisco has been the main hub during Super Bowl week, events and parties have been spread around the Bay Area, beginning with Opening Night in San Jose on Monday.\n\nActor Jon Hamm hosted the NFL's end-of-season awards night on Thursday, which was attended by Steve Irwin's son Robert, who earlier in the day took a snake into the media centre to help promote the first NFL game in Melbourne later this year.\n\nShaquille O'Neal hosted a party on Friday while Post Malone held a free concert, with artists as diverse as Olivia Dean, Shaboozey, Sting, Calvin Harris, Zach Bryan and Teddy Swims playing at other events.\n\nCardi B also performed on Saturday before watching her partner Stefon Diggs play for the Patriots on Sunday, when Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones are also among the gameday performers.\n\nOther visitors include Roger Federer, Jay Z, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and Paris St-Germain owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\n\nWahlberg's fellow New England fan Jon Bon Jovi will introduce the Patriots players on Sunday, with actor Chris Pratt, a Seattle supporter, doing the honours for the Seahawks.\n\nThe cheapest resale ticket available on Thursday cost $4,388 (£3,222)\n\nLast year's Super Bowl was watched by a TV audience of 127.7 million people in the US\n\nLast year's half-time performance by Kendrick Lamar averaged 133.5 million - making it the most-watched half-time show on record\n\nTV commercials have sold for an average of about $8m (£5.9m) for a 30-second slot, with a handful costing a record $10m\n\nAmericans will bet a record $1.76bn (£1.29bn) on Super Bowl 59, estimates the American Gaming Association\n\nThe National Chicken Council predicts that 1.48bn chicken wings will be eaten during the game\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is expected to generate more than $500m (£367m) for the local economy, with more than 90,000 visitors from outside the San Francisco Bay Area\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will kick-off on Sunday at 23:30 GMT and be broadcast live on Channel 5, Sky Sports and DAZN.\n\nYou can listen to live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds and follow live text coverage via the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNBC will be the host broadcasters this year in the US.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nSeahawks or Patriots?

It’s a shame that they conceded and allowed Wolves to get more and more into it in the second half, but Chelsea could have been even more goals up after that superb first half performance.\n\nAs you can see above, Bruno Fernandes posted on Palmer’s post on Instagram, showing his appreciation for the Chelsea star.\n\nQuality recognises quality it seems, and what a recognition for Palmer to get from one of the best and most consistently good midfielders in the league.\n\nLiam Rosenior has won 7 of his 9 Games in charge of Chelsea.\n\n15/15 Points in the Premier League.\n\nOnly two defeats have come against Arsenal, arguably the best team in Europe. (By 1 Goal each time).\n\nThis is a superb start for the Blues boss and long may it continue.",

    "fullText": "The Amex Stadium prepares for a high-stakes edition of the M23 derby this Sunday afternoon as Brighton and Crystal Palace look to banish recent struggles and claim local bragging rights.\n\nBoth clubs enter the second derby of the campaign in search of a much-needed “reset”. Fabian Hürzeler’s Seagulls have become the division’s draw specialists. Their 10 stalemates represent the highest tally in the Premier League this season. Meanwhile, Crystal Palace are currently enduring a dismal nine-match winless run. This form leaves Oliver Glasner’s side in 15th place and glancing nervously at the relegation zone. Only two points separate the rivals in the table.\n\nVenue: American Express Stadium, Brighton\n\nLast Meeting: Crystal Palace 0–0 Brighton (9 Nov 2025), Premier League\n\nFabian Hürzeler confirmed that midfielder Diego Gomez is back and available for selection. However, Yasin Ayari will miss out with a shoulder injury sustained last weekend. Mats Wieffer remains sidelined with a toe problem but is nearing a return. The Seagulls continue to be without long-term absentees Solly March, Adam Webster, and Stefanos Tzimas. Joel Veltman is expected to start at right-back over Ferdi Kadıoğlu.\n\nThe Eagles welcome back Adam Wharton after he served a one-match suspension. However, Eddie Nketiah is set to miss out with an injury. Cheick Doucouré (knee), Justin Devenny (ankle), and Daichi Kamada (muscle) are also unavailable. Ismaïla Sarr is expected to start in attack. Sarr has scored nine goals in all competitions this season.\n\nThe Seagulls have proved difficult to beat at home recently. Notably, Brighton have lost just two of their last 20 league games at the Amex. Only Liverpool and Arsenal have lost fewer home matches over the last two seasons. However, finding victories remains a challenge for Hürzeler’s side. Since December, they have earned just nine points in the Premier League.\n\nPalace arrive on the South Coast struggling for a clinical edge. Notably, the Eagles have underperformed their Expected Goals (xG) by over eight goals since Matchday 16. This represents the worst finishing differential in the entire league. Seven of the last 13 Premier League meetings between these sides have ended in draws. Ismaïla Sarr remains their primary threat, having scored twice on his last visit to the Amex.\n\nBrighton Predicted XI: Verbruggen; Veltman, Van Hecke, Dunk, De Cuyper; Gomez, Baleba, Gross; Rutter, Welbeck, Mitoma\n\nCrystal Palace Predicted XI: Henderson; Richards, Lacroix, Riad; Munoz, Hughes, Wharton, Mitchell; I. Sarr, Pino, Johnson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Premier League and Sky Sports Main Event. Coverage begins at 13:00 GMT.\n\nRead more- Thomas Frank ‘proud’ of 10-man Spurs following Man Utd defeat\n\nSee Also- Bruno Fernandes sends Man Utd message as winning run continues\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "fullText": "Liverpool host Manchester City at Anfield on Sunday while aiming to secure a second consecutive Premier League victory.\n\nThe Reds have moved into second place following their emphatic 4–1 win over Newcastle United. Manager Arne Slot oversaw a return to form for his attacking unit. Hugo Ekitiké was instrumental in that win. He currently averages a goal contribution every 112 minutes. Liverpool boast an incredible home record against City, losing just once in their last 22 meetings at Anfield. A win today would significantly close the gap on league leaders Arsenal.\n\nArne Slot manages a squad coping with several notable absences in the defensive and attacking lines. Notably, Jeremie Frimpong is ruled out with a thigh injury. Alexander Isak also remains on the treatment table. Consequently, Dominik Szoboszlai could start at right-back to provide defensive cover. Florian Wirtz enters the match in scintillating form, boasting nine goal involvements in his last 11 games.\n\nAlisson Becker will start in goal behind a defensive pairing of Ibrahima Konaté and Virgil van Dijk. Miloš Kerkez is expected to keep his place at left-back. In midfield, Ryan Gravenberch and Alexis Mac Allister will anchor the side. Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo will support Ekitiké from wide areas. Liverpool have earned 28 points from losing positions since the start of last season. Their resilience will be vital against the champions.\n\nLiverpool predicted XI: Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at Anfield on Sunday, 8 February 2026.

    "fullText": "Brighton host Crystal Palace at the Amex Stadium on Sunday while they aim to claim local bragging rights in the M23 derby.\n\nThe Seagulls have moved into mid-table safety despite a league-high 10 draws this season. Manager Fabian Hürzeler oversees a side that remains extremely tough to beat at home. Brighton have lost only twice at the Amex in their last 20 Premier League outings. A victory today would move them above Crystal Palace in the standings. It would also provide a massive psychological boost for the final third of the season.\n\nFabian Hürzeler manages a squad that welcomes back a key midfield presence. Notably, Diego Gomez is fit to start after missing recent matches. However, Yasin Ayari is out after suffering a shoulder injury against Everton. Consequently, Gomez will likely join Carlos Baleba and Pascal Groß in the engine room. Groß recently became the first Brighton player to score under four different Premier League managers.\n\nBart Verbruggen will start in goal behind a defence led by captain Lewis Dunk. James Milner could equal Gareth Barry’s record of 653 Premier League appearances if he features. Notably, Maxim De Cuyper is expected to retain his place at left-back. Danny Welbeck will lead the attack, supported by Kaoru Mitoma and Georginio Rutter. The Seagulls will look to improve on their recent form of just nine points since December.\n\nBrighton predicted XI: Verbruggen; Veltman, Van Hecke, Dunk, De Cuyper; Gomez, Baleba, Gross; Rutter, Welbeck, Mitoma\n\nThe Premier League fixture takes place at the American Express Stadium on Sunday, 8 February 2026.

    "fullText": "Anfield plays host to the definitive “main event” of Premier League gameweek 25 this Sunday as Liverpool and Manchester City renew a rivalry that has defined the modern era of English football.\n\nFor Pep Guardiola’s side, the trip to Merseyside is a high-stakes mission to stay within touching distance of league leaders Arsenal. The Citizens could find themselves nine points adrift by kick-off. Consequently, a victory at a ground where they historically struggle is almost non-negotiable. Liverpool appear to be emerging from a difficult winter slump. Arne Slot’s men rediscovered their “killer instinct” with a dominant 4–1 dismantling of Newcastle United last weekend. Sunday’s clash promises a high-octane tactical battle where neither side can afford to blink.\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester City 3–0 Liverpool (9 Nov 2025), Premier League\n\nArne Slot confirmed that Joe Gomez (hip) has a slight chance of making the matchday squad. However, the Reds will be without Jeremie Frimpong (thigh), who was ruled out earlier this week. Liverpool’s injury list also includes Conor Bradley, Alexander Isak, and Giovanni Leoni. On a positive note, Florian Wirtz enters the game in scintillating form. He boasts nine goal involvements in his last 11 appearances.\n\nPep Guardiola remains uncertain regarding the availability of captain Bernardo Silva. In better news, Rúben Dias returned to the bench midweek following a month-long layoff. John Stones has also resumed first-team training. Marc Guéhi is available after being ineligible for the EFL Cup. Erling Haaland is expected to return to the starting lineup after being rested as a substitute against Newcastle.\n\nThe Reds have made Anfield a fortress against today’s visitors. Notably, Liverpool have lost just one of their last 22 Premier League home games against Manchester City. They recently rediscovered their scoring touch in the dominant win over Newcastle. Hugo Ekitiké is proving to be a revelation this term. He averages a goal or assist every 112 minutes, the best debut-season ratio for a Liverpool player since Mohamed Salah.\n\nCity arrive with a strange statistical anomaly in 2026. Notably, they have not conceded a single first-half goal this year. However, they are also the only side yet to score a second-half goal, conceding six in that period. Rayan Cherki remains their primary creative hub, creating three chances per 90 minutes. Notably, Anfield remains one of only two grounds where Erling Haaland has played but never scored.\n\nLiverpool Predicted XI: Alisson; Szoboszlai, Konate, Van Dijk, Kerkez; Gravenberch, Mac Allister; Salah, Wirtz, Gakpo; Ekitike\n\nManchester City Predicted XI: Donnarumma; Nunes, Guehi, Ake, Ait-Nouri; Rodri, O’Reilly; Cherki, Reijnders, Semenyo; Haaland\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event, Sky Sports Premier League, and Sky Ultra HD. Coverage starts at 16:00 GMT.

Manager Oliver Glasner oversees a side that has struggled for goals recently. Palace have underperformed their Expected Goals (xG) by over eight goals since mid-December. However, they remain resilient in derbies, having drawn seven of their last 13 meetings with Brighton. A result today is vital to ease mounting pressure on the squad.\n\nOliver Glasner manages a squad bolstered by the return of its primary midfield anchor. Notably, Adam Wharton is available to start after serving a one-match suspension. However, Eddie Nketiah is set to miss out through injury. Consequently, the manager is expected to rely on Ismaïla Sarr to provide the goals. Sarr has nine goals this season and scored twice on his last visit to the Amex.\n\nDean Henderson will start in goal behind a defensive back three featuring Maxence Lacroix. Daniel Muñoz and Tyrick Mitchell will provide the width from wing-back positions. In midfield, Wharton will partner Will Hughes to provide defensive stability. Yeremy Pino and Brennan Johnson will support Sarr in a flexible front three.

However, manager Pep Guardiola oversees a side that has historically struggled at this venue. City won the reverse fixture 3–0 in November. They arrive in Merseyside seeking to break a curious scoring drought in 2026. While they have not conceded in the first half this year, they are yet to score a second-half goal. A victory today is essential to keep pressure on league leaders Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola manages a squad nearing full strength as key senior figures return to training. Notably, Rúben Dias and John Stones are both back in contention for a starting spot. However, Bernardo Silva remains a doubt following a knock sustained last week. Consequently, Tijjani Reijnders could occupy a central role. Rayan Cherki remains their primary creative outlet, creating three chances per 90 minutes.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma will start in goal behind a defensive line featuring Marc Guéhi. Nathan Aké and Rayan Aït-Nouri will provide the width from full-back roles. In midfield, Rodri will anchor the side alongside youngster Nico O’Reilly.

The Cougars have been gashed defensively during their losing streak, most notably having given up 99 points to unranked Oklahoma State.\n\nTo BYU’s credit, the defense did appear more engaged on Saturday. For the most part, the Cougars seemed more locked in and played with more toughness.\n\nHowever, Houston is still Houston.\n\nThe Cougars in red shot 47.5% from the field, 35% from 3-point range and averaged 1.31 points per possession in Provo, only turning the ball over four times. Houston hit a number of tough, contested shots and always found a way to manufacture scoring.\n\nThe defensive effort was better, to be sure. Perhaps that’s something for BYU to build off in order to get out of its current hole, but it still wasn’t nearly good enough.\n\nBYU’s big men struggled. The duo of Keba Keita and Abdullah Ahmed laid a major egg on Saturday, combining to shoot 3 of 10 from the field and 3 of 7 from the free throw line.\n\nKeita and Ahmed also managed just eight total rebounds in 38 minutes on the floor, getting beaten often on the glass to allow Houston to grab 13 offensive boards.\n\nAdditionally, Richie Saunders had his worst outing in recent memory by scoring just seven points on 1 of 8 shooting with three turnovers and a game-low minus-18 plus/minus, though he did post seven rebounds and four assists.\n\nAhmed’s five points were the only bench scoring for BYU all night, with the blue Cougars missing 12 free throws as well in the 11-point loss.\n\nThe water’s getting deep for BYU. Before the season, did anyone expect the Cougars to drop four straight games at any point this year?\n\nIt feels inevitable that the preseason No. 8 team in the country is about to fall out of Monday’s new AP Top 25 poll.\n\nBYU has lost five of its past six, only having beaten lowly Utah in that stretch. Four of those Cougar losses have come to ranked foes — in addition to the shocking letdown at Oklahoma State — but that’s a whole other problem altogether.\n\nBYU can’t beat the best of the Big 12. Kevin Young’s crew isn’t among the upper portion of the league.\n\nBYU’s bracketology picture is getting blurrier, as the prospect of receiving a top-16 protected seed on selection Sunday is slipping away with each new loss. The recent losses are making it much, much more difficult to find a favorable tournament road in March.\n\nBYU will look to get back to its winning ways Tuesday at Baylor, but as evidenced in Stillwater, road wins aren’t simple in the Big 12.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea striker Liam Delap is reportedly now playing for his future at the club in the second half of this Premier League season.\n\nDelap has been struggling at the club since he arrived from Ipswich Town in the summer transfer window. As well as with his form on the pitch, he has struggled with injuries off it too.\n\nI think Delap is a decent striker, but I’m starting to wonder whether he might just suit a team that plays on transition rather than possession based. He seems to be really struggling with Chelsea’s style of play. But maybe he can grow into it and get used to it a bit more? Well, apparently he has half a season to prove he can, otherwise Chelsea are looking to sell him…\n\nLiam Delap with Liam Rosenior in training. (Photo by Darren Walsh/Chelsea FC)\n\nLiam Delap’s former suitors are keeping a very close eye on developments at Stamford Bridge, with TEAMtalk reporting that the striker is effectively playing for his Chelsea future in the second half of the campaign.\n\nManchester United, Newcastle United and Everton all pushed hard for his signature before his move to Stamford Bridge, and all three clubs are apparently monitoring the situation closely should Chelsea decide to listen to offers. The report goes on to say that other clubs such as Brighton and Sunderland are also watching.\n\nChelsea beat Wolves 3-1 yesterday afternoon in their latest Premier League game, effectively winning the game in the first half by scoring all three of their goals to put it out of reach for the home side.\n\nCole Palmer was the hat-trick hero of the day, getting all three of Chelsea’s goals in the first half to announce himself fully back and ready for the rest of the campaign.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City take on Liverpool at Anfield today in what is a massive Premier League fixture. When City play Liverpool, it is one of the biggest Premier League fixtures of the season. Today’s match is no exceptionn, especially for Pep Guardiola’s side. City enter today’s match nine points behind Arsenal, who sit clear at the top of the Premier League. Manchester City have to beat Liverpool today at a ground where they typically don’t play well to keep in touch with Mikel Arteta’s side.\n\nHere is the latest Manchester City injury and team news, and my predicted City starting eleven ahead of today’s match.\n\nOn the injury front, Josko Gvardiol, Savinho, Mateo Kovacic and Jeremy Doku will all miss today’s match. The quartet have all been ruled out of the crucial Premier League fixture at Anfield. Bernardo Silva is also in doubt for today’s match. The City captain missed Manchester City’s win over Newcastle due to a hamstring injury. Pep Guardiola confirmed on Friday that Bernardo Silva is in doubt for today’s match.\n\nIn good news for City, Ruben Dias has trained all week and is available to play against Liverpool. It remains to be seen if he will start at Anfield. With Bernardo Silva in doubt for today’s match, Pep Guardiola may prefer to start Dias given the leadership that the Portuguese international provides. John Stones has finally returned to training after a lengthy injury layoff, but today’s match has likely come too soon for Stones to play any part.\n\nMarc Guehi is available to play today. Guehi was ineligible for Manchester City’s Carabao Cup semi-final second-leg tie against Newcastle.",

    "fullText": "Today we’re announcing a partnership with VirusTotal, the world’s leading threat intelligence platform, to bring security scanning to ClawHub—OpenClaw’s skill marketplace.\n\nTL;DR: All skills published to ClawHub are now scanned using VirusTotal’s threat intelligence, including their new Code Insight capability. This provides an additional layer of security for the OpenClaw community.\n\nFor the past 20 years, security models have been built around locking devices and applications down—setting boundaries between inter-process communications, separating internet from local, sandboxing untrusted code. These principles remain important.\n\nBut AI agents represent a fundamental shift.\n\nUnlike traditional software that does exactly what code tells it to do, AI agents interpret natural language and make decisions about actions. They blur the boundary between user intent and machine execution. They can be manipulated through language itself.\n\nWe understand that with the great utility of a tool like OpenClaw comes great responsibility. Done wrong, an AI agent is a liability. Done right, we can change personal computing for the better.\n\nOpenClaw skills are powerful. They extend what your AI agent can do—from controlling smart home devices to managing finances to automating workflows. But with that power comes risk.\n\nSkills are code that runs in your agent’s context, with access to your tools and your data. A malicious skill could:\n\nAs the OpenClaw ecosystem grows, so does the attack surface. We’ve already seen documented cases of malicious actors attempting to exploit AI agent platforms. We’re not waiting for this to become a bigger problem.\n\nWhen a skill is published to ClawHub:\n\nScan results are displayed on every skill page and in version history, with direct links to the full VirusTotal report.\n\nVirusTotal already protects the Hugging Face ecosystem using hash-based lookups against their threat intelligence database. Our integration goes further—we upload full skill bundles for Code Insight analysis, giving the AI a complete picture of the skill’s behavior rather than just matching known signatures.\n\nLet’s be clear: this is not a silver bullet.\n\nVirusTotal scanning won’t catch everything. A skill that uses natural language to instruct an agent to do something malicious won’t trigger a virus signature. A carefully crafted prompt injection payload won’t show up in a threat database.\n\nSecurity is defense in depth. This is one layer. More are coming.\n\nThis partnership is part of a broader security initiative at OpenClaw. In the coming days, we’ll be publishing:\n\nFollow progress and read the full security program overview at trust.openclaw.ai.\n\nWe’ve brought on Jamieson O’Reilly (founder of Dvuln, co-founder of Aether AI, CREST Advisory Council member) as lead security advisor to guide this program.\n\nAI agents that take real-world actions deserve real security processes. We’re building them.\n\nIf you publish skills to ClawHub, your code will now be scanned automatically. Here’s how it works:\n\nWe expect some false positives initially—security tooling isn’t perfect. If your skill is incorrectly flagged, reach out to us at security@openclaw.ai and we’ll review it.\n\nWhen browsing ClawHub, you’ll see scan status for each skill. This gives you one more data point when deciding what to trust. But remember:\n\nWe’re grateful to Bernardo Quintero and the VirusTotal team for their partnership. Their platform protects millions of users every day, and we’re proud to bring that protection to the OpenClaw community.\n\nThis is the beginning, not the end. We’re committed to making OpenClaw the most secure AI agent platform available. Expect more announcements soon.\n\nQuestions about security? security@openclaw.ai\n\n— Peter, Jamieson, and Bernardo",

Full lines or areas mean CW emission, dotted mean pulsed emission. The height of the line gives an indication of the maximal power/pulse energy commercially available. For the Ar+-Kr+ laser only the most important lines are labeled, the many other are shown only by a short tick, independently of their power. Note that the wavelength axis is highly distorted: up to 1000 nm it is linear in the wavelength, from then on logarithmic (with 300 px per decade up to 10 µm, then 30 px per decade). This is necessary for a good presentation of the visible region. For semiconductor lasers a solid fill shows the powers achievable with a single emitter, while horizontal lines indicate bars or stacks of bars.\n\nThe data and its references can be found in the spreadsheet Commercial laser lines.xls (unfortunately Wikipedia does not allow uploading spreadsheets). Currently most of the data is taken from Weber's book Handbook of laser wavelengths [1], with newer data in particular for semiconductor lasers.

    "fullText": "Mario Tchou (simplified Chinese: 马里奥·朱; traditional Chinese: 馬里奧·朱; 1924–1961), also known as Tchou Wang Li, was an Italian engineer of Chinese descent. He was a pioneer of computer science in Italy, who led a group of scientists from the University of Pisa to invent in 1959 the Olivetti Elea—the world's most powerful computer at the time.\n\nBorn in Rome on 26 June 1924, he was the son of Evelyn Wang and the diplomat Yin Tchou, who worked within the Consulate of the Republic of China at the Holy See.[citation needed]\n\nAfter obtaining his classical high school diploma at the Torquato Tasso Gymnasium High School in Rome, he undertook his studies in electrical engineering in Rome, at the La Sapienza University, and continued them with a scholarship in the United States, where, in 1947, he obtained a Bachelor of electrical engineering at the Catholic University of America in Washington.[1] He graduated from the New York University Polytechnic School of Engineering in 1949.[2][3][4][5][6][7][8]\n\nHaving moved to New York, he began teaching at Manhattan College while, at the same time, he specialized at the Polytechnic University of New York in Brooklyn, where, in 1949, he obtained a Master of Science with a thesis entitled Ultrasonic Diffraction. In the same year he married the Italian Mariangela Siracusa. In 1952, at the age of 28, he was called to teach at Columbia University in New York, in the department led by John R. Ragazzini.\n\nAfter the separation from his first wife, he married the artist Elisa Montessori in 1955, and they had two daughters.[9][10]\n\nGiven his knowledge of electronics, in 1955 Adriano Olivetti hired him into the company and entrusted him with the task of forming a working group which, in collaboration with the University of Pisa, had the aim of designing and building an all Italian electronic calculator, at the suggestion of Enrico Fermi, using the 150 million lire already allocated (for a synchrotron later built in Frascati) for the Pisan Electronic Calculator with valves and transistors. In the same year he separated from his first wife and remarried the painter Elisa Montessori, with whom he had two daughters. He later began working on the largest Olivetti Elea, the greatest transistor supercomputer of the time, later built in 40 examples.\n\nMario Tchou's activity was based on a vision that focused on high innovation. In the laboratory of Barbaricina (a district of the city of Pisa) he gathered the best brains, all young: \"Because new things are only done with young people. Only young people throw themselves into it with enthusiasm, and collaborate in harmony without personalism and without the obstacles deriving from a customary mentality.\" He considered Italy \"at the same level as the most advanced countries in the field of electronic calculating machines from a qualitative point of view. The others, however, receive enormous help from the state. The United States allocates huge sums for electronic research, especially for military purposes. Britain also spends millions of pounds. Olivetti's effort is relatively notable, but the others have a more secure future than ours, being helped by the State\"\n\nThe young engineer personally tried to get closer to Ivrea, the historic headquarters of Olivetti, to break down the wall of distrust that the employees of the mechanical sector had towards the newly formed electronics division, but his attempts were in vain: the mechanical and electronic sectors remained divided, like their respective headquarters, one in Ivrea, the other in Borgolombardo, a hamlet of San Giuliano Milanese, where the Barbaricina group moved in 1960. The engineer was placed in charge of the newly established Electronic Research Laboratory (LRE).\n\nMario Tchou died together with his driver Francesco Frinzi (1933–1961) in a tragic car accident on the morning of 9 November 1961, at just 37 years old, on the Milan-Turin motorway overpass, just before the Santhià toll booth; the driver lost control of the car after overtaking and crashed into a van.[11] That morning Tchou was traveling to Ivrea to discuss the design of a new transistor architecture.[citation needed]\n\nThe sudden death of Tchou, a year after that of Adriano Olivetti, decreed the end of the Elea project and closed an important season for Italian electronics, which at the time saw the industrial and technological leadership of Olivetti. The electronics division was decommissioned and sold to General Electric in 1964.",

    "fullText": "Will Lewis, the former CEO and publisher of the Washington Post, had a terrible tenure at the paper. The two years he spent there, which ended Saturday with a two-paragraph memo, are chiefly notable for a series of cuts and layoffs, culminating in a 30% bloodletting days ago.\n\nBut let's be clear: This one is on Jeff Bezos.\n\nMost obviously, that's because Bezos owns the Post, and Bezos was the one who hired Lewis to run the business for him.\n\nBezos was also the one signing off on Lewis's actions at the paper, which mostly amounted to making the paper smaller while telling the staff that \"people are not reading your stuff.\"\n\nAnd slightly less obviously, it was Bezos who dramatically worsened the Post's business outlook. He decided not to endorse a presidential candidate in 2024, weeks before the election — a move that outraged many Post readers, who saw the non-endorsement as an attempt to cater to Donald Trump.\n\nThat led to more than 250,000 subscriber cancellations, a huge problem for a paper whose circulation peaked at 3 million in 2021.\n\nThe best case argument you could make for Lewis era at the Post, if you are inclined, would go something like this: Bezos, who bought the Post in 2013 and then invested heavily in staff, realized a few years ago that he now employed many more people than his business would support. So he brought Lewis in to do the grim work of shrinking the publication. Now that work is done, so Lewis can do something else and Bezos can find someone to help the Post grow again.\n\nBut the timing of Lewis' departure — late afternoon on a Saturday, following days of howling from Post employees and many others about Lewis and Bezos' stewardship of the paper — suggests this was not a long-in-the-making move.\n\nAnd again, whether Lewis jumped or was pushed doesn't matter in the end. The Washington Post is Jeff Bezos. He gets praise if things are going well — which, for several years after his purchase, seemed to be the case — and blame when it doesn't.\n\nHere I'll also point out that Bezos, who has no problem being seen jet-setting around the world in a style befitting the world's fourth-richest man, has been totally MIA during his paper's recent turmoil.\n\nOn Saturday, when the paper announced it had promoted Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio to acting publisher and CEO, Bezos finally attached his name to a public statement, promising that the new Post would thrive by giving readers things they wanted to read.\n\n\"The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus,\" he said in a Post press release.\n\nThat might qualify for an insight 30 years ago, when newspapers were struggling to respond to the internet. Now that's table stakes, and you would hope the guy who created Amazon has more up his sleeve.\n\n\"I have a bunch of ideas,\" for the Post, Bezos said in the fall of 2024. \"I'm working on that right now.\"",

But it's not too late to save The Post. Jeff Bezos must immediately rescind these layoffs or sell the paper to someone willing to invest in its future.\"\n\nRepresentatives for the Post union did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nOn social media, laid-off reporters celebrated the news of Lewis' departure. Jada Yuan, a former culture writer at the Post, wrote that she had \"never been more thrilled with a news alert.\"\n\n\"Will Lewis, the absent, ineffective publisher of @washingtonpost has resigned. Or been fired,\" she added. \"It sucks that it happened after he couldn't even show up on zoom to lay off 1/3 of the company. But the important thing is he's gone.\"\n\nLewis' exit was announced Saturday afternoon, just days after sweeping layoffs hit the legacy publication, leaving hundreds of reporters out of work.\n\nThe publication's unionized employees held a \"Save the Post\" rally earlier this week, focused on Bezos and Lewis, and said there were risks to press freedom and independent news if legacy publications like the Post are unable to continue operating.",

    "fullText": "Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos gave his first public statement since the paper enacted massive job cuts this week, and it focused on \"data\" and understanding reader interests.\n\nThe billionaire Amazon founder, who built one of the world's most valuable companies with a relentless focus on customer satisfaction, indicated he wanted to see that same energy at the Post.\n\n\"The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity,\" Bezos wrote. \"Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.\"\n\nBezos' statement came as Post CEO Will Lewis announced he was stepping down, to be replaced in an interim capacity by Post CFO Jeff D'Onofrio.\n\nIn his own statement, D'Onofrio said that \"customer data will drive our decisions, sharpening our edge in delivering what is most valuable to our audiences.\"\n\nBezos and D'Onofrio's statements struck a similar tone to comments made by the paper's top editor, Matt Murray, in addressing staff earlier this week.\n\n\"Today is about positioning ourselves to become more essential to people's lives in what has become a more crowded, competitive, and complicated media landscape,\" Murray said during a staff call on Wednesday. \"For too long, we've operated with a structure that's too rooted in the days when we were a quasi-monopoly local newspaper.\"\n\nFollowing the layoffs, Murray spoke repeatedly about focusing on areas of reader interest and understanding audience data in an appearance on the Puck podcast \"The Grill Room.\"\n\nHe said that when he was brought on, he felt the company hadn't \"fully embraced the digital internet revolution the right way.\"\n\nHe added that the company had a \"long way to go in using data — data to inform what we wrote, data to inform how we publish, data to understand our audience, data to understand our readers, data to understand our prospects.\"\n\nThe outspoken focus on data from Post leadership has drawn some criticism.\n\n\"'Customer data' is what has replaced 'focus group' for the same type of folks who pretty much killed Sports Illustrated by stamping out its originality and magnetism in favor of formulaic swill,\" The Atlantic's Sally Jenkins, formerly of the Post, wrote Saturday on X.\n\nStill, the messaging from Post leadership could help appease some critics who have seen management moves in recent years as rooted in political ideology and not data — though it will be difficult to win them over.\n\nThe Post faced a revolt both inside the newsroom and among readers when Bezos made a late-hour call in 2024 that the paper wouldn't endorse a presidential candidate for the first time in 36 years. NPR reported that more than 200,000 subscriptions were canceled in the days following.\n\nThe paper faced another round of criticism in February 2025 when Bezos decided to reorient the Post's opinion section — generally considered the owner's prerogative — around personal liberties and free markets.\n\nFormer Post executive editor Martin Baron, who worked closely with Bezos during his tenure atop the paper, wrote in a LinkedIn post after the layoffs that the Post's challenges had been made \"infinitely worse by ill-conceived decisions that came from the very top.\"\n\nCritics of Bezos' moves have said he should consider financially supporting the paper, given its role in society.\n\n\"It just seems heartbreaking that he doesn't feel the paper is important enough to bankroll,\" Sally Quinn, the longtime journalist and widow of former Post executive editor, Ben Bradlee, said this week on CNN.\n\nBezos said in his statement that he felt the Post's leadership going forward could build an \"exciting and thriving next chapter\" for the paper.",

    "fullText": "MILAN (AP) — Italian police fired tear gas and a water cannon at dozens of protesters who threw firecrackers and tried to access a highway near a Winter Olympics venue on Saturday.\n\nThe brief confrontation came at the end of a peaceful march by thousands against the environmental impact of the Games and the presence of U.S. agents in Italy.\n\nPolice held off the violent demonstrators, who appeared to be trying to reach the Santagiulia Olympic ice hockey rink, after the skirmish. By then, the larger peaceful protest, including families with small children and students, had dispersed.\n\nEarlier, a group of masked protesters had set off smoke bombs and firecrackers on a bridge overlooking a construction site about 800 meters (a half-mile) from the Olympic Village that's housing around 1,500 athletes.\n\nPolice vans behind a temporary metal fence secured the road to the athletes’ village, but the protest veered away, continuing on a trajectory toward the Santagiulia venue. A heavy police presence guarded the entire route.\n\nThere was no indication that the protest and resulting road closure interfered with athletes’ transfers to their events, all on the outskirts of Milan.\n\nThe demonstration coincided with U.S. Vice President JD Vance’s visit to Milan as head of the American delegation that attended the opening ceremony on Friday.\n\nHe and his family visited Leonardo da Vinci's “The Last Supper” closer to the city center, far from the protest, which also was against the deployment of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents to provide security to the U.S. delegation.\n\nU.S. Homeland Security Investigations, an ICE unit that focuses on cross-border crimes, frequently sends its officers to overseas events like the Olympics to assist with security. The ICE arm at the forefront of the immigration crackdown in the U.S. is known as Enforcement and Removal Operations, and there is no indication its officers are being sent to Italy.\n\nAt the larger, peaceful demonstration, which police said numbered 10,000, people carried cardboard cutouts to represent trees felled to build the new bobsled run in Cortina. A group of dancers performed to beating drums. Music blasted from a truck leading the march, one a profanity-laced anti-ICE anthem.\n\n“Let’s take back the cities and free the mountains,” read a banner by a group calling itself the Unsustainable Olympic Committee. Another group called the Association of Proletariat Excursionists organized the cutout trees.\n\n“They bypassed the laws that usually are needed for major infrastructure project, citing urgency for the Games,” said protester Guido Maffioli, who expressed concern that the private entity organizing the Games would eventually pass on debt to Italian taxpayers.\n\nHomemade signs read “Get out of the Games: Genocide States, Fascist Police and Polluting Sponsors,” the final one a reference to fossil fuel companies that are sponsors of the Games. One woman carried an artificial tree on her back decorated with the sign: “Infernal Olympics.”\n\nThe demonstration followed another last week when hundreds protested the deployment of ICE agents.\n\nLike last week, demonstrators Saturday said they were opposed to ICE agents’ presence, despite official statements that a small number of agents from an investigative arm would be present in U.S. diplomatic territory, and not operational on the streets.",

    "fullText": "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — For days, Luis Ramirez had an uneasy feeling about the men dressed as utility workers he’d seen outside his family’s Mexican restaurant in suburban Minneapolis.\n\nThey wore high-visibility vests and spotless white hard hats, he noticed, even while parked in their vehicle. His search for the Wisconsin-based electrician advertised on the car’s doors returned no results.\n\nOn Tuesday, when their Nissan returned to the lot outside his restaurant, Ramirez, 31, filmed his confrontation with the two men, who hide their faces as he approaches and appear to be wearing heavy tactical gear beneath their yellow vests.\n\n“This is what our taxpayer money goes to: renting these vehicles with fake tags to come sit here and watch my business,” Ramirez shouts in the video.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security and Immigration and Customs Enforcement did not respond to inquiries about whether the men were federal immigration officers. But encounters like Ramirez's have become increasingly common.\n\nAs the sweeping immigration crackdown in Minnesota continues, legal observers and officials say they have received a growing number of reports of federal agents impersonating construction workers, delivery drivers and in some cases anti-ICE activists.\n\nNot all of those incidents have been verified, but they have heightened fears in a state already on edge, adding to legal groups' concerns about the Trump administration’s dramatic reshaping of immigration enforcement tactics nationwide.\n\n“If you have people afraid that the electrical worker outside their house might be ICE, you’re inviting public distrust and confusion on a much more dangerous level,” said Naureen Shah, the director of immigration advocacy at the American Civil Liberties Union. “This is what you do if you’re trying to control a populace, not trying to do routine, professional law enforcement.”\n\nA ‘more extreme degree’ of deception\n\nIn the past, immigration authorities have sometimes used disguises and other deceptions, which they call ruses, to gain entry into homes without a warrant.\n\nThe tactics became more common during President Donald Trump’s first term, attorneys said, prompting an ACLU lawsuit accusing immigration agents of violating the U.S. Constitution by posing as local law enforcement during home raids. A recent settlement restricted the practice in Los Angeles. But ICE deceptions remain legal elsewhere in the country.\n\nStill, the undercover operations reported in Minnesota would appear to be a “more extreme degree than we’ve seen in the past,” said Shah, in part because they seem to be happening in plain sight.\n\nWhere past ruses were aimed at deceiving immigration targets, the current tactics may also be a response to the Minnesota's sprawling networks of citizen observers that have sought to call attention to federal agents before they make arrests.\n\nAt the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building in Minneapolis, the city’s central hub of ICE activity, activists told The Associated Press they had seen agents leaving in vehicles with stuffed animals on their dashboards or Mexican flag decals on their bumpers. Pickups with lumber or tools in their beds were also frequently spotted.\n\nIn recent weeks, federal agents have repeatedly shown up to construction sites dressed as workers, according to Jose Alvillar, a lead organizer for the local immigrant rights group, Unidos MN.\n\n“We’ve seen an increase in the cowboy tactics,” he said, though he noted the raids had not resulted in arrests. “Construction workers are good at identifying who is a real construction worker and who is dressing up as one.”\n\nSince the start of the operation in Minnesota, local officials, including Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, have said ICE agents had been seen swapping license plates or using bogus ones, a violation of state law.\n\nCandice Metrailer, an antiques dealer in south Minneapolis, believes she witnessed such an attempt firsthand.\n\nOn Jan. 13, she received a call from a man who identified himself as a collector, asking if her store sold license plates. She said it did. A few minutes later, two men in street clothes entered the shop and began looking through her collection of vintage plates.\n\n“One of them says, ‘Hey, do you have any recent ones?’” Metrailer recalled. “Immediately, an alarm bell went off in my head.”\n\nMetrailer stepped outside while the men continued browsing. A few doors down from the shop, she saw an idling Ford Explorer with blacked out windows. She memorized its license plate, then quickly plugged it into a crowdsourced database used by local activists to track vehicles linked to immigration enforcement.\n\nThe database shows an identical Ford with the same plates had been photographed leaving the Whipple building seven times and reported at the scene of an immigration arrest weeks earlier.\n\nWhen one of the men approached the register holding a white Minnesota plate, Metrailer said she told him that the store had a new policy against selling the items.\n\nMetrailer said she had reported the incident to Minnesota’s attorney general. A spokesperson for DHS did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSupporters of the immigration crackdown say the volunteer army of ICE-tracking activists in Minneapolis has forced federal agents to adopt new methods of avoiding detection.\n\n“Of course agents are adapting their tactics so that they’re a step ahead,” said Scott Mechkowski, former deputy director of ICE enforcement and operations in New York City. “We’ve never seen this level of obstruction and interference.”\n\nIn nearly three decades in immigration enforcement, Mechkowski said he also hadn’t seen ICE agent disguising themselves as uniformed workers in the course of making arrests.\n\nEarlier this summer, a spokesperson for DHS confirmed a man wearing a high-visibility construction vest was an ICE agent conducting surveillance. In Oregon, a natural gas company published guidance last month on how customers could identify their employees after reports of federal impersonators.\n\nIn the days since his encounter, Ramirez, the restaurant worker, said he has been on high alert for undercover agents. He recently stopped a locksmith who he feared might be a federal agent, before quickly realizing he was a local resident.\n\n“Everybody is on edge about these guys, man,” Ramirez said. “It feels like they’re everywhere.”",

    "fullText": "President Trump is pleading with November voters to remember his policy victories—and not his racist Truth Social posts.\n\nTrump, 79, took to his social media platform Friday evening to brag about rolling back Obama-era restrictions on commercial fishing off the coast of New England. The post came one day after Trump earned widespread condemnation for posting an AI-generated video depicting the Obamas as apes.\n\n“Today, I signed a Presidential Proclamation to UNLEASH Commercial Fishing in the Atlantic Ocean, advancing the America First Fishing Policy!“, Trump wrote.\n\n“Please remember I did this for you, against strong Democrat opposition, and VOTE REPUBLICAN IN THE MIDTERMS!”\n\nTrump’s Friday proclamation “restores commercial fishing access to all 4,913 square miles of the Northeast Canyons and Seamounts Marine National Monument, located off the coast of New England.”\n\nPresident Obama established the nearly 5,000-square-mile preserve east of Cape Cod in 2016, looking to protect vulnerable undersea coral ecosystems. Trump rolled back the protections in his first term, and Joe Biden restored them during his.\n\nTrump described the proclamation as a benevolent favor to the New England area, which has voted for the Democratic candidate in all three presidential elections in which Trump has been on the ballot.\n\n“Hard to believe you vote for Democrats who did this to you, but not for ‘TRUMP,’ who gets you out of this Environmental and Economic Malaise,” the president scolded, adding, “VOTE REPUBLICAN FROM NOW ON!”\n\nTrump’s plea for midterm momentum comes at a time when all signs point to the Democrats dominating the GOP in November, with a serious chance to win back both chambers of Congress.\n\nTrump’s awful polling on the economy and immigration—two issues that were strengths for him in his 2024 election victory—has become an albatross for vulnerable Republican incumbents.\n\nNow, beleaguered GOP politicians have to square their re-election bids with their party leader posting grossly racist videos of his old political foes.\n\nTrump posted a video that featured the heads of Barack and Michelle Obama superimposed onto apes during a late Thursday night posting spree.\n\nThe administration has thrown a myriad of excuses at the controversy. White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said it was merely a Lion King meme, even though there are no apes in The Lion King. Trump said he didn’t see the offending part of the video, as it occurs toward the end of the clip.\n\nThe GOP is reportedly panicking over the post.\n\n“I talked to several House members that are just besides themselves, and they don’t know how they’re going to handle it on the road,” Mulvaney added.\n\nNotably, some GOP incumbents have broken from Trump on the video. Nebraska Senator Pete Ricketts, up for reelection in 2026, was among several GOP politicians who unequivocally condemned Trump’s racist Obama post.\n\n“Even if this was a Lion King meme, a reasonable person sees the racist context to this,” he posted on X. “The White House should do what anyone does when they make a mistake: remove this and apologize.”",

    "fullText": "Former Cowboys star reveals he was almost traded to Eagles originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys traded star defensive end Micah Parsons to the Green Bay Packers before the start of the 2025 NFL season.\n\nBut according to Parsons, he was very close to becoming a member of the Philadelphia Eagles before he was ultimately shipped to Green Bay.\n\n“To be honest with you, bro, it was very close. It was very close to being the Eagles. Before the Jaelen Phillips [trade], it was me,” Parsons said of a trade to the Eagles on a recent episode of his podcast.\n\nParsons says he nixed the potential trade to Philadelphia because it would have required the Eagles to part ways stud defensive tackle Jalen Carter, who Parsons would have wanted to play alongside.\n\nMore: A.J. Brown sends clear message regarding his future with Eagles\n\n“Yeah, it was me and I was really about to come but there was one person that I had to play with that if he was gone I did not want to be there, and that was Jalen Carter,\" Parsons said.\n\n\"They wanted a defensive tackle. And they wanted to trade me plus some picks. I don't really care about the picks, but I'm coming to play next to J.C., you feel me? … So, sorry, Cowboys fans. It really almost happened.”\n\nIt’s fair to wonder exactly how accurate this account of the situation is, or if the Cowboys would have actually traded Parsons to another team in the NFC East. But, if Parsons is to be believed, it certainly sounds like he was pretty close to becoming an Eagle.\n\nThat would have been something that probably wouldn’t have sat well with Cowboys fans. Losing Parsons is one thing, but losing him to a divisional rival that you have to play twice a season would be like salt in the wound.\n\nKey coach announces departure from Philadelphia Eagles\n\nPatriots legend calls out Tom Brady for Super Bowl prediction\n\nDallas Cowboys' 2026 breakout candidate revealed by Pro Football Focus",

    "description": "Speaking with MLB Network, UCLA shortstop Roch Cholowsky reflects on his breakout Bruins season, his path away from football, and how a lifetime around professional scouting has shaped him into a potential No. 1 overall pick.",
    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES -- Roch Cholowsky has never lacked perspective on where he is — or where he’s headed.\n\n“It's a special award, the best of the best win it.” 😤@UCLABaseball standout Roch Cholowsky joined #MLBNHotStove to discuss the upcoming season and the @USAGoldenSpikes Award.\n\nFind out the full #GoldenSpikes Preseason Watch List today at 3pm ET! pic.twitter.com/R1HUpVhy85\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 6, 2026\n\nThe UCLA shortstop, widely viewed as a potential No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming MLB Draft, recently reflected on a Bruins program that rebounded sharply after a difficult stretch, setting the stage for what could be a defining year in his baseball journey. After going 19–33 during his freshman season, Cholowsky said the team made a conscious decision to stay unified, recommit in the offseason, and reset expectations.\n\nThat approach paid off. UCLA surged to a fifth-place finish last season and returns much of its core, giving Cholowsky confidence that the Bruins can build on that momentum. While outside recognition has followed, including early Golden Spikes Award buzz, Cholowsky emphasized that team success remains the priority. Individual honors, he noted, would be meaningful, but a national championship is the ultimate goal.\n\nBeing mentioned alongside past Golden Spikes winners is not something Cholowsky takes lightly. He described the award as baseball’s equivalent of the Heisman, reserved for the game’s elite, and acknowledged that hearing his name in that conversation is both humbling and motivating. Still, he views it as a byproduct of doing the right things on the field rather than a singular pursuit.\n\nCholowsky’s long-term vision was already clear coming out of high school, when he went undrafted despite interest from several clubs. He said most teams understood he was committed to UCLA, a decision he felt was the right one after experiencing college baseball firsthand. The limited draft dialogue only reinforced his belief that development and patience would pay off.\n\nThat clarity extended to his choice to step away from football. A standout high school quarterback, Cholowsky admitted it was difficult to leave the sport behind, but focusing exclusively on baseball allowed him to fully invest in his growth. Once acclimated, he said, his progress accelerated.\n\nFew players arrive at that crossroads with Cholowsky’s background. His father, Dan, spent years in professional baseball as both a player and a scout, giving Roch a rare window into the evaluation process from a young age. From sitting in on in-home scouting meetings to hearing firsthand stories about elite prospects, those experiences shaped how he understands the game.\n\nFor Cholowsky, that foundation — combined with performance — has positioned him for an extraordinary few months ahead, even as he remains grounded in the work still to be done.",

    "title": "Did ESPN Steal Cowboys Scoop? George Pickens Franchise Tag Contract Update",
    "description": "Cowboys Roundtable had the George Pickens scoop more than two months ago. So how is a major Cowboys story being claimed by ESPN as an exclusive?",
    "fullText": "ESPN's Adam Schefter is using Super Bowl Weekend to promote what he is characterizing as a \"scoop'' regarding George Pickens.\n\nThe problem? To put a very fine point on this: The Dallas Cowboys' plan with George Pickens and the franchise tag is not Schefter's scoop.\n\nSchefter writes, \"The Dallas Cowboys are expected to place their franchise tag on Pro Bowl wide receiver George Pickens, league sources told ESPN.''\n\nYeah, we know, Adam. It's just that you're more than two months late.\n\nSchefter is right. Just like our Mike Fisher was right on Nov. 27 when he broke the first sourced story on Dallas' intentions here at CowboysRoundtable.com. ... and it is therefore disingenuous for Schefter and ESPN to pretend they're \"breaking a story'' here.\n\nSome might even accuse them of \"stealing credit for a story.''\n\nIs there really anything new here? We'll credit colleague Calvin Watkins of the Dallas News for noting that the Cowboys have yet to alert Pickens' agent to the plan. (Maybe somebody will alert Schefter to this so he can claim another \"scoop''!)\n\nAnd we're trying to explain to the world that the Cowboys can create plenty of cap room (without CeeDee Lamb having to give up salary) to make it happen.\n\nThe original story (with the link above), reprinted verbatim from Nov. 27 here at CowboysRoundtable.com reads as follows ...\n\nGeorge Pickens is taking full advantage of existing in the eye of a perfect storm.\n\nLast spring, the Dallas Cowboys were desperate to trade for an explosive offensive weapon. Pickens left Pittsburgh and its mediocre quarterback play and created instant chemistry with Pro Bowl QB Dak Prescott. And in a contract year, he's posting the best numbers of his career.\n\n“I’m really just grinding,” Pickens said modestly, reflecting on a 2025 campaign during which he's second among all NFL players in receiving yards (1,054) and third in receiving touchdowns (eight). This is kind of always what I was capable of. …\n\n\"Hopefully, I can just keep doing what I’m doing. Stay in the lab.”\n\nAnd if he continues even near this pace? And continues to put his Steelers-era behavioral baggage behind him?\n\nAs he's in the final year of his rookie contract, the free-agent-to-be will move from the lab to the negotiating table.\n\nAnd amid much speculation on Dallas' plan in that regard? A source is making is very clear to me.\n\n\"The first step, the easy step, is the franchise tag,'' the source said. \"And then we go from there.''\n\nThe Steelers traded Pickens and a 2027 sixth-round pick to the Cowboys in exchange for a 2026 third-round pick and a 2027 fifth-round pick, and at the time, Dallas knew this might just be a risky rental.\n\nBut now? Pickens is described by Prescott as being other-wordly.\n\n“He’s not from this planet,’‘ Dak said.\n\nAnd \"GP'' is developing to the point at which he's seen as an equal to teammate and fast friend CeeDee Lamb. The four-time Pro Bowler Lamb makes $34 million APY - a top-three number in the NFL, behind only Cincinnati's Ja'Marr Chase ($40 mil) and Minnesota's Justin Jefferson ($36 mil).\n\nPickens' agent, David Mulugheta, can reasonably be planning on asking for the same.\n\nCan Dallas afford that? Unquestionably, as a simple seven-step program (which we illustrate in great detail here) can free up $110 million under the 2026 cap of about $295.5 million.\n\nWill Dallas pay that? It doesn't have to. ... because of the tag, projected to be a guaranteed $28 million for 2026.\n\nDoes Cowboys owner Jerry Jones envision any scenario in which where Pickens plays anywhere other than Dallas in 2026?\n\n“No, I do not at this time,’’ Jones said on 105.3 The Fan this week. \"We've got two No. 1 receivers and that's just exceptional right at the time, guess what? Our quarterback (Dak Prescott) is probably the best that he's ever been. There's more there.\"\n\n\"The Dak Window'' is one reason to commit to keeping Pickens, who is just 24. He oversees what is now the No. 1 offense in the league, but he's 32. It makes sense for Dallas to shoot its shot while Prescott remains a viable star.\n\nDallas will open negotiations with Pickens after the completion of this season. What could go wrong?\n\nThere is the unlikely scenario in which Pickens loses control of his emotions or shows a selfish side; some in Pittsburgh saw those things as problems, which led to the Steelers' willingness to give up on him.\n\nJones doesn't see that happening.\n\n\"He's an outstanding teammate,\" Jones said. \"He brings energy to the team even when he's not making some of those great receptions. Bottom line, it's working, and it's precious to have it here right at this time with what we're trying to do with Dak and how we're trying to maximize having him.\"\n\nOr, the Cowboys could drag their feet. Or the agent could drag his. But even in that scenario, if negotiations don't progress, Dallas plans to tag him by March 3. And if no deal is reached by mid-July?\n\nPickens is a Cowboy on the tag.\n\n“Of course we want George Pickens back,” Cowboys COO Stephen Jones said last week on The Fan. “You’d be crazy not to want to have him back and be a part of this thing.''\n\nAnd the tool that is franchise tag is the not-crazy and near-perfect way Pickens is all but guaranteed to remain in Dallas.",

    "title": "13 Free Agent Safeties the Detroit Lions MUST Consider",
    "description": "Here’s every free agent safety the Detroit Lions should consider.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions head into the 2026 offseason with one defensive reality staring them in the face: safety depth is no longer a luxury — it’s a necessity.\n\nBrian Branch is still recovering from a torn Achilles, an injury that often requires careful workload management even after a successful rehab. Meanwhile, Kerby Joseph has been dealing with a lingering knee issue that followed him through much of the season. While it hasn’t been labeled career-threatening, it’s also not something that simply “goes away” with a few weeks of rest.\n\nFor a defense that relies heavily on interchangeable safeties who can play deep, in the box, and in the slot, Detroit needs answers, and likely more than one.\n\nBelow is a look at 13 free-agent safeties the Lions should evaluate as they shape the 2026 roster.\n\nCurl is one of the most well-rounded safeties on the market. Still just 27 years old, he has quietly been one of the most consistent defensive backs in the league over the past four seasons.\n\nHe allowed only one touchdown in coverage in 2025 and owns an 81.8 PFF overall grade over the last four years — ranking 13th among qualifying safeties. Curl offers reliability, positional flexibility, and durability, making him a strong fit for Detroit’s system.\n\nAt 32, Byard remains one of the smartest and most instinctive safeties in football. He led the league with seven interceptions in 2025 and posted an 80.3 PFF grade while continuing to excel against the run.\n\nFor a Lions defense managing injuries, Byard’s leadership, communication, and play recognition could be invaluable, even if the contract is short-term.\n\nPeppers brings versatility few safeties can match.\n\nWhile his 2025 role fluctuated, his body of work from 2022–2024 tells a different story, when he earned a 90.1 PFF grade with elite marks against both the run and the pass. He has logged extensive snaps in the box, slot, and deep safety roles.\n\nAt 30, Peppers represents a high-upside signing if Detroit believes he can return to form in a more defined role.\n\nThompson has been a steady presence in Arizona’s secondary for five seasons.\n\nHe is one of the most reliable tacklers at the position, with a missed tackle rate of just 6.3% over the past two seasons. His coverage also improved in 2025, allowing a passer rating under 100 while breaking up five passes.\n\nThompson has never finished a season below a 64.0 PFF grade and would offer Detroit consistency and physicality.\n\nBryant has flown under the radar on one of the league’s best defenses.\n\nOver the past two seasons, he has produced a 72.7 PFF overall grade and has been especially effective against the run, earning an 80.9 run-defense grade since 2024. While not flashy, Bryant offers dependable depth and physical play.\n\nBlankenship’s 2025 season was a step backward, particularly in coverage, where he posted a 29.9 PFF grade and allowed a 116.8 passer rating when targeted.\n\nThat said, he remains a strong run defender and was a key contributor during Philadelphia’s 2024 Super Bowl run. At just 26 years old, Blankenship could be a bounce-back candidate in the right environment.\n\nHawkins may be the most underrated safety on the list.\n\nIn 2025, he ranked sixth among qualifying safeties with an 81.3 PFF grade, finishing second in run defense and seventh in coverage. At 28, Hawkins is squarely in his prime and could command significant interest across the league.\n\nDetroit would be adding a true three-down safety with momentum trending upward.\n\nBrisker is an intriguing reclamation option.\n\nWhile 2025 was his lowest-graded season, his first two years in the league showed his ability to play all over the defensive backfield. He’ll be just 27 in 2026 and still offers upside if he can return to earlier form.\n\nWashington’s 2025 season was derailed by an Achilles injury, but his 2024 performance cannot be ignored.\n\nThat year, he ranked fifth among safeties in coverage with an 86.1 PFF grade and showed the ability to play slot, box, and deep roles. His size (5-foot-8) limits him in some matchups, but his versatility fits Detroit’s defensive philosophy.\n\nGilman has quietly developed into a reliable starter.\n\nAfter being traded midseason, he finished 2025 with a solid 70.4 PFF grade. He brings experience, steadiness, and the ability to function in multiple safety alignments — a valuable trait given Detroit’s injury concerns.\n\nCross had a down year at the worst possible time, but the upside remains.\n\nHe ranked 28th among safeties in 2024 and doesn’t turn 25 until the start of the 2026 season. If Detroit believes the dip was situational, Cross could be a younger, affordable option with growth potential.\n\nCisco’s 2025 season ended early due to injury, but his body of work remains solid.\n\nHe has earned PFF grades above 60.0 in every season and will be just 26 in 2026. Cisco offers experience as a full-time starter and could rebound in a healthier situation.\n\nClark quietly enjoyed a bounce-back year in 2025.\n\nSplitting time between strong and free safety, he posted a 74.6 PFF grade and an excellent 86.5 run-defense grade. While coverage remains somewhat inconsistent, Clark brings toughness and versatility that Detroit values.\n\nBrian Branch’s Achilles recovery requires caution, and Kerby Joseph’s lingering injury adds uncertainty. Relying solely on internal options would be risky — especially for a defense built on safety versatility.\n\nDetroit doesn’t need panic moves, but it does need insulation, depth, and experience.\n\nThe Lions have no shortage of options at safety — from high-end starters like Kamren Curl and Jaylinn Hawkins to value veterans like Kevin Byard and Chuck Clark, and upside plays like Brisker and Cross.\n\nGiven the injury context, adding at least one veteran — and possibly two — feels inevitable.\n\nThe post 13 Free Agent Safeties the Detroit Lions MUST Consider appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

    "description": "The Super Bowl team's logo originates with a First Nations tribe in Canada.",
    "fullText": "Wallace Nagedzi Watts had been going to Seahawks games for almost three decades when a historical discovery helped supercharge his fandom - and deepened his connection to his indigenous roots.\n\n\"It kind of changed my whole life,\" says Watts, a prominent fan of the American football team who goes by the name Captain Seahawk.\n\n\"Because of the Seattle Seahawks I started getting back into my culture.\"\n\nSpeaking to the BBC while driving down to attend the Super Bowl game in Santa Clara, California, where the Seahawks are due to take on the New England Patriots, Watts says \"it's been my life's mission for the last 12 years to notify everyone that the Seahawks logo was copied from the Kwakwaka'wakw tribe on Vancouver Island\".\n\nThe discovery was made during the Seahawks last Super Bowl sting - coincidentally also against the Patriots - in 2014.\n\nAmid city-wide excitement, the Burke Museum in Seattle decided to investigate the origins of the Seahawks logo, which was chosen by the team's manager in the mid-1970s. A black-and-white photo of a ceremonial mask in an old art book revealed the inspiration behind the design, which was then traced to a collection at the Hudson Museum in Maine.\n\nThe museum sent the mask to Seattle on loan, where a ceremony was held featuring both tribal members and team representatives.\n\nThe mask, which was created in the late 1800s and was carved from cedar, had been in private collections since leaving Vancouver Island, British Columbia, where it was created by members of the Kwakwaka'wakw Nation, says Katie Bunn-Marcuse, the curator of Northwest Native Art at the Burke Museum.\n\nThe carving, which is known as a \"transformational mask\" and depicts the ancestral origins of one's family, was created around the time that Canada introduced a ban on many indigenous practices, in a move which decimated many tribes in western Canada.\n\nUsing the mask for its intended purpose, at large gatherings called potlaches, became a crime. Many people went to jail for their cultural practices, however, the Kwakwaka'wakw people continued to hold underground potlaches.\n\n\"The Indian Act banned people gathering and performing their songs,\" says Bunn-Marcuse, adding, that \"the potlatch was the economic and legal system of the coast\". The ban was lifted in 1951, and in 2015 Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission found that it was part of a \"cultural genocide\", which also included the notorious residential school programme, which separated families and erased local languages.\n\nWatts grew up on a reservation in Port Alberni on the west side of Vancouver Island, in his father's tribal community. But after the discovery of the logo's Kwakwaka'wakw origins, he decided to look into his mother's family history on the other side of the island.\n\nTravelling back to Vancouver Island, he set out on a series of tribal canoe journeys, where he reconnected with Kwakwaka'wakw family members and learned more about their cultural practices.\n\nDuring one trip, he was invited to take place in a ritual in which he was declared a \"warrior\", or guardian of the tribe's culture.\n\n\"I had to dance half-naked in front of a thousand people, and then I came back in warriors clothing. To me it's like being baptised as a Christian. It really changed my life.\"\n\nBruce Alfred, an artist living in Alert Bay, British Columbia, recalls when his cousin started showing up, inspired by his commitment to the Seahawks and his cultural heritage. He says that Watts is not the only person who has been inspired by the NFL team to look into their family history.\n\nAlfred was part of the Burke team that surveyed the mask, and confirmed that it was indeed Kwakwaka'wakw, and had been used in spiritual ceremonies before going into a private collection.\n\n\"After the potlatch ban they took everything away from our people,\" he says, adding that the goal of the government and missionaries was to \"annihilate and assimilate us - either one\".\n\nThe Seahawks are popular throughout Canada's western coast, where no other NFL team exists. Alfred says that many people in his village are Seahawks supporters, and that more people have been inspired to look into their heritage after discovering the team's connection. It comes amid a larger tribal movement to reconnect with the past.\n\n\"There is a resurgence of our people that are stepping up and they're learning the language, the culture, their own identity,\" he says.\n\nAlfred, and other indigenous people who spoke to the BBC, say that unlike other major league sports teams, the Seahawks logo has not sparked backlash because it respectfully borrows from indigenous culture, rather than plays in to racist stereotypes.\n\nThe display of indigenous cultural materials as artworks has been criticised by some tribal people, who see these as sacred tools for worship.\n\nAt the Kwakwaka'wakw exhibit at the University of British Columbia's Museum of Anthropology in Vancouver, one mask is kept under a sheet to symbolically show how some believe these objects should not be displayed, and only taken out for important occasions.\n\nThe debate is always ongoing for museums that display indigenous relics, says Bunn-Marcuse.\n\n\"In community, many of these masks are not brought out until the moment that they are needed,\" she says.\n\n\"Whenever we do our exhibits we do them collaboratively with input and advising by community members. So there are some masks that we no longer show because community has said those are not appropriate to be shown ever outside of their ceremonial context.\"\n\nOthers have critiqued the artwork for originating from a tribe that is hundreds of miles from Seattle, halfway to Alaska. The artwork of local peoples such as the Coast Salish could be used instead, they argue.\n\nQwalsius-Shaun Peterson, a Coast Salish artist from the Puyallup Tribe near Tacoma, Washington, is among many indigenous artists who have redesigned unofficial Seahawks logos in the style of their own local culture.\n\n\"People within the tribal communities are just really excited about native iconography of any kind,\" he says.\n\n\"Nobody takes offense\" to the official logo, he adds, adding that it is not a \"misrepresentation\" and instead \"borrows from\" indigenous art.\n\nWatts, who proudly boasts that he's the first person to arrive at games and the last to leave, is using his celebrity status as a superfan to fund raise for multiple charities.\n\nHe also cooks at a food bank, and mentors Native American youths in prison.\n\n\"I really had a different outlook on my entire life\" after connecting with the roots of the logo, Watts says.\n\n\"We're supposed to be the guardians of our tribe. We protect and provide.\"\n\nTotem pole to return to dockland home\n\nAn underwater mystery on Canada's coast\n\nA surprising way of showing gratitude",

    "fullText": "Los Angeles Dodgers superstar pitcher Blake Snell made a bold Super Bowl prediction during last week’s Fan Fest before the big game.\n\nIn an interview with the SportsNet LA TV crew, the Seattle native predicted that the Seahawks would win big over the New England Patriots.\n\nSnell predicted the Seahawks would beat the Patriots by 17 points.\n\nBlake Snell predicts the Seahawks are going to beat the Patriots by 17 in the Super Bowl ?\n\n?: @SportsNetLA pic.twitter.com/I3X9iK7hOP\n\n— Dodgers Nation (@DodgersNation) February 2, 2026\n\nThe 33-year-old was born and raised in Seattle and attended Shorewood High School in Shoreline, Washington. Snell made a name for himself in the Pacific Northwest before he was selected in the first round of the 2011 MLB Draft.\n\nThe All-Star pitcher grew up a Seattle Mariners fan and said that he will always have love for his hometown. In addition, Snell added that he will attend the Super Bowl, which is scheduled for Sunday, Feb. 7 at 3:30 PM PT. The game will be held in Santa Clara, California, at Levi’s Stadium, the home of the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nThe southpaw will now enter his second season in Los Angeles after he signed a five-year, $182 million contract. His deal includes a $52 million signing bonus and a conditional $10 million option for 2030.\n\nSnell touched on a handful of different topics at Fan Fest, including his availability at the start of the 2026 season. He shared with the media that the “plan” is to be ready for Opening Day.\n\n“I’ve been playing catch, been throwing. It feels good,” Snell said. “But I’m just going to take my time. Last year, I was rushing. I wanted to pitch so bad. But I’m going to take my time. The goal is to be ready Opening Day, but I’m going to take my time. I’ll know more once I’m [at Spring Training], throwing bullpens, pitching in games.”\n\nThe two-time Cy Young winner pitched an incredible 2.35 ERA in 2025, but was limited to only 11 starts due to left shoulder inflammation that kept him out for most of the season. Still, Snell played a pivotal role for the Dodgers in their quest for back-to-back titles.\n\nHe will do the same for L.A. in the 2026 season as they seek to become the first National League team to complete a three-peat.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's hard to even remember a time when LeBron James wasn't in the NBA.\n\nThe King has played for more than two decades between the Cleveland Cavaliers, Miami Heat and Los Angeles Lakers, but he really did play basketball before he was in the league, too.\n\nThere's a viral clip going around social media of James hooping when he was just 12 years old.\n\nMORE: Giannis Antetokounmpo's legacy doesn't change despite messy trade rumors\n\nMaybe the coolest part is just how special a passer James already was at that age. It's an ability that has almost seemed innate in him, and clearly, it has been, because it showed up before he was even a teenager.\n\nRare footage of 12 year old LeBron at the 1997 YBOA Championship game 👑 pic.twitter.com/otgDvCVcYi\n\n— LeBron Factory (@LeBronFactory) February 7, 2026\n\nMORE: 'Worst shooting form of all time' draws comparisons to Lonzo Ball, Shawn Marion\n\nIt looks like LeBron still has to hit another growth spurt there, but it's clear he's in control in every spot on the floor.\n\nA couple of his shots are pretty unconventional, but as the best player on the floor, you can fling some things up there and make them anyway.\n\nJames went on to be a storied high school player at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio.\n\nIn his day, players didn't have to go to college, so James was the No. 1 overall pick by the nearby Cleveland Cavaliers in the 2003 NBA Draft.\n\nMORE: This NBA Dunk Contest field is one of the worst ever\n\nBut yeah, there are some hoopers out there who can say they played against the King before he had fully gotten his crown.\n\nIt's so cool that these highlights exist, because they're quite the look into the past to see what LeBron was like before the whole world knew his name.\n\nMavericks are Cooper Flagg's team now, no questions asked\n\nReggie Miller made the weirdest NBA player comparison for Caitlin Clark\n\nWhy the Cavs had to trade for James Harden\n\nCavs' Nae'Qwan Tomlin didn't even play high school basketball\n\nCharles Barkley rips NBC and Michael Jordan",

    "fullText": "The early round talent in the 2026 NFL draft seems to align fairly well with where the Jacksonville Jaguars' greatest needs are.\n\nJordan Reid of ESPN recently put together his top 50 prospects big board, with a number of the players represented playing positions that should be on GM James Gladstone's radar this offseason.\n\nAs we look at the current state of the Jaguars' roster, this looks like it could be an offseason where GM James Gladstone invests fairly heavily into the defensive side of the ball.\n\nCornerback is a need with Montaric Brown and Greg Newsome both free agents. Defensive end and defensive tackle depth are needs -- not to mention that the Jaguars could use more pass rush juice from the interior.\n\nThen, depending on whether or not Devin Lloyd returns, that will determine how big of a need linebacker is.\n\nOn offense, adding to the offensive line and tight end positions could be on Gladstone's radar. Depth at most positions is always welcomed as well.\n\nAfter trading up for Travis Hunter in last year's draft, the Jaguars do not own their first-round pick this year. However, these rankings help us identify the strengths of this year's draft class.\n\nBelow is a positional breakdown of how Reid's top 50 big board shook out.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Jaguars Wire: 2026 NFL draft: How latest big board aligns with Jaguars needs",

    "fullText": "SANTA CLARA, Calif. — Rashid Shaheed is a perfect example of someone who takes advantage of their opportunities.\n\nWhen he was a little-recruited return specialist with track speed from the San Diego area coming out of high school, Shaheed ended up at Weber State under head coach Jay Hill and became a four-time All-American as a return specialist and receiving weapon.\n\nWhen he entered the NFL as an undrafted free agent — and was coming off an ACL injury that prevented him from working out in the pre-draft process — the New Orleans Saints saw Shaheed’s potential and signed him to a deal.\n\nHe turned that into a productive three-and-a-half years with the franchise.\n\nWhen the Saints traded him midseason during the 2025 campaign to the Seattle Seahawks, Shaheed adjusted again — and while he’s not as prominent in the Seahawks’ passing game as he was in New Orleans, Shaheed has made big plays in Seattle on special teams.\n\nSeveral of those plays have been important to the Seahawks’ postseason run.\n\nAnd now, he’s headed to Super Bowl LX with Seattle, where the Seahawks will face the New England Patriots on Sunday (4:30 p.m. MST, NBC) at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California.\n\nWhat will Shaheed do with that opportunity?\n\n“I feel like the journey has shaped me to be not only the player, but the person that I am today,” Shaheed told the Deseret News in an exclusive interview ahead of Super Bowl LX.\n\n“Obviously, coming in from an FCS school, Weber State, coming into the league with an injury, not knowing if I’m going to get the opportunity eventually, I just made the most of my opportunities, and that’s all I’ve done up to this point.”\n\nShaheed’s NFL career started modestly enough, as an under-the-radar addition during the 2022 offseason.\n\nIt didn’t take long for New Orleans to fall in love with the 6-foot, speedy Shaheed, though.\n\nDespite coming off an ACL injury, he ended up with 34 receptions for 488 yards and two touchdowns as a rookie.\n\nHis best receiving season thus far came in 2023, when he caught 75 passes for 719 yards and five touchdowns. He also earned Pro Bowl honors for the first time that season as a return specialist.\n\nA meniscus injury suffered in Week 6 of the 2024 season sidelined him the rest of that year, one where he was on pace to break his career numbers from that 2023 season.\n\nThen this year, there was a midseason trade from New Orleans to Seattle.\n\n“That’s an organization that gave me the opportunity to live out my dreams,” Shaheed said of the Saints franchise. “They treated me with so much respect, not only me, but my family — made us feel at home, made us feel welcome, and that just allowed me to go out there and just have fun and play the game that I love.\n\n“Obviously, I loved my time in New Orleans and I can’t thank the organization enough.”\n\nThe trade brought up a flood of emotions for Shaheed, who had 2,055 receiving yards and 12 receiving touchdowns with the Saints, though he went in confident he would make an impact with his new team.\n\n“It was a lot, obviously, my first time being traded, being a new team, new city, organization,” Shaheed said.\n\n“... I knew that I’d be able to get a grasp of the offensive game quickly. The transition has been smooth, and I appreciate my coaches and my teammates.”\n\nThere was a familiar face for Shaheed when he landed in Seattle: Klink Kubiak, the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator, who held the same role in New Orleans during the 2023 season.\n\nKubiak is the reported choice to take over as the Las Vegas Raiders’ next head coach.\n\nHaving Kubiak in Seattle, though, helped the transition for Shaheed. He’s impressed with how tough the Seahawks play, week in and week out.\n\n“Every man plays for the guy next to him, and that’s the recipe for winning, not only on offense, but defense and special teams. We all take pride in what we do and have fun doing it.”\n\n“Every man plays for the guy next to him, and that’s the recipe for winning, not only on offense, but defense and special teams. We all take pride in what we do and have fun doing it,” Shaheed said.\n\nWhile Shaheed’s biggest impacts in Seattle have come on special teams, he still had 15 receptions for 188 yards during the regular season.\n\nHe’s joined a wide receiver group that includes veteran Cooper Kupp, another FCS product who played at Eastern Washington, and shifty Jaxon Smith-Njigba, who was named The Associated Press NFL Offensive Player of the Year earlier this week.\n\n“With those guys, man, I just kind of sit back and watch them work,” Shaheed said.\n\nHaving the ninth-year pro Kupp, who earned a Super Bowl ring with the Los Angeles Rams, is “like having another coach” for Shaheed on the field and in the film room.\n\n“He knows what’s going to happen. He teaches us, me and Jax, what to look for in film, guys’ tendencies, all that,” Shaheed said. “I’m learning a lot from him.”\n\nShaheed has been impressed with the work ethic and approach that Smith-Njigba, the third-year pro, brings to the field every day.\n\n“Jaxon man, just the way he works, the way he shows up every day with a smile on his face and just the teammate that he is,” Shaheed said, of what stands out about the receiver who led the NFL in receiving yards (1,793) this season.\n\n“He’s gonna go out there and compete. It’s been a real pleasure working with these guys.”\n\nIt’s little surprise that Shaheed was one of the more popular interviews during Super Bowl media opportunities at the San Jose Convention Center this week — his big-play ability gets him noticed.\n\nSince arriving in Seattle, he’s produced multiple momentum-changing moments, and that popularity extends over to the Seahawks fanbase.\n\nHe’s scored three touchdowns on special teams, giving him five for his career. That earned Shaheed his second Pro Bowl citation.\n\nIt started with a 100-yard kick return for a touchdown in Week 14, when he took the second-half kick back for six points against Atlanta to break a 6-6 tie in an eventual 37-9 Seahawks win.\n\nShaheed kept upping the ante with his ensuing big returns.\n\nDuring a Week 16 matchup against the Rams, a critical game in terms of NFC seeding, the Seahawks trailed 30-14 midway through the fourth quarter.\n\nIn front of the electric Lumen Field home crowd, Shaheed changed the complexion of the game with a 58-yard punt return for a touchdown with 8:03 to play.\n\nSeattle forced overtime, then won 38-37 in the extra session in a game that helped the Seahawks earn the NFC’s top seed and home-field advantage in the playoffs.\n\nThen, in the divisional round with NFC West rival San Francisco coming to town, Shaheed started off the playoff contest with another electric play. His 95-yard touchdown on the game’s opening kickoff sparked a 41-6 win over the 49ers.\n\nWHAT JUST HAPPENED?! @RashidShaheed on the opening play 🤯\n\n📺: @NFLonFox pic.twitter.com/ZzMrFLI9l9\n\n— xz* - Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) January 18, 2026\n\n“I know the opportunities are going to come. My coaches believe in me to make those types of plays, and that just allows me to go out there and play free, play fast and just do what I’ve been coached to do,” Shaheed said.\n\n“(It’s a) big testament to the coaches for just allowing me to go out there and allow my ability to (make plays).”\n\nDuring Seattle’s postseason run, Shaheed has three kickoff returns for 147 yards (a 49-yard average), a 51-yard catch and three carries for 27 yards.\n\nThat 51-yard reception set up Seattle’s opening touchdown in the Seahawks’ 31-27 win over the Rams in the NFC championship game.\n\nHe’ll have opportunities to again make big plays in Sunday’s Super Bowl. In 59 previous Super Bowls, there have been 10 kickoff returns for touchdowns, but no one has ever returned a punt for a touchdown.\n\nFor Shaheed, the key Sunday against the Patriots is sticking together as a team.\n\n“Obviously, the magnitude is much, much bigger, but as long as we continue to do what we have all season, that’s just stick together, play all four quarters, we know that a team has to play us all four quarters, and we don’t believe that they can play with our style,” Shaheed said.\n\n“That’s with a lot of passion, aggression on a lot of big plays. We enjoy what we do, and it’s gonna be a fun game.”\n\nNo matter how Super Bowl LX ends up, Shaheed will represent Weber State in a positive way.\n\nHe credits his time with the Wildcats for helping him develop as a wide receiver and becoming a well-respected (and feared) return specialist.\n\n“That’s where I developed my game. Like I said, I had great coaches to learn from, great schemes. Obviously, I was able to make a lot of plays in the return game, but I grew so much as a wide receiver, and that was just taking a lot of time, spending time on my craft,” Shaheed said.\n\n“Being at a small school, it allowed me to work on that even more with limited distractions, small city. All it was was just work and continue to get better. And that’s how I’ve been able to progress.”\n\nShaheed is joining an elite group of Weber State alums who’ve reached the Super Bowl.\n\nThere are six former Wildcats who’ve won a Super Bowl ring, a list that includes Lee White, Darryl Pollard, Jamie Martin, Marcus Mailei, Paul McQuistan and Jonah Williams.\n\nShaheed will be only the fourth former Weber State player, though, to actually play in the Super Bowl. That more exclusive list includes Pollard, who started for the 49ers in Super Bowl XXIV, Al Pupunu and McQuistan.\n\nIt means a lot for Shaheed to represent his alma mater, and a victory Sunday would just make it sweeter.\n\n“I think that moment would just be bigger than just me,” he said about the possibility of earning a Super Bowl ring. “That would be an opportunity to let kids know that you can make it from anywhere. You don’t have to go to a Power Five school. You can go to an FCS school and make it happen.\n\n“And as long as you play the game the right way, teams will find you. Don’t be afraid to take that risk and just go anywhere you get an opportunity to play football and do what you love. Pursue it.”",

    "fullText": "Everyone accepts that golf etiquette may not be as strict at the WM Phoenix Open as it might be elsewhere, and that's ok with most people.\n\nThe constant buzz of the crowd and the eruption of noise after every tee shot at the 16th hole, for example, replaces the normal near-silence found on many golf holes around the world. Even fans getting a tad rowdy here and there at TPC Scottsdale is almost always in good fun.\n\nThe players competing in the People's Open have come to expect it and they say they love the atmosphere. They also say they wouldn't want this every week but for this week, it's all good.\n\nHowever, someone, in the name of creating content, decided to take things too far.

    "description": "An NFL insider has named the Detroit Lions as a serious trade contender for Raiders star Maxx Crosby. Here’s why the fit makes sense.",
    "fullText": "The Detroit Lions just got pulled into one of the biggest trade rumors of the entire offseason.\n\nDuring Super Bowl LX week, NFL insider Jeremy Fowler of ESPN named the Lions as one of several “natural would-be contenders” to pursue Raiders star defensive end Maxx Crosby, a revelation that immediately caught the attention of fans across the league.\n\nThe timing isn’t accidental. Earlier in the week, Fox Sports insider Jay Glazer reported that Crosby may be “done” with Las Vegas, setting off widespread speculation about where one of the NFL’s most relentless pass rushers could land next.\n\nDetroit is firmly in win-now mode, and the idea of pairing Crosby with Aidan Hutchinson is the kind of move that could change the balance of power in the NFC.\n\nCrosby has been one of the league’s most consistent edge defenders over the last seven seasons, earning two All-Pro selections and five Pro Bowl nods. Adding him opposite Hutchinson would give the Lions one of the most feared pass-rush duos in football — something this defense has lacked in high-leverage playoff moments.\n\nAccording to Fowler, Crosby’s priority is clear:\n\n“What has been made clear to me: Crosby wants to be a part of a winner. That’s the priority.”\n\nThat alone puts Detroit squarely in the conversation.\n\nFowler reported that trade interest in Crosby is massive, with more than a dozen teams expected to at least inquire. Among the contenders he specifically listed were the Bills, Lions, 49ers, Cowboys, and Ravens — a group made up almost entirely of Super Bowl-caliber teams.\n\nCrosby has remained loyal to the Raiders throughout his career, but Fowler noted that loyalty could soon be tested. Las Vegas is still far from contention, and Crosby is approaching the heart of his prime.\n\nAny Crosby trade would come at a steep cost — both in draft capital and money.\n\nIf Detroit were to acquire him, Crosby would carry a 2026 cap hit north of $30 million, though he does come with four years of team control after signing a three-year, $106.5 million extension last offseason.\n\nThat number is significant, but for a franchise pushing for its first Super Bowl appearance, it’s the type of financial swing that front offices sometimes decide is worth it.\n\nStatistically, Crosby is exactly what Detroit would be buying:\n\nProven durability and leadership\n\nThe Lions already have their defensive cornerstone in Hutchinson. What they don’t yet have is the elite second edge rusher who forces quarterbacks to pick their poison.\n\nThat’s why the Crosby rumors won’t die anytime soon.\n\nWhether Detroit actually pulls the trigger is another question — but according to ESPN, the Lions are very much in the mix.\n\nThe post NFL Insider Links Detroit Lions to Maxx Crosby appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

A middle in pitch was too much for Sydni Burko to lay off, as she gave the Herd two runs on a homerun. Dimitrijevic capped off the game with a strikeout, pushing the ‘Noles to 3-0 on the weekend.\n\nMarlee Gaskell made her Seminole debut, and led off with a strikeout.

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Senada Greca, founder of WeRise and cofounder of Aonic. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nAt least four times a week, I meet with Kim Kardashian for a personal training session. Today, we're focused on the upper body and core. Over our hour-and-a-half session, we'll do assisted pull-ups, hollow-body chest presses, face-pulls, and more. Kim likes to end most training sessions with a dead hang on the bar.\n\nI've been training Kim for three years now. I also help millions of other people (mostly women) through my training platform WeRise, and the fitness and nutrition videos I post on social media.\n\nStrength training is powerful, especially for women. Once you know the strength your body possesses, you'll understand how to feel good in your body, rather than feeling like you need to shrink or punish it. I know, because that's a change I've made myself.\n\nI'm the oldest of three girls, born in Albania. After the communist government was overthrown in the early 1990s, there was a lot of civil unrest. I remember the first time we heard gunshots. We hid under the bed, staying down for a long time.\n\nLuckily, my family won the green card lottery (Editor's note: The green card lottery is formally called the Diversity Visa Program, which provides up to 55,000 visas through random selection.), and we were able to immigrate to America in 1997 when I was 14. That helped set up a safer, more prosperous future for my sisters and me.\n\nAt the time, it was very challenging. I spoke with a heavy accent and dressed differently from my classmates in upstate New York, which led to a lot of bullying. Since I was the only one in the family who spoke English, I had to help my parents with legal documents, doctors' appointments, and getting my sisters into school. It was a lot.\n\nEverything in my life felt out of control. The one thing I could control was my eating, and not long after immigrating, I developed anorexia. Within a few years, I was also struggling with depression and anxiety. I was exercising, but only to punish my body.\n\nIn college, I connected with counseling and medication that helped me start getting healthy. The real turning point came when I was in my mid-20s and met a new primary care doctor. She was in her 50s, but running marathons every quarter. She taught me to think about exercise as a way to support mental health. I started running and became more physically and mentally stable.\n\nAbout 10 years ago, in my mid-30s, I started strength training. It changed my life, as I started using exercise to nourish myself.\n\nIn my immigrant family, financial security was always very important. I had a corporate job, and had never considered building something on my own — it just wasn't done.\n\nI started teaching yoga at night, and loved how my classes made people feel. In 2019, I began posting videos of my workouts, at first for myself. I was extremely consistent, which helped me grow a big following. When the pandemic happened, my following grew exponentially as people looked for workouts they could do at home.\n\nIn 2020, I launched my website and began charging for memberships. I quickly saw that my fitness business could be stable and successful. That gave me the courage to quit my corporate job to follow my passion. In the years since, my audience has only grown, and I've had amazing opportunities, like training Kim.\n\nToday, I'm in the best shape of my life — physically and mentally — at 43. I don't often talk about my age, because I feel ageless and don't want to define myself by a number. At the same time, I want to show that getting older doesn't have to mean winding down.",

    "description": "An anti-aging researcher went to Italy's longevity Blue Zone, and learned the best way to exercise for a longer, healthier life.",
    "fullText": "Steven Austad is a gym fanatic.\n\nAs the director of an anti-aging research nonprofit, he's deeply aware that exercise might be the closest thing we have to a longevity cure-all.\n\nThat's why he puts in about an hour a day on his bike or in the weight room as part of his longevity routine.\n\n\"I don't take any supplements. I don't even take a multivitamin, but I do spend a lot of time in the gym,\" he told Business Insider\n\nBut on a recent research trip, Austad met with centenarians who stayed spry with a completely different style of exercise, and it changed how he thinks about working out.\n\n\"I met all these hundred-year-olds and talked to them and watched them,\" he said. \"They get a lot of exercise, but it's not heavy exercise.\"\n\nHere's what we know about the healthiest kind of movement — and why being a little bit lazy may be the key to a long, healthy life.\n\nSardinia, Italy is one of the few places in the world where people regularly live to be 100 (or even older).\n\nKnown as Blue Zones, residents in these regions have traditions that scientists suspect are linked to enduring good health. Despite being spread around the globe, from Okinawa, Japan to Nicoya, Costa Rica, Blue Zones tend to share lifestyle habits like staying active, eating simple, mostly veggie-based superfoods, and building strong social communities.\n\nAustad traveled to Sardinia last year while working on a research paper about whether longevity hotspots live up to the hype. He wanted to test the theory that the high number of centenarians in Blue Zones is more about poor record-keeping than any exceptional anti-aging habits.\n\nWhat he found is that Sardinian elders are legit. Not only did he verify that residents of the island are active and vibrant into their 90s and 100s, but what he saw changed his own approach to healthy living.\n\nVillages in Sardinia are dotted throughout the region's rugged, mountainous terrain. As a result, people who live there are consistently hiking as part of their day-to-day activities to get around.\n\nCombined with other household chores like gardening, Sardinians tick all the boxes of longevity exercise without ever setting foot in a gym: lots of easy cardio, a bit of high-intensity effort from walking uphill, and muscle-strengthening movements using a full range of motion.\n\nAustad also spoke with a regenerative medicine doctor in the area, who specializes in staving off problems caused by injury or aging.\n\nShe told him that her patients are primarily young people who hurt themselves in the gym.\n\nAustad was stunned. All the 90- and 100-year-olds he had met were vibrant and healthy, while the younger generations needed medical care for pushing themselves too hard.\n\n\"That's just remarkable,\" Austad said. \"It convinced me that you don't have to be fanatical about this stuff.\"\n\nComing back from his Italian excursion, Austad couldn't help but rethink his own approach to exercise.\n\nPreviously, he liked hit the gym hard, leaning into the addictive rush of endorphins from intense exercise, and was constantly tempted to push for an extra set or more time working out. For him, rest days felt like a distraction.\n\n\"The occasional day off, it drives me nuts,\" he said. \"I've got this one bad knee, and if I overdo it with that knee, I pay the price. So that kind of keeps me real, tells me when I'm starting to overdo it.\"\n\nAustad still hits the gym regularly, with a mix of cardio and strength training that prioritizes core stability and everyday motions like pulling and pressing.\n\nBut since his recent studies on the Blue Zones, he said he's more likely to give himself a break without stressing about it.\n\n\"It makes me feel a little bit less guilty on the days when I decide that I shouldn't work out,\" Austad said.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mesha Griffith, the author of The Bedtime Mantra. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm a children's book author and mom. One day, I looked around the house and said, \"We have too much stuff.\"\n\nI got the idea to declutter for 30 days and get rid of 496 items from The Minimalists podcast. You have to get rid of one thing on the first day, two on the second day, three on the third, and so on.\n\nWe started it in 2021. My husband and I, along with some extended family, would do a group text at the beginning of the year and say, \"Here's what I'm going to get rid of,\" and send pictures back and forth to hold each other accountable.\n\nI decided to share the challenge with my Instagram followers. I posted my first decluttering challenge in January 2025, and then I did the second one in December 2025. Someone said I should draw a random number every day for the December challenge, and I had to purge however many items the number said, which turned out to be the perfect way to gamify it — and to hold myself accountable to post consistently on social media.\n\nAll of our stuff was once money, and I just started seeing everything as dollar signs. One day, I added everything up I was getting rid of that day and how much I originally spent on it, and it was $400.\n\nI'm more aware of the things I'm buying and bringing into my house, but even we have clutter. For example, we collect so much paper. I threw away three expired insurance cards. I threw away instruction manuals. You can find the PDFs online.\n\nEvery day since this went viral with my decluttering videos, I have had people waiting to see what number I'd pull the next day. I didn't want to let those people down. People even began doing their own challenge alongside me. It was more exciting to me that other people were inspired by my little challenge.\n\nIn the beginning, I'd get a lot of comments asking me whether I'd count this or that item, or how many items something like a Tupperware with a lid counted for.\n\nI'd tell them not to focus on that — it counts because it's causing you anxiety, stress, or agitation.\n\nThrowing stuff away was never an option. I had time, energy, and mental capacity to try to find new homes for as much stuff as I could.\n\nI'd resell on Facebook Marketplace, but it would need to go quickly. I didn't want to have a box of unsold stuff at the end of the month. If it didn't sell quickly, I'd take it to the thrift store, the free pantry, or other places. For example, I took towels, sheets, and blankets to the Columbus Humane Society, and I took building supplies and working appliances to Habitat for Humanity's ReStore.\n\nI don't think I'll do any more decluttering challenges for myself this year. I feel like I've run out of things to get rid of, but I would love to help either a family member or a friend declutter their home.",

He succeeded Shaun Maloney, but the former Preston North End, Plymouth Argyle and Bury boss won just 12 out of his 49 games in charge.\n\nPeterborough hit struggling Wigan for six\n\nWigan said Glenn Whelan and Graham Barrow will take charge of the first team on an interim basis while the club \"will work quickly to identify and appoint\" a new head coach.\n\nThe club also thanked Lowe for \"his efforts and wishes him all the best for the future\".\n\nLowe previously won promotion from League Two with Bury and Plymouth and finished 13th, 12th and 10th in the Championship with Preston.\n\nHaving arrived at the club at the tail end of the 2024-25 season, Lowe guided Wigan to a 15th-placed finish in the table.\n\nAfter winning against Northampton on the opening day of this season, Wigan's form soon tailed off as they secured just three victories from 17 matches in all competitions between late August and late November.\n\nWigan's next match is at home in the league against Reading on Tuesday (19:45 GMT) before they travel to face Premier League leaders Arsenal in the fourth round of the FA Cup on Sunday, 15 February (16:30).",

    "fullText": "Tries: Arundell (3), Earl, Roebuck, penalty try, Freeman Cons: Ford (4) Pens: Ford\n\nA remorseless England piled pain and points on Wales as they began their hunt for the Six Nations title with a 48-7 victory at Allianz Stadium.\n\nWing Henry Arundell, making his first start for his country in more than two years, scored a first-half hat-trick as England put themselves out of sight before the break.\n\nJosh Adams was picked out by Dan Edwards' precise punt for Wales's solitary try five minutes after the restart, but, for the most part, the one-way traffic continued to steamroll the visitors.\n\nTom Roebuck added to Ben Earl's first-half try, before the introduction of Marcus Smith, Henry Pollock and returning captain Maro Itoje energised England for the final quarter.\n\nEarl, as he did in the 68-14 romp in Cardiff last year, switched to midfield late on as England used the remaining game time to try out new patterns for the campaign to come.\n\nTommy Freeman, who scored in all five of England's games in the tournament last year, powered his way over in the last play of the game to keep that scoring streak going.\n\nWales have now won only two of their past 24 Test matches, while the domestic game is racked with uncertainty and rancour as the Welsh Rugby Union attempt to restructure four regional sides.\n\nOminously they take on France, the defending champions who took apart Ireland on Thursday night, next weekend.\n\nThe contrast to England is stark. The hosts' 12th straight victory was roared to the rafters and belief is swelling that their run can carry them to a first title since 2020.\n\nA far tougher test of those credentials awaits in the shape of a wounded Scotland in Edinburgh next weekend, but their mix of accurate attack and furious defence was hard to fault.\n\nIt was certainly too potent for Wales.\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nRugby Union Weekly: 'Ruthless' England thrash Wales\n\nWe let ourselves and people at home down - Lake\n\nEngland coach Steve Borthwick had forecast a barrage of high kicks from Wales and, with the Twickenham surface slick after heavy morning rain, he was soon proved right.\n\nWales scrum-half Tomos Williams hoisted the first box-kick after 40 seconds and Ellis Mee's chase of another sky-scraping boot earned Wales some prime field position.\n\nEngland were not averse to taking the same route, with George Ford testing Louis Rees-Zammit with a pair of spiral bombs early on.\n\nIt was soon clear though that only England had the urgency, intensity and power to capitalise from the chaos that followed.\n\nAfter George Ford's third-minute penalty, a first England try followed as Guy Pepper led the heavy brigade into contact and Ford zipped the ball wide for Arundell to stroll in.\n\nShipping points at the rate of one a minute, Wales's faint hopes were then torpedoed by two yellow cards in the space of 60 seconds.\n\nNicky Smith and fellow front-rower Dewi Lake were dispatched to the sin bin in quick succession as they illegally went after England at a line-out close to their line.\n\nUnderstaffed and underpowered, England picked Wales off.\n\nGiven the option of a penalty in the shadow of the posts to restart, captain Jamie George called for a scrum to the glee of the Allianz Stadium crowd.\n\nThe set-piece monstering duly followed, opening space for Ford to casually punt the ball wide for Arundell for his second. Ben Earl then bullocked over out wide as England made the most of their powerplay against 13 men.\n\nWales were restored to their full complement at 22-0 down, but they rarely managed to wrestle momentum their way.\n\nEngland's fourth try – Arundell's third – was largely self-inflicted as Dan Edwards lobbed a pass behind Rees-Zammit, allowing Dingwall to scoop up and feed Arundell.\n\nThe Bath wing had touched the ball only three times, and scored on each occasion, recording the team's first Six Nations hat trick since Jonny May against France in 2019.\n\nWith the contest all but over at 29-0 at half-time, both coaches will have spent the second half taking notes for weeks to come.\n\nThe experiment of running Freeman in midfield was a partial success for England. The Northampton man made more metres than any other England player as he hunted the ball and found space, although at least one chance went begging as he failed to release a galloping Roebuck outside.\n\nRichard Wigglesworth, now overseeing England's defence, will have relished how his side stubbornly shut out Wales, flying into tackles and defending their line as a source of pride.\n\nSteve Tandy's side kept their chins up and the defeat was not on the scale of the Cardiff capitulation last year.\n\nRees-Zammit's switch to full-back worked well as he came through an aerial examination and sliced through open field with strength and speed on one 55th-minute break.\n\nTomos Williams showed his class at scrum-half, while the back-row axis of Alex Mann, Josh MacLeod and Aaron Wainwright scrapped hard at the breakdown.\n\nBut this is a team early in development and short in depth.\n\nEngland unloaded their bench to loud acclaim from most of the 81,953 in attendance and, an almost immediate yellow card for Maro Itoje apart, their energy swamped Wales in the final quarter.\n\nWales have promise, but also much progress to make if they are to close the gap.\n\n'A brilliant start for England' - relive how 'ruthless' England thrashed Wales\n\nEngland: Steward; Roebuck, Freeman, Dingwall, Arundell; Ford, Mitchell; Genge, George, Heyes; Coles, Chessum; Pepper, Underhill, Earl.\n\nReplacements: Rodd for Genge (43), Cowan-Dickie for George (51), Davison for Heyes (51), Itoje for Coles (51), T Curry for Underhill (51), M Smith for Steward (65), Pollock for Roebuck (65), Spencer for Mitchell (67).\n\nWales: Rees-Zammit; Mee, James, B Thomas, Adams; Edwards, T Williams; Smith, Lake (capt), Griffin, D Jenkins, Beard, Mann, Macleod, Wainwright.\n\nReplacements: Carre for Smith (51), Francis for Griffin (51), Plumtree for Mann (51), Grady for Mee (53), Deaves for Macleod (53), Carter for Beard (70), Hardy for T Williams (79).\n\nSin-bin: Smith (17), Lake (18), B.

    "fullText": "Wales captain Dewi Lake says his side let themselves and the Welsh public down following Saturday's 48-7 Six Nations defeat by England.\n\nLake was one of four visiting players to be shown a yellow card as they were overpowered by Steve Borthwick's side, conceding seven tries.\n\nFormer Wales fly-half Dan Biggar criticised the first-half performance, describing it as \"nowhere near good enough for international rugby\" as Wales were trailing 29-0.\n\n\"We said at the end of the game that we let ourselves down and people at home down,\" said Lake.\n\n\"We spoke all week about what we were going to produce and we didn't do it.\n\n\"There's no other way to say it, there's no point just talking about things.\n\n\"We're massively disappointed with what we put on the field.\"\n\nWales conceded 16 penalties and were twice forced to play with just 13 men.\n\nTen of those penalties came in the first half with prop Nicky Smith and hooker Lake shown yellow cards within a minute of each other.\n\nCentre Ben Thomas and replacement flanker Taine Plumtree were then sent to the sin-bin in the second half.\n\nIt was Plumtree's sixth yellow card of the season and his third sin-binning in three games for Wales.\n\n\"Our discipline in the first 20 minutes was poor,\" said Lake.\n\n\"We were down to 13 men for nearly 20 minutes and against a team like England, that's going to be hard. It's hard to come back from 29-0 down.\"\n\nWales have conceded 65 penalties in Steve Tandy's first five games in charge, with 10 yellow cards and one red card, as the head coach admitted it was becoming a trend.\n\n\"We're hard on ourselves and we've got refereeing teams of three coming in to training,\" said Tandy.\n\n\"It's something you can't run away or hide from.\n\n\"We'll go back, look at it and the reasons why, learn as a group why we feel we're under that type of pressure and giving away those sorts of penalties.\"\n\nArundell scores hat-trick as England heap misery on Wales\n\n'A brilliant start for ruthless England' - reaction after seven-try England thrash Wales\n\nSince the 2023 World Cup, Wales have a wretched international record of 22 defeats in 24 Tests, with the only two victories coming against Japan in 2025.\n\nIt has been 1,064 days since Wales' previous Six Nations victory, against Italy in Rome in March 2023, with this latest hammering a 12th successive loss in the tournament.\n\nWales host favourites France in eight days in Cardiff having not won a home match in the tournament since defeating Scotland in February 2022.\n\nTicket sales are slow for the three home games with thousands still available for the visit of Les Bleus.\n\n\"Every voice matters to us at the minute, every fan that can get behind us,\" said Lake.\n\n\"We know we're going to be better next week. We've spoken a lot about wanting to excite a nation.\n\n\"We didn't do it today but we've got another four games in this tournament.\"\n\nLake says the effort of the squad can not be questioned but admits the quality was not there against England.\n\n\"This group will fight for each other all day,\" said Lake.\n\n\"There's no question of effort. It's not hard to get that out of this group or keep these players going.\n\n\"They love wearing this jersey and want to work hard.\n\n\"That's why this group is special. For us, it's about turning it into accuracy and flipping that into our favour.\"\n\nWelsh players are facing a lot of off-the field issues with the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU) threatening to cut a professional men's side and Ospreys under threat of disappearing as a top-tier team.\n\nLake was one of four Ospreys' players in the 23-strong match-day line-up with four \n\n\"It's not good enough to use that as an excuse,\" said Lake.\n\n\"There is a space which is open for the boys if they want to discuss it.\n\n\"We have spoken about it as a group but the boys have their heads down wanting to do their best for Wales.\"",

    "fullText": "Usman Nurmagomedov outclassed Alfie Davis before submitting the Briton in the third round to retain his PFL lightweight title in Dubai.\n\nRussia's Nurmagomedov marched Davis down throughout, attacking with an array of kicks, before securing a key takedown midway through the fight and putting him to sleep with an unorthodox arm triangle choke.\n\nThe win extends 27-year-old Nurmagomedov's unbeaten record to 22 fights and marks his fifth world title defence.\n\nDavis, 33, won the PFL's lightweight tournament last year to earn the title shot but was a big underdog in the fight and rarely looked as if he would trouble Nurmagomedov.\n\n\"I won how I planned, I made him tired, I made him work, I made him grapple and the win was going to come,\" said Nurmagomedov.\n\n\"Thank you for my father, he is here with me. Everything I have in this life is from him.\"\n\nDavis came into the fight following his win over Nurmagomedov's team-mate Gadzhi Rabadanov in August and he carried the confidence he earned from that contest into the title bout.\n\nDavis wore a beaming grin as he danced his way to the cage with a swagger, in front of booing fans who were largely in support of Nurmagomedov.\n\nNurmagomedov submits Davis in PFL title fight - reaction\n\nWatching Davis at cage-side was two-time heavyweight boxing world champion Anthony Joshua, who was making one of his first public appearances since taking time away from the spotlight after being involved in a car crash in December.\n\nIn contrast to Davis, Nurmagomedov wore a stern, focused expression as he made his walkout, flanked by coach, cousin and mentor Khabib Nurmagomedov and two-division UFC champion Islam Makhachev.\n\nDavis embraced the boos from fans as he was introduced before the fight, who chanted 'Usman Usman' when the contest got under way.\n\nFrom the moment the bell rang, Nurmagomedov stalked Davis, attacking with leg and high kicks, while Davis searched for opportunities to counter.\n\nDavis maintained his confidence in the face of Usman's suffocating presence, jiving and weaving before throwing strikes but failed to land anything of note that hurt the Russian.\n\nNurmagomedov showed his evasiveness and he dodged a spectacular spinning back-kick from Davis, before proving his advantage in the grappling as he secured multiple takedowns.\n\nWith just over half a minute remaining in the third round, Nurmagomedov landed the fight-defining takedown as he took Davis' back before putting him to sleep with an unusual arm triangle-rear-naked choke hybrid.\n\nIn his post-fight interview Nurmagomedov, who is regarded as one of the best fighters outside the UFC, made no mention of possible opponents he would like to face next.\n\nOther than a trilogy fight with Irishman Paul Hughes, who lost on points to Nurmagomedov in two close five-round fights last year, there are no standout contenders.\n\nAnother option for Nurmagomedov could be Rabadanov, but it is rare for fighters who train at the same gym to fight each other.\n\nThe most enticing fight for Davis next is also Hughes, who has not competed since defeat by Nurmagomedov in October.\n\nDavis will not be able to defend his 2025 tournament crown because the PFL is not continuing the format in 2026.\n\nEarlier on the card, Britain's Luke Trainer submitted Australia's Rob Wilkinson in the first round of their light-heavyweight bout via a guillotine choke.\n\nVictory ended a 17-month absence for 29-year-old Trainer as he earned his fifth straight win.\n\nFellow Briton Haider Khan was on the wrong side of a guillotine choke as he suffered a first-round defeat by Brazil's Jhony Gregory in their middleweight bout.\n\nIn the co-main event, Russia's Ramazan Kuramagomedov beat countryman Shamil Musaev on points to win the PFL welterweight title.\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - will not be able to wear their new helmets after the Court of Arbitration for Sport said they do not comply with the sport's rules around shape.",
    "fullText": "The British skeleton team - among Team GB's best hopes for medals at the Winter Olympics - will not be able to wear their new helmets because they do not comply with the sport's rules around shape.\n\nThe British team had appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) on Thursday to overturn the decision by the sport's governing body - the International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation (IBSF).\n\nBut Cas say the helmet is a departure from the standard helmet shape and has clearly been designed to specifically enhance aerodynamic performance because the back of the helmet protrudes.\n\nThe British Bobsleigh and Skeleton Association (BBSA) stressed that the helmet was designed with safety in mind and to comply with new safety regulations due to be introduced by the IBSF at the start of the 2026-27 season.\n\nThose rules are not in place at the Olympics but British skeleton have essentially tried to get ahead of the curve by designing and using their new helmet in Italy.\n\nInstead they will wear the ones they wore during the last World Cup season.\n\nA picture seen by BBC Sport shows that the helmet is pointed at the back - similar in appearance to a track cycling helmet.\n\nNatalie Dunman, executive performance director at the BBSA, said: \"Based on the strength of the case we put forward, naturally we are disappointed in [the] decision.\n\n\"However, this does not affect our final preparations and nor has the discourse affected the athletes' focus or optimism going into the Games.\n\n\"Our athletes have been winning medals all season, and throughout the Olympic cycle, in their current helmets and we remain in a strong position to continue that trend.\"\n\nWhen asked about the helmet prior to the verdict, Team GB's skeleton racers said they had no preference on which helmet they used at the Olympics.\n\nThey arrive at the Games as heavy favourites to win medals with world champion and overall World Cup winner Matt Weston leading the charge for gold while compatriot Marcus Wyatt is also fancied to go well.\n\nThe British team wore the new helmets at a training session last week in Switzerland with the IBSF ruling them out on 29 January before the BBSA appealed against the ban on Thursday.\n\nOfficial skeleton training in Cortina begins on Monday with the men's event beginning on 12 February, while the women's starts on 13 February and the team event is on 15 February.\n\nThe helmet is the most important bit of kit both for safety and aerodynamics - how quickly the slider can travel down the track.\n\nDoctor Bryce Dyer, a professor of sport technology at the University of Bournemouth, says that because skeleton is head first it is essential that the helmet is aerodynamic to cut through the air.\n\n\"The airflow over that section is really, really important,\" he said. \"Any kind of gain they can make with the shape and the general performance of it, then obviously the higher the speed gap is going to achieve and therefore the better chances of the medal.\n\n\"The funny thing with aerodynamics is that the faster you go, the more resistance actually gets thrown against you. So you need the most aerodynamically efficient shape you can obtain.\"\n\nIt is here that the British team's case appears to have been decided, with Cas agreeing with the IBSF that the overall shape incorporates prohibited spoilers (attachments), protruding edges or aerodynamic elements.\n\n\"Even that [aerodynamic helmet] will only yield a very, very small increase in velocity. But that could be just enough,\" said Dyer.\n\nWith the margin between winning gold and going home empty handed \"hundredths of a second\", two-time world champion Weston knows that innovation in aerodynamics is key to the \"minor gains\" needed.\n\nWhile the BBSA say they are disappointed with the decision, the British team know they are in a strong position without the new helmets.\n\nBetween them, Weston and Wyatt have won all seven World Cup races this season while three women have qualified for the Olympics for the first time in British history.\n\nWhen discussing the matter before the verdict was announced, Wyatt, Weston and women's skeleton rider Tabitha Stoecker all said they did not mind which helmet they wore at the Games.\n\n\"All of our success has been with the other helmet - for me this is the tiniest little thing in the background,\" Wyatt said.\n\n\"I'm not worried, whatever we end up wearing I think we're in with a great shout of bringing some medals home.\"\n\nThree-time overall World Cup winner Weston added: \"I have other things I can focus on and other things I'm working on to maximise my performance coming into the Olympics.\n\n\"If these new helmets get though then great it's an added bonus. But if not then we are in a pretty solid place.\"\n\nStoecker added: \"We've been competing in our regular training helmets all year and having amazing results.\n\n\"With or without that [helmet] I think we all feel really confident in the team and in our abilities and what we're going to be able to lay down at the Games.\"\n\nTwo-time Olympic skeleton champion Lizzy Yarnold said: \"It's good to get the decision out of the way before official training has begun. The athletes are likely to be unaffected mentally and their preparation is unaffected.\n\n\"I personally like to see developments in elite sport, innovation is important, maybe this process will develop the rules further and create more clarity within the rules, and therefore allow for some innovation.\"\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "By scoring a first-half hat-trick against Wolves on Saturday, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent, putting himself firmly in the England conversation.",
    "fullText": "With the World Cup four months away, Cole Palmer provided a timely reminder of his talent on Saturday.\n\nThe Chelsea forward scored a first-half hat-trick as the Blues beat bottom-of-the-table Wolves 3-1 to remain firmly in the hunt for a top-four finish.\n\nTwo of those goals were penalties, with Palmer displaying his typically ice-cool demeanour to send the goalkeeper the wrong way both times.\n\nPalmer has been dogged by a groin injury this season, and the three goals almost doubled his tally for the campaign - going from four Premier League goals to seven.\n\nThe performance also puts him firmly in the England squad conversation.\n\n\"If he's impacting games, like we know he can, from now to the end of the season, he's a sure thing to be in the squad,\" former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy told BBC Sport.\n\n\"He can play wide, he can play as a 10. He's just so good on the ball and classy and simply doesn't fear anybody.\n\n\"Even if you bring him off the bench, you know he can do unbelievable things. He can win you a game in a heartbeat.\"\n\nPalmer celebrated his opening goal against Wolves by covering his ears - a response, perhaps, to recent reports suggesting he is unsettled in London.\n\nThe former Manchester City player has had a difficult campaign in which injury has seen him in and out of the side, while under new head coach Liam Rosenior he has had his playing minutes carefully managed.\n\nSince Rosenior became Chelsea boss at the start of this year he has often faced questions about Palmer's form, fitness and state of mind.\n\nThis performance provided something of a direct response to those questions, but key for Palmer will be keeping it up.\n\n\"We know what a world-class player he is. He's played a lot of football over the last year with not much rest,\" said Rosenior.\n\n\"When he's at his best, he's unstoppable. I'm delighted to be working with him.\"\n\nThis is, after all, a player who scored twice in the Club World Cup final less than six months ago, and across the two seasons prior to this one totted up 37 Premier League goals.\n\nIf Palmer can now build momentum, he will be hitting form at just the right time.\n\nHe was a key player for England at Euro 2024 but has made just one appearance under current boss Thomas Tuchel - in a 1-0 win against Andorra last June.\n\nInjuries have been a factor, but there is also competition for places - with the likes of Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham rivalling him for the number 10 role.\n\n\"At the moment it looks like Morgan Rogers and Jude Bellingham will be the two who are ahead of him,\" said former Manchester City defender Nedum Onuoha on BBC Final Score.\n\n\"I'd be looking to find a way to get him in the side.\"\n\nWhen asked if he would select Palmer for England, former Blackburn and Chelsea striker Chris Sutton was a little more blunt: \"Not at the minute, no. I'd play Rogers.\"\n\nEngland have two more friendlies lined up before the World Cup - against Uruguay on 27 March and Japan four days later - so that international camp will offer a big chance for players such as Palmer to impress Tuchel.\n\n\"I don't think Cole [Palmer] is at his best yet,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Like a lot of players, when you have had a bad injury and you've had quite a lot of time out, it does take game time to get your rhythm and your sharpness back.\n\n\"He really needs to start playing regularly to force his way into the England squad and team, because at the moment with Morgan Rogers doing what he's doing, and other players playing well, he's got a battle on his hands.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Britain's Katie Boulter claimed her fourth WTA Tour title with a three-set victory over Tamara Korpatsch at the Ostrava Open on Saturday.\n\nThe British number four, who had dropped to 120th in the world rankings, came back strongly from a set down in the final to beat German Korpatsch 5-7 6-2 6-1.\n\nBoulter's positive performance in the Czech Republic this week after an inconsistent 2025 season means she will return to the top 100 at number 84.\n\nThe 29-year-old split from her long-time coach Biljana Veselinovic last year and appointed Michael Joyce at the start of 2026.\n\nShe dedicated the win to her new coach Joyce, saying: \"We're only a few weeks into business right now Mickey but we've got one in the bag.\"\n\nRaducanu well beaten in Transylvania Open final\n\nBoulter then joked: \"And it was on your birthday week. Massive week for you, 53 years old, big one, so that was your present to you.\n\n\"I hope we can keep doing a lot of work.\"\n\nThe title win was in contrast with fellow Brit Emma Raducanu, who was well beaten by Romanian Sorana Cirstea in the Transylvania Open final.\n\nBoulter has lost only one of the five WTA finals she has reached and her win in Ostrava will be added to her two Nottingham titles (2023 and 2024) and her triumph in San Diego two years ago.\n\nDespite losing three games in a row on her way to dropping the first set, plus the opening game of the second, Boulter was able to regroup and take the final to a decider.\n\nFrom there, she was fully in control and broke 30-year-old Korpatsch's serve three times on her way to a first trophy in nearly 15 months.\n\n\"To my stable team, my whole family back home...

    "description": "Nick Ball is beaten for the first time in his professional career in front of hometown fans in Liverpool, relinquishing his world title.",
    "fullText": "Nick Ball's reign as WBA featherweight world champion ended in dramatic fashion as the British boxer was stopped in the 12th round by Brandon Figueroa in front of stunned home fans in Liverpool.\n\nAfter 11 closely contested rounds, in which Ball was at times typically bullish on the inside and Figueroa responded with relentless volume, the fight turned in an instant.\n\nSeconds into the final round at M&S Bank Arena, Figueroa landed a flush straight left that sent Ball crashing to the canvas. The 28-year-old beat the count but looked unsteady, and a sharp follow-up combination forced the referee to wave it off.\n\nUgly scenes followed as beer and objects were thrown towards the ring after a brief altercation, with members of Ball's team unhappy about the manner of Figueroa's celebrations while the deposed champion was recovering.\n\n\"I'm sorry [for the celebration], we didn't mean anything, we were just excited. Sorry about that,\" Figueroa said.\n\n\"Big shout out to Nick Ball, he is a great Liverpool champion and one of the best England have ever had. I have nothing but respect for him.\"\n\nIn his fourth defence of the world title, Ball - who left the arena without giving a post-fight interview - suffered the first defeat of his professional career, having previously gone 24 fights unbeaten with one draw.\n\nThe result scuppers his hopes of unification bouts and brings to an end a positive run of results for British boxing on the global stage following Dalton Smith and Josh Kelly's world title triumphs in January.\n\nAmerican Figueroa, meanwhile, becomes a three-weight world champion in his 30th pro bout.\n\nFigueroa stops Ball to claim WBA title from Briton - reaction\n\nFigueroa, 29, lived up to his moniker, 'Heartbreaker', on a deflating and sorrowful night for 'Wrecking' Ball and the Liverpool crowd.\n\nThe challenger was met by a chorus of jeers on his ring walk, the 7,500-capacity arena close to full and firmly partisan. Figueroa blew kisses to his loved ones and stood calmly in his corner as the noise swelled for Ball.\n\nThe Kirkby-born fighter was given a proper hometown reception. From John Conteh to Natasha Jonas, Liverpool has never been shy of producing world champions, and Ball is the latest to have carried on that proud tradition.\n\nThe contest began at a frantic pace. Ball threw 145 punches across the opening three rounds - including sharp uppercuts in the first and second – with Figueroa throwing 204 times.\n\nAt just 5ft 2in, Ball conceded seven inches in height but dismissed the idea that was a disadvantage beforehand, insisting he preferred \"punching up\" at taller opponents.\n\nAs blood trickled from the champion's nose and reddened his mouth, Figueroa continued to press and appeared the fresher man at the halfway mark.\n\nBall responded with a blistering flurry in the eighth. Figueroa winced, smiled and fired back to the body. With some tight rounds, the fight felt finely poised and destined to go to the scorecards.\n\n\"Championship rounds. This is your territory now,\" Ball's corner told him.\n\nThere was nervousness in the arena, but nobody predicted such an abrupt ending.\n\nWith Ball scrambling on the floor after the initial left, he admirably rose on the count of nine.\n\nBut Figueroa sensed the finish and unloaded - a left-right-left combination completing the job for the Texan.\n\nDuring the melee that followed the stoppage, Andrew Cain, a member of Ball's team who won his own fight on the undercard, appeared to aim a kick at one of Figueroa's cornerman.\n\nTensions were calmed quickly, and scorecards revealed the knockout was the icing on the cake for Figueroa, who was ahead of two of the three scorecards at the time of the stoppage.\n\nBall has come a long way since making his professional debut in a Liverpool nightclub and had won four fights in a row since his controversial split draw with Rey Vargas in March 2024.\n\nOf all reigning male world champions from Britain, he was the only one to have defended his title.\n\nBut that run has come to an end in the most disappointing fashion.\n\nBall's fan-friendly style had made him one of the country's most watchable fighters, with unification bouts and big-name opponents on the horizon.\n\nA potential super-fight with Japan's pound-for-pound star Naoya Inoue, the undisputed super-bantamweight champion, had also been on Ball's wishlist.\n\nInstead, Ball ran into an inspired Figueroa and must now process both the first defeat of his career and the loss of his world title.\n\nHow he responds - physically and mentally - will shape the next chapter, and overcoming this setback may prove a defining test of his character.\n\nBruce Carrington (WBC), Angelo Leo (IBF) and Rafael Espinoza (WBO) hold the other world titles in the division, but would any of them be eager to step in with Ball when he has no world title to offer?\n\nBall could seek a rematch with Figueroa, although the American might be reluctant to take that option after his knockout win.\n\nBoxing schedule and results 2026\n\nWatch every Born to Brawl episode\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Steve Borthwick has the pleasure of nit-picking through fine details after his England side swat aside Wales in their Six Nations opener.",
    "fullText": "Whether it was a deliberate, pointed pick, we'll never know.\n\nBut as Wales' replacements jogged out ahead of their team for the start of the second half, the Allianz Stadium DJ launched into the Kaiser Chiefs' noughties shout-a-along I Predict a Riot.\n\nAt 29-0 up, it wasn't the boldest forecast.\n\nAnd in the end, Wales showed enough fight and quality to prevent England vandalising their national pride as they did in Cardiff last March.\n\nBut, by any measure, England's 48-7 win was a walloping.\n\nBall in hand, they made nearly twice the metres of the visitors.\n\nWales were spinning like tops in defence, chasing back after 16 line-breaks. The visitors made only six in the opposite direction.\n\nEngland had almost 60% of territory. By 25 minutes in, Wales had a decimal point of hope. At best.\n\nAfterwards, England head coach Steve Borthwick thought the scoreline stat should have been even more lopsided in England's favour.\n\n\"I thought we defended exceptionally well, we kicked really well and we scored some nice tries, but I think we left a lot out there on the grass.,\" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"We'll review this game and say there's a load of things we could do a lot better. Those are the things we need to step up next week.\n\n\"Second half we were in the 22 a lot but didn't come away with points on as many occasions as we'd have liked.\"\n\nUltimately, England made enough stick to the scoreboard to sit atop the Six Nations table after round one.\n\nMore interesting than the early-stage standings to Borthwick will be the lessons, albeit limited and caveated by the quality of the opposition, that he can take.\n\nHenry Arundell, all low-slung power and top-end speed, inevitably took the headlines after helping himself to a first-half hat-trick.\n\nThe 23-year-old, who, as a teenager, scored a try with his first touch of the ball in the Test game, has a sky-high international strike-rate.\n\nThat stat is inflated by his five against Chile in the last Rugby World Cup, as well as Saturday's work, but his ability to turn a half-break into a full five points is precious.\n\nWhen Fraser Dingwall scooped up and shovelled the ball to him for England's fourth try of the afternoon, the cover was instantly blow-torched.\n\nArundell's improvement under the high ball this season - most notably in Bath's win over Saracens opposite Noah Caluori - and defence, are qualities that have been coached into him. His fast-twitch physicality, though, is an ability beyond anyone's gift.\n\nWith the amount of slapped-back kick-chase and subsequent broken-field chaos in the modern game, it is a more of a lethal weapon than ever.\n\nArundell scores hat-trick as England heap misery on Wales\n\nRugby Union Weekly: 'Ruthless' England thrash Wales\n\n'A brilliant start for England' - relive how 'ruthless' England thrashed Wales\n\nOllie Chessum is unlikely to see his name up in the same lights, but, with Maro Itoje starting the game on the bench, the second row filled any void with a performance containing more lungs and heart than a matchday burger.\n\nBen Earl has made excellence his everyday. For someone who is not a natural number eight, he is also up there as the world's best in the position.\n\nThe 28-year-old, who has played more of his rugby at open-side flanker, made 17 carries and 78 metres, while also finishing joint top of the tackle stats with Guy Pepper and nicking a turnover.\n\nHenry Pollock's energy makes him an ideal and wildly popular second-half introduction. Would his pace and breakdown poaching ability be as effective from the start? After six appearances off the bench, might Borthwick be tempted to find out?\n\nThe most intriguing issue, though, as England roll on towards Edinburgh is Tommy Freeman.\n\nHe had a fine game in many ways, a physical, pacy presence at outside centre, who dovetailed predictably well with Northampton team-mate Dingwall. He was England's leading metre-maker by a distance.\n\nBut, converted from wing, there is, perhaps inevitably, a clunkiness sometimes in the wide channels. Tom Roebuck was one team-mate left waiting for a pass that never came.\n\nFreeman's superb aerial ability is less useful in midfield, while his head-down finishing ability came to the fore best when he was shifted back to the wing late on, pinballing through tackles as he dunked down England's seventh and final try.\n\nHis midfield move, started a year ago, was prompted by a lack of other options.\n\nNow, with Ollie Lawrence back from an Achilles tendon tear, Dingwall impressing again at 12, Max Ojomoh and Seb Atkinson in the equation and Joe Marchant and Benhard Janse van Rensburg approaching eligibility, the centre cupboard looks less bare.\n\nSometimes courage is needed to see a plan through. Conversely, sometimes wisdom is needed to know when to change one.\n\nFreeman's centre role feels like one to persevere with for now, but not blindly.\n\nBorthwick knows that with France, who found a level unreached by their rivals in beating Ireland, awaiting in the final round, that sort of tinkering, tuning and fine-margin call will need to be right if England are to reach the glorious destination they want.\n\nWe let ourselves and people at home down - Lake\n\n'Townsend on the ropes after romp in swamp'\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nPower, width & barnstorming Earl - how England attack sparked into life",

    "description": "BBC Sport looks at how things are shaping up as the fight for Premier League survival hots up.",
    "fullText": "For the first time since before Christmas, just three points will separate the teams in 17th and 18th at the end of a Premier League weekend.\n\nWest Ham's 2-0 victory at Burnley has at last dragged them to within touching distance of Nottingham Forest again, with the Hammers enjoying a mid-season renaissance by winning three of their past four matches.\n\nWhile Wolves and Burnley are cut completely adrift, Nuno Espirito Santo's team are seemingly keeping the relegation battle alive single-handedly.\n\nThere have only been 10 occasions since the Premier League was formed in 1992-93 that the fight for survival has not gone down to the final day - although five of those have occurred in the last decade.\n\nSo after some damp squibs in recent years, are we set for an unusually exciting end to the campaign at the bottom of the table?\n\nBBC Sport looks at how things are shaping up as clubs attempt to avoid the dreaded drop into the Championship.\n\nWhile Wolves are not mathematically down yet, they are propping up the table on a meagre eight points from 25 matches and sports analytics and data experts Opta rank their chances of relegation as 99.99%.\n\nThat also effectively means the West Midlands club are in a scrap to avoid the unwanted record of winning the fewest points in a single Premier League campaign, currently held by Derby, who managed just 11 in 2007-08.\n\nMeanwhile, Burnley's loss to the Hammers means there is a 99.4% chance they will spend next term in the second tier of English football.\n\nThere was an air of frustration around Turf Moor on Saturday with the home fans castigating the players and calling for Scott Parker's dismissal as boss after watching their team fail to win for a 16th consecutive match.\n\n\"Whether we fail or we don't fail, we come through this for sure,\" said Parker.\n\n\"I'm really sorry that I can't promise we'll be better for it with a win or with staying in this division but the longer the journey is, we will be better for it.\"\n\nHammers boss Nuno said his side \"are still in the same situation\" and called on them to \"focus on\" themselves after winning in Lancashire.\n\nHaving gone 10 Premier League matches without a win, West Ham appear to have built some momentum from Callum Wilson's dramatic late goal at Tottenham on 17 January.\n\nAnd they will feel they can tackle their remaining 13 games with renewed optimism despite being ranked with a 75.77% chance of going down, with Nuno also having the experience of guiding Nottingham Forest to safety on the final day of the 2023-24 campaign.\n\n\"West Ham look more like a Nuno team over the last few weeks,\" said former Liverpool and England midfielder Danny Murphy, who is a pundit on Saturday's Match of the Day.\n\n\"They have won three out of four and have all the momentum. Crysencio Summerville is playing out of his skin and Jarrod Bowen is always going to chip in, plus they've signed two strikers.\n\n\"All of a sudden they look like a team that can score goals and that means you don't have to rely so heavily on keeping them out the other end.\n\n\"However, you'd always rather have the points in the bag than doing the chasing as you can't have many slip-ups - you have to keep on getting points.\"\n\nWhile Forest are just three points above West Ham in 17th, Sean Dyche will hope his side has the quality to pull clear having spent around £200m on players over the last 12 months.\n\nOpta rank the two-time champions of Europe as having a 15.3% chance of being relegated and it is likely Dyche will have to juggle his resources due to the club's continued involvement in the Europa League, where they are due to face Fenerbahce in the knockout play-offs for the last 16.\n\n\"Too many times recently, I've seen Nottingham Forest look passive,\" said Murphy.\n\n\"Whether that's legginess from the amount of games in which Sean Dyche has had to play the same players. He gave fringe players the chance to stake their claim against Wrexham and they didn't take it, so he's had to pick the same eight or nine week in week out.\n\n\"I've done it myself and it's hard trying to play every few days and playing to your best, especially under pressure of relegation. Plus, they are trying to manage Europe as well.\"\n\nLeeds, who claimed a valuable win over Forest on Friday, appear to be in the best form of the three sides on 29 points.\n\nCrystal Palace, who travel to Brighton on Sunday, appear to be in disarray after the departure of captain Marc Guehi and manager Oliver Glasner's confirmation he will be leaving the club at the end of the season.\n\nTottenham have also taken just four of the past 21 points available and have not won a top-flight game since the start of the year.\n\n\"Palace have got a scrap on their hands as confidence is draining,\" added Murphy.\n\n\"I'm like the majority and think Tottenham will be OK even though the results don't say it. Their squad and the quality they've got will come good and they will get enough points.\n\n\"Leeds, for me, are the ones who will be safe given the way they have played in the last two or three months. They have some really nice momentum. And we all know about the Elland Road factor, which is huge.\n\n\"So, I think it's between Forest, Palace and West Ham. It is going to be so tight. I really think its going to go down to the wire.\"\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "description": "Newcastle boss Eddie Howe admitted he is \"not doing my job well enough\" after Saturday's defeat by Brentford - but is he under pressure?",
    "fullText": "The St James' Park crowd roared in belief.\n\nNewcastle United captain Bruno Guimaraes had just drawn his side level at 2-2 against Brentford with a confident penalty.\n\nBut the Magpies were not content with a late equaliser. Sandro Tonali picked the ball out of the net so the game could quickly restart as Guimaraes led the rest of his buoyant team-mates back into their own half.\n\nWas it going to be one of those nights on Tyneside?\n\nIt said it all that this fragile side were only level for a few short minutes before Dango Ouattara fired Brentford back in front after capitalising on poor defending.\n\nThe team's body blow was one which left home supporters stunned as Newcastle fell to a damaging 3-2 defeat.\n\nOne irate supporter even made his way towards the back of the dugout in the closing stages to urge head coach Eddie Howe to \"sort it out\" before loud boos rang out at full-time.\n\nNewcastle are now languishing in 12th place in the Premier League - and Howe cut a visibly downbeat figure after the match.\n\n\"I always feel under pressure,\" the Newcastle head coach said.\n\nOne win in eight games in all competitions is the current form.\n\n\"The type of pressure is irrelevant to me,\" Howe said.\n\n\"When you're in this job, you're always in that moment, whether it's pressure to win and keep winning or pressure to turn around results. We're very much in that feeling.\n\n\"I always say the pressure I put on myself couldn't be more extreme because I demand really high standards from what I'm doing, how I work, and what I ask the players to do. I'm obviously not doing my job well enough at the moment.\"\n\nHowe has endured sticky spells before, of course.\n\nThis is a man who took charge of a side in deep relegation trouble in 2021 and only won one of his opening 10 games in all competitions.\n\nThere was a humiliating FA Cup exit to Cambridge United along the way on an afternoon when Kieran Trippier made his debut for the club.\n\nNow, more than four years on, Trippier stressed he took \"full responsibility\" after being caught out in the build-up to all of Brentford's goals.\n\n\"It is nothing about the manager,\" Trippier told Sky Sports. \"We take responsibility for the performances.\n\n\"The manager puts the plan out and we try and execute it. I am not going down that route about the manager. I would never do that.\"\n\nBut these past few months have arguably been the most challenging of Howe's stint at the club - on and off the field - and the strain can be traced as far back to the summer.\n\nNewcastle operated without a sporting director and missed out on a number of first-choice targets, including Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and James Trafford, in a window when top scorer Alexander Isak went on strike in order to push through a move to Liverpool.\n\nHowe had a huge say on recruitment, but Newcastle ended up spending over £250m on Jacob Ramsey, Anthony Elanga, Malick Thiaw, Yoane Wissa and Nick Woltemade, as well as bringing in goalkeeper Aaron Ramsdale on loan.\n\nIt was rather telling that only two recruits - Thiaw and Wissa - started against Brentford.\n\nWissa had a poked effort cleared off the line, when his side were 1-0 up, but this was another goalless outing for the former Brentford forward.\n\nHe left the field to a humiliating chorus of \"what a waste of money\" from the away end after being substituted.\n\nWissa has scored just three goals since making his debut in December, while Woltemade has only found the back of the net on one occasion in that same period.\n\nOne man who certainly knew where the goal was Alan Shearer, the club's leading scorer.\n\nShearer recognised that things are not good enough, but insisted Howe was \"not under pressure\".\n\n\"The signings in the summer - apart from Malick Thiaw - have not been good enough and hit anything like top form,\" said Shearer, who is a pundit on Saturday's Match of the Day.\n\n\"They simply haven't justified the money that was spent on them as yet and that has hindered Howe.\n\n\"Like any manager, things need to get better and they need to turn a corner, but in terms of him losing his job? Absolutely not.\"\n\nSuch esteem should not come as a surprise.\n\nThis is a manager who ended Newcastle's seven-decade wait for a major domestic trophy less than a year ago, and who led his side to Champions League qualification in 2025 and 2023.\n\nIt is why Howe commanded instant respect from chief executive David Hopkinson and sporting director Ross Wilson when they were finally appointed earlier this season.\n\nThe pair have quickly struck up a relationship with Howe, and have repeatedly talked about the importance of alignment behind the scenes at a time when there have been very public ructions at clubs elsewhere.\n\nThere has been a degree of an understanding that this side are in transition following a turbulent summer.\n\nThere is also a recognition behind the scenes that the incredibly hands-on Howe has not had much training time with his players, and has had to contend with fatigue and injuries during a relentless schedule this season, which is a relatively new phenomenon for Newcastle.\n\nNewcastle have a strong chance of reaching the last 16 of the Champions League, and have an FA Cup fourth-round tie against Aston Villa to come next week, but this season is unravelling. Fast.\n\nNo teams have dropped more points from winning positions in the league than Newcastle (19).\n\nHowe's team have only won three away games in all competitions this season, and have lost three of their last four matches at St James' Park.\n\nThey are as close to the relegation zone as they are the top five.\n\nSuch statistics are all the more damning in a week during which Hopkinson doubled down on his assertion that Newcastle would be competing for the biggest prizes by 2030.\n\nHowe certainly needs no reminding that he needs to spark a turnaround sooner rather than later.\n\n\"I've got to work better, do more and take full responsibility for everything you see on the pitch,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got to work out solutions. That's for me to do and it's the same for the players.\n\n\"I have to ask them to be really honest with themselves and look at their best level and judge how we are playing against that now in this current moment.\n\n\"I don't think there's too many who could say they're playing towards their best so that gives us growth to improve.\"\n\nOuattara gives Brentford first win at Newcastle in 92 years\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Arguments for Gregor Townsend remaining as Scotland head coach are growing increasingly small after familiar failings lead to defeat in rainy Rome, writes Tom English.",
    "fullText": "When Scotland splished and splashed through the phases at the end of a dour but compelling battle in Rome, their moment of truth had arrived - the time to deliver on their spoken words about ruthlessness was upon them.\n\nThey worked it downfield, through the puddles, through and around the demonic Italian players, over halfway and into the enemy 22.\n\nThis was it? A romp in the swamp or failure in the foulness of a Rome afternoon?\n\nAfter 29 phases the answer came. Max Williamson held up, Italy ball, game over. Italy off to a flyer, Scotland left talking about disappointment. Again.\n\nGregor Townsend gave something of a party political broadcast on behalf of the positivity party in the aftermath, a promise of jam tomorrow after gruel today. Hard to stomach, that.\n\n\"It didn't happen,\" said the head coach. \"We're going to make sure it happens next week.\"\n\nWe've heard those words before, more than once. Promises from Townsend are a weakening currency.\n\nFighting talk from his players about the introspection sessions they have put themselves through since the implosions of the autumn were words that were not acted upon when the first test of their mettle arrived.\n\nThose last minutes were their opportunity to overcome the elements, defeat a team that deserved their lead and steal a game that would have tasted sweet. But they couldn't.\n\nThey didn't warrant a win. Italy opened up a lead in biblical conditions and did just about enough to keep it.\n\nTheir celebrations were joyous, befitting a team that showed incredible heart for the fight.\n\nThis is good for Six Nations rugby. Best whisper that out of the earshot of Scotland folk.\n\nInquest begins after Italy defeat\n\nI believe in what we're doing - Townsend\n\nItaly punish lacklustre Scotland in Rome rain\n\nFor Townsend's team, in far too many games, there's uncertainty about when the damage will be done - the start or the end - but there is a near certainty that at some point it will indeed be done. It's the rhythm of life under Townsend.\n\nIn Rome, it was at the start. There was talk from within the Scotland camp that they needed to execute better when entering an opponent's 22. There were good reasons for that chat.\n\nIn last season's Six Nations, they ranked second of six in terms of visits to a rival's 22 and yet sixth of six in terms of points gained from those visits. Profligacy, as well as mental fragility, was a work-on, as they say.\n\nA few minutes into the game, Scotland had an attacking line-out in Italy's 22. A time for deeds now, not words. Clinical rugby, remember. Lessons learned. Progress.\n\nTheir ball was stolen at the front and Italy escaped. It was the beginning of an utter calamity out of touch for Ewan Ashman, in particular, and his successor, George Turner.\n\nThe conditions? Yes, abject, but Scotland's error count across the board was higher than Italy's.\n\nAt times, when throws were pilfered or just launched over the back with no jumper and seemingly no communication, it was an unholy mess.\n\nYou wouldn't have predicted a Scotland defeat that early, but you get to understand the triggers in this team and the omens weren't encouraging.\n\nEspecially so within a few minutes because Italy scored. Winning the air, as they so often did, they showed the kind of precision that Scotland only talked about. Ignacio Brex grubbered for Louis Lynagh and Italy had landed the first blow.\n\nBecoming hard to score against was another of those non-negotiables that the Scotland boys mentioned. Up in smoke already.\n\nScotland had another attacking line-out inside Italy's 22 soon after. Stolen again. A dozen minutes had been played and now, truly, you were hearing the music from Jaws ringing in the ears.\n\nFor a time, the conditions looked like they were impacting just one team out there. Italy went to the air once more, Lynagh got the better of the targeted Jamie Dobie and the score was on.\n\nMichele Lamaro, the totem of the back-row, skipped a pass out to Tommaso Menoncello and a five-point lead became 12. A dozen points in that weather is worth a whole lot more.\n\nChasing in the rain makes you panic, makes you force things, eats into what is left of your belief.\n\nTo Scotland's credit - and there's very little to go around - they scored through Jack Dempsey and again, later on, through the effervescent George Horne.\n\nPaolo Garbisi's boot and the incredibly strong will of his team kept the Scots at bay.\n\nThat and the mistake mountains the visitors constantly constructed. It was a dogfight and Italy's dogs were just that bit more menacing.\n\nTownsend went 5-3 on his bench but in the rain, in hindsight, he needed to go 6-2.\n\nGet another beast in there instead of Adam Hastings who sat it all out. What was the point of picking him if you were not going to trust him? One question among many.\n\nThe line-out and the scrum went south. Ashman's foul play saw a Scotland penalty become an Italy penalty - and another three points. Finn Russell kicked out on the full. Turner saw yellow for a daft offence at the side of a ruck.\n\nScotland killed their own momentum. It was not the kind of ruthlessness they meant when talking about what they hoped to do in Rome.\n\nHope arrived with Horne and that piece of brilliance when finishing in the corner.\n\nThe scrum-half had not long come on to the pitch, winding up his team-mates as he did so. Somebody needed to fire them up because they looked flat, the body language betraying a team that was going under.\n\nThere was a glimmer of optimism but it petered out; death by phases in the end, 29 of them that went somewhere and then nowhere, a bit like Townsend's regime, you might say.\n\nThe players failed dismally but the reaction will be an evisceration of the coach. The buck stops there, of course.\n\nScotland didn't just start treading water when they ran out into Stadio Olimpico on Saturday, they've been doing it for too long now.\n\nTownsend has a contract until 2027 with, it seems, the promise of a gig with Newcastle once the World Cup is over. Maybe there's logic in expediting that.\n\nThe justifications for allowing Townsend remaining in place for another Six Nations and a World Cup after that have become pitifully small.\n\nUnless miracles start falling out of the sky the need to end this after this Six Nations is becoming greater and greater.\n\nTownsend is now playing a miserable game of catch-up, a grim pursuit of a few wins to take the dirty look off their campaign.\n\nEngland next at Murrayfield on Saturday. Good luck with that. Wales afterwards in Cardiff. A likely win, but you wouldn't bet a bob on it. Then, France, lethal, and Ireland, who will have some of their missing players, restored.\n\nOne win from five is the vista here. It's untenable if it pans out that way.\n\nUntenable if the Scottish Rugby Union decision-makers do their job. No promise of that. No promise of anything, especially Townsend's vow to make amends in the Calcutta Cup. The plaintive cry has become tiresome.",

While the stated criteria emphasized high-quality writing and nonpolitical content, more than $2 million in prize money largely flowed to users ranging from popular right-wing influencers to anonymous accounts whose content mirrored the policy positions and grievances Musk has amplified since acquiring the platform.\n\nThe $1 million grand prize went to X user @beaverd for an article titled “Deloitte, a $74 billion cancer metastasized across America,” which aggregated data about government contracts with the consulting giant. Deloitte contracts were targeted for cuts by the Department of Government Efficiency when Musk was leading the Trump administration initiative. DOGE terminated at least 127 Deloitte contracts, according to Business Insider.\n\nMusk personally engaged with the winner prior to the announcement, replying “Troubling” to the user’s article on Jan. 20.\n\nMusk had also responded to a post by @beaverd claiming fraud at Minneapolis day care centers, writing, “Wow.”\n\nThe user has a history of racist and fringe posts on X.\n\nIn one post, @beaverd wrote, “i think america is ready for a shade of white lets send those somali’s back.” In another, the user said, “we gave multi culturalism a good college try it doesnt work. no more white guilt.” In December, Musk made a post saying “No more white guilt” as well.\n\nIn a November 2024 exchange, @beaverd weighed in after another user commented on photos of then-President-elect Donald Trump meeting with President Joe Biden at the White House. “Weird that he looks so happy while hanging out with literally Hitler,” the other user commented, to which @beaverd replied: “God I wish he was literally Hitler.”\n\nThe @beaverd account did not respond to NBC News’ questions about the nature of previous posts or if the prize money had been received. X did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBeyond the grand prize winner, the slate of runners-up and honorable mentions suggests the rule against political posts was selectively enforced. Many of the winning articles mirrored specific right-wing policy positions or culture war topics that dominate the platform’s current ecosystem.\n\nOne of the honorable mention awards was given to internet personality Kaizen Asiedu for his article “White People Didn’t Invent Slavery. The West Ended It.” Musk had posted in support of the article on Jan. 24, prior to the winners being announced, writing, “True.”\n\nIn August 2025, Asiedu had posted a video with the caption, “White people didn’t invent slavery,” to which Musk replied, “This is historical fact.”\n\nAnother honorable mention went to content creator Nick Shirley, who went viral after making a video with claims of fraud at Somali-run day care centers in Minnesota. His article submission was titled “How I Exposed Fraud, ended Tim Walz and proved MSM is dead.” The Minnesota Department of Children, Youth, and Families previously told NBC News it had visited the nine facilities referenced in the video and found them “operating as expected.”\n\nMusk has posted several times about Shirley’s video and wrote in one response, “This is very common btw.” After being awarded $100,000, Shirley posted to thank Musk and X.\n\nThe pattern continued with the $500,000 “runner up” award, given to @KobeissiLetter for an article analyzing Trump’s tariff strategies. The user has had at least 11 public interactions with Musk dating back to 2023.\n\nVenture capitalist Josh Wolfe also won a $100,000 honorable mention award for the article “The Arctic Smokescreen,” which attempts to explain Trump’s Greenland acquisition strategy. Musk has supported Trump’s plans to acquire Greenland, writing in a post earlier this year, “The people of Greenland should decide their future and I think they want to be part of America!”\n\nWolfe has previously posted in support of Musk, responding to a video post by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., calling Musk “unintelligent.”\n\n“I’ve been critical of @elonmusk on tesla. I love Spacex, I like DOGE. I think AOC is a populist huckster grifter. Maybe she thinks attacking Elon will galvanize her base and help her raise money. I hope Elon gets her out of office,” Wolfe wrote in February 2025.\n\nTwo other winners, Ryan Hall and Dan Koe, were respectively awarded $100,000 and $250,000 for nonpolitical articles. Hall’s article focused on weather patterns while Koe provided advice on how to improve focus.\n\nThe competition won’t be the last time X will reward creators monetarily.\n\nOn Wednesday, the X Creators account announced a Super Bowl promotion to give away $1 million, $500,000 and $250,000 in cash prizes to three creators of video ads for Grok, xAI’s chatbot, made with the company’s video model. In January, the video generation tool attracted global criticism after an update allowed it to generate thousands of sexualized deepfakes of real people per hour, according to some counts.\n\nUsers have already generated ads for the contest containing racist slurs.\n\nThe winning videos will be will be “featured on X during Game Day.”\n\nBruna Horvath is an intern on NBC News' tech team.\n\nTavleen Tarrant is an associate social newsgathering reporter for NBC News",

    "description": "BBC health correspondent James Gallagher gets his blood analysed to understand how air pollution is killing us.",
    "fullText": "I'm in a laboratory staring at my blood under a microscope. Rather than pristine red blood cells, some of them have been tainted with black markings. I'm now one of the first people in the world to see air pollution building up inside their body.\n\nLess than an hour ago I was standing next to four lanes of busy central London traffic. It was the type of road where you can taste the air and you're left with a gritty sensation in your mouth.\n\nI had volunteered to stand there for 10 minutes; breathing in dirty air as part of an experiment to understand how air pollution is affecting our bodies and damaging our health.\n\nIn the UK, poor air quality is thought to kill 30,000 people a year, as well as harming babies in the womb and exacerbating conditions from asthma to dementia.\n\nMost of the air pollution I was breathing in came from traffic – billowing invisibly out of exhaust pipes, but also released by the wear and tear of tyres and brakes.\n\nProf Jonathan Grigg, from Queen Mary University of London, calls this spot his \"exposure chamber\".\n\nShouting over the blare of revving engines and sirens, he tells me most people incorrectly assume air pollution is all filtered out by our nose or mouth, or is trapped and then brought up out of the lungs.\n\n\"What we're looking at is whether the smallest particles are not only staying in your lung, but moving across into your bloodstream and going around your body,\" says Grigg.\n\nAfter our dose of London air, we head back to the laboratory where I have my finger pricked and a sample of blood prepared for examination.\n\nUnder the microscope, we can easily see the red disc-shaped cells that transport oxygen around our bodies.\n\nIt takes a few minutes for me to get my eyes in, but then the air pollution becomes apparent. It appears as tiny black dots stuck to the red blood cells.\n\nThese are pieces of carbon and other chemicals, like a miniature lump of coal, that come from the incomplete burning of fuel. They're known as PM 2.5, because the particles are smaller than 2.5 micrometres.\n\nI'm not surprised to see air pollution, it's why we're doing the experiment, but I can't escape a feeling of being dirtied, contaminated… sullied by it.\n\nResearcher Dr Norrice Liu has looked at more than a dozen volunteers' blood samples as part of a study.\n\nOn average, one in every two to three thousand red blood cells had picked up a hitch-hiking piece of pollution.\n\nThat might not sound like much, but scale it up to the full five litres of blood in an adult and the researchers estimate there could be 80 million red blood cells transporting pollution around our bodies.\n\n\"It's a bit upsetting to see that, isn't it?\" says Liu. \"Every time I walk by a busy road, now I'm thinking how much of this is travelling around my body… you just feel like you don't want to be out on the road much.\"\n\nI stood beside the road for just 10 minutes. It was busy, but it was not an extreme scenario. Your blood has probably looked like this too.\n\nThe team at Queen Mary University of London have shown that levels of air pollution in the blood come back down after about two hours of breathing clean air.\n\nGrigg was \"pretty shocked\" the air pollution was so visible in blood, but says the important question is where it's going.\n\nIt's not being breathed back out, he says, some may be filtered out by the kidneys and leave the body in urine. But the most likely answer is that particles of pollution are \"wiggling their way through the lining of the blood vessels and lodging in various organs\".\n\nThis research is starting to explain why air pollution has been linked to so many health problems far beyond the lungs, including in the brain and for babies still in the womb.\n\nDeposits of black carbon from air pollution have been found in the human body including in placentas analysed after birth.\n\n\"There's no reason why it's choosing one organ over another,\" says Liu, \"so chances are they're everywhere.\"\n\nAnd there are other forms of air pollution, such as nitrogen oxides, which are gases and are not visible down the microscope, but are known to cause harm.\n\nThe World Health Organization says 99% of the world population breathes in polluted air leading to seven million deaths a year. A report by the Royal College of Physicians estimates the figure for the UK is 30,000 deaths a year.\n\nSir Stephen Holgate, who led that report, said there was no doubt air pollution was damaging our health - \"it's nailed, it's game set and match\" - and the clearest evidence was coming from areas that were cutting air pollution and seeing the benefit.\n\nBut now that air pollution is \"largely invisible\", unlike the smogs of yesteryear, most of us don't realise we're breathing it in and \"don't really understand that air pollution on a daily basis is damaging\", he says.\n\nAir pollution has been linked to harms throughout our lives and throughout our bodies.\n\nThere are many ways dirty air can harm the other organs of our body, but triggering inflammation is thought to be the main one. Inflammation is our body's natural response to injury and infection, but can also affect blood vessels to make heart attacks and strokes more likely.\n\nInflammation in the lungs has been shown to wake up dormant cancerous cells, which then develop into deadly tumours. Around one in 10 lung cancers are thought to be caused by air pollution in the UK.\n\nEven while in the womb, air pollution is even thought to alter how a developing baby's DNA is functioning during critical stages of development.\n\n\"There's a very sensitive period when air pollution can cause a problem and it undoubtedly does: small lungs, small heart and some problems with brain development,\" says Sir Stephen.\n\nAt the other end of life, components of air pollution seem to be \"accelerating the process\" of dementia, he says, by helping plaques of toxic proteins form inside the brain.\n\nThere is advice on how to minimise our exposure to air pollution - including walking on quieter side streets or keeping away from the edge of the road so you're further from traffic. This is especially important for babies in buggies, who are much closer to the height of exhaust pipes.\n\nGrigg's study showed a tight-fitting FFP2 mask led to less air pollution in the blood, but \"we're not saying that everyone should wear a mask\", says Grigg, adding some clinically vulnerable people including those \"recovering from a heart attack or have chronic respiratory disease\" might benefit while in areas of high pollution.\n\nBut the tricky thing with air pollution is you're often breathing in the pollution caused by other people. It is not easy to just live somewhere else if your house is on a busy road.\n\nChanges to cars – not just sales of electric vehicles, but emissions standards on newer diesel and petrol engines – are improving air quality.\n\nBut Grigg says: \"I think the more we understand the mechanisms of how it can cause these effects, the more we can add to the pressure for policy makers to reduce exposure - because that's the answer in the end.\"\n\nInside Health was produced by Tom Bonnett",

    "title": "Font Rendering from First Principles",
    "description": "Learn what it takes to build a font renderer from scratch in C.",
    "fullText": "Font rendering is a technology that often gets taken for granted -- it's hard to imagine interacting with computers without it. But how hard could it really be? Turns out, way harder than you might think:\n\nLooking at FreeType (GPL-licensed, used in e.g. Chromium, GNU/Linux, etc.), they claim to be >200k LOC.\n\nI decided to roll my own. In this article, I provides a high level walkthrough of the TTF file spec and my implementation. But first, why not just use FreeType, or some other equivalent? What's the benefit of going through it yourself?\n\nBefore we can start rendering strings, we first need to read the font data in. I focused on TTF (TrueType) file format for my implementation. The other generally used format, OTF (OpenType), can be considered a superset of TTF (also including PostScript fonts), so if you wanted to render OTF fonts, you'd have to make a TTF parser anyway. There are plenty of fonts expressed using TTF over OTF, certainly enough to cover my initial use case (latin alphanumeric glyphs), so I doubt I'm going to extend the implementation to OTF any time soon.\n\nAt a high level, TTF files provide some mapping between character codepoints to glyph information.\n\nA character's \"codepoint\" refers to its unicode encoding format. You may be familiar with ASCII encoding, which is a 1-byte wide representation of each character in the latin alphabet (for example, the character 'A' maps to 65, 'z' maps to 122, etc.). A major limiting factor with ASCII is it doesn't provide nearly enough space to describe non-latin languages as well. Unicode is an internationally adopted solution to this problem. Unicode has various encoding formats, for example UTF-8 and UTF-32; their only difference is how they encode this codepoint (UTF-32 always represents codepoints using 4 bytes, UTF-8 uses a variable length). Conveniently, UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII (thanks, Ken Thompson & Rob Pike). Since I'm only focusing on the latin alphabet for now, this means the codepoint for 'a' can be retrieved via (uint8_t) ('a'). Read more about the Unicode standard here.\n\nGlyphs are just an abstraction over letters and characters. TTF files have no notion of what the letter 'a' is, rather it's an opaque mapping of some value (unicode codepoint) to some data about that value (glyph). This includes the literal points and curves associated with that line, so that we can draw it, as well as additional metrics about that character that we need to be careful to consider -- the latin alphabet highlights why these metrics are important, look at this image as an example:\n\nHere, the same string is rendered twice (below: the readable string, above: each glyph's texture is fully opaque). Observe the differences between glyphs -- how the center sits in relation to the baseline, how much space is added between characters, all of this is highly dependent on which font and which characters you're trying to render. To learn more, I would recommend taking a look at the FreeType documentation.\n\nGetting back to TTF files, you can find the reference manual here. You'll quickly notice that the overarching file format itself isn't too terribly complicated; there are a number of tables that contain different pieces of information on the individual glyphs that make up the font as a whole. Only a handful of tables are immediately relevant:\n\nFrom this, we can start to paint a picture on how we should get to our font shape information. For each character we want to render:\n\nThere are a few other tables that have some useful information worth noting:\n\nThere are certainly other tables for you to inspect as is relevant to your use case (e.g. vhea and vmtx exist for vertical languages). A major part of the TTF file spec is specifying instructions for scaling the font to specific resolutions -- this becomes more important if you're planning on only supporting bitmap rendering at smaller scales. I've found that alternative approaches, namely SDF-based rendering, achieve high quality results without having to muck about with this part of the spec, so I've ignored these tables.\n\nOne of the main challenges at this step is validating the data you're reading in from the TTF file data, since we're reading from an opaque binary blob (which, at least I'm not super used to). Running a debugger is your friend here. I'd also suggest becoming familiar with and comparing your results against another known-good TTF parser for comparison when times get tough, I used stb_truetype for this purpose.\n\nGreat, now we know where our glyph data lives, it's time to parse it. Follow along in the reference manual: here.\n\nTTF glyphs are comprised of a series of contours, which themselves are described as a series of quadratic Bezier curves. These are comprised of 3 points: a start point, an end point, and a \"control\" point. Bezier curves are formally defined as a \"linear combination\" of these points (start -> control -> end), where, given t in range [0, 1], calculate the linear interpolation between point pairs, recursively, until you collapse to a single point. For example, for a given t = 0.4, we place an intermediary point 40% of the way between the start and control point, and 40% of the way between the control point and the end point, then repeat, placing our final, on-curve point 40% of the way between our intermediary points. This is repeated for all t values between 0 and 1 to create the final curve. This is probably easier to understand visualized:\n\nAnother way to describe quadratic Bezier curves is by the formula: (((1-t)^2) * P_start) + (2(1 - t)t * P_control) + ((t^2) * P_end), where, again t is in the range [0, 1] (this isn't so bad once you realize this is just a regular quadratic under the hood).\n\nMoving back up the chain, these curves are combined to form contours, which are combined to form the overall glyph shape. As an example, here are the contours describing the glyph 'B' in the Consola font, where each contour is a separate color (note that Bezier control points are colored in purple):\n\nWe see that, in this case, there are 3 separate contours: one for the \"outer shell\", and two for the \"holes\" to cut out of it. The TTF spec requires that these classes of contours be defined separately -- the ordering of \"shell\" contour points must be clockwise, and \"hole\" contour points must be counter-clockwise. We will use this information later when rasterizing the glyph to know when we are entering or exiting the shape, so it's good to note here.\n\nTTF stores the quadratic Bezier points in a set of contiguous arrays, that, once parsed, collapse to a pretty simple struct:\n\nNext, we need to unravel a bit of compression TTF applies to our point data. Sometimes, it omits points from the stream -- we have to add them back in. Consider that the expected stream of points would look something like: point (on-curve) -> point (off-curve) -> point (on-curve) -> repeat. Looking at the data stream we are actually provided, we often encounter situations like point (off-curve) -> point (off-curve) -- what do we do here?. In these scenarios, an on-curve point is implied to be at the midpoint of these off-curve points, and we need to add it in ourselves. Additionally, the spec is happy to give you cases like point (on-curve) -> point (on-curve) -- there aren't any tricks here, this is just a straight line between these two points, it's just another case to be on the lookout for that's separate from the quadratic Bezier case.\n\nThe way I chose to model this is by describing the curve as follows:\n\nWhere the end of the bezier curve is implied to be the start point of the next bezier curve in the contour. I chose to force line-cases into this model by inserting an unnecessary control point at the midpoint to simplify processing later down the line, you can certainly choose to break these cases apart and handle them separately.\n\nThe file spec also describes \"compound glyphs\" -- this is essentially another form of compression. Some characters contain sub-glyphs that are commonly used throughout a given font (think the dot over 'i' and 'j', or diacritics over characters like é) -- rather than copying the countour data several times to cover all of the characters, TTF instead defines them in as separate glyphs, and instructs you to merge them using a set of transformations as relevant for the target character. The exact transformation calculations are described in more detail in the spec, but the hard part of actually retrieving the contour shapes themselves is reused as described above.\n\nWith shapes in hand, it's time to get rasterizing. The algorithm is loosely as follows:\n\nIdentify a target portion of a bitmap we want to rasterize to.\n\nYou could generate separate bitmaps for each character, but it's likely may more efficient / optimal to generate an atlas comprising all of your characters, and index into that when issuing draw calls to the GPU later down the line. This is what I did. Therefore, we need to determine which sub-section of the atlas to render the character bitmap to.\n\nFor each row (y-value) in the target bitmap, determine the corresponding y-value in glyph space.\n\nThis can be done by a simple linear mapping between the two spaces. E.g. we know the height of our target bitmap and the height of the glyph, so, given some y value in target bitmap space, the corresponding y in glyph space can be found by using proportions (y / target_height = ??? / glyph height). One thing to pay attention to here is we want to measure from the middle of the pixel, not the top or bottom.\n\nDetermine the x-intersections in the contour for our y-value in glyph space.\n\nThis can be done by solving for t in the quadratic Bezier formula -- in cases where 0 <= t <= 1, we have an intersection (since the curves are chained together, I only checked for intersections 0 <= t < 1, as Bezier_n(1) == Bezier_n+1(0)). BEWARE! that solving the quadratic involves dividing by some variable value, which can be 0 -- these cases describe Bezier curves that are secretly lines. For these cases, you should instead check for a linear intersection instead. My earlier decision to force lines into a quadratic Bezier representation works nicely here, because we have to implement this check anyway.\n\nFor each intersection, determine if it's \"entering\" or \"leaving\" the shape.\n\nE.g. consider a ray shooting across horizontally at the hole in the letter 'A' -- there are four separate intersection points along this line. We need to determine which sets of intersections constitue \"in\" and \"out\" of the shape. It's reasonable to think that we should always have an even number of intersections for a given line; for every entrance there must be an exit. However, in reality, due to floating point precision errors (and other eldritch magic), this may not always be the case.\n\nThis can be handled by taking advantage of how contours are described in the TTF spec. As described previously, \"shells\" must be defined clockwise, and \"holes\" must be defined counter-clockwise. Therefore, by looking at the derivative of Bezier curves we intersect with, we can determine whether we are entering (y-value increasing) or leaving (y-value decreasing) the shape. The Apple spec recommends accumulating a running winding count as we encounter intersection points -- this is implemented by +/- 1 for each intersection we encounter depending on whether we are entering or leaving the shape. When the winding order is > 0, the pen should be down and we should be drawing. Otherwise, the pen should be up.\n\nConvert the intersections to target bitmap space, and rasterize.\n\nNow that we have all the information we need, we can index into our target bitmap and color it in depending on whether each x-value is in or out of the shape.\n\nGreat, we're done! What do the results look like?\n\nPretty bad... Why? From what I can tell, this happens for a couple of reasons.\n\nThe lack of anti-aliasing (although, enabling linear sampling doesn't save it...).\n\nTTF fonts have additional instructions for how to render bitmaps at various sizes that we're willfully ignoring right now.\n\nBitmap fonts don't scale very well.\n\nIdeally, we want our bitmap atlases to be of a relatively small point size, to save on memory space. However, from my experience, we only really achieve decent-looking results when the font size is relatively high (the example here is rendered to a size of 32 pixels, and still looks bad).\n\nThere are a number of options we can do to correct our suboptimal font rasters (MSDF was another option I considered, you could also look at sub-pixel rendering). I chose to go with generating an SDF for the glyph, which was attractive, as it's fairly straightforward to add on as an additional step to what has already been implemented here (e.g. for bitmap rasterization). Furthermore, SDF fonts scale very well to arbitrary resolutions, which is a reasonable constraint e.g. when rendering signs, etc. in 3D environments (e.g. games where the player may walk arbitrarily close to the font being rendered). I've also found that SDF fonts look reasonable in 2D scenarios as well (e.g. for UIs, menus, etc.).\n\nBut first, what even is an SDF? How will it fix our problem here?\n\nSDF stands for \"signed distance field\". SDFs can be described as a functional representation of an arbitrary shape that determines the distance to the edge of that shape (\"signed\" comes from this value being negative inside the shape, positive outside the shape). As relevant for font rendering, instead of computing a binary \"is this in or out\" decision for every pixel in our target bitmap, we determine the distance from that pixel to the closest point of the opposite state (drawn or not-drawn). This provides a smooth gradient along the edge of the shape of \"in-ness\" that we can leverage along with the GPU's ability to quickly and efficiently interpolate between values at scale to render font characters at a higher range of resolutions compared to raw bitmap representations. To learn more about SDFs (and how they can be more generally applied to 2/3D shapes), this article by Xor is a good starting point.\n\nHere's an SDF for the letter 'B'. Notice how there is a gradient around the letter as we extend further beyond the hard edge for the letter -- we can use this to anti-alias the raw bitmap.\n\nTo generate the SDF of a given glyph, as per this Valve paper on the subject:\n\nGenerate the bitmap of the glyph.\n\nThis reuses what we implemented before entirely.\n\nFrom my experience, rasterizing a comparatively large bitmap is important here, to provide a high level of granularity to the later steps. Essentially, the higher the resolution, the more accurate the distance measurement is later, leading to higher quality results. Since the bitmap raster is not maintained after the SDF is generated, we don't need to pay that high of a memory cost to hold the high-resolution bitmap raster over a longer period of time. I default to a bitmap font height of 64 here.\n\nSimilarly to bitmap rasterization, we need to determine where in a target bitmap to place the SDF raster.\n\nFor each pixel in the SDF target bitmap, we need to determine which pixel is closest in the raw bitmap. This is similar, but slightly different from generating the raw bitmap -- in that case, we only needed to map target bitmap y-values (here, we do it for every pixel).\n\nFor every pixel in the target SDF bitmap, determine the closest distance to a pixel of the opposite state in the raw glyph bitmap.\n\nThis can be done by choosing some \"spread factor\" (kernel size) and searching in a square of that size around the target pixel. This parameter is tune-able, I've found a value of 4 is reasonable here. In cases where no on pixel is found, use the maximum distance possible for the given kernel size.\n\nMap the distance to a byte range [0, 255] and save that to the SDF atlas.\n\nA caveat here is that the produced SDF bitmaps here aren't meant for rendering by themselves -- these are better described as a cache of SDF function values for each candidate glyph. So, we need additional instructions for how to convert these distance values into an actual bitmap we can draw to the screen. I produced a shader (OpenGL) for this purpose. Of more interest is the fragment shader:\n\nYou'll see that we extract the cached distance value for each given pixel we're rendering, applying some smoothstep over it to determine the alpha, using the result in the final pixel color. Put simply, this determines at what distance along the field of \"in-ness\" around the SDF do we actually consider in and out of that character. This is controlled by 2 parameters, threshold, which is the cut of in / out, and smoothing, which applies some gradual transition / blurring over the threshold value.\n\nSo, what do these results look like?\n\nMuch better here. What does this look like side by side with the raw bitmap? Are there still deficiencies in SDF rasters?\n\nThis is using a bitmap height of 100 and SDF height of 32 (scaled to various render heights). You can see that, by and large, SDF looks better than raw bitmap across the board. But, we start to see some undesirable artifacting appear at larger font sizes. This can be corrected by rendering the SDF atlas at a higher resolution, but that comes with a higher memory cost associated, so pick your poison.\n\nIn the end, the results don't look too bad. Here's an example where I'm using this technique to render some UI widgets:\n\nMy implementation can be found in full here.\n\nIf you're looking for more resources on learning how to roll your own font rendering, I recommend the following:",

    "fullText": "When you use an AI service, you’re handing over your thoughts in plaintext. The operator stores them, trains on them, and–inevitably–will monetize them. You get a response; they get everything.\n\nConfer works differently. In the previous post, we described how Confer encrypts your chat history with keys that never leave your devices. The remaining piece to consider is inference—the moment your prompt reaches an LLM and a response comes back.\n\nTraditionally, end-to-end encryption works when the endpoints are devices under the control of a conversation’s participants. However, AI inference requires a server with GPUs to be an endpoint in the conversation. Someone has to run that server, but we want to prevent the people who are running it (us) from seeing prompts or the responses.\n\nThis is the domain of confidential computing. Confidential computing uses hardware-enforced isolation to run code in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). The host machine provides CPU, memory, and power, but cannot access the TEE’s memory or execution state.\n\nLLMs are fundamentally stateless—input in, output out—which makes them ideal for this environment. For Confer, we run inference inside a confidential VM. Your prompts are encrypted from your device directly into the TEE using Noise Pipes, processed there, and responses are encrypted back. The host never sees plaintext.\n\nBut this raises an obvious concern: even if we have encrypted pipes in and out of an encrypted environment, it really matters what is running inside that environment. The client needs assurance that the code running is actually doing what it claims.\n\nConfidential computing solves this with remote attestation. When a confidential VM boots, the hardware generates a signed quote—a cryptographic statement containing hashes of the kernel, initrd, and command line. These hashes are called measurements, and they uniquely identify the code running inside the TEE.\n\nFor Confer, we extend the measurement to cover the entire root filesystem using dm-verity. This builds a merkle tree over every byte of the filesystem and embeds the merkle root hash in the kernel command line. Since the command line is measured, any change to any file changes the attestation. The measurement now covers everything.\n\nBut a measurement is just a hash. To verify it, someone needs to be able to reproduce it.\n\nThe Confer proxy and image are built with nix and mkosi to produce bit-for-bit reproducible outputs. Anyone can clone the repository, run the build, and get the exact same measurements.\n\nEach release is also signed and published to a transparency log that is easily searchable. The log is append-only and publicly auditable, which means we can’t quietly publish a different build for different users.\n\nNow we have an intuition for how these parts can come together.\n\nWhen you open Confer and start a conversation, your client initiates a Noise handshake with the inference endpoint. The TEE responds with its attestation quote embedded in the noise handshake.\n\nYour client verifies the quote’s signature, confirming it came from genuine TEE hardware. It checks that the public key in the quote matches the one used in the handshake–this binds the encrypted channel to the TEE, preventing interception or replay by anything outside it. It extracts the measurements and confirms they match a release in the transparency log.\n\nOnce verification succeeds, the handshake completes. Your client now has cryptographic assurance that it’s talking directly to verified code running in hardware-enforced isolation.\n\nAll traffic to the inference endpoint is then encrypted with ephemeral session keys that provide forward secrecy: even if a long-term key were later compromised, past conversations remain protected because the ephemeral keys no longer exist.\n\nConfer combines confidential computing with passkey-derived encryption to ensure your data remains private.\n\nThis is different from traditional AI services, where your prompts are transmitted in plaintext to an operator who stores them in plaintext (where they are vulnerable to hackers, employees, subpoenas), mines them for behavioral data, and trains on them.\n\nWe think Confer is how AI should work.\n\nDon't have Confer? Give it a try!",

    "fullText": "In a new study, researchers say that non-biological sources they considered could not fully account for the abundance of organic compounds in a sample collected on Mars by NASA’s Curiosity rover.\n\nIn March 2025, scientists reported identifying small amounts of decane, undecane, and dodecane in a rock sample analyzed in the chemistry lab aboard Curiosity. These were the largest organic compounds found on Mars, with researchers hypothesizing that they could be fragments of fatty acids preserved in the ancient mudstone in Gale Crater. On Earth, fatty acids are produced mostly by life, though they can be made through geologic processes, too.\n\nIt was not possible to determine from Curiosity’s data alone whether or not the molecules they found were made by living things, which led to a follow-on study that evaluated known non-biological sources of these organic molecules — such as delivery by meteorites smashing into the Martian surface — to see if they could account for the amounts previously found.\n\nReporting on Feb. 4 in the journal Astrobiology, researchers say that as the non-biological sources they considered could not fully explain the abundance of organic compounds, it is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that living things could have formed them.\n\nTo reach their conclusion, scientists combined lab radiation experiments, mathematical modeling, and Curiosity data to “rewind the clock” about 80 million years — the length of time the rock would have been exposed on the Martian surface. This allowed them to estimate how much organic material would have been present before being destroyed by long-term exposure to cosmic radiation: far more than typical non-biological processes could produce.\n\nThe team says more study is needed to better understand how quickly organic molecules break down in Mars-like rock under Mars-like conditions — and before any conclusions can be reached about the absence or presence of life.\n\nNASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (PIX11) — A New Jersey mother is sharing her daughter’s story in hopes of changing how high-caffeine drinks are labeled across the country, and the effort is now reaching Capitol Hill.\n\n“That was the day when my life changed forever,” Jill Katz said. It’s been years since her daughter Sarah died. In 2022, the 21-year-old college student went into cardiac arrest while out with friends. Her mother says it all started with a cup of lemonade, packed with caffeine.\n“She was at a friend’s birthday party, in college, and she collapsed. She didn’t make it,” Katz said. “It’s the call that keeps parents awake at night.”\n\nSarah had a heart condition, and her family says she had always been mindful about what she ate and drank. According to her mother, she didn’t realize that 30 ounces of the drink she ordered at a popular restaurant chain contained as much as 390 milligrams of caffeine.\n\nFor context, the FDA says most healthy adults should consume no more than 400 milligrams of caffeine per day, so the drink Sarah had was close to that limit in a single serving. “With grief, there is no restoration, but transformation,” Katz said. “Being involved with her legacy and being able to save other people’s lives in her memory.”\n\nMore: Latest News from Around the Tri-State\n\nThe restaurant chain has since removed the item from its menu following multiple lawsuits.\n\nCaffeine is widely used to boost energy by stimulating metabolism and making the heartbeat faster. Doctors, however, say high doses can be risky, especially for people with underlying conditions.\n\nAccording to the Caffeine Informer database, a single shot of espresso contains about 77 milligrams of caffeine. Energy drinks can range from 80 to 300 milligrams, depending on the brand and size. “When you stimulate so much, and the heart is not prepared for that, they can just collapse,” said cardiologist Dr. Daniel Garcia.\n\nGarcia says the lack of consistent labeling and regulation around caffeine can be dangerous for everyone, from college students to older adults. “As a cardiologist, I advise completely against any energy drink or high-content caffeine drink,” he said. “You don’t know exactly what the amount is and how your body is going to respond.”\n\nNow, Sarah’s death is drawing attention from lawmakers.\n\nNew Jersey Congressman Rob Menendez is pushing for the Sarah Katz Caffeine Safety Act, federal legislation that would require clearer warnings about caffeine in foods and beverages.\n\nRequire companies to clearly list caffeine content on bottles, cans, and packaging.\n\nRequire chain restaurants to disclose caffeine levels on menus.\n\nFlag items with 150 milligrams or more of caffeine with a visible “high caffeine” warning.\n\nAdd advisory language about recommended daily caffeine limits.\n\nOrder federal health agencies to study caffeine’s health effects and launch public education campaigns.\n\nSupporters say the goal is not to ban caffeinated drinks, but to make sure consumers know what they’re getting before they take a sip. “People need to know what they’re putting in their bodies,” Katz said. “We’re not talking about limiting or banning. We’re talking about making an informed choice.”\n\nThe bill has bipartisan support in Congress, with a total of 14 cosponsors, both Republicans and Democrats.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Singapore (AP) — This week’s Singapore Air Show brought together trade delegations from around the world to show off the latest in civilian and military aviation technology.\n\nThe event this year marked the 10th edition of the air show, which showcased cutting-edge planes from the Royal Australian Air Force and the United States Air Force. This included the F-35 Lightning II, the latest U.S.-made fifth-generation fighter jet that has integrated stealth technology and is considered one of the world’s most advanced combat aircraft.\n\nMajor commercial plane makers also touted the latest advancements in their fleets, including Airbus, Bombardier, Gulfstream, Boeing and China’s Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, known as COMAC.\n\n“We have a very good representation of the latest and the greatest,” said Leck Chet Lam, managing director of Experia Events, which organizes the event. “The Singapore Air Show, the unique part of it is we cover both the aviation and also the defense industries.”\n\nDuring the Singapore Air Show's aerial displays, COMAC promoted its C919 passenger jet, which China is pushing as an alternative to the European Airbus A320neo and the American Boeing 737 MAX. The daily aerial displays at the event also showcased six military teams and Airbus’ A350-1000.\n\nWithin the exhibition hall, the air show featured experimental air taxis, advanced flight simulators, a wide variety of drones and both manned and unmanned helicopters. The static aircraft display under Singapore’s sizzling sun included roughly 35 planes from more than 10 countries.\n\nIn all, more than 1,000 companies from around 50 countries participated in the air show, hosted on the grounds of Changi International Airport, Southeast Asia's busiest airport. The event, which opened on Feb. 3, is considered Asia’s largest aerospace and defense exhibition and runs through Feb. 8.\n\n“All the exhibitors can use Singapore as a springboard to then tap into the opportunities that are rising in the Asia-Pacific market, which is a key driver that is driving the growth of the global aviation industry,\" Lam said.\n\nThis is a photo gallery curated by AP photo editors.",

    "description": "The billionaire former \"Shark Tank\" star and Dallas Mavericks owner is a dedicated AI user.",
    "fullText": "Mark Cuban said artificial intelligence is only in its early stages and has the potential to create massive wealth—possibly even the world’s first trillionaire. He uses AI extensively in his personal life and sees it as a powerful tool for improving productivity and creativity. Still, he acknowledged the risks and limitations of AI.\n\nSome of the world’s largest and most successful tech companies were built at home: Steve Jobs founded Apple in the garage of his parents’ home, and Jeff Bezos also founded Amazon in his garage.\n\nAnd thanks to artificial intelligence, the trend of developing blockbuster companies at home is sure to continue. Mark Cuban, the billionaire former principal owner of the Dallas Mavericks and Shark Tank star, recently said AI could help make the world’s first trillionaire.\n\n“We haven’t seen the best or the craziest of what [AI is] going to be able to do,” Cuban told the High Performance podcast in an episode published last summer. “And not only do I think it’ll create a trillionaire, but it could be just one dude in the basement. That’s how crazy it could be.”\n\nTake OpenAI, for example, which was formed in cofounder and president Greg Brockman’s living room in 2015. OpenAI is reportedly vying for an $800 billion valuation as it pursues more funding. Sam Altman, the CEO of OpenAI, is worth about $2 billion.\n\nWhile that’s a far cry from AI creating the world’s first trillionaire, a September 2024 report by wealth-tracking service Informa Connect said Tesla CEO Elon Musk is on pace to become a trillionaire by 2027.\n\n“There’s always something bigger and better that’s created by an innovative entrepreneur,” Cuban said. “But AI just dwarfs all that.”\n\nCuban appears to firmly believe in the power of AI, and said we’re only in the “preseason” of what the technology can really do.\n\n“As it becomes more advanced—and I’m not saying we’re going to get the Terminator—I’m not saying all of a sudden there’s going to be robots that are smarter than people, like the movie,” he told High Performance. “But we’ll find ways to make our lives better, more interesting, to work better, more effectively.”\n\nCuban also said he uses AI for nearly everything. He gave an example of how he uses it to track health metrics since he suffers from atrial fibrillation (“A-fib”).\n\nHe had to track when he was taking medications and working out, and used ChatGPT to help him record it. He also asked ChatGPT to let him know if there’s something he writes down that doesn’t seem right or that he should be concerned about.",

During the National Governors Association meeting later this month, President Donald Trump, 79, will only convene with Republican governors, state leaders learned on Friday. The move breaks from decades of meetings between the president and governors across the aisle. It also undermines the NGA’s stated goal of bipartisanship. The NGA meeting is scheduled for the weekend of Feb. 19 in Washington, D.C. The change in invite list comes after a series of public sparring matches with Democratic governors, including California’s Gavin Newsom and Minnesota’s Tim Walz.",

    "fullText": "Despite bringing in a $156,000 annual salary, a Chicago family is struggling to afford groceries, something the wife attributes to her husband’s growing $700-a-month addiction to tobacco and marijuana.\n\n“My husband is an addict,” Megan said during an episode of “The Ramsey Show” last year. She is a stay-at-home mother pregnant with their third child and called for advice from personal finance experts Dave Ramsey and Jade Warshaw. Megan said her husband typically spends around $6,000 a year on the habit, but the past couple of months have been worse due to the deaths of his father and grandfather.\n\nThe AI Marketing Platform Backed by Insiders from Google, Meta, and Amazon — Invest at $0.85/Share\n\nAmericans With a Financial Plan Can 4X Their Wealth — Get Your Personalized Plan from a CFP Pro\n\nBecause of her husband’s “erratic behavior,” Megan told the hosts she’s hesitant to pay off their $20,000 car loan even though they have the money. She fears that the freed-up $600 monthly payment would just vanish into his habit.\n\nRamsey immediately challenged the framing. “If I was to say that my wife was an addict, that would mean that our marriage was either getting ready to end or she was getting help next week,” he said. “But you use this like it’s part of the budget. If you’re going to call him an addict, you’re going to have to act like it.”\n\nHe added that if her concern is simply that her husband occasionally uses substances and it’s costing them $500 to $700 a month, that's a very different scenario than describing him as an addict.\n\nTrending: Designed for investors with strong market convictions, REX Shares builds ETFs for income, leverage, and tactical positioning — explore the lineup.\n\nWhen they asked about his income structure, Megan revealed she brings in no income currently. Her husband earns the entire household income. They take home about $7,800 per month after taxes, yet Megan said food insecurity remains a problem.\n\nWith a $3,400 mortgage, a $600 car payment, and significant deductions from his paycheck for things like a 401(k), the couple may be cash-strapped due to poor planning, not just his vices.\n\n“You’re making $8,000 a month take-home pay and you have a $3,000 house payment. You are not out of food because he spent 750 bucks,” Ramsey said. “You are going to be out of food if he loses his job because he stays drunk all the time.”\n\nSee Also: Put professional stock research to work in a single ETF — explore Motley Fool Asset Management's factor-based funds.",

    "fullText": "A coffee shop in Garden Grove is serving up more than just lattes.\n\nDD Café is licensed only as a coffee shop but is operating as a strip club.\n\nOn Thursday, police said 17 people were arrested at the café, but didn't give details on their charges or identities.\n\nGARDEN GROVE, Calif. - Inside DD Café in Garden Grove, the women are serving a lot more than coffee. FOX 11's undercover cameras captured female servers providing lap dances, offering private dances for cash, and telling customers they could bring alcohol inside for a fee.\n\nCity records show DD Café, located at 10552 McFadden Ave., is licensed only as a coffee shop.\n\nMytchell Mora, a former Garden Grove resident and news producer, says he raised concerns about the business multiple times over the past year, contacting the city, a nearby high school, and the school district.\n\n\"Everyone knows about it, and no one was doing anything about it,\" Mora said.\n\nMora says he is troubled by how close the business is to La Quinta High School, which is within walking distance of the café. Under the Garden Grove Municipal Code, adult entertainment businesses are prohibited within 1,000 feet of a school facility.\n\nFOX 11 visited DD Café to ask the owner about the type of business being operated. A woman inside who said she was in charge, told us the location was \"only a coffee shop,\" then asked us to leave. The owner was not available for comment.\n\nWe also reached out to the City of Garden Grove, emailing officials on Tuesday, February 3, and again on Thursday, February 5, describing the undercover footage and requesting comment. No response was received.\n\nLater that same Thursday night, the Garden Grove Police Department announced on social media that 17 people were arrested at DD Café. The business was also red-tagged, effectively ordering it closed. When asked what the red tag meant, someone in the police department told us it can be issued for a variety of reasons, including safety or code-related concerns.\n\nPolice have not released details about what the 17 individuals were arrested for, and it remains unclear what charges, if any, may be filed.\n\nResidents in the area told us they were not surprised, saying similar businesses are an open secret in the city and that more enforcement is needed.\n\nFOX 11 has requested additional information from the city and police department and will update this story as more details become available.\n\nInformation for this story came from undercover reporting by FOX 11. Interviews were also done with local residents. Information on the arrests came from the Garden Grove Police Department.",

    "fullText": "Lord Mandelson is reported to have received a five-figure taxpayer-funded payoff after he was sacked as US ambassador.\n\nThe 72-year-old is understood to have been awarded an exit payment of between £38,750 and £55,000 – the equivalent to three months’ salary from the Foreign Office – although he was axed last September, according to The Sunday Times.\n\nHe had held the role, which has the highest pay band, SCS4, in the diplomatic service of between £155,000 and £220,000 per annum, for seven months.\n\nPressure is growing on Sir Keir Starmer around his decision to appoint Lord Mandelson, although the latter’s friendship to the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein was well known.\n\nSir Keir claimed Lord Mandelson misled him about the depth of their friendship after Epstein’s 2008 conviction for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nA Foreign Office spokesman said: “Peter Mandelson’s civil service employment was terminated in September 2025 in accordance with legal ad­vice and the terms and conditions of his employment.\n\n“As we have consistently said to Parliament, normal civil service HR processes were followed.\n\n“Further information will be provided to Parliament as part of the Government response to the motion passed last week which is being co-ordinated by the Cabinet Office.\n\n“A review has been instigated in light of further information that has now been revealed and the ongoing police investigation.”\n\nIt is claimed Lord Mandelson had requested a higher payout following his sacking by Sir Olly Robbins, the Foreign Office’s permanent under-secretary.\n\nFollowing the decision, negotiations were held over the payoff between the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office’s human resources department and Lord Mandelson’s lawyers.\n\nA No 10 source told the Press Association: “Given what we know now, Mandelson should either pay the money back or give it to a charity to support victims.”\n\nEarlier this week, Wes Streeting, Health Secretary, a potential successor to Sir Keir but someone who was friendly with Lord Mandelson before his downfall, said the peer should “certainly” hand back the money.\n\nIt is understood the payout was in line with the standard contractual arrangements for civil servants in the department.\n\nLord Mandelson has been approached by The Telegraph for comment via his lawyers.\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "fullText": "Today co-anchor Savannah Guthrie's mom, Nancy Guthrie's neighbor spotted a key detail in aerial footage that prompted police to search the 84-year-old's roof—where they found new evidence, a camera, as Nancy remains missing.\n\n🎬 \nNancy's neighbor, Laura Gargano, told CNN that she notified police to check to see if Savannah's mom had her roof recoated, as it could lead to tips. Gargano said she noticed how clean Nancy's roof looked in aerial footage of the home.\n\n\"You see in that image, you see how white her roof is,\" the neighbor told CNN. \"The previous three weeks we had a lot of rain, so it would be normal for a roof to a be little dirty after it rains.\"\n\nBecause Garno's roof is flat, like Nancy's, it easily gets dirty. So the pristine condition of Nancy's roof seemed off. \"That's just one thing to check,\" she said.\n\nOn Feb. 1, the Pima County Sheriff’s Department (CSPD) launched a search for Nancy, describing her as a “vulnerable adult.” Savannah’s mother was last seen on the evening of Saturday, Jan. 31, at her home. The PCSD ultimately declared her Tucson residence a crime scene and determined that she had been “taken” from her residence “against her will.”\n\nLaw enforcement confirmed that the blood discovered at Nancy’s home belonged to the 84-year-old. Investigators have since returned to to Savannah's mom's home several times, including with K9 units. As of writing, Nancy had not been found after looking into multiple ransom notes and issuing video messages to the captors through Savannah and her siblings.\n\nNext: Savannah Guthrie’s Mom Nancy Update: FBI Makes Arrest After Fake Ransom Note",
