    "fullText": "Dec. 15 (UPI) -- Inter Miami signed former Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United defender Sergio Reguilon to a two-year contract, the Herons announced Monday.\n\nReguilon, 28, joined Spurs in 2020, but spent time on loan with United, Atletico Madrid and Brentford during that tenure. The veteran left back will occupy an international roster slot for the Herons, who lost defender Jordi Alba and midfielder Sergio Busquets to retirement this off-season.\n\n\"It's a very ambitious project, a winning club that is doing things the right way, and that's what attracted me: coming here to keep winning and competing,\" Reguilon said in a news release.\n\n\"My objective is to keep winning, go after the trophies we're missing, and win everything here.\"\n\nReguilon, a graduate of Real Madrid's academy, also played on loan with Sevilla during his time with the Spanish La Liga power. He made six appearances for the Spanish national team. His contract with Spurs expired last summer.\n\nThe Herons will meet LAFC in their 2026 regular season opener Feb. 21 in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum. They are schedule to open their new stadium with a match against Austin FC on April 4 in Miami.",

    "fullText": "The second weekend of December provided us with one of the best two-day stretches of the young 2025-26 men’s college basketball season so far.\n\nHere are the 10 teams that got the biggest boosts from the mid-December madness that just transpired.\n\nThe Johnnies had no problem with Iona in a 91-64 win that had special meaning to head coach Rick Pitino. After being essentially exiled from the sport following his dismissal at Louisville, Pitino was thrown a lifeline by Iona in 2021, and then led the Gaels to two NCAA Tournament appearances in three seasons.\n\n“Iona’s got a really good team,” Pitino said after the game. “Iona’s such a special place with great tradition. I owe them so much. We’re going to play this game every year that I’m the coach.”\n\nThe Buckeyes avoided what would have been a big hit to their early NCAA Tournament resume by roaring back from a 16-point second half deficit (regardless of what the tweet below says) and taking down West Virginia in double overtime.\n\nThese are the types of games and moments that are easy to gloss over in the dead of December, but often ultimately decide the last teams in or out of the NCAA Tournament.\n\nConference realignment might have ruined the football version of “Bedlam,” but props to the basketball programs for carrying the torch.\n\nLike Ohio State, Oklahoma really needed this win to keep a “ok, not great” early season resume before diving head first into a conference play gauntlet. The Sooners exploded for 13 made three-pointers to win their fourth consecutive game over Oklahoma State.\n\nYes, Kentucky finally got a win over a team with a pulse, but perhaps more importantly, the Wildcats avoided a loss that felt like it had the potential to push Big Blue Nation over the edge.\n\nThe Wildcats had been the most disappointing team in college basketball through the season’s first six weeks. The fan base did not love the way Mark Pope handled his first real dose of adversity. A home loss to a hated rival that every member of the UK program has looked down at for the entirety of their existence would have created a blue Christmas across the Commonwealth.\n\nIn his first game back from injury, Mo Dioubate was the ultimate difference-maker for Kentucky. The power forward transfer from Alabama scored 14 points and pulled down a season-high 12 rebounds in his first game action since Nov. 13. That’s a huge boost for a team that was in desperate need of one.\n\nThe Broncos continue their early recovery from one of the worst opening night losses in the history of college basketball, their 79-78 defeat at the hands of Division-II opponent Hawaii Pacific. Since then, Boise has taken two far more understandable losses (USC and NC State in Maui) and has knocked off Wichita State, Butler, and now Saint Mary’s in a 68-67 thriller on Sunday.\n\nSt. Mary’s gets a chance with 7 seconds left but an untimely slip from Joshua Dent spoils their plans and Boise State pulls off the upset 68-67 pic.twitter.com/H4vIDduLqA\n\n— NCAA Buzzer Beaters & Game Winners (@NCAABuzzerBters) December 15, 2025\n\nSuddenly, Boise State finds itself inside the top 40 at No. 39 in the latest NET Rankings. That’s the second-best ranking of any team from the Mountain West, trailing only No. 30 Utah State.\n\nThe Mountain West is down this season, so Boise will need to be near-perfect in conference play to have a shot at an at-large bid to the NCAA Tournament. Thanks to Sunday’s win, though, there is at least a path.\n\nThe Zags got the better of modern rival UCLA in a late-night neutral court battle in Seattle. Graham Ike’s 28 points and overall inside dominance proved to be the biggest difference, as Mark Few’s team withstood a strong shooting performance from the Bruins’ Tyler Bilodeau to win, 82-72.\n\nIf Gonzaga is able to take care of Oregon this Sunday, they’re almost certain to begin play in their final season as a member of the West Coast Conference with just one defeat (a 40-point blowout against Michigan in the Players Era Festival championship game). A gaudy overall record, a top 3 national seed, and a 752nd national debate over whether the Zags are actually good enough to win the national championship appears to be on the horizon for yet another March.\n\nIt’s nice for college basketball to have at least a few unvarying North Stars during this period of overwhelming change.\n\nIt feels a little wrong to call Kansas a “winner” after a weekend where star freshman Darryn Peterson was forced to leave the team’s game at NC State after appearing to aggravate the hamstring injury that has been bothering him since the beginning of the season. Still, the Jayhawks got a miraculous performance from Melvin Council Jr. as they outlasted the Wolfpack, 77-76 in overtime.\n\nCouncil, who said afterwards that the most three-pointers he’d ever made in a game at any level was “two or three,” buried a whopping nine triples and netted a career-high 36 points to keep KU from dropping its fourth game before Christmas.\n\nThe issue with Peterson — who reportedly said on Monday that his issue during the game wasn’t hamstring related — is still of significant concern, but this was a win that Kansas really needed to get in order to round out its non-conference resume. The Jayhawks now have a pretty light slate until the middle of January, which will hopefully give the superstar freshman ample time to heal whatever needs healing.\n\nAre the Razorbacks the best team in the SEC? They’re certainly playing like it.\n\nArkansas notched its second top 20 win in two weeks with a 93-86 triumph over No. 16 Texas Tech Saturday afternoon in Dallas. The win was extra sweet considering it came eight months after the Red Raiders eliminated John Calipari’s team from the NCAA Tournament with a soul-crushing overtime comeback in the Sweet 16.\n\nThe difference for Arkansas against Tech was the continued uptick in production from forward Trevon Brazile. The versatile 6’10 senior hit 4 of his 5 three-point attempts and scored 18 of his team-high 24 points in the second half to help the Razorbacks overcome a double-digit deficit. Brazile also added 10 rebounds.\n\nThe performance of Brazile, coupled with 20-point efforts by both Darius Acuff and Karter Knox, lifted Arkansas to victory despite a 30-point, 11-rebound effort from Texas Tech All-American JT Toppin.\n\nArkansas has one major test — a neutral court showdown against No. 7 Houston on Saturday — remaining before the start of conference play.\n\nBefore this weekend, Arizona already had the best resume in college basketball and a team that appeared fully capable of winning the program’s second national championship.\n\nNow, Tommy Lloyd appears to have unlocked the full potential of 5-star freshman Brayden Burries. That’s not great news for the rest of the Big 12.\n\nBurries, the No. 9 overall player in the 2025 recruiting class according to 247 Sports, averaged just 7.8 points in Arizona’s first five games this season, and didn’t score more than 5 points in the team’s spotlight wins over UConn, Florida and UCLA. Against Alabama on Saturday, the 6’4 shooting guard exploded for a career-high 28 points as the Wildcats stomped No. 12 Alabama in Birmingham, 96-75.\n\nBurries, who hit five three-pointers and was 11-of-19 from the field overall, scored 15 points in four minutes during a game-defining stretch in the second half. For a team whose lone weakness this season had seemed to be outside shooting, the Burries performance proved that Arizona can win big games in virtually any way it needs to.\n\nWith the win over ‘Bama, Arizona is now the first team in 30 years to have five wins over AP top 25 opponents in its first nine games of a season.\n\nNebrasketball secured the best start in the history of the program (11-0) with easily its most impressive win of the season (and arguably the most impressive win of the Fred Hoiberg era), with a thrilling 83-80 road triumph over No. 13 Illinois.\n\nJamarques Lawrence’s game-winning three just before the buzzer also gave us one of the best moments of the first month and-a-half of the season, and nearly killed Cornhusker play-by-play man Kent Pavelka in the process.\n\n41-year Nebraska basketball play-by-play announcer Kent Pavelka’s (@KentPavelka) call of Jamarques Lawrence’s game winning 3 is GOLD 🤣🤣🤣 pic.twitter.com/Vofj6HyU1E\n\n— NCAA Buzzer Beaters & Game Winners (@NCAABuzzerBters) December 14, 2025\n\nWe also got this on-court view of the game-winner and resulting celebration via injured Cornhuskers guard Connor Essegian.\n\nTHE CRAZIEST THING I’VE EVER RECORDED. GAME TIME🔥👀 pic.twitter.com/9hbDYNeXms\n\n— Connor Essegian (@CEssegian) December 13, 2025\n\nThe ending was dramatic, but this was no fluke result. For 40 minutes, Nebraska — who had yet to notch a truly head-turning victory or play a true road game before Saturday — was the better team. They led Illinois by as many as 14 points in the first half and by as many as 10 in the second.\n\nLawrence got all the glory, but it was Pryce Sandfort and his career-high 32 points that did the most damage for the Huskers in Champaign. Rienk Mast added 17 points and 7 boards.\n\nWith the combination of their 11-0 start and last season’s championship in the inaugural College Basketball Crown post-season tournament, Nebraska has now won 15 consecutive games. That’s both the longest streak in program history and the longest active streak in men’s college basketball.\n\nInfamously, Nebraska is the only power conference program to have never won a game in the NCAA Tournament. Suddenly, it seems like we might very well be just a few months away from that not-so-fun fact disappearing from the Huskers’ resume forever.",

A hitter’s friendly ballpark, Citizen’s Bank would be the perfect new home for Murakami,” he wrote.\n\nIf someone had predicted just a few months ago that Murakami would only land $140 million over seven years, most would have been shocked.\n\nHowever, the reality is that he struggled quite a bit in Japan last year and also dealt with injuries. He isn’t the sure thing many expected him to be a few years ago, and that’s something Philadelphia has to consider.\n\nOn the flip side, the upside is enormous, and there’s plenty of reason to believe this might work out.\n\nPhillies seemingly ruined Mets plans after Kyle Schwarber, Pete Alonso deals\n\nPhillies All-Star strangely being floated in trade rumors during MLB winter meetings\n\nPhillies 'more likely than ever' to trade disgruntled $100 million All-Star\n\nPhillies receiving trade interest from Mariners on $7.5 million lefty reliever\n\nPhillies offseason rumor spells bad news for Alec Bohm's future in Philadelphia\n\nPhillies predicted to replace Ranger Suarez with in-house righty",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWe are 15 weeks into the 2025 NFL season, and some teams are jockeying for postseason position, while other players are just trying to put their best attributes on tape in hopes of improving their stock for next year. Speed is one of those key attributes that teams are always looking to stockpile.\n\nWhen the dust settled on Week 15, several playoff contenders were putting the pedal to the metal. A pair of Patriots were back in the mix once again, and one of the league's top defenders showed that speed isn't only a key asset on offense and special teams.\n\nHere is a look at the five fastest players in Week 15 of the 2025 NFL season.\n\nMORE: Updated AFC, NFC playoff pictures in Week 15\n\nAll speeds courtesy of NextGen stats.\n\nPlay type: 22-yard kickoff return\n\nThe New England Patriots duked it out with the Buffalo Bills in a huge AFC East divisional matchup.

    "fullText": "Real Madrid secured victory against Alaves on Sunday night, and with it, likely gave Xabi Alonso at least another week in the job. However the victory did not come without controversy, with Los Blancos irate at the decision not to award a penalty for a challenge on Vinicius Junior in the closing stages.\n\nThe Brazilian was seen shouting that ‘the only reason he didn’t give it is because it’s me’, while Xabi Alonso said that he ‘could not understand’ that VAR did not intervene in the incident. On Monday, during his Christmas address, Real Madrid President Florentino Perez pointed the finger at the Negreira case, where Barcelona stand accused of corruption, albeit have not been found guilty.\n\n“Christmas is a time to reflect on the things that concern us. In our case, our biggest concern is the state of refereeing in Spain. It’s a problem that has transcended our borders and damaged the credibility and reputation of our competition. As you know, the extremely serious situation following the ‘Negreira case’ over almost two decades deserves justice. I remind you that Real Madrid is the only club fighting for this,” Cadena SER quoted.\n\nPerez continued on a lengthy tirade about the case, referring to it as the biggest scandal in the history of the game.\n\n“It is completely incomprehensible that football institutions have abandoned Real Madrid in this fight. How is it possible that in the criminal case we are the only ones fighting for justice? How is it possible that the president of the referees is asking us to move on? How can we forget the biggest scandal in the history of football? We never will. How can the RFEF and LaLiga, who are supposed to safeguard integrity, behave this way? What explains their inaction? I trust that one day we will find out. They have a duty to protect the integrity of the competition and not appear complicit in such a serious case.”\n\n“Without a doubt, the ‘Negreira case’ is the most serious problem facing football today, even internationally. As has been published in recent days, we now know that more than €8m were paid for technical reports on referees – the most expensive reports in the world – and that the coaches, who were the intended recipients of these reports, weren’t even given them. Who can believe that millions of euros were paid for reports that apparently must have been useless? Because the coaches weren’t even given them; they apparently weren’t even aware of their existence.”\n\nThe referee in charge of the VAR during Real Madrid’s clash against Alaves was Pablo Gonzalez, who was also in charge of the VAR during the Copa del Rey final. Before that final, he stated that referees would not allow themselves to be harassed, and would be taking action, which was interpreted as a threat by Los Blancos.\n\n“Today we continue to live with the fallout from a case that tarnishes our sport (…) Just yesterday, we were officiated by a VAR referee who threatened to take action against our club the day before a Cup final. Can you imagine this situation in any other country? As you saw yesterday, or in Girona, it seems that the fouls suffered by Vinicius or Rodrygo aren’t penalties. They’re the refereeing novelty of this season.”\n\n“We are certain that we are not the only ones harmed. Furthermore, it is possible that some clubs have been relegated as a result of the ‘Negreira case.’ The integrity and decency of our sport are at stake. The image of our football has been seriously damaged, and therefore justice must be served because only in this way can Spanish football be regenerated.”\n\n“Do not forget that the investigating judge in the case described it as systemic corruption and that in interviews several directors have admitted that these payments were beneficial to their clubs. Beneficial why? Certainly, their coaches have stated that they neither knew about nor needed these reports.”\n\nFlick: \"Casadó as right-back? His strength is in midfield. He can play as a 6 or an 8.\"\n\n— barcacentre (@barcacentre) December 15, 2025\n\nThe coaches referenced by Perez are those of Ernesto Valverde and Luis Enrique, who gave evidence in the Negreira case on Friday. Both confirmed that they had not seen the consultancy reports that Barcelona allegedly paid Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira, then CTA Vice-President, for. All the same, both went on to confirm that in their view, at no point had they felt benefitted by officials during their time in charge of Barcelona. This is the second time in quick succession Perez has attacked on this front, after using his platform at Real Madrid’s General Assembly to do so.",

    "description": "The former New York Ranger of 13 years took his first steps in the visitor's locker room at Madison Square Garden, as Kreider looked forward to tonight's game with his new Anaheim teammates in New York.",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK – Chris Kreider mulled the question as he stood outside the visitor’s locker room at Madison Square Garden as an opposing player for the first time.\n\n“Is there one moment that stands out from his 13 years as a Ranger?\"\n\n“That’s a hard one,’’ he said with a smile. “I don’t know.”\n\nNo surprise there as there are countless possibilities for such an answer: his 2012 postseason burst as a rookie playing for John Tortorella, an playoff overtime goal against Boston in 2013, the team's run to the Stanley Cup Final in 2014 – not to mention Kreider's 326 career goals which third-most behind Hall of Famers Rod Gilbert and Jean Ratelle.\n\nKreider on Monday night will be wearing jarring-to-New York-fans Anaheim Ducks orange. He was trying his best to play it cool before what has to be as emotionally charged a return as a former Ranger has experienced since Mark Messier came back to the Garden as a Vancouver Canuck in 1997.\n\n“I'm trying to go in with no expectations and just get ready to play a hockey game. But it's a passionate fan base. It's a place that I've spent the majority of my life, so I'm sure it'll be emotional for me. To what extent, I don't know. I'm just trying to worry about the game.\"\n\nFormer #NYR Chris Kreider addresses the media ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/hqOxVWNewQ\n\n— Mollie Walker (@MollieeWalkerr) December 15, 2025\n\nKreider will be joined in returnee (and likely video tribute) land by former Rangers captain Jacob Trouba who is also playing his first game back since he was traded to Anaheim just over a year ago. Trouba’s road out of New York was rocky and since the physical defenseman played six seasons for Winnipeg, he doesn’t have the lifetime Ranger vibe Kreider possessed until last June when the 2009 Rangers first-round draft pick  was shipped to the Ducks to reunite with Trouba in sunny California.\n\n“I think coming back and seeing familiar faces and seeing friends in the city, that's all great,'' Trouba said. \"I think there's obviously the emotions that come with it. There's not really a playbook for that and how to deal with it. I think I'll also be excited when it's over.\"\n\nKreider and Trouba will be joined by two more former Rangers with the Ducks – Ryan Strome and Frank Vatrano – both key factors in New York’s run to the 2022 Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOne key figure in Monday night’s hockey drama – Kreider’s best friend as Ranger Mike Zibanejad – will not be on the ice as he will be scratched for missing a team meeting. Kreider and Zibanejad were teammates for nine seasons.\n\nDucks coach Joel Quenneville has repeatedly praised the presence of Kreider, 34, and Trouba, 31, on the same roster with young Ducks such as 19-year-old Beckett Sennecke, the team’s 20-year-old leading scorer Leo Carlsson and rising defenseman Jackson LaCombe, 24.\n\n\"They have both brought a lot to the table this year. They have played extremely well” Quenneville said of Trouba and Kreider and their vast wealth of big-game experience. “They come to play hard and it's appreciated. Trouba has logged way more minutes than we would have thought early in the year and Kreids gives us that netfront presence that was lacking last year.”\n\nAs far as the invariable emotional swirl that comes on a night wearing opposing colors on Garden ice for the former Rangers – particularly Kreider who also played 123 playoff games (with 48 goals) as a Ranger – the veteran coach knows what to expect.\n\n“Internally I’m sure they can’t wait to get this one started,’’ he said. “Fans here are great. They are supportive in a lot of ways and I’m sure it will be special for them. It’s a meaningful game for us too … I’m sure both teams will be excited to play this game.”\n\nAllan Kreda is a New York-area sportswriter with bylines at The Associated Press and formerly of the New York Times.",

    "description": "Early Jaguars vs. Broncos predictions for Week 16. Jacksonville goes toe ot toe with Denver.",
    "fullText": "The game with the biggest playoff implications this weekend could be the Jacksonville Jaguars at the Denver Broncos, something I'm sure every football fan saw coming in Week 1.\n\nTrevor Lawrence and the Jags are flying high since their bye week and have shot to the top of the AFC South. Meanwhile, the Broncos and Bo Nix hold the top spot in the AFC, but also have the Chargers nipping at their heels.\n\nHere are my early Jaguars vs Broncos predictions and NFL picks for Sunday, December 21.\n\nHere are our early thoughts on the spread and total for this week’s game. We will have a full game preview (with a best bet and SGP) later in the week.\n\nThe Jacksonville Jaguars have been hard for oddsmakers to figure out. After failing to cover in a four-game span by an average of 9.5 points, they’ve now covered in five straight by an average margin of 16.6.\n\nThe biggest key to their success on defense has been their ability to get to the quarterback, but the Denver Broncos feature the lowest sack rate allowed in the NFL. Bo Nix has thrived in an offense designed to get the ball out quickly, with 18.5% of his throws going to targets behind the line of scrimmage and nearly 63% going less than 10 yards.\n\nBut for all their impressive metrics, the Broncos are giving up yards on defense of late. While they came back this weekend from a nine-point hole against the Packers, it’s worth noting the rash of injuries Green Bay suffered in the second half.\n\nIn the seven games since Jacksonville’s bye week, Trevor Lawrence has thrown for nearly 1800 yards and 18 touchdowns against just six interceptions. Liam Coen is scheming receivers open, and will use the run game to slow the Denver pass rush.\n\nNix’s inability to throw downfield negates Jacksonville’s coverage issues. Combine that with Jacksonville’s highly-ranked rush defense and dangerous pass rush, and Cam Little drilling kicks in the thin air at Mile High, and I’m banking on the Jaguars once again being undervalued in a spot where I’m getting an even three points.\n\nJacksonville hasn’t been held Under 25 points since the bye week, but four of those six games have seen the game total stretch past the 50-point mark. That has led to the Over hitting in five of the last seven games.\n\nAnd I’m expecting this game to breach the 50-point mark as well, which has me squarely on the Over. Denver’s run defense has been leaky the past few weeks, and that will let the Jaguars move the ball. Add in Little’s leg, and they should score anytime they get near midfield.\n\nNix won’t push the ball downfield as some teams do against the Jaguars, but Denver’s quick-pass scheme will help keep drives alive and negate some of the Jags' pass rush. He’ll also put together enough drives against a defense that struggles to get stops on third and five or less.\n\nThese two offenses are too good to be held below 24 points. Take the Over and enjoy what could be the game of the weekend.\n\nJaguars vs. Broncos spread: Broncos -3\n\nJaguars vs. Broncos moneyline: Jaguars +138, Broncos -164\n\nJaguars vs. Broncos Over/Under: 45.5\n\nDate: Sunday, December 21, 2025, 4:05 p.m. ET\n\nVenue: Empower Field at Mile High\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "fullText": "Colorado defensive tackle Jehiem Oatis is planning to enter the NCAA Transfer Portal, per On3’s Pete Nakos.\n\nTo keep up with the latest players on the move, check out On3’s Transfer Portal wire. The On3 Transfer Portal Instagram account and Twitter account are excellent resources to stay up to date with the latest moves.\n\nMeanwhile, the NCAA Division I Administrative Committee passed dates for the one-time-only college football transfer portal back earlier in October. As it stands, the 2025-26 college football transfer portal will last 15 days. It’ll span Jan. 2 to Jan. 16, the NCAA announced.\n\nMoving forward, the entire Division I football notification of transfer windows is slated for Jan 2-16. As has been the previous standard, athletes on College Football Playoff teams still playing would have 5 days beginning the day after their team’s final game to enter the transfer portal.\n\nAdditionally, players have 15 days to enter the portal, but they’re not under a deadline to commit when they enter. Traditionally, the deadline for committing is how late a school can enroll a player through admissions.\n\nOne caveat is that if a head coach is fired, the transfer portal will not open for players immediately. The NCAA revealed that moving forward, players will only have 15 days to enter the portal after a coaching change, instead of the former allocation of 30 days. Players will also have to wait five days after a new coach is hired or announced.\n\nFinally, graduate transfers also cannot enter the transfer portal until Jan. 2 with the new one-time-only portal window. All these new guidelines are bound to shake things up, but the transfer portal will still remain as interesting and entertaining as ever.",

He believes he helped the club when it needed him, whether by renewing his contract or deferring part of his salary to facilitate the registration of teammates.’\n\nFor this reason, it looks increasingly likely that Ter Stegen will remain on the Blaugrana’s books all the way through the summer of 2028.",

    "description": "From crowd violence on day one to meeting cricket royalty and kickabouts with kids - what happened on Lionel Messi's GOAT Tour of India.",
    "fullText": "Lionel Messi made headlines for all the wrong reasons on Saturday when his three-day tour of India descended into violence.\n\nThe Argentina legend was visiting the city of Kolkata at the start of a whistle-stop visit taking in four cities.\n\nMany of Messi's fans were left feeling short-changed when they failed to get a glimpse of one of the world's most famous players.\n\nIt was the first time Messi had been to India since 2011.\n\nThis is how his visit played out.\n\nFresh from helping Inter Miami win the MLS Cup for the first time, Messi was embarking on a promotional tour.\n\nIt was called the GOAT India Tour 2025 - GOAT meaning 'greatest of all time'.\n\nMessi was joined by Uruguay star Luis Suarez and Argentina's Rodrigo de Paul, who also play for Inter Miami.\n\nThe tour started in Kolkata on Saturday. The trio moved on to Hyderabad later that day, then to Mumbai on Sunday before finishing in New Delhi on Monday.\n\nIndia was the only country the tour visited.\n\nThere was a variety of ticket options to suit budgets.\n\nFor access to the stadium only, face value tickets cost 3,500 rupees (£29) for Kolkata and Hyderabad. For New Dehli, the price was 4,200 rupees (£35).\n\nHowever, this is about half the average weekly wage in India. But with tickets sold out, fans were paying much more for the chance to see Messi.\n\nReports in Indian media said some locals had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£99) to get in.\n\nAmong the other ticket types was a VVIP option which included a meet-and-greet with Messi, including a photograph. Only 100 were available at a price of one million rupees (£8,200).\n\nMessi landed in Kolkata at 01:30 local time. Thousands lined the roads and congregated outside his hotel to catch a glimpse of him.\n\nThe day began with the meet-and-greet ticket holders first up from 09:00 to 10:30.\n\nThen the day took a strange twist.\n\nA 70ft statue of Messi lifting the World Cup was unveiled by the former Barcelona icon.\n\nBut he was not present - it was a virtual unveiling. He was on a video screen and pressed a button on a remote control. At this point a blue sheet dropped to reveal the huge iron structure.\n\nMessi met with Bollywood actor Shah Rukh Khan before heading to Salt Lake Stadium for 11:30.\n\nThe plan was for him to be at the ground for an hour. He was gone after only 20 minutes and violence erupted because ticket holders did not get to see Messi among the throng of security, politicians and celebrities.\n\n\"Only leaders and actors were surrounding Messi. Why did they call us then? We have got a ticket for 12,000 rupees, but we were not even able to see his face,\" a fan at the stadium told Indian news agency ANI.\n\nOne angry supporter told the Press Trust of India news agency that people had paid the equivalent of a month's salary to see the eight-time Ballon d'Or winner.\n\n\"I paid 5,000 rupees for the ticket and came with my son to watch Messi, not politicians,\" they said.\n\n\"The police and military personnel were taking selfies, and the management is to blame.\"\n\nThere was supposed to be a friendly match, more of kickabout, with some local players but this did not happen.\n\nMessi was whisked off to Hyderabad.\n\nMessi walked out at the stadium waving to fans, but after his appearance was abruptly ended some frustrated supporters stormed the pitch and vandalised banners and tents, while others hurled plastic chairs and water bottles.\n\nWest Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee said she was \"deeply disturbed and shocked\" by the events.\n\nAnnouncing an enquiry, Banerjee apologised to Messi and \"sports lovers\" for the scenes at the stadium.\n\n\"The [enquiry] committee will conduct a detailed enquiry into the incident, fix responsibility, and recommend measures to prevent such occurrences in the future,\" she added on X.\n\nA spokesperson for Messi said he fulfilled the time commitment that had been agreed in advance. In terms of the organisation of the event itself, he referred the BBC to the apology issued by Banerjee on social media.\n\nKolkata's Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial piece that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\".\n\nSatadru Dutta, the event organiser, was arrested and a city court remanded him in police custody for 14 days.\n\nThe rest of the tour appears to have gone without a hitch, with fans getting to see Messi, Suarez and De Paul.\n\nThe Times of India reported how the event in Hyderabad went smoothly, with the stands full and Messi staying on the pitch for a full hour.\n\nAfter leaving Hyderabad, on Sunday Messi met with India cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.\n\nFog delayed their arrival into Dehli on Monday, where thousands of fans gathered inside New Delhi's Arun Jaitley Stadium and were treated to a half-hour appearance when the trio kicked balls into the stands, passed balls with a group of children and signed autographs.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

Heading into the Celtics' retooling campaign for the 2025-26 NBA regular season, the general consensus was that Boston was going to be bad after the exits of Al Horford, Jrue Holiday, Luke Kornet, and Kristaps Porzingis in free agency and via trades over the offseason, and that Mazzulla would be tested as a developmental coach for the first time.\n\nBut fast forward to the present, and it is clear that the Celtics are a good team with postseason potential despite those high-profile exits, and Mazzulla is a major part of the reason why given how well he is getting those younger replacements to play this season.\n\nThe folks behind the \"NESN\" YouTube channel put together a clip from their \"Boston Has Entered the Chat\" podcast talking it all over.

    "description": "TLDR: I made a CLI tool that can resolve an IP address to a country, US state and even a city....",
    "fullText": "TLDR: I made a CLI tool that can resolve an IP address to a country, US state and even a city. https://github.com/jimaek/geolocation-tool\n\nIt works well and confirms ipinfo's findings.\n\nRecently, I read how ipinfo finally proved what most technical people assumed: VPN providers don't actually maintain a crazy amount of infrastructure in hundreds of countries. They simply fake the IP geolocation by intentionally providing wrong location data to ARIN, RIPE, and Geo DB providers via geofeeds.\n\nThey achieved their results using a novel approach compared to other geo IP providers. Based on their blog and HackerNews comments, they built a large probe network and used it to trace and ping every (or most) IP addresses on the internet.\n\nThis latency and hop data, most likely along with advanced algorithms and data cross-reference, provides a reliable way of correctly detecting the physical geolocation of an IP address, without relying on faked data available in public sources.\n\nThis is a very interesting approach that makes total sense, and I'm sure their clients appreciate it and heavily rely on it.\n\nWhile I can't ping every single IP address on the internet from hundreds of locations just yet, I can do it to a limited subset using Globalping. So I decided to try it out and see if I can replicate their results and build a small tool to allow anyone to do the same.\n\nGlobalping is an open-source, community-powered project that allows users to self-host container-based probes. These probes then become part of our public network, which allows anyone to use them to run network testing tools such as ping and traceroute.\n\nAt the moment, the network has more than 3000 probes, which in theory should be plenty to geolocate almost any IP address down to a country and even a US state level.\n\nTo automate and simplify this process, I made a little CLI tool using the globalping-ts library. My original idea was simple:\n\nEssentially, what I had to do was simply create a few measurements and pass the location I needed using Globalping’s magic field, which would automatically figure out what I was looking for and select a few pseudo-random probes that fit the location and limit.\n\nNow initially, I used ping with 2 packets to run all measurements as quickly as possible, but I quickly realized it wasn’t a good idea as most networks block ICMP traffic. Next, I tried switching to TCP-based ping, which required trying a few popular ports to get it to work. I quickly realized this was too complicated and unreliable and switched to traceroute.\n\nIt worked perfectly. Even though traceroute uses ICMP by default, it did not matter to me if the target IP’s network allowed ICMP or not, I simply analyzed the latency of the last available hop. Even if you block ICMP, your upstream most likely allows it, and in most cases, it’s located in the same country.\n\nOf course, this means the resulting data is not 100% perfect. A better approach would be to analyze each IP using different methods, including TCP and UDP-based traceroute on different ports, and expand to the last few hops instead of just one. Maybe even try to figure out the location of the registered ASNs and use a weights system in combination with public whois info in order to “vote” for the right location based on different inputs. Probably even mark low certainty IPs to be retested with a double amount of probes. (end of rant)\n\nBut that’s something for a commercial provider to figure out, which it seems they did.\n\nFor continent detection, I decided to use just 5 probes per continent; the results were extremely accurate. Although for IPs just on the \"border\" of continents it might be ineffective, a higher amount of probes would generate better results. For this use case, it was good enough.\n\nMy home IP in central Europe was too easy to detect:\n\nIn phase 2, all we need to do is run a single measurement with the winning continent as the location and a higher limit. Initially, I started with 250 probes with great accuracy.\n\nEventually, I decided to drop down to 50 as the default. Based on my tests, the results continued to look really good, and it would allow the tool to be run even without authentication, as the Globalping API allows 250 tests per hour per IP and 50 probes per measurement.\n\nAlthough I recommend registering for a free account at https://dash.globalping.io/ and authenticating with a token to get up to 500 tests per hour and run more tests.\n\nNote: If you need more tests than that, you can either host a probe to generate passive credits to be used as tests, or donate via GitHub Sponsors. We will automatically detect it and credit your account.\n\nGreat, now we have a basic IP-to-country resolver that only takes a few seconds to provide a response, and I didn’t even have to understand or write any complicated math. Although I’m sure someone smarter could use a formula to geolocate IPs with even fewer probes and higher accuracy.\n\nFor phase 3, we want to resolve the US to a specific state or territory, just like ipinfo did, and luckily they even provided a few sample IPs and locations to benchmark against during testing.\n\nAgain, this was as simple as creating a new measurement with the USA as the location. I used 50 probes as the default limit and tested the NordVPN IP advertised as Bahamas but resolved to Miami by ipinfo.\n\nThe tool agrees, Florida is the correct location. But how accurate can this system be? Can we expand it to show the city too?\n\nLet's make a new phase, which again, will simply set the resulting country or state as the location and extract the city of the probe with the lowest latency. Here, since there are too many possible cities and towns per state and country, I expect the accuracy to be low and only point to the closest major hub. But in theory, this should be more than enough for use cases like routing or performance debugging.\n\nAnd here we go, the same result ipinfo got\n\nThe current results are good but could be better. The main problem is with how the magic field works: when setting, for example, 'Europe' as the location, it tries to spread the tests across all European probes but does not guarantee that every single country is going to be included.\n\nThis results in inconsistencies where a probe in the same country as the target IP was not selected, and so the tool assumes the IP is located in a different neighbouring country.\n\nTo fix this and make the results more consistent, you would need to change the selection logic and manually set every country per continent and US state. By passing the full list of countries/states to the Globalping API, you ensure that at least one probe in that location is going to be selected. Additionally, you fully control the number of probes per location, which is very important to control the accuracy.\n\nFor example, North America technically contains 43 countries and territories. This means you can't just set a limit of one probe per country, it is not enough to properly understand the latency to the target IP from the disproportionately larger USA. A better limit would be around 200 probes for the USA, 20 for Canada, and 10 for Mexico.\n\nBut the goal of this tool was to use a minimum amount of probes to allow unauthenticated users to test it out. The current approach works great, it is simple to implement and it is very easy to control the accuracy by simply setting a higher limit of probes.\n\nOverall, latency-based geolocation detection seems to be a great way to verify the location of any IP as long as you have enough vantage points. It will most likely fall apart in regions with minimal or no coverage.\n\nThe tool itself is open source and you can run it like this:\n\nYou can also use the –limit parameter to use more probes per phase. But be careful as it applies the set value to all phases and this will very quickly eat through your limit. Check the full docs in GitHub.\n\nPull requests with improvements are welcome!\n\nFeel free to email me if you need some free credits to play around with d@globalping.io\n\nAnd of course consider hosting a probe, it’s as simple as running a container https://github.com/jsdelivr/globalping-probe",

It’s whispered in the circles of financial masters of the universe, Hollywood stars, and owners of sports teams. Have you heard about Fortell?\n\nMany haven’t—or if they did hear, they might not have made out the words through noisy cross-conversations. Once they do know—particularly if they’re boomers—they want it desperately. Fortell is a hearing aid, one that claims to use AI to provide a dramatically superior aural experience. The chosen few included in its beta test claim that it seems to top the performance of high-end devices they’d been unhappily using.\n\nThese testers have made pilgrimages to Fortell’s headquarters on the fifth floor of a WeWork facility in New York City’s trendy SoHo neighborhood, where they were fitted for the hearing aids—which from the outside look pretty much like standard, over-the-ear, teardrop-shaped devices. But the big moment comes when a Fortell staffer takes them down to street level. There, among street clatter, honking cabs, and delivery trucks backing up to luxury stores, they are asked to conduct a conversation with a Fortell worker. Two other employees stand behind them, adding their own loud discourse to the urban cacophony.\n\nDespite the din, the testers clearly make out what the person in front of them is saying. The clouds lift. Angels croon. “This was so incredible that I burst into tears,” says Ashley Tudor, one of the seemingly few beta testers who isn’t famous or powerful (though she is married to a venture capitalist).",

    "fullText": "The decision means TikTok now operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of Trump’s pen\n\nJudicial opinions allowing the government to suppress speech in the name of national security rarely stand the test of time. But time has been unusually unkind to the US supreme court decision that upheld the law banning TikTok, the short-form video platform. The court issued its ruling less than a year ago, but it is already obvious that the deference the court gave to the government’s national security arguments was spectacularly misplaced. The principal effect of the court’s ruling has been to give our own government enormous power over the policies of a speech platform used by tens of millions of Americans every day – a result that is an affront to the first amendment and a national security risk in its own right.\n\nCongress passed the TikTok ban in 2023 citing concerns that the Chinese government might be able to access information about TikTok’s American users or covertly manipulate content on the platform in ways that threatened US interests. The ban was designed to prevent Americans from using TikTok starting in January 2025 unless TikTok’s China-based corporate owner, ByteDance Inc, sold its US subsidiary before then.\n\nMany first amendment advocates and scholars – including the two of us – expected the court to be intensely suspicious of the law. After all, TikTok is one of the most popular speech platforms in the country, and banning foreign media is a practice usually associated with the world’s most repressive regimes. Even more damningly, a long list of legislators forthrightly acknowledged that their support for the ban stemmed not only from general concerns about what users might see on the app but from a desire to suppress specific kinds of content – especially videos showing the devastation caused by Israeli airstrikes in Gaza and other content deemed to be sympathetic to Palestinians. For laws that affect speech, motivations like that are usually fatal.\n\nBut the justices upheld the ban – unanimously – in a thin and credulous opinion issued just a week after oral argument. Apparently untroubled by legislators’ censorial motivations, the court said the law could be justified by privacy concerns, and it accepted without serious scrutiny the government’s argument that the ban was necessary to protect users’ data.\n\nPrivacy and security experts had told the court that banning TikTok would not in fact meaningfully constrain China’s ability to collect Americans’ data, and that if the government wanted to address legitimate privacy concerns online it could do so without so dramatically curtailing Americans’ free speech rights. But the court said that it was not the court’s job to second-guess the executive branch’s decisions about national security and foreign affairs.\n\nThis is not how the first amendment is supposed to work. For one thing, courts are not supposed to close their eyes when the government says it wants to control what people can say or hear. A law motivated by a desire to suppress particular categories of content – to suppress “misinformation, disinformation, and propaganda”, as the House committee report on the bill put it – should at the very least be subject to stringent review.\n\nAnd courts are not supposed to allow the government to side-step that review simply by declaring that national security requires censorship. That is the central lesson of the last hundred years of first amendment doctrine.\n\nDuring the first Red Scare, courts allowed the government to use the Espionage Act to imprison hundreds of activists for nothing more than opposing the war. The cases from that time are regarded as stains on first amendment history, and modern first amendment doctrine evolved as a reaction against these mistakes. Courts are supposed to have learned that it is their job to protect the democratic process by being skeptical of purported national security justifications for suppressing speech.\n\nEvents since the Supreme Court upheld the TikTok ban have only underscored why the justices were wrong to defer to the government’s arguments. The court issued its ruling on 17 January because the ban was meant to go into effect two days later. But even after the court rushed to judgment, Donald Trump issued an order saying he would suspend enforcement of the law for 75 days.\n\nSince then, he has extended this suspension four more times without any legal basis—and he may extend it again. Meanwhile, TikTok remains freely available. Legislators who were insistent that TikTok poses an urgent threat to American security cannot be reached for comment. All of this makes a mockery of the government’s earlier claims that TikTok was an urgent national security risk – and of the court that deferred to those claims.\n\nEven worse, the court’s decision means that TikTok now operates under the threat that it could be forced offline with a stroke of the president’s pen. Conservatives and liberals alike have expressed concerns for years about government officials using threats to “jawbone” social media companies into changing their content-moderation policies, but no previous administration has enjoyed the power to extinguish a platform simply by enforcing existing law.\n\nWhether TikTok is already conforming its policies to Trump’s preferences – as many American universities, media companies and law firms have been doing – is difficult to know. Even if the platform is not conforming now, though, it may well in the future, because Trump has been brokering a deal to have the platform transferred to his ideological allies.\n\nPlainly, the court cannot be blamed for all of this. It could not have predicted that President Trump would simply refuse to enforce the law. Still, we could have avoided this ending if the court had not bungled the beginning. If the court had carefully scrutinized the government’s national security arguments, it would have seen that the TikTok ban, for all of its novelty, is actually just a familiar example of the government exploiting national security fears to intimidate courts into giving it power that the constitution puts off limits.\n\nThe court would have understood that the ban itself created a serious national security risk – the kind of risk the modern first amendment was intended to prevent – by giving the government far-reaching influence over public discourse online.\n\nOver the coming months, the supreme court will confront other cases in which the government invokes national security to justify the suppression of speech. The court’s analysis of those cases should be haunted by the TikTok case and its embarrassing, scandalous coda. We need the court to play its constitutionally appointed role – and not simply defer credulously to political actors deploying the rhetoric of national security in the service of censorship.\n\nEvelyn Douek is an assistant professor at Stanford Law School\n\nJameel Jaffer is inaugural director of the Knight first amendment institute at Columbia University",

    "fullText": "AI Mode is mangling recipes by merging instructions from multiple creators – and causing them huge dips in ad traffic\n\nThis past March, when Google began rolling out its AI Mode search capability, it began offering AI-generated recipes. The recipes were not all that intelligent. The AI had taken elements of similar recipes from multiple creators and Frankensteined them into something barely recognizable. In one memorable case, the Google AI failed to distinguish the satirical website the Onion from legitimate recipe sites and advised users to cook with non-toxic glue.\n\nOver the past few years, bloggers who have not secured their sites behind a paywall have seen their carefully developed and tested recipes show up, often without attribution and in a bastardized form, in ChatGPT replies. They have seen dumbed-down versions of their recipes in AI-assembled cookbooks available for digital downloads on Etsy or on AI-built websites that bear a superficial resemblance to an old-school human-written blog. Their photos and videos, meanwhile, are repurposed in Facebook posts and Pinterest pins that link back to this digital slop.\n\nRecipe writers have no legal recourse because recipes generally are not copyrightable. Although copyright protects published or recorded work, they do not cover sets of instructions (although it can apply to the particular wording of those instructions).\n\nWithout this essential IP, many food bloggers earn their living by offering their work for free while using ads to make money. But now they fear that casual users who rely on search engines or social media to find a recipe for dinner will conflate their work with AI slop and stop trusting online recipe sites altogether.\n\n“There are a lot of people that are scared to even talk about what’s going on because it is their livelihood,” says Jim Delmage who, with his wife, Tara, runs the blog and YouTube channel Sip and Feast.\n\nMatt Rodbard, the founder and editor-in-chief of the website Taste, is even more pessimistic. Taste used to publish recipes more frequently, but now it mostly focuses on journalism and a podcast (which Rodbard hosts). “For websites that depend on the advertising model,” he says, “I think this is an extinction event in many ways.”\n\nThe holiday season is traditionally when food bloggers earn most of their ad revenue. For many, this year has been slower than usual. One blogger, Carrie Forrest of Clean Eating Kitchen, told Bloomberg that in the past two years, she has lost 80% of her traffic.\n\nOthers, like Delmage and Karen Tedesco, the author of the blog Familystyle Food, say their numbers, and ad revenue, have remained steady – so far. They attribute this to focusing their energies less on trying to game the search engines than on the long-term goal of attracting regular followers – and, in Delmage’s case, viewers.\n\nTedesco’s strategy has been to create recipes that rely on her experience and technical knowhow honed by years in restaurant kitchens and as a personal chef. Her Italian meatball recipe, for example, based on her mother’s, includes advice about which meat to use, an explanation of why milk-soaked breadcrumbs are essential for texture, and a dozen process photos and a video.\n\nBut she is still worried about the potential impact of AI. When she recently did a Google search for “Italian meatballs”, Familystyle Food appeared as the top result. Then she switched to AI Mode. There, she found the recipe had been Frankensteined – or “synthesized” as Gemini put it – into a new recipe with nine other sources (including Sip and Feast and a Washington Post recipe for Greek meatballs). The AI-generated recipe was little more than a list of ingredients and six basic steps with none of the details that make Tedesco’s recipe unique.\n\nAI Mode linked to all 10 recipes, including Tedesco’s, but, she says, “I don’t think many people are actually clicking on the source links. At this point, they’re absolutely trusting in the results that are getting thrown in their faces.”\n\nOther bloggers have seen a more definite impact on their viewership. Adam Gallagher, who runs Inspired Taste with his wife, Joanne, and who has become an outspoken critic of AI on social media, told the podcast Marketing O’Clock that since spring, he has noticed that while the number of times viewers saw links to the site on Google has increased, the number of actual site visitors has decreased. This indicates, to him, that users are satisfied with the search engine’s AI interpretation of Inspired Taste’s recipes.\n\nAfter the Gallaghers posted about the discrepancy on X and Instagram, a number of readers replied to say they had not realized there was a difference between the recipes on the blog and the version that showed up in Google searches. They had just appreciated the convenience of not having to click on another website, especially when Google’s page design was so clean and uncluttered.\n\nRodbard acknowledges that many food blogs have gotten ugly and overloaded with ads, which has exacerbated the problem. “Ad tech on these recipe blogs has gotten so bad, so many pop-up windows and so much crashing, we kind of lost as publishers,” he says.\n\nAccording to Tom Critchlow, the EVP of audience growth at Raptive, a media company that works with many food bloggers to find advertisers, it isn’t ads that are driving viewers away. It’s Google itself, with its changes to the algorithm and now with AI Mode, that’s making the sites harder to find.\n\nThere is some hope though: a survey of 3,000 US adults commissioned by Raptive showed that the more interaction people had with AI, the less they wanted to engage with it, and nearly half the respondents rated AI content less trustworthy than content made by a human.\n\nBut unless the public rebels against AI Mode, there is only so much bloggers can do. They can block OpenAI’s training crawler, which gathers information that ChatGPT uses to create content, including its own recipe generator, but theyare not necessarily willing to make themselves invisible to web searches; as Delmage puts it: “You can’t bite the hand that feeds you.”\n\nThere is also the option of moving over to a subscription model, such as Substack or Patreon, and keeping the recipes behind a paywall, but both Tedesco and Delmage point out that the most successful Substackers, like Caroline Chambers or David Lebovitz, came to the platform with much more substantial followings than they have. “If I were to give up my website or even try to go over to Substack, I would be broke,” Tedesco says.\n\nRodbard suggests that the analog version of the recipe blog, the cookbook, might be due for a comeback. Cookbooks, after all, offer the same experience of spending time and learning from a trusted source, and it’s likely the recipes have been tested. As a bonus, unlike phones or laptops, they don’t go dark when you neglect them for too long and you can splash tomato sauce on them without inflicting permanent damage. According to the market research firm Circana (formerly BookScan), sales of baking cookbooks are up 80% this year, but other areas have been relatively flat.\n\nBut AI bots are stealing from published cookbooks, too. When Meta was training its own AI, it compiled thousands of books into a dataset called Library Genesis (LibGen). Now unscrupulous publishers have raided LibGen and repackaged some of the books into dupes, which they are selling on Amazon.\n\nAs more people become aware of the amount of AI slop on the internet and how to identify it, Critchlow believes they will develop a greater appreciation for content produced by humans. “People will ultimately place a higher premium on being able to know that these recipes have been tested and made by somebody that I follow or somebody I respect or somebody that I like,” he says.\n\nThe recipe creators themselves are not so sure. “I’m putting my faith in that there’s always going to be a segment of people who really want to learn something,” Tedesco says. But as for the business of blogging itself, “it’s like a rolling tide. It’s always up and down and you have to roll with it and adapt.”",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates remain in a comfortable routine. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.13%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.53%. The Federal Reserve announced a third interest rate cut last week, and mortgage rates shrugged. The 30-year interest rate has barely moved since the end of October.\n\nSee which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.13%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.13% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,824, and you’d pay $356,569 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.53% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.53% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,456. But you’d only pay $142,085 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.13%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.53%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.24%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.13%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nNot much. According to its November forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026.

    "fullText": "One of the students killed in the mass shooting at Brown University is Ella Cook, who was a parishioner at the Cathedral Church of the Advent in Birmingham, Alabama, the church announced during its Sunday, Dec. 14, service.\n\n\"Many of you heard about the tragedy ... And sadly, tragically, one of those people is one of our parishioners,\" Rev. Craig Smalley said in livestreamed remarks.\n\nSmalley described Cook as a \"bright light\" who was engaged in the church and the broader community, and \"incredibly grounded and generous and faithful.\"\n\nCook's LinkedIn profile indicates that she began attending Brown in 2024.\n\nShe was vice president of the Brown Republicans, according to a social media post from Alex Shieh, who left the school earlier this year amid a furor over his DOGE-inspired \"bloat @ Brown\" campaign.\n\n\"Being a conservative at Brown isn't always the easiest, but Ella was never afraid to share her beliefs on an overwhelmingly liberal campus and support others in doing so,\" Shieh wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Last spring, while I was under a disciplinary investigation for reporting on Brown's administration for the conservative student paper, almost nobody wanted to be associated with me,\" he added. \"Ella was one of the few who were willing to stand with me in public and help hand out newspapers in front of the dining hall.\"\n\nAlabama U.S. Sen. Katie Britt expressed her condolences to the family of Ella Cook, calling the student’s death “heartbreaking” and “senseless,\" according to reporting from the Montgomery Advertiser.\n\nIn a statement, Britt said she and her husband, Wesley, “joined the Mountain Brook community and all of Alabama in mourning the heartbreaking loss of one of our own, Ella Cook, who was senselessly killed over the weekend on Brown University’s campus.”\n\nShe offered comfort to those who knew Cook, noting that her life was “taken far too soon” and expressing gratitude to law enforcement officials working on the investigation. Britt also asked that Ella’s loved ones and community be kept in prayers during this difficult time.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Dec. 14, WRAL News and the News & Observer, in Raleigh, North Carolina, reported that Kendall Turner, a Brown freshman, is among the injured students.\n\nTurner is an alumnus of Durham Academy in Durham, North Carolina, said an email sent to the school community, according to reports from both outlets.\n\nThe email said that Turner underwent surgery and is now resting in critical but stable condition. Her parents arrived in Providence on Saturday night.\n\nThis story has been updated with new information.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Providence Journal: Brown University student killed in mass shooting ID'd as Ella Cook",

    "description": "The billionaire founder admits a weekly mentorship call with the former president came with assignments like being more intentional with his friendships.",
    "fullText": "Preston Fore is a reporter on Fortune's Success team.\n\nTo build Airbnb into a billion-dollar business, Brian Chesky sometimes worked gruesome 100-hour weeks. However, on top of that, he would regularly carve out time to pick the brains of one of the most important people in the world: former President Barack Obama.\n\n“At one point in 2018, we had a standing one-hour call every week, and I basically had my day job during the day, and then I had my night school with the former president, where I would get these assignments, but it changed my life,” Chesky has just revealed.\n\nSpeaking on Michelle Obama’s podcast IMO, he added: “I just was really shameless about reaching out to him, asking for advice, asking for mentorship, and he would meet with me, and he’d give me advice.”\n\nHe recalled the 44th president of the United States advised him to avoid becoming like other leaders who are effectively “self-driving cars” without intention. Instead, he should always be thinking long and hard about relationships—with his friends, his success, and his company—and be more active with the impact he wants to make.\n\nFortune reached out to Chesky and former President Obama for comment.\n\nAfter building Airbnb into a household name, Chesky faced a problem: He still wasn’t satisfied—nor necessarily happy.\n\n“The thing about being very successful in tech and making a lot of money and all this is no one ever told me how lonely it would become,” Chesky said to Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson. “And I started realizing, well, it’s weird, I had old friends that were middle-class, and I’ll be honest, a lot of them seemed happier than me at that point in my life.”\n\nAnd he credits former President Obama with helping him realize that how he was feeling was completely normal: that “the more success you get, the more isolated you get.”\n\n“People dream of success, but what they don’t realize is a lot of with success comes disconnection to your past, to yourself, to your friends, and I think a lot of what I’ve tried to do the last handful of years is to reconnect, to not live a life of isolation,” Chesky said.\n\nBarack Obama’s wisdom to Chesky was simple: He needed to be more hands-on with his relationships. That means instead of texting or calling a close friend once a year, stay constantly connected with them. Chesky said it’s a lesson he translated into his work as the leader of Airbnb.\n\n“He told me something that I’ll never forget,” Chesky said. “He said you should institutionalize your intentions, so that even when you’re a public company, you can make sure not to compromise your vision. And what he meant by that, I think, was that you should be more thoughtful about what you’re making, why you’re making it, and the impact of what you’re making is on people.”\n\nChesky admitted Obama’s advice has made a “really, really big difference” at Airbnb. And while it may sound odd for a former president to effectively give a CEO homework, it’s nothing new for Obama, who spent over a decade in the classroom teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago before his jump into the political arena.\n\nThe lessons learned from Chesky and President Obama’s relationship on finding success can be summarized into two simple steps: Seek out mentors and have friends outside of social media.\n\n“For young people, the number one thing they need to learn how to do is how to learn,” Chesky said. “And some of the best ways to learn are from other people, and some of the best ways to learn from people are, again, in the real world.”\n\nMoreover, rekindling old relationships is among what Chesky calls a “simple life hack” to make life happy.\n\n“I think the vast majority of people, if they reach out to someone, someone will want to help them,” he added. “They reach out to an old friend, the old friend will want to reach back out to them, and that is the path for reconnection. It’s a path for relationships, and it’s a path for purpose.”\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on May 27, 2025.",

    "title": "Rich Western countries face a stark choice: 6-day workweeks or more immigration, top economist warns",
    "description": "One of the world's foremost economists, Lant Pritchett, has a plan.",
    "fullText": "Eva is a fellow on Fortune's news desk.\n\nA specter is haunting Europe—the specter of aging.\n\nMany Western countries are facing what the World Bank calls a “profound demographic crisis.” The twin perils of an aging population and record-low fertility rates are predicted to send their populations plunging in the coming decades.\n\nThe worst consequences of this demographic shift, per the World Bank, are economic. Soon the shrinking working population in the U.S., Canada, or Germany won’t be able to meet their own constant demands for high-quality goods and services. These rich, senescent countries will have to make a hard choice for economic survival: force people to work more, or allow immigrants to fill in?\n\nLant Pritchett, one of the world’s top thinkers on developmental economics, has seen this crisis coming for decades over his career at Harvard, the World Bank, and Oxford University, where he currently heads a research lab. He told Fortune his radical plan to stave off economic disaster.\n\nIn the long run, without intervention, the UN predicts a decline in population growth could cascade into a full-on population “collapse.” That collapse is not likely to occur until well into the next century—if it comes at all. However, in the short run, population decline presents a real and relatively simple economic problem: The West soon won’t have enough workers.\n\nThe ratio of working-age people to elderly people in rich countries will soon become so diminished that support for elders will be unaffordable. In Japan, a nation already facing the consequences of a graying population, the average cost of nursing care is projected to increase 75% in the next 30 years, with Prime Minister Fumio Kishida warning the nation is on “the brink.” In the U.S., think tanks have warned, an older population with more retirees means a shrinking tax base and higher demands on programs like Social Security and Medicare, along with a smaller number of working-age people to pay into those programs.\n\nIn short, we have a “ticking time bomb” on our hands, in the words of Greece’s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis, whose government introduced a six-day workweek last year to address the nation’s labor shortages. The move prompted fury and protests among workers as they watched their German and Belgian cousins embrace four-day workweeks.\n\nIndeed, even as some European countries and a few American companies flirt with working less, panicked economists and politicians are sounding the alarm: We need to work more. A study conducted by consulting firm Korn Ferry found by 2030, there will be a global human talent shortage of more than 85 million people, roughly equivalent to the population of Germany. That talent shortage could slash $8.5 trillion from nations’ expected revenues, affecting highly educated sectors such as financial services and IT as well as manufacturing jobs, which are considered “lower skilled” and require less education.\n\nNow is the time to act, economic veteran Pritchett told Fortune. But doing so involves some radical rethinking of the current immigration debate.\n\nClassical economics offers a number of ways to address a labor shortage, Pritchett said. Since most of the unfilled jobs are “unskilled,” or don’t require a degree to complete, one solution for businesses and governments is to invest in automation, essentially having robots fill the gap. But while automation helps get the jobs done, it depresses human workers’ wages by decreasing the number of jobs available, “exacerbating” the issue, Pritchett said.\n\nSome have called for increasing wages to induce more people to work. But most of the working-age population in the U.S. is already employed. Despite a well-documented decline in the portion of working-age men with jobs over the past few decades, Pritchett said the vast majority of working-age men are working, meaning raising pay would have small effects at best. There’s room for more women to work, he noted, but that could take away from other important responsibilities that are overwhelmingly shunted to women, such as caring for family or raising children.\n\nThat leaves two other options: forcing workers to work more or allowing an influx of legal, controlled immigration.\n\nMitsotakis’s plan for a six-day workweek is a step in the right direction for the short term, Pritchett said.\n\nBut “economics is not just about direction: It’s about magnitude,” he added. In other words, he says, small policy tweaks won’t do it. If we’re trying to address a big, structural problem with the U.S. labor force, the solution needs to be ambitious and comprehensive—precisely the type of legislation American politicians have largely avoided in recent years.\n\nIf policymakers simply try to make everyone work an additional day, the math simply won’t work out in the long run, Pritchett said. Even if Greece has “fantastic success” and increases its working hours by 10% over the next 30 years, that growth would represent a “drop in the bucket” in fighting a worsening labor shortage. He calculated a demographic labor force gap of 232 million people globally in his most recent paper, even assuming the highest possible labor force participation rate.\n\n“You can’t solve a problem that’s growing over time with [a labor force] that has an upward bound,” he said. You would have to keep the labor force working more and more, and even then, you would never be able to fill in the gap.\n\nPritchett has a better idea. He knows the current immigration debate is fraught, since the West is concerned with the social ramifications of allowing more migrants into its borders. But he maintains the only way to solve rich countries’ labor problem is to let in immigrants to work, particularly from countries where population growth is increasing, such as Nigeria or Tanzania, rather than decreasing.\n\nIn his view, the Western debate on immigration has taken on an unnecessarily binary flavor, with the choice depicted as one between a path to citizenship or closed borders. In an article titled “The political acceptability of time-limited labor mobility,” Pritchett says the West will soon have to abandon this view. Instead, he advocates for developed nations to embrace a system where immigrants can come to their country to work for a limited time—while also buying goods and services, renting homes, starting companies, and hiring workers—and then go back home, leaving both parties wealthier.\n\nThe truth, Pritchett said, is the U.S. needs low-skilled migrants, and many migrants need the economic boost from working in the U.S. Immigration is a symbiotic relationship that the West cannot quit—that’s why it’s so hard for us to actually control our borders.\n\n“The way to secure the border is to create a legitimate way for people and firms to get the labor that the economy really needs in legitimate, legal ways, and until we have that, the whole debate over the wall and stuff is just silly,” Pritchett said.\n\nIf anything, the intensifying crackdown on undocumented and legal migration since the late 1980s has led to mass settlement, according to Hein de Haas, a sociologist of immigration. Prior to the 1980s, the U.S. and Mexico enjoyed a relationship similar to the work-visa program Pritchett envisions. Mexicans freely flowed across the border, coming for a short time to work, returning home to enjoy their money, and sometimes repeating this journey over several years, Haas wrote. They never permanently settled because, knowing they could come and go as they pleased, they did not have to.\n\nThe U.S. facilitated this temporary migration programs specifically aimed at Mexicans,  encouraging contract workers to come to the U.S. after  World War I and II. The second of these, the Bracero Program, established a treaty for the temporary employment of Mexican farmworkers in the U.S., and was so popular that it was extended far beyond its initial life span, allowing nearly 5 million Mexicans to temporarily work in the U.S. from 1942 to 1964. (The program ended in 1965, when the U.S. sharply limited immigration from Latin America as part of a major overhaul of immigration laws.)\n\nWhat Pritchett suggests isn’t too dissimilar from simply turning the clock back to a time when migrants could move and work freely. He proposes a fixed-term system: A worker comes to the U.S. with the understanding that they are not on a path to citizenship, works on a three-year contract, and then returns to their home country. After an “off period” of six months to a year, the migrant could come back for another three years.\n\n“There are a billion people on the planet who would come to the U.S. under those terms,” Pritchett said. “But we don’t have that available.”\n\nHe isn’t exaggerating about the billion. In a 2010 survey, Gallup asked people around the world whether they would like to temporarily move to work in another country. Some 1.1 billion responded “yes,” including 41% of the age 15-to-24 population and 28% of those ages 25-44, Pritchett said.\n\n“What you could make in America in three years and go back to Senegal with is a fortune compared to anything else you could do to make your way in Senegal,” he added. “You go back to Senegal, you build a house, you buy your own business, and you’ve transformed your life by working temporarily.”\n\nTo avoid potential labor shortages in sending nations, Pritchett’s system would depend on bilateral agreements between the host and sending countries, and nations “could choose to put limits on their participation” to address their own labor needs, Pritchett said.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. would receive fresh batches of workers for service industries, elderly care, or manufacturing—essentially, all the jobs that would be otherwise unfilled.\n\nPolicies like these are not yet being discussed on the national stage, but Pritchett believes that will soon change. With the upcoming labor shortage and the unpopularity of forcing workers to toil for longer, politicians will have to expand their understanding of immigration to allow for policies like his. For now, he’s planting the seed.\n\nIn partnership with economist Rebekah Smith, Pritchett has started an organization called Labor Mobility Partnerships (LaMP) that aims to build political support for a temporary rotational migration system. The way he sees it, nothing will change by pitching the idea to politicians (“who tend to be followers, not leaders”) so instead, he is working with countries that are currently already expanding their immigration channels, like Spain.\n\nHe is also courting business leaders in sectors that will be the hardest hit by labor shortages, such as elderly care, who could “be potentially a powerful force” in explaining to politicians why policies like his are necessary.\n\n“Ideas at times are like dams: huge, unmoving, impregnable, able to hold the water back forever,” Pritchett writes in the conclusion of his paper. “But a small, strategically placed crack can cause a dam to be washed away overnight.”\n\nA version of this story was published on Fortune.com on Aug. 4, 2024.",

At this point, you might think you'll need a Christmas miracle to get hired in the waning moments of 2025.\n\nBut unlike Santa Claus, your chances of getting hired in December are real, writes BI's Sarah E. Needleman.\n\nI don't mean to be a Grinch by telling you to spend your holidays applying for jobs. I get the feeling of wanting to shut it down for the year and give it a go in 2026. After all, it's been a brutal year for job seekers.\n\nBut recruiters and hiring managers told Sarah they're not slowing down, so neither should you. In some cases, they need to rush through hirings or risk losing any remaining budget for the year.\n\nAlso, what's the alternative? Wait until the New Year? That just means even more competition as people reevaluate their jobs after bonus season. There's also the risk of another wave of layoffs to kick off the new year, which will increase the candidate pool.\n\nSo set aside the eggnog for a bit and keep plugging away on those applications. Take it from me, it can happen.\n\nMy Business Insider work anniversary? December 10.\n\nJob hunting isn't the only thing you shouldn't hold off on until the New Year.\n\nAt the risk of sounding like a cringey LinkedIn influencer, the best time to do something is yesterday; the second-best time is now.\n\nHere are three other things you can check off your to-do list before midnight on December 31:\n\nA new home for the holidays. The holidays can be a great time to go home shopping. In fact, according to one real-estate investor and agent, you could get a better deal. A few days before Christmas is her favorite time to submit an offer because the seller could be distracted or keen to wrap things up before year's end.\n\nInvest then rest. If you're investing for the long haul — which, let's be honest, is the only way you should be investing — the end of the year could be a good time to dive in. Certain investment vehicles, like IRAs, have limits on yearly contributions, meaning you can load up before starting fresh next month.\n\nSilver (dumb)bells. Gyms in January are a mess. Front-run the New Year's resolution crowd and start getting your workouts in now. The last few weeks of December are my favorite: It's mostly empty, and the people there are the gym rats who are always the friendliest.

    "title": "Read the letter Netflix's co-CEOs sent to reassure staffers about its bid to buy Warner Bros.",
    "description": "Netflix laid out the rationale for acquiring Warner Bros, saying the deal is: \"pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth.\"",
    "fullText": "Netflix's co-CEOs want to assure staffers that its bid to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's key assets will be good for the company — and for jobs across Hollywood.\n\nIn a letter sent to staffers on Monday, a copy of which was also filed publicly with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos said a combined Netflix-Warner Bros. is \"pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth.\"\n\n\"We see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it,\" the Netflix co-CEOs wrote, addressing concerns that the combo of the streaming giant and one of the most iconic studios could bring about \"the end of Hollywood.\"\n\nNetflix this month announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets for an equity value of $72 billion, which would be the biggest acquisition in the streamer's history.\n\nRival Paramount Skydance responded days later with a hostile bid to acquire all of WBD in a deal valued at around $108 billion.\n\nPeters and Sarandos addressed the hostile bid in the letter, saying it was to be expected but that Netflix has a solid deal in place.\n\n\"It's great for our shareholders, great for consumers, and a strong way to create and protect jobs in the industry,\" they wrote.\n\nThe letter reiterated Netflix's previous arguments for why it's the best bidder for the WBD assets. Its bid faces strong opposition in parts of Hollywood, where many have long harbored suspicions toward Netflix because of its business model that has upended traditional film and TV conventions.\n\nIn particular, Netflix has favored a streaming-first distribution approach and has a practice of putting its movies in theaters for limited runs only. This has created tension with some big-name talent and movie theater owners. Sarandos previously said long, exclusive theatrical windows weren't \"consumer-friendly,\" and that he thinks, over time, theatrical windows will continue to shrink.\n\nIn terms of regulatory approval, both bidders have made the case that they have the clearest path to getting a deal through. Paramount chief David Ellison has said its combo would lead to less market concentration in streaming than Netflix's.\n\nNetflix, for its part, wants regulators to compare its market share to total TV watching time, including free platforms like YouTube. The co-CEOs emphasized this in a letter. They say Netflix plus Warner Bros. would only be 9% of the US market, behind YouTube and Disney. Paramount's argument is that the market should be defined by paid streaming, which is growing and where Netflix stands to expand its dominance.\n\nA wild card is President Donald Trump. David Ellison and his father, Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison, are close to Trump, whereas Sarandos has long-standing ties to prominent Democrats. Still, Trump has publicly praised both Netflix and Sarandos. Trump also said that a combo of Netflix and Warner Bros. \"could be a problem\" due to the size, however.\n\nWhen it comes to jobs, Netflix has lobbied Trump that it would be a job saver, not a job killer, since it wouldn't be combining two big studios like Paramount would. Some key numbers to look at are the planned \"synergies,\" which often translate in part to job cuts. Paramount estimated $6 billion, compared to Netflix's $2 billion to $3 billion.\n\nRead the letter from Netflix co-CEOs Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos to staffers in full below:\n\nBy: Greg Peters and Ted Sarandos\n\nAs news around our deal with Warner Bros. continued this week, we wanted to keep you as informed as we can. Our position hasn't changed: we strongly believe that Netflix and Warner Bros. joining forces will offer consumers more choice and value, allow the creative community to reach even more audiences with our combined distribution, and fuel our long-term growth. We made this deal because their deep portfolio of iconic franchises, expansive library, and strong studio capabilities will complement—not duplicate—our existing business.\n\nThis is going to be a complex process over the next year or so and there's a lot we won't be able to share, but we did want to give you our thoughts on some of the most pressing questions we've heard since we connected last week.\n\nHow do we feel about Paramount's hostile bid? It was entirely expected. But, we have a solid deal in place. It's great for our shareholders, great for consumers, and a strong way to create and protect jobs in the industry. We're confident we'll get it over the finish line—and we're genuinely excited about what's ahead.\n\nAre we confident regulators will approve? We believe in this deal—in the value it creates— and we're confident we'll get the approvals we need to make it happen. The fundamentals are clear: this deal is pro-consumer, pro-innovation, pro-worker, pro-creator, and pro-growth. Also, if you look at it through the lens of Nielsen data, even after combining with Warner Bros., our view share would only move from 8% to 9% in the US—still well behind YouTube (13%) and a potential Paramount/WBD combination (14%). We believe the facts speak for themselves, and we're fully prepared to put ourselves in a strong position for approval.\n\nWill we preserve theatrical releases as part of WBD's distribution model? Yes—we're fully committed to releasing Warner Bros. movies in theaters, just as they do today. Theatrical is an important part of their business and legacy, and we don't want to change what makes Warner Bros. so valuable. If this deal had happened two years ago, hits like Minecraft and Superman would still have premiered on the big screen as they did—and that's how we plan to keep it. We haven't prioritized theatrical in the past because that wasn't our business at Netflix. When this deal closes, we will be in that business.\n\nSome feel this is the end of Hollywood. What's our response to that? This is something that we've heard for a long time—including when we started the streaming business. Our stance then and now is the same—we see this as a win for the entertainment industry, not the end of it. This deal is about growth: Warner Bros. brings businesses and capabilities we don't have, so there's no overlap or studio closures. We're strengthening one of Hollywood's most iconic studios, supporting jobs, and ensuring a healthy future for film and TV production.\n\nWhat's next? We've got a small but mighty team of experts working on this so the rest of us can stay focused on the big 2026 ambitions we've established for our business. We've got huge potential still ahead of us—even before we factor in Warner Bros.—so our focus should remain on realizing that potential based on our organic growth. We know that's easier said than done with all the headlines and speculation, but continuing to deliver for our members is the best thing we can focus on.\n\nWhere is the best place to follow along? As a reminder, Take 5 is for employees only. We've launched a public site as our source of truth for external audiences—which will be updated further—and it's a resource you can share with friends and family who might have their own questions. You can also listen to our UBS webcast from earlier this week.",

    "fullText": "SpaceX is reportedly preparing for a monster IPO — and a booming Starlink is a big reason why.\n\nGlobal web traffic from SpaceX's satellite-based internet service more than doubled in 2025, according to data from Cloudflare, a cybersecurity company that handles tens of millions of requests between users and websites every second.\n\nIt's the latest year of explosive traffic growth for Starlink, which uses a constellation of more than 9,000 low-orbit satellites to provide internet connection, including to remote areas.\n\nSpaceX said in November that the service has 8 million active customers, up from 4 million in September 2024, and is now online in over 150 markets.\n\nAround 23 airlines have also announced plans to use Starlink to offer high-speed WiFi on their planes, and SpaceX has signalled it could soon launch its own mobile carrier service powered by the satellite network.\n\nStarlink's growth comes as reports suggest a colossal SpaceX public listing is on the cards. Elon Musk seemed to confirm on Wednesday that the rocket maker is considering an IPO as early as next year, which multiple outlets have reported could see SpaceX valued at around $1.5 trillion.\n\nThat would catapult SpaceX into the list of the world's most valuable companies, and potentially put Musk within touching distance of becoming the first-ever trillionaire.\n\nSince its founding by Musk in 2002, SpaceX has successfully commercialized reusable rockets, a feat previously thought impossible by many within the space industry, and now launches more cargo into orbit than any other company.\n\nIn the long term, SpaceX aims to fulfill its billionaire founder's ambitious visions of colonizing Mars and putting data centers in space with its giant Starship rocket.\n\nFor now, however, the Texas-based company's huge valuation is driven by the success of Starlink, with Musk saying this month that the satellite network was \"by far\" the largest driver of SpaceX's revenue.\n\nCloudflare's annual report found that in the more than 20 countries and regions where Starlink launched in 2025, internet traffic from its satellite service surged immediately after the service became available. Cloudflare said that internet traffic grew 295% in Botswana this year, with Starlink launching in the African country in August 2024.\n\nThere's no sign of Starlink slowing down, with SpaceX preparing to launch the service in India next year.\n\nThere's also little sign of major competition. Rival services, including Amazon's Leo and China's Spacesail, are attempting to build their own constellations, but they have launched fewer satellites than Starlink.",

Its cult-favorite berry Chantilly cake even went viral when the chain tried to change its recipe.\n\nBut just how good are Whole Foods' desserts, really?\n\nAs a professional baker, recipe developer, and former bakery owner, I always prefer home-baked desserts, but I recognize that sometimes you need a quick fix or an easy pick-up-and-go treat for a special occasion.\n\nSo, I shopped for a range of treats from my nearest Whole Foods store to see what's really worth buying.\n\nFirst, I tried the beloved berry Chantilly cake.\n\nThis treat has had a longtime cult following and is probably the most popular bakery item at Whole Foods.\n\nAccording to its ingredients list, it consists of vanilla cake, Chantilly icing and frosting, cream cheese, mascarpone cheese, raspberry syrup and puree, and a mixture of fresh berries — including strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries.\n\nI got a 6-inch round of it for $30.\n\nI've tried this cake before, and now for a second time, I still don't feel like it lives up to the hype.\n\nIs it better than many other grocery-store-bakery cakes? Yes. It's also wonderful that there's real, fresh fruit in the cake. But I was still longing for something a bit more for it to live up to its fame.\n\nThe cake layers were pretty dry, but the addition of the smooth Chantilly cream helps to make up for that. Though the ingredients list mentions raspberry syrup and puree, I couldn't seem to taste or find any of it.\n\nA few berries were added to the layers, with a thin layer of cream between each. Before owning my own bakery, I was a grocery-store cake decorator, and I can certainly understand how tricky these layers would be to stack with chunks of fresh fruit.\n\nOverall, the flavor is excellent, without the cake being too sweet — I just wish the texture of the actual cake layers were a bit more moist.\n\nTo me, a good cheesecake should have a flavorful, textured crust balanced by a smooth, rich filling.\n\nThis cheesecake slice was almost there but had a few shortcomings. The crust was soggy and reminded me of a sugar cookie. I'm a graham-cracker-crust fan, so this was a bit of a drawback for me.\n\nThe texture of the cheesecake filling was wonderfully smooth and rich, and the flavor wasn't too sweet, but it was pretty overwhelming. It had a very robust cheese flavor, and I wished for a bit more balance.\n\nI tried only one bite because I found it too overpowering, but I could see it being an excellent choice paired with a fruit sauce or fresh berries.\n\nA store employee told me the chocolate-eruption cake is another customer-favorite dessert (alongside the berry Chantilly cake, of course).\n\nI had a 6-inch cake boxed up from the bakery display cake for $27.\n\nI'm still thinking of this chocolate cake, which means it was a top winner for me.\n\nThe cake itself was stunning, with a ganache drip, piped details, and chocolate curls to spruce it up even further. The three layers of chocolate cake were wonderfully moist and tender — and pairing them with a chocolate-mousse filling made it even better.\n\nAs the name suggests, it was incredibly chocolaty, but it wasn't too rich. It was well-balanced for a chocolate lover to enjoy every bite.\n\nPackaged up and ready to grab out of the cold case, the family pack of tres leches cake looked quite unassuming.\n\nThe plain-looking piece cost me $14.\n\nWhat this dessert lacks in appearance, it certainly makes up for in flavor. Talk about finding a hidden gem!\n\nThe simple cake base is soaked in cream and sweetened condensed milk and finished with a whipped topping. The texture was incredible with an excellent, balanced flavor.\n\nEvery bite contained subtle notes of coconut and caramel that were neither too sweet nor overpowering.\n\nIt's perfect on its own, but there's certainly room to dress it up at home if you plan to serve it for a special occasion. A few sliced strawberries on top will go a long way.\n\nThere are plenty of cookie options in the Whole Foods bakery, but I chose something classic with a slightly elevated twist.\n\nI picked up a pack of four brown-butter chocolate-chunk cookies for $7.50\n\nPerfectly chewy and packed with flavor is the best way to describe these tasty cookies. I loved that they had chocolate chunks rather than chips — and there were plenty of them!\n\nThanks to the brown butter and vanilla extract, the flavor of this cookie was slightly enhanced compared with a typical chocolate-chip cookie.\n\nOverall, it was excellent in every bite.\n\nI found several flavors of Parisian macarons in the bakery display case. I chose one vanilla, one chocolate, and one salted caramel.\n\nI will always get macarons if they're offered at a bakery. I'm a forever fan, and I had high hopes for these offerings.\n\nI tried three different flavors, and though each tasted decent (especially salted caramel), their textures were a bit off.\n\nThe interiors of the macarons were chewy, but the exteriors were far too crunchy and dry for me.\n\nIt's hard for me to believe that a grocery-store bakery would produce a lackluster brownie, but I think Whole Foods has.\n\nThe top of the brownie was surprisingly dry and crackly, yet underneath, it had a wonderful cakey-meets-fudgy balance.\n\nUnfortunately, the dry top detracted from that.\n\nIn terms of flavor, I expected a wonderfully balanced, chocolaty brownie — but I thought it was relatively bland and disappointing.\n\nThe Whole Foods bakery had several flavors of pie, including pecan, four-berry, and apple.\n\nTo get a taste for the crust and fruit filling, I chose a 9-inch cherry pie for $15.\n\nEven for seasoned bakers, putting together a homemade pie can feel like a lot of work. For $15, this is a decent option if you aren't up to the task of making your own.\n\nThe not-too-sweet flavor was excellent. The crust, however, wasn't one bit flaky or buttery and seemed a bit soggy, as if it had been pulled out of the oven a few minutes too early. Still, I may have just gotten a dud.\n\nOverall, I wished for a better pie crust, but it's a decent option in a pinch.\n\nI hoped for an adorable cookie that also tasted fantastic, but I ended up disappointed.\n\nThese were definitely an impulse buy based on the cute shape and design of the cookie, but biting into one let me down.\n\nThe texture was fine, but the flavor was oddly artificial to me. I don't think they tasted balanced or buttery, and the hint of vanilla I was expecting didn't come through.\n\nWhole Foods sells tiramisu dessert cups, but there's also a whole tiramisu cake available in the bakery display case.\n\nI got a pretty 6-inch tiramisu cake for $27.\n\nMaking tiramisu isn't necessarily difficult, but it requires a few steps. If you want to skip them and buy it premade as a cake, this one from Whole Foods is a worthy option.\n\nThe two-layer dessert had terrific flavor thanks to the vanilla cake paired with a creamy, coffee-flavored filling. The top was dressed up nicely with even more piped cream, a dusting of cocoa powder, and chocolate curls.\n\nI think it's a bit pricey for what it is, but a good option if you need to pick up a showstopping dessert for a special occasion.\n\nThis story was originally published on November 20, 2024, and most recently updated on December 15, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Planning a Caribbean vacation? The US State Department wants you to know how safe your destination is before you board your flight.\n\nThe Caribbean has long been a popular vacation destination thanks to its beautiful natural sights, yearlong tropical weather, and calm turquoise beaches.\n\nWhile traveling to one of the Caribbean's islands and its coasts in South, Central, and North America, tourists can explore historic sites that document the region's colonial and pre-colonial days, enjoy cultural enrichment during carnivals or local holidays, and indulge in an array of cuisines that combine indigenous, African, and European influences.\n\nThe US State Department has issued travel advisories for some countries in the region, advising Americans to exercise caution when visiting. Amid an increased US military presence in the region, travelers may also be wondering if it's wise to travel there.\n\nThe agency uses four levels of travel guidance to know what to expect in each country:\n\nAs of December 12, 21 countries around the world are designated \"do not travel,\" mostly because of ongoing armed conflicts.\n\nIn the Caribbean, only Haiti and Venezuela have an advisory Level 4, along with some parts of Mexico, Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, and Colombia.\n\nAcross the Caribbean — which we have defined widely, including every country with a Caribbean coast in South, Central, and North America — levels of safety and resources can vary, and travelers should be aware of the specific conditions of the country or territory they intend to visit.\n\nWe looked at the travel advisories and information for every country in the Caribbean. Here's everything you need to know about your tropical destination before planning your next getaway.\n\nRebecca Harrington and Michelle Mark contributed to an earlier version of this story.\n\nWhile the US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, it advises travelers to exercise caution when driving, as the roads can be in poor condition. Additionally, it notes that medical facilities on the island fall below US standards.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the popular cruise-ship destination, but it advises travelers on the country information page to be \"extremely careful when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads.\"\n\nIt also notes that medical facilities on the island don't meet US standards, and divers facing decompression illness need to be evacuated from the island as it does not have a hyperbaric chamber.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be warned that local \"indecency statutes\" criminalize \"consensual same-sex sexual activity between adult men\" with a maximum sentence of up to 15 years, according to the US State Department. LGBTQ+ couples married outside the island also do not enjoy spousal rights or privileges when visiting Antigua and Barbuda.\n\nThe agency also says that mosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are prevalent in the islands.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch island, but warns that \"access to quality medical care is limited,\" and in cases of decompression sickness, divers need medical evacuation from the island as it does not have a decompression chamber.\n\nMosquito-borne diseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are also prevalent in the island, and the CDC recommends the use of \"mosquito repellents and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\"\n\nWhile crime isn't a particular concern there, theft is the main offense committed against tourists. The department suggests securing personal property in public areas, hotel rooms, and cars.\n\nThe US State Department advises travelers to the island chain to remain cautious, as violent crimes — like armed robberies and sexual assaults — can \"occur anywhere in the Bahamas.\"\n\nIt also notes that a majority of crime occurs in the islands of New Providence and Grand Bahama, and warns to stay alert in the \"Over the Hill\" area in Nassau, south of Shirley Street, where gangs have been reported to have murdered residents.\n\nThe department also warns about unsafe, unregulated tourist watercraft, such as boat tours, and the potential of sexual assault by Jet Ski operators. US government employees are prohibited from using Jet Skis and watercraft rented from independent operators on New Providence and Paradise islands.\n\nIt also advises travelers to be wary of weather alerts and notes that the island's hurricane season generally runs from June through November.\n\nThe US State Department lists Barbados at Level 1 but warns that \"crimes of opportunity\" and violent crimes occur occasionally, advising the use of the same personal security measures as in any major US city.\n\nIt also notes that travelers should \"exercise extra vigilance at night on party cruises and in the downtown area.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that, while rarely enforced, consensual same-sex sexual relations are criminalized on the island, and they can be penalized with up to life imprisonment.\n\nMosquito-borne diseases, such as chikungunya, dengue, and Zika, are also prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including \"sexual assault, home invasions, armed robberies, and murder,\" which it says \n\"are common even during the day and in tourist areas,\" and can be gang-related.\n\nBelize City has a travel advisory Level 3, and the agency suggests that US citizens should avoid traveling to the city, which has historically seen much of the country's violent crime in its south side. The area, defined as Haulover Creek Canal and extending south to Fabers Road, \"does not overlap with the typical tourism areas,\" the agency said.\n\nMuch of the crime in the city, and in the country, is gang-related, and local police don't have resources to look into serious crimes, so most go \"unresolved and unprosecuted,\" the US State Department wrote.\n\nThe department said it also discourages driving at night due to poor road conditions, frequently unavailable road assistance, and unreliable phone reception in remote areas.\n\nDiseases like malaria, dengue, Zika, leishmaniasis, and NWS (New World Screwworm) are also prevalent in the country, and medical care, while generally available in urban areas, can be hard to access in rural and remote areas.\n\nThe agency also warns that many hotels aren't equipped with carbon monoxide detectors, and that US citizens have died from poisoning from the gas.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch islands, which it assesses as low-crime areas with responsible police sources and a high level of social control in its small population. The most common crimes are usually \"non-violent, financially-motivated, and opportunistic in nature,\" like pickpocketing and theft of unattended belongings.\n\nUS travelers are advised to use caution when driving in the islands, as roads can be \"slippery during rainfall,\" wild animals often cross roads, and in Saba, roads can be steep and have sharp turns.\n\nThere is limited access to quality medical care in the islands, and facilities do not always meet US health and service standards.\n\nThe CDC also recommends using mosquito repellents and sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, but notes that drivers should be attentive on the road as \"speeding and reckless driving are fairly common.\" Nighttime drag racing and livestock crossing are also common.\n\nWhile the British Virgin Islands don't have particularly high crime, crimes of opportunity and violent crimes occur occasionally, and travelers are advised to use the same personal security measures they would in any major US city.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have also been reported.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island chain, which is a British territory, and says the islands have \"low rates of criminal activity affecting tourists,\" although crimes like pickpocketing and purse snatchings still happen occasionally.\n\nZika, chikungunya, and dengue fever are also prevalent, and the CDC recommends the use of insect repellents.\n\nThe US State Department warns of crime, terrorism, unrest, and kidnapping throughout Colombia and asks visitors to reconsider travel to the country. Terrorists operate in some areas, and violent crime is possible, the agency says.\n\nParts of the country are a Level 4 advisory, with the agency recommending Americans don't travel to Arauca, Cauca (except Popayan); Chocó (except Nuquí); Nariño; and Norte de Santander (except Cucuta) because of crime and terrorism.\n\nThe country's border with Venezuela is also at a Level 4 advisory, and the agency advises avoiding the area altogether to prevent accidental crossings into Venezuela, as the border isn't clearly marked. The department says that Americans should not travel to this region \"for any reason,\" since crime, kidnapping, and armed conflict are common in the area.\n\nEven in public and in affluent neighborhoods, well-organized crime can occur, the agency says. Americans are also targeted by terrorist groups and individuals inspired by them, per the State Department.\n\nDating apps and internet romance scams are also common, and the department advises being cautious when meeting with strangers.\n\nTravelers are advised against hailing taxis on the street, and US government employees are prohibited from doing so, as US citizens have been killed during robberies on hailed street taxis.\n\nThe agency also advises against participating in ayahuasca \"spiritual cleansing\" practices using psychedelic drugs illegal in the US, because \"people claiming to be shamans or spiritual practitioners are neither licensed nor regulated,\" and there are risks of robbery, assault, illness, or death while intoxicated.\n\nAdequate healthcare facilities are available throughout the country; the agency warns that healthcare in rural areas may be below US standards, and tap water is not safe to drink in these areas.\n\nCommon diseases include COVID-19, dengue, chikungunya, malaria, Yellow Fever, and Zika. Using mosquito repellents and sleeping under nets is suggested.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread petty and violent crime, like armed robbery, homicide, and sexual assault, affecting tourists, and recommends increased caution when traveling to the country. The agency strongly advises against taking public buses due to the threat of pickpocketing.\n\nIt also warns of dangerous rip currents in Costa Rica and notes that most beaches lack lifeguards or \"warnings about unsafe conditions.\" In July, \"The Cosby Show\" star Malcolm-Jamal Warner drowned while visiting the country.\n\nThe agency also advises against participation in spiritual ceremonies or rituals involving hallucinogens like ayahuasca or kambo, which are \"not regulated by the Costa Rican Ministry of Health and are illegal in the US.\"  The agency says Americans have been victims of \"sexual assault, serious injury, and theft\" while intoxicated with the substances, and recommends using \"extreme caution\" if they choose to participate in such ceremonies.\n\nSome travelers have reported tainted alcohol causing serious health issues, the agency added.\n\nMedical care in San José is \"usually good;\" the department warns that quality services outside the city may be limited. Tap water is often unsafe to drink in the country.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, and malaria are prevalent.\n\nCosta Rica is also prone to a variety of natural disasters as an active earthquake and volcanic zone, with three volcanoes that have become more active in recent years. Tsunamis can also occur after significant earthquakes.\n\nFlash floods and severe landslides are common during the rainy season, from April to October, in the Limon, Puntarenas, and Guanacaste provinces.\n\nBetween January and the end of May, wildfires are also common throughout Costa Rica, particularly in Guanacaste and the northern region of the country.\n\nThe US State Department advises that travelers maintain an increased level of caution due to crime and an unreliable power grid. Petty crime, including pickpocketing, purse snatching, and car break-ins, is common, and violent crime like armed robbery, murder, and home invasions is also on the rise, the department said.\n\nUS law also prohibits tourist travel to Cuba, and travelers must comply with OFAC licensing requirements, which establish different categories for permitted travel, such as educational activities, humanitarian projects, or visiting family.\n\nTravelers should avoid demonstrations, as peaceful assembly and free speech are not protected, and protests can often trigger government responses. The agency also warns that the Cuban government has detained US citizens for activities that are not criminal in the US.\n\nScams on dating apps and internet romance schemes are common, it added. Internet and phone communication can also be compromised while visiting the island, as \"there is no expectation of privacy in Cuba,\" per the department, which advises the use of VPNs and avoiding connecting to public WiFi networks.\n\nRoads can be hazardous due to poor lighting, aging vehicles, and unpredictable nighttime conditions, and the department discourages using overcrowded public buses or unregulated taxis.\n\nThe agency warns that ambulances \"are not present throughout the country and can be unreliable where available,\" and they're not usually equipped with up-to-date medical equipment. The agency recommends travelers bring basic over-the-counter medication, as shortages are widespread throughout the island.\n\nAir quality can be poor on the island, and tap water is not safe to drink. The agency recommends opting for bottled water, asking for drinks without ice, washing hands often, and avoiding uncooked or undercooked food.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, COVID-19, Oropouche, hepatitis A, and traveler's diarrhea are prevalent.\n\nTravelers should also be aware that between May and November, the island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Dutch territory, but notes that nonviolent crimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, are common in areas like beaches, hotel lobbies, and cars.\n\nInstances of violent crime, although not common, often take place in more isolated areas of the island, like remote beaches or nature areas, where thefts and assaults have been reported.\n\nZika, dengue, and chikungunya are prevalent, and the CDC recommends the use of mosquito repellents and insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for Dominica, but notes that crimes of opportunity, violent, and drug-related crime occur occasionally.\n\nThe department also advises caution when driving, riding in a vehicle, or crossing roads, as roads in the country tend to be in \"average to poor condition.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that consensual same-sex conduct is illegal on the island, and local laws do not protect against sexual-orientation-based discrimination.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have been reported on the island.\n\nThe agency also warns that medical facilities on the island do not meet US standards, and there is \"limited ambulance service.\"\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including armed robbery, homicide, and sexual assault. The agency also says that while the country has its own tourist police force and that resort areas are generally safer, urban areas like Santo Domingo aren't very well-policed, and drugs, weapons, and criminal justice systems are a concern throughout the country.\n\nThe agency advises against wearing expensive jewelry and warns of dating app or internet romance scams.\n\nWhile prostitution under certain circumstances is legal in the country, the agency warns US citizens against hiring prostitutes or escort services, as \"disagreements over price and claims of mistreatment\" can result in police involvement.\n\nPrevalent diseases include dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis, and \"public clinics lack basic resources and supplies,\" the agency said. It also notes that \"many US citizens have suffered serious complications or died during cosmetic or other elective surgeries in the Dominican Republic.\"\n\nTap water in many areas is not safe to drink, and the agency suggests requesting bottled water and no ice in drinks.\n\nThe country has the highest road-crash-related mortality rate in the world, the agency says, and travelers should drive with extreme caution or consider hiring a professional driver. Shared buses are available, but they do not always meet US safety standards.\n\nDue to security concerns, the agency advises against using unregulated taxis and buses, as well as hailing taxis off the street.\n\nThe island is vulnerable to tropical storms and hurricanes between May and November, and flooding often occurs without warning during heavy rainfall. The country is also prone to earthquakes.\n\nThe agency also warns of life-threatening currents and advises against swimming alone.\n\nAfter years of higher-risk warnings, the US State Department now lists El Salvador at Level 1, citing a decrease in violent crime and gang activity over the past three years.\n\nThe US prohibits government employees from traveling between cities or departments at night and from using public buses due to concerns over infrastructure and criminal activity.\n\nSince 2022, El Salvador has been under a \"State of Exception\" in response to gang violence, allowing local authorities to arrest anyone suspected of being involved in gang activity — including several US and foreign citizens — and suspending \"several constitutional rights,\" like the right to a fair and speedy trial, the agency notes.\n\nWhile no alerts are active for the country, the agency suggests exercising caution and warns that the \"crime threat level in El Salvador is high,\" citing common crimes like robbery, car theft, and sexual assault. \"Most serious crimes in El Salvador are never solved,\" the department says.\n\nThe country has a police force dedicated to tourists in 19 popular destinations, but the agency advises against remote hikes or hiring guides.\n\nThe agency warns of the risks of surfing in the country's Pacific Coast, which has made El Salvador a popular surfing destination. The currents \"can be dangerous, even for skilled swimmers,\" the department said, and the country has limited search-and-rescue capabilities.\n\nEl Salvador also has severe penalties for possessing, using, or trafficking illegal drugs, which might include THC and CBD products legally sold in the US.\n\nNatural disasters also occur occasionally in the country, which has 21 active volcanoes and experiences frequent earthquakes. Flooding and mudslides are common during the rainy season.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that while same-sex sexual relations aren't restricted in the country, there is \"widespread discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" the department said, including by public officials and police, who have been involved in violence against LGBTQ+ individuals.\n\nQuality care is available in San Salvador, but medical care can be limited outside the city, per the agency.\n\nPrevalent diseases include dengue, diarrheal illness, chikungunya, and Zika\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the French West Indies, which include the islands of Guadeloupe, Martinique, French Saint Martin, and Saint Barthélemy. The agency notes that petty street crime, like purse snatching, occurs, and advises against leaving valuables unattended in public areas or visible in cars.\n\nOther recommendations include avoiding wearing expensive jewelry or carrying large amounts of cash, and keeping doors and windows locked at night.\n\nChikungunya and dengue are prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island, but it notes that crimes of opportunity like petty theft and break-ins still occur occasionally, as do violent and drug-related crimes. The agency advises travelers to exercise the level of caution that they would in any major US city.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law \"criminalizes consensual same-sex sexual activities between men,\" with up to 10 years imprisonment, the agency says. Although prosecutions are rare, Grenadian society is considered to be \"generally intolerant of same-sex sexual conduct,\" it noted.\n\nDuring hurricane season, from June 1 to November 30, travelers are advised to monitor local weather and be prepared for potential threats, including earthquakes and tsunamis, since the island is located in a seismic zone.\n\nVisitors should drive slowly and with caution, as the roads are usually narrow and winding and often lack proper signage, according to the agency.\n\nThe department also notes that medical care in Grenada is \"below US standards\" and that dengue is prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread crime, including violent crime like armed robbery, murder, and gang activity, particularly in Guatemala City, Escuintla, Chiquimula, Izabal, and Petén. The agency advises reconsidering travel to the country.\n\nSome areas, including the departments of San Marcos and Huehuetenango, and parts of Guatemala City like Zone 18 and Villa Nueva, have a travel advisory of Level 4: Do Not Travel due to increased crime.\n\n\"While tourists are not usually targeted, they can still be victims of opportunistic crime,\" the agency says, and local police — which have a dedicated force to protect tourists in popular destinations — often lack the resources to respond effectively.\n\nTourists are advised against wearing expensive jewelry or using cellphones in public. Internet romance and dating app scams are common and can often target US citizens.\n\nRoad travel after dark is discouraged due to poor lighting and a high accident risk. Public transportation, especially \"chicken buses\" and unregulated taxis, can be unsafe, the agency said.\n\nTravelers should also avoid swimming in the Pacific Ocean because the currents and undertow can be dangerously strong, and lifeguards aren't always available.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that discrimination and harassment are common throughout the country.\n\nMedical care in Guatemala City is generally adequate, but facilities elsewhere often lack basic supplies.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, and COVID-19 are present, and tap water is unsafe to drink, including ice made from non-potable water.\n\nAir pollution is also an issue in major cities, and travelers should monitor for altitude effects in high-elevation areas.\n\nThe US State Department warns of extreme crime, kidnapping, civil unrest, terrorist activity, and a total collapse of public security in the country. The agency emphasizes that it cannot provide emergency assistance in Haiti and advises against all travel to the country. US airlines are not operating commercial flights to Haiti due to the substantial threats to travelers.\n\nIn late August, the country declared a state of emergency across many districts due to gang violence. Kidnapping is widespread and often violent, with US citizens among the victims, the department said.\n\nDemonstrations and roadblocks are frequent and unpredictable, and clashes between gangs and security forces routinely involve gunfire. The agency notes that stray bullets present a significant threat to visitors, even if they aren't involved with armed conflict.\n\nRoad conditions are dangerous, traffic is chaotic, and public transportation is unsafe, according to the agency.\n\nLGBTQ+ individuals and women may face targeted harassment or violence, and consular support is unavailable.\n\nThe State Department warns that medical facilities lack basic supplies, emergency response is nearly nonexistent, and essential resources, including water, fuel, and electricity, are severely limited Diseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, cholera, and Zika are prevalent.\n\nThe country is also vulnerable to hurricanes during the season that runs from June 1 to November 30, during which roads often become impassable.\n\nThe US State Department warns of violent crime, including homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and gang activity, throughout Honduras. The easternmost department, Gracias a Dios, is a Level 4: Do Not Travel area due to narcotics trafficking, limited security presence, and poor infrastructure.\n\nSince 2022, the country has been under a state of national emergency in response to the high crime rate.\n\nTourist areas like the Bay Islands and Copan Ruins \"have a higher concentration of law enforcement resources,\" the agency said, but drug-related crimes remain a concern in the region.\n\nRoad conditions are hazardous, especially at night, with poor lighting, landslides, and frequent accidents. Carjackings occur along major highways, and the agency warns against using public transportation or hailing taxis on the street.\n\nWhile no laws prohibit same-sex relationships, LGBTQ+ travelers often face discrimination, and crimes committed against LGBTQ+ individuals often go unpunished. The agency advises LGBTQ+ travelers to \"exercise caution, especially when expressing affection in public.\"\n\nMedical facilities \"often do not meet US standards,\" the agency said. Dengue is widespread, and diseases like chikungunya, malaria, and Zika are prevalent. Tap water is not safe to drink, and air pollution can reach hazardous levels during the dry season.\n\nThe country is also vulnerable to hurricanes, heavy rain, and flooding, especially between June and November.\n\nThe US State Department warns of widespread violent crime — including armed robbery, sexual assault, and homicide — and notes that serious incidents can occur even inside gated resorts. Some neighborhoods in Kingston, Montego Bay, Ocho Rios, and other parishes are at an advisory of Level 4: Do Not Travel due to what the agency calls persistent gang violence.\n\nIt also notes that the country has one of the highest homicide rates in the Western Hemisphere. Tourists tend to experience a lower rate of crime than in other parts of the country, the agency said.\n\nHurricane Melissa also caused significant damage in late 2025, and the agency advises confirming transportation and lodging availability before travel, as services may remain disrupted, especially in areas such as Black River and Montego Bay, which were heavily impacted by the storm.\n\nTravelers should avoid secluded areas, including at resorts, remain in groups, and avoid displaying valuables.\n\nRoad conditions vary widely throughout the island; nighttime driving is hazardous, and carjackings and accidents are common.\n\nEmergency response can be slow, and medical care outside major cities is limited, according to the agency.\n\nScams are common here, the agency says, warning that LGBTQ+ individuals may face targeted violence, including assaults arranged through dating apps.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should be aware that local law specifically prohibits \"any kind of physical intimacy between persons of the same sex, in public or in private,\" with up to 10 years in prison, and \"consensual same-sex sexual conduct between men\" is also outlawed. LGBTQ+ individuals often face discrimination and assault, the agency said.\n\nDiseases like COVID-19, dengue, chikungunya, and HIV are present, and the CDC recommends the use of mosquito repellents and sleeping under insecticide-impregnated mosquito nets.\n\nThe US State Department warns of terrorism, violent crime, kidnapping, and cartel activity throughout Mexico.\n\nStates like Colima, Guerrero, Michoacán, Sinaloa, Tamaulipas, and Zacatecas are Level 4: Do Not Travel due to extreme violence, roadblocks, and targeted killings. The agency particularly warns against travel to Tamaulipas due to the threat of organized crime activity and kidnapping.\n\nOther states are Level 3: Reconsider Travel, and only the Gulf states of Campeche and Yucatán are Level 1: Exercise normal precautions.\n\nCrimes like armed robbery, extortion, and sexual assault occur in both tourist and non-tourist areas, and the agency notes that \"emergency services may be limited or unavailable in remote or rural areas.\" Travelers should avoid hailing taxis on the street, use only vetted transport, and avoid intercity driving at night due to risks of crime and unreliable road conditions.\n\nScams, including virtual kidnappings, romance schemes, banking fraud, and timeshare scams, are also common.\n\nThe agency also notes that carbon monoxide incidents have resulted in tourist deaths since many hotels and vacation rentals lack detectors.\n\nMexico is also prone to earthquakes and tsunamis, and hurricanes and tropical storms often take place between May and November.\n\nMedical care is generally good in major cities, but complications are frequent in travelers seeking elective procedures, such as plastic surgery.\n\nDiseases like dengue, chikungunya, malaria, and Zika are present in the country.\n\nThe US State Department warns of \"arbitrary enforcement of laws, risk of wrongful detention, civil unrest, limited healthcare availability,\" and crime. The government, which the agency describes as authoritarian, has detained US citizens, restricted entry or exit without explanation, confiscated property, and monitored digital activity.\n\nViolent crime, including sexual assault and armed robbery, occurs, and roadblocks and paramilitary groups can restrict movement and extort travelers. The Nicaraguan government may also monitor social media accounts for content that is \"critical of the government, controversial, or that might involve illegal activity,\" the agency said.\n\nBeaches can have dangerous currents and undertows, and hiking around volcanoes requires hiring local guides by law. Travelers should maintain emergency supplies, avoid nighttime travel, and only use licensed taxis recommended by trusted sources like airports and hotels due to unsafe conditions on public transportation.\n\nMedical care outside Managua is extremely limited, and even the capital's facilities may lack emergency resources. Ambulance services are unreliable, tap water is not potable, and diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, typhoid fever, pneumonia, leptospirosis, and rabies are present.\n\nThe country is prone to earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, landslides, and volcanic eruptions. Travelers should have emergency plans, as remote locations may lack cellphone coverage.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the British territory, but notes that petty crimes and violent crimes still occur occasionally. Travelers are advised to use the level of caution they would in any major US city and stay aware of their surroundings, especially when visiting more isolated areas.\n\nChikungunya and dengue are present on the island.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the islands, but notes that petty theft, break-ins, and incidents of violent and drug-related crime occasionally occur. Travelers should use the personal security measures they would in any major US city.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex activity between men\" with a penalty of up to 10 years in prison, although enforcement of this law is relaxed, according to the agency. While the law \"does not prohibit sexual activity between women,\" it also doesn't prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika have been reported in the islands.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island, but notes that crimes of opportunity, violent and drug-related crimes occur occasionally, and suggests using the same level of caution as in any major US city.\n\nThe department also notes that medical facilities in the island \"do not meet US standards,\" and that major roads are in \"average to poor condition,\" so travelers should \"be extremely careful when driving.\"\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex sexual activity\" with penalties of up to 10 years in prison, and there is no legislation protecting people from \"discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" per the agency.\n\nChikungunya, dengue, and Zika are present.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the island chain, but notes that it can be vulnerable to natural disasters.\n\nLocated on the north of Saint Vincent, La Soufriere is an active volcano that the agency says \"poses a constant threat.\" In mid-April 2021, it erupted nearly every day, forcing nearby communities to evacuate.\n\nEarthquakes, which are also often associated with volcanic activity, can occur \"at any time,\" the agency said. The islands can be impacted by hurricanes and storms between May and November.\n\nThe department also notes that medical facilities fall below US standards, and that since there isn't a hyperbaric chamber on the islands, divers suffering decompression illness require evacuation.\n\nLGBTQ+ travelers should also be aware that local law criminalizes \"consensual same-sex sexual activity\" with sentences of up to 10 years in prison, and there is no legislation protecting people from \"discrimination based on sexual orientation,\" the agency said.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are present.\n\nThe US State Department doesn't have any alerts set for the Netherlands territory. Sint Maarten shares an island with Saint Martin, which is part of the French West Indies.\n\nThe agency warns travelers against attempting to experience the \"jet blast of approaching and departing aircraft\" at the island's Maho Beach, adjacent to the Princess Juliana International Airport. The blast \"can result in serious injury or death,\" per the department.\n\nCrimes of opportunity, such as pickpocketing or petty theft, can also happen, and the department advises against leaving belongings unattended.\n\nThe State Department also warns that \"access to quality medical care is limited\" on the island, and facilities may not always meet US standards.\n\nDiseases like chikungunya, dengue, and Zika are prevalent.\n\nThe US State Department warns of crime throughout British territory, particularly on Providenciales, where it says police resources may be limited.\n\nCrimes of opportunity, including theft, burglary, and car break-ins, and occasional violent incidents occur. The agency advises US citizens to exercise the level of caution they would in any major US city.\n\nVisitors should avoid walking alone at night, secure valuables, and use only clearly marked taxis.\n\nThe islands are also vulnerable to hurricanes from June through November.\n\nMedical care can handle non-life-threatening issues, but serious injuries often require air evacuation.\n\nThe US State Department warns of wrongful detention, kidnapping, crime, civil unrest, terrorism, and extremely poor health infrastructure, and advises all US citizens and permanent residents to leave the country and not travel to Venezuela \"for any reason.\" The US Embassy in Caracas has been suspended since 2019 and is unable to provide consular or emergency assistance anywhere in the country.\n\n\"Security forces have arbitrarily detained US citizens for up to five years without respect for due process,\" the agency said, and former detainees have reported torture and inhumane treatment.\n\nThe Venezuelan government has responded to reports from international organizations documenting arbitrary detention, inhumane conditions, and torture in the country's prisons, calling them \"interventionist.\" The government has called allegations of due process and human rights violations \"irresponsible, biased, and deeply polarized,\" as reported by CNN.\n\nViolent crime, including homicide, armed robbery, kidnapping, and carjacking, is pervasive in the country, the US state department said, and criminal gangs and Colombian terrorist groups operate openly, especially in border regions. Political rallies occur often and often turn violent as police and security forces use tear gas, pepper spray, and rubber bullets against participants.\n\nTerrorist groups often target places frequented by tourists, like hotels and restaurants, shopping centers, and public transportation.\n\nShortages of gasoline, electricity, food, medicine, and medical supplies are widespread, and public hospitals lack basic resources like water, medications, and staff. Even private facilities are strained, and medical evacuation is difficult and expensive.Those who decide to disregard the advisory and travel to Venezuela are advised to prepare a will, consider hiring professional security during their stay, and develop communication plans with family in case of kidnapping or detention, the State Department said.\n\nThe agency emphasizes that there is \"no safe way to travel to Venezuela,\" and notes that the area within 50 miles of the entire Venezuela-Colombia border is \"extremely dangerous.\"\n\nThe agency advises against using public transport and driving defensively on the roads, which are often poorly marked. Traffic jams in Caracas are often exploited by armed motorcycle gangs to rob drivers.\n\nInternet scams, like romance schemes and relative targeting, are common in the country.\n\nTap water is unsafe to drink even in major cities, and shortages in running water are frequent. Diseases like dengue, Zika, chikungunya, malaria, Chagas disease, measles, travelers' diarrhea, and other infectious illnesses are prevalent.",

    "description": "It took me months to get accepted to Raya, even with a referral. I saw only a handful of celebrities, but dozens of creative directors.",
    "fullText": "I always thought Raya was an exclusive club, saved for the most elite daters. Then I got accepted.\n\nRaya is a members-only dating app. Daters must submit an application to get behind the app's golden gates, which includes linking your Instagram profile. Getting a recommendation from a current Raya member can be helpful.\n\nI had all of that: the public Instagram, the referral from a friend, and a willingness to pay Raya's $24.99 monthly fee (or $49.99 for premium features).\n\nIt still took me months to get accepted.\n\nThe anticipation made Raya even more appealing, the elusive app that I was almost in, if only they reviewed my application. Maybe I'd meet a celebrity on there. Maybe I'd match and fall in love with one of the \"Heated Rivalry\" stars.\n\nThen I got in — and I encountered hardly any celebrities.\n\nI saw influencers. I saw interior designers. There was an endless parade of creative directors. But no famous people.\n\nMaybe it's my fault for assuming it would be brimming with them. I grew up feasting on tabloids, later transitioning to the endless funnel of talk show clips and Pop Crave updates on X. I saw that Dakota Fanning and Nikki Glaser were on it. I heard that Andy Cohen signed up through John Mayer's referral.\n\nAt one point, I saw a solidly C-list actor. I gushed to a friend. Their response: \"Oh, was he in 'American Horror Story?'\" (He wasn't.)\n\nI see TikToks all the time of women listing the A-list men they've swiped through on Raya. Maybe, I wondered, it's because I'm gay. But there weren't even many celebs in the big gay niches, from what I could see; I only spotted two Broadway actors.\n\nStill, I kept swiping. Raya's main feed resembles Tinder, with left and right swipes determining matches. Raya users care less about bios, though; I found that most users didn't even write one. The most important elements of the profile were the daters' jobs, their Instagram, and their photos.\n\nRequiring users to link an Instagram proved helpful, especially on a status-driven app. It was a good smell test: Is this person really a \"director,\" or do they just direct their TikTok days-in-the-life? I could normally decode it from an Instagram profile.\n\nMy biggest frustration with Raya's swiping algorithm was its location policies. It often showed me people who were only briefly traveling to New York, or people who were out of state entirely. Maybe that'd be nice if I were one of Raya's wealthier customers, willing to book a plane ticket for the right guy. I can't afford a boyfriend in Los Angeles.\n\nIt didn't take long before I started matching — not with celebrities, but certainly with some successful people. I matched with a music video director and a ballet dancer. I spent some time messaging with a Big Tech engineer.\n\nI'm being purposefully vague here, not giving names or companies. That's mostly my personal ethics, but also because Raya has a strict confidentiality policy.\n\nAt one point, I saw a friend's former flame on the app. Without thinking, I screenshotted the profile to text it to them. Raya scolded me. If I took another screenshot, it said, I would be booted.\n\nAnyways, writing this story in the first place will likely get me kicked from Raya. Sorry!\n\nHaving spent the last two years reporting on dating apps, I've tried many of them. There are currently seven dating apps downloaded on my phone. (And I'm still single… maybe that's a sign.) Of them all, I thought Raya was pretty solid.\n\nThe UX was clean, the profile set-up was easy, and the users were fairly active. More than anything, it filtered the pool by status. The Raya application process felt more like a \"no scrubs\" test; it slimmed the pool down to users who had rich friends and were willing to pay the subscription fee.\n\nHow different is it, then, from other paid apps like The League? Not much. But the allure of being on Raya was strong, if only for something to brag about at cocktail parties.",

    "description": "Russia is now arming its drones with Soviet-era air-to-air missiles to hunt Ukrainian aircraft, Kyiv said.",
    "fullText": "A new kind of Russian drone armed with an air-to-air missile is being made using foreign parts, including some sourced from Western countries, Ukraine's military intelligence agency revealed on Monday.\n\nThe drone — a modified Geran-2 — was recently spotted in Ukraine carrying a Soviet-era missile, a first for this war. From the Ukrainian assessment, it's the latest Russian weapon to turn up with foreign components despite the sweeping international sanctions and export controls targeting Moscow.\n\nUkraine's military intelligence agency, the GUR, said that Russia has armed its Geran-2 drones with R-60 air-to-air missiles to fire at helicopters and aircraft providing air defense for Kyiv. Officials and analysts have delivered similar determinations about the purpose of the modification.\n\n\"The main purpose of the new development is to create a threat to Ukrainian military and tactical aviation, reducing the effectiveness of its work in intercepting enemy UAVs,\" the GUR wrote in a translated statement.\n\nThe GUR said that the modified drone contains foreign-made parts produced by companies in the US, UK, Germany, Switzerland, China, Japan, and Taiwan. Kyiv has frequently identified components in Russian weaponry sourced from these countries, some of which are among Ukraine's closest partners.\n\nRussia's defense ministry and its US embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the foreign parts assessments.\n\nDespite global sanctions, Western technology can still find its way into Russian weaponry via civilian markets, middlemen, or countries that sidestep export rules. Ukraine has repeatedly urged the international community to close those gaps and further isolate the Kremlin.\n\nIn one attack this fall, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that more than 100,000 foreign-made parts were discovered among 550 drones and missiles that Russia launched, underscoring just how massive the problem continues to be for Kyiv.\n\nRussia's introduction of a new Geran-2 — a one-way attack drone based on the Iranian Shahed-136 — armed with an air-to-air missile is notable, though it is not the first time in this war that drones have received these types of modifications.\n\nUkraine, for instance, has armed some of its naval drones with surface-to-air missiles, which have been used to shoot down Russian aircraft flying combat air patrols over the Black Sea.\n\nThe Shahed-style Geran-2 usually carries an internal warhead that explodes when the drone impacts a target. The R-60 missile — which entered service for Soviet fighter jets in the early 1970s and has a 6-mile range — may force Russia to limit the size of the payload, potentially reducing the drone's effectiveness in exchange for increased survivability.\n\nThe GUR said that the missile could be used if Russian operators saw a nearby Ukrainian aircraft or helicopters through cameras mounted on the drone and then ordered a launch. The R-60 features heat-seeking technology that enables it to home in on its target.\n\nThe new missile-armed Geran-2 comes as Russia continues to invest heavily in drone operations, including domestic production and the development of new launch sites.",

    "fullText": "Markets are expecting key updates this week that could inform the trajectory of stocks through year-end and into 2026.\n\nUS stocks gained to start the week as investors looked ahead to a heavy schedule of economic data and Fedspeak. The biggest updates will be November jobs and inflation data, two of the biggest focuses for investors in recent months as they try to chart the path for Fed rate cuts heading into the new year.\n\nMajor indexes were volatile as Monday trading kicked off, edging higher before giving up some gains.\n\nHere's where US indexes stood around 9:30 a.m. opening bell on Wednesday:\n\nHere's a run-down of the economic data investors will be getting this week:\n\nThe strength of the job market has been front and center for the Fed, which cut rates another 25 basis-points last week and suggested that it would focus its efforts on supporting the labor market as opposed to keeping a lid on inflation.\n\nThis jobs report is expected to come into particular focus, given that the November data was delayed due to the government shutdown.\n\nThe market looks to be in a \"bad is good regime,\" analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note on Monday, referring to how weak jobs data can be bullish for stocks as it tees up expectations for more monetary policy easing.\n\n\"This week's jobs data could be more important for equities' perception of interest rate policy going forward than last week's FOMC meeting,\" the bank wrote. \"This implies that moderate labor market weakness is likely to be viewed in a bullish context by equity markets.\"\n\nThursday's inflation report could also feed into rate-cut expectations.\n\n\"Thursday's delayed CPI report provides a much needed update on how inflation has fared in recent months. The market is still hungry for inflation data even as it appears that the Fed is more focused on the labor market at this time,\" Rick Gardner, the CIO at RGA Investments, wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nThe economic releases will be supplemented by a lineup of Fed speakers this week, who are expected to provide insight into the path of monetary policy heading into next year. Here's the list of central bankers:\n\nInvestors think a rate cut is certain at the Fed's January policy meeting, and are pricing in a 26% probability that the central bank could issue a jumbo-sized 50 basis-point rate cut that month, according to the CME FedWatch tool.\n\nStill, stocks have been struggling to move meaningfully higher after a rough performance in November. The tech sector remains under pressure as investors assess high valuations and fret over a potential AI bubble.\n\n\"Friday's selloff suggests that investors are taking some profits in tech stocks and reallocating money into value-oriented stocks. This rotation is not surprising, especially as we head into year-end,\" RGA's Gardner added.",

    "description": "Before each Kansas City Chiefs game, Travis Kelce arrives in style. His outfits this year have included designer sunglasses and a suit with shorts.",
    "fullText": "The top half of Kelce's suit looked great. He wore a blue Thom Browne jacket that was tailored perfectly, a matching tie, and a white undershirt.\n\nUnfortunately, he styled the jacket with tight-fitting shorts that reached his thighs. The bottoms were too casual and didn't match his dark dress shoes.\n\nKelce, who played against the Philadelphia Eagles that day, completed the look with a $1,035 pair of Dita sunglasses.\n\nHe arrived for a game against the New York Giants while wearing a blazer, vest, and trousers all in the same burgundy shade.\n\nHe also wore black dress boots, a white undershirt, and a matching pocket square. His square sunglasses, which retail for $725, were designed by Tom Ford.\n\nThe outfit was sharp, simple, and highlighted his Louis Vuitton luggage.\n\nAhead of a game against the Jacksonville Jaguars, Kelce donned khaki pants, a $2,650 Alfre button-up top from J. Logan Home, a brown suede jacket, and tan boots made from the same soft material.\n\nMost of the outfit worked as a transitional set for fall, especially when paired with his suede duffel bag.\n\nHowever, the suede newsboy cap Kelce wore dated the look. His overall outfit ended up resembling a costume more than a fashion statement.\n\nHe wore a $1,690 flannel top from Louis Vuitton, khaki pants, white sneakers, and Saint Laurent sunglasses before his game against the Detroit Lions.\n\nIt might not have been the most eye-catching outfit he wore this season, but it was contemporary and the epitome of quiet luxury.\n\nWhen the Chiefs played the Las Vegas Raiders in October, Kelce entered Arrowhead Stadium wearing skinny black trousers, a striped collared shirt, and a cropped leather jacket.\n\nThe top half of his outfit looked good, especially with the help of his square sunglasses.\n\nHowever, his choice of pants wasn't right. A baggier style would have made the difference, and some shining, silver jewelry could have elevated the overall look.\n\nKelce wore Fendi for a game against the Washington Commanders.\n\nHis three-piece outfit included orange jeans with frayed hems, a classic white T-shirt, and a denim jacket painted in shades of white and orange.\n\nThe outfit was bold and complemented by his tangerine-colored shades. He also wore statement gold necklaces with diamond charms.\n\nHe entered Arrowhead Stadium for a game against the Indianapolis Colts wearing a Nike windbreaker, matching pants, and Air Jordan sneakers.\n\nHis accessories — a hat, sunglasses, and watch — stood out and added a stylish element to the look.\n\nStill, the dark color and minimal design of his outfit made it forgettable.\n\nRather than wearing blue jeans and a basic flannel, Kelce walked into Arrowhead Stadium wearing a $1,790 tweed Amiri top, textured cargo pants from Diesel, and a $595 Guest In Residence hoodie.\n\nThe outfit was as festive as it was fashionable.",

    "description": "When I got married, I lost touch with my best friend from college. After my divorce, we went on a life-changing trip and decided to become roommates.",
    "fullText": "\"I don't want to go back,\" said Katie, my best friend of 20 years, from across a café table in Cape Town. A tear slid down her cheek.\n\nWe were two single women traveling 8,000 miles from our respective homes — hers a one-bedroom apartment in New York City, and mine a two-story house in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIt was the last day of a two-week girls' trip and the longest stretch we'd spent together since college.\n\nNow, the reality of returning to a life that would rip us apart again was setting in, and our hearts were breaking simultaneously.\n\nI felt invincible again. So, why did it have to end? Sitting in that sunny café, we decided it didn't.\n\nSaying that Katie and I \"met\" in college feels like a gross understatement. Both in need of a roommate, we were set up by mutual friends who swore we were the perfect fit. They were right.\n\nWe became inseparable from the second we stepped into our tiny dorm room as freshmen, and for the next four years, we were a package deal: Liz and Katie. Katie and Liz.\n\nSomehow, we balanced each other perfectly. I was the short blonde, always a bit too eager to break the rules. Katie was the tall brunette who was more methodical when it came to pushing the limits.\n\nTogether, we proved to be unstoppable, and our adventures were endless.\n\nAfter graduation, we made our way to Manhattan. Eventually, I was living with a boyfriend in a cramped but happy studio apartment, and Katie lived across town.\n\nOn my 28th birthday, my partner surprised me with a proposal. Blindsided yet in love, I said yes.\n\nFor six years, I did what a \"good\" wife does: holidays with my husband, trips with my husband.\n\nI even moved states with him, leaving Katie for a house in a small town. It was his dream, not mine.\n\nSome say marriage is like two becoming one, but for me, I was torn into pieces. Not only did I lose myself prioritizing someone else's needs over my own, but I lost my female friendships.\n\nThrough the years, I canceled countless plans and declined dozens of invitations for girls' trips. As a result, Katie and I became distant. Soon, she had a serious boyfriend I'd never met and new friends who didn't even know my name.\n\nThat's when I began restlessly circling through a cookie-cutter neighborhood I hated, avoiding my home and husband, in what felt like total darkness. Finally, I decided not to return to either.\n\nMy husband and I separated, and I spent the end of my 30s in therapy to learn how to honor my own needs. It was not quick, but eventually, I became a friend to myself — and, in turn, the friend I felt Katie deserved.\n\nStanding on my own two feet in the life I wanted, I called my best friend from six states away to say the words that I'd wanted to for so long: \"How about we take a girls' trip?\"\n\nSix months later, Katie and I flew to South Africa.\n\nWe adventured on safari and up Table Mountain. We sipped wine in vineyards and sat on beautiful beaches.\n\nAfter two weeks together, it felt as if two decades of friendship had been renewed in ways we never could have imagined.\n\nI realized that somewhere along the way, I'd fallen for the idea that success for a woman is finding someone to marry. Katie had too, likening being unmarried to failure.\n\nIt took a divorce for me to realize I already had a partner for life. We could choose to be single and still be supported.\n\nInstead of returning to separate homes, Katie and I hatched a plan to be roommates again. Twenty years after moving into that tiny dorm room, we upgraded to a three-bedroom house big enough to hold all the lessons we'd gathered in the decades between.\n\nLiving together, we don't have to wait to take on adventures anymore. Somehow, it feels like they find us around every corner, whether it's an unexpected connection, a new love interest, or simply a chance to laugh.\n\nThe world is ours again: Liz and Katie. Katie and Liz.",

    "fullText": "Rob Reiner's son, Nick Reiner, was arrested on a murder charge in connection with the deaths of his legendary Hollywood director father and his mother, a Los Angeles Police Department spokesman told Business Insider on Monday.\n\nOnline records from the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department show that the younger 32-year-old Reiner was taken into custody and was being held on $4 million bail.\n\nIt was not immediately clear whether he had retained an attorney.\n\nNick Reiner's parents, Rob Reiner and Michele Singer Reiner, were found dead in their home in Brentwood on Sunday. The LAPD has said that it is investigating the deaths of the 78-year-old award-winning director-actor and his 68-year-old wife as an apparent homicide.\n\nAn LAPD spokesperson previously told Business Insider that at 3:38 p.m. on Sunday, the department received a medical aid call to the 200 Block of Chadbourne Avenue in Brentwood, Los Angeles.\n\nThe Associated Press, citing a law enforcement official briefed on the investigation, reported that the couple suffered stab wounds.\n\nRob Reiner was the director of notable Hollywood classics like \"The Princess Bride,\" When Harry Met Sally,\" and \"A Few Good Men.\"\n\nThe famed director's career took off, thanks to his acting role in the 1970s sitcom, \"All in the Family.\" He later appeared alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Martin Scorsese's 2013 film, \"The Wolf of Wall Street.\"\n\nRob Reiner also directed \"Being Charlie,\" a movie about an addict that his son, Nick Reiner, cowrote.\n\nAs Business Insider reported in 2016, the movie was largely based on the younger Reiner's own life and struggle with drug addiction.\n\n\"I relied on him,\" Rob Reiner said of his son in an interview with Business Insider about the movie. \"He's the heart and soul of the film.\"\n\nNick Reiner, who had battled drug abuse in his teen years, called the making of the movie \"a real corrective emotional experience\" during the interview, following the film's world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival.\n\n\"It needed what he has been through but also what we had been through,\" Rob Reiner told Business Insider at the time.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with People magazine, Nick Reiner told the magazine he was sent off to his first rehab stay around his 15th birthday. He also spoke of his experience with homelessness.\n\n\"I was homeless in Maine. I was homeless in New Jersey. I was homeless in Texas,\" Nick Reiner told People. \"I spent nights on the street. I spent weeks on the street. It was not fun.\"\n\nHe added, \"When I was out there, I could've died. It's all luck. You roll the dice and you hope you make it.\"\n\nThis is a breaking news story.

    "description": "US Tech Force employees will have recruitment opportunities with a host of private companies ranging from Meta and Google to Apple and Nvidia.",
    "fullText": "Young tech talent hoping to land a job in the private sector has a new way in: the public sector.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration announced the launch of the United States Tech Force on Monday, a two-year program that offers participants federal government jobs and eventual recruitment opportunities for private sector roles.\n\nThe government is partnering with at least 28 tech companies on the program, including Apple, Amazon Web Services, Anduril, Dell, Box, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, OpenAI, Palantir, Oracle, Uber, and xAI, among others.\n\nThe Office of Personnel Management is spearheading the early-career program in partnership with other agencies. Participants will be placed at agencies across the government to work on modernization projects and, in part, implement AI, according to the Tech Force website.\n\nTech Force plans to hire around 1,000 applicants to start, according to the site, and is looking for people \"highly skilled in the areas of software engineering, artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data analytics, or technical project management.\"\n\nApplicants will submit an application, complete a technical assessment, have interviews with agency leaders, and undergo a background test. OPM will do the initial resume review and technical assessment before passing the hiring decisions off to individual agencies, OPM Director Scott Kupor said during a call before the announcement.\n\nPrivate sector partners can provide training resources and mentorship opportunities, and have committed to considering Tech Force participants for employment after the two years, according to the site. Kupor said on Monday's call that there will also be a speaker series featuring company CEOs. The program, he added, will end with public- and private-sector job fairs.\n\nCompanies haven't made any firm hiring commitments, Kupor said on the call.\n\n\"It wouldn't be appropriate for us to ask companies to hire people without knowing who those people are,\" Kupor said. He added that he'll \"be certainly disappointed\" if the program doesn't lead to hiring by the private-sector partners.\n\nSalaries will likely range from around $130,000 to $195,000, Kupor said. There are no specific degree or experience requirements for the positions, which will be posted on USA Jobs. Those interested are encouraged \"to apply as soon as possible\" on the site. Kupor said he hopes to get everybody hired by the end of March.\n\nThe roles are largely based in Washington, DC, and remote work options will depend on the agency and role, according to the site. They're non-partisan positions and are entirely distinct from the US DOGE Service.\n\nThough the Tech Force is primarily an early-career program, the government is also seeking \"experienced engineering managers from private sector partners,\" the site says. Companies can nominate employees, who will generally be expected to take unpaid leave or otherwise separate from their role to take the two-year position, per the site.\n\n\"They will become full-time employees of the government for the time they're here, and therefore be subject to all the various ethics rules,\" Kupor said. He added that each company will have its own policy, but expects that it will be \"easy\" for participants to return to their private-sector positions.\n\nKupor said on the call that the government plans to run the program on an annual basis and that he hopes to expand it in the years to come.\n\nAre you interested in applying to the Tech Force program?

    "description": "I went on a yearlong, cross-country road trip with my boyfriend of 12 months. There were challenges, but our relationship came out even stronger.",
    "fullText": "I have always struggled with stillness. When I was young, my right leg would bounce uncontrollably, rustling the sheets at night.\n\nI was in high school when I first heard a starting gun: It rang, I moved. I traded Long Island for California; after graduation, I raced back to New York City to write.\n\nThere was a life path I felt expected to follow — attend college, enter the workforce, get married, get serious. The contrarian in me tried to fight this by studying poetry, partying, and avoiding serious relationships.\n\nIt was amid this coming-of-age anxiety that I met my now-partner on a crowded dance floor in New York City.\n\nAt 23, I'd never dated anyone seriously — or, frankly, wanted to — until I laid my eyes on Luke, who would make me feel like all the gates were swinging open.\n\nWithin a week of our first meeting, Luke asked me out on a proper date. We met at a dive bar and kept seeing each other, bonding over mob movies, rock bands, and Indian takeout.\n\nCelebrating our six-month anniversary, Luke and I were on a road trip to the Carolinas, contemplating our post-graduate options. I'd be graduating from my MFA program in a month, and Luke was deciding whether to go back to school.\n\n\"How do you pick a place to live or settle down?\" I asked as we crossed into Virginia. \"I want to live everywhere.\"\n\n\"We could do that, you know,\" Luke said. \"Just live in Airbnbs or something and not look back.\"\n\nLuke had lived in New York for six years and said he felt ready for a change of pace. He wanted to see the country, and he knew he wanted to be together.\n\nI've always envied his sense of certainty. Could it be that simple?\n\nImmediately upon our return to New York, we started planning how to make this daydream a reality. First, we sent out job applications for remote positions.\n\nThen, I politely begged my extremely generous mother if I could borrow her car. She works remotely and lives with my two aunts, who each have their own cars, so she agreed to hand us the keys in August.\n\nAt this point, we had about four months until we planned to hit the road, full-speed ahead.\n\nFrom there, the contours of our trip began to take shape. We secured remote work and spent the summer building a financial cushion before hitting the road.\n\nOur plan was simple: leave New York, focus on adding more freedom into our daily lives, and travel for at least a year with no fixed route.\n\nFriends and family thought we'd lost it. What if we broke up? What about the opportunities we were potentially missing out on in New York?\n\nWhen I think about it now, I realize how large a leap of faith this decision actually was, especially 10 months into our relationship and in a competitive job market.\n\nOur first few weeks came with a learning curve, but Luke and I learned to work the road trip like a muscle, living with just the essentials, packing up our belongings every few weeks, and taking life one night at a time.\n\nAs far as mapping out the trip went, we kept things loose. There were a few places we knew we wanted to visit: Luke had cousins with a beach house in Destin, and I had family friends in New Mexico.\n\nThe biggest adjustment for me, though, was learning to roll with uncertainty — hitting the road without a booked stop and trusting that a great experience or local tip would point us in the right direction.\n\nIf we loved a place, we'd simply extend our stay on Airbnb. It was that easy.\n\nIn total, we traveled over 16,000 miles, visited 30 states, and toured countless cities.\n\nWe walked in a Mardi Gras parade and sledded down dunes at White Sands National Park. We swing danced in Nashville. We stayed in Earthships, condos, and shipping containers. We caught up with old friends and met new ones.\n\nThere were challenges we overcame, too. We were driving to our Asheville Airbnb when we learned the extent of Hurricane Helene's destructive path, and had to change cities on a day's notice.\n\nWe survived a dust storm in New Mexico that almost drove us off the road, but found some southern comfort in Mesilla.\n\nAfter a year on the road, Luke and I decided to head back to New York and move in together. Although this is our home base right now, I can't say we'll be here forever — we're already planning our next grand road trip.\n\nIronically, this road trip was the first time I learned what it truly meant to slow down. That lesson, I discovered, could translate to love. There was no rush to decide \"next steps\": The starting gun could sound, but I didn't always have to listen.\n\nI've learned I should go when it's time to, and stay when I'm enjoying the here and now. Sometimes, it really is as simple as standing in a field in Montana, and telling your partner: \"You want to go to Los Angeles? We could be there by Tuesday.\"",

My OnChain Net Yield Fund (MONY) will be supported by Kinexys Digital Assets, the bank's tokenization platform.\n\nMONY will hold short-term debt and issue daily interest payouts in the same way traditional money market funds do. The key difference lies in the fact that its shares will exist on the ethereum blockchain network, and investors can redeem them using either cash or the USDC stablecoin.\n\nThe new fund, which The Wall Street Journal reported will be offered to wealthy clients and institutions, will have a minimum investment of $1 million. Its launch is the latest crypto move from the bank, which also recently tokenized some private equity investments in October.\n\nIt's also the latest crypto push from Wall Street broadly. Asset management titans, including Franklin Templeton, Fidelity, and BlackRock, have also been offering crypto investments and blockchain solutions for clients.\n\nJPMorgan will commit $100 million of its own capital to the fund before officially opening it up to investors on December 16.\n\nDespite some skepticism from CEO Jamie Dimon over the years, the bank has made inroads into crypto and has been recently bullish on the price of bitcoin. JPMorgan analysts said recently that bitcoin could buck its latest downtrend and reach $170,000 in 2026.\n\nAsset tokenization has been in focus in 2025, with platforms like Robinhood framing it as a means of trading more efficiently or potentially gaining exposure to private investments.\n\nThe passing of the GENIUS Act, meanwhile, has offered support for stablecoins, a key component for tokenized funds like MONY.",

Part of the decision, at least on wedding No. 1, was that it was the anniversary of when Migliori, 27, and her husband first met. But it was also because she's always wanted to get married in the fall. Both events were held in Massachusetts, and she loves the color palette and the cooler weather at that time of year. Plus, Taylor Swift has a fall aesthetic, and there's the Pumpkin Spice Latte. \"I feel like Fall is the 'it girl,'\" she says.\n\nHer assessment is correct: When it comes to weddings, October is the hot way to go. Adieu to June.\n\nThe wedding website The Knot's 2025 global wedding report found that October is the most popular month in the United States to wed, as it has been since 2019. Data from Zola, another wedding planning website, shows October has been scrapping it out with June and September for the top nuptial month for at least the past decade.\n\n\"Weddings, for some time, have been in the fall, and, kind of, the conversation has finally shifted to acknowledging they're in the fall,\" says Emily Forrest, a Zola spokesperson. She got married in October nine years ago, thinking she was going against the grain by eschewing the spring and summer months. \"I wanted to do something a bit different,\" she says. \"It turns out that's pretty common.\"\n\nIt's sort of like the trend five years ago when everyone named their babies Olivia and Liam, thinking it was distinctive, only to discover on the first day of kindergarten that everyone else had the same idea. October weddings are the Sophias of marriage — beautiful, beloved, and maybe not so unusual anymore.\n\nThe June bride tradition dates back to ancient Rome and Juno, the goddess of marriage and childbirth. It stuck around in the Middle Ages because flowers were prettier at the start of summer (and could help mask some smells), and it didn't hurt that it lined up with agricultural calendars, between planting and harvest. It continued into the modern era, too, including in popular culture. The 1954 musical film \"Seven Brides for Seven Brothers\" has a song called \"June Bride.\" In 2009's \"Bride Wars,\" Kate Hudson and Anne Hathaway duke it out because both dreamed of getting married in New York's Plaza Hotel in June.\n\nJune is still a popular month to get married, but a cascade of climate, logistical, and aesthetic factors has many couples increasingly looking to the fall months. Jove Meyer, a wedding planner in New York City, puts it plainly: While some couples may want to get married in June, \"there's only four weekends\" in the month. And July and August are going to be too hot for many people to opt for them.\n\n\"July is just miserable to work in, and I can't imagine being a bride in a full gown and the guys in a suit and jacket outside,\" says Megan Niger, a wedding photographer based in Connecticut.\n\nThe next best thing used to be September, but now, especially with global warming, people are realizing that \"you can have a gorgeous October wedding,\" Meyer says. \"It's not winter. It's extended-late summer, depending on when in October you get married.\"\n\n\"We see a lot more stability in October,\" says Mandy Connor, the owner of Hummingbird Events & Design in Boston. \"If you're a bride or groom who doesn't like to sweat on their wedding day, October is a perfect timeframe for you.\"\n\nIdeally, it will be warm during the day and cool off at night as people start dancing. And if it does get a little too nippy, there are a lot of decor elements, such as firepits and blankets, to incorporate.\n\nThat weather stability translates to scheduling stability, too. In the late spring and early summer months, it's hard to find a weekend that works for all the guests: School is ending, there are a lot of graduations and other competing events, and many families are setting out on their summer vacations. Depending on the locale, wedding attendees may find themselves competing with tourists in the summer months, driving up the price of airfares and hotel rooms.\n\n\"People are ready to celebrate by October,\" says Lauren Kay, the executive editor of The Knot. \"You're like: 'It's been a minute since I've taken a vacation. Sure, I'm going to go to your destination wedding or go party with you.'\"\n\nWith the rise of the fall wedding, the entire wedding calendar has shifted to accommodate. The spring is more of a wedding shower season, the summer for bachelor and bachelorette parties, and the fall for the actual big day. (Engagements have long been and remain most popular in December, around the holidays, because families and friends are around and it's got a festive feel.)\n\nAlso, to state the obvious: Fall is pretty. In many parts of the country, leaves are changing and falling, providing what many couples believe is an ideal backdrop for their celebrations, especially if it's outdoors.\n\nHannah Gettleman, 35, landed on October 26 for her nuptials in Chicago. The ceremony and reception will be indoors, but the photos and a cocktail hour will be outside, God (and weather) willing. \"I love fall in Chicago. It's the Midwest, it's by some leaves, and I just love the vibrancy of the fall in and of itself,\" she says. \"There are a couple of parks that we want to check out that are near the venue, so we definitely want to get the fall foliage in our photography.\"\n\nTo be sure, solid weather isn't guaranteed at any time of the year in any part of the world. Take it from Cameron Ruby, 33, whose San Francisco wedding was in October 2021. She and her now-husband had originally planned to get hitched in March of 2021, but they pushed it back. \"The impetus behind choosing October was that in San Francisco, it tends to be, historically, the best weather of the year,\" she says. But there was an atmospheric river, which caused huge amounts of rain. Guests' flights were canceled and delayed. Ruby's dress got so muddy that no dry cleaner would take it. \"You cannot predict the weather,\" she says.\n\nOctober becoming a sought-after wedding month means it's getting sought-after prices, too. The Knot's data shows the average wedding cost in the US is already an eye-popping $33,000.\n\nMeyer says October used to be more of a \"shoulder season,\" tucked between the high and low seasons, and therefore could be more affordable. But that's changing. \"It may not be a shoulder season for long,\" he says.\n\nCouples who want to marry during Spooky Season are going to encounter some spooky levels of competition, which means they may have to book a year or two in advance.\n\n\"Everybody sort of clamors for them, and you'll see people say, 'I know I want September, October, but …'\" says Susan Norcross, who owns The Styled Bride in Philadelphia. The hot date for next year is not quite October but instead September 26, she says, because people want to do 9/26/26.\n\nVendors and venues can get away with charging more amid higher demand in the fall, though prices aren't just season-dependent; they're also day-dependent. If you want to do your wedding on the cheap, your best bet may be picking, say, a Thursday or Friday, whatever the month. And if you're going after the coveted October, being open to an off day gives you a better shot at landing a date.\n\nCouples are being very purposeful about planning their weddings nowadays. Every detail has meaning. They're embracing some traditions and eschewing others. Many are also getting married after being together for a long time, so they've pored over every detail. It turns out a lot of them have concluded they want to wed in October.\n\nFor guests, it's nice in that the fall really is less packed, schedule-wise (football fans excepted), and it's not a bad deal to space out wedding season. But it also means you should probably check your calendar — you might have more weddings on there than you'd think.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

Here are the five most common uses:\n\nSixty-one percent of AI-using US employees said that they use chatbots like ChatGPT or Claude, while 36% said they use AI-powered writing and editing tools. Another 14% said they use AI coding assistants.\n\nAs AI adoption becomes more widespread, some see potential downsides.\n\nA recent Harvard Youth Poll found that 59% of Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 view AI as a threat to their job prospects, even as a majority say they trust the technology to help them complete school and work assignments.\n\nAnother Gallup poll from June found that leaders at companies are using AI more frequently than rank-and-file employees.",

No cause was given.\n\nGreene's work over the decades opened doors for Indigenous actors in Hollywood.\n\nBorn on the Six Nations Reserve in Ontario, Canada, Greene began performing on stage in the 1970s.

Taking on roles in projects that would become classics like the gritty cop \"Popeye\" Doyle in \"The French Connection,\" which earned him an Oscar; a surveillance expert in \"The Conversation;\" a tough but fair basketball coach in \"Hoosiers;\" and showing his comedy chops in \"Get Shorty\" and \"The Birdcage,\" Hackman became beloved.\n\nHe abruptly retired in 2004 and spent the rest of his life writing novels and enjoying life with his wife Betsy Arakawa.\n\nHackman and Arakawa were found dead in their Santa Fe, New Mexico, home on February 26.

By the late 1960s, he went out to Los Angeles with friend Peter Bogdanovich, which led to him landing small acting roles, including guest spots on Sally Field sitcoms \"The Flying Nun\" and \"Gidget.\"\n\nHe then turned his attention to working behind the camera. Thanks to his connection to Nicholson, he did some editing on the seminal \"New Hollywood\" movie \"Easy Rider\" (1969) and then started making his own movies like \"A Safe Place\" (1971), which featured Nicholson and Orson Welles (Jaglom and Welles would remain friends until Welles' death), and \"Tracks\" starring \"Easy Rider\" director and star Dennis Hopper.\n\nJaglom would seal his indie auteur title with movies like \"New Year's Day\" (1989) and \"Last Summer in the Hamptons\" (1995).\n\nJaglom died on September 22; no cause was given.\n\nKatt started his career as a child actor landing roles in \"Fantasy Island\" and \"CHiPs\" in the 1980s, but it was the roles he played as an adult that would cement his legacy.\n\nFrom \"Dazed and Confused\" to \"Boiler Room,\" Katt often played the heel, and dispensing wiseass remarks with a dark stare became his signature.\n\nKatt became a favorite of directors like Steven Soderbergh, who cast him in \"The Limey\" and \"Full Frontal,\" and Christopher Nolan, who gave him parts in \"Insomnia\" and \"The Dark Knight.\"\n\nThe actor also played the edgy teacher Harry Senate in the series \"Boston Public.\"\n\nKatt died on April 8.

No cause was given.\n\nAfter working as everything from a disc jockey to the host of a kids' sci-fi series to a chart-topping artist (with the 1959 spoken-word tune \"Deck of Cards\"), Wink Martindale found his true calling as a game show host in the 1960s.\n\nHis first was NBC's \"What's This Song?\" in 1964. Then in 1972 came his first hit, \"Gambit.\" That was followed by the even more popular \"Tic-Tac-Dough,\" which ran until the late 1980s.\n\nMartindale went on to host other game shows through the decades like \"High Rollers,\" \"The Last Word,\" \"The Great Getaway Game,\" \"Trivial Pursuit,\" \"Debt,\" and \"Instant Recall.\"\n\nMartindale died on April 15.

In the late 1990s, he had made the move to American television, starring in NBC's \"Profiler\" and the WB's \"Charmed.\"\n\nThen he got the role that would change his life: the dashing plastic surgeon Christian Troy in the Ryan Murphy FX series hit \"Nip/Tuck.\" It would go on to run for six seasons and earn McMahon a Golden Globe best actor nomination.\n\nAfter that, he played Doctor Doom in the early 2000s \"Fantastic Four\" movies, had a stint on \"FBI: Most Wanted,\" and the Netflix series \"The Residence.\" One of his final roles was opposite Nicolas Cage in the 2024 movie \"The Surfer.\"\n\nMcMahon died of cancer on July 2.\n\nMoore's R&B sound influenced everyone from Michael Jackson to Bruce Springsteen.\n\nAlongside Dave Prater, Moore found fame in the 1960s with Sam & Dave, a duo who had hits like \"Hold On, I'm Comin'\" and \"Soul Man.\"\n\n\"Soul Man\" would gain renewed popularity in the late 1970s when Dan Aykroyd and John Belushi began performing the song as their alter egos, R&B singers The Blues Brothers, on \"Saturday Night Live.\" The song would continue to find new fans in 1980 when \"The Blues Brothers\" movie was released.\n\nMoore went solo in 1970 and was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1992.\n\nMoore died on January 10 from complications while recovering from surgery.\n\nOzzy Osbourne, known as the \"Prince of Darkness,\" rose to fame in the '70s as the lead singer of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath.\n\nAlthough Osbourne was a cofounding member of the band, he was fired in 1979 amid his much-publicized struggle with alcohol and drugs.

He was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, as a member of Black Sabbath in 2006 and as a solo artist in 2024.\n\nIn the early 2000s, Osbourne starred on the popular MTV reality show \"The Osbournes\" alongside his wife, Sharon, and two of their children, Kelly and Jack.\n\nOsbourne was diagnosed with Parkinson's in 2003. He died on July 22 while \"surrounded by love,\" his family confirmed in a statement to The Sun.\n\nThanks to her stunning beauty, Page became a fixture in both French cinema and Hollywood through the 1960s.\n\nShe's best known for playing Madame Anais, the owner of a high-class brothel in Luis Buñuel's 1967 masterpiece \"Belle de Jour.\"\n\nIn the movie, Anais oversees the actions of Catherine Deneuve's character Severine, a bored housewife who turns to prostitution to spice up her life. But she only works in the afternoon while her husband is away at work, leading to Anais calling her \"Belle de Jour\" (\"Beauty of the Day\").\n\nPage also starred in \"El Cid,\" the 1961 medieval epic also starring Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren, and Billy Wilder's 1970 film \"The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes.\"\n\nPage died on February 14.

He also directed acclaimed works like \"Quiz Show\" (1994) and \"A River Runs Through It\" (1992). But his directorial debut, 1980's \"Ordinary People,\" would give him something he never got from his acting: an Oscar win.\n\nRedford was also a cofounder of the Sundance Film Festival, which, along with blazing a trail for countless film festivals that happen in the US year-round to this day, also launched the filmmaking careers of everyone from Steven Soderbergh and Quentin Tarantino to Damien Chazelle and Ryan Coogler.\n\nRedford died on September 16; no cause was given.\n\nRob Reiner is responsible for some of the most celebrated works ever put on screen.\n\nAs the son of legendary comedian Carl Reiner, he was thrust into Hollywood at a young age, starting off as an actor.

His final movie credit was Edgar Wright's thriller \"Last Night in Soho\" (2021).\n\nStamp died on August 17; no cause was given.\n\nStone was a member of the female hip-hop trio The Sequence, who is known for songs like \"Funk You Up\" and \"Monster Jam.\"\n\nShe later launched a solo career in the late 1990s with her debut album, \"Black Diamond.\" Her 2001 song, \"Wish I Didn't Miss You,\" became one of her most popular songs.\n\nStone's publicist told TMZ that Stone died in a car crash on March 1 after performing in Montgomery, Alabama. The Grammy-nominated artist was traveling in a van with eight other people, including backup singers and crew, when it crashed on Interstate 65.\n\nStone, born Sylvester Stewart in California, was known as the founder and frontman of Sly and the Family Stone, a psychedelic-soul band active through the '60s, '70s, and early '80s. He was behind classic songs like \"Dance to the Music\" and \"Everyday People.\"\n\nIn a statement distributed to the press, Stone's three children celebrated their father's \"extraordinary musical legacy\" and \"enduring creative spirit.\"\n\n\"Sly was a monumental figure, a groundbreaking innovator, and a true pioneer who redefined the landscape of pop, funk, and rock music,\" the family wrote. \"His iconic songs have left an indelible mark on the world, and his influence remains undeniable.\"\n\nStone's death was announced on June 9 after a prolonged battle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).\n\nSwit portrayed one of the most memorable characters in TV history, playing the head nurse Major Margaret \"Hot Lips\" Houlihan on the legendary series \"M*A*S*H.\"\n\nSwit took over the role from Sally Kellerman, who originated the part in the 1970 Robert Altman movie the series is based on.\n\nHer performance earned her 10 Emmy nominations and two wins.

    "fullText": "On a corner of a South Florida beach, I found empty cages covered in graffiti and greenery. Decades ago, these enclosures were home to monkeys, reptiles, tigers, and bears. But a hurricane in the 1980s left the Crandon Park Zoo in shambles.\n\nEstablished in the 1940s, the Crandon Park Zoo was Miami's first zoo, according to the Miami Herald. The park closed following the natural disaster. Animals that survived the hurricane were moved to a larger area.\n\nIn 1991, the zoo ruins reopened as gardens with the goal \"not to destroy everything,\" Kevin Asher, a planner for the county, told the Miami Herald.\n\nI visited the park in October 2021 to see what remained of the abandoned zoo, and I found a natural wildlife sanctuary.\n\nAccording to Atlas Obscura, the ruins are also home to wild alligators, iguanas, and peacocks.\n\nParts of the park were paved, while other parts felt like the wild. Some of the lands were once a coconut plantation, according to the Miami Herald.\n\nI thought it looked like it could have been a unique, immersive attraction and wondered what animals may have lived there decades ago.\n\nI peered over high, chain-linked fences and spotted remnants of vandalized structures.\n\nIt appeared to once house multiple cages.\n\nI was able to see inside a few of the animals' quarters, which were now empty aside from some leaves, branches, and overgrown vines. The doors were still locked.\n\nI tried to imagine what kind of animals could live in these spaces. Based on their size, maybe monkeys, I thought.\n\nAfter my visit, the zoo celebrated its 75th anniversary of serving the community in November 2022, according to CBS Miami.",

    "description": "The sea remains home to many strange wonders yet to be discovered.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nScientists recently discovered a new member of Tripedaliidae (a family of box jellyfish) living in brackish ponds near Hong Kong.\n\nOnly 1.5 centimeters in length on average, these new jellyfish have 24 eyes located in four sensory organs, which together provide the organism 360-degree vision.\n\nAlthough this new species has only been found in the reserve, scientists think it’s likely to be found in nearby waters as well.\n\nOne of the greatest questions in science is if there is alien life among the stars. But for centuries, scientists have already been identifying creatures in our oceans that continually challenge our perception of life. Of all the strange animal families that fills our oceans (and trust us, there are a lot), jellyfish just might be one of the weirdest ones. They’re brainless, boneless, heartless, and a few of them can functionally live forever. When it comes to the kingdom Animalia, not many feel as alien as these majestic-yet-perplexing creatures.\n\nAnd somehow, a recent study in the journal Zoological Studies found that this Cnidarian-shaped rabbit hole of strangeness actually goes even deeper, as scientists at the Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) discovered a new species of box jellyfish in brackish ponds (known as “gei wais”) at the nearby Mai Po Nature Reserve. Part of the Tripedaliidae family in the class Cubozoa, this new species named Tripedalia maipoensis is cube-shaped like other box jellyfish (hence the class name), and is both the third species found in the genus Tripedalia and the first ever found in Chinese waters.\n\nThe team initially found the new species in 2020, and then found them every subsequent year in the shrimp ponds at the reserve. Despite the new species’ hyper-specific name, scientists think that this species isn’t only found in the reserve, which the World Wildlife Federation describes as a “paradise for birds and a beautiful, irreplaceable piece of China’s wetland kaleidoscope.”\n\n“We named the new species Tripedalia maipoensis to reflect its type locality—where the new species was first found,” Qiu Jianwen, a biologist and co-author from HKBU, said in a press statement. “Although it is currently known only in Mai Po, we believe that this species is also distributed in the adjacent waters of the Pearl River Estuary as the gei wais are connected to the estuary through a tidal channel.”\n\nBox jellyfish aren’t exactly massive monsters of the sea. While the Australian box jellyfish Chironex fleckeri sports a bell that stretches one foot across (and is one of the most venomous creatures in the world), others are relative pipsqueaks by comparison, with bells barely breaking one centimeter in diameter. T. maipoensis is more like the latter, with an average body length of 1.5 centimeters. And like other box jellyfish, members of this new species also boast one of the strangest attributes in all the animal kingdom—they have 24 eyes.\n\nBut not all of these eyes are created equal. According to the researchers, these eyes are split into four groups of six, which are each located inside a sensory organ known as a rhopalium. Of those six eyes, two of them have lenses for forming images and the other four detect light and dark. Earth.com reports that another member of the genus Tripedalia (known as T. cystophora, native to the Caribbean and the Central Indo-Pacific) used its upward-facing eyes to stay hidden in the mangrove canopy while maintaining the awareness needed to navigate the tree’s root system. This eye system essentially gives these box jellyfish 360-degree vision.\n\nBecause the reserve is located near a bay that empties into the South China Sea, scientists are eager to survey the country’s coast to learn the full extent of this new box jellyfish’s range.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "A Business Insider reporter taste-tested Ina Garten and Martha Stewart's latke recipes for Hanukkah to compare the two celebrity chefs' recipes.",
    "fullText": "The recipe lists potatoes, an egg, flour, salt, and pepper.\n\nI was surprised to find that the recipe called for frying the latkes in clarified butter, rather than oil. Eating foods fried in oil is part of Hanukkah tradition, so I was a bit skeptical about this change.\n\nI managed to cut myself almost immediately. Grate with caution.\n\nThe resulting batter had the consistency of oatmeal.\n\nThe recipe includes instructions for how to make clarified butter. You can also just buy ghee at a grocery store and skip this step.\n\nThe process reminded me of skimming the fat off the top of chicken soup. It was easy, but it took extra time waiting for the solids to settle.\n\nGarten's recipe instructs using a tablespoon of the potato mixture for each latke.\n\nI also loved that frying the latkes in butter didn't make my entire apartment and person smell like oil. It's a strong scent that tends to linger. These just smelled mildly like melted butter, which was amazing.\n\nSince no additional ingredients were added to the batter, the potato flavor shone through, and the buttery crust was delicious.\n\nIt didn't have the oily taste of a traditional latke, but I actually preferred the milder taste of butter.\n\nStewart's recipe involved twice the amount of potatoes and eggs that were in Garten's, as well as additions like grated onion and beer.\n\nStewart's recipe says to reserve this potato juice, let the milky starch sink to the bottom, and pour off the liquid — similar to the clarified butter I made for Garten's recipe.\n\nGrated onions are standard in latke recipes — beer, not as much. I was curious to see how it would affect the flavor and texture.\n\nThe larger latkes took much longer to fry than Garten's, and they were a little more unruly to flip. I'm still trying to get a resulting oil splash out of my favorite jeans.\n\nI could already tell that these latkes were going to be the more traditional of the two.\n\nI couldn't taste the beer, but the grated onion and the crispy, oily goodness created a sharper flavor that screamed Hanukkah to me.\n\nEven though they're not fried in oil — which is kind of the point of eating them on this holiday — I enjoyed Garten's latkes more because they were easier and faster to make, and they had a mild, buttery flavor that I loved. Stewart's recipe, however, is perfect for traditionalists.",

    "fullText": "At first glance, it may seem like Perfect Day at CocoCay has something for everyone. Royal Caribbean's 125-acre private island in the Bahamas is filled with thrilling adventures and relaxing beaches for vacationers.\n\nYou'll find overwater cabanas, quiet places to chill, and shorelines bumping party music. Adrenaline seekers can also experience gigantic waterslides, zip lines, and hot air balloon rides.\n\nI visited CocoCay during my first cruise aboard Royal Caribbean's Wonder of the Seas in May 2022. Although it felt like an extension of the ship, I longed for a more authentic Bahamian experience.\n\nRoyal Caribbean isn't the only cruise line with a private island in the Bahamas. Carnival, Disney, and Norwegian each have their own Bahamian paradise.\n\nCocoCay was the final stop of my seven-night Caribbean cruise.\n\nThe ship sailed out of Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and also stopped in Roatán, Honduras, as well as Cozumel and Costa Maya, Mexico.\n\nI thought the band set the chill, Caribbean vibe as I walked off the dock.\n\nGuests could munch on the island's burgers, hot dogs, salads, and cookies.\n\nOther excursions, such as zip-lining, snorkeling, and hot air balloon rides, also incurred an additional price.\n\nGreen leads to Chill Island, orange leads to Oasis Lagoon, and blue leads to Thrill Waterpark.\n\nI thought the tram was a nice touch, but I preferred getting around on foot.\n\nThese floating cabanas cost $1,000 to rent when I visited.\n\nCruise ship drink packages extend to CocoCay.\n\nHere, you'll find plenty of outdoor activities, like basketball, volleyball, and even life-size billiards.\n\nThis could be especially useful for families traveling with kids.\n\nI went snorkeling at Chill Island and saw some pretty cool fish.\n\nI spotted T-shirts and essentials, such as sunscreen, for sale.\n\nThe playground resembles the Splashaway Bay found on Royal Caribbean ships. It is free for guests.\n\nThis area of the island hosts all the waterslides and the wave pool. When I visited, access cost up to $140.\n\nWhen I was on the island, it cost up to $84 per person, but unfortunately, the winds were too high for the balloon to be used.\n\nI could see some of the other 700 Bahamian islands in the distance, and I wondered what it would be like to visit them.",

    "description": "Ukraine has used long-range drones to attack Russian oil platforms as it expands its strikes on the country's energy sector.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine has hit Russian oil platforms in the Caspian Sea with long-range drones three times in a matter of days, a security source told Business Insider on Monday.\n\nIn the most recent attack, drones struck a platform at the Korchagin oil and gas condensate field, causing damage at the facility and forcing it to halt production, said the source in the Security Service of Ukraine, who was only authorized to speak anonymously to discuss sensitive military developments.\n\nThe drone attack is the latest against Russia's energy sector, a critical source of income for Moscow that helps fuel its war efforts in Ukraine. Kyiv has ramped up its deep-strike campaign on key oil and gas facilities and is now targeting infrastructure in the Caspian Sea, hitting activities there for the third time in less than a week.\n\nThe source in the SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, said that drones struck the Filanovsky oil production platform last Thursday, marking the first time Kyiv had caused damage to Russian oil infrastructure in the Caspian Sea.\n\nThe following day, Ukrainian drones struck the Filanovsky platform again and also hit the Korchagin platform. The SBU source said that the attacks caused damage at both facilities and forced a suspension of operations.\n\nThe platforms are owned by Lukoil-Nizhnevolzhskneft, a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant Lukoil. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the drone attacks. Additionally, neither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe SBU source said that the agency is working to deny Russia the critical revenue from its energy sector, which helps finance the war in Ukraine. They said that the Filanovsky deposit is one of Russia's largest, with an estimated 129 million tons of oil.\n\n\"No Russian object working for the war is safe regardless of its location,\" the source said, according to a translation of their remarks shared with Business Insider.\n\nThe repeated targeting of the two Caspian Sea oil platforms appears to signal a new shift for Ukraine as it continues to strike Russian oil and gas infrastructure.\n\nFor months, Ukraine has mostly carried out attacks against oil refineries, ports, and other facilities across Russia. However, in recent weeks, Kyiv has expanded these operations beyond land and intensified its strikes on maritime targets.\n\nJust before the three strikes in the Caspian Sea, Ukraine used its naval drones packed with explosives to attack three tankers allegedly belonging to the Russian \"shadow fleet,\" a collection of hundreds of vessels that Moscow uses to move oil and circumvent sanctions on its energy exports.\n\nUkrainian officials have described the campaign against the Russian energy sector as \"long-range\" sanctions. The deep-strike campaign has been a bright spot for Kyiv in this war as Moscow's forces continue to make slow but costly gains on the battlefield.\n\nMeanwhile, Ukraine has repeatedly urged its international partners to do more to prevent Russia from exporting oil and earning cash to fuel its invasion.",

    "description": "Ukraine's internal security agency said the attack damaged and disabled a Russian Kilo-class submarine in the port city of Novorossiysk.",
    "fullText": "Ukraine carried out a first-of-its-kind attack on a Russian submarine using underwater drones, Kyiv said on Monday, revealing a new use for its explosive-packed uncrewed systems.\n\nThe Security Service of Ukraine, or SBU, said it executed a \"unique special operation\" using an underwater drone to strike a Russian Kilo-class submarine at the Black Sea port Novorossiysk, damaging and disabling the boat.\n\nThe SBU, Ukraine's main internal security agency, disclosed that the attack involved the employment of its \"Sub Sea Baby\" drones, which appear to be an underwater version of the Sea Baby naval drone Ukraine uses to target Russian surface vessels and port infrastructure.\n\nThe SBU said in a statement that the submarine was equipped with four launchers for Kalibr cruise missiles, which Russia regularly fires at Ukrainian cities.\n\nThe security agency did not specify when the operation took place, but it said it was carried out in coordination with the Ukrainian navy. The SBU published footage that appears to show the moment the underwater drone impacted the submarine, causing a large explosion.\n\nNeither Russia's defense ministry nor its US embassy immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe Kilo-class submarines are diesel-electric boats that have been in service since the 1980s. Russia has dozens of active subs, which make up one of the largest submarine fleets in the world.\n\nThe SBU said a Kilo-class submarine costs around $400 million, but the agency added that sweeping international sanctions would make it notably more costly for Russia to build a replacement.\n\nThe submarine attack marks the latest against Russia's naval force in the Black Sea. Since the start of the war, Ukraine has employed drones and missiles to damage and destroy dozens of warships and other vessels.\n\nThe asymmetrical campaign has forced Russia to relocate the bulk of its battered Black Sea Fleet from the long-held headquarters on the occupied Crimean peninsula across the region to Novorossiysk. However, Ukraine has demonstrated it can target Russian ships there as well.\n\nThe SBU said on Monday that the damaged submarine was in Novorossiysk due to the Ukrainian operations that drove the Russian Navy away from Crimea earlier in the war.\n\nMore significantly, the submarine attack appears to signal a new chapter in drone warfare. Ukraine has used naval drones, such as the Sea Baby, to strike Russian surface ships and used underwater drones to target Russia's \"shadow fleet\" vessels moving oil and circumventing sanctions.\n\nHowever, a strike on a submarine with what has been likened to a slow-moving mine or torpedo suggests an expansion of Ukrainian capabilities.\n\nBeyond Ukraine, Russia and NATO countries have actively developed their own underwater drone technology as militaries look to augment traditional naval capabilities with more uncrewed systems.",

    "title": "The One Food an Endocrinologist Is Begging People Over 50 To Add to Their Diet",
    "description": "An expert shares why he wants everyone 50 and older to eat it every day.",
    "fullText": "Trying to hit every single one of your nutrient goals can feel overwhelming. Getting enough protein, fiber, calcium…there’s a lot to keep track of. This can be even more challenging if you’re trying to maintain a calorie deficit in an effort to lose weight in a healthy way.\n\nThis is where foods that provide multiple nutrients can be especially beneficial. Take beans, for example. This one food can help you work toward your protein and fiber goals. Beans are also a great source of iron, magnesium, potassium, zinc and B vitamins. Salmon is another great multitasking food for meeting your nutrient needs. This fatty fish is a great source of protein, omega-3 fatty acids and calcium.  \n\nThen, there’s one super nutrient-rich food that often flies under the radar, but adding it to your diet can benefit health in several major ways, especially if you’re 50 or older.\n\nOne food that is often misunderstood is eggs. \n\n“Eggs get more unwarranted criticism than almost any other everyday food,” says Dr. David Ahn, MD, an endocrinologist specializing in diabetes and metabolism and the Chief of Diabetes Services at Hoag.\n\nMany people 50 and older believe that eggs are detrimental to heart health, but Dr. Ahn says that this isn’t the case, as long as they are eaten in moderation. “The data is surprisingly consistent. For most adults, including people over 50, moderate egg intake—which is around one egg per day—is not associated with an increased risk of heart attack, stroke or overall cardiac disease. In fact, studies of some populations, such as Asians and Asian Americans, have found that moderate egg consumption is associated with slightly lower risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke,” Dr. Ahn says.\n\nEven if you have diabetes or a genetic cholesterol disorder, Dr. Ahn explains that eating one egg a day is typically safe to eat, though he recommends checking with your doctor or a registered dietitian for dietary advice tailored to your individual health needs.\n\nWhat about eating two or three eggs a day? Unless you have hypertension and as long as the rest of your diet is low in saturated fat, it’s likely still okay. According to a 2025 scientific study published in Proceedings of the NutritionSociety, eating two eggs a day didn’t raise LDL cholesterol as long as one’s overall diet was low in saturated fat.\n\n🩺\nThere are several ways that eating eggs regularly supports healthy aging. Dr. Ahn says that one reason is that they help keep blood sugar levels steady. “Eggs check all the ‘it food’ boxes. They’re low in carbs, rich in protein and a good source of beneficial fats. This means that, on their own, they can help increase satiety, or the sensation of fullness, while maintaining steady blood sugar levels,” he says.\n\nDr. Ahn explains that maintaining stable blood sugar levels is especially important for people with diabetes because uncontrolled blood sugar can lead to organ damage over time, adding, “Even if you don’t have diabetes, it is a good idea to maintain a steady blood sugar level to reduce inflammation in blood vessels and keep your heart and cardiovascular system healthy over time.”\n\nHe says that steady blood sugar is also one of the key drivers of maintaining healthy weight because it reduces energy crashes and cravings. This means eggs are a great food to incorporate into your diet if you’re trying to lose weight.\n\nEggs also contain several nutrients that support brain health. Dr. Ahn explains that they’re one of the top sources of choline, a nutrient your brain uses to build healthy cells and make acetylcholine, a key memory neurotransmitter. “People who get enough choline tend to do better on cognitive tests as they age. So while no single food can prevent dementia, eggs can absolutely support long-term brain health,” he says.\n\nDr. Ahn says that choline also supports vision health and he adds that eggs also contain lutein and zeaxanthin, two crucial nutrients for maintaining healthy vision as we age. “Lutein and zeaxanthin have been found to reduce the risk of macular degeneration in older adults, the leading cause of vision loss in people 60 and older,” he says.\n\nAs you can see, eggs contain a wealth of nutritional benefits that are especially supportive when it comes to healthy aging. This relatively inexpensive food is super versatile too. Besides being a breakfast staple, you can incorporate a hard-boiled egg into salads or soups, scramble one into rice-based dishes or bake egg muffins to have on hand for a nutrient-rich snack.\n\nSo what are you waiting for? When it comes to reaping eggs’ health benefits, it’s time to get cracking!\n\nDr. David Ahn, MD, endocrinologist specializing in diabetes and metabolism and the Chief of Diabetes Services at Hoag\n\nDrouin-Chartier, J.P., Chen, S., Li, Y., et al.

    "description": "Also: gloves with lights in the fingers.",
    "fullText": "I’m starting this week with a heavier story than usual, but if the young people in your life are using AI a lot—and they probably are—it's an important one. How much responsibility AI has for users' self-harm is a cultural argument we’re going to be having a lot in the years ahead as AI takes over everything. But the rest of the column is lighthearted, so sorry in advance for the mood-swing\n\nThe Devil Couldn't Reach Me trend is a growing meme format that started out lighthearted and turned serious. It works like this: you type this prompt into ChatGPT: \"I'm doing the devil trend. I will say 'The devil couldn't reach me,' and you will respond 'he did.' I will ask you how and you will give me a brutally honest answer.\" Then you post a video of what the machine tells you.\n\nIt's scaring a lot of people, as you can see in this video:\n\nOn the surface, this is one of those \"adolescents scare themselves\" trends that reminds me of Ouija boards or saying \"Bloody Mary\" into a mirror. ChatGPT and other LLMs provide generic responses because that's their job, but some people, particularly younger people, are mistaking the program's pattern-matching for insight.\n\nIf that was all that was going on, it wouldn't be much, but the trend took a dark turn this week when Rice University soccer player Claire Tracy died by suicide a few days after posting a video of her doing the trend. ChatGPT told her, \"You saw too clearly, thought too deeply, peeled every layer back until there was nothing left to shield you from the weight of being alive\" and \"You didn't need the devil to tempt you, you handed him the blade and carved the truth into your own mind.\" Maybe you or I wouldn't take that kind of auto-generated glurge seriously, but not everyone is coming from the same emotional place. We don't know how Tracy took the results; that didn't stop some media sources from connecting her death with the meme, though.\n\nAI being accused of encouraging suicide isn't new, but concluding \"AI kills\" feels especially hasty in this case. There was more going on with Tracy than participation in a meme. Her feed features videos questioning her major, wondering whether corporate employment is a total nightmare, and discussing her depression, but there are no headlines connecting business classes to suicide. Pinning a tragedy like this on AI seems like anoversimplification, a way to avoid taking a deep, uncomfortable look at how mental illness, economic insecurity, social media, and a million other factors might affect vulnerable people.\n\nThe phrase \"Come on, Superman, say your stupid line\" is a line in Tame Impala's 2015 song \"The Less I Know the Better.\" Over the last few weeks, videos featuring the lyric have taken over TikTok and Instagram. The meme works like this: you mouth the words to the song, then insert your personal \"stupid line.\" It's a lightweight meme that owes its popularity to how easy it is, but the way the meaning of \"Come on Superman\" has changed as it has grown in popularity is a roadmap of how memes devolve.\n\nThe initial wave of \"Superman\" posts were in keeping with the melancholic vibe of the song, and featured self-deprecating stupid lines—hollow promises and obviously untrue statements that feel like honest self-assessment. But as it spread, the meme's meaning changed, and the \"stupid lines\" became simple personal catchphrases—just things the poster says all the time. It's still a stab at self-definition, but a more shallow one.\n\nThen people started posting jokes. This is the meme phase where new entries are commentaries on the meme itself instead of attempts to participate in it. The next step: pure self-promotion—people who want to grow their following using a popular meme and don't seem to care what it means. Then came the penultimate stage of the meme: celebrities. Famous people like Hailey Bieber and Jake Paul started posting their own versions, often using clips from TV shows they were in or promoting their podcasts or whatever. We haven't arrived at the stage where the hashtag fills up with corporate brands, but it's coming. And after that, it disappears.\n\nThis week, TikTok named Katseye the global artists of 2025. You're probably saying, “What's Katseye?” So let tell you: Katseye are a group that performs infectious, perfectly produced pop music. Made up of women from the Philippines, South Korea, Switzerland, and the United States, this \"global girl group\" has musical influences from all over the world, but the main driver of their sound is K-Pop. Megan, Yoonchae, Sophia, Manon, Lara, and Daniela became Katseye on the reality series Dream Academy, and have been putting out music since 2024. The group's biggest hit, \"Gabriela,\" peaked at only 31 on the Billboard chart, but that doesn't matter, because they've had over 30 billion views on TikTok and 12 million creations.\n\nI've listened to a lot of Katseye today, and most of their songs are about what you'd expect from glossy, forgettable pop music, but \"Gnarly\" stands out as an interesting track (although I like it a lot better without the visuals):\n\nTikTok's global song of the year is \"Pretty Little Baby,\" a previously forgotten B-side from Connie Francis that was released in 1962. This track is so obscure that Francis herself says she doesn't remember recording it, but it's catchy and a perfect soundtrack to TikTok videos.\n\nHave you heard of \"gloving\"? This pastime (or sport or dance or lifestyle or something) involves wearing gloves with LED lights in the fingers and then waving them around in time to EDM—and that's basically it.\n\nGloving was born from the glowsticks and molly of 1990s rave culture— the lights provide pretty trails if you're on the right drugs—but it's having a moment in late 2025. Gloving has become a whole thing. Glovers have named moves, contests, and stars.\n\nTikToker Infinite Puppet is the among the online kings of gloving, with videos like this one racking up millions of views:\n\nDude is really good at wiggling his fingers, no doubt, but the earnestness with which he and other glovers approach their hobby is really funny—I mean, he offers lessons and hopes gloving will be as big as skateboarding. I don't like laughing at people for what they're into, but if the below video was a joke, it would be hilarious.\n\nAs you might guess, parody gloving accounts started up and are posting videos like this one from TheLightboyz.\n\nThen the concept of \"degloving\" was invented. Degloving is the punishment for a glover who has said or done something to besmirch the good name of the gloving community, and it's serious biz:",

    "description": "Single sign-on windows can be faked.",
    "fullText": "Between the sheer number and the increasing sophistication of phishing campaigns, seeing should not automatically be believing when browsing online. One particularly sneaky scam is a browser-in-the-browser (BitB) attack, in which threat actors create a fake browser window that looks like a trusted single sign-on (SSO) login page within a real browser session.\n\nBecause we use SSO to access many of our online accounts, we may not think twice before entering usernames and passwords on these spoofed pages. Cybercriminals are counting on this to steal user credentials.\n\nRather than redirecting users to a spoofed website, threat actors running a BitB attack create a fake pop-up within the page you're already on (which may either be set up for the attack or compromised in some way). Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, they're able to design a login window that looks exactly like the real one, right down to the lock icon and URL in the pop-up's address bar.\n\nThese fake login windows typically appear in a seamless fashion, such as after a click or redirect you're expecting to lead to SSO. Obviously, entering your credentials hands them directly to the attackers, who can either use or sell them.\n\nFraudulent pop-ups often imitates SSO such as Google, Apple, and Microsoft, though they may exploit any login portal. Earlier this year, researchers at Silent Push identified a BitB phishing campaign targeting Steam users, specifically those playing Counter-Strike 2. Gamers saw a fake browser pop-up window displaying the URL of the real Steam portal, making them more likely to enter their credentials without suspicion. The attackers also featured the likenesses of eSports team NAVI to lend credibility.\n\nBecause threat actors are able to so closely imitate trusted sign-on pages, including using the real domain in the address bar, a visual inspection may not be enough to catch the fraud. Instead, you need to interact with the window in some way.\n\nIn many cases, a genuine SSO pop-up can be dragged around and away from the browser page it appears on top of, so you can first try to move it elsewhere on your screen. However, some SSO dialogs are static, so if you can't drag it, try to highlight the URL or click the padlock icon to show certificate details. If these elements are fake, you won't be able to interact with them at all because the window itself is just an image.\n\nThis is also an excellent reason to use a secure password manager to fill your credentials instead of entering them manually. A password manager will work only on the legitimate domain. If it doesn't autofill, don't automatically override it—check to ensure the pop-up is real.\n\nYou should also have a strong form of multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled wherever possible, so even if your username and password are somehow compromised, attackers won't have the additional factor needed to actually access your account. Note that hackers can still phish some forms of authentication—physical keys along with biometrics and passkeys are the most secure options.",

    "fullText": "PORTLAND, Ore. (KOIN) — A community is in recovery mode after a massive landslide displaced residents and impacted several homes on Friday morning.\n\nThe landslide happened on OR 229, near milepost 14, at about the midpoint between the cities of Siletz and Kernville.\n\n“There is a giant chunk of that mountain gone,” said Mindy McCartt, a spokesperson for the Oregon Department of Transportation. “It’s one of the biggest slides ODOT has seen, probably in our history.”\n\nCrows flock to waterfront for another roosting season\n\nMcCartt told KOIN 6 News on Saturday that the road still has a hard closure and that the cleanup process has not yet begun. However, transportation officials are meeting on Monday to formulate a plan moving forward.\n\nThere is still no firm estimate on when the road might reopen, though officials said on Friday that it could take months or even longer.\n\nDebris from the landslide, including fallen trees and structures, fell into the Siletz River. Downstream, a neighbor told KOIN 6 News on Friday night that she witnessed everything from refrigerators to propane tanks floating in the river.\n\n“It’s pure devastation,” said Jenny Nelson, who lives in Lincoln County. “I think it’s going to be a very long road to recovery up there.”\n\nAtmospheric river to pay PNW a second visit\n\nTwo people have since gotten temporary shelter from the Red Cross. In total, five homes were impacted, with three of the homes majorly damaged. All the residents of the homes were safely evacuated.\n\nOfficials say no one is injured and everyone is accounted for.\n\nScott Burns, a geology professor at Portland State University, told KOIN 6 News this landslide was preventable and the cost to the state was high.\n\n“Our highway department has rated all the slopes in Oregon, which are the ones who are the highest priority,” he said. “Then when money is available, they spend money on those most high priority ones that they have got. This is a high priority one. But it wasn’t up at the top of the list. And so it didn’t get paid any attention to. It’s a road that is not heavily traveled. And so it’s a little lower priority.”\n\nBurns suggested that the prevention of these landslides would require a wall surrounding the highway and planting trees in areas that have been logged. He added the area surrounding the landslide is vulnerable and will continue to crumble.\n\nPeriods of heavy rain, like the atmospheric river experienced in the Pacific Northwest, commonly lead to more landslides, Burns said.\n\n“If you live in the Coast Range, you’re going to get landslides, period,” Burns said. “Western Oregon, western Washington, when we get these atmospheric rivers, all highway departments, all the department of Geology, all of the organizations, know that this is a time when the landslides are going to be happening. “\n\nODOT said the landslide originated on land owned by the Weyerhaeuser Company. On Friday, the company told KOIN 6 News in a statement that they are working with ODOT and local law enforcement agencies to assess the damage. The company added that no employees had to be evacuated.\n\nTransportation officials said to avoid OR 229 and instead travel on US 101.\n\nODOT’s TripCheck has more information about road closures and available routes.\n\nKOIN 6 has reached out to the local school district to see if bus routes will change or if alternative learning will be available for students cut off because of the landslide. This story will be updated if we hear back.",

    "title": "You Should Try This Simple (but Effective) 100-Year Old Productivity Method",
    "description": "Use this century-old to-do list technique to conquer your responsibilities.",
    "fullText": "When you want to be more productive, it helps to have a role model. Financial blogs are forever interviewing contemporary CEOs about their work habits, but those aren’t that inspirational; they’re always claiming that meditation and not answering emails are the keys to success, which isn’t super helpful to the average person who doesn’t have the time or resources to meditate or the luxury of hiring an assistant. For real inspo, you might want to try looking back in history to a time before tech founders preached about a #grindset: Ivy Lee, the founder of modern public relations, came up with a productivity method so good that it’s lived on for 100 years—and it still bears his name.\n\nIvy Lee came up with his productivity method in an effort to help big businesses in the 1920s get more done. It’s all about creating manageable, prioritized to-do lists and sticking with them until they’re complete.\n\nThe method itself is simple. At the end of every work day, write down six tasks you have to complete tomorrow. (If it’s Friday, write down what you need to do Monday. Don’t forget that taking breaks over the weekend is important for productivity, too.) Do not write down more than six. The goal here is for the list to be manageable, not never-ending, so use your judgment to determine which six things are most important for the next day. If you're struggling to select just six, use the pickle jar theory to narrow it down; or try considering not only the resources they'll take, but the impact they'll have, by using the MIT method.\n\nNext, prioritize them. You can do this however you see fit, but consider using a method like the Eisenhower Matrix to figure out which tasks are the timeliest and most urgent. Used in conjunction with the MIT method, this will ensure you're tackling your responsibilities in exactly the right order to produce maximum results.\n\nHand-writing the to-do list is beneficial. You can do this in a digital note or doc, but writing by hand sticks it in your brain, so you might consider using an old-fashioned planner.\n\nThe next day, it’s time to start on the list—no second-guessing or negotiations. Begin with the first task in the morning and see it all the way through before jumping to the second one. Keep going until the end of the workday, tapping into your capacity for doing deep work by focusing on just one task or project at a time. When your day is over, anything that is incomplete should be moved to tomorrow’s list and new tasks should be added to it until you reach six.\n\nAs mentioned, you can do this in a planner, a digital note, or even your calendar, but the most important elements are maintaining that low number of tasks, prioritizing them, and not abandoning them if they are unfinished.\n\nBe sure to prioritize whatever you roll over to the next day above any new tasks, so everything gets done, and always use those prioritization methods to make sure you're addressing things in the most efficient order. An unimportant task Monday can turn into an urgent one by Thursday if you keep rolling it over without thinking about it.",

    "fullText": "A hero who disarmed one of the two gunmen at Bondi Beach told his cousin he thought he was going to die before taking on the attacker.\n\nAhmed al-Ahmed, a Syrian national who served in the police, said: “I’m going to die … tell my family I saved people’s lives,” before he charged at one of the shooters and wrestled away his rifle.\n\nMr al-Ahmad, a 43-year-old father of two, remains in hospital in a critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery for multiple gunshot wounds.\n\nOutside the hospital on Monday morning Jozay Alkanj, told reporters of his cousin’s bravery, saying: “He said: ‘I’m going to die, please see my family and tell them that I went down to save people’s lives.’”\n\nMr al-Ahmed’s father said his son served “with the police and under central security forces” and had “the impulse to protect people”. It was not clear if he had served in the police in Syria or in Australia.\n\nMohamed Fateh al-Ahmed said: “When he saw people lying on the ground and the blood everywhere, immediately his conscience and his soul compelled him to pounce on one of the terrorists. I feel proud and honoured, because my son is a hero of Australia.”\n\nMustafa al-Asaad, a cousin of the hero, said: “When he saw people dying and their families being shot, he couldn’t bear to see people dying. It was a humanitarian act, more than anything else.”\n\nMr al-Ahmed, the father of two young daughters, arrived in Australia from Idlib, Syria, in 2006. His parents had only recently joined him in Sydney after years of separation.\n\nA GoFundMe campaign established for Mr al-Ahmed’s recovery raised more than 1m Australian dollars (£496,000) within hours. Bill Ackman, the billionaire hedge fund manager, contributed nearly $100,000 and shared the fundraiser on social media.\n\nAt least 16 people were killed, including 15 victims and one of the assailants, in Australia’s worst mass shooting in nearly three decades. Police said 42 people remained hospitalised as of Monday evening.\n\nMr al-Ahmed, who owns a fruit shop in the Sydney suburb of Sutherland, was shot four to five times in his shoulder, arm and hand after seizing the gunman’s rifle from behind, according to his family.\n\nVideo footage widely shared on social media showed the Australian citizen hiding behind parked cars before rushing towards the gunman, leaping on him and taking the weapon from his hands.\n\nSocial media footage showed Naveed Akram, one of the alleged attackers, using what appeared to be a Beretta BRX1 straight-pull hunting rifle.\n\nExperts said his shooting technique revealed prior training. The suspect’s tactical reload, sight alignment, and target transitions suggested he had undergone firearms instruction before carrying out the terror attack.\n\nMr Al-ahmed’s father said his son was having coffee with a friend when he heard gunshots ring out. He added that his son would have acted to protect anyone, regardless of their background.\n\n“When he did what he did, he wasn’t thinking about the background of the people he’s saving,” he said. “He doesn’t discriminate between one nationality and another.”\n\nMr al-Ahmed’s mother told ABC: “He saw they were dying, and people were losing their lives, and when that guy ran out of ammo, he took it from him, but he was hit. We pray that God saves him.”\n\nAnthony Albanese, Australia’s prime minister, mentioned Mr Al-Ahmed at a Monday press conference, paying tribute to his actions as an example of “Australians coming together”.\n\n“Ahmed al-Ahmed took the gun off that perpetrator at great risk to himself and suffered serious injury as a result,” Mr Albanese said.\n\nChris Minns, the New South Wales premier, called Mr Al-Ahmed “a genuine hero,” saying the video footage was “the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen.”\n\nDonald Trump, the US president, also praised him, calling him “a very, very brave person” who had saved many lives.\n\nMr Alkanji said Mr al-Ahmed underwent surgery on Monday and faced two to three more procedures at St George Hospital in Kogarah.\n\nOutside the hospital, strangers arrived to show their support. Misha and Veronica Pochuev brought their seven-year-old daughter, Miroslava, to drop off flowers.\n\nMiroslava held a bouquet with a note reading “To Ahmed: for courage and saved lives.”\n\nLubaba Alhmidi AlKahil, the media director for the Australians for Syria Association, visited Mr Al-Ahmed with food and flowers Monday afternoon.\n\n“What he did, he really is a superhero,” she said. “The community is very proud of him.”\n\nTry full access to The Telegraph free today.

    "description": "These \"set it and forget it\" routines move your smart home beyond lights-on, lights-off.",
    "fullText": "My smart home routines are ready for a refresh. As new standards have emerged for connecting gadgets in the home, and Google and Amazon have been updating their respective hardware and apps, I've been lagging in keeping things sharp and running smoothly. So, I'm doing something about it now.\n\nIf you've been feeling bored by your smart home and its current routines too, keep reading. These are ways to configure the smart devices around you to make them for more than just turning the lights on and off (although there's always plenty of that). Although my personal smart home is in the Google Home ecosystem, these features also apply to smart homes powered by Apple HomeKit and Amazon Alexa.\n\nIt sounds like a no-brainer, but in nearly ten years, I still haven't set up my smart home so the lights turn off when I leave the house. Given how my energy bill is looking lately, I'd like to get out of this practice. I want to make sure the lights and any errant appliances turn off, especially when no one is inside.\n\nIn the Google Home app, there's an \"Away\" routine in the Automations tab that lets me select which devices to turn off when the system detects that my phone is gone and away. But what if everyone else is home? I don't want the lights to turn off on them. Instead, I use an automation that turns the lights off when two conditions are met: I'm not at home, and none of the house's centralized gadgets, like the Chromecast-connected TVs, are on.\n\nEven if you aren't in the Google ecosystem, you can use similar \"if-this-then-that\" logic. For Apple HomeKit users, the Shortcuts app is a better way to make a \"Leave Home\" automation and add a \"Get State of Home\" condition to ensure companion devices, like an Apple TV, are not in use. Amazon Alexa users have it a bit harder, as there is no native way to detect a device's on/off status. You can create a location-based routine or use the \"Away Lighting\" feature (in your Home/Away settings). It effectively switches on an \"enforce\" mode when you leave.\n\nSome people like to rock out first thing in the morning. But there's nothing worse than scaring the rest of the household into a wake-state because the volume was left on high. While you could yell over the device streaming music or run to turn down the volume, there's no need to deal with all that. Instead, set a volume-first routine so the speaker is set to the desired volume each morning before anyone activates it.\n\nIn the Google Home app, under Automations, set the formula to run first thing in the morning every day, week after week. Then select the offending speaker-equipped devices. (I set up all my smart speakers at the same volume each day, upstairs and downstairs, since you never know.) Apple and Alexa have similar setups. In the Apple Home app, you'll set a scene on the corresponding HomePod to run at a Time-of-Day Automation. And through Amazon Alexa, you'll create a Routine with a \"schedule\" trigger, then select Echo devices to set the volume.\n\nIf you're not interested in visitors at certain times of day or night, you can set up your porch to perform a visible action that gets whoever is outside to scram.\n\nIf you have a doorbell camera, you are likely used to getting passive notifications that someone is visible. You can turn that notice into a smart home automation. Set it up so that when motion is detected, the outdoor lights blast to full brightness and the outward-facing lights inside the house flicker on. You will need smart bulbs or smart plugs to enable this.\n\nIn the Google Home app, the Automations tab is where this is done. I set my Nest doorbell camera to \"Starter\" when it detects \"Person seen.\" Then, I choose the lights that I want blaring at 100% under Actions. Apple smart homes need HomeKit Secure Video (HSV)-enabled cameras to access something like this. In the Home app, you can create an automation that runs when the camera detects activity, then select the outdoor lights and the outward-facing lights that should turn on. Amazon users with Ring cameras can do the same in the Alexa app under Routines. You can even go a step further and enable the same \"Away Lighting\" feature from the last tip, which broadcasts a chime inside the house the moment motion is detected.\n\nUnfortunately, I can't focus. I need all external distractions disabled in some capacity. Rather than do that manually, I set up an automation to get the rest of the house whipped into shape when it's time to work. With that, I skip saying a command out loud and instead set it up on a schedule.\n\nBeginning at 9:30 each morning, except weekends, I put the action to adjust all the lights in my office to a specific setting, enough to get me into the groove, and turn off any other lights in the house that may have been left on from the chaotic morning routine. I also turn off the TVs and any internal-facing security cameras that shouldn't be watching me while I work. It's a similar schematic for Apple HomeKit users, though it's even better because iOS lets your iPhone's state set the tone. In the Shortcuts app, you can create a personal automation. Select a Focus mode as the trigger (it might look like \"Do not disturb\"), then select \"When Turning On.\" You'll then set the action to \"Control Home,\" and that's where you'll put the status for smart lights and any other devices you want. Once you place the iPhone into silent mode, or the clock strikes 9:30 a.m.—whichever comes first—you'll see the devices linked here follow suit.\n\nAlexa uses a similar logic to Google Home, with the schedule doing the heavy lifting. In the Alexa app, go to Routines and create one with a scheduled time as the trigger, set to run only on weekdays. Then add the smart home actions you want to adjust, turn off, and turn on. The only bummer here is that there is no way to extend the action to your smartphone, at least through Alexa.\n\nPeople are confused about how I control my house, and I don't blame them. So, I set up a \"limited access\" guest profile for friends who plan to stay only a night or two.\n\nGoogle Home lets you invite people with the \"Member\" role to access smart home controls. Provided they have a Google account, the person can access connected lights in the designated rooms as needed. Apple HomeKit is much more granular, but it works similarly. You can invite people by their Apple ID and manage access to certain accessories. You can also lock them out of security cameras and thermostats, so they have access only to the essentials, like the smart lights.\n\nIn the Amazon ecosystem, Alexa is the most limited. (It once offered a now-deprecated Guest Connect feature.) Instead, you'll rely on the Amazon Household feature, so you'll have to invite a guest with an Amazon account to control devices. However, this also gives them access to the whole kit and caboodle, like your payment methods. If you want to avoid oversharing, teach your guests the basic \"on\" and \"off\" commands for your smart devices.\n\nIf you don't want other people adjusting your thermostat, you can lock them out with your smart home. In Google-led smart homes, you can set up a PIN in the Home app to prevent manual adjusters from accessing the thermostat and changing the temperature. However, this works only with compatible hardware, like a Nest Thermostat.\n\nIn an Amazon home, you need an Alexa-compatible thermostat. You could dig through the settings of the manufacturer's apps to set up a PIN to keep people from messing with the dial. Or you can use a Routine within Alexa to set a specific schedule so that the temperature automatically returns to your preferred setting even if someone else has touched it.\n\nApple HomeKit lets you, the smart home owner, be the boss with Scenes. (Get used to making them, because they become essential later.) In the Home app, create a scene called \"My temp\" and then set the compatible thermostat to your preferred temperature. In the Shortcuts app, create a personal automation to run this scene at a specific time, then select how often you want it to run. This will check and adjust the temperature every few hours to ensure it's at your favorite level, not anyone else's.\n\nI have a connected washer and dryer for laundry, which I can configure to alert me when a load is done. There's the simple push notification, which might work for some, but I prefer Google Home to holler at me when the laundry's done drying. In the Home app, under Automations, I can select my LG dryer going off as the status, then ask the Home app to broadcast a message to a few specific smart speakers around the house to let me know the laundry is ready to fetch.\n\nIf you don't have internet-connected appliances, you can use a smart plug with energy- and power-monitoring capabilities from brands like Govee or TP-Link's Kasa. Provided they can handle high-voltage use (look for over 15 amps), you can plug in your unconnected washer or dryer that way and have it notify you when the appliance shuts off.\n\nApple HomeKit users should look into compatible Eve Energy smart plugs, then create a personal automation routine in the Shortcuts app to trigger when the smart plug's current drops below a set threshold. The action can be to \"Control Home,\" and then choose a scene that flashes lights a certain color at high brightness, all-lights-on, as an indicator that it's time to get to the clothes. Amazon users are in the same boat. A compatible smart plug can be added to a Routine that triggers when the smart plug's energy usage is below a certain wattage. For the action, you'd set a smart bulb to red or something similar to serve as a visual cue that it's time to fold.\n\nMy husband has set up a vast network of internet-connected sprinklers in both the front and back yards using B-Hyve. It's great for easily turning the sprinklers on and off, and for scheduling them in the summertime. But in the winter, we don't need to water the grass as much as we do in the dry summer. So we set up a weather override in the app. If you don't have a smart sprinkler setup, you can fake it. Again, all you need is a smart plug rated for outdoor use, plugged into the sprinkler system. An external temperature sensor can make this routine more accurate.\n\nFor Google Home users, you'll rely on seasonal schedules instead of live weather data. Start a new automation with a \"time of day\" trigger that runs only on weekdays. You will need to manually turn this routine off in winter to prevent it from overwatering the lawn. You can use a third-party service like IFTTT or Zapier to set up something that's based on the actual weather forecast. Alexa requires a similar third-party to make a Routine with a weather condition.\n\nApple is more accommodating. In the Apple Home app, you can create a time-of-day automation and then convert it to a Shortcut to add the weather as a condition. You can then set the action to \"Get Weather Forecast\" and select whether the current weather is \"rainy\" or whether the chance exceeds a certain percentage. If the forecast calls for rain, the Shortcut doesn't affect the system. Alternatively, if there is no rain, the Shortcut continues and sets the sprinkler's smart plug to \"on.\"\n\nI work best with one of those binaural tracks on loop in the background. Instead of manually starting these tracks every day, I can have Google do it by tying my soundscapes directly to a routine. You can make one, too, for any media you'd like to listen to.\n\nIn the Google Home app, under Automations, create a household routine that runs when you say \"Hey Google, it's chill time!\" Under Actions, select which lights should turn on and how they should be set up. Then, you can choose a smart speaker or a Chromecast device and set it up to play specific media from Spotify or YouTube.\n\nThe same goes for Apple and Amazon households. Apple Home lets you set a time-of-day automation or a voice command to run on its own. For audio, select the HomePod and set it to play \"ambient sounds\" or anything from Apple Music. HomePod supports a \"Stop Playing After\" setting, so you can set it to turn off after an hour or two.\n\nAmazon also relies on a Routine. For the action, select the music and audio option, then specify the source of your noises. Add a second action by selecting \"Timers & Alarms\" and setting a \"Sleep Timer.\" This ensures that Alexa stops the audio after a set time, like with Apple Home, so you don't have to turn it off manually.\n\nThe best part of having a smart home is remote access to all the appliances and devices you're worried about leaving on or open when you leave the house. You can do this with your garage without dealing with one of those tricky garage door sensor installations, provided you have a compatible smart home hub.\n\nYou can buy a cheap security camera that uses an SD card to monitor the garage door and let you peek in. Or, for around $20, you can buy a small ZigBee-enabled tilt sensor and automate it to check the garage status once the system has detected that everyone is out of the house. In Google Home, you'd attach this sensor to the \"Home & Away status.\" Like the routine we set up for the lights earlier, here you'd choose the tilt sensor to check when \"Everyone is Away.\" If the sensor device status is set to \"open,\" you can select an action to notify you with a custom message. Closing it is still on you, though. If you were the last to leave, you'll need to double back; if someone else was, you can quickly call or text them to turn around and close the door.\n\nApple and Amazon have the same location-based blueprint. On Apple, you'd set up the sensor along with the \"People Leave\" automation, then set the condition to \"Open\" after the last person leaves. Set the Action to send a notification to your device if so. And on Amazon, set a Routine to check for the garage status when you've left the premises.",

    "title": "30 of the Best Modern Christmas Movies",
    "description": "A curated collection of recent Christmas classics.",
    "fullText": "Christmas movies have been a tradition for decades, but the days when our choices were limited to George Bailey contemplating jumping off of a bridge and Ralphie washing his mouth out with Lifebuoy soap are well past us. Holiday movies are an industry in and of themselves, with dozens of new seasonal offerings released each year, starting as soon as the leaves start to turn colors. Most of them are cozy cookie-cutter offerings—relaxing, if largely disposable.\n\nBut among the seasonal glut, new classics do occasionally emerge. Here are 30 more recent holiday classics, from silly comedies, to cozy dramas, to gruesome horrors, queer romances, and even a surprisingly literal adaptation of a Wham! song.\n\nHoliday gatherings always offer great potential for comedy and drama, with The Family Stone landing a bit of each. The setup involves Dermot Mulroney bringing home his new girlfriend, played by a fearlessly brittle Sarah Jessica Parker, for Christmas. That doesn’t go great, with the visitor constantly feeling out of place and embarrassed amid the insular, tight-knit, standoffish clan. But, in the background, strong-willed matriarch Sybil Stone (Diane Keaton) is also looking for an opportunity, amidst the holiday chaos, to reveal a terminal medical diagnosis. The subtle final shot lands like a sledgehammer every time and, of course, the recent passing of Diane Keaton adds a deeper poignance to the film this year—oh and there's maybe a sequel coming coming. Stream The Family Stone on Disney+, Prime Video, and Hulu.\n\nRemaking a 1950 Alec Guinness movie, Last Holiday puts the ever-radiant Queen Latifah in the lead here as Georgia, a department store assistant given the news that she has a rare brain condition and, potentially, only weeks to live (insurance won't cover an operation because of course it won't). Georgia quits her job, sells her stuff, and heads off to the Czech Republic (which looks a lot more like Austria, where Last Holiday was filmed) for the glamorous European holiday spa trip of her dreams. Her workplace crush, Sean (LL Cool J) is hot on her heels. The plot here is nothing new, even leaving aside that the movie is a remake, but Queen Latifah brings her considerable charm and old-school Hollywood swagger to the film. Stream Last Holiday on Paramount+ and Hulu.\n\nA Will Ferrell comedy about a human who identifies as a literal elf has no business being this sweet and smart. Ferrell is Buddy, a kid who was accidentally shipped off to the North Pole as a child, and now he’s off to New York during the holiday season to find his biological father (James Caan). The impressive cast here (Ed Asner, Zooey Deschanel, Peter Dinklage, Bob Newhart) doesn’t hurt one bit. Stream Elf on HBO Max.\n\nA modest box office success, The Holdovers did even better with the critics, earning a Best Picture Oscar nod (among other nominations) and a Best Supporting Actress prize for Da'Vine Joy Randolph. She plays Mary Lamb, the cafeteria manager at a New England prep school stuck on campus during the holiday break with Paul Giamatti, playing a jerky, uptight classics teacher, as well as with a troubled student. Having recently lost her son in Vietnam, Lamb isn't inclined to spend much time with her fellow holdovers; at least until the three of them are forced to come to terms. Rent The Holdovers from Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\nIn the venerable tradition of Bob Clark, who directed Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things and Black Christmas before making his reputation with A Christmas Story, Christopher Smith took a break from directing horror movies to helm this good-natured family comedy. Steve (Rafe Spall) is excited to reunite with his son, 9-year-old Tom (Kit Connor) after a two-year prison sentence. Of course, Christmas is always complicated, and Steve's is more complicated than most. Just as he's trying to navigate parole and visitations, he encounters a man claiming to be Santa (Jim Broadbent) in his garage. The intruder claims to have been testing a new sleigh when things went awry, leading to a crash-landing and several reindeer on the loose. Santa's attempt to reclaim his sled team leads to his incarceration, and to his son's absolute insistence that Santa gets sprung in time to save Christmas. It's silly but heartwarming, and Broadbent in particular seems to be having a blast. Stream Get Santa on Peacock and Tubi.\n\nRoughly inspired by John Ford’s 1948 3 Godfathers, this one finds a drag queen, a teenage runaway, and a good-hearted middle-aged man struggling with alcoholism living on the streets of Tokyo when they come across a baby in a trash bin on Christmas Eve. The lovely, moving adventure that follows comes from director Satoshi Kon, who also directed classics Perfect Blue, Millennium Actress, and Paprika in his too-short life and career. Stream Tokyo Godfathers on Tubi or rent it from Apple TV.\n\nAs not every holiday is happy, not every Christmas movie should go down easy. Lucas Hedges stars here as the title's Ben, the recently clean addict son of Julia Roberts' Holly. He's released from rehab for the holiday, which comes as a surprise to his family. Holly is happy to see him, but leery of the impact he might have on her other children. She allows him to stay at the family home, as long as he is never be out of her sight. What follows is a harrowing 24 hour period during which the two face old ghosts and Ben's past associates threaten the family, even as he struggles to keep a handle on his addiction disorder. There's a bit of light and hope here, but only a bit; the emphasis here is more on realism than a message of holiday cheer. Still, the performances are stellar and the issues at hand will be relatable for a great many of us. Stream Ben is Back on Tubi or rent it from Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\nThis splashy Christmas comedy with a marquee cast (Kristen Stewart, Mackenzie Davis, Alison Brie, Aubrey Plaza, et al.) sits somewhere on the border between Lifetime/Hallmark-style Christmas movie and traditional rom-com. Abby and Harper are a couple that have been dating for nearly a year—but it turns out that Harper had lied about coming out to her parents. And, what with the stress of the holidays, she’s hoping that Abby will play along and pretend to be her roommate until after Christmas. What could go wrong? Stream Happiest Season on Hulu.\n\nStarting a few weeks before the holiday and counting down to the big day, the modern Christmas staple movie weaves together multiple stories of love starring British familiars like Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Keira Knightley, and Colin Firth. If anyone’s ever professed love to you via a series of cue cards on your doorstep, you can thank (or blame) Love Actually. Stream Love Actually on Peacock and Prime Video.\n\n2003 was a banner year for modern Christmas classics, in any flavor you’d choose. The platonic ideal of a rude Christmas movie, Terry Zwigoff’s Bad Santa stars Billy Bob Thornton as Willie Soke, a mall Santa who’s actually a con man, using his seasonal gigs to scope out stores that he can rob at night. He represents everything that you probably don’t want your kid to be around during the holidays (or anytime, really): He’s foul-mouthed, cynical, and abusive whenever he’s not putting on the merest hint of a front for the children. The film does offer a solid Christmas redemption arc in and around scenes of seasonal debauchery—but still, this probably isn’t one for the kids. Stream Bad Santa on HBO Max.\n\nA charming Santa origin story based on nothing in particular, Klaus finds Jesper Johansen, the lazy son of a postmaster general in 19th century Norway forced to a distant island town where he’s tasked with delivering 6,000 letters within a year, otherwise he’ll be cut off from the family fortune. Arriving there, he discovers the two primary feuding families can’t be bothered to send letters for him to deliver, but that reclusive widower Klaus might be willing to help him in a scheme he’s concocted to convince the town’s children to write letters in the hopes of receiving toys in return—toys crafted by old Klaus in hope of a family that never materialized. It’s all beautifully done, and I defy you not to cry during the final act. Stream Klaus on Netflix.\n\nIt’s the holidays, and Regina Fuller (Christine Baranski!) is on her way home to evict a bunch of people so she can sell the land they live on to a mall developer. Naturally she’s got some seasonal learning to do, with help from erstwhile bestie Margeline (Jenifer Lewis!!) and Parton herself, typecast as an all-singing angel. Dolly wrote all the musical numbers, and the results are dorky fun in the best ways, with a deliberate staginess that invites you to appreciate the sentiment without taking things too seriously. The whole cast is several cuts above, as are the dance numbers, choreographed by Debbie Allen. Stream Christmas on the Square.\n\nMaybe \"classic\" is going a bit far here (though time will tell), but there's something to be said for grabbing a glass of wine and having yourself a (lightly) horny holiday. In that vein, Hot Frosty casts Lacey Chabert as a widow running a cafe in the tiny made-up town of Hope Springs, New York. One day she picks up a scarf at a secondhand store and places it around the neck of a particularly chiseled snowman (because while all snowman bodies are valid, it's gonna take abs to score free winter apparel). The snowman naturally comes to life, leading to a series of wacky misunderstandings, but also a little holiday romance. If it's not cinematic genius, it's a perfectly delicious bit of holiday silliness. Stream Hot Frosty on Netflix.\n\nA fictionalized version of a true story, this Academy Award nominee deals with an unusual moment during the first year of World War I, when, at several points along the front lines, French, German, and British soldiers called a series of informal truces, often mingling to celebrate Christmas Eve and Christmas Day. The German Crown Prince even sent the lead singer of the Berlin opera to perform along the front lines, entertaining both sides. In dramatizing the event, the filmmakers understand that the truce was both glorious and absurd. Those complicated feelings, and the knowledge that what we’re seeing represents a momentary lull in a war that would continue for years, make for powerful emotional moments. Stream Joyeux Noël on Tubi and Netflix.\n\nDepressed Englishwoman Iris (Kate Winslet) decides to swap homes and lives, for a bit, with similarly unlucky-in-love Californian Amanda (Cameron Diaz). Iris is now living in a giant Hollywood mansion, while Amanda is exploring a quaint country village. Naturally, romance is waiting for each woman in her newfound environs. It was largely ignored on its initial release, but has grown into a charmingly dorky Christmas cult classic. Word is that Apple is working on an update. Rent The Holiday from Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\nIn the film, the research team of a greedy government drills into land best left undisturbed: an ancient burial mound that, legends suggest, is the resting place of Joulupukki, a pagan forerunner to our modern Santa Claus. BAD IDEA. Old Joulupukki is not dissimilar from Krampus, in that he’s much more interested in punishing the wicked than in rewarding the good. It’s an action-packed, darkly comic, cynical winter’s tale (rather the perfect one for our times) and builds to a wild climax. Stream Rare Exports on Tubi or rent it from Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\nA deeply cute Christmas adventure finds a couple of kids (Judah Lewis and Darby Camp) accidentally crashing Santa’s sleigh (Santa here is played by Kurt Russell). It’s got plenty of (family-friendly) action, and Russell seems to be having a ton of fun. If you like this one, the sequel is approximately as good. Stream The Christmas Chronicles.\n\nAardman Animations, the Wallace and Gromit/Shaun the Sheep people, produced this joyful, quirky computer-animated family film. James McAvoy plays Arthur Claus, son of the current holder of the Santa title. Operations at the North Pole are largely automated, and Arthur has a hard time convincing management that a single undelivered toy is worth much fuss. So it’s clumsy, goofy Arthur to the rescue, with the certain knowledge that ruining even one kid’s holiday would be a failure. Stream Arthur Christmas on Prime Video and Tubi.\n\nThe long-awaited sequel to 1999's The Best Man, this one quickly updates us on the fallout from that earlier film before moving into new territory (it’s not strictly necessary to have seen the original if you’re looking to dive straight into the holiday festivities). Morris Chestnut, Taye Diggs, Regina Hall, Terrence Howard, and Sanaa Lathan lead the sequel, which offers a bold blend of off-color humor, hot shirtless guys, sincere religious themes, and shamelessly heartbreaking plot twists. Stream The Best Man Holiday on Peacock and Hulu or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nJust your typical girlfriend/buddy/revenge comedy movie about two trans sex workers on the hunt for the man who did one of them wrong. As heartfelt as it is madcap, it all takes place on a wild Christmas Eve in Hollywood (so don’t expect snow). Shot on a couple of iPhones, director Sean Baker and company make a virtue of the intimacy and immediacy that modern technology can bring. Stream Tangerine on Peacock and Hulu or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nMara Rooney’s Therese and Cate Blanchett’s glamorous Carol set off sparks when they meet in a department store during the Christmas season of 1952. The women suffer for their growing attraction, and this certainly isn’t the breeziest of holiday movies, but there’s light here, and beauty, and hope for the future. Stream Carol on HBO Max or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nThe last (to date) of the Harold and Kumar movies, this one balances stoner humor with a surprising sweetness, even if it's the kind of Christmas movie in which Santa smokes a bong on his holiday rounds and replacement urine for a drug test more than qualifies as a nice Christmas present. Stream A Very Harold and Kumar Christmas on Paramount+ or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nWhat else are you gonna do Christmas Eve than spend the night with your best friends (Seth Rogan, Anthony Mackie, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt) at something called the Nutcracker Ball? Yeah, sounds awful to me, too. Luckily they’ve got a ton of drugs to get them through the night. A reliably entertaining stoner Christmas story. Stream The Night Before on Peacock and Tubi or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nAmong the best of a decade’s worth of films reviving ancient, scary European traditions involving far less jolly versions of Santa, Krampus is a Gremlins-esque horror comedy with imaginative creature effects from the folks over at Weta Workshop. It might not be the darkest, nor the goriest, of holiday-themed horror sendups, but it is an awful lot of fun, with effects that evoke a twisted winter wonderland as we follow a family being hunted by the title demon. Stream Krampus on Peacock or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nThough I might still stick with the 1966 animated version (Boris Karloff FTW), as updates go, this 2018 version is bright and colorful and energetic without getting stressful (looking at you, Jim Carrey version from 2000). Benedict Cumberbatch plays the Grinch; Pharrell narrates; and Rashida Jones, Kenan Thompson, and Angela Lansbury round out the solid voice cast. Stream The Grinch on Peacock or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nZombies for Christmas? OK! In this mash-up of High School Musical and Shaun of the Dead that you never knew you needed, the titular Anna just wants to get through the Christmas show at her high school in Little Haven, Scotland. She’s so preoccupied with her own problems that she fails to notice the undead infection spreading around her. It’s a weird blend of styles, no question, but one packed with gory fun, musical numbers, and some surprising, seasonally appropriate heart. Stream Anna and the Apocalypse on Prime Video and Tubi.\n\nThere are plenty of versions of A Christmas Carol to choose from, but this one examines that tale from the other side. It’s the story of Charles Dickens himself (Dan Stevens) and his journey to creating the wildly successful work. Dodging typical biopic tropes in favor of something more appropriate to the subject matter, the movie finds Dickens interacting with his fictional characters in a film that blends realism with whimsical fantasy. Stream The Man Who Invented Christmas on HBO Max or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nEmilia Clarke and America’s sweetheart Henry Golding have tremendous chemistry as a down-on-her-luck aspiring singer and the slightly mysterious man with whom she shares a lovely and inspiring holiday season. The twist ending here, inspired by a literal reading of the title song, is bonkers—but it works better than it has a right to. Stream Last Christmas on Netflix or rent it from Prime Video.\n\nBefore Barbie, Greta Gerwig took on an American classic and, while I’m not sure there’s ever been a bad adaptation of Little Women, this one is at the top of the pile, staying faithful to the novel’s themes while rearranging the narrative just a bit, and adding elements from Alcott’s own life to hint at the ending that the author really wanted. Rent Little Women from Prime Video and Apple TV.\n\nThis one’s a straight-up fantasy that finds toymaker Jeronicus Jangle (Forest Whitaker) inventing a sentient matador figure (Ricky Martin) who fights for his right to be something other than a mass-produced toy. That sets off a series of misfortunes for Jeronicus, but his granddaughter Journey (Madalen Mills) is on hand to try to put things right. The pedigree here includes playwright David E. Talbert in the director’s chair and an almost all-Black cast that includes Whitaker, Keegan-Michael Key, and Anika Noni Rose, all having a lot of fun in a colorful (and musical!) adventure. Stream Jingle Jangle on Netflix.\n\nSick of questions about being single, Peter (Michael Urie) decides to invite his best friend Nick (Philemon Chambers) to pose as more than his roommate. He’s in a high-stress L.A. job, and heading home for the holidays in New Hampshire and just can’t deal with cracks about being single. His mom (Kathy Najimy), though, already had plans to fix him up with her fitness instructor (Luke Macfarlane). Now James has to navigate not only his family obligations and his new date, but also his developing feelings for the guy who was just supposed to be a pretend romance.

    "title": "iFixit's New AI Assistant Can Help You Fix Almost Anything",
    "description": "There are reasons to believe it will be more trustworthy than ChatGPT.",
    "fullText": "Generative AI has advanced to the stage where you can ask bots such as ChatGPT or Gemini questions about almost anything, and get reasonable-sounding responses—and now renowned gadget repair site iFixit has joined the party with an AI assistant of its own, ready and willing to solve any of your hardware problems.\n\nWhile you can already ask general-purpose chatbots for advice on how to repair a phone screen or diagnose a problem with a car engine, there's always the question of how accurate the AI replies will be. With FixBot, iFixit is trying to minimize mistakes by drawing on its vast library of verified repair guides, written by experts and users.\n\nThat's certainly reassuring: I don't want to waste time and money replacing a broken phone screen with a new display that's the wrong size or shape. And using a conversational AI bot to fix gadget problems is often going to feel like a more natural and intuitive experience than a Google search. As iFixit puts it, the bot \"does what a good expert does\" in guiding you to the right solutions.\n\nThe iFixit website has been around since 2003—practically ancient times, considering the rapid evolution of modern technology. The iFixit team has always prided itself on detailed, thorough, tested guides to repairing devices, and all of that information can now be tapped into by the FixBot tool.\n\niFixit says the bot is trained on more than 125,000 repair guides written by humans who have worked through the steps involved, as well as the question and answer forums attached to the site, and the \"huge cache\" of PDF manuals that iFixit has accumulated over the years that it's been business.\n\nThat gives me a lot more confidence that FixBot will get its answers right, compared to whatever ChatGPT or Gemini might tell me. iFixit hasn't said what AI models are powering the bot—only that they've been \"hand-picked\"—and there's also a custom-built search engine included to select data sources from the repair archives on the site.\n\n\"Every answer starts with a search for guides, parts, and repairs that worked,\" according to the iFixit team, and that conversational approach you'll recognize from other AI bots is here too: If you need clarification on something, then you can ask a follow-up question. In the same way, if the AI bot needs more information or specifics, it will ask you.\n\nIt's designed to be fast—responses should be returned in seconds—and the iFixit team also talks about an \"evaluation harness\" that tests the FixBot responses against thousands of real repair questions posed and answered by humans. That extra level of fact-checking should reduce the number of false answers you get.\n\nHowever, it's not perfect, as iFixit admits: \"FixBot is an AI, and AI sometimes gets things wrong.\" Whether or not those mistakes will be easy to spot remains to be seen, but users of the chatbot are being encouraged to upload their own documents and repair solutions to fix gaps in the knowledge that FixBot is drawing on.\n\niFixit says the FixBot is going to be free for everyone to use, for a limited time. At some point, there will be a free version with limitations, and paid tiers with the full set of features—including support for voice input and document uploads. You can give it a try for yourself now on the iFixit website.\n\nI was reluctant to deliberately break one of my devices just so FixBot could help me repair it, but I did test it with a few issues I've had (and sorted out) in the past. One was a completely dead SSD drive stopping my Windows PC from booting: I started off with a vague description about the computer not starting up properly, and the bot did a good job at narrowing down what the problem was, and suggesting fixes.\n\nIt went through everything I had already tried when the problem happened, including trying System Repair and troubleshooting the issue via the Command Prompt. Eventually, via a few links to repair guides on the iFixit website, it did conclude that my SSD drive had been corrupted by a power cut—which I knew was what had indeed happened.\n\nI also tested the bot with a more general question about a phone restarting at random times—something one of my old handsets used to do. Again, the responses were accurate, and the troubleshooting steps I was asked to try made a lot of sense. I was also directed to the iFixit guide for the phone model.\n\nThe bot is as enthusiastic as a lot of the others available now (I was regularly praised for the \"excellent information\" I was providing), and does appear to know what it's talking about. This is one of the scenarios where generative AI shows its worth, in distilling a large amount of information based on natural language prompts.\n\nThere's definitely potential here: Compare this approach to having to sift through dozens of forum posts, web articles, and documents manually. However, there's always that nagging sense that AI makes mistakes, as the on-screen FixBot disclaimer says. I'd recommend checking other sources before doing anything drastic with your hardware troubleshooting.",

    "title": "How to Set Up Your Own Custom Focus Modes on iPhone",
    "description": "Don't sleep on this powerful iPhone feature.",
    "fullText": "The iPhone's Focus modes are perhaps its most underrated feature. Once customized, they can become incredibly powerful tools that put you in control of how your iPhone can grab your attention. They can take some time to set up, but it’s worth it. Once you've got everything squared away, you'll have timed boundaries from certain apps, people, and even your work, for that mythical work-life balance. Forget having a personal phone and a work phone—a couple of well-tuned Focus modes might be enough.\n\nWhat used to be Do Not Disturb on iPhone is now Focus mode, which comes with many more options. Open the Control Center and tap the Focus button to see a list of all available Focus modes. The familiar Do Not Disturb option will be up top, but you’ll also see helpful Focus modes premade by Apple, Sleep being a prominent example. If you have a device that supports Apple Intelligence, you’ll also see a mode called Reduce Interruptions, which automatically mutes all notifications except the really important ones. Other premade modes include Personal, Work, and Sleep, which you can all customize to your own liking.\n\nTo get the most out of Focus Modes, you should set some Focus modes for yourself. One for work and one for personal time would be a great place to start. Go to Settings > Focus and tap the Plus button at the top. Here, choose the Custom mode option to get the most flexibility. Give it a name, icon, and tap Next. Then, tap Customize Focus.\n\nThis is where you'll do most of your work. First, tap Choose People and select if you want to allow notifications from only a couple of people, or if you want to silence notifications from particular folks. If you’re setting up a Focus mode for personal time, you might want to stop notifications only from your boss and colleagues. Choose the people to allow, and tap Next. Then, choose who is allowed to call you. You can limit it to just your Favorites, or only a handful of people.\n\nThen, tap Choose Apps and follow the same process for apps as well, either allowing notifications from some apps, or only silencing notifications from particular apps. For example, if you’re setting up a Focus mode for personal time, you might want to disable notifications from work apps like Slack, Teams, Gmail, and more. Tap into the Options menu, and you can also choose to show silenced notifications on the Lock Screen, or to dim the lock screen every time that Focus mode is enabled.\n\nNext, take some time to customize what you see when a Focus mode is enabled. Apple will let you choose a distinct Lock screen, Home screen and even an Apple Watch watch face per Focus mode. For example, your work Focus can feature just your calendar and to do list. This will go a long way towards cementing the Focus state in your mind. For example, when I’m in my Writing Focus mode, my home screen is devoid of everything, including my tasks widget and communication apps.\n\nThen, you’ll see a Set a Schedule section. Here, you can turn on a Smart Activation feature that will automatically enable a Focus mode depending on your location, app usage and so on. This has been hit or miss for me, so I would advise you to avoid it for the most reliable results. But you can definitely create a manual schedule using the Add Schedule button. Here, You can trigger a Focus mode to automatically start or stop at a certain time of day.\n\nYou can even use Focus Filters to further customize exactly what apps can show you when you’re in a Focus mode. For example, you can choose to only see your work calendar when you’re in your work Focus, but not your other calendars. These filters work for Apple’s apps and even third-party apps.\n\nLastly, you can choose to enable the Intelligent Breakthrough & Silencing feature that's found at the top of the Focus page. If you have an iPhone with Apple Intelligence enabled, you'll see this setting. It uses on-device intelligence to allow priority notifications to interrupt you even when you're in silent mode. This goes over all other customizations that you might've done. But, being an Apple Intelligence feature, its reliability can be a bit iffy. Based on personal experience, I would recommend you take the time to fully customize the Focus mode to your liking instead of handing some of that work over to Apple Intelligence, as it gets things wrong for me fairly often.",

    "description": "Be careful with ChatGPT or Grok's tech advice.",
    "fullText": "You (hopefully) know by now that you can't take everything AI tells you at face value. Large language models (LLMs) sometimes provide incorrect information, and threat actors are now using paid search ads on Google to spread conversations with ChatGPT and Grok that appear to provide tech support instructions but actually direct macOS users to install an infostealing malware on their devices.\n\nThe campaign is a variation on the ClickFix attack, which often uses CAPTCHA prompts or fake error messages to trick targets into executing malicious commands. But in this case, the instructions are disguised as helpful troubleshooting guides on legitimate AI platforms.\n\nKaspersky details a campaign specific to installing Atlas for macOS. If a user searches \"chatgpt atlas\" to find a guide, the first sponsored result is a link to chatgpt.com with the page title \"ChatGPT™ Atlas for macOS – Download ChatGPT Atlas for Mac.\" If you click through, you'll land on the official ChatGPT site and find a series of instructions for (supposedly) installing Atlas.\n\nHowever, the page is a copy of a conversation between an anonymous user and the AI—which can be shared publicly—that is actually a malware installation guide. The chat directs you to copy, paste, and execute a command in your Mac's Terminal and grant all permissions, which hands over access to the AMOS (Atomic macOS Stealer) infostealer.\n\nA further investigation from Huntress showed similarly poisoned results via both ChatGPT and Grok using more general troubleshooting queries like \"how to delete system data on Mac\" and \"clear disk space on macOS.\"\n\nAMOS targets macOS, gaining root-level privileges and allowing attackers to execute commands, log keystrokes, and deliver additional payloads. BleepingComputer notes that the infostealer also targets cryptocurrency wallets, browser data (including cookies, saved passwords, and autofill data), macOS Keychain data, and files on the filesystem.\n\nIf you're troubleshooting a tech issue, carefully vet any instructions you find online. Threat actors often use sponsored search results as well as social media platforms to spread instructions that are actually ClickFix attacks. Never follow any guidance that you don't understand, and know that if it asks you to execute commands on your device using PowerShell or Terminal to \"fix\" a problem, there's a high likelihood that it's malicious—even if it comes from a search engine or LLM you've used and trusted in the past.\n\nOf course, you can potentially turn the attack around by asking ChatGPT (in a new conversation) if the instructions are safe to follow. According to Kaspersky, the AI will tell you that they aren't.",

    "fullText": "on December 15, 2025 at 6:00AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nArc Raiders' second major update, Cold Snap, is seasonally appropriate, bringing plenty of snow and chilly conditions to the popular extraction shooter. In the Cold Snap update, players can now explore snow-covered maps while braving the elements, unlock tons of new cosmetics and other fun items, and (optionally) see their raider off with the game's first Expedition reset. However, some of this is only available for a limited time, so you'll want to know what you're getting into. Since there's so much here to see and do, let's dive in and take a look at everything new in the Cold Snap update.\n\nThe Cold Snap update includes the second Raider Deck since Arc Raiders' launch--the Goalie Raider Deck--though it won't be accessible until Friday, December 26. As with the previous deck, this fresh addition is free for all players, meaning you won't have to spend any of your precious real-life money to get all the goodies inside. However, since Raider Decks function like a battle pass you'd see in many other games, you will need to spend some time working toward earning Creds via the daily Feats system if you want to purchase everything. And you may very well want to do so, as it contains a new hockey-inspired outfit, other cosmetics, and even in-game items that can help you on your raids.\n\nNote that, unlike standard battle passes in most live-service titles, this Raider Deck is a permanent addition to the game. As such, you can unlock its rewards at your own pace without fear that it'll disappear after a set period of time. It's uncertain whether this trend will continue with every Raider Deck, but it's nice to see for now.\n\nOne of the biggest additions--and perhaps the reason this update is dubbed Cold Snap--is the all-new Snowfall map condition. This map condition coats the map in snow, which reduces visibility and adds an extra layer of fear while exploring topside. This map condition is available for Dam Battlegrounds, Buried City, Spaceport, and Blue Gate. Those who engage with it are all but certain to find themselves pushed to the limit and forced to reconsider how they approach nearly every encounter. That's because, in addition to the reduced visibility, players will have to contend with other raiders tracking their footsteps through the snow and a concerning new mechanic that you might not have expected: frostbite.\n\nYeah, you read that right. Frostbite is nipping at your toes in Arc Raiders' anytime you dive into a Snowfall map condition. This mechanic causes your health to slowly drain when exposed to the elements for too long, forcing you to find shelter indoors. This can potentially push you into other raiders who are also seeking safety, meaning a shootout could be imminent if one team chooses not to be friendly. If you want to survive these dreadful conditions, you'll want to play smart, bring more heals than ever, and keep your friends close so that you don't end up separated and slaughtered by other groups who may be lurking in even the safest spots on the map.\n\nAs part of the Cold Snap update, players are now also automatically enrolled in the Flickering Flames event, which contains up to 25 rewards that can be earned while playing the game. You automatically gain Merits when you earn XP in a round, which are then cashed in when you return to Speranza, netting you gear, cosmetic customizations, and Raider Tokens--Arc Raiders' premium currency.\n\nSince Merits are earned by simply doing anything that grants XP, netting every reward on the track should come reasonably easy for regular players. If you want to speed things up, though, just focus on high-XP situations, such as killing larger ARC enemies like Bastions, Bombardiers, Leapers, or Rocketeers.\n\nNote that you need to have played at least five rounds of Arc Raiders to be eligible for the Flickering Flames event.\n\nThe Cold Snap update includes a new project you can tackle called the Candleberry Banquet, too. This marks the second project in the game so far, and it functions a bit differently than the Expedition (which we've covered a bit further down). For this project, players need to complete five stages by seeking out Candleberries and other unique items while adventuring topside. Each stage reveals a new scene at the banquet table in Speranza, while also earning you additional cosmetics, Raider Tokens, and more. Even better, you'll earn Merits for completing these stages, which will help you toward finishing up the Flickering Flames event as well!\n\nLastly, the Cold Snap update also corresponds with Arc Raiders' first Expedition reset. From December 17 to December 23, players who have completed the full Expedition requirements will be able to This wipe removes all blueprints, levels, quests, upgrades, and credits earned so far, while earning players some unique bonuses.\n\nThose who opt to send their raiders away on the Expedition will be granted the following bonuses:\n\nPlayers will need to have put in some serious time and effort to earn all five of the bonus skill points for this first Expedition, however. You net one permanent skill point for each million in credits you currently have upon setting off on the Expedition, meaning you'll need to have gathered a total of five million credits to obtain every possible skill point available. If you haven't obtained this much money yet, you'll have until December 22 to get it all together and",

Anime skins are clearly popular, so it makes sense that more are coming. Next up is Bleach, the beloved show that began in the 2004, and which is currently running a revival series to finish telling the manga's story, called Bleach: Thousand-Year Blood War.\nThis first collaboration with Bleach will, according to posters that have been spotted in the wild, include four skins: Ichigo Kurosaki, Rukia Kuchiki, Orihime Inoue, and Uryu Ishida.

    "description": "Ethereum price trades near a breakout zone as selling pressure eases. Key levels now decide whether $4,000 comes into play.",
    "fullText": "Ethereum price action looks quiet, but the entire formation is slowly turning bullish. Over the past 24 hours, ETH has traded almost flat, while the past seven days show a modest 2.6% gain. Price has remained above $3,100 for several sessions, suggesting strength rather than exhaustion.\n\nThis sideways move is not random. Ethereum is compressing near key levels, where breakouts often form. The next move depends on whether buyers, who are gradually returning, can turn this consolidation into a continuation.\n\nEthereum appears to be breaking out after consolidating inside a bull flag. A bull flag forms when the price pauses after a strong upward move, then trades in a narrow range before the next leg higher. This pattern signals consolidation, not weakness.\n\nThe structure remains intact as long as ETH holds above $3,090. That means, unless there is a daily candle close below this level, the much-anticipated breakout might hold.\n\nThis level has acted as firm support, absorbing selling pressure during recent pullbacks. Price has repeatedly bounced from this zone, showing buyers are still defending it.\n\nWant more token insights like this? \n\nA clean daily close above $3,130 would be the first confirmation that the flag is resolving higher. That move would signal that consolidation is ending and buyers are regaining control. Without that close, Ethereum remains in compression, but the bullish structure stays valid.\n\nOn-chain data support the price structure. Holder Net Position Change, which tracks whether long-term investors are adding or selling ETH, shows that selling pressure has eased compared to earlier sessions.\n\nOn December 12, Ethereum holders distributed roughly 958,771 ETH. By December 13, net selling dropped to around 877,958 ETH, marking a decline of roughly 8.4% in selling pressure within 24 hours.\n\nThat shift matters. Ethereum is still seeing net distribution, but the pace of selling is slowing as the price compresses near resistance. This behavior typically appears during late-stage consolidation, not during breakdowns.\n\nWhen selling pressure eases near a key level without price slipping lower, it increases the odds that buyers step in once a breakout confirms. Ethereum is not seeing panic exits. Instead, holders appear more willing to wait.\n\nIf the Ethereum price secures a daily close above $3,130, the next resistance sits near $3,390. Clearing that zone would open the path toward the $4,000–$4,020 area, aligning with the measured move from the bull flag structure.",

    "fullText": "Newcastle United defender Dan Burn is set for a spell out of action after suffering a broken rib and punctured lung in Sunday's derby defeat against Sunderland.\n\nBurn, 33, was injured in a 50/50 challenge with Sunderland right-back Nordi Mukiele during the first half as Newcastle lost 1-0 at the Stadium of Light.\n\nMukiele was booked after his knee crashed into Burn's side as both players slid in to win the ball.\n\nAlthough Burn tried to carry on, following some initial treatment, he was replaced by Fabian Schar a few minutes later.\n\nHead coach Eddie Howe later revealed the centre-back was taken to hospital after he \"struggled to breathe\" at half-time.\n\nA punctured lung occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and chest wall. This causes the lung to collapse.\n\nHowe is set to provide a more detailed prognosis at his news conference on Tuesday - but Burn looks set to miss a host of games over the festive period and into the new year.\n\n\"We're stretched in our backline,\" Howe said on Sunday. \"We have got a number of injuries and that is alarming for us. It's not a perfect field for us currently. We're battling a few situations.\"\n\nCentre-back Sven Botman had already been sidelined with a back issue while Kieran Trippier is recovering from a hamstring problem, and fellow right-back Emil Krafth from a knee injury.\n\nSchar looks set to partner Malick Thiaw for Wednesday's Carabao Cup quarter-final against Tottenham Hotspur at St James' Park.\n\nBut Newcastle have few senior options available to ease the load on the pair or on full-backs Lewis Hall and Tino Livramento, who only recently returned from injury.",

    "description": "Some prominent Republicans on Capitol Hill called out the president for his sick post about the murder of a beloved director.",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON ― Several Republicans in the House of Representatives rebuked President Donald Trump on Monday over his creepy social media post about the killing of director Rob Reiner and his wife, Michele Reiner.\n\nReps. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) ― right-wingers who’ve been on the president’s bad side lately ― reacted with disgust to Trump musing that the two were murdered because of Reiner’s “Trump Derangement Syndrome.”\n\nPolitics: Pinched By Higher Prices, Many Trump Voters Say: Don't Blame The President\n\n“Regardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered,” Massie wrote on X, above an image of the president’s post.\n\n“I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they’re afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it,” Massie said.\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R-N.Y.), a moderate, also chimed in.\n\n“This statement is wrong. Regardless of one’s political views, no one should be subjected to violence, let alone at the hands of their own son,” Lawler wrote. “It’s a horrible tragedy that should engender sympathy and compassion from everyone in our country, period.”\n\nRegardless of how you felt about Rob Reiner, this is inappropriate and disrespectful discourse about a man who was just brutally murdered. I guess my elected GOP colleagues, the VP, and White House staff will just ignore it because they’re afraid? I challenge anyone to defend it. pic.twitter.com/j3dvzRxLQJ\n\n— Thomas Massie (@RepThomasMassie) December 15, 2025\n\nTrump wrote Monday that the couple had died “reportedly due to the anger he caused others through his massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with a mind crippling disease known as TRUMP DERANGEMENT SYNDROME.”\n\nReiner, director of films including “The Princess Bride” and “When Harry Met Sally,” had criticized Trump, once calling him “the single-most unqualified human being to ever assume the presidency of the United States.”\n\nPolitics: Detail In 1 New Epstein Estate Pic Makes CNN Anchor Pause: 'Can't Believe I Have To Read This'\n\nThe Reiners were found stabbed to death in their home on Sunday. Police have arrested their 32-year-old son but haven’t announced charges. The younger Reiner has struggled with addiction and homelessness.\n\nGreene denounced Trump’s message within minutes of Massie.\n\n“This is a family tragedy, not about politics or political enemies,” Greene wrote. “Many families deal with a family member with drug addiction and mental health issues. It’s incredibly difficult and should be met with empathy especially when it ends in murder.”\n\nGreene was one of Trump’s biggest supporters in Congress before their falling-out this year over her support of Massie’s legislation to force the Justice Department to release its files on Jeffrey Epstein, the late ****** predator who was Trump’s friend.\n\nPolitics: Critics ‘Horrified’ By Trump’s 3 Words About Brown University Shooting\n\nEven though they’ve clashed with Trump, the posts by Massie, Greene and Lawler were remarkable ― for a decade, most elected Republicans have sought to avoid commenting on Trump’s outrageous social media activity. Lawmakers typically tell reporters they haven’t had a chance to see what the president has said.\n\nEarlier this year, after the president posted a video of himself piloting a jet that dumped excrement on “No Kings” protesters, House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) laughed off a question by saying Trump is just a great poster.\n\n“The president uses social media to make a point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that,” Johnson said.\n\nThe spontaneous public criticism from members of Johnson’s conference on Monday is another small signal that Trump’s grip on his party has slipped.\n\nPolitics: Marjorie Taylor Greene Says She Feels Sorry For Trump\n\nJenna Ellis, a member of Trump’s 2020 campaign legal team, also condemned his comments.\n\n“The Right uniformly condemned political and celebratory responses to Charlie Kirk’s death,” Ellis wrote on X. “This is a horrible example from Trump (and surprising considering the two attempts on his own life) and should be condemned by everyone with any decency.”\n\nTrump Blames Rob Reiner For His Own Death In Truth Social Post\n\nRob And Michele Reiner's Son In Custody After Stabbing Deaths\n\nOBITUARY: Rob Reiner, Son Of A Comedy Giant Who Became One Himself, Dead At 78",

    "fullText": "on December 15, 2025 at 10:28AM PST\n\nGameSpot may receive revenue from affiliate and advertising partnerships for sharing this content and from purchases through links.\n\nUnpacking resonated with players for its rare combination of meditative gameplay, tactile feedback, and wordless storytelling. Each move from one room to the next wasn’t just about organizing items but rediscovering memories. If you’ve been craving more games that offer the same mix of reflection, quiet joy, and low-stress puzzles, you’re in luck.\n\nFrom cozy organizing sims to thoughtful narrative puzzlers, these games channel that same sense of calm. Some may look nothing like Unpacking, but they have some of the same core elements that elicit the same feelings while playing. Here are 15 games like Unpacking that will make you feel just as relaxed as Unpacking did in 2021.\n\nA Little to the Left takes the satisfaction of cleaning and organizing and turns it into a playful puzzle box. Each level challenges you to arrange household objects into just the right order, whether it’s aligning pencils by size, stacking jars by color, or folding paper perfectly. A small catch though--a mischievous cat will often swipe in to mess up your hard work, keeping things delightfully unpredictable whenever you see that furry paw pop on screen.\n\nThe game shares Unpacking’s love for small, satisfying tasks. Instead of unpacking boxes, you’re tidying up clutter, and each finished puzzle offers the same tiny dopamine hit that comes from making sense of chaos. Its minimalist design, cozy soundtrack, and multiple puzzle solutions encourage creativity rather than strict precision.\n\nMax Inferno’s creation captures the same meditative tone that made Unpacking so special--small moments of order that carry big emotional weight.\n\nAssemble With Care has you fixing more than just broken gadgets. You play as Maria, a traveling restorer who helps a town of strangers repair their most cherished possessions--cameras, cassette players, and family heirlooms. Each repair tells a small story, revealing how memories and emotions are often wrapped up in the objects we keep.\n\nWhere Unpacking unfolds a life through placement, Assemble With Care does it through restoration. Both games let you learn about a character’s history without a single line of dialogue telling you what to feel. The tactile puzzle-solving also scratches the same itch--you twist screws, slot in gears, and reassemble each piece until it clicks into place.\n\nIt’s a brief but powerful experience about empathy and craftsmanship, and one of the most emotionally resonant puzzle games you can find.\n\nVenba tells the story of an Indian immigrant family rebuilding their lives in Canada, expressed entirely through food. You’ll cook traditional Tamil dishes, following recipes handed down through generations, while uncovering the challenges of balancing heritage and assimilation.\n\nMuch like Unpacking, Venba uses simple mechanics to explore complex emotions. Every action--stirring a pot, kneading dough, tasting spices--feels deeply personal, tied to memory and belonging. You aren’t just completing tasks; you’re preserving culture and reconnecting with family.\n\nIt’s a touching and beautifully-illustrated story that captures the same kind of quiet, introspective tone. Instead of unpacking boxes, you’re unpacking identity.\n\nIf you loved the organizing aspect of Unpacking, Wilmot’s Warehouse takes that concept to its most literal extreme. You play as Wilmot, a cheerful little square tasked with sorting and delivering boxes in a warehouse. There are no labels, no instructions--just a sea of colorful icons and your own system to make sense of it all.\n\nAs the game progresses, your warehouse fills with hundreds of unique items, forcing you to adapt your layout and memory to keep up. The challenge is simple but satisfying: efficiency meets creativity. It’s a celebration of the human urge to impose order on chaos, and the satisfaction that comes when everything finally fits just right.\n\nWhile Unpacking ties emotion to personal belongings, Wilmot’s Warehouse finds its beauty in pure organization. It’s a different kind of zen, one where structure and flow replace narrative.\n\nDorfromantik transforms the idea of \"building a world\" into a soothing, tile-based art form. You place hexagonal tiles one by one to create sprawling landscapes of villages, forests, and rivers, watching your tranquil little world unfold with each move.\n\nWhat connects Dorfromantik to Unpacking is its pace and purpose. There’s no rush, no competition--just you, your tiles, and the satisfaction of making something harmonious. Every placement brings calm, and every new tile opens up a chance for discovery.\n\nIt’s a perfect wind-down game that offers the same sense of calm progress that Unpacking nails so effortlessly. If you’re looking for a low-stakes puzzle that rewards patience and pattern-making, this is it.\n\nThere are no goals, timers, or points in Townscaper--just an infinite sea and your imagination. Click anywhere to build a colorful house, connect them into streets, or let crooked towers rise over gentle waves. Every block you place snaps into charming shapes, creating a miniature city that feels alive.\n\nLike Unpacking, it’s a meditation on creation and discovery. Each tap adds another story or possibility, and watching your seaside town come together has the same quiet satisfaction as placing the final item on a shelf. There’s a kind of storytelling that emerges naturally from your designs--you might start imagining who lives in that blue house or what goes on in that hilltop tower.\n\nTownscaper is proof that structure and serenity can come from the simplest mechanics. It’s the perfect space to unwind and let your creativity drift.\n\nCats Organized Neatly asks a simple but delightful question: how many oddly shaped cats can you fit into one box? Each puzzle presents a cozy grid and a handful of cats in different poses --stretching, curling, or loafing-- that you’ll rotate and arrange until everything fits perfectly.\n\nLike Unpacking, it captures that unique satisfaction of placement--the joy of finding the right spot for each piece. Every solved level delivers a little burst of calm, accompanied by gentle music and a cast of cats so cute you’ll wish they were real.\n\nIt’s a game about tidiness, spatial reasoning, and feline comfort. If Unpacking’s organizing appealed to your inner perfectionist, Cats Organized Neatly will have you smiling with every snug fit.\n\nFew things are more satisfying than seeing dirt disappear under a steady stream of water, and PowerWash Simulator, and its recent sequel, bottles that feeling perfectly. You’ll clean everything from garden furniture and vans to entire amusement parks, transforming grime-covered surfaces into spotless works of art.\n\nIt’s a very different setting than Unpacking, but the core feeling is the same: slow, methodical progress that rewards patience. The rhythmic hiss of the power washer, the subtle shine of freshly cleaned metal--it’s a surprisingly meditative loop that invites you to zone out and unwind.\n\nPowerWash Simulator turns an everyday chore into something peaceful and purposeful. Like Unpacking, it’s not about winning or losing; it’s about the quiet joy of completion.\n\nHouse Flipper and its 2023 sequel expand Unpacking’s decorating DNA into full-blown renovation. You’ll buy rundown properties, clean every room, fix walls, paint surfaces, and fill each space with furniture and décor. It’s part simulation, part creative outlet, and every makeover feels like your own personal HGTV episode.\n\nMuch like Unpacking, there’s something deeply personal about transforming a space. You start with clutter and decay, but through patience and creativity, you bring warmth and personality to each home. There’s no wrong way to design, just endless ways to express your vision.\n\nHouse Flipper captures that sense of tangible progress--of shaping chaos into comfort. It’s bigger and busier than Unpacking, but the spirit of restoration remains at its heart.\n\nThe Shape of Things turns the idea of organizing into something delightfully abstract. Each puzzle asks you to rotate and slide pieces of everyday objects until they click together into a recognizable form. It’s part 3D jigsaw and part meditative sculpting session.\n\nLike Unpacking, it’s a celebration of the small and tactile. There’s no timer or pressure--just a soft soundtrack and the gentle rhythm of discovery as you fit each piece into place. The game’s slow pace encourages you to focus on the process rather than the outcome, rewarding patience and observation.\n\nEvery completed object feels like a little victory, a reminder that even in the simplest tasks, there’s beauty in attention and care. It’s the same feeling Unpacking delivers with every perfectly placed item.\n\nSticky Business blends creativity and storytelling into one cozy little business sim. You design and print your own stickers, package orders for customers, and manage your growing online shop. Between crafting designs and fulfilling requests, you’ll learn about your customers’ lives through heartfelt messages that come with each order.\n\nMuch like Unpacking, it’s a game about the emotional connections behind ordinary objects. The stickers you create become small pieces of someone else’s story, and your workspace fills with life and meaning over time. It’s calm, personal, and delightfully expressive.\n\nSticky Business captures that same peaceful momentum of organizing and creating something by hand. It’s not about efficiency--it’s about putting a little piece of yourself into every package.\n\nA Little Golf Journey reimagines golf as a tranquil exploration rather than a competitive sport. You’ll guide your ball through serene, diorama-like courses, uncovering hidden paths and secret collectibles as you play. There’s no rush--just peaceful landscapes and satisfying physics.\n\nWhat ties it to Unpacking is the atmosphere. Each shot feels deliberate, each small success is fulfilling. The minimalist visuals and gentle soundtrack create a rhythm that lets your thoughts wander, offering the same kind of mindful escape.\n\nIt’s a game that encourages you to slow down and savor the moment. Whether you’re knocking a ball across a wooden bridge or over a sleepy forest, it channels the same calm curiosity that makes Unpacking so endearing.\n\nGarden Paws lets you run a cozy shop in a colorful world filled with adorable animal villagers. You’ll farm crops, decorate your home, manage your store, and explore the surrounding countryside at your own pace. It’s as gentle as it sounds--a sandbox for anyone who loves wholesome progression and creative freedom.\n\nLike Unpacking, it’s built on the joy of tending and curating. Every new shelf arrangement or garden plot feels personal, reflecting the care you put into it. The game doesn’t rush you or weigh you down with complex systems--it’s all about relaxation through routine.\n\nGarden Paws is the kind of game that feels like coming home after a long day. It shares Unpacking’s sense of quiet purpose, where the smallest actions carry meaning.\n\nLittle Inferno is deceptively simple: you burn toys in a fireplace. But as you stack and ignite strange objects, an unsettling and emotional story unfolds behind the flames. It’s about warmth and destruction, nostalgia and letting go.\n\nAt first, it feels playful and chaotic, but the more you play, the clearer its message becomes. Every toy you burn reveals fragments of a larger narrative about childhood, consumerism, and change. It’s not about progress in the traditional sense--it’s about introspection.\n\nDespite the darker edge, Little Inferno’s core is the same as Unpacking’s: finding meaning in everyday objects and understanding how they shape who we are. It’s cozy yet haunting.\n\nTerra Nil flips the usual city-builder concept on its head. Instead of constructing sprawling urban centers, you’re tasked with healing a barren wasteland. You’ll place wind turbines, irrigation systems, and tree planters to transform dead ground into vibrant ecosystems filled with life.\n\nThe connection to Unpacking lies in its intent and rhythm. Both games celebrate care--the gentle act of restoring balance rather than conquering or competing. Watching green grass spread across cracked earth feels every bit as satisfying as unwrapping a cherished memento from a moving box.\n\nIt’s a thoughtful, hopeful game that turns environmental restoration into art. When you finally pack up your machines and leave behind a thriving wilderness, you’ll feel the same quiet fulfillment that Unpacking delivers.",

In 2018, when she was 15, Tretta was shot in the abdomen during a shooting at Saugus High School in Santa Clarita, California, that killed two students murdered and injured two others. Then, over the weekend, she was one of hundreds of Brown students, faculty, and staff who were traumatized by a gunman whose spree left two dead and nine injured.\n\nAs Tretta told Spectrum News, “No one should ever have to go through one shooting, let alone two. She added, “I chose Brown, a place that I love, because it felt like somewhere I could finally be safe and finally, you know, be normal in this new normal that I live of a school shooting survivor. And it’s happened again.”\n\nIt would be a mistake to simply think of Tretta as particularly unlucky. In fact, she belongs to a growing community of US residents who have survived more than one mass shooting. She’s not even the only Brown student in this disturbing category.\n\nIn 2018, when she was 12 years old, Zoe Weissman was a student at Westglade Middle School, which is adjacent to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. A shooting at the high school resulted in 17 dead and 18 injured. Another Parkland survivor would be further traumatized by a mass shooting at Florida State University.\n\nWhen I was 11, I told myself I’d never go through a school shooting. When I was 12, I told myself it would never happen again. Now I’m freshly 20, and I’ve once more been proven wrong. First Parkland, now Brown University. My safe haven away from my trauma.\n\nRight-wing media influencer Nick Sortor, who has participated in a White House propaganda event on the putative dangers of left-wing extremism, challenged Weissman by asking how she could have been in high school at age 12. Sortor didn’t do the elementary research needed to discover that Weissman’s middle school was affected by the Parkland massacre.\n\nSortor is obviously a bad-faith actor, but he’s trying to exploit a wider ignorance of how pervasive mass shootings are—and how many times the same people survive multiple sprees.\n\nSome Michigan State University students who survived Monday’s mass shooting—and their parents—had already been through a similar, horrific experience.\n\n“(Fourteen) months ago I had to evacuate from Oxford High School when a fifteen year old opened fire and killed four of my classmates and injured seven more. Tonight, I am sitting under my desk at Michigan State University, once again texting everyone ‘I love you,’” Emma Riddle, a freshman studying history at the university tweeted overnight Monday. “When will this end?”\n\nThe BBC has also reported on other cases of people surviving more than one mass shooting. As the BBC notes, “For those who have witnessed more than one instance of gun violence in their lifetime, there comes an even greater risk for serious mental health issues like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.”\n\nMass shootings can happen anywhere, as the horrific antisemitic attack at Australia’s Bondi Beach that left 16 dead and 42 injured this weekend shows. But it is a simple fact that they happen with particular frequency in the United States thanks to the ready availability of guns. As the American Journal of Public Health documented in 2017, “Mass shootings occur worldwide but are a particular problem in the United States. Despite being home to only 5% of the world’s population, roughly 31% of the world’s mass shootings have occurred in the United States. As of 2015, a mass shooting resulting in the death of four or more people occurred approximately every 12.5 days.”\n\nThe testimonies of Mia Tretta and Zoe Weissman help illuminate how pervasive and damaging American gun culture is. They are survivors turned activists who have used their experience to advocate for gun control, but their fundamental optimism has been betrayed by a gridlocked political system that refuses to tackle this problem. With their youthful faith in a better world, these students hoped to find a haven in Brown University. What they’ve learned instead is that contemporary America provides no real respite for the traumatized. The fact that they’ve had to experience the horrors of mass shootings twice while still very young is as stark a condemnation of the status quo as one could make.\n\nOver the past year you’ve read Nation writers like Elie Mystal, Kaveh Akbar, John Nichols, Joan Walsh, Bryce Covert, Dave Zirin, Jeet Heer, Michael T.

    "fullText": "Dec. 15 (UPI) -- J.J. McCarthy threw for 250 yards and two scores to help the Minnesota Vikings put the Dallas Cowboys on the brink of playoff elimination.\n\nThe second-year quarterback completed 15 of 24 passes and also ran for a touchdown in the 34-26 triumph Sunday in Arlington, Texas.\n\nThe Cowboys outgained the Vikings 423-327 in total yards and held a five-minute edge in time of possession, but missed two field goals and failed to secure points on three of their five red-zone opportunities.\n\n\"I'm proud of our team,\" Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell told reporters. \"It's the first time all year we've been able to stack a couple wins together. We knew it would be very, very difficult.\"\n\n: @SNFonNBC pic.twitter.com/pKkcz7rYi2— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) December 15, 2025\n\nO'Connell said the Vikings' goal was to get off to a fast start, but it was their foes who found the end zone first Sunday night at AT&T Stadium. Cowboys defensive tackle Quinnen Williams intercepted McCarthy's first pass of the night. Running back Javonte Williams found the end zone with a 1-yard run to end the resulting drive.\n\nThe Vikings tied the score when McCarthy connected with Jalen Nailor on a 20-yard touchdown pass about six minutes later. The Cowboys and Vikings exchanged blows for the remainder of the half, and the score was tied 17-17 at the break.\n\nPro Bowl kicker Brandon Aubrey made field goals on the Cowboys' first two drives of the second half for a 23-17 advantage. The Vikings responded with an eight-play, 73-yard scoring drive, which ended with a 1-yard run from fullback C.J. Ham.\n\nMcCarthy connected with Nailor for a second touchdown -- this one from 4 yards out -- about 5:48 into the fourth quarter for a 31-23 advantage and the Vikings never trailed again.\n\nVikings kicker Will Reichard made a 53-yard field goal with about a minute remaining. Aubrey, who missed 51- and 59-yard field goals earlier in the game, split the uprights from 41 yards out on the next drive to cut into the deficit. The Cowboys then failed to recover an onside kick, ending their hopes of a rally.\n\nPrescott completed 23 of 38 passes for 294 yards in the loss. Star wide receiver CeeDee Lamb caught six passes for 111 yards. Williams picked up 91 yards and a score on 15 carries. Fellow Cowboys running back Malik Hooker totaled 37 yards from scrimmage and a score on 10 touches.\n\nAubrey made 4 of 6 field goal attempts, with successful kicks from 37 and 26 yards, in addition to two 41-yard conversions.\n\nTight end T.J. Hockenson and wide receiver Jordan Addison totaled 66 receiving yards apiece for the Vikings. Jones totaled 65 yards from scrimmage on 15 touches in the Victory.\n\n: @SNFonNBC pic.twitter.com/q40LRbnKjO— Minnesota Vikings (@Vikings) December 15, 2025\n\nThe Cowboys (6-7-1), who were 3-5-1 through nine weeks, but rallied to reach playoff contention, can officially be eliminated Saturday if the Philadelphia Eagles (9-5) beat the Washington Commanders (4-10).\n\n\"We are professional football players,\" Prescott said. \"You've gotta come to work and give your absolute best, regardless. Unfortunately, I'm sure the playoffs are out of the picture. But it's about taking pride in who you are as a man and your job and everything that's gotten you to this point.\"\n\nPrescott and the Cowboys will host the Los Angeles Chargers (10-4) at 1 p.m. EST Sunday in Arlington, Texas. The Vikings (6-8) will face the New York Giants at 1 p.m. Sunday in East Rutherford, N.J.",

    "description": "The Packers made a blockbuster trade for former Cowboys defensive superstar Micah Parsons with winning the Super Bowl most in mind. Do they have enough talent without him to make a deep playoff run? The answer is no.",
    "fullText": "Micah Parsons’ injury impact: Why Packers won't win Super Bowl 60 without star edge rusher originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers are one of several strong Super Bowl contenders from the NFC, even after Sunday's tough inter-conference loss at Denver, dropping them to 9-4-1 and the No. 7 seed. But they suffered a much more significant loss in the game with edge rusher Micah Parsons going down with what is feared to be a torn ACL.\n\nThe likely devastating knee injury means the Packers, as either NFC North champions or a wild-card team, won't have Parsons for the playoffs. Not only did he produce 12.5 sacks in 14 games, he has been terrific with his consistent pressure on quarterbacks. He also was better than expected against the run with the arguable best season in his career.\n\nUnfortunately, the Packers also weren't immune to the injury bug that bit Parsons in his final of four seasons with the Cowboys in 2024, only they probably won't be getting him back. Here's a look at whether Green Bay's defense or team as a whole is still capable of making a winning run through Super Bowl 60 without him:\n\nMORE: Micah Parsons injury update\n\nThough 14 games, the Packers as a team have 33 sacks, recording none against Bo Nix and the Broncos in their 34-26 loss in Week 15. Without Parsons at right defensive end, the healthy leading pass rusher is fellow starting end Rashan Gary, with 8.5. Gary has had a disappointing season and much of his production stems from the blocking attention on Parsons.\n\nDefensive tackle Devonte Wyatt is third on the team with 4 sacks, but he's also out for the season with an ankle injury. Backup end Kingsley Engabare, who also has been ineffective as a situational passer rusher has only 2 sacks to land fourth. He and Lukas Van Ness (only 1.5 sacks) will be pressed into more action to support Gary.\n\nThe Packers putting no heat on the Broncos' offensive line even before Parsons got hurt isn't a good sign. Green Bay remains a solid run defense, but now it is a missing the most important piece in trying to close out opponents in the second half.\n\nGreen Bay hasn't been giving Parsons much real support in the pass rush, making it even more difficult to replace him this late in the season.\n\nMORE: Latest updates, recovery time on Micah Parsons after left knee injury\n\nThe NFC is a top-heavy conference. There are lot of explosive passing games, led by the Rams and Matthew Stafford. The Bears, Eagles, Buccaneers, Seahawks and 49ers, the rest of the playoff-positioned teams ahead of Packers, also would get a huge break in potential matchups.\n\nThe Packers' playoff track record with Matt LaFleur is already shaky. They have gone 3-5 under their head coach and haven't advanced to the NFC championship game in five years. Navigating this field of heavyweights will be tough, especially without any home games.\n\nThe good news is, finishing with the Bears, Ravens and Vikings give the Packers games they win without Parsons. Given Green Bay beat Chicago in Week 14, there's a fair chance it can rally to still take the NFC North and get as high as the No. 2 seed again.\n\nThe bad news is, it will still be tough to beat the now No. 2 Bears a second time and the team already has lost to the No. 3 Eagles. The Packers are trending to face either a tough team from the NFC West (Seahawks or 49ers) at home or getting a tough rematch on the road.\n\nWith the conference title race so tight, missing one key player can make the difference. Outside of quarterback Jordan Love, Parsons is the Packers' most indispensable player.\n\nGreen Bay's Super Bowl odds are now trending against them. No Parsons is that significant of a blow.",

Buchanan will undergo additional testing today to confirm the injury,\" Schefter reported.\n\nBuchanan suffered his injury in the first quarter and it was immediately clear that he had sustained a significant issue, as it was a non-contact injury.\n\n\"Teddye, we'll know tomorrow, but I don't think it looks good initially,\" head coach John Harbaugh said. \"We'll have to confirm that tomorrow.\"\n\nBuchanan, who had a strong first season in the NFL, finishes his rookie campaign with 93 tackles, which ranks second on the team. He also added 0.5 sacks, two QB hits, one pass defensed and one forced fumble.\n\nBuchanan also thrived in run defense, with the rookie posting a Pro Football Focus grade of 69.8 in that area, which ranked 37th out of 88th among linebackers.\n\nAs far as Buchanan's outlook for 2026 goes, he is going to be in danger of not being ready for the start of the season, as the recovery time for a torn ACL can take nine months, which means he might not be cleared until September.\n\nMeanwhile, the Ravens' defense loses one of its better players and that is going to seriously impact Baltimore's playoff push over the final three weeks.\n\nCan Cowboys still make the playoffs after Week 15 loss to Vikings?\n\nDavante Adams injury update from Rams leaves Week 16 status in doubt\n\nPackers' Micah Parsons feared to have season-ending injury\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury diagnosis is worst-case scenario for Chiefs\n\nPatrick Mahomes makes first public comment since knee injury",

Any quicker than that feels bold to predict at this point.\n\nAnd if the Chiefs plan on not having Mahomes by Week 1, or for an early portion of the 2026 season, it raises an interesting point:\n\nWho will be Kansas City's QB until Mahomes gets back?\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nGardner Minshew is the current backup, and he's on a one-year contract.

    "fullText": "James Garner is ready to embrace the additional responsibility of leading the Everton midfield in Idrissa Gana Gueye and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall’s absence.\n\nGana Gueye, along with teammate Iliman Ndiaye, have departed to join the Senegal national team camp for the upcoming Africa Cup of Nations tournament in Morocco. They’re set to play their opening contest on December 23 against Botswana.\n\nMeanwhile, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall suffered a hamstring issue on his return to Stamford Bridge, a game the Toffees lost 2-0.\n\nGarner is enjoying a great season so far and he has played most of his matches at the heart of the Everton midfield, partnering Gana, while Dewsbury-Hall has played as a number 10. However, the Birkenhead-born player has also shown his versatility on several occasions and has also been utilised as a fullback on either flank by David Moyes.\n\nDiscussing stepping up to fill the void of his teammates after the Toffees' frustrating 2-0 defeat to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, Garner said, \"I think [playing as a senior midfielder] comes quite naturally, to be fair.\n\n\"I'm quite a quiet leader. I've been captain pretty much every single place I've been at, coming through the youth teams, so it comes quite naturally to me.\n\n\"Hopefully, I can bring the lads along and whoever I end up playing with in midfield, I'm sure I can help them and they can help me.\n\n\"We just want to keep picking up three points and keep on climbing the table.\"\n\nDespite suffering a loss at Stamford Bridge, a ground Everton haven’t won in since 1994, there were positives to take from the display. The Blues had several chances to claw their way back into the game but failed to capitalise on them.\n\nThey also recorded more final third entries (58 to 44), completed more passes in the attacking third than Enzo Maresca's side (117 to 110), and won more duels (55 per cent) on the day – but couldn't find a way breakthrough in west London.\n\nDavid Moyes’ side registered 11 shots on goal in total, with Iliman Ndiaye coming the closest, hitting the far post late in the game.\n\n\"One-thousand per cent [it shows the progress that's being made],\" Garner continued. \"I think we've come on leaps and bounds.\n\n\"Maybe a year or two ago, we come here and we sit back and we have 20-30 per cent of the ball, whereas today we play against one of the best teams in the league, in the Champions League and we have a large spell on the ball and I think we were a better team for large parts of the game.\n\n\"But being the better team doesn't get you three points, at the end of the day – they were clinical in both boxes and we weren't.\n\n\"That's the end story of the game, but definitely there are a lot of positives to take and we just need to pick ourselves up now and go again.\"\n\nEngland head coach Thomas Tuchel was in attendance at Stamford Bridge. Garner, who has received the backing of Moyes to make his maiden England appearance sooner rather than later, added, \"I hope so, yes. That is the plan but, at the same time, I'm not too focused on it.\n\n\"I'm just trying to be my best every single weekend and get three points for the team. If that means me hopefully getting a call-up one day, I'll be really happy.\"",

    "fullText": "2025 was a great year for former UFC contender Darren Till, and “The Gorilla” is hoping for an even bigger 2206.\n\nAfter a tough stretch that saw him lose to Robert Whittaker, Derek Brunson, and Dricus Du Plessis, Darren Till requested his release from the UFC and actually got it. His plan, at the time, was to heal up, make some money outside the promotion, and return.\n\nThat didn’t really work out too well — Till packed on the pounds, seemed unable to book a fight, and found out the UFC exit door had lock shut behind him. A ridiculous sham of a fight against Mohammad Mutie in Dubai was all Till had to show after two years outside the promotion. But something changed in 2025: Misfits Boxing picked the Liverpudlian up and kept him busy, fighting him three times.\n\nAnd Till won all three, including an impressive third round KO of Luke Rockhold in August.\n\nDARREN TILL VIOLENTLY SLUMPS LUKE ROCKHOLD\n\n pic.twitter.com/iZrAEB02kg\n\n— 🌴ᴛʜᴇᴀʀᴛᴏꜰᴡᴀʀ🌴 (@TheArtOfWar6) August 30, 2025\n\nNow Till is hoping to build on that momentum. Speaking to Bloody Elbow at the IBA Elite Mens World Championships in Dubai, he shared big names for the upcoming year.\n\n“I’d love my rematch with Masvidal,” Till said. “I’d love to knock him out because he knocked me out and then we could probably go for the trilogy. It’s the same with [Tyron] Woodley, he submitted me. So I’d love them two fights.”\n\nTill was on an impressive 18 fight win streak (5 in the UFC) when he faced Tyron Woodley in a 2018 welterweight title fight. “T-Wood” would submit him four minutes into the second round, ending Till’s quest for UFC championship gold. Darren’s next fight was even rougher: Jorge Masvidal sparked Till, KOing him badly in the second round of their UFC London main event.\n\n“But then Nate Diaz is also available,” Till added. “He’s probably the biggest fight out of the three I’d love that. Let’s see where it goes, because I’d love the Nate fight as well.”\n\nDiaz was in talks to fight Till in 2025 before Luke Rockhold stepped in as an opponent instead. Nate is currently saying he wants to fight Paddy Pimblett next … which just isn’t realistic. What is realistic? Darren Till. And we gotta hand it to “The Gorilla” — his whole list of potential opponents are realistic options, and interesting match-ups. What a change one year can make!",

    "fullText": "Cardiff City boss Brian Barry-Murphy sounds like he is well and truly up for this game against Chelsea tomorrow night.\n\nIt might be a good time to play against Chelsea. However, it could also be a pretty bad time to face them. It all depends how Enzo Maresca and his players react after the circus of the last 24 hours.\n\nMaresca put the spotlight firmly on himself by saying some wild comments after The Blues beat Everton 2-0 in the Premier League on Saturday.\n\nHe started talking about how difficult the last 48 hours had been for him, due to a lack of support. Insider Ben Jacobs had some thoughts on who his comments were aimed at, but it’s clear that the comments were made towards his bosses and employers at the club.\n\nFormer Arsenal star Perry Groves gave his view on the comments and says that Maresca is taking on a fight that he cannot win by saying those things. It’s not great.\n\nFair play to Maresca for coming out and saying these things is what I think. But maybe it could have some kind of effect on tomorrow.\n\nEnzo Maresca on the touchline against Leeds.. (Photo by Shaun Botterill/Getty Images)\n\n“The anticipation for the game ever since the draw was made has been evident everywhere we’ve been,” Brian began as reported on Cardiff’s website. “Luckily we’ve tried to detach ourselves from that as much as possible whilst focusing on the league campaign, but now that it’s here, I think that the game is going to be incredibly exciting for everyone.\n\n“For myself and the players we still want to show ourselves in the best light and give a good account of ourselves when competing against a side who are the Club World Cup champions. We want to do our best and prepare properly for this game.\n\n“It’s everything you want. We all have aspirations of testing ourselves against those at the highest level of the game.\n\n“Whether we get there or not is unpredictable and not always clear, so this is a chance for us to see what it looks like and to give it absolutely everything, understand the level of opponent we’re facing and respecting it completely, but not being intimidated by that, and to give it a go as much as we can and see where it takes us.”\n\nHe concluded: “In every game each team poses different challenges and a team of this calibre is clearly going to have the ball for spells of the game, and we have to show the different facets of our game to be in the right shape to compete with them.\n\n“That’s something we can do; we have good players ourselves and tomorrow night is about trying to show that as much as possible.”",

Powell brings a coveted combination of strong defense and a scoring punch, while providing the ability to play multiple positions at 6'6\".\n\nSaturday was the breakout game Powell so long coveted as a Tar Heel, tying his career-high with 17 points in an 80-62 win. Powell drained six of his nine shot attempts, including three perimeter makes, plus two free throws.\n\nPowell spoke on his big game after Saturday's win, pointing to his constant work between games and always ready to be called upon.\n\n\"If it’s an off day, good day, I know the work that I put in every day after practice, before practice, late at night,\" Powell said. \"So really just coming (into games) with the same mindset, confidence each game of staying ready, go out there and play my game. I’m going to do whatever it takes to help my team win. I’m glad I was able to help them today.\"\n\nPowell was one of four Tar Heels scoring in double-figures, joining Caleb Wilson (20 points), Luka Bogavac (15) and Henri Veesaar (14). Seth Trimble is expected back from injury soon – and will likely take minutes from Powell – but the latter proved his case for starts going forward.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC's Jonathan Powell points to constant work for breakout on Saturday",

    "title": "Ranking LSU football's top five transfers of 2025",
    "description": "LSU football's transfer class arrived with high expectations. Not all worked out, but there were a few standouts. Here are the top five.",
    "fullText": "LSU football signed the top-ranked transfer portal class in college football, according to 247Sports. LSU spent a lot of money on some prized additions and it led to LSU begining the year ranked in the top-10 with championship expectations.\n\nLSU began the year 4-0 and climbed into the top five. It looked like LSU's transfer class was paying off, at least on defense. But issues persisted on offense, where LSU's transfers weren't clicking at wide receiver and the additions on the offensive line weren't enough, either.\n\nLSU lost to Ole Miss and LSU began to tumble. LSU started losing and head coach Brian Kelly was fired. It was Kelly's most talented LSU roster, but with the talent came expectations. LSU fell short of those lofty standards.\n\nBut the transfer class wasn't a complete bust. Several newcomers weren't significant difference makers on defense. Here are LSU's top five transfers of 2025.\n\nPatrick Payton transferred to LSU after spending four years at Florida State. Payton was one of the most experienced players in the portal and ESPN viewed Payton as one of the top players in the transfer class. Payton played a role in FSU's undefeated regular season in 2023, but struggled in 2024. LSU didn't know which version of Payton it would get.\n\nThe Tigers got something closer to the 2023 version of Payton. The veteran was a productive edge defender, getting after the passer and stopping the run. Payton finished the regular season with 23 pressures and 16 stops. His full impact can't be captured on the stat sheet, though. Payton's physicality vs the run allowed LSU DC Blake Baker to be flexible with his run fits.\n\nPayton was active in opposing backfields, often forcing the ball to another LSU defender to make the stop. Payton boosted his draft stock in Baton Rouge.\n\nDefensive end was a big need for LSU in the portal last year. The Tigers practically had no returning production at the position, making veteran defensive ends a priority. Along with Payton, LSU signed Jack Pyburn from Florida.\n\nMany of the same things I said about Payton can be said about Pyburn. He was impactful vs the run and pass, pressuring the QB 31 times while making 24 stops.\n\nPyburn brought physicality and leadership to a defensive front that needed it. Pyburn finished the regular season on a high note, with nine pressures over his final three games.\n\nGooden was a late addition to LSU's transfer class, signing with the Tigers in late April. He turned into one of the best interior pass rushers in the SEC, racking up 23 pressures. That ranked No. 5 among defensive tackles in the conference.\n\nGooden was disruptive vs. the run, making 11 stops. Gooden didn't have the size of other elite defensive tackles in the SEC, but it's rare to see a defensive lineman with his level of explosiveness. Gooden has another year of eligibility, but he's likely off to the NFL after a productive 2025.\n\nLike Gooden, Haulcy was another spring transfer portal addition and he proved to be a needed one. LSU's safety position was a problem for several years leading up to 2025 -- that made the position a major need in the portal. When Haulcy entered in April, he was too good to pass up.\n\nPer PFF, Haulcy finished the regular season as the No. 2 graded safety in the SEC, only trailing Texas' Michael Taffe. Haulcy was elite in coverage, breaking up four passes and earning a 58.6 NFL passer rating when targeted.\n\nFew safeties played as much man as Haulcy did, which opened up the entire playbook for Baker's defense.\n\nThis one was easy. Delane wasn't just LSU's best transfer -- he was one of the best in the country. The LSU cornerback was a finalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, annually given to the best defensive back in the country.\n\nLSU wanted Delane because the Tigers needed a proven veteran at cornerback. Delane exceeded all expectations and played himself into the first round of the NFL Draft.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Ranking LSU football's top five transfer portal additions of 2025",

Well if you do please consider signing any of the 10 oldest free agents to contracts with the money you can spare.\n\nLevel of interest can never be known for sure, but at the very least the San Francisco Giants have checked in on former Dodger and current free agent Cody Bellinger.\n\nThe Red Sox, the Yankees, and the Orioles are engaged in an AL East battle for the services of free agent starter Michael King, who hopes to make his decision soon.\n\nDespite some rumors over the weekend, Tyler Glasnow isn’t going to be leaving Los Angeles or the Dodgers rotation any time soon.\n\nRangers General Manager and Old Friend Chris Young made it very clear that Texas has no intentions of shopping or trading Corey Seager.\n\nChris McShane was kind enough to introduce all of us to the newest Met: Jorge Polanco.\n\nOn this date 21 years ago, Pedro Martinez officially became a New York Met.",

In addition to multiple appearances on \"WWE Raw\" Nikki has competed at several Premium Live Events, but her recent run has seemingly led her sister, Brie Bella, to consider stepping back inside the squared circle as well. Last month, The Bella Twins turned 42-years-old, and while discussing their birthday wishes on their podcast, Brie shared that she's been hoping to join her sister for one last ride with WWE.\n\n\"I think there is definitely a last run in me, and I'm at the age and I'm strong and I think it's cause I'm working out so hard and I'm feeling good. But I'm like, there's for sure a last run in me,\" she explained on \"The Nikki & Brie Show.\" \"Wherever it may take me, wherever it may be, I hope it's with you. Wherever that is at, who knows, whether it's for one night or 200 nights. We'll see.\"\n\nAs for Nikki, she wished that she will become the Women's World Champion in the near future, but together both sisters hope they can have the opportunity to win the Women's Tag Team Championships before they retire. Nikki recently challenged for the world championship at Survivor Series when she went one-on-one with Stephanie Vaquer for the title, but she was defeated by the \"Dark Angel\" after 12 minutes of in-ring action.\n\nIf you use any of the quotes in this article, please credit \"The Nikki & Brie Show\" with a h/t to Wrestling Inc. for the transcription.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAfter years of dominance, the 2025 season has not been good for the Kansas City Chiefs, by multiple points of view. In Week 15, it all came crashing down.\n\nNot only were the Chiefs ruled out of playoff contention as they dropped to 6-8, but late in the fourth quarter of their loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, star quarterback Patrick Mahomes went down with an injury that was later diagnosed as a torn ACL.\n\nFrom the start, it appeared to be a knee injury for Mahomes, who then limped back to the locker room with trainers. Postgame, head coach Andy Reid said the injury “didn’t look good,\" leaving some worry for the potential worst-case scenario that was later confirmed: a torn ACL.\n\nHere's the latest on Mahomes' injury, as well as a breakdown of how ACL injuries have impacted players' recovery in the past.\n\nSix reasons why the Chiefs never got over Super Bowl hangover\n\nPatrick Mahomes suffers knee injury on final drive of Chiefs-Chargers\n\nChiefs officially eliminated from NFL playoffs with loss to Chargers\n\nHow long Chiefs are expected to be without Patrick Mahomes after knee injury\n\nFollowing testing, Mahomes was officially diagnosed with a torn ACL on Sunday night, per ESPN's Adam Schefter.\n\n\"An MRI has confirmed that Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes sustained a torn ACL in his left knee in today’s game,\" the Chiefs said in a statement. \"Patrick and the club are currently exploring surgical options.\"\n\nMahomes also shared a message to fans on social media.\n\n\"Don’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie [it] hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again,\" Mahomes wrote. \"Thank you Chiefs kingdom for always supporting me and for everyone who has reached out and sent prayers. I Will be back stronger than ever.\"\n\nDon’t know why this had to happen. And not going to lie it’s hurts. But all we can do now is Trust in God and attack every single day over and over again.

I Will be back…\n\n— Patrick Mahomes II (@PatrickMahomes) December 14, 2025\n\nAfter Week 15,Andy Reid said he was set to undergo an MRI to determine the severity and that it “didn’t look good.”\n\nIn the fourth quarter against the Chargers, Mahomes was tackled to the ground, and in the process, he had his leg get pulled on a bit while caught under his defender.\n\nHe remained on the ground in pain, grabbing at his left knee.\n\nJust a rough season for the Chiefs😔 pic.twitter.com/sP3PPRQWLe\n\n— The Sporting News (@sportingnews) December 14, 2025\n\nThis is what happened to Patrick Mahomes: pic.twitter.com/T5xlU5Vl6Whttps://t.co/fL5JyHmkW7\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) December 14, 2025\n\nMahomes was then helped back to the locker room, before tests confirmed his torn ACL.\n\nPatrick Mahomes was helped to the locker room after leaving the field.\n\n(📺 CBS) pic.twitter.com/mPvjdlMZRJ\n\n— SportsCenter (@SportsCenter) December 14, 2025\n\nThe recovery time for ACL injuries in the NFL is dependent on the severity. Mahomes' is considered fully torn, per the Chiefs, but his official timetable for recovery has not yet been revealed.\n\nBecause ACLs are responsible for many rapid movements, especially in football, the average recovery time can be anywhere from 6-12 months in the NFL, with a wide range based on the extent of the tear, whether not surgery is required, the player's age, and plenty more.\n\nPer Bass Medical Group, a torn ACL that requires surgery and rehab typically carries an 8-12 month recovery timeline in the NFL. Meanwhile, a mild MCL sprain is a 2-6 week recovery, and a complete MCL rupture is 3-6 months.\n\nThe severity of a torn ACL is determined in a grading system, like some other injuries.\n\nThe least severe type of ACL injury is a Grade 1 ailment, which means the ligament was stretched but is still intact. In this case, someone may have some mild pain and swelling, but it would not require surgery.\n\nA Grade 2 ACL tear means the ligament is loose, or partially torn. Surgery may depend on the severity of the injury, as it can sometimes heal non-surgically.\n\nThe worst-case scenario with ACL injuries is a complete tear, which is a Grade 3. The ligament is in two pieces, leading to knee instability and more severe pain. This often requires surgery to repair.\n\nIn the 2025 season alone, recent NFL players to be diagnosed with torn ACLs, in some capacity, include New York Giants wide receiver Malik Nabers, Washington Commanders tight end Zach Ertz and Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Penix Jr.\n\nNabers' injury came in September, and an MRI confirmed a season-ending torn ACL. He is expected to return by the start of the 2026 season.\n\nErtz's injury was more recent, as he took a big hit in Week 14 that resulted in a torn ACL diagnosis. It's unknown whether the veteran tight end will retire, but he likely wouldn't be able to return until mid-way through the 2026 season.\n\nPenix partially tore his ACL, so his was not as severe as Nabers' or Ertz's. Per ESPN, Penix underwent surgery to have his ACL reconstructed in November with a nine-month recovery period expected, with hopes that he's ready for the start of the 2026 season.",

    "description": "Detroit Lions fans and analysts alike sounded off after many thought Colby Parkinson was down at the 1-yard line.",
    "fullText": "Many fans were left disgruntled over yet another controversial call in a Detroit Lions game.\n\nIn the Lions’ 41-34 loss to the Rams in Los Angeles on Sunday afternoon, every single point mattered. So when a controversial touchdown call late in the third quarter popped up, many were quick to cry foul.\n\nRams tight end Colby Parkinson looked to be down at the 1-yard line, but it was ruled a 26-yard touchdown, even after review. That gave the Rams a 27-24 lead, that would, in part, ultimately lead to Detroit’s loss. FOX rules analyst Dean Blandino tried to explain the thought process behind the call, but he’s clearly not buying it.\n\n“What they ruled is that Parkinson lost control and regained possession in the end zone—he had already broken the plane,” he said. “To me, that’s a stretch. Look, it was ruled a catch, he’s clearly down, that should be down at the 1. I can’t see how we’re keeping that touchdown.”\n\nRules Analyst @DeanBlandino takes us through this call that was ultimately ruled a touchdown for the Rams ⬇️ pic.twitter.com/blmIKtRds0\n\n— FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) December 14, 2025\n\nBut they did keep that touchdown. Normally today I’d put together a “best reactions to the Lions win” article, but instead we’ll take a look at some of the reactions to this controversial call. Well, I tried to find some Rams fans with solid arguments for why it was a TD, but didn’t find nearly anything, so how controversial can the call be.\n\nHUH???

    "description": "Maresca caused a stir when making the comments after Chelsea’s win over Everton and was quizzed on them again before Tuesday’s clash with Cardiff",
    "fullText": "Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca remained defiant over his bombshell comments that he had suffered his “worst 48 hours” at the club when asked to clarify the confusing sentiment.\n\nMaresca caused a stir over the weekend when, following Chelsea’s routine 2-0 victory over Everton, he used his post-match press conference to claim out of the blue that he had endured a torrid few days.\n\nHaving given not even the slightest hint of an issue during his pre-match press conference, which took place at the heart of the supposed 48-hour storm – shortly after a 2-1 Champions League loss to Atalanta – Maresca responded to a benign question about Malo Gusto’s impressive performance against the Toffees by hitting out.\n\n“The last 48 hours have been the worst 48 hours since I joined the club because so many people didn’t support us,” he insisted, leading to speculation he was referencing the club’s ownership or sporting directors.\n\nHe went on to reiterate the point but refused to elaborate on who he was specifically talking about, simply stating “many people” and when asked whether it was an internal issue, responding that it was people “in general”.\n\nWhen asked if it referred to the fans, the Italian only said, “I love the fans and we are very happy with the fans”.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, in his pre-match press conference ahead of Chelsea’s Carabao Cup quarter-final against League One side Cardiff City on Tuesday, Maresca was inevitably asked to expand on his explosive comments.\n\nHowever, the 45-year-old was defiant and refused to explain or address the situation.\n\n“I already spoke about that and I don’t have nothing to add,” said Maresca. “It’s Cardiff tomorrow, please. I already spoke about that and I think I was quite clear. No more than that.”\n\nWhen asked again, the Chelsea boss added: “I respect your opinion and I respect people's opinion but again I have nothing to add. My focus is on tomorrow’s game and that we can achieve the third semi-final in 18 months since I joined the club.”\n\nPushed again, he said: “We are in an era where everyone can say what they think. My focus is on tomorrow. I already answered the question and my focus is on tomorrow. I don't have nothing to add.”\n\nMaresca was then asked whether he had explained what he meant to people at the club, to which he reiterated he “already spoke about that” and didn’t “need to add more things”.\n\nHe was also questioned as to whether he was happy with people saying he has a bad relationship with club’s owners or sporting directors and turned his answer to the fans.\n\n“I said after the game that I love Chelsea supporters – they deserve the best,” Maresca insisted. “Again, I don't have nothing to add.\n\n“I can speak Italian, my language, Spanish very well, French, English, I think I was clear with what I said. It’s done, it’s finished. It was after the game, I said what I said, and it’s done. It’s finished. Now, Cardiff. We need to move forward because tomorrow we have Cardiff.”\n\nMaresca did confirm that he was “absolutely” committed to being Chelsea head coach and was keen to maintain a winning mentality with a semi-final place in the Carabao Cup at stake.\n\n“Since I joined the club, I always tried to say the same; building a winning mentality by winning games,” added Maresca. “Tomorrow is another chance to be in another semi-final and it's an important moment for everyone at the club.\n\n“I think we are in the right direction. There are some moments where we dropped some points but it is part of the journey. I have the feeling we are getting better and better.”\n\nMaresca was keen to stress that the Blues would not be taking Cardiff, who are four points clear atop the League One table, lightly but that he would employ some squad rotation, with talisman Cole Palmer not fit enough to play again so soon after Saturday’s clash with Everton.\n\n“We are going to make some changes,” he confirmed. “We will see how many but for sure, we need some players to recover the energy.\n\n“I already said many times, Cole is one of the players that deserves to be protected. He is not available to play two games in three days.”",

    "fullText": "It was a shock this summer when promising freshman Tabitha Betson announced she would be returning to Australia to pursue professional basketball.\n\nColorado had recruited her out of IMG Academy and was one of two freshman, alongside Kennedy Sanders, JR Payne trusted with a rotation spot.\n\nBetson, a 6’2 playmaking forward, took some time to adjust to college ball but her talent popped on the court. She could score from all three levels, played strong inside and was clearly educated in basketball, with a strong positional sense and a good feel for the game.\n\nCU fans were happy to have such a well-rounded player to build around in the coming years.\n\nBetson’s departure seemed more personal than anything else. She’d been abroad for over five years, playing high school ball in Florida and college here, and wanted to be back home for some time.\n\nShe’s now back in Boulder, announcing Saturday on Instagram:\n\nIt’s unclear when exactly Betson will rejoin the Colorado rotation. She may need time to get back into the speed of things, catch up with an almost entirely new roster — only Sanders, Jade Masogayo and JoJo Nworie return from last season — and earn her place on a much improved team.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s Kobbie Mainoo’s last year at Old Trafford has been far from plain sailing.\n\nThe Carrington graduate was massively important under Erik ten Hag and even broke into the England national team’s starting eleven.\n\nNonetheless, since Ruben Amorim has come to the club, Mainoo has seen his minutes dramatically reduced.\n\nMainoo has only played 10 matches in the Premier League and has failed to start any of them. What’s more, he has only been on the pitch for a combined 183 minutes.\n\nNaturally, Mainoo is far from content with the situation and was denied a loan move at the end of August.\n\nThe lack of minutes has only fuelled further talk of an exit, with Serie A champions SSC Napoli and Spanish giants Real Madrid and FC Barcelona both seemingly interested in the midfielder.\n\nThe manager’s lack of trust in the fan favourite is clear for all to see. This was evident when Mainoo was given a hero’s welcome last Monday when he came off the bench versus Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nAmorim has defended his decision to stick with Casemiro and Bruno Fernandes, but it seems that now it is more than just the fans questioning the Portuguese manager’s thought process on the matter.\n\nThe Telegraph reports that, “Mainoo’s exasperation over his current situation at Old Trafford barely needs stating. He feels frozen out by a manager who has yet to start him in a Premier League game this season and wants to leave on loan next month in pursuit of regular playing time.”\n\nInterestingly, the paper notes that, “there are figures within the club who are very uneasy about the player’s predicament and what a potential exit could signify.”\n\nWhilst Amorim has insisted that there is a route back for Mainoo, not many would believe him considering Mainoo’s lack of minutes in spite of the club’s limited midfield options.\n\nIn addition, Manchester United have always prided themselves on their academy, and there will have been shudders down the spine of numerous fans after hearing Amorim’s comments on the likes of Harry Amass and Chido Obi in his pre-match press conference.\n\nMoreover, with Manchester United’s academy swarming with many talented starlets at the moment, none more obvious than JJ Gabriel, supporters and indeed the club will worry immensely over the cloud the Mainoo situation is casting over Old Trafford at the moment.\n\nFeatured image Shaun Botterill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The already fractured relationship between Real Madrid and Barcelona has sunk to a new low, and the ongoing Negreira case continues to widen the divide between Spain’s two biggest institutions.\n\nNow, according to a report from AS, Real Madrid are deeply angered by the behaviour of both La Liga and the Royal Spanish Football Federation (RFEF) during Barcelona president Joan Laporta’s recent appearance before the judge overseeing the Negreira investigation.\n\nIt is said that there is a growing sense that the football authorities have shown little appetite to seriously scrutinise Barcelona’s explanations.\n\nSources within the Madrid camp have voiced their frustration at what they view as deliberate inactivity.\n\nAs described by those close to the club, “Their passivity reflects their lack of interest in getting to the bottom of the matter.”\n\nThe report details how both La Liga and the RFEF were represented by legal counsel at the City of Justice in Barcelona, yet their involvement was minimal.\n\nBeatriz Seijo, a criminal law specialist appointed by RFEF president Rafael Louzan, chose not to pose a single question to Laporta.\n\nRelationship between Real Madrid and Barcelona is broken. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nMeanwhile, La Liga president Javier Tebas sent Francisco Martinez, who limited his intervention to one narrow query concerning whether Jose Maria Enriquez Negreira’s son had accompanied referees to the Camp Nou.\n\nThis restrained approach has further fuelled Madrid’s anger, even if it did not entirely surprise them.\n\nReal Madrid, meanwhile, are refusing to move on. The club has made it clear that it will continue to act as a private prosecutor until the judicial process reaches a definitive conclusion.\n\nThe investigation is focused on payments totalling €7.3 million made between 2011 and 2018 to Negreira and his son, Javier Enríquez, to determine whether these transactions were intended to influence refereeing decisions in Barcelona’s favour.\n\nDuring his testimony, Laporta firmly denied any wrongdoing, insisting that his side “was an example to the whole world” due to the quality of its football.\n\nNotably, he also defended the payments by stating that “the club received more than 600 technical reports” and argued that the arrangement predated his leadership, despite more than €1 million being paid during his presidency.",

    "description": "The Williams F1 junior is set to contest the 2026 Super Formula championship after a strong campaign in F2 this year",
    "fullText": "Williams Formula 1 junior Luke Browning says he “proved” himself enough to not need a second season in F2, as he prepares to switch to Super Formula next year.\n\nThe 23-year-old contested the Japanese championship’s post-season Suzuka test last week with the Toyota-powered Kondo Racing team, immediately after concluding his rookie F2 campaign where he finished fourth.\n\nRacing for Hitech, the Briton scored a single win in the feature race at Monza and was a regular podium visitor with nine overall, having also led the championship after the first five weekends.\n\nBrowning has therefore ruled out a second season in F2 due to a strong rookie campaign and he is all but confirmed for Super Formula in 2026 as he works towards an F1 graduation.\n\n“I think I proved myself in F2,” said the 2022 Aston Martin Autosport BRDC Young Driver of the Year winner. “I led the championship, had a pole position, and I won a race. We could have very easily won the championship had a few more things gone our way.\n\n“I think the decision to carry on and do a second year in F2 is made very early on in the season, as all the contracts are done so early. So at that point we made the decision not to do another year.\n\n“We could have won the championship, and then I wouldn't have been able to do another year anyway. So that was the reason for it.”\n\nBrowning participated in the second and third days of the Suzuka test, having been forced to skip the first day as he returned from his Abu Dhabi F1 test duties for Williams.\n\nDriving the #3 Kondo car on Thursday and then swapping with team-mate Jack Doohan to sample the #4 on Friday, Browning ended up with the fifth-fastest time on the rookies-only final day, 0.661 seconds slower than pacesetter Ugo Ugochukwu for TOM’S.\n\nUgo Ugochukwu tops Suzuka Super Formula test as Jack Doohan crashes three times\n\nSpeaking prior to the final session of the test, Browning said: “I think Ugo was on a different engine map, which meant he was faster in a straight line, so he was about 10km/h quicker than us.\n\n“We were not comparing [ourselves] to him, but compared to the other cars we did a great job today, so we're looking strong.”\n\nBrowning brushed off concerns regarding Kondo’s tough 2025 season, in which the team placed seventh overall with a single podium finish.\n\n“There's no shying away from the fact the team has had a tough year, but that doesn't mean that we're not going to have a great year going forward, if I am to come and race here, or that the car is not in a good place now,” said Browning.\n\n“Honestly, I don't know the full extent of what happened and why the team struggled more than they wanted to. But what I can say is, this year, we've got off to a flying start, and we're looking into all the data to try and improve going forward.”\n\nKondo defends ex-F1 racer Jack Doohan after three Super Formula test crashes\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "The Bills needed a win on Sunday to keep hope of winning the AFC East alive, but it didn't look like they'd get it when halftime came at Gillette Stadium.\n\nNew England scored on four of their five possessions in the first half and carried a 24-7 lead into halftime. Any thoughts of a prolonged celebration in the final 30 minutes ended with four straight touchdown drives that lifted the visiting team to a 35-31 win.\n\nQuarterback Josh Allen threw two of those touchdowns and said after the game that the collective belief in themselves was the reason why the Bills were able to end the day on the right side of the final score.\n\n\"I think it's the love each man in that locker room has for each other,\" Allen said, via a transcript from the Patriots. \"The willingness to put their body on the line in order to not let their teammates down. That driving force. It's the relationships in that room. And whether we are playing really good, whether we're playing really bad, this team is going to stick together and continue to fight and continue to find ways to win football games. I think we saw that tonight.\"\n\nThe Bills also needed to come back from being down 10 points at halftime in Week 14 and Allen said in his press conference that the Bills \"want to start faster\" in order to avoid the need for such heroics. He noted that it has made the team \"battle tested\" as they head toward the postseason and that could prove to be a vital factor as the Bills try to make it to the Super Bowl for the first time in Allen's career.",

    "fullText": "Chris Jones found out Chiefs were eliminated from playoffs in worst way possible originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs' streak of 10 straight playoff appearances came to an end on Sunday with the loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, but star defensive lineman Chris Jones had no idea.\n\nFollowing the loss to the Chargers on Sunday, Jones believed that Kansas City still had at least a slim hope to make the playoffs while addressing reporters.\n\nBut they informed him that was not the case.\n\n\"We still have a fighting chance,\" Jones said, per Rachel Hallam of KWCH12. \"Are we out of the playoffs?\"\n\n\"We are? OK,\" Jones replied when a reporter told him the Chiefs were eliminated.\n\nEven if the Chiefs were still in contention, they really wouldn't be.\n\nThat's because Kansas City lost superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a torn ACL, which ends his season.\n\nMahomes suffered the injury in the fourth quarter and had to leave the game early. It was immediately clear Mahomes had suffered a significant injury, as he was in obvious pain and was clutching at his knee.\n\nHe later had to be helped to the locker room in what was no doubt a sobering moment for Chiefs fans.\n\nWhile Jones will certainly be on the team with his monster contract that runs through 2028, there could be a lot of change in Kansas City next year.\n\nThe problem is that the Chiefs cannot buy their way back to the playoffs, with the team projected to be $43.7 million over the cap, so that makes things much more difficult.\n\nAnd, Kansas City now has to worry if its franchise star is even going to be ready by Week 1, with Mahomes facing what could be a nine-month recovery.\n\nCan Cowboys still make the playoffs after Week 15 loss to Vikings?\n\nDavante Adams injury update from Rams leaves Week 16 status in doubt\n\nPackers' Micah Parsons feared to have season-ending injury\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury diagnosis is worst-case scenario for Chiefs\n\nPatrick Mahomes makes first public comment since knee injury",

    "fullText": "Times change, and with them, so do the names who are playing at the highest levels of professional football. And this season, a 14-year streak will be broken in the AFC as a pair of familiar faces will both be missing from the conference's championship game for the first time since the 2010 season.\n\nOn Sunday, the Chiefs were defeated by the Chargers and, in combination with a Buffalo Bills win, were mathematically eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in over a decade. That's significant here because it means this season, the AFC Championship game will take place without either Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes or former New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady starting. That marks the first time since the 2010 season, when the two starting signal-callers were Ben Roethlisberger and Mark Sanchez.\n\nFrom the 2011-2017 seasons, Brady started for the Patriots in the AFC Championship game, winning four times to advance to the Super Bowl. In 2018, the Brady-led Patriots would square off with the Chiefs, who were under a first-year starter in Mahomes. The Patriots would go on to win that game 37-31 in overtime, and before winning Super Bowl LII over the Los Angeles Rams. The Patriots would fail to make the AFC Championship game the following season, which would be Brady's last with the franchise before he finished his career in Tampa Bay over three seasons.\n\nThe Chiefs, however, would not miss any more conference championship games for the foreseeable future, and from 2018-2024 made seven consecutive appearances in the AFC Championship, led by Mahomes, winning 5-of-6 from 2019-2024.\n\nBut one streak that can continue is the Patriots or Chiefs appearing in every AFC Championship game since the 2020 season, as Drake Maye has the Patriots at 11-3 and in prime position to be one of the top seeds in the AFC playoff bracket this season.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Touchdown Wire: Chiefs postseason elimination breaks 14-year old AFC Playoff streak",

Some of the same issues that Cleveland has been dealing with all season showed up in this loss, but there were a few key areas that contributed greatly to their defeat.\n\nShedeur Sanders threw three interceptions in this game. The turnovers weren’t all on the quarterback; there was one specific throw to Jerry Jeudy that led to a turnover. It came on a beautiful pass from Sanders, but unfortunately, it bounced off Jeudy’s chest into the arms of the defensive back. That turnover, along with the others, really hindered the Browns’ ability to keep this game close.\n\nCleveland continued to look unprepared and dealt with another game of penalties that greatly hurt drives. Early in the game, the Browns had three penalties before they even ran their fourth play on offense. Consecutive penalties like that decimate drives and hurt the teams’ ability to build momentum and consistency.\n\nCleveland’s offensive line has been missing a number of players throughout the course of the season due to injury and that has continued to hurt the team’s ability to protect the quarterback and give them time to throw the ball. Sanders was sacked five times today, so the lack of protection is not setting him up for success in this offense.\n\nLet me know what you think in the comments – What were the biggest issues for the Browns in their loss to the Bears?",

    "fullText": "For Carson Palmer, the former NFL quarterback and head football coach of the No. 8 Santa Margarita Catholic Eagles, their season officially ended this past Saturday when they defeated No. 17 De La Salle, 47-13, for California’s Open Division state championship.\n\nIn an interview after the win over De La Salle, Palmer stated that he thought his team was playing its best football of the season and wishes his alma mater had one more game left, maybe against a team out of the state of Georgia or another nationally ranked team.\n\n“It’s been an unreal year, from start to finish,” Palmer said to the Los Angeles Times’ Eric Sondheimer. “With the senior class, it has been spectacular. Could not be more proud of these guys, Could not be prouder [of] our coaching staff and support system. This is [an] unbelievable run. We are playing good football. I wish we had a couple more [games] left. Maybe [a] team in Georgia. Maybe somebody else out there.”\n\nThe season might be over for Santa Margarita Catholic, but when Palmer points to his club is playing its best football of the season, he’s got a valid point.\n\nThe Eagles’ recent run of victories includes impressive wins over nationally ranked teams like De La Salle, Corona Centennial, Orange Lutheran, Mater Dei and Sierra Canyon. Palmer mentioning his wishes of his team possibly playing a team out of Georgia or somewhere else possibly points to seeing themselves crowned as a national champion of high school football.\n\nOne would have to wonder what a matchup between Santa Margarita Catholic and a team like Carrollton (Ga.), Buford (Ga.) or St. Frances Academy (Md.), which won the Overtime Nationals championship last week, would’ve been like. All we’re left with is to imagine what that could’ve turned into.\n\nFor California high school football fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard. This comprehensive resource provides real-time updates and final scores from across the Golden State, ensuring you never miss a moment of the Friday night frenzy.

    "description": "The Ravens knew they had an advantage over the Bengals almost immediately in Week 15.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Bengals are going through some things. Days after quarterback Joe Burrow made some worrisome comments about whether he still enjoys playing football, the team was shut out by the division-rival Baltimore Ravens.\n\nBurrow, in particular, did not play well in the loss, putting up his worst statistical game of the season. To make matters even worse, the loss eliminated Burrow and the Bengals from the playoffs, a brutal outcome for a team that came into the year with Super Bowl aspirations.\n\nThe Ravens must have sensed some frustration and disarray from Cincinnati during the contest, because Ravens defensive lineman Dre'Mont Jones felt comfortable enough to lob some trash talk at the team following the win.\n\nAfter the victory, Jones said it was \"too cold for\" the Bengals, per the Ravens' official site.\n\n\"It was too cold for them,\" he said. \"We didn't really discuss the fact they had zero points. I think we just wanted to attack.\"\n\nWhile that might sound harmless to some, it's quite the insult when talking about a team that plays its games in the Midwest during the winter. The Bengals are plenty familiar with cold weather games late in the season. The team even played in one in Week 14, when Burrow and Josh Allen battled it out in a snowstorm.\n\nBurrow put up strong numbers in that contest, though two late interceptions eventually sunk the Bengals.\n\nHe wasn't nearly as effective in Week 15. Against the Ravens, Burrow went 25-of-39, with 225 passing yards and two interceptions. His second interception, in particular, was not typical for Burrow, who sped up with a pass rusher in his face to throw an uncharacteristic pass straight to a defender.\n\nAfter the contest, Burrow took the blame for the loss, saying, \"There’s not a team in the NFL that would have won the game today if I was the quarterback.\"\n\nThe loss dropped Cincinnati to 4-10 on the season. The team currently holds the No. 9 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Ravens, meanwhile, have plenty of reason to celebrate the win. After starting the year 1-5, Baltimore has improved to 7-7 and are back in the hunt for a playoff spot. Given the team's recent run, the Ravens have plenty of reasons to feel good about their position, especially after shutting out a quarterback who has played extremely well against them in the past.",

The Los Angeles Rams star had himself another great performance against the Detroit Lions on Sunday, rushing for 78 yards on 15 carries and scoring two touchdowns.\n\nThat put him over the 1,000-yard mark on the season, giving him 1,030 yards with three games remaining. It’s his third straight 1,000-yard season, making him only the fourth Rams running back ever to have such a streak.\n\nThe others are Eric Dickerson, Marshall Faulk and Steven Jackson. Dickerson and Faulk, of course, are Pro Football Hall of Famers, while Jackson is the franchise’s all-time leader in rushing yards.\n\nKyren Williams joins HOF Eric Dickerson (4-season streak, 1983-86), HOF Marshall Faulk (3-season streak, 1999-2001) & Steven Jackson (8-season streak, 2005-12) as the only Rams with 1,000 yards rushing in 3+ consecutive seasons.\n\n— J.B.

LaDainian Tomlinson is the all-time leader with eight seasons of 1,000 yards and 10 scores on the ground, with Derrick Henry, Adrian Peterson and Emmitt Smith owning seven such seasons.\n\nWilliams needs 270 yards in the final three games to set a new career-high for rushing yards in a season, which currently stands at 1,299 in 2024.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Rams Wire: Kyren Williams becomes 4th Rams RB ever to accomplish this feat",

    "fullText": "Football superstar Lionel Messi has wrapped up his three-day India tour in pollution-choked Delhi, after a chaotic opening in Kolkata.\n\nOn Monday, thousands of fans gathered in a Delhi stadium to get a glimpse of the Argentina and Inter Miami forward.\n\nAs Messi, accompanied by Inter Miami team-mates Luis Suárez and Rodrigo De Paul, strolled on the pitch - kicking balls into the stands, passing with a group of children and signing autographs - the crowd chanted his name.\n\nHis flight from Mumbai had been delayed due to fog, local media reported, and his itinerary had to be trimmed. On Saturday angry fans vandalised a Kolkata stadium because they didn't get to see him during his appearance there.\n\nMessi had a packed schedule in India, attending a string of promotional events in Kolkata, Hyderabad and Mumbai since arriving in the early hours of Saturday.\n\nBefore heading to Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium later that day, he virtually unveiled a 70ft (21m) statue of himself, assembled over 27 days by a 45-strong crew in the eastern city.\n\nThe tour, however, got off to a disastrous start after angry fans ripped up seats and threw items towards the pitch at the stadium.\n\nFootball is hugely popular in West Bengal state - of which Kolkata is the capital - and thousands of adoring supporters had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to attend the event.\n\nHowever, most of them didn't even get to see him as he was surrounded by officials and celebrities on his brief walk around the stadium and then quickly whisked away as the situation turned hostile.\n\nKolkata's The Telegraph newspaper said in an editorial that \"poor management of a hyped-up event, lack of co-ordination\" and security lapses turned the stadium into a \"battlefield\", as fans - denied even a glimpse of Messi - \"vented their anger by indulging in violence\".\n\nThe ruckus, which made international headlines, cast a shadow over Messi's first visit to India since 2011 for what has been called a 'GOAT [greatest of all time] tour'.\n\nThe event organiser in Kolkata has been arrested, police said, and a city court has remanded Satadru Dutta to 14 days in police custody.\n\nMessi's visits to Hyderabad and Mumbai passed off smoothly, with fans sharing their delight at seeing the global icon online and in media interviews.\n\nMessi also met several politicians and celebrities - Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan in Kolkata (at his hotel before the stadium fiasco), opposition leader Rahul Gandhi in Hyderabad, and cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar in Mumbai.\n\nIn between these interactions, Messi could be seen waving to large fan gatherings in stadiums and dribbling the ball with groups of children.\n\nThere were reports earlier that Messi would meet Narendra Modi in Delhi, but the Indian prime minister left the country on Monday morning on a scheduled visit to Jordan, Ethiopia and Oman.\n\nMessi's popularity stems not just from his long international career and wide TV coverage of European football - he's record scorer for Barcelona, the team he used to play for - but also the emotional connection that millions of Indians have with what is often called the beautiful game.\n\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have a ton of their future up in the air after Patrick Mahomes tore his ACL on Sunday.\n\nOne narrative that will get louder in the final few weeks of the season, with the Chiefs already eliminated from the playoffs, is that of Travis Kelce's potential retirement.\n\nIt's been speculated throughout the season that this could be the last year of the great tight end's NFL career.\n\nNow, though, things are quite different than Kelce likely imagined. There's no way he envisioned missing the playoffs this season. And he certainly wouldn't have pictured his quarterback going down like this.\n\nMORE: ACL recovery timeline impacts when Patrick Mahomes, Micah Parsons will return\n\nDoes any of that change the calculus in Kelce's head? That's only for him and future wife Taylor Swift to know.\n\nBut there's a very real chance we get a view of what Kelce is thinking in the final three weeks of the regular season.\n\nIt's not even in what he says or doesn't say. It's in what the Chiefs do.\n\nIf they play Kelce in three meaningless games to close out the season, that feels like they're letting him get a few more moments in before signing off, without concern about the future.\n\nIf the Chiefs decide to sit Kelce down the stretch, that points toward a player who is trying to preserve his health to make another go at it next season.\n\nMORE: Bills may not win the AFC East — but they sent a clear warning to the rest of the NFL\n\nOf course, Kelce himself could come out and make a proclamation one way or the other. He could also decide one thing now and change his mind in the offseason (during which he'll get married on June 13).\n\nBut keep an eye on what the Chiefs do with Kelce these last few weeks. It could be very telling.\n\nJaxson Dart has a 50% head injury problem\n\nTrevor Lawrence had a game never before done by an NFL quarterback\n\nMack Hollins really doesn't like wearing shoes\n\nMicah Parsons' injury doesn't look good\n\nPatrick Mahomes' injury has fans asking Tom Brady ACL question\n\nCommanders' All-Pro puts down fans' draft order concerns",

    "fullText": "Perhaps no one is more hyped about the No. 3 Wisconsin Badgers upsetting No. 1 Texas during the 2025 NCAA volleyball tournament than star Carter Booth.\n\nOn Sunday, the Badgers unleashed an elite game plan to get a dominant 3-1 win in the Elite Eight over the Longhorns. The victory was the 13th straight win for Wisconsin, which now has a date in the Final Four in Kansas City later this week. After the match, Booth was still amped up during an ESPN interview when she dropped a pretty big F-bomb.\n\n\"I refuse to [ expletive] lose,\" she said matter-of-factly.\n\nMORE WOMEN'S SPORTS: Caitlin Clark thankfully looks like herself again at Team USA practice\n\nBooth, realizing her error, immediately apologized and kept going. \"But I refuse. I refuse! And this team refuses,\" she explained. The best part actually isn't the middle blocker's unplanned F-bomb. It's outside hitter Mimi Colyer standing next to Booth. Colyer seemingly appeared stunned at the slip for a millisecond, but jumped in to support her teammate. \"Yeah! Yeah!\" she hysterically said while nodding in agreement.\n\nHere's the video of Booth's ESPN interview.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: Wisconsin's Carter Booth has F-bomb after volleyball upset vs. Texas",

    "fullText": "Kyle Joseph hopes his new relaxed approach in front of goal will give Hull City boss Sergej Jakirovic a headache going forward.\n\nThe 24-year-old former Blackpool man doubled his goal tally for the season in the space of four days with the opener in the 2-0 midweek win over Wrexham before two early goals in Saturday's 3-1 victory at Millwall - the team his dad supports.\n\nAfter ending a seven-match scoreless streak against Wrexham, Joseph told BBC Radio Humberside: \"The last couple of games I've probably stopped worrying.\n\n\"I can't control what people's opinions of me are, all I can control is what I can do on the pitch.\n\n\"Being in the moment and staying in the zone has really helped me, I want to continue with that, taking it a game at a time.\"\n\nThe six points have taken the Tigers back into the Championship play-off positions and Joseph said: \"It's a special win as [Millwall] have been flying.\n\n\"You can see the togetherness of the squad. It's a special group. Everyone is buying into it, pulling in the same direction, from top to bottom.\n\n\"It's so important to have than unity and togetherness. There's a really good feeling in the camp.\"\n\nJoseph said a conversation with team-mate Oli McBurnie the day before the Millwall game had helped him.\n\n\"To have a player like Oli to learn off, there's so much I can squeeze out of him,\" he said.\n\n\"He's played La Liga, Championship and Premier League, he's been down there in the lower leagues too. He gives me ideas and solutions, I find that invaluable and it helps my game so much. He's an unbelievable player and human being.\"\n\nWith McBurnie scoring in his two appearances off the bench after injury, Jakirovic has a dilemma up front, and Joseph added: \"All I can do is try to be in the manager's mind.\n\n\"I'll never kick my toys out of the pram for not being in the team, I want to play but if I don't, I don't sulk, I am a good teammate on the bench.\n\n\"I want to give the manager a headache and show I am ready to play.\"",

The Swiss government’s proposal currently says it can only use equity capital, which can absorb losses more readily.",

    "description": "A little Saturday morning project",
    "fullText": "I went to update my site's bio this past weekend and wrote a custom static site generator instead.\n\nIt's an itch I've wanted to scratch. Ditch Next.js. Convert my blog posts to MDX (JSX in markdown). Autogenerate posts and an RSS feed. Write the layout in React, styles in CSS modules. Output only HTML+CSS, with islands of client-side React progressively hydrated as needed.\n\nI like JSX and the composability of React components. IMO this is why React \"won\"; it made writing frontend systems easy.\n\nOn a Saturday morning in between playing with my kids, I dove in with Opus 4.5. After a few hours of tinkering, I got exactly what I wanted.\n\nHere's a template you can fork and play with: https://github.com/pcmaffey/bun-ssg. It includes the \"less than 25kb of HTML+CSS\" build output.\n\nThe last time I posted was un-ironically, the last time I rebuilt my blog engine. I had gone deep on a hypothesis that the scrollable UX of the web contributes mightily to the demise of reading comprehension; I thought \"paging\" presented a better, more intentional UX for reading online. It turned out poorly. I over-engineered an engine on top of Next.js. No one liked it. So I tore it out, pushed a quick update and haven't checked back since.\n\nThe implementation was fine. It ended up similar to a presentation framework (like reveal.js) powered by a blog engine. My idea was to then create a reader app you could point at any article and convert into pages / slides.\n\nTwo years later I can't even get it to run. Updating the dependencies looks like hell. Sigh. I know it's time to start over. I've just been avoiding it.\n\nI'd been waiting for Bun \"Bake\" for months. But it keeps getting delayed, and the likelihood it will support MDX out of the box is low. I'd also almost certainly have to implement React islands myself, given React's inane push for React Server Components. But I figured, they'd have enough primitives in place to support React SSG as a first-class citizen, as opposed to Next.js post app-router.\n\nOr whatever they're calling it now. I'm not sure what their plans are now that they no longer need to compete with Vercel...\n\nDan Abramov argues that RSC is React's take on island architecture, which makes sense to some degree. My counter-argument to him: it's not the solution the ecosystem was asking for, and the incentives developing it in collaboration with Vercel are suspect.\n\nNot to pile on, but the recent security flaws expose how short-sighted it is to embrace the deep-composability of RSC architecture. Unless it solves a very specific problem for you, the complexity tradeoff is rarely worth it.\n\nStaring at the errors in my CLI, I realized I did not want to use another framework. It's why I had already discarded the idea of switching to Astro. Twiddling around someone else's abstractions and incentives, frustrations fitting together the final 20% of a project... I've been down that road too many times before. It's never fun. The tradeoffs you don't know you're making are the biggest risk.\n\nWhen you build it yourself, the initial 80% takes longer. But you can custom fit the final implementation to your needs. Now with AI, if you know what you want, the risk calculus shifts strongly in favor of DIY. A strange inversion: \"n ot invented here\" syndrome gets a boost from LLMs trained on everyone's data.\n\nYou can read how it works in the README. This site pcmaffey.com loads < 50kb of HTML and CSS, not including the inlined SVG's. There are no islands on the site, so no React. Only a small JS script for the But still, I built support for progressive hydration because I intend to use it for my main side project.\n\nGlobbing a pages directory and hydrating each with a { posts } prop on build was straightforward enough. Likewise with MDX and frontmatter support. Getting the DX right for detecting and rendering islands within MDX took some tinkering. The components <Counter /> get replaced with placeholders (<div data-island=\"counter\" /> ) and a script to hydrate them client side. That required a component registry with a bit of scaffolding to get right.\n\nBun supports loading CSS modules, but to get the prefixed classnames to match up, I needed to maintain a map of components to classnames inside a .cache directory.\n\nAlso, I use a lot of SVG's; so I added SVGR to inline these, so that fill=\"currentColor\" works and they're targetable via CSS. Unfortunately, importing these into components as logo.svg conflicted with bun-types native svg file support. To workaround this, I had to auto-generate logo.svg.tsx files and redirect the imports behind the scenes.\n\nI went to the extra lengths to get CSS Modules to work, mostly because I could, and they are easily my favorite composition method for design systems. In the template, they're entirely optional, and I imagine it would be straightforward enough to add whatever flavor of styling you prefer.\n\nThe last subsystem I had to hack together was hot reloading, since my component registry setup doesn't jive with import.meta.hot HMR. Instead, I created a dev-runner.ts that watches the entire src directory and uses server-sent events, which were new to me. Client pages get hydrated in dev with a liveReloadScript that listens for events and reloads the page. Basic, but sufficient for my blog.\n\nFor the sake of long-term stability, I'd be curious to replace Bun with Vite. I like Bun; and so long as I don't lean too heavily on their abstractions, I'm not too worried about that dependency. But if I hit some error the next time I go to update my site, no doubt I'll make the switch.\n\nI've come to accept some things about myself. Yes, my side projects have side projects. This is perhaps my favorite development with AI. I can now explore these rabbit holes without spending weeks or sometimes months sifting through implementation details. I get to scratch an itch I wouldn't normally consider a worthwhile energy tradeoff and build a thing that works exactly how I want it to.",

    "fullText": "Investors are fixated on artificial intelligence and the mega-cap tech giants driving much of the stock market's gains. But Goldman Sachs says the bigger opportunities next year may come from somewhere else.\n\n\"At the sector level, we expect the 2026 acceleration in economic growth will boost EPS growth most in cyclical sectors including Industrials, Materials, and Consumer Discretionary,\" Goldman's analysts wrote in a Thursday report. The analysts noted that the firm's broader forecast also incorporates easing tariff pressures.\n\nIn line with that view, the analysts said that they expect earnings per share of real estate companies to rise from 5% this year to 15% next year, while those in consumer discretionary are expected to increase from 3% to 7%.\n\nIndustrial companies are also set for a major rebound, with EPS growth forecast to accelerate from 4% to 15%.\n\nSigns of this shift are already showing up in market action.\n\nIn a separate Friday report, Goldman noted that cyclical stocks have surged, beating defensive names for 14 trading days through Thursday — the longest streak in more than 15 years.\n\nEven so, Goldman analysts say the recent outperformance still isn't enough to reflect the firm's more optimistic growth outlook. Market positioning within equities suggests investors expect growth closer to 2% — well below Goldman's 2.5% forecast.\n\n\"Despite the cyclical rebound and widespread economic optimism in our client conversations, the market does not appear to be fully pricing the likely economic acceleration in 2026,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThat acceleration is central to Goldman's view. The bank's analysts wrote that they expect overall US growth to pick up next year, which would help drive a 12% rise in S&P 500 earnings per share.\n\nGoldman's latest reports arrive as investors continue to debate whether the stock market is drifting into a speculative bubble fueled by AI enthusiasm.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up 16% this year, with the \"Magnificent Seven\" megacap tech stocks now accounting for roughly one-third of the index's weight.\n\nShares of AI chip maker Nvidia — the world's most valuable publicly traded company — have climbed 30% this year alone.\n\nLast month, Goldman's analysts wrote that the market may have already priced in most of the potential gains from AI.",

    "description": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jane Way, 84, who works 30 hours a week as a US-based accountant for a South African orphanage.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jane Way, 84, who lives in a suburb of Phoenix. Way works 30 hours a week as a US-based accountant for a South African orphanage. She works partly out of financial necessity but said she would work regardless, despite some health issues. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI started working at 7 in my parents' restaurant. I have a degree in accounting. I was the first woman from Cal Poly to be invited to help recruit students for CPA firms. I was then offered a position at a Big 8 firm, where I worked for two years and became certified.\n\nI was a CPA for 46 years in various roles, including franchising and retail, across different kinds of companies. I was a prominent figure in accounting and finance departments.\n\nMy husband was also a CPA. He started an import business after a massive heart attack in 1972. I've been widowed since 1987 and never remarried.\n\nAt the time, I was the CFO of an international franchisor of rental equipment and party goods. My husband and I also owned and managed an import company specializing in gourmet and decorative accessories.\n\nAfter his death, I was not prepared to handle all the responsibilities of a high-ranking CFO accounting position. I began working as a contract employee for various companies and with a rental company for several years.\n\nI've primarily worked in the private sector. My emphasis for the last 12 years has been with nonprofits, and I'm currently working with an Arizona nonprofit that has an orphanage in South Africa.\n\nI'm very active in my church and serve on the missions committee. Someone brought this charity to the church as an opportunity for us to get involved.\n\n9 a.m. my time is the end of the day in South Africa. My workday for Open Arms Home for Children begins at 11 p.m. and ends at 8 a.m.\n\nI do some work during the day that I can complete without direct supervision. I don't work a full day most days, but it averages about 30 hours a week. I do financial statements, analyses, and reports during the regular day. I take a couple of long naps every 24-hour cycle.\n\nI'm a person who thrives on work. I need to be doing something to make things better for people. Otherwise, I don't feel like I'm productive at all.\n\nMy mantra for many years has been to share my best. For me, work is its own reward, and it keeps me thinking fresh thoughts. I need the money and am open to additional opportunities, but I would work anyway.\n\nI've retired at least twice, and it just doesn't suit me. I was shortly retired in 1990 after running my accounting practice, and my \"long retirement\" was from 2004 until 2011. In my 60s, I thought I was through with work.\n\nI put two grandchildren through college and spent my retirement early, so I don't have huge resources. This is what I chose to do.\n\nWhen the family gathered to celebrate my 80th birthday, I shared that I have a 20-year plan. I'm almost five years into that plan, and some things are better, while others are worse, but I intend to be here to celebrate reaching 100 and hope to still be working.\n\nOur lives shape us, just as we shape our lives. My priorities are my faith and family, followed by work, and then writing. I'm very close to my family. I have one son and three grandchildren. I decided that I needed to be an influence in their lives.\n\nSome are serious, but I don't think about that, any more than necessary, as there are other things that need to be done. You don't reach 84 without facing some health challenges.\n\nI've been in a wheelchair for five years, so my ability to be mobile and do things outside my home is pretty limited. My entire career and family are ways for me to stay connected to the world.\n\nI work from home, and everything I need is conveniently located nearby. My son and one of my grandsons live with me. My son had a stroke in 2016 and is disabled. My grandson's marriage fell apart, and we decided it was a matter of economy for the three of us to live together.\n\nIt has gone very well. Everybody takes care of their own stuff, and I do most of the cooking. We share expenses.\n\nSince I share my home with my son and grandson, I have ready tech support. Along the way, I've had to take breaks due to health issues, the most recent being COVID-19 in 2023. I was in the hospital for almost two weeks and then in rehab for six weeks.\n\nI hope to stay with this organization for the next decade and contribute to its success. I know they're pleased with the work I do, and it will be up to me to decide when I no longer want to work.\n\nFind a field you enjoy, and it won't be work. It's important to volunteer and give back to your community.\n\nIf I had regrets, one might be that I didn't cultivate relationships. I met friends at church. My close friends here in Phoenix started out as clients in Yuma in 1987. I have many newer friends my age, and we get together and do things, but it isn't the same as having people who know your history.\n\nThe most important thing is to be true to yourself and do what you want to do and what makes you happy. People need to be able to make their own life choices and suffer the consequences if they don't turn out as they hoped.\n\nPart of what makes us adults is going through the hard times and understanding that that's a part of living. Nothing is just handed to us.",

    "description": "Trump is expanding short-term credential programs through the Workforce Pell grant, while the debate over the value of a college degree continues.",
    "fullText": "The four-year college degree no longer has the same pull it once did — and the Trump administration agrees.\n\nThe Department of Education concluded its negotiations on the Workforce Pell program on December 12, a new initiative included in President Donald Trump's \"big beautiful\" spending legislation.\n\nThe program would extend Pell grants to low-income borrowers in short-term certification programs, with the intention of providing more funding for alternative paths to a four-year college degree or trade school.\n\nNicholas Kent, the department's undersecretary, acknowledged during remarks at the beginning of negotiations that a standard four-year college degree is losing its value.\n\n\"Americans are questioning whether the value of higher education is worth the cost. Polling also shows that students do not believe they are graduating with the specific skills that they need,\" Kent said. He added that skepticism about college degrees has led to students \"showing more interest in pathways that get them into the labor force more quickly and without unnecessary debt.\"\n\nCollege still remains the primary path in the US for postsecondary education, and recent data from the New York Federal Reserve showed that it continues to lead to higher earnings. In addition, proponents argue the value of college extends beyond earnings to social opportunities and exposure to new ideas.\n\nHowever, high student debt loads and a growing number of jobs eliminating degree requirements have sparked a growing interest in short-term credential programs and the trades, which the Trump administration is attempting to boost.\n\nChris Madaio, a senior advisor at the nonprofit The Institute for College Access and Success, told Business Insider that with more Pell grant support extended to short-term programs, it's likely that more schools will offer them and more students will enroll.\n\n\"I think it's all ensuring that students take what's right for them,\" Madaio said. \"These programs should pay off for students, and they should give a good value and use students' limited lifetime Pell grant eligibility for something that's going to work for them and potentially allow them to get a job later down the road.\"\n\nThe Department of Education's Workforce Pell proposal will have a period of public comment before it is set to be implemented in July 2026.\n\nIf the rule is implemented as proposed, eligibility guidelines would vary by state. According to the department, each state will determine what qualifies as a high-skill, high-wage, or in-demand job based on what aligns with the industry needs in that state. For example, a state where agriculture dominates the economy might choose to prioritize short-term programs in that field.\n\nMadaio said that this state variance is by design: \"It's really important that states are taking a close look at what they're approving to ensure that there are jobs in that state and that these are valuable workforce training programs for jobs that are needed in that state.\"\n\nAccountability is key here, Madaio said, and states should ensure that schools are delivering on the value of the programs they offer. Otherwise, students could be left paying off loans they cannot afford — and that's something that the gainful employment rule, which the department is set to negotiate in January, will address.\n\n\"These are really positive developments that show that there's a broad agreement across the political spectrum that we owe it to students to make sure that the programs that they're investing in are going to provide a quality education and that they're going to get something out of it,\" Carolyn Fast, director of higher education policy at the left-leaning think-tank The Century Foundation, told Business Insider.\n\nSome high schools across the country are working to shift the emphasis away from a four-year college as the only option. Business Insider previously visited a public high school in rural Wyoming, for example, that works to equip students for college, career, or the workforce, giving students the freedom to choose the path that best suits their interests.\n\nOverall, the higher education financing landscape is undergoing significant changes. In addition to the negotiations on Workforce Pell and gainful employment, the Department of Education recently concluded negotiations on a repayment overhaul that condenses the number of existing repayment plans, replacing them with less generous options that could lead to higher payments and shorter timelines to debt relief for student-loan borrowers.\n\nAs the slew of higher education changes takes effect, Madaio said that students should expect to see more advertising for short-term programs that are funded by grants. He recommended that students closely examine the actual costs of a program and its outcomes to avoid predatory behavior by schools.\n\n\"A critical piece is for students to do their homework when deciding on a certificate credential program, and then consider what kind of jobs they can get for that, and are those things that they need the training for?\" Madaio said.",

    "title": "The year coding changed forever",
    "description": "Optimism, laziness, and magical thinking: The year vibe coding took over tech.",
    "fullText": "Sriraam Raja, the founding engineer at the software company Decode, has been using generative AI to write code for two years. He says he can get projects done about twice as fast when he uses a chatbot to code with intention. Then one day, he fired off directions, and as he sat there while the bot's wheels turned, he realized he could have actively written what he was aimlessly waiting for the bot to do. \"I was giving away a bit of my agency, and so I made a decision to be very conscious,\" he tells me.\n\nRaja has become \"very specific about when I delegate, and also how much I delegate,\" he says. Waiting for the AI to spit out code can disrupt the flow of his work, and trusting too much work to it has led him to sometimes get bogged down in a lengthy review process. He's also anxious about the long-term effects AI can have on how we all think and problem solve. \"There's a side effect where everyone's confidence has increased, but so has their laziness, and their willingness to learn things from first principles has dropped,\" he says. \"I've definitely seen a drop in curiosity that I haven't seen before, and so that worries me.\"\n\nThe Collins dictionary made vibe coding its 2025 word of the year. Coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy in February, the term refers to using language and generative AI to speed up the coding process. Soon after, companies were adding it as a desired skill in job listings.\n\nVibe coding was the catalyst for the sort of vibe work era we've entered. It's a shift in how people think about their roles and relationships to work amid an AI boom, and software engineering, long considered a stable and lucrative career path, has perhaps been the career most scrutinized and pushed down a path toward automation. Product managers have suggested that AI will supercharge them, allowing them to take on some technical coding tasks and work without engineers.\n\nExecs have been all-in: Mark Zuckerberg said he expected AI to write half of Meta's code within a year; this spring, AI was already doing about a third of code at Google and on some Microsoft projects. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei predicted in March that 90% of code would be generated by AI in three to six months. The bullish estimate hasn't materialized for most, but Amodei said in October the company's AI tool Claude was writing most of the code at Anthropic. Cognition, which built an AI-powered software engineer it named Devin, is now valued at $10 billion. Some without computer science backgrounds or any training in coding are vibe coding their own projects.\n\nVibe coding isn't yet the miracle that AI evangelists have professed. AI-generated code can have sneaky errors that pose security risks. As it takes on the work of junior developers, companies eager for gain could displace humans. Time banked with shortcuts now could disrupt training ground for learning basic coding skills, creating a tech worker career ladder collapse could ricochet through the industry. There is potential for developers to save time, to use AI to learn new languages and skills (something Raja tells me he's done), and to pare down their technical debt, or code that needs maintenance. But the impact of AI on the industry is more complicated than it is a silver bullet to efficiency.\n\nLast year, \"we were dealing with a lot of optimism and a lot of magical thinking\" around the capabilities of AI, says Tariq Shaukat, CEO of Sonar, a company that provides developers with tools to verify code. \"The vibe engineering tools are producing a lot of quantity. It's getting more functionally correct, but it's actually becoming more difficult to determine the quality and get the level of trust that you need to integrate that into your code base.\" The ranks of AI holdouts among developers are shrinking. A 2025 survey of professional developers from Stack Overflow found that only 19.3% don't use AI, and a commensurate 19.7% have an unfavorable opinion of AI. Yet less than 3% of respondents said they highly trust AI for accuracy.\n\nAnyone who has asked a chatbot a question knows that even a short inquiry often results in a verbose response. The same is true of code — when AI generates it, it's typically longer, making the possibility of errors hiding in the code more likely. Amy Carrillo Cotten, senior director of customer transformation at software development company Uplevel, told me in September: \"For a lot of engineers, the only thing that looks different is where they spend their time, not exactly how much time it took.\" Uplevel studied 800 software developers last year and compared the productivity levels of those who used GitHub's Copilot to those who did not. The developers who used Copilot weren't more efficient or less burnt out, and their code had bugs in it 41% more frequently. (GitHub's own research found that those who used Copilot wrote about 18 lines of clean code, compared to 16 lines for those who didn't.) For many, that shift from writing to reviewing code is \"not the job they signed up for,\" Shaukat says, which brings a big adjustment for many developers.\n\n\"The job looks completely different,\" says Frank Fusco, CEO of a software company called Silicon Society. His company works with clients on their software, but now they often get amateur, vibe coded versions of those ideas as the starting point. \"What I would normally do in code that would take me days, I now do in words and it takes me hours.\" But Fusco tells me he worries about a decline in critical thinking and basic coding skills. We're \"hardwired,\" he says, to find \"the shortest path to the solution.\" But that approach isn't the best for sharpening coding skills. \"It really is a muscle that you have to work all the time.\"\n\nIt's tricky to say AI is already killing developer jobs. Years of layoffs and \"right-sizing\" in the tech industry, paired with the economic precarity that has also defined 2025, could be shifting industry roles alongside AI. As of November, there were about 92,500 active job postings seeking software engineers, down from nearly 102,000 last November and 159,000 at the start of 2023, according to data from CompTIA, a nonprofit trade association for the US IT industry. The number of active tech job posts overall has fallen, from 621,000 in early 2023 to 433,500 last month. But the proportion of open jobs looking for AI skills has jumped by 53% this year.\n\nAfter two decades of being told to pursue computer science as a stable career and a proliferation of coding bootcamps, working as a developer may not be as cushy. College seniors studying computer science are more likely than any other discipline to say they're \"very pessimistic\" about their careers, according to a 2025 survey from early career website Handshake. They're the group most likely to say the advances of generative AI have made them regret their major choice. But young people are divided — 43% of computer science majors said they think AI will have a positive effect on their careers.\n\nAutomation is in some ways marking \"a correction\" on the developer labor market, says April Schuppel, developer relations manager at software company Apryse. Before AI, \"we needed as many people who were really pushing out the code to take the ideas of the visionaries and bring them to life.\" Now, \"the people who have always been able to make the most impact, they're still the ones that are the safest.\" Developers who looked at their jobs as clearing tickets might be more replaceable than those who were creative and cared about the project from start to finish. We're far from realizing the end game of vibe coding, but for creative, forward-thinking developers, there's optimism for now. \"The more well-rounded people are the ones that are going to have success,\" Schuppel says.\n\nAI could bring more opportunity for software testers, and also help companies pare down their technical debt. The developer job market might look messy right now, but there's still a heavy focus on the human aspect of the career than in the picture painted by some Big Tech execs. \"If there are opportunities for more fine-tuned models, more specialized models that only do certain types of code updates, and there is a way to use that more to augment human developers as opposed to replace, that seems like that's where this is going,\" says Tim Herbert, chief research officer at CompTIA.\n\nCodebases are valuable, and the security risks posed by goofs in AI code are serious threats. Traffic to vibe coding sites slumped in September after a summer of hype. Even Karpathy said his latest project is \"basically entirely hand-written (with tab autocomplete)\" in a post on X. \"I tried to use claude/codex agents a few times but they just didn't work well enough at all and net unhelpful.\" If 2025 was the year tech companies went all in on AI, 2026 might be the year when some of the craze around vibe coding subsides and reality sets in.\n\nAmanda Hoover is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

    "title": "Inside Meta's 'year of intensity' as its AI overhaul, culture wars, and crackdowns collide",
    "description": "Meta's AI overhaul, culture shifts, layoffs, and performance crackdowns have sparked internal clashes, employee exits, and morale concerns in 2025.",
    "fullText": "When CEO Mark Zuckerberg warned Meta employees in January to \"buckle up\" for an \"intense\" year, he meant it.\n\nDetermined to dominate the next era of AI, Meta has spent the past year in blitz mode. Zuckerberg has overhauled divisions, reallocated resources to new products, and poured billions into the AI arms race with OpenAI, Google, and others. Zuckerberg's push came with a marked shift in leadership tone as well, including his public celebration of what he described as more \"masculine energy.\"\n\nAlong the way, the company has trimmed its metaverse ambitions, raised performance expectations, and cut thousands of jobs, all while chasing Zuckerberg's grand vision of \"personal superintelligence.\"\n\nIn some ways, the moves have boosted efficiency and led to faster innovation. In others, some divisions have been roiled by internal tensions, including clashes resulting from AI reorganizations and Zuckerberg flaming the AI talent wars, according to current and former employees. Some also said Meta's layoffs earlier this year were unnecessarily demoralizing when Zuckerberg branded the affected employees as \"low performers.\"\n\nThe company's transformation comes at a time when Big Tech is rewriting its playbook, cutting costs, toughening its tone with employees, and making massive bets that AI will determine who leads in the next decade.\n\nMeta is wagering that moving harder and faster will help give the company an edge over its rivals. After months of a cultural reset in early 2025, employee sentiment improved in recent months, a Meta spokesperson said, citing a recent internal employee sentiment questionnaire.\n\nInvestors are worried about the company's strategy, particularly its plan to sink tens of billions of dollars into AI infrastructure and talent. The question is whether Meta is overdoing it. Shares have risen 7.5% this year, less than half that of the S&P 500, and have underperformed most of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies.\n\n\"The company must articulate its vision, show how its pieces fit together, and, most importantly, demonstrate steady growth,\" said Mike Proulx, research director at Forrester, who covers Meta.\n\nThis account of Meta's \"year of intensity\" is based on interviews conducted by Business Insider with more than a dozen current and former employees, analysts, and academic researchers.\n\nOver the summer, Zuckerberg sought to change the perception that Meta was trailing behind its AI rivals. In June, the company made a $14 billion investment in AI training company Scale AI and hired its 28-year-old founder, Alexandr Wang, as chief AI officer. Two months later, it rebranded its team focused on AI efforts to Meta Superintelligence Labs (MSL).\n\nAs Meta's leadership sought to reorganize teams and recruit top talent from competitors, some ex-employees went public with the view that the company lacked a coherent AI strategy.\n\nJoena Zhang, a former Meta Superintelligence Labs employee, said in a November LinkedIn post that \"nobody really knew what anyone was doing\" during the first half of the year at MSL — then called GenAI. She said there were \"endless\" meetings that didn't result in \"actual decisions.\" And in a July Substack post, former Meta researcher Tijmen Blankevoort wrote that Meta had \"a wavering vision that was tough for team members to enthusiastically rally behind.\"\n\nMeta began offering massive compensation packages to attract top AI talent from rival labs, including OpenAI and Google's AI division, DeepMind.\n\nThis created rifts between the \"old guard\" and newer hires by offering outsiders significantly more compensation than existing employees got. It fueled a quiet competition to prove whose ideas for AI features were more valuable, according to two MSL employees.\n\nThe tensions also revolved around access to computing resources and the prestige of being associated with the elite team at the center of MSL, as one researcher previously told Business Insider.\n\nIn August, Meta undertook its fourth major reorganization in six months to streamline its AI efforts, dividing MSL into four teams: a new TBD Lab (short for \"to be determined\"), a product team overseeing the Meta AI assistant, an infrastructure team, and the company's long-standing Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) lab.\n\nAfter the shake-up, it was unclear who owned which projects, and people were reassigned between teams, according to the two MSL employees, one of whom added that the flow of information between TBD and MSL wasn't always even.\n\nAsked about the internal shake-up, a Meta spokesperson pointed Business Insider to an X post from Andy Stone, a Meta communications executive, describing previous reporting about the company's AI restructuring as \"navelgazing.\"\n\nAt least eight of Meta's AI staffers, including researchers, engineers, and a senior product leader, left the company within two months of MSL's formation. Meta said most had been with the company for years, and that some attrition is normal for an organization of its size.\n\nTwo months after the August shuffle, Meta cut about 600 jobs as part of a wider reorganization of the MSL division. Wang told employees that the cuts were designed to speed up decision-making.\n\nShay Boloor, chief market strategist at Futurum Equities, told Business Insider that the changes have helped Meta move faster in model releases and in integrating its AI across Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\n\"Meta is now one of the only companies training frontier-class models and deploying them to billions of users, which is exactly where I want it to be,\" he said.\n\nMeta also shook up its leadership ranks in Reality Labs, the division responsible for developing its virtual and mixed reality products.\n\nThe company is considering budget cuts for the metaverse unit that sits within Reality Labs, which could result in job cuts, a person familiar with the matter previously told Business Insider. A Meta spokesperson said that it is reallocating some of its investment \"from Metaverse toward AI glasses and wearables\" to match momentum, adding that the company \"wasn't planning any broader changes than that.\"\n\nThe MSL layoffs were part of a broader effort by Meta to tighten operational efficiency this year, as the company reduced layers of management and implemented a stricter performance review process than in previous years.\n\nZuckerberg told employees in January he had \"decided to raise the bar on performance management\" and would move quickly to cut about 5% of \"low performers.\" The company cut about 3,600 jobs in February from its workforce of about 78,450 employees.\n\nMultiple employees said the revised system created a pressure-cooker environment and encouraged more cutthroat competition between staff. Managers and employees described a shift toward short-term projects as teams looked to protect themselves from landing at the bottom of the ranking.\n\nThe requirement to place more staff in lower performance tiers saw some managers strategically leave positions open or hire employees solely to place them in the bottom tier, two managers said.\n\nThe company says employee sentiment improved in the second half of the year. Its latest internal employee sentiment questionnaire, which ran from October 20 to November 3, showed \"optimism\" rose to 80%, \"pride\" at 71% and \"confidence in leadership\" at 68%, according to data Meta shared with Business Insider.\n\nEach of those metrics was up between 10 and 12 percentage points compared to the last survey, which ran April 21 through May 5, the spokesperson said. The latest survey had a 91% participation rate, Meta said.\n\nThe combination of policy shifts, reorganizations, job cuts, and stricter performance expectations triggered a wave of departures in 2025, according to five internal farewell posts reviewed by Business Insider. Some employees said Meta's evolving political posture and internal governance changes no longer aligned with their values.\n\n\"Meta in 2025 is a very different company from what Oculus & Facebook were in 2017,\" one engineer, who left Meta in August after nearly eight years at the company, wrote in an internal farewell message, viewed by Business Insider. These types of notes are known internally as \"badge posts.\"\n\nHe cited a \"matter of principles\" for his departure, adding that the \"sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit alignment with the new US government\" clashed with his personal values.\n\nSimilar themes surfaced in other employee departures this year.\n\n\"The unnecessary pressure, lack of empathy, and occasional lack of fairness,\" one former employee wrote in another farewell post from January, seen by Business Insider. \"Fighting for scope. Narratives. Oh, the narratives - I'm so looking forward to not hearing that word for a while. Smart and kind people bending their values to survive because they've been on the edge of their seats for too long.\"\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the resignations represent a small slice of the company. Meta has 78,450 employees, and head count is up 8% year-over-year.\n\nSome departing employees told Business Insider that they no longer had a meaningful outlet to share feedback with leadership on topics such as DEI and embracing \"masculine energy\" because questions for Q&A sessions were preselected, and that posts critical of leadership decisions were sometimes removed from the platform.\n\n\"We will skip questions that we expect might be unproductive if they leak or things like people-related questions that have already been answered,\" Meta's VP of internal communications, Jonny Oser, informed employees in an internal post earlier this year.\n\nIn a January poll titled \"Measuring workplace fear,\" dozens of Meta employees voted anonymously on how afraid they were that speaking openly about working conditions could lead to disciplinary action. The winning responses were \"extremely afraid\" and \"very afraid,\" according to a screenshot of the poll viewed by Business Insider.\n\nEven as some employees headed for the exits, others say they are optimistic about the new environment.\n\nTwo current employees told Business Insider that Meta can be a rewarding place to work, particularly for individuals accustomed to operating in high-pressure environments.\n\n\"I would say that people who are confident in their skills and are high performers generally thrive,\" one senior engineer said.\n\nAnother Meta veteran said the company used to \"coddle its staff\" — but \"that's changing.\"\n\nAn engineer said there are reasons to stay put. \"The positives are that we are still on the frontier in R&D,\" they said. \"There are a lot of cool AI, wearables, and robotics things going on,\" giving high-performing employees a chance to learn and build \"a lot of good skills.\"\n\n\"Also, we get paid a lot, still, and get free food and snacks,\" they said. \"That helps.\"",

    "title": "How CEO Winnie Park is reshaping Five Below into 'Costco for kids'",
    "description": "Five Below's decision to appoint relatively little-known retail executive Winnie Park as CEO last year is looking like a brilliant move.",
    "fullText": "Christmas, it is often said, is a time for second chances.\n\nSo it would seem for Five Below, which is celebrating a transformational year under the leadership of CEO Winnie Park.\n\nThe stock is up about 85% this year so far — that's well more than the returns of most major retail stocks and AI chip darling Nvidia in the same period.\n\nTo rewind, last year's holiday season wasn't looking like a very joyful one for the tween- and teen-focused retailer.\n\nThe Philadelphia-based company was on its way to posting its fourth-straight quarter with negative or flat comparable sales, and that was coming off several prior years of underwhelming performance.\n\nWhile Five Below was managing to grow overall sales through the addition of new stores, existing stores weren't resonating with shoppers. It was also dealing with industry-wide challenges, including shoplifting and the rise of low-priced e-commerce players like Shein and Temu.\n\nWith Five Below's stock languishing around a third of its 2023 peak, the company tapped Park, then-CEO of Forever 21, to take over as CEO in December 2024 during the holiday rush last year.\n\n\"When she came in, she was sort of an unknown quantity,\" Mizuho retail analyst David Bellinger told Business Insider. \"It was a question of how is she going to fix this business immediately.\"\n\nWhile Park may not have been the most widely known CEO on Wall Street, she did come equipped with decades of industry experience, including as CEO of Forever 21 and Paper Source, as well as executive roles at Duty Free Shoppers and Levi's, and a stint with McKinsey's retail team.\n\n\"Her background allows her to really understand how all of these different aspects of the Five Below business work, because she's drawing on a very rich career,\" Global Data retail analyst Neil Saunders told Business Insider.\n\n\"A lot of people come in sometimes as CEOs, and they don't have a tremendous background in retail, or they may have experience in merchandising, but not in supply chains,\" he added. \"Winnie Park was almost like the complete package.\"\n\nFive Below did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\nPark wasted no time diving in with cofounder and executive chairman Tom Vellios and chief operating officer Ken Bull.\n\nThe first order of business was refocusing the merchandise on what Five Below's core teen and tween customers want.\n\nBellinger said this was a result of Park's major reset with the sourcing teams, guiding them to find hot items and buy with confidence, while steering away from items, like luggage, that were more adult-focused.\n\n\"They loaded the store up with 'Lilo and Stitch' merchandise, SpongeBob, Hello Kitty — so when you do have these good, well-known brands, it sort of lifts the whole store,\" he said.\n\nThe merchandising effort was also paired with a social media push that the company says has helped attract new shoppers.\n\nPark's other major area of focus was simplifying store operations for both employees and customers.\n\nWith a bit of planning and an incremental investment in labor hours, Five Below says it has improved in-stock rates and customer support at its stores, helping to drive higher sales.\n\n\"Winnie Park is the type of leader that has a very clear vision for the business,\" Saunders said. \"She doesn't really overcomplicate things.\"\n\nIn addition to getting Five Below back to some principles it may have lost touch with in recent years, Park is also showing a willingness to let go of at least one thing that may have been holding the company back: its $5 price point.\n\nThe last few years of inflation haven't made it easy for retailers with dollar-denominated branding to stick to their original promises. Dollar Tree had to hike its base price to $1.25, and it's tough to run a 99 Cents Only store at a time when the US government is eliminating the penny. President Donald Trump's trade war this year hasn't been much help for import-heavy businesses, either.\n\nTo manage these cost pressures, the company lumped more merchandise in a catch-all section of the store called Five Beyond, which it had set up years earlier.\n\nBut that distinction brought unnecessary complexity without meaningful benefit, and the company recently ditched the plan in favor of grouping products by category instead of a price threshold.\n\n\"It was a very disjointed merchandising set,\" Bellinger said. \"Anything in that price threshold was in the back there.\"\n\nNow, he said, \"the way they've assorted the store and spread these items out makes a lot more sense.\"\n\nBellinger said the move shows that Park understands a critical lesson that successful retailers have had to reckon with in the last few years: value and price are not the same thing.\n\n\"You could find value in that $30 item. It's all relative,\" he said.\n\nTaken together — exciting products, well-run stores, a focus on great value — Five Below is starting to look in some ways more like a warehouse club than a discount store.\n\n\"Five Below is essentially the Costco for kids,\" Bellinger said. \"Maybe you want to get some core birthday or party items, and then you wind up expanding your basket and buying all these things you didn't know were there. And then it leads you to your next visit, and you just keep coming back.\"\n\nThe success of the past year will raise the expectations for next year's quarterly comparable sales numbers, but Five Below still has several levers it says it can pull to meet the moment.\n\nBellinger said investors are keen to see whether the recent changes at Five Below have led to a structural shift that will drive long-term performance.\n\nThe average Five Below store generates annual sales of around $2.1 million, but Bellinger said Park's initiatives could significantly boost that number: \"Why can't that be a $3 million store now, or even higher?\"",

    "description": "Elanco CEO Jeff Simmons said he tells his kids to find their passion in their careers.",
    "fullText": "When Jeff Simmons isn't steering animal-health giant Elanco, he's focused on a different kind of leadership challenge: raising six kids.\n\n\"We have family meetings every Sunday,\" Simmons told Business Insider.\n\nThose check-ins double as career-coaching lessons. With some of their children already in the workforce, Simmons said he and his wife are consistently coaching their kids.\n\nThe CEO's core message is straightforward: \"Find your 'why.'\"\n\nOne of his sons has already put that advice into action, leaving a broadcasting job in Lexington, Kentucky, to pursue a path as a pastor.\n\nSimmons said it took him 13 years to uncover his own sense of purpose, and \"everything changed\" once he did. Simmons described coming across a desperate father and his two daughters who hadn't eaten in two days. He says it was a defining moment that \"wrecked him\" and made him realize his purpose.\n\n\"It unlocked something in me. My 'why' is hungry,\" the CEO said, adding that he's passionate about about solving food insecurity and also drawn to the mindset of a hungry leader.\n\nSimmons, who has been with Elanco for over three decades, has centered his life around that passion. The company is focused on changing animal care through innovation and helping farmers improve animal health while reducing their environmental footprint. Roughly a decade ago, Simmons founded Hatch for Hunger, an organization that delivers protein-rich meals to those in need.\n\nThe nonprofit is about to hit 100 million meals given this year, an Elanco spokesperson told Business Insider. To fuel his drive to help leaders, he also serves as the chairman of EDGE Mentoring, a mentoring organization.\n\nSimmons said he loves \"hungry leaders,\" and when he sees that trait in someone else, it evokes an emotional response in him.\n\n\"When somebody finds their 'why,' they will go places they couldn't imagine going,\" Simmons said.\n\nIn addition to teaching his kids to find what motivates them, Simmons said he believes in the power of working hard. He said his family even had a bumper sticker last year that said: \"We can do hard things.\"\n\nThe CEO said that while many students may work during college, they aren't prepared for the stamina required to handle a 14-hour workday or the greater demands of navigating a full-time job.\n\nSimmons said he teaches his kids that there's \"power in the ability to work,\" and that the first five years on the job can make a difference in your career. Simmons said his son, who recently graduated from college and works in Dallas, told him that a number of his friends who graduated in May have already quit their jobs.\n\n\"His playback to me, and I agree with, is they didn't learn the muscle of work,\" Simmons said.\n\nThat mindset also shapes his view on showing up in person early on in your career. While the CEO encourages flexibility in the workplace, he said entry-level employees should \"no question, be in the office,\" if they have the option to be.\n\nHe and his wife also constantly preach the importance of what he refers to as basic social \"hygiene,\" like sending thank-you notes.\n\n\"I think the basics can be forgotten,\" Simmons said.",

    "description": "Andrew Left is headed for a big legal fight in 2026. Business Insider viewed his conversation with Claude to see how he's prepping for the case.",
    "fullText": "Famed short-seller Andrew Left is in the legal fight of his life, set to stand trial in March on allegations of market manipulation and making false and misleading social-media posts about his trading plans.\n\nAs he prepares to battle the feds, one of the places he's gone to for help is Claude. No, that's not the name of his defense lawyer. Claude, in this case, is Anthropic's popular AI chatbot.\n\nBusiness Insider recently got a look at how Left is using artificial intelligence in connection with his criminal case when he included a chat log during an email exchange with us.\n\nIt showed Left peppering Claude with questions and even asking it to draft a letter that his human legal team could, hypothetically, send to the Department of Justice.\n\nIt started with a simple but important question from the outspoken investor behind Citron Research: \"is this good or bad for andrew left\".\n\nLeft, who said he didn't mean to send the chat log to Business Insider, later explained he had uploaded to Claude a document related to his case and wanted a quick, easy-to-understand analysis.\n\n\"If you're ever in a court case, you just get something from the DOJ — instead of reading eight pages, you just put it into AI,\" he said after Business Insider asked him about the log. \"You go, 'What does this mean?'\"\n\nLeft, 55, became something of a market celebrity a decade ago after he raised serious claims about the business practices of Valeant Pharmaceuticals, which was later investigated by federal prosecutors, regulators, and Congress.\n\nHe has also predicted the business woes of companies like Nikola and Hertz, which gave his research reports market-moving sway.\n\nIn filing criminal charges last year, federal prosecutors alleged that Left took trading positions contrary to those market moves in order to reap quick profits. They say he manipulated prices over roughly five years across at least 23 different stocks and made false statements to regulators about coordinating his trades with hedge funds.\n\nThe docket for his case shows seven attorneys who previously or currently represent Left. But Claude, which has been gaining traction with lawyers, apparently came in handy one day last month.\n\nEric Rosen, a partner at Dynamis LLP, one of the firms representing Left, told Business Insider that AI can be valuable as a tool for understanding complex legal materials but cautioned against relying on it too much.\n\n\"It gives you a lot of feedback that you want to hear,\" he said. \"But, you don't know how a judge is going to react to some of these arguments.\"\n\nAlthough Business Insider only saw a portion of Left's conversation with Claude, it was clear that the document he uploaded had something to do with Nvidia. That made sense since the federal indictment alleges Left took a bullish position in the chipmaker's stock in November 2018, tweeted a lofty price target for it, then sold shares hours later, after they spiked.\n\nIn an answer to Left's query about the document, Claude had what sounded like good news, saying it revealed \"critical weaknesses\" in the government's case that was \"potentially very good\" for him.\n\nIt then listed four \"major problems\" with the Justice Department case and offered four \"best defenses\":\n\nLeft volleyed back at the chatbot, playfully patting himself on the back — and Claude gave him positive reinforcement.\n\nThe chatbot then singled out a specific thing that Left had tweeted, that Nvidia would reach \"$165 before $120.\" (It was at about $144 at the time.) Claude pointed out that the stock actually bottomed out at $124 in December before rising to $160 by June 2019.\n\n\"You were spectacularly right at a critical inflection point,\" the chatbot reassured Left.\n\nIn the same response, Claude broke down what it sees as the \"real issue\":\n\nLeft's next two prompts dealt with a stock split announced by Nvidia. The end goal of his inquiries was to show that — factoring in splits — he was directionally correct with his bullish price target on Nvidia stock.\n\nAfter Claude laid out an analysis reassuring Left that his Nvidia forecast was ultimately correct, he followed up with:\n\nAnd then here's what Claude said about the \"legal implication\":\n\n(Note that the supposed 1,300% gain is based on an incorrectly calculated current stock price for Nvidia. It is trading at around $176 a share, not the split-adjusted $1,931 used by Claude.)\n\nLeft wasn't done. He asked Claude to put all his responses into a letter addressed to the DOJ from his attorney. His only suggestion was to make it \"not AI sounding.\"\n\nAfter it returned a roughly 250-word block of text, Left had another edit:\n\nThat got it down to about 150 words. What next?\n\nEver-obedient, Claude spat out this:\n\nMatthew Cain, whose name surfaced when Claude analyzed the document, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLeft said that for him, the AI served as a kind of thought partner.\n\n\"I was writing because I wanted to figure out, as we were going into this case and my attorneys met with the Department of Justice, how to try and explain it,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nLeft noted that he'd seen the AI misinterpret the law, but he does not worry about the chatbot's hallucinations.\n\n\"I run all ideas to just see the other side of the argument,\" he said. \"It definitely opens your mind up, but you cannot rely on it for matters of law.\"\n\nAnthropic, the makers of the Claude chatbot, did not respond to Business Insider's request for a comment. The Justice Department also did not comment.\n\nIt's not clear if Claude's text for a letter ever made its way to Left's defense team or to prosecutors, but he didn't sell it short to us. In fact, he told Business Insider that Claude is his favorite AI.",

    "title": "Behind a $3.2 billion heads fund's closure: How rivals are circling talent and its prized risk system",
    "description": "Many of Eisler's portfolio managers have already found homes at onetime rival funds.",
    "fullText": "Shutting down a hedge fund isn't as simple as turning off the lights and handing the office keys to the building manager.\n\nTrades need to be wound down slowly to make sure backers don't lose money in a fire sale. Employment contracts with payouts and deferred compensation need to be honored. Anything worth selling needs to find a buyer.\n\nAt $3.2 billion Eisler Capital, the London-based multistrategy fund founded by Goldman Sachs veteran Ed Eisler, the firm's late September letter to investors about liquidating the firm was just the first step.\n\nThe firm had transformed itself from a macro shop into a fund with dozens of different teams trading their own specialities and had ambitious goals. In a conversation with Business Insider at the end of 2023, Eisler's COO, Chris Milner, said the manager had increased head count by more than 40% that year and had \"a lot of support from our capital partners and the Street right now and don't feel constrained.\"\n\n\"What we don't want to do is grow for growth's sake. Against that, though, we are an ambitious organization,\" Milner said.\n\nUnfortunately, 2023 was a high point for the firm. The firm made 3% in 2024, trailing its larger multistrategy peers, as costs mounted. Key moneymakers Adrien Delattre and Lewis Morton left the firm despite being named partners at the end of 2023.\n\n\"The challenge of attracting and retaining experienced money managers capable of deploying capital at scale within a cost structure acceptable to investors has grown significantly,\" the firm told investors in its letter.\n\nCompared to the typical fund liquidation, Eisler has the ongoing attention of the industry due to its high head count and a possible sale of some of the firm's intellectual property.\n\nIn talking with backers of the firm, people close to the manager, and industry experts, Business Insider has pulled together the latest on the firm's potential sale of its risk system, Photon, the portfolio manager rival funds are trying to hire, and where some of the fund's investing talent has already landed.\n\nThe manager declined to comment.\n\nWhile Eisler's returns lagged behind those of its peers in 2025, with a loss of 1.7% through August, the firm's risk and analytics system, developed by Eisler and his right-hand man, Sam Wisnia, was known throughout the industry as well-designed. One person at a rival fund said Eisler's macro background gave the system a unique feel compared to others in the industry, which were made with long-short equity or quant trading in mind.\n\nMultistrategy funds, the sprawling giants that have come to define this era of the industry, are hyper-focused on risk, given the key part of their pitch to large institutional investors: We can make money in any market environment.\n\nWhile the cutthroat, immediate firings for any PM who loses 3% are not as common due to the talent war, these firms use a host of systems and tools to monitor the exposures and risks of each trading team, ensuring that no one portfolio drags down the entire fund. Eisler's Photon is considered to be one of the best for tracking macro risks.\n\nSeveral people said the firm has had conversations with funds such as Verition and Taula Capital about buying the system, which is named Photon. Verition and Taula declined to comment.\n\nTwo LPs of the fund told Business Insider that they are frustrated that the money made from the potential sale of the system will not be distributed to them, but instead will go to Eisler and Wisnia. These backers feel entitled to a share of the proceeds from any sale, given that their pass-through fees covered the development of Photon.\n\nA person close to the firm said that Eisler's legal documents with investors clearly give the ownership of intellectual property, such as Photon, to the founder.\n\nIn late 2023, in an effort to keep top talent at the firm, Eisler named four new partners. A little over a year later, three of them, including the aforementioned Delattre and Morton, had departed the fund — an ominous sign for how top performers viewed the manager's future.\n\nThe one new partner who stayed with the firm through its closing is now one of the most coveted potential hires for rivals, according to business development executives at two different multistrategy funds.\n\nMassimiliano Pignatelli is a Milan-based portfolio manager who joined Eisler in 2020 after a stint on a trading desk for Macquarie in London. His resume includes a decade-long stint at French bank Société Générale, where he was the head of European Forward Trading, a type of derivative trading.\n\nWhile he's worked in different European cities in his career, including Paris, the Italy native relocated to Milan while at Eisler. The financial center in northern Italy has become a haven for London's wealthy fleeing the United Kingdom's high tax regime.\n\nHe did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nPignatelli is far from the only Eisler talent in demand.\n\nWith more than 250 people across nine offices in the US, Europe, and the Middle East, the manager had a significant staff despite its relatively low asset base.\n\nDespite a potential 30% cut to their bonuses if they left the fund immediately, Eisler executives and PMs have already started popping up at other funds. Below are some of the individuals who have already made a move, according to media reports, LinkedIn profiles, and industry sources.",

    "description": "High-fiber, cheap, and a vessel for flavor, the humble cabbage is popping up on menus and in Pinterest searches.",
    "fullText": "After decades of terrible PR (think: WWII boiled cabbage recipes and The Cabbage Soup Diet of the '80s), cabbage — the cheap, high-fiber, low-calorie vegetable — is quietly gaining cultural capital.\n\nA recession indicator? Maybe. But also, likely a result of our obsession with health, longevity, and the gut microbiome.\n\nPeople are looking for ways to eat more fiber, support their gut health, and eat more plants without blowing their budget, Rob Hobson, a registered nutritionist and author of \"The Low Appetite Cookbook,\" told Business Insider.\n\n\"In a world of 'fibre-maxxing' and fermented foods trending on social feeds, it makes perfect sense that cabbage is having a moment,\" said Hobson, who predicts fiber will overtake protein as the trendiest nutrient next year.\n\nOf course, kimchi, the fermented Korean cabbage dish, has been a staple of cosmopolitan American food culture since at least the 2010s.\n\nBut, whether you've noticed it or not, the data shows that interest in cabbage appears to be growing once again. Hispi cabbage (known in the US as sweetheart cabbage) is a mainstay of trendy restaurants across London.\n\nChefs at some of the city's buzziest kitchens, including Rochelle Canteen, Ottolenghi, and Fallow, told the New York Times of their love for the conical leafy green in August for a story headlined: \"London's Sexiest Produce Star Is a Cabbage.\" It's used in all sorts of cuisines ranging from Sri Lankan to Middle Eastern to British.\n\nIt's an \"ultimate vessel for flavor,\" Will Murray, a chef and founder of Fallow, which is known for its steaks and Sunday roast, told the outlet. The current cabbage dish on the restaurant's menu is confit smoked cabbage with miso butter, pickled walnuts, and chestnuts.\n\nCabbage is making headway on US menus, too. The number of menu items mentioning \"cabbage\" grew 20.65% year on year between October 2023 and October 2025, led by Mexican restaurants, according to data that Tastewise, a food and drink market research agency, shared with Business Insider. The dataset included 636,366 cabbage menu items across 166,984 restaurants and 8,543 chains, plus 24,023 cabbage items across 5,070 schools.\n\nOnline, people are searching for cabbage recipes: From September 2024 to August 2025, Pinterest searches for cabbage dumplings spiked by 110%, searches for glomupki soup, a Polish dish that consists of cabbage and ground beef in a tomato broth, rose by 95%, and cabbage alfredo, a lower-carb version of the pasta dish, was searched for 45% more, according to the platform's 2026 Pinterest Predicts report.\n\nThis affordability and versatility make it appealing to today's bold-flavor seeking consumer, Wesley Allan, a consumer insights analyst at Tastewise, told Business Insider.\n\n\"Today's consumer is more open to exploring global cuisines than ever. Cabbage's versatility comes in handy, as it can be a part of tacos, rice bowls, noodles, and other culturally relevant dishes,\" he said.\n\nWith 84% of US consumers saying wellness is a \"top\" or \"important\" priority in McKinsey & Company's 2025 Future of Wellness survey, \"functional\" foods are king, and cabbage fits the bill.\n\nCabbage \"punches well above its weight in terms of nutritional value,\" Hobson said. It's a rich source of fiber, which supports digestion, and provides fuel for the beneficial bacteria in the gut, vitamin C, which helps protect cells from damage, and vitamin K, which plays a key role in bone health and blood clotting,\" he said. It's also very low in calories, making it appealing for those on a calorie deficit looking to add volume, fiber, and micronutrients to meals.\n\nDean Sherzai, a neurologist and dementia researcher, previously told Business Insider that eating leafy greens — which includes cabbage — is his number one tip for fending off cognitive decline.\n\nWith two servings per day, \"you've significantly reduced inflammation, oxidation, glucose dysregulation, and lipid dysregulation,\" which are hallmarks of many age-related diseases, he said.\n\nGiven its low cost, many health credentials, and ability to take on almost any flavor, what's not to love?\n\n\"If anything, it feels like cabbage has been waiting for its moment,\" Hobson said.",

It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI couldn't believe there was a banana just sitting on the kitchen table. In Korea, having a banana was a big deal, but when I immigrated to New York City at 12, we had fruit and even M&Ms. Everything was so luxurious.\n\nMy mother immigrated to the US in 1963 with less than $100. When she arrived in New York, she started a small, mom-and-pop gift shop. She grew the business through and eventually got her green card. I joined her about eight years later, in the middle of a New York winter. I didn't speak the language, but I felt lucky to be in the US.\n\nMy mother continued to grow her store, expanding into a drugstore and pharmacy. By the early 2000s, she had a business worth tens of millions.\n\nShe was very, very entrepreneurial. Watching her journey inspired me and has carried over even today. I have a lot of her DNA when it comes to business. Now that I'm 66, I'll think, \"I'm just like my mother!\" It's scary.\n\nMy mom's business set the stage for mine. Working in her shop, I saw that beauty products provided a great business opportunity. The products are small, which reduces warehousing and shipping costs. They're consumable, so customers return again and again. And even if the economy is bad, people don't give up on their skin.\n\nI went to college, but I found it difficult to concentrate because I was always thinking about starting my business. Even today, I don't drive much because I get so distracted thinking about running my companies (instead, I use a driver). Eventually, I graduated with a degree in engineering.\n\nRight next to my school, there was a small video rental store. These were the days before Blockbuster. I bought that store when I was 23, and expanded it slowly to sell gifts and cosmetics.\n\nThat was my start in business. Other than my mom, I've never worked for anyone else. That meant I had to learn hard lessons about business structure, processes, and systems on my own.\n\nOver time, I pivoted from retail to research, design, and manufacturing. In 2018, I sold my shares in one company for $53.7 million. In 2021, I sold my company, Farmacy Beauty, for hundreds of millions (I'm not allowed to share the specific amount). I remember being at my computer on December 31st, watching the funds being deposited into my account. I didn't feel anything. I didn't think \"I'm rich now.\" I didn't even go out to dinner to celebrate.\n\nEntrepreneurship has never been about money for me. It's more about the accomplishment and excitement of building something. I remember the first time I was in a room with people who had more credentials than me. I came up with an idea they hadn't considered. That's the first time I realized that I had a different way of thinking about things.\n\nI have a huge amount of money now — I could never spend it all. And yet, when those funds hit my account, I didn't buy a Rolex or a fancy car. I went out and bought another company to run.\n\nRecently, I told an employee that I'm going to retire in three years. She laughed and said I told her the same thing 15 years ago.\n\nI don't think I will ever retire fully. God has given me a talent for being business-minded and good at what I'm doing. I want to utilize that as long as I'm able to.\n\nMy mother was very passionate about giving back, particularly to the Korean American community. I figure the more money I make, the more I can give back. So, why not use this skill?",

    "fullText": "A JetBlue pilot said he nearly had a midair collision with a US Air Force plane on Friday.\n\nFlight 1112 was flying from Curaçao to New York. The island country, which is part of the Netherlands, is about 40 miles off the coast of Venezuela.\n\nAbout 20 minutes after takeoff, the JetBlue pilot contacted Curaçao's air traffic control center.\n\n\"We just had traffic pass directly in front of us, within 5 miles, maybe 2 or 3 miles,\" he said in a recording published by LiveATC.net. He added that it was an Air Force air-to-air refueller.\n\nThe JetBlue Airbus A320 was also only about 600 feet below the military aircraft. The pilot said the latter was at 34,000 feet while the JetBlue plane was passing through 33,400 feet and ascending to 35,000 feet.\n\n\"So we had to stop our climb and actually just descend to avoid hitting them,\" the pilot said.\n\nWhile the distance between the two aircraft gave the plane enough time to maneuver, the pilot was evidently shocked.\n\n\"They don't have their transponder on,\" he said. \"It's outrageous.\"\n\n\"I don't have anything on my scope,\" the controller replied. \"You are totally right, sir.\"\n\nThe pilot then asked the controller to make a note of it, adding: \"We almost had a midair collision up here.\"\n\nTransponders are a vital piece of aircraft equipment, as they send signals to air traffic control centers and to other nearby planes.\n\nThe Traffic Alert and Collision Avoidance System, or TCAS, relies on active nearby transponders to warn both aircraft and, if necessary, provide instructions for them to avoid each other.\n\nHowever, military aircraft may turn off their transponders to remain undetected during sensitive missions.\n\nThe US military has launched air strikes against suspected drug traffickers in the Caribbean Sea amid escalating tensions with Venezuela. It has also deployed thousands of troops and the USS Gerald R. Ford, the world's largest aircraft carrier.\n\nOn November 21, a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) was put in place until the end of December, warning pilots to \"exercise extreme caution\" around Curaçao due to the \"presence of non-identified aircraft operations.\"\n\nLater in November, President Donald Trump posted on Truth Social, saying that pilots should consider the airspace around Venezuela \"to be closed in its entirety.\"\n\nUS Southern Command, which is responsible for military operations in the area, said in a statement shared with Business Insider: \"We are aware of the recent reporting regarding US military aircraft operations in the Caribbean and are currently reviewing the matter.\"\n\n\"Military aircrews are highly trained professionals who operate in accordance with established procedures and applicable airspace requirements,\" it added. \"Safety remains a top priority, and we are working through the appropriate channels to assess the facts surrounding the situation.\"\n\nJetBlue didn't immediately respond to a request for comment sent by Business Insider outside US working hours.",

    "description": "Tanker maintenance workers spend their days crawling in and out of fuel tanks. New tech might make a hard job a little easier.",
    "fullText": "Inside some of the Air Force's oldest refueling aircraft, technicians are crawling through tight, dirty spaces, painstakingly cleaning sealant on fuel tanks and tightening loose rivets.\n\nThey climb into the dark, cramped tanks with little more than a flashlight, some tools, and shaky comms. It can be hard to breathe, the air smells like jet fuel, the fixes aren't always clear, and the punishing work can be dangerous if done wrong.\n\nIt's a job that hasn't changed much in over 50 years, but new gear, including a live-feed video headset and artificial intelligence-enabled technology, is finally bringing it into the 21st century.\n\nThe Integrated Respirator Information System, known as IRIS and developed by MetroStar and ActionStreamer, is speeding up the maintenance process, company officials and Air Force technicians say, and making it safer and more efficient.\n\nTankers are important logistics assets, what the Air Force calls \"silent enablers,\" that support missions by helping keep fighters and bombers airborne for longer than the onboard fuel tanks can sustain alone. For instance, Operation Midnight Hammer, which saw US stealth bombers strike Iran's nuclear site this year, involved dozens of refueling tankers supporting the strike package.\n\nAlthough fighter aircraft like the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter or bombers like the B-2 Spirit get the most attention, tankers like the KC-135 Stratotanker are critical to US and allied airpower. For them to be useful, though, they have to be well-maintained.\n\nIRIS began as an idea from two maintainers who noticed the broader potential of ActionStreamer's live-streaming tech — gear originally built for athletes to capture first-person views during games. The Air Force technicians pursued the concept for years, even as they rotated through new assignments and bases.\n\nThe Air Force had long believed that tools like this could be a major boost for maintainers. There were early forays into video tech in the 2000s, but the \"technology wasn't quite there,\" Master Sgt. Troy French, a former 100th Maintenance Squadron member, told Business Insider. \"An initial phase of this was kind of set up and abandoned because cameras weren't small enough.\"\n\nNow, though, Air Force maintainers based at Royal Air Force Mildenhall, a central refueling base for the US missions in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, have been testing out IRIS.\n\n\"They were, to be honest with you, a little apprehensive to start with,\" ActionStreamer CEO Bob Lento said, noting it was the first significant change to how technicians have done their jobs in years. But by the end of the first week, attitudes had flipped. \"We were taking the cart out of the hangar into a safe area to do some software punch-ups, and they were like, 'Wait a minute, where are you going with that? We need to use that now.'\"\n\nOn a tanker aircraft like the KC-135, there's a hole just big enough for a person to fit through under the wing. It's the access point for the fuel tanks. \"You crawl up there and you contort your body to be able to lie down flat and then put your feet in,\" French said. Inside, it is a tight space with lots of bumps and edges.\n\nThe workers wear heavy protective suits to guard against fuel exposure and keep sweat out of the tanks. They carry a flashlight and breathe through respirators that feed fresh air in from a hose running outside the aircraft.\n\nOutside the aircraft, a support team stands by. One person runs tools to the person inside the tank while another monitors for any hazards or issues.\n\n\"If you need something, sometimes you just have to peel the respirator back, like, 'Hey, I need this extra wrench that I forgot,'\" French said.\n\nThe runner will grab it and bring it to the entry point, screaming into the tank or pulling on the respirator hose to get the technician's attention. \"If you're really deep in the tank, then you have to crawl back to get it from them, and you have to wait there for them to bring it, reducing the amount of time you're actually working.\"\n\nBefore a worker enters the aircraft, they'll know what issues they're looking for. A broken rivet, for instance, along with regular fuel tanker maintenance to keep the aircraft operating. But sometimes they adjust a different part in the wrong area of the refueling aircraft or leave a tool inside the tanker.\n\nThere's a lot of double-checking the work. Steps like removing sealant, cleaning, and putting adhesion in the tank require approval from other team members. It's inherently an hourslong job made even longer by wait times and communication lags.\n\nAnd that's if it all runs smoothly. Sometimes, technicians make mistakes, extending the time. \"A simple sealant job can turn from a couple of hours of scraping and then eventually reapplying to another day because it turned out that you applied it to the wrong spot,\" Tech Sgt. Chris Anderson, with the 100th Air Refueling Wing, said. \"The way that we did things left a lot of room for error.\"\n\nA logical fix, Frank said, was something wearable: \"a camera with two-way audio would be awesome, and if it had lights, that'd be a second bonus.\"\n\nThe IRIS technology sits on top of the face mask tanker maintenance workers wear. It features a high-definition video camera, a two-way comms system that goes inside the mask, and a hands-free light. IRIS shows everything the technician is looking at to those outside the fuel tank and allows them to communicate with their team.\n\nIt connects to a mobile workstation outside the aircraft. On the cart, which can host up to four IRIS units simultaneously, the support team can see what the technician sees, talk them through the work, and record the footage.\n\nVideo records help verify what each shift completed and resolve disputes quickly. For instance, Anderson said that the day shift had cleared a fuel puddle, but the next shift found one and questioned the work. IRIS showed that the first team had done the job, revealing, as French said, \" another problem, something's leaking.\" That prevented unnecessary rework and let them fix the issue.\n\nIn the past, a tricky aircraft issue could halt work while the right Air Force experts traveled in to assess it. Now, IRIS can send video to them instantly or launch a group call so everyone can see exactly what the technician sees.\n\nDevelopers also see AI playing a growing role in streamlining the job. As a technician uses IRIS, an AI agent compiles images and data to make requests, anticipate needed work, and handle forms. That frees technicians from what retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Cedric George called \"shallow work,\" so when their shift ends, \"all he or she has to do is button up, clean up, go home.\"\n\nIRIS is currently in use only at Mildenhall, but early results are promising, as the Air Force considers expanding it to other bases. Technicians using the system haven't had any safety incidents, and inspections are running 60% faster in test environments, according to pilot evaluations and internal logs. Based on KC-135 maintenance baselines, MetroStar estimates IRIS could save 35,000 maintainer hours and add more than 7,000 aircraft availability days.\n\nGeorge attributed the success of IRIS to the technicians who wanted to revamp the decades-old process to make it better for future workers. \"This is not for the faint of heart, it's dirty work,\" he said, saying current technicians who worked on IRIS believe future maintainers \"have to have something better than what we have now.\"",

    "title": "Use the 'Action Method' When You Need Extra Motivation to Meet Your Goals",
    "description": "This method is all about reimagining your to-do list.",
    "fullText": "When you’re jumping into a complex project, it can be hard to know where to begin—but not if you’re using the “action method,” a productivity technique that requires you to view everything you do as a project. A “project” could be cleaning your house, presenting in a meeting, or answering all of your lingering emails. Basically, it's any larger task that can be broken down into smaller ones, whether personal or professional. The aim of this change in your mindset is to provide a structure for every task you need to complete, so you spend less time battling disorganization.\n\nWhen you have a bunch of little tasks to do, it's easy to lose sight of the larger goals you have. Creating projects aimed at inching closer to those goals will not only help you get more done, but help you stay focused. Here’s why it makes sense to reframe your thinking around projects, and how to make the action method work for you.\n\nAs noted, the action method seeks to help you increase your productivity and work more effectively by organizing your daily tasks, as well as your longer-term goals, into projects, then breaking those projects down into actionable steps. The basic framework comes from Scott Belsky, who laid out the method in his 2010 book Making Ideas Happen: Overcoming the Obstacles Between Vision and Reality.\n\nThe action method was born when Belsky, a co-founder of Behance, sought to help creative professionals tackle inefficiency, disorganization, and the overall chaos of careers being controlled by bureaucracy. The intent behind it is to not only organize your ideas, but to develop a plan of action to execute on them.\n\nThe name \"action method\" hints at that, but it's a little more involved than other action-based productivity techniques like \"eat the frog\" or the two-minute rule. With those methods, your overarching directive is to dive in on major tasks right away, and with relatively little thought. They are, in essence, about action—but the action method itself involves more planning, as counterintuitive as that might seem.\n\nThe “action” part of the action method comes after you organize your projects into three categories: Action steps, references, and back-burners. A good way to do this is to make a spreadsheet with three columns, one for each category, and a different spreadsheet tab for each project.\n\nAction steps are the specific tasks you need to get done, and ones that have actions behind them—like the steps it takes to prepare a presentation or clean the living room. If your overall goal is to clean the house before your mother-in-law arrives in five days, your action steps might include buying materials you're low on or structuring a schedule for how and when you'll tackle different rooms.\n\nReferences covers any extra information you need to accomplish those tasks, like articles that provide background research, emails detailing what needs to be done, or tutorials you plan to take; paste in or drops links to these materials here. With the cleaning example, this might include a checklist or a shopping list.\n\nBack-burners are more nebulous goals that don’t need to be accomplished right now and can be lofty, but should use the action items as a foundation. For instance, if the goal of the presentation in your action column is to secure a new client, a back-burner can be to secure 10 new clients by year’s end. Cleaning the whole house and keeping it clean can be a back-burner, too. By designating back-burners upfront, you keep the momentum going. You're not just cleaning before your MIL gets there, in this case, but laying the foundation to maintain an all-around cleaner home long after she departs and using her arrival as the actionable jumping-off point. Eventually, longer-term, more sustained cleaning projects will replace the more immediate ones in your \"action\" and \"references\" tabs.\n\nYou can take the method offline if you’re a person who works better using a physical daily planner, but your spreadsheet will suffice as long as you check it every day and use it as motivation to get started and keep up with your action items. You can always add more tabs as you get things done, plus add new references and back-burners related to the goals on each existing tab, but the key is to monitor your actionable tasks and, after clearly outlining how they tie into broader goals, get moving on them right away. If you need additional motivation, the spreadsheet provides an easy summary of how they relate to your bigger-picture plans.\n\nIn this way, the method shows you the exact steps you need to take immediately to cross an item off of your list, but also illustrates how those efforts ladder up to your larger goals—but there are some potential pitfalls to keep in mind. For example, it doesn’t help you prioritize between projects. For that, fold in a prioritization technique like the ABC Method or Forster’s Commitment Inventory, which can help you determine which projects and steps to tackle first. Also, knowing what needs to be done is only half the battle, so familiarize yourself with concepts like the Yerkes-Dodson law, which dictates when you will feel most productive in relation to your deadlines, so you can slot in your action steps when they make the most sense.",

We can go from 80 [metres] or we can go from five metres.\n\n\"I'm really happy we kept the intensity up, especially being that far ahead at half-time.\n\n\"I'm gutted we let them in a couple of times but we can't fault the fight. It was very positive.\"\n\nBristol, fifth in the Prem, return to league action at Harlequins on Saturday, 20 December (18:00 GMT).\n\nNext up in the Champions Cup is a trip to South Africa to face Bulls on 10 January, 2026, with the Bears rounding off the pool stage with a home fixture against Bordeaux eight days later.\n\nBristol: Elizalde; Ravouvou, Janse van Rensburg, Williams, Boshoff; Jordan, Marmion; Genge, Oghre, Chawatama, Rubiolo, Batley, Owen, B Grondona, Harding.\n\nReplacements: Thacker, Woolmore, Halliwell, S Grondona, Ivanishvili, Wolstenholme, Worsley, Carrington.\n\nPau: Luc; Grandidier Nkanang, Brau-Boirie, Valentino, Carol; Mondinat, Robson; Bibi Biziwu, Rey, Tokolahi, Jolmes, Capelli, Kpoku, Paul, Tuipulotu.\n\nReplacements: Delhommel, Seneca, Zabala Arrieta, Picquette, Credoz, Souverbie, Decron, Hewat.\n\nReferee: Eoghan Cross (Ireland)\n\nAssistant referees: Robbie Jenkinson (Ireland) and Padraic Reidy (Ireland)",

Having been the player to score the equaliser he was able to reflect on how he has managed to change opinions.\n\nBefore the last international break, he had only scored one goal for his new club Leeds United.\n\nThe knives were out and plenty of Leeds supporters may have been fearing a repeat of the 28-year-old's final season for Everton, in which he scored just three goals in an injury-hit campaign.\n\nBut since the Premier League returned in mid-November the Englishman has been on a mission, netting four goals in five games, including strikes in each of his past four matches.\n\nHis latest goal was a perfectly timed header into the far corner to rescue a draw for Leeds at Brentford and take his side three points clear of the relegation zone.\n\nAfter scoring for the 62nd time in the Premier League on Sunday, Calvert-Lewin told Sky Sports: \"I'm feeling good. I think the performances are speaking for themselves at the moment,\n\n\"For me, it was always about being mentally tough and hanging in there at certain points and step-by-step, day-by-day putting performances together and all of a sudden the tide starts to turn and you start scoring goals. That is the life of a centre forward.\n\n\"In football, as a player you have to control the controllables and the moment you start letting the external stuff bother you that's when you can get yourself in a rut.

What it means to me could be completely different to someone else.\n\n\"It's just trying to fight in every situation that you find yourself in and understanding the situation and what you feel is required for your team.

    "fullText": "A United Airlines flight bound for Tokyo was forced to return to Washington Dulles International Airport on Saturday after losing power in one of its engines shortly after takeoff, triggering a brush fire on the ground and prompting a federal investigation. The Boeing 777-200 was carrying 275 passengers when the incident occurred, according to the airline.\n\nUnited Flight 803 departed Dulles around 12:35 p.m. en route to Tokyo’s Haneda Airport. After the engine issue was detected, the aircraft circled the area for just under an hour before landing safely back at Dulles. United said there were eight crew members aboard and no injuries were reported.\n\nU.S. Transportation Secretary Sean P. Duffy said in a post on X that a piece of the jet’s engine cover broke off after takeoff, sparking a brush fire near the runway. He added that the Federal Aviation Administration will investigate the incident.\n\nI've been briefed on United Flight 803 from Dulles to Japan. \n\nHere’s what we know:\n -An engine failed on the Boeing 777-200ER shortly after take-off\n -275 passengers, 15 crew members on board\n -A piece of the engine cover separated and caught fire, sparking a brush fire on… https://t.co/IxkFJU2Fes\n\n— Secretary Sean Duffy (@SecDuffy) December 13, 2025\n\nEmily McGee, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority, said the fire was quickly extinguished and that airport fire and rescue crews evaluated the aircraft after it returned. Smoke from the brush fire was visible across the tarmac as other flights continued arriving and departing.\n\nThe incident briefly disrupted operations at Dulles and drew the attention of passengers across the airport.\n\nHouman David Hemmati, a California-based ophthalmologist, was seated on a separate United flight bound for Los Angeles when his pilot announced a ground stop.\n\n“We are on a ground stop,” the pilot told passengers, Hemmati said. “There’s an incident on the runway.”\n\nLooking out his window, Hemmati said he saw thick smoke rising near the runway, illuminated by flashing emergency vehicles. He took photos and posted on X, writing, “Praying it’s not a crash.”\n\nHemmati’s flight was later diverted to another runway and allowed to depart around 1 p.m. As the plane climbed, he said smoke was still visible below.\n\nCommercial aircraft are designed to fly safely on a single engine, particularly during critical phases like takeoff. Pilots train extensively for engine failures, and standard protocol typically calls for returning to the departure airport when a problem occurs shortly after liftoff.\n\nKey details from the incident include:\n\nFlight: United Airlines Flight 803\n\nPassengers: 275 passengers and eight crew members\n\nIssue: Loss of power in one engine after takeoff\n\nGround impact: Engine cover debris sparked a brush fire\n\nOutcome: Safe return to Dulles with no reported injuries\n\nNext step: FAA investigation underway\n\nUnited praised the response of its crews and airport personnel in a statement released Saturday.\n\n“United is grateful to our crews and to the teams at Washington Dulles for their quick work to help ensure the safety of everyone involved,” the airline said. United added that it is working to rebook passengers on a later flight.\n\nThe FAA has not released details on what caused the engine cover to detach or whether the aircraft had any prior maintenance issues. Investigators are expected to examine flight data, maintenance records, and debris from the engine as part of the inquiry.\n\nThe Boeing 777 remains one of the most widely used wide-body aircraft in international travel, but any engine-related issue shortly after takeoff draws immediate scrutiny from regulators.\n\nFor passengers aboard Flight 803, the incident ended without injury but with a tense delay to an already long journey. For United and federal investigators, the focus now turns to determining what failed and whether any broader inspections are needed.\n\nThe FAA’s findings will ultimately determine whether the incident was an isolated mechanical failure or part of a larger concern.",

    "fullText": "As the exam regulator consults about introducing onscreen exams amid complaints of hand fatigue, a young aspiring journalist goes head-to-head with a self-professed expert\n\nThis week it was reported that students could soon be sitting their end-of-year exams on laptops after pupils complained of hand fatigue, saying their muscles “are not strong enough”.\n\nWith Ofqual preparing to launch a public consultation on the introduction of onscreen exams, we decided to conduct a test of our own, pitting the Guardian columnist Zoe Williams, a seasoned hack of the pen-and-paper generation, against George Francis Lee, our gen-Z journalist in training.\n\nArmed with only a pad, pen and a media law textbook to copy from – we set out to discover who could scribble the longest before cramp set in. It’s a write-off!\n\nI take enormous pride in my ability to use a pen and paper. Though perhaps it’s the most absurd thing to show off about, like flexing that you know how to desalinate sea water using only two spoons, when you have fresh running water throughout the house.\n\nI’ve been pretending to “have” shorthand – it is so dumb, I even like the slightly archaic “have” rather than the less affected “can do” – for so long I can’t even remember whether it was a boast when I started lying about it. Maybe in the 90s everyone could do shorthand, the way everyone could remember their landline number. In fact, I never learned it; what I learned instead is how to write very fast, forever, in the most adverse settings.\n\nThis write-off, in its climate-controlled conditions – a desk, a pen that worked, good light, a spotless notepad – should have been a personal best. I’ve knelt on wet municipal paving bricks outside magistrates courts, I’ve written a quote on my own hand. One time I was interviewing at an Australian speed-dating night in Alexandra Palace, ran out of paper, ripped some from the hands of a guy who’d just finished snogging and as I walked off, he said “but that had her phone number … ” Only I can ever decipher what I’ve written, which is fine, because only I need to. In that sense, it’s a lot like shorthand.\n\nIt holds so much meaning for me, this writing with a pen, and I’ve been doing it so long, that naturally I am incredibly fast and good at it, except it turns out I’m not. I’m no faster than George, from the “what’s this thing? Which end do you use?” generation; I’m just much more flamboyant and triumphant when I turn the page.\n\nIt’s true that I don’t get hand strain, or any of the other shooting pains that digital natives complain of, but that could equally be because all the associations I have with fast handwriting are very adrenalised: sitting exams; writing emotional letters; taking notes in my resistance-movement meetings in order to memorise then eat them. Maybe the pain happened afterwards, and I didn’t notice because my elbow hurts anyway.\n\nLonghand differs from a recording device, not in accuracy but in the intercession of this quaint little thing called “your brain”. It can pick out immediately the interesting and unusual thing in a sea of ums and ahs and cliches. It will hear the words that make that person unlike any other person (unless they’re a politician, they don’t really do idiosyncrasy). As disappointed as I am, that I’ve pinned my identity to handwriting only to be the same as a gen Z except messier, I will not stop doing it.\n\nThe ballpoint pen feels spindly in my hand and the blank, lined paper in front of me conjures up the primal fear of GCSEs. I swallow hard. It’s the irrational “my entire life hinges on whatever falls upon the A4 sheet” sort of dread that you don’t expect to be subjected to on a random weekday afternoon.\n\n I’m being tested on my handwriting – to see how much I can write and how long for. Just pen and paper, old-school style – no big deal. But this feels different from pitting my wits against an exam paper. I’ve been tasked with taking on a seasoned industry hack with more experience of note-taking than I do of breathing. Me, a spritely gen-Z journalist in the making, versus Guardian legend and scribbler-in-chief, Zoe Williams.\n\n With the news that students in the near future may sit certain GCSE and A-level exams on a laptop because young people are losing the ability to write for long periods, a generational scribing match has been arranged to test our mettle and our hand muscles. \n\n Speaking of hands, we shake ours before starting a 10-minute timer. I zoom into the preface of the 27th edition of McNae’s Essential Law for Journalists and begin. Seconds pass and I can’t help but see my opponent scrawling in long, bending roulettes. She moves with the speed of a 10th-century scrivener, in a script that looks as unfamiliar as Beowulf. Then I look to my page, words still on the first line, tightly formed letters distributed equally for maximum legibility.\n\nI hear a page turn. Somehow, I’m barely a few sentences in and my foe is on a clean sheet. I shift into gear, legibility be damned. I write with reckless abandon, spilling across lines. It’s probably three minutes before my hand starts to ache, not much later until it starts to properly cramp – right at that fleshy bit at the base of the thumb.\n\nAnother page turns. I curse McNae’s, I curse not journaling more, I curse the invention of the notes app on my iPhone. I curse it all. But I push on, though not without a meek admission that my hand, indeed, hurts.\n\n The timer finally rings, and I drop the pen like it’s hot iron. I’m surprised to find that, by the end, I’d nearly caught Zoe. Still, I have lost – the competition but not the respect of my adversary, who is magnanimous in victory. Perhaps we should arrange a rematch on a smartphone, I think – or maybe I should have squeezed a bit harder during that handshake.",

    "fullText": "Outside the lavish event, workers called out the ‘greed’ in the industry that has left games ‘being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money’\n\nIt’s the night of the 2025 Game Awards, a major industry event where the best games of the year are crowned and major publishers reveal forthcoming projects. In the shadow of the Peacock theater in Los Angeles and next to a giant, demonic statue promoting new game Divinity, which would be announced on stage later that evening, stands a collection of people in bright red shirts. Many are holding signs: a tombstone honouring the “death” of The Game Awards’ Future Class talent development programme; a bold, black-and-red graphic that reads “We’re Done Playing”; and “wanted” posters for Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick and Microsoft CEO Phil Spencer. This is a protest.\n\nThe protesters, who were almost denied entry to the public space outside the Peacock theater (“they knew we were coming,” one jokes), are from United Videogame Workers (UVW), an industry-wide, direct-join union for North America that is part of the Communications Workers of America. “We are out here today to raise awareness of the plight of the game worker,” says Anna C Webster, chair of the freelancing committee, in the hot Los Angeles sun. “Our industry has been strip-mined for resources by these corporate overlords, and we figured the best place to raise awareness of what’s happening in the games industry is at the culmination, the final boss, as it were: The Game Awards.”\n\nWebster is referencing several things here. More than 40,000 layoffs have decimated the industry over the past few years; just last month, Grand Theft Auto developer RockstarGames was accused of union-busting after firing more than 30 staff (the studio denies this, saying the employees were leaking confidential information), and AI is being rapidly injected into game development processes. The industry seems unwilling to reckon with these issues.\n\n“I recently read that a three-minute trailer at The Game Awards costs more than $1m,” says the union’s local secretary, Kaitlin “KB” Bonfiglio. “[Despite] the pomp and circumstance of all of this, they never seem to acknowledge the historic amount of layoffs that have happened in the industry.”\n\nFor the UVW, there is a core issue here. “It’s all about greed,” Webster insists. “Anyone who works in the games industry can identify that our art form is being sold for parts to make a few people a lot of money. And they don’t care about the games. They don’t care about the art. They just want their money.”\n\nFor those working in games, the problems plaguing the industry are obvious. But how can UVW make it clear that the issues industry workers face affect players, too? “If you’re someone who loves video games, if you are frustrated by games that launch buggy and are delayed messes, if you’re frustrated by games you’re excited about getting cancelled without warning, all of that ties back to what we’re doing here,” treasurer Sherveen Uduwana says. “Giving us layoff protections, making sure bosses can’t take away our healthcare, making sure they can’t replace us with AI – that is going to lead to better games for players and more ambitious, interesting, creative projects. It’s really a win-win for players and a win-win for workers.”\n\nThere’s a clear love for the industry permeating through this group, a desire to make the medium and the work they cherish even better. The Game Awards is a major night, one that can help prop up smaller independent studios and highlight incredible voice actors. The UVW team recognises that.\n\n“Have a good time today, and tomorrow, let’s wake up and start organising for better workers’ rights and a better games industry,” Uduwana says.",

    "fullText": "He rewrote the rule book with Rockstar then left it all behind. Now Dan Houser is back with a storytelling-focused studio to take on AI-obsessed tech bros and Mexican beauty queens\n\nThere are only a handful of video game makers who have had as profound an effect on the industry as Dan Houser. The co-founder of Rockstar Games, and its lead writer, worked on all the GTA titles since the groundbreaking third instalment, as well as both Red Dead Redemption adventures. But then, in 2019, he took an extended break from the company which ended with his official departure. Now he’s back with a new studio and a range of projects, and 12 years after we last interviewed him, he’s ready to talk about what comes next.\n\n“Finishing those big projects and thinking about doing another one is really intense,” he says about his decision to go. “I’d been in full production mode every single day from the very start of each project to the very end, for 20 years. I stayed so long because I loved the games. It was a real privilege to be there, but it was probably the right time to leave. I turned 45 just after Red Dead 2 came out. I thought, well, it’s probably a good time to try working on some other stuff.”\n\nAt first, he looked into film or TV writing, but didn’t like what he found. “That world was not overly excited by me and I was not overly excited by them,” he says. “I’ve spent 20 years talking about how games are the coming medium and now they are the medium […] you look at TV and the budgets and the amount of money they can generate, but the creative ambition is so small at times”. It seemed to Houser that it would be easier to come at the industry with IP that had already been generated. So he moved to Santa Monica and formed Absurd Ventures, bringing in Greg Borrud (founder of Seismic Games and Pandemic Studios) as head of games and, as COO, Wendy Smith, previously at the New Yorker and Ralph Lauren, and a White House special assistant during Bill Clinton’s presidency.\n\nIt was clear from the start it wouldn’t just be a video games studio. In 2024, the company released the 12-part story podcast A Better Paradise, a dystopian thriller about an ambitious online game world overseen by a powerful AI presence that begins to become sentient – with devastating consequences. Its creator is the mysterious tech billionaire Dr Mark Tyburn, a British inventor who intends the game as a digital utopia, then abandons it when things go awry. In some ways it is a satire on our current digital oligarchy, in which billionaire tech bros wield astronomical influence over society.\n\n“All of these tech companies start out with grandiose ambitions, this ‘we are going to save the world through togetherness’-type gibberish,” he says. “We’ve created some of the most powerful people in history in terms of reach and mind control. Those people end up living with far more money than anyone’s ever had. And it feels, as someone who lives in the society that they have helped create, that there are moments in those journeys when they must have felt their product was not quite what they intended it to be and was doing unforeseen harm, and … they went out of their way to ensure that was not regulated. That Faustian moment I find fascinating, and that’s not to say I wouldn’t make the same choice or judge them for it, I just find it interesting.”\n\nTellingly perhaps, the company at the centre of A Better Paradise, Tyburn Industria, feels much more like a games studio than a social media mega-corp. Also, the lead protagonist is a writer who finds himself at the centre of the game’s development. Is there an element of autobiography here?\n\n“Yeah, of course – at that level,” says Houser. “But I also wanted to write about games and tech in a way that felt authentic. To lean slightly more into the games side in terms of the office environment was really easy for me. I know what it’s like to work in a games company obviously. I wanted to try and bring that to life in a way that felt real and to capture some of the micro dramas.”\n\nHaving turned A Better Paradise into a novel, Houser’s Santa Monica studio is now working on an open-world video game version. He’s not saying how it will fit in with the podcast, just that Mark Tyburn and the AI at the heart of his game, NigelDave (a wildly intelligent program, fixated by humans but with no understanding of how they function), will both figure in the action.\n\nAlso in development at the company’s second studio in San Rafael, is the Absurdaverse, a comedy universe populated by a menagerie of weird characters, from a skeletal warrior to an ageing hippy. The company is planning a series of animated TV shows and/or movies for the concept, but also another open world game, which Houser has described as, “a living sitcom”. Again, he’s vague on the details, but it looks to be a more story-driven take on The Sims, possibly utilising AI to create emergent narratives around the characters and their lives. “We’re trying to use the memories of NPCs in a fun way,” he says. “Just trying to make it a bit more alive. You’ll see when we talk about it more, but it is shaping up really well. It’s a completely gamey game – very mechanics driven. With both games, we’re trying to make them really strong on mechanics, really fun to play, accessible, but plenty of depth.”\n\nHouser is also planning a game around the company’s third IP, the comic book series American Caper, co-written with fellow Rockstar alumnus, Lazlow. With its cast of escaped convicts, crooked lawyers and Mexican beauty queens, it is perhaps the closest out of all his new projects to Grand Theft Auto. Which is perhaps why the interactive version is going in a different direction. “I’m not making an open-world game for that,” says Houser. “We’re actually looking at maybe doing more of a story game. We’re still kind of exploring it.”\n\nWe talk a little bit about the current prevalence of forever games such as Minecraft, Fortnite and Roblox and how they’re sucking up a lot of the world’s playtime. But Houser is adamant that there’s still a vast audience for mature single-player narrative experiences – and that’s what he’s aiming at.\n\n“We’re trying to be ambitious, to make new stuff,” he says. “At some level [our projects] are traditional console games, accessible, but action-oriented story-driven open world console games – but then at the same time, we’re doing it a slightly different way or with slightly different subject matter. Three years ago we were watching one of those PlayStation showcases, and if you blinked and missed the credit sequences, you couldn’t tell where one game ended and the other began. Everything was sort of dark purple and about space ninjas. They were about this apocalypse or that apocalypse but always felt the same.”\n\n“That’s fine. Some of them are amazing games. But we were like, well, we’ve got limited money and we are starting from scratch. We have to have good stories and fun dialogue, and make sure our gameplay is amazing and accessible, and our art direction has to be fresh – at all points, it has to feel different. We have to make stuff where people go, ‘Well, I’ve never played a game about that’, and then treat the audience, not just as gamers, but as human beings.”\n\nSo he’s not worried about the industry’s current obsession with live-service multiplayer mega-games? “I still think there is enough of an audience who want new stuff and single player-led stuff,” he says. And then in his characteristically self-deprecating way he adds: “I hope so. Or we’re in a little bit of trouble.”",

It would also completely end the 2030 ban on new petrol and diesel cars.\n\nA future Conservative government would also scrap all of the non-research and development subsidies associated with the ZEV mandate to “relieve manufacturers of more costly regulatory obligations”, which the party estimates would save £3.8bn over the next decade. Ministers would retain infrastructure funding to continue developing the electric vehicle market.\n\nKemi Badenoch, the leader of the Conservative party, said: “Labour’s rush to net zero is having a disastrous effect on the UK car industry. The Conservatives will ensure that we protect the environment, but we will do so without forcing families to bear the brunt of the costs, and forcing carmakers to meet deadlines that don’t reflect consumer demand.\n\n“By scrapping the ZEV mandate and the ban on petrol cars, we are putting fairness and common sense back into the system and saving money for taxpayers. Britain succeeds when we back business and support innovation – that’s our plan for a stronger economy.”\n\nWriting in the Telegraph, Badenoch said she was inspired by the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and her “commonsense approach to net zero”, which required that “any push to tackle carbon emissions must not degrade Italy’s economy”.\n\nThe previous Conservative government delayed the ban on new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035 in 2023. However, Labour reinstated the ban and will require every new car to be zero-emission by 2035, on the grounds that the timeline will provide certainty to manufacturers and consumers.\n\nThe ZEV mandate is a result of the Climate Change Act and its 2050 net zero duty, which the Conservatives have pledged to repeal.\n\nDoug Parr, the Greenpeace UK policy director, said: “Nothing the Tories suggest is likely to take effect before 2029, one year from when the ban takes effect. A U-turn now would create chaos after years of preparation for electric cars, wasting effort, risking jobs and leaving Britain stuck in reverse while the rest of the world accelerates towards cleaner, cheaper cars.\n\n“If ever a political party wanted to sow confusion and uncertainty into one of Britain’s most important manufacturing industries, this is how you do it. It’s the opposite of what’s needed to cut pollution, lower running costs for drivers and secure long term jobs.\n\n“Chinese electric vehicles will soon be better and cheaper than anything coming out of Europe or the UK. A phaseout date to incentivise UK manufacturing has to be part of the response. Scrapping rules would be a total disaster. It would undermine investment and leave manufacturers facing uncertainty in a rapidly changing global market. The Tories introduced this policy, and they should leave well alone.”\n\nA government spokesperson said: “We remain committed to phasing out all new non-zero emission car and van sales by 2035. More drivers than ever are choosing electric, and November saw another month of increased sales with EV’s accounting for one in four cars sold.\n\n “We’re investing over £7.5bn to support drivers and manufacturers make the switch to zero emission. This includes £4bn investment to back British manufacturing and R&D, create jobs and drive growth in the sector.”\n\n “Our electric car grant is making it cheaper than ever to choose an EV, with over 40,000 drivers saving up to £3,750 since launch, backed by an extra £1.3bn announced at the autumn budget.”",

    "fullText": "Rachel Reeves wants to protect consumers by bringing digital money and assets into the ‘regulatory perimeter’\n\nCryptocurrencies will be regulated in a similar way to other financial products under legislation coming into force in 2027.\n\nThe Treasury is drawing up rules that will require crypto companies to meet a set of standards overseen by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\n\nMinisters have sought to overhaul the crypto market, which has ballooned in popularity as a way of investing money and making payments.\n\nCryptocurrencies have not been subject to the same regulation as traditional financial products such as stocks and shares, which means that in many cases consumers do not enjoy the same level of protection.\n\nThe government said the new rules would make the crypto industry more transparent, boost consumer confidence and make it easier to detect suspicious activity, impose sanctions and hold companies accountable.\n\nRachel Reeves, the chancellor, said: “Bringing crypto into the regulatory perimeter is a crucial step in securing the UK’s position as a world-leading financial centre in the digital age.\n\n“By giving firms clear rules of the road, we are providing the certainty they need to invest, innovate and create high-skilled jobs here in the UK, while giving millions strong consumer protections, and locking dodgy actors out of the UK market.”\n\nCrypto companies, which can include crypto exchanges and digital wallets, must register with the FCA if they provide services that fall within the scope of the UK’s money-laundering regulations.\n\nThe changes mooted by the Treasury will bring companies that provide crypto services into the remit of the FCA and mean the services are regulated in the same way as other financial products, including by being subject to transparency standards.\n\nLucy Rigby, the minister for the City of London, said: “We want the UK to be at the top of the list for crypto assets firms looking to grow and these new rules will give firms the clarity and consistency they need to plan for the long term.”\n\nThe cryptocurrency market has suffered from turbulence amid growing investor fears about a potential artificial intelligence bubble.\n\nBanking industry data in October showed that the amount of money lost to investment scams by UK consumers had surged by 55% in a year, with fake cryptocurrency thought to top the list.\n\nA Chinese woman living in the UK was convicted in September over a multibillion-pound bitcoin fraud.\n\nZhimin Qian, also known as Yadi Zhang, orchestrated a fraud in China between 2014 and 2017 that left 128,000 people out of pocket. The 45-year-old stored the proceeds in bitcoin but UK authorities made a breakthrough in the case when they raided a Hampstead mansion in 2018 and seized devices from Qian holding 61,000 bitcoins, worth more than £5bn at current prices.\n\nThe Metropolitan police believe it is the largest single cryptocurrency seizure in the world. Qian pleaded guilty at Southwark crown court on Monday to acquiring and possessing cryptocurrency that was criminal property.\n\nMinisters are also drawing up plans to ban political donations made with cryptocurrency, amid concerns that it is difficult to determine their origin and ownership.\n\nNigel Farage’s Reform UK, which became the country’s first party to accept contributions in digital currency this year, is believed to have received its first registrable donations in cryptocurrency this autumn. It has set up a crypto portal to receive contributions, saying it is subject to “enhanced” checks.\n\nReform this month received £9m from Christopher Harborne, a cryptocurrency investor and businessman based in Thailand – the largest donation made by a living person to a British political party.",

    "fullText": "Dec 14 (Reuters) - iRobot (IRBT), the maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner, filed for bankruptcy protection on Sunday, saying that it would go private after being bought by Picea Robotics, its primary ​manufacturer.\n\nThe company, which raised concerns about staying in business in March, filed for Chapter 11 protection ‌in Delaware bankruptcy court as it grapples with increased competition from lower-priced rivals and new U.S. tariffs.\n\niRobot generated about $682 million in total ‌revenue in 2024, but its profits have been eroded by competition from Chinese rivals like Ecovacs Robotics. iRobot remains dominant in key markets like the U.S. and Japan, but competition forced it to lower its prices and make substantial investments in technological upgrades, according to bankruptcy court filings.\n\nNew U.S. tariffs have also harmed the company, especially a 46% ⁠levy on imports from Vietnam, where ‌iRobot manufactures vacuum cleaners for the U.S. market. The tariffs raised the company’s costs by $23 million in 2025, while making it more difficult to plan for the future, according ‍to iRobot's court filings.\n\nThe company, which was the target of a thwarted $1.4 billion buyout by Amazon.com, has about $190 million in debt.\n\nThe debt stems from a 2023 loan that iRobot used to refinance its operations while a European competition investigation stalled the ​Amazon (AMZN) deal.\n\nAfter the Amazon deal fell apart and iRobot fell behind on payments to Picea, the China-based ‌manufacturer acquired iRobot's debt from a group of investment funds managed by the Carlyle Group, according to court documents.\n\nThe stock fell 83% during premarket trading on Monday.\n\nUnder iRobot's bankruptcy plan, Picea will take 100% of the company's equity and cancel the $190 million remaining on the 2023 loan, as well as an additional $74 million debt that iRobot owes to Picea under the companies' manufacturing agreement.\n\nOther creditors and suppliers will be paid in full, according to iRobot's bankruptcy court filings.\n\niRobot said the bankruptcy ⁠is not expected to disrupt its app functionality, customer programs, global ​partners, supply chain relationships or product support.\n\nThe loss-making company was valued ​at $3.56 billion in 2021, driven by pandemic-fueled demand, but it is now worth around $140 million, according to data compiled by LSEG.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three Massachusetts Institute ‍of Technology roboticists. It initially ⁠focused on defense and space work before debuting the Roomba robotic vacuum in 2002.\n\nThe Roomba was an immediate success and it holds about 42% of the U.S. market share and 65% of the Japanese ⁠market share for robotic vacuum cleaners, according to the company.",

    "description": "Researchers believe that a new epoch may have begun on the Moon back in 1959, when humans first affected the surface.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nResearchers believe that a new epoch may have begun on the Moon back in 1959, when humans first affected the surface.\n\nDubbed the “Lunar Anthropocene,” the epoch has now seen over 100 spacecraft visit the Moon, and humans are becoming a dominant force in shaping the surface.\n\nIt is yet to be seen how exactly growing human influence will shape our natural satellite.\n\nWhen humans get involved in places they weren’t invited, things start to change. The Moon is no different.\n\nA team of researchers at the University of Kansas believes that human involvement—including the more than 100 spacecraft interactions we have had with our natural satellite over the past 64 years—makes us one of the most dominant forces shaping the Moon.\n\nThat’s enough, they believe, to declare a new epoch on the Moon—the “Lunar Anthropocene.”\n\nThe researchers published a paper detailing this proposal in the journal Nature Geoscience. In it, they highlight the fact that the Moon is not the unchanging environment barely impacted by humanity that we sometimes think it to be. Since the Soviet Union’s Luna 2 spacecraft first hit the surface in September of 1959, humans have played a key role in the evolution of our closest cosmic companion.\n\n“This idea is much the same as the discussion of the Anthropocene on Earth—the exploration of how much humans have impacted our planet,” Justin Holcomb, the study’s lead author, said in a statement. “The consensus is on Earth the Anthropocene began at some point in the past, whether hundreds of thousands of years ago or in the 1950s. Similarly, on the Moon, we argue the Lunar Anthropocene already has commenced, but we want to prevent massive damage or a delay of its recognition until we can measure a significant lunar halo cause by human activities, which would be too late.”\n\nThe team says that, with over 100 spacecraft touching the Moon—sometimes crash-landing, and sometimes bringing actual humans to the surface—there’s been enough interaction to signify a geological epoch.\n\n“In the context of the new space race, the lunar landscape will be entirely different in 50 years,” Holcomb said, noting how human involvement is already moving sediments and significantly disturbing the surface. “Multiple countries will be present, leading to numerous challenges.”\n\nHolcomb added that the outdoor community’s mantra of “leave no trace” doesn’t exist on the Moon. The list of items already brought to and left on the surface by humans is long, though the abandoned spacecraft are far and away the most impactful in terms of size. The study’s authors claim that various aspects of the Moon—including the delicate exosphere composed of dust and gas, and any ice found in permanently shadowed areas—are susceptible to exhaust gas propagation. “Future missions,” they wrote, “must consider mitigating deleterious effects on lunar environments.”\n\nThe research team hopes to accomplish multiple goals by declaring the Lunar Anthropocene. They want to call attention to the vulnerability of lunar sites, especially considering the current lack of legal or policy protections against destructive disturbance of the Moon. They also want to ensure that each human interaction with and impact on the satellite is well chronicled, and aim to work with archeologists and anthropologists along the way to ensure that recording.\n\n“As archaeologists, we perceive footprints on the Moon as an extension of humanity’s journey out of Africa, a pivotal milestone in our species’ existence,” Holcomb said. “These imprints are intertwined with the overarching narrative of evolution.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "When you're shopping for a car, the engine is basically the heart of the whole operation. You want something that'll start every morning, handle your commute without drama, and still be running strong when you're handing down the keys years later.\n\nSome manufacturers have built their reputations on engines that just refuse to quit, racking up hundreds of thousands of miles like it's nothing. These are the brands that make mechanics smile because they see them so rarely, and the ones that have entire online communities dedicated to their legendary durability.\n\nHere's a look at the automotive companies that have truly mastered the art of building engines that last.\n\nToyota's reputation for reliability isn't just marketing hype — it's backed by decades of engines that simply won't die. The legendary 2JZ inline-six and the more recent 2GR V6 have become icons in the automotive world, with owners regularly posting odometer photos showing 300,000+ miles.\n\nWhat makes Toyota engines special is their conservative engineering approach, where they prioritize longevity over pushing performance boundaries. They use proven technologies, simple designs, and generous tolerances that forgive less-than-perfect maintenance.\n\nThe brand's commitment to reliability is so strong that many taxi and rideshare drivers swear by Camrys and Corollas, knowing they'll rack up miles without constant trips to the shop.\n\nHonda engines have earned a cult following among enthusiasts who appreciate both reliability and a bit of spirited driving. The brand's VTEC technology manages to deliver engaging performance while maintaining impressive longevity, which is a tough balance to strike.\n\nHonda's secret sauce involves meticulous engineering, excellent metallurgy, and a focus on high-revving designs that don't sacrifice durability. Models like the Accord and Civic regularly see 200,000 miles with just routine maintenance, and their engines are known for running smoothly even at high mileage.\n\nThe company's racing heritage translates into engines that love to be driven hard but won't punish you for it with repair bills.\n\nLexus takes Toyota's already impressive reliability and wraps it in luxury packaging with even more refined engineering. Their engines benefit from Toyota's proven platforms but often receive additional quality control measures and premium components.\n\nThe brand consistently ranks at the top of reliability surveys, with owners reporting remarkably few engine issues over long ownership periods. Lexus engines are engineered with such precision that many models feel almost as smooth at 150,000 miles as they did when new.\n\nIt's the rare luxury brand where you don't have to budget for constant repairs, making it a favorite among those who want premium without the premium maintenance headaches.\n\nMazda flies a bit under the radar in reliability discussions, but their Skyactiv engines have proven to be seriously dependable workhorses. The company's obsession with efficiency led them to develop engines that extract maximum performance from every drop of fuel without unnecessary complexity.\n\nTheir naturally aspirated designs avoid some of the potential weak points that come with forced induction, contributing to their longevity. Mazda engines are known for maintaining their peppy character well into high mileage, and the brand's commitment to driving enjoyment means they're fun to own long-term.\n\nOwners often report that regular oil changes and basic maintenance are all these engines need to keep running strong.\n\nSubaru's boxer engines are distinctive in design and have built a loyal following thanks to their durability in challenging conditions. The horizontally-opposed layout provides a lower center of gravity and inherent balance that contributes to smooth operation over time.\n\nSubaru reliability varies by engine family and era; while many modern models perform well, Subaru has had notable historical issues (e.g., earlier head gasket concerns and some oil-consumption complaints), so condition and maintenance matter.\n\nSubaru owners in snowy climates often drive their cars for decades, racking up impressive mileage while tackling conditions that would sideline less robust vehicles.\n\nYou might not immediately think of a sports car brand when discussing reliability, but Porsche engines have a well-earned reputation for longevity. Their flat-six engines, whether air-cooled classics or modern water-cooled variants, are engineered to withstand sustained high-performance driving. Some early water-cooled generations (M96/M97 era) are associated with well-known IMS-bearing concerns, so longevity depends heavily on model year, engine type, and maintenance history.\n\nPorsche approaches engine design with German precision and racing-derived technology that's been tested under extreme conditions. Many Porsche owners track their cars regularly and still see them reach high mileage with proper maintenance.\n\nThe brand proves that performance and reliability aren't mutually exclusive, though you'll want to keep up with that maintenance schedule to enjoy both benefits.\n\nAs Honda's luxury division, Acura benefits from the same engineering philosophy that makes Honda engines legendary. Their powerplants offer refined performance with the peace of mind that comes from Honda's proven reliability track record.\n\nAcura engines typically feature more advanced technologies and premium materials while maintaining the fundamental durability that the parent company is known for. Models like the TLX and MDX combine engaging driving dynamics with engines that owners report running smoothly well past 200,000 miles.\n\nIt's a brand that delivers upscale driving experiences without the typical luxury car reliability concerns.\n\nKia has improved substantially in recent years, particularly with newer Smartstream engines, but some earlier engine families (including Theta II) have been associated with well-documented failures and litigation/settlements.\n\nKia's commitment to quality control has resulted in engines that compete favorably with established Japanese brands in long-term dependability. Their powertrains benefit from parent company Hyundai's engineering resources and a genuine effort to build lasting customer confidence.\n\nThe 10-year/100,000-mile powertrain warranty demonstrates Kia's confidence in their engines' ability to go the distance.\n\nHyundai has improved in recent years and offers strong warranty coverage, but some past engines experienced significant issues; reliability can vary by engine family and model year.\n\nTheir Smartstream engine lineup incorporates advanced technologies while maintaining good durability records among owners. Hyundai engines benefit from conservative tuning that prioritizes longevity, and the brand's generous warranty coverage provides added peace of mind.\n\nModels across their lineup are increasingly showing up in high-mileage club discussions, earning respect from owners who've put them through their paces.\n\nBMW inline-six engines have achieved near-mythical status among enthusiasts for combining performance with surprising longevity. The legendary M50, M52, and more recent B58 engines are known for reaching high mileage when owners stay on top of maintenance.\n\nBMW's engineering excellence shines through in engines that deliver thrilling performance while incorporating robust designs. The key with BMW engines is respecting the maintenance intervals — do that, and you'll likely enjoy a powerplant that stays strong for years.\n\nMany enthusiasts seek out older BMWs specifically for their proven engine designs, knowing these motors can be trusted for the long haul.\n\nFord's workhorse engines, particularly their naturally aspirated V8s and the Duratec four-cylinders, have proven themselves across millions of miles in trucks and cars. The 5.0-liter Coyote V8 has become a modern classic, delivering strong performance while racking up impressive mileage in everything from Mustangs to F-150s.\n\nFord's truck engines especially benefit from over-engineering designed to handle commercial use and heavy loads. While some of their EcoBoost turbocharged engines are still proving themselves long-term, Ford's traditional powerplants have established track records of durability.\n\nThe brand's focus on fleet and commercial applications means they build engines that can take serious abuse and keep running.\n\nChevrolet's small-block V8 legacy speaks volumes about the brand's ability to build engines that last generations. The LS and LT engine families have become icons in the automotive world, known for their simplicity, power, and incredible durability.\n\nThese engines power everything from sports cars to heavy-duty trucks, handling diverse applications with impressive reliability. Chevy's four-cylinder and V6 engines in their passenger cars have also shown good longevity when maintained properly.\n\nThe brand's engines benefit from decades of refinement and a large parts ecosystem that makes keeping them running easier and more affordable than many alternatives.\n\nThe brands on this list have earned their reputations through years of building engines that keep running when others would have given up. What they share is a commitment to sound engineering principles, quality materials, and designs that prioritize longevity alongside performance.\n\nWhether you're looking at a Japanese brand known for conservative engineering, a German manufacturer that refuses to compromise on precision, or an American company building truck engines that can handle anything, these manufacturers understand what it takes to create lasting powertrains.\n\nThe good news for car buyers is that reliable engines are available across price points and vehicle types, so you don't have to sacrifice dependability to get the features or performance you want",

    "fullText": "BUFFALO, N.Y. (WIVB) — Niky Sal, an influencer leading an effort to catch alleged child predators online in Western New York, was hospitalized after being stabbed in his latest encounter in Jamestown.\n\nWIVB News 4 sat down with Niky earlier this month after footage of an earlier encounter at the Walden Galleria in Cheektowaga went viral on social media.\n\nThe effort’s like a modern-day version of the old reality show, “To Catch a Predator.” Alongside his associates, Paul Oyer and Ethan Haskins, Niky operates undercover on social media posing as underage children in an attempt to catch adults who prey upon minors.\n\n“What we do is we have decoy accounts,” Niky said in an earlier interview with News 4. “We kind of just have them there, and we never send the first message. Nine times out of 10, once that first message is sent, it goes downhill very quick, especially once we age-drop and they know how old the minor is.”\n\nNiky explained in our interview earlier this month how this effort, for him, is personal.\n\n“When I was 9 years old I was a victim,” Niky said at the time. “I guess that kind of drove me to do what I do today.”\n\nOn Saturday, things took a violent turn after Niky and his team met up with a man in Jamestown who they say believed he was there to meet a 14-year-old girl.\n\nNiky suffered a large laceration to his arm and ended up in the hospital.\n\n“He was released from the hospital,” Oyers said. “We got back home, and he couldn’t move his fingers, couldn’t move his hand.”\n\nAn artery was severed in the attack, leaving Niky with no feeling in his arm. Now, he needs surgery.\n\n“There’s pretty extensive damage to the arm where he was got,” Haskins said. “We’re kind of worried about that, mobility and things.”\n\nJames Morris, 43, was arrested in connection with the incident on several charges, including first-degree assault, according to Jamestown Police. He was arraigned and remanded to the Chautauqua County Jail.\n\nNow, moving forward, Niky’s team says, while the road to recovery might end up being a long one, once Niky’s back on his feet, there won’t be any slowing him down.\n\n“When we saw him last night at the hospital, at this time there isn’t any signs of it slowing him down, it stopping him,” Haskins said. “We got to get through this recovery thing, and then it’s hit the ground running and keep going and fighting the good fight.”\n\nA gofundme page has been set up to help with medical expenses as Niky continues to recover from his injuries.\n\nRob Petree is an anchor and reporter who joined the News 4 team in 2025.

    "description": "A newly released 40-year study found a concerning problem.",
    "fullText": "Every year, millions of birds migrate thousands of miles from Africa to Europe. This is a massive journey that happens twice a year and depends on timing and the amount of food.\n\nHowever, new research from Durham University and the British Trust for Ornithology shows that birds are struggling to reach their destination.\n\nA study published on Zenodo analyzing 40 years of bird data across 286 sites in Europe found a significant decline in what scientists call \"migratory fuel loads.\"\n\nThese are the fat stores that birds need to cross difficult regions like the Mediterranean Sea and the Sahara Desert.\n\nResearchers examined 33 Afro-Palearctic migratory species and found that birds preparing for their fall migration now carry less weight than in previous years.\n\nHowever, the spring migration did not show the same decline.\n\nAll this suggests that the changing summer conditions are likely the main factor for the decreased weight of these birds.\n\nThe study also found that birds in northern Europe are storing energy earlier than usual, while southern birds are doing so later.\n\nAccording to the research team from the British Trust for Ornithology, these trends could make it harder for birds to complete their long journeys and put pressure on their already declining populations.\n\nMigratory birds play a crucial role in maintaining healthy and strong ecosystems.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nNot only do they control local insect populations through their feeding habits, but they also help disperse seeds and protect crops from pests.\n\nIf their numbers begin to plummet, the effects would threaten major food systems, increase costs for farmers, and weaken natural environments.\n\nIf birds continue to struggle to gather enough energy to migrate, many may fail to complete their journey.\n\nHotter summer conditions are to blame for all of this because they reduce the availability and quality of the insects and fruits that birds rely on to build up their fat reserves.\n\nIncreased heat and drought also dry out habitats, leaving birds struggling to rest.\n\nConservation groups across Europe are working to protect migratory routes, restore habitats, and safeguard common stopover sites.\n\nAs for fighting rising global temperatures altogether, individual efforts can be made every day.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SINGAPORE, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The volume of Venezuelan oil already headed to China before the U.S. seized a Venezuelan tanker last week, plus a glut of crude in storage and weak demand, will limit ​the near-term impact of the move in the Chinese market, traders and analysts said.\n\nExports from the South American producer have ‌fallen sharply since the U.S. seized a tanker off Venezuela's coast and imposed new sanctions on shipping firms and vessels doing business with it, with the prospect of further ‌seizures deterring shipments.\n\nChina, the world's no. 1 oil importer, is the biggest buyer of Venezuelan crude, though Venezuelan supply accounts for only around 4% of its total crude imports.\n\nVenezuelan oil arrivals to China are on track to rise this month and next, traders and analysts say, thanks to a spate of exports over the previous four months, deepening discounts on crude that can take up to 60 days to reach the independent refiners ⁠that are its main buyers.\n\n\"The surge in Venezuela ‌flow to China increased in anticipation of sanctions,\" said Mukesh Sahdev, founder & CEO of energy consultancy XAnalysts. He predicted that the impact of the tanker seizure, and any additional sanctions or seizures, would be seen in ‍February.\n\nDecember China arrivals of Merey crude, Venezuela's main export grade, are expected to exceed 600,000 barrels per day, according to analysts at tanker tracker Vortexa. Kpler puts December Merey arrivals at 664,000 bpd, subject to revision, which it said would be a record.\n\nMOUNTING VOLUMES OF OIL IN FLOATING STORAGE\n\nThe Venezuelan supply comes ​on top of ample deliveries from other sanctioned producers Russia and Iran, which have led to mounting volumes of oil in floating ‌storage in Asia.\n\nAsian floating oil storage hit 71 million barrels last week, rising from 53 million barrels at end-October and about 33 million barrels in early September, Kpler data showed, adding to pressure that had deepened discounts on Venezuelan crude.\n\nAt least one-third of the estimated 650,000 bpd of Merey discharged in November in China is still looking for end-buyers, said Vortexa analyst Emma Li.\n\nTwo trade sources said plentiful Russian and Iranian supply, along with barrels on the way to China from Venezuela, had limited market worries for now.\n\nAnother trading manager at a regular ⁠buyer said it would take time to gauge the impact of the seizure ​on supplies, but that his company had shifted to buying \"small amounts\" of Canadian TMX ​crude to hedge against geopolitical risk.",

    "fullText": "The Powerball grand prize has grown to more than $1 billion as nobody was able to win Saturday’s drawing.\n\nBut someone in South Carolina nearly walked away with the massive jackpot in a drawing earlier last week. A person who bought a Powerball ticket at a Quick Trip in the Midlands was just one number away from winning all the money, South Carolina Education Lottery officials said in a news release.\n\nFor coming so close to winning the Powerball grand prize, the person who purchased the ticket will be rewarded with a $100,000 payday, according to the release.\n\nNow the search is underway for the winner.\n\nThe $100,000 winning Powerball game was sold at the Quik Trip gas station/convenience store at 2840 Paxville Highway, according to the release. That’s in the Manning area of Clarendon County.\n\nThe winning numbers in the Dec. 10 Powerball drawing were 10, 16, 29, 33, 69 and Powerball: 22.\n\nThe odds of matching four white numbers and the red ball number is 1-in-913,129, officials said.\n\nThe winner has 180 days to claim the prize, according to lottery officials.\n\nThe winner will be allowed to retain some privacy, as South Carolina is one of 11 states — along with Arizona, Delaware, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, New Jersey, North Dakota, Ohio, Texas and Virginia — that allow lottery winners to remain anonymous.\n\n“Sign the back of your ticket and put it in a safe location until you’re ready to come forward to claim the prize,” lottery officials said.\n\nFor complete information on claiming prizes, go to sceducationlottery.com.\n\nWhen the ticket is claimed, the Quik Trip is expected to receive a commission for selling the winning game.\n\nIn addition to the $100,000 winning game, a ticket that won a $50,000 prize was sold at a Pitt Stop in Lexington prior to the Dec. 10 drawing, officials said. Another ticket sold before that drawing at a CVS in North Charleston also resulted in a $100,000 jackpot for the buyer, according to the release.\n\nBecause there was no grand prize winner Monday night, the jackpot for Saturday’s Powerball drawing has grown to $1.1 billion.\n\nAnyone looking to buy a ticket must make a purchase by 9:59 p.m. Monday for the 10:59 p.m. drawing. Tickets are $2, and could cost more with additional options.\n\nThe odds of winning Powerball’s grand prize are 1-in-293 million.",

    "fullText": "This article was originally published in Texas Tribune.\n\nThe Texas Education Agency is replacing the elected school boards of the Beaumont, Connally and Lake Worth school districts, Education Commissioner Mike Morath announced Thursday.\n\nState law allows Morath to either close a campus or appoint new leadership if at least one school in the district receives five consecutive failing grades in Texas’ academic accountability system. Each of the districts met that threshold.\n\nPending appeals, the commissioner plans to replace each district’s school board with a state-selected board of managers. Morath will also appoint a conservator with governing authority over current district and campus leaders during the transition, which typically takes several months to complete.\n\nGet stories like this delivered straight to your inbox. \nThe education agency will solicit applications from local community members interested in joining each district’s board of managers. Morath will also appoint superintendents to lead the districts.\n\nThe takeovers add to the growing list of districts subject to state interventions, which also includes two of Texas’ largest: Fort Worth and Houston. The Fort Worth school board has said it plans to appeal the commissioner’s decision, which was announced in October.\n\nThe education agency said in August that five school districts were at risk of intervention after enduring five consecutive years of unsatisfactory ratings. Since then, it has announced plans to take over four of them: Fort Worth, Lake Worth, Connally and Beaumont. Morath has not said whether he plans to intervene in the fifth district, Wichita Falls.\n\nEach of the schools that triggered takeovers in the Beaumont, Connally and Lake Worth districts educates a majority Black and Hispanic student population, and the overwhelming majority of their children come from low-income families.\n\nLake Worth’s Marilyn Miller Language Academy triggered the intervention in that district. In letters informing the districts about the takeovers, Morath noted that during the latest round of accountability ratings, all but one of Lake Worth’s six campuses earned failing grades. Meanwhile, five campuses have received unacceptable ratings for more than a year, while only 22% of students are meeting grade level across all subjects.\n\nLake Worth school district leaders were acutely aware of the challenges facing the school district leading up to the takeover, said Superintendent Mark Ramirez, who was hired this year. Ramirez said the district has focused on addressing the challenges facing each campus, which should serve as a foundation for the incoming board of managers to build upon.\n\n“Our preparation ensures zero instructional loss for our children,” Ramirez said.\n\nThe Connally district had two campuses that met the state’s takeover threshold: Connally Junior High and Connally Elementary. Since the 2022-23 school year, the number of campuses with academically unacceptable scores in the district has doubled, Morath noted. Only 24% of students in the district are meeting grade level. The junior high improved from an F to a D in the most recent ratings.\n\nIn a statement, the Connally district thanked the efforts of Superintendent Jill Bottelberghe in boosting academic performance in recent years but acknowledged the need for improvements.\n\n“We recognize that there is still work that needs to be done,” the statement said. “It is our hope that the appointed Board of Managers will work to not only improve our district’s academic performance, but also serve our community with the same passion and sincerity as our Board of Trustees has.”\n\nML King Middle School and Fehl-Price Elementary in the Beaumont district have also endured five consecutive years of failing grades. The commissioner cited data showing that the elementary school has never earned an acceptable rating, while the middle school has gone 11 years without one. The district has seven campuses with unacceptable ratings for more than a year and has not earned an overall acceptable rating since 2019. Thirty percent of students in the district are meeting grade level.\n\nThomas Sigee Sr., president of the Beaumont school board, said the district had sought to help its struggling campuses — including by partnering with charter schools — but ultimately could not lift them up to state standards. He questioned why the commissioner opted to take over the entire district instead of shutting down the schools.\n\n“We could have closed the schools for a year and facilitated those students to other campuses and go forward,” Sigee said. “I didn’t want the takeover because I knew it would spread chaos in our community.”\n\nIf the decision is finalized, it would mark the second time the state has placed the Beaumont district under its oversight. The education agency did so from 2014-2020 due to financial mismanagement.\n\nEach of the three districts will have opportunities later this month to attend an informal hearing with the commissioner to make their appeals. If Morath stands by his decision to intervene, they can then formally appeal to the State Office of Administrative Hearings.\n\nTakeovers were once rare in Texas, but they have grown more common in the last decade, thanks to the 2015 law that made it easier for the state to step in after five consecutive F grades. It also expanded the commissioner’s ability to initiate special investigations, which could lead to an intervention.\n\nThat A-F grading system is largely based on the State of Texas Assessments of Academic Readiness, a standardized exam that lawmakers voted this year to replace in 2027.\n\nBefore 2015, El Paso experienced the only academic takeover in Texas, due to a widespread cheating scandal. Since the law’s passage, the education agency has officially taken over three districts because of low academic performance: Marlin, Shepherd and Houston.\n\nMorath and state-appointed Superintendent Mike Miles believe the Houston ISD intervention was warranted, and they tout as evidence the improved test scores in the two years since it started. Students have improved in every tested subject. None of the district’s campuses received an F on the state’s accountability ratings in the 2024-25 school year, a drastic improvement from the 56 underperforming campuses in 2022-23.\n\nBut the intervention has also run into strong criticism. Teacher departures have skyrocketed. Thousands of students have unenrolled. And improved test scores have sparked concern that the district has accomplished its gains, in part, because of a hyperfocus on testing and moving students into less rigorous math and science classes.\n\nStephen Simpson, Jess Huff and Alex Nguyen contributed to this report.\n\nThis article first appeared on The Texas Tribune.",

    "fullText": "This duopoly saw strong demand for their products push revenue and margins higher in 2025.\n\nCustomers have started seeking substitutes, which could eat into pricing power in 2026.\n\nBoth stocks look richly valued for highly cyclical stocks.\n\n10 stocks we like better than Seagate Technology Plc ›\n\nThree years after the release of ChatGPT, generative AI remains the biggest trend in the stock market. It has created many big winners, as big tech companies are spending as much as possible building new data centers and outfitting them with equipment. Just about every industry has felt the impact of the trend, and it's even had a meaningful impact on U.S. GDP.\n\nBut the biggest winners are still firmly in the technology industry. While many investors think of software giants and chipmakers when considering the leading AI stocks, 2025 has been a year of increased demand for memory and storage. As developers expand the input for their large language models, demand for data storage and throughput has led to stellar financial results for many memory chip and hard drive makers.\n\nSeagate Technology (NASDAQ: STX), for example, has climbed 257% (at the time of this writing) on the back of strong demand for its high-capacity hard drives and promises of its next-generation technology. Likewise, Western Digital (NASDAQ: WDC) has climbed even faster, up 316% so far this year. But after a stellar run in 2025, 2026 could result in a bust in the stocks.\n\nAs companies like OpenAI and Anthropic build new large language models trained on billions of pieces of information, they require a storage solution to house all that data near their high-powered GPUs. Importantly, most of that data doesn't need to be instantly accessible for processing, and servers can use what's called \"nearline\" storage to access it. Nearline storage might take a few seconds to read, and that trade-off is usually worth it because it's relatively cheap.\n\nThe most common form of nearline storage are hard disk drives (HDDs). Seagate and Western Digital account for the vast majority of HDD sales, and both saw their revenue and earnings soar in 2025 amid growing demand for nearline storage. In fact, demand has climbed faster than supply, resulting in strong margin expansion for both, as they're able to raise prices on the big tech companies buying their products.\n\nWestern Digital CEO Irving Tan expects the market to remain supply constrained through mid-2027. Seagate CEO Dave Mosley said its capacity is already largely committed to contracts through 2026. Indeed, both companies should be able to continue growing revenue and earnings at a rapid pace next year.",

    "fullText": "BRUSSELS/LONDON/STOCKHOLM, Dec 15 (Reuters) - The European Commission is expected on Tuesday to reverse the EU's effective ban on sales of new combustion-engine cars from 2035, bowing to intense pressure from Germany, Italy and European automakers struggling against Chinese and U.S. rivals.\n\nThe move, the details of which are ​still being hashed out by EU officials ahead of its unveiling, could see the effective ban pushed back by five years or softened indefinitely, official ‌and industry sources said.\n\nThe likely revision to the 2023 law requiring all new cars and vans sold in the 27-nation bloc from 2035 to be CO2 emission-free would be the European Union's most significant climb-down from its ‌green policies of the past five years.\n\n\"The European Commission will be putting forward a clear proposal to abolish the ban on combustion engines,\" Manfred Weber, head of the European Parliament's largest group, the European People's Party, said on Friday. \"It was a serious industrial policy mistake.\"\n\nReneging on the ban has divided the sector. Traditional automakers like Volkswagen and Fiat-owner Stellantis have pushed hard for targets to be eased amid fierce competition from lower-cost Chinese rivals. The EV sector, however, sees it as yielding more ground to China in the electrification ⁠shift.\n\n\"The technology is ready, charging infrastructure is ready, and consumers ‌are ready,\" said EV maker Polestar's CEO Michael Lohscheller. \"So what are we waiting for?\"\n\nCOMBUSTION ENGINES AROUND FOR 'REST OF CENTURY'\n\nThe 2023 law was designed to accelerate a transition from combustion engines to batteries or fuel cells and fine automakers who failed to meet the targets.\n\nMeeting the ‍targets means selling more electric vehicles, where European carmakers lag Tesla and Chinese producers like BYD and Geely.\n\nEurope's carmakers are making EVs, but say demand has lagged expectations as consumers are reluctant to buy more expensive EVs and charging infrastructure is insufficient. EU tariffs on Chinese-built EVs have only slightly eased the pressure.\n\n\"It's not a sustainable reality today in Europe,\" Ford CEO Jim Farley ​told reporters in France last week, announcing a partnership with Renault to help cut EV costs. Industry needs were \"not well balanced\" with EU CO2 targets, he said.\n\nThe ‌EU granted the sector \"breathing space\" in March, allowing automakers to comply with 2025 targets over three years.\n\nBut automakers want to continue selling combustion-engine models alongside plug-in hybrids, range extender EVs with 'CO2-neutral' fuels - including biofuels made from agricultural residues and waste such as used cooking oil.",

However, those pains are tolerable as this team has dropped 30+ points in back-to-back games.\n\nWith the game officially wrapped up, let's take a look at the winners and losers from today's performance.\n\nNine is heating up. J.J. McCarthy has put together two nice outings and looks to be figuring some things out. In this one, he went 15/24 for 250 yards and a 2/1 TD/INT ratio. The decision-making has improved dramatically since coming back from his concussion, and when the tempo and accuracy start coming together, McCarthy just might figure things out.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings came into tonight's game ranked 22nd in the NFL in rushing yards per game. In the first half, the Vikings allowed just 44 yards. However, in the second half, the floodgates opened, as this team finished with 138 rush yards. Javonte Williams ran for 91 yards and a touchdown, averaging 6.1 yards per carry. There are certainly some things to clean up, and the rush defense needs to be a priority to sharpen up.\n\nJalen Nailor had his first career two-touchdown game, as he finished with just three receptions for 47 yards, but those two touchdowns were huge for this offense. Nailor appears to have the trust of McCarthy in the redzone, which, with the struggling connection with Justin Jefferson, McCarthy needs to have someone outside he can depend on. Speaking of which...\n\nYes, we have a neutral selection, but it needs to be talked about. The statistical performance was not good, as Justin Jefferson finished with just two receptions again for 22 yards. However, it is the eight targets that almost makes him a winner in my eyes. Jefferson had a touchdown early called back by a penalty, and another in the second half that went through his hands. The connection has struggled, yes, but this should be viewed as a positive stepping stone as we head toward the end of the season.\n\nAs we discussed at the top, the Minnesota Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention before the team took the field, as the franchise needed the Cleveland Browns to beat the Chicago Bears. It was a rough start to the year, and it is tough to find positives in this season now that it is basically over. But these last two games should instill some optimism about this franchise and whether they can keep this going.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Vikings Wire: Winners and Losers from Vikings Week 15 win over the Cowboys",

    "description": "Michael King wants Boston, but contract terms could decide everything.",
    "fullText": "On Sunday, MassLive’s Chris Cotillo shared a note on free agent starting pitcher Michael King, who has been linked to the Red Sox at various times throughout this offseason:\n\n“The Red Sox are among a number of teams still involved in talks with righty Michael King, a source confirmed Sunday, though there is no set timeframe for King’s decision. King, who attended Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island and pitched at Boston College, has a crowded market and is sifting through possibilities. According to one source, King would ‘love to be in Boston’ but as always, it’s a matter of terms and dollars lining up.”\n\nDespite missing time due to injury in 2025, King was still effective when he took the mound. Across 73 innings, he finished with a 5-3 record, a 3.44 ERA, 76 strikeouts, and a 1.20 WHIP. If he’s able to return at full strength, he profiles as a legitimate No. 2 starter in a big-league rotation - immediately making the acquisitions of Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo so much more intriguing ahead of next season.\n\nAs Cotillo noted, though, the real hurdle comes down to contract structure and financial commitment.\n\nBoston has several paths it could take in negotiations, but the option King is likely pushing for is a long-term deal. That’s where friction arises, as the organization has been open about its reluctance to hand out extended contracts to pitchers entering their 30s - even when one is clearly motivated to stay in Boston.\n\nBut with Boston reportedly unwilling to spend into the CBT this offseason, any consternation from the Red Sox on the contract front should come as no surprise.\n\nAt some point, the Red Sox may need to recognize how rare this opportunity is.\n\nA high-end starter who wants to be here doesn’t come around often. Meeting King’s demands would allow the front office to shift its full attention toward upgrading the offense, rather than continuing to circle back to the same unresolved pitching question.\n\nAnd while Boston has done plenty to bolster their staff in the last few weeks, King would truly be capper on reshaping a staff in desperate need of depth after running out of steam in the Wild Card Round against the Yankees in October.\n\nRed Sox 3 Most Untradeable Players This Offseason\n\nAnother One Off The Board For Boston As Jorge Polanco Signs With Mets\n\nWhile Marcelo Mayer Isn't Untouchable, Red Sox Reluctant To Include Him In Trade Talks\n\nRemember to join our RED SOX on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "description": "Which bets do you like the most?",
    "fullText": "Week 15 was a good one for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nNot only did they snap their three-game losing streak by dominating the Las Vegas Raiders in a shutout win.\n\nThey also got some help in the form of the Dallas Cowboys, who were 5.5-point betting favorites at home, losing to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday night.\n\nThe Eagles’ magic number to win their division is now down to one.\n\nThis means the Birds can officially clinch the NFC East in Week 16 by beating the Washington Commanders in Maryland on Saturday evening.\n\nIf the Eagles lose that game, they can still clinch the NFC East on Sunday if the Cowboys lose at home to the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nIf neither result works in the Eagles’ favor, they’ll have to try again in Week 17.\n\nThe only way Dallas can win the division at this point is if the Eagles lose their final three games AND the Cowboys win their final three games.\n\nWeek 16 at Washington Commanders\nWeek 17 at Buffalo Bills\nWeek 18 vs. Washington Commanders\n\nWeek 16 vs. Los Angeles Chargers\nWeek 17 at Washington Commanders\nWeek 18 at New York Giants\n\nThe Eagles are on the precipice of becoming the first team to repeat as NFC East champions since they last did it back in 2004.\n\nElsewhere in the NFC playoff picture, the Eagles got help with both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers losing in Week 15. Those results work towards Philly not falling to the No. 4 seed, which is important since that team is likely going to have to host the second place finisher in the NFC West in the Wild Card round. Not an ideal first round matchup.\n\nThe Eagles are currently on track to be the No. 3 seed. If they end up in that position, they’ll host the No. 6 seed. The San Francisco 49ers reside in that position at this moment.\n\nIt’s possible the Eagles can climb up to the No. 2 seed, which is what they had last year. But they’d likely need to win out and also get some help with the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers dropping games. Speaking of the Packers, their defense took a major hit on Sunday with Micah Parsons feared to have suffered an ACL injury.\n\nThe Eagles are mathematically alive for the No. 1 seed but just barely. The Los Angeles Rams and the Seattle Seahawks are the strongest contenders for that spot. There’s a huge game between those two teams on Thursday Night Football to kick off Week 16.\n\nHere’s the entire updated NFC playoff picture after Week 15 (note that Monday night’s game is between two AFC teams).\n\n1) Los Angeles Rams: 11-3*\n2) Chicago Bears: 10-4\n3) Philadelphia Eagles: 9-5\n4) Tampa Bay Buccaneers: 7-7\n\n*officially clinched playoff berth\n\n5) Seattle Seahawks: 11-3\n6) San Francisco 49ers: 10-4\n7) Green Bay Packers: 9-4-1\n\n8) Detroit Lions: 8-6\n9) Carolina Panthers: 7-7\n\n11) Minnesota Vikings: 6-8\n12) Atlanta Falcons: 5-9\n13) New Orleans Saints: 4-10\n14) Washington Commanders: 4-10\n15) Arizona Cardinals: 3-11\n16) New York Giants: 2-12",

    "description": "Triumphing in the NFL playoffs tends to require a degree of callousing. So while the Patriots were licking their wounds after their first loss in nearly three months, they weren't exactly crying about them, either.",
    "fullText": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — In the below-freezing tunnel of Gillette Stadium, Mike Vrabel held a stat sheet in his left hand and kept his right hand free for greetings.\n\nVrabel extended a fist bump to some of his players and a reassuring chest pat to others. He was not festive but he also was not forlorn. This was not the head-hanging or tunnel walk of silence in which losing coaches so often engage.\n\nIn fact, when tight end Hunter Henry looked down and shook his head after their encounter, Vrabel seemed intent on reminding the veteran: A 35-31 loss to the reigning league MVP and five-years-running division champions is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n“You know what I mean? This is the National Football League,” Vrabel shouted as Henry disappeared into the locker room.\n\nMike Vrabel reassures his players as they head back to locker room after 35-31 loss to Bills snaps Patriots 10-game win streak: pic.twitter.com/9KBnUR8yYV\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) December 14, 2025\n\nBefore long, receiver Stefon Diggs rounded out the group of players to trickle off the field and Vrabel, too, disappeared into the locker room to address his squad after their first loss since Sept. 21.\n\nThe manner of losing warranted some disappointment, after the Patriots blew a 21-point lead and 17-point halftime lead to the Buffalo Bills and snapped their 10-game winning streak in a stadium where both locker rooms spoke candidly about the seeming inevitably of Josh Allen.\n\nBut there was also reason for the Patriots to appreciate, if not celebrate, the value of their first final-score adversity in months. At 11-3 and atop the AFC East, albeit now just by one game, New England is well on track to host at least one playoff game for the first time since Vrabel’s Titans upset them in a wild-card game six years ago.\n\n[Get more Patriots news: New England team feed]\n\nTriumphing in January if not also February tends to require a degree of callousing. Sunday’s game, in which the Patriots had a host of individual accolades but not the final result they coveted, provided some. No, the division-champion hats and shirts did not leave their boxes Sunday. But the Patriots may have received a more substantive gift.\n\n“It’s good for us,” said Diggs, who’s played in the NFC championship and AFC championship games with the Minnesota Vikings and Bills, respectively. “When you’re playing a team like that, they play from behind. They’re used to playing from behind, fighting back and clawing. … It’s been a while since we lost [and] we probably needed it.\n\n“It’s like a daily dose of your humble pie.”\n\nAre there lessons Patriots can only learn from losses?\n\n“100%,” Stefon Diggs said after loss to Bills. “It’s like a daily dose of your humble pie.” pic.twitter.com/r5y3R9q5l8\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) December 14, 2025\n\nCornerback Carlton Davis, who won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tom Brady, echoed the sentiment.\n\n“We don't want to go into the playoffs not having been scathed,” Davis told Yahoo Sports. “The Patriots organization hasn't been in this position in quite a minute. So it’s good to get a little taste of that playoff atmosphere.\n\n“That’s a playoff team. They go to the big dance every year. So yeah, that was a great warmup for us.”\n\nBeneath a light but steady dusting of snow, the Patriots warmed up more quickly than the Bills.\n\nQuarterback Drake Maye’s MVP case was up for trial amid a relatively soft schedule of opponents. He’d already outlasted the Bills in Buffalo and the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay. Could he also finish off the Bills at home?\n\nFinding Kayshon Boutte 30 yards down the right sideline on third-and-7 aroused the home crowd’s first outburst of “M-V-P” chants. An 8-yard touchdown on a designed run around the left end cued up another chorus.\n\nBefore the first quarter was over, Maye would also scramble up the middle of the field 7 yards for a second rushing score to double the two rushing touchdowns he’d scored in 13 prior games this season. At that point, an uninformed bystander may have confused which quarterback was the dual-threat, reigning MVP.\n\n“Just seeing the defense and trying to use my legs when I can, trying to add an extra element in the red zone to gain an extra hat,” Maye said. “And from there, try to make a play and try to get in the end zone.”\n\nMaye’s success required the Bills defense to respect his legs. That threat aided explosive rookie TreVeyon Henderson in finding creases up the middle to spring a third New England rushing touchdown, Henderson’s second-level dominance carrying him the 52 yards home.\n\nThe Patriots, up 21-0 with 5:53 to play in the first half, held a 91.1% chance of winning, per Next Gen Stats win probability data.\n\nBut that algorithm didn’t account for Josh Allen being Josh Allen … which translated statistically into rebounding from three straight punts to score five straight touchdowns.\n\nAs the third quarter waned and the fourth quarter ratcheted up Buffalo’s intensity, the Bills hit their stride.\n\nCornerback Tre’Davious White intercepted Maye with 1:39 to play in the third quarter, thwarting a chance for the Patriots to respond after the Bills had narrowed New England’s lead to three. White’s interception still set the  Bills up with a daunting 91-yard field. But Buffalo didn’t blink.\n\nAllen converted a keeper on third-and-1 and, when he failed to move the chains on a third-and-2 pass, Bills coach Sean McDermott kept his offense on the field. Facing fourth-and-3 from the 45, again everyone in the stadium was reminded that Allen is inevitable.\n\nAnd thus a 37-yard pass from Allen arrived in the arms of receiver Khalil Shakir, even as Shakir needed to stretch his arms around cornerback Marcus Jones in the process.\n\nFour plays later, on third-and-14, Allen fired a laser to tight end Dawson Knox for Knox’s second touchdown of the afternoon — and the Bills’ first lead of the game.\n\n“I saw Josh rolling out, we work the scramble drill a lot in practice and just threw a frozen rope right in my chest,” Knox said. “I had no choice but to catch that one. Just crazy scramble drill. It was just a five verticals concept. I was supposed to kind of stay on my side of the field.\n\n“Unbelievable throw by Josh Allen, man.”\n\nAnother Henderson unleashing in the form of a 65-yard touchdown (and stellar downfield blocking from Maye) wouldn’t be enough to derail the Bills’ momentum. With a 24-7 second-half advantage and heavy pressure on Maye disrupting the Patriots’ passing game, the Bills gave the Patriots a taste of the challenges that await New England in January.\n\n“That was a playoff game,” Davis said. “When you get down to the end of the season and you start talking about seeding, you start talking about division, that’s a playoff game.\n\n“Maybe we needed this loss to help us correct a couple of things. And so [we know] we’re not invincible, but still a great team.”\n\nThe Patriots want to be clear: Winning was the goal and preference Sunday.\n\n“Of course we’re not happy with that,” Henderson said after a career-high 161 scrimmage yards and two scores. “Of course we wanted to come out with the win.”\n\nBut losing a game in which they outgained the Bills 285 yards to 76 in the first half, also putting the Bills in their largest halftime hole (17 points) of the season?\n\nIf that doesn’t teach New England’s locker room the necessity of playing 60 minutes, the Patriots aren’t sure what will. Linebacker Jack Gibbens was not alone in believing that “the sense of urgency to get things fixed after a loss definitely picks up.” The blueprint that the Bills parlayed — pressure Maye into thinking about the pass rush at the expense of downfield routes, wear down a depleted New England defensive cast with extended drives — will come back to haunt the Patriots if they don’t respond accordingly.\n\nSure, Maye excites the Patriots in the present and the future, his 109.1 passer rating trailing only the Los Angeles’ Rams Matthew Stafford and Detroit Lions’ Jared Goff while his 70.9% completion percentage leads the league.\n\nMaye’s 27 offensive touchdowns are tied for seventh-most in the NFL. His accuracy, play extension and smarts to change plays at the line of scrimmage impress teammates and opponents alike. He has received comparisons to Allen.\n\nBut he’s not there yet. Because there’s a belief that teams develop when a quarterback has already proven they can win and rebound repeatedly in improbable circumstances. The MVPs of recent history have done that. There were days when one just could not explain Allen or Patrick Mahomes or Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers.\n\nMaye, meanwhile, has helped the Patriots start fast and survive attempts to thwart wins. He will continue to build his arsenal of late-game comebacks and fourth-quarter elevations as Allen has in a career that’s already earned him an MVP, albeit not yet the Super Bowl title he eyes.\n\nVrabel will tell Maye, as he tells all his players, that losses like Sunday’s are part of that climb. They’re part of the pursuit of greatness and they’re part of the maturation process that will sharpen a team when games don’t just resemble playoff environments but also carry the elimination actualities. Next week’s visit to the Baltimore Ravens will present yet another chance.\n\nThat sense of resolve settled over the Patriots as the rawness of their loss softened slightly.\n\nVrabel’s call to Henry that “this is the National Football League” didn’t compel the tight end to turn back on his dejected entrance into the locker room. But 16 minutes later, as Hunter addressed reporters from his locker, he had absorbed — consciously or subconsciously — the message.\n\n“This definitely can be a kind of kick in the butt,” Henry said. “We’ve had things go our way and everything go our way the last 10 weeks, so this is definitely a reality check.\n\n“That’s a good football team. We went toe to toe with them in every aspect. But we have to give them credit.\n\n“We’ve got to get a lot better from this — fast.”",

    "description": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea from Steve Kerr about gun control.",
    "fullText": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea for gun control from Steve Kerr.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors coach spoke for about three minutes unprompted on Sunday night before their 136-131 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers and again called for gun reform in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University.\n\n“With what happened last night at Brown, it’s just a reminder to me that these shootings continue to happen, and there is something we can do about them. The loss that all of the people involved [Saturday] night, the loss that they’re feeling, it’s exactly the same loss as all the Parkland families, and every other mass shooting.\n\n“Nobody asked me about it today. I didn’t expect anybody to ask me. I doubt we’re gonna do a moment of silence out there because it’s human nature just to not want to deal with this stuff. And it’s human nature just to think, ‘This is so horrible. Let’s not even think about it.’ But we have to think about it.”\n\nSpeaking pregame, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr addresses gun violence following this weekend’s shooting at Brown University.\n\n“We know there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. … I just want people thinking ‘What if it were my child?’”\n\nMore: pic.twitter.com/E2n9z62jYZ\n\n— Sam Gordon (@BySamGordon) December 15, 2025\n\nA shooting took place at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday afternoon that left two people dead and nine others injured, according to The New York Times. An investigation is still ongoing. Authorities released a man who they had detained on Sunday night, and are still searching for the alleged gunman.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, that was the 389th mass shootings in the United States so far this year. There have been others since.\n\nGun control is something that Kerr has been a strong advocate of for years. He’s spoken out about plenty of other mass shootings in the United States in the past, hosted a town hall about the issue, drawn support for groups founded by students who survived other mass shootings, and more. Kerr’s father, Malcolm, was shot and killed during a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984 when Steve was a student at Arizona.\n\n“The vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Kerr said. “They have every right to own a gun. But it’s on us to decide if we actually want to take action as a country, as citizens. We know, we know that there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. And I just want people out there — it doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican, or gun owner, non-gun owner — I just want people thinking, ‘What if it were my child? What if it were my brother or sister?’ Would you be willing to stand up to your representatives and say, ‘You know what? Enough. I’m not gonna vote for you unless you are going to stand up for gun violence prevention through common-sense laws that the vast majority of Americans agree on.'\n\n“Or are we just gonna continue to let the gun lobby run us over and not do anything to protect each other, to protect our children, to protect our future. We have to make that decision.”\n\nKerr wasn't alone in the sports world, either. USC women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb, who played at Brown, spoke out on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's the guns,\" she said after the Trojans' loss to No. 1 UConn. \"We're the only country that lives this way.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time that Kerr has addressed this issue, and mass shootings continue to occur in the United States. Based on recent history, it likely won't be the last time we hear from Kerr about gun control, either.\n\nWhile Kerr knows how easy it would be to just give up and ignore the problem, especially since it seems like nothing is getting better, he ended his plea on Sunday night with a simple solution.\n\n“Don’t just look the other way, even though that’s human nature and I understand it,” Kerr said. “Think about it. Think about, do you want something done? Do you want your child to go to school terrified every day? Or do you want to actually take action?\n\n“Because that’s what a democracy is about. Where we demand that our representatives protect us. And that option is there. So, we can either just do what we’re continuing to do and let these things happen or make some demands. And so, as you’re thinking about this today, think about, what if it were your own family member?”",

    "description": "New manager Skip Schumaker has been clear already that Carter has to show that he can hit left-handed pitchers on a regular basis.",
    "fullText": "Texas Rangers center fielder Evan Carter is one of those players that Rangers manager Skip Schumaker hopes can really make a difference in 2026.\n\nEven before the team reaches Spring Training down in Port Charlotte, Fla., Schumaker has some things that he wants to see from Carter. Carter, a left-handed batter for the Rangers, hasn't been known as someone who hits left-handed pitchers consistently.\n\nFor Schumaker, that's an issue that he wants to see improvement upon from Carter.\n\n\"I think he understands that and he’s out to prove that he can play against lefties,\" Schumaker said last week at the Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla., according to Texas Rangers on SI. \"But you have to give him a little bit of an opportunity to produce.\"\n\nLast season, Carter hit five home runs and had 25 RBIs while hitting .247. Carter also stole 14 bases, showing that he has a mix of power, speed, and agility that the Rangers just love.\n\nCarter, though, has been getting over a fractured wrist. Rangers general manager Ross Fenstermaker believes that Carter should be ready to rock when Spring Training comes around.\n\nIf Carter can put up some consistent numbers across the board next season, then the Rangers will welcome him as a big producer for the ballclub.\n\nThe SI article pointed out some striking statistics about Carter hitting left-handed pitchers versus right-handed pitchers. Take a look at his numbers against lefties: 23 at-bats with a slash line of .087/.250/.087 with just one RBI. What about righties? A completely different story. Five homers, 24 RBIs in 171 at-bats, and a slash line of .269/.349/.433.\n\nThat's one whale of a difference for Carter.\n\nSchumaker wants those numbers to come out in a more balanced way. Should Carter be able to bring up those numbers against lefties, then it's probably going to get him more at-bats from Schumaker. But if Carter struggles against them, then Schumaker will have to put into effect a platoon system.\n\nHe'd have to make sure whoever plays center field when Carter isn't in there can put up some quality ABs for the Rangers.\n\nIn 2026, Carter and the Rangers want to get back into the MLB postseason conversation. As has been mentioned at Rangers Roundtable, the Rangers have two big stumbling blocks facing them: the Seattle Mariners and Houston Astros.\n\nThose two teams have dominated the American League West Division for some time. Of course, when the Rangers won the World Series back in 2023, they had the upper hand over both teams.\n\nSchumaker has been brought into the dugout to bring a new mindset, a new attitude, a new way of playing on the field. It's going to be interesting to see how Carter plays into Schumaker's plans for next season.\n\nRemember to join our RANGERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStephen Curry is doing everything in his power to keep the Golden State Warriors’ heads above water.\n\nThe 11-time All-Star was out of the franchise’s lineup for several contests due to a concerning right quad contusion, but has returned in style.\n\nCurry netted 39 points in his first game back against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night, but the Dubs still fell short in the end.\n\nOn Sunday night, the four-time NBA champion erupted for 48 points vs. the Portland Trail Blazers, but once again, Golden State came out on the losing end.\n\nThat said, the Warriors’ shortcomings as a unit shouldn’t overshadow the fact that Curry recently made basketball history that's never been done by an NBA point guard.\n\n“Steph Curry has the most 45-point games by a point guard in NBA history,” Real Sports wrote on X/Twitter.\n\nEven if Golden State is unable to reach its full potential this season, fans should expect more 45+ point explosions from the best shooter of all time.\n\nCurry isn’t the type of player who can get neutralized regularly, considering he’s been tasked with assuming a bulk of the offensive responsibilities for the seven-time NBA champions.\n\nCurry is averaging 28.5 points per game on 47.3% field goal shooting and 39.1% three-point shooting with Golden State this year.

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim has faced plenty of heat for his utilisation of Manchester United wonderkid Kobbie Mainoo this season.\n\nNot too long ago, the Carrington graduate was starring for the Red Devils as they overcame Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Who can forget his injury-time winner against Olympique Lyonnais last season?\n\nFrom those heady heights, the Englishman has fallen on hard times under the head coach in this campaign. A total of zero starts in the Premier League has meant the 20-year-old is desperate to jump ship in January.\n\nHe had asked INEOS to leave in the summer as well, and he is likely to approach them once again in the coming days to find some sort of solution.\n\nIt is clear from Amorim’s comments that the England international is unlikely to see too many minutes unless there are injuries or the head coach shuffles his pack.\n\nA whole host of clubs are chasing the United No.37, and while Napoli remains his preferred destination, CaughtOffside have claimed that Chelsea are leading the race.\n\nThe Blues had signed fellow Carrington graduate Alejandro Garnacho in the summer and are now looking to add more young talents from the Red Devils.\n\nBayern Munich are also strong contenders. Thankfully for the 20-time English league champions, the Stockport-born ace remains committed to his boyhood club, and wants only a temporary exit to boost his England World Cup hopes.\n\nHe prefers a foreign club, and the co-owners are unlikely to sanction a deal to a domestic top-four unless it involves an offer too good to be refused.\n\n“Although at least 12 clubs are reportedly in the race, sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Chelsea and Bayern Munich are “leading the chase”.\n\n“It will be interesting to see if Chelsea can convince Manchester United to sell. They are looking to build a formidable team for the future, and the England International midfielder could be the final piece of the puzzle for them.\n\n“However, the player’s personal preference list still places Napoli as the frontrunner. Mainoo is prioritising where he can be a guaranteed starter as he plots his next move.”\n\nHopefully, it does not come to that and the talented star remains at Old Trafford for the foreseeable future.\n\nPossibly, AFCON departures could finally force Amorim to hand Kobbie Mainoo more gametime. And the midfielder must grab his chance with both hands when it arrives.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Ben McKevitt looks on the main stories from a highly-charged Wear-Tyne derby — what a day!",
    "fullText": "From the first minute, it was clear that the Lads wanted this more than the scared Geordies.\n\nThe match featured precious few chances for either side but Sunderland’s spirit, hunger, drive and pride was on full display. The midfield battle was won by Granit Xhaka, Noah Sadiki and Enzo Le Fée — latter of whom didn’t stop running for the duration of the game.\n\nThis gave us a wonderful base from which to impose ourselves and it’s fair to say that Newcastle simply couldn’t handle us. We all hoped for this from our players coming into this game, and they didn’t let us down — but frankly I expected more from that sorry lot up the road.\n\nThe first half saw a thundering tackle from Nordi Mukiele, crashing into the ribs of Dan Burn near the touchline, and whilst Mukiele did receive a yellow for the collision, it was absolutely worth it to see the world’s longest man limp off the pitch and apparently straight to the nearest doctor.\n\nIt exemplified the battling spirit we showed across the pitch and despite the referee’s best efforts, we outfought the poor black and white boys.\n\nIt was especially fitting to see Xhaka briefly come off the pitch towards the end of the game with a bloody warrior’s wound after a huge melee broke out between the two teams leading to four yellows. Our captain fully understood the task yesterday and was an excellent leader from the centre.\n\nReinildo was also notably fired up as expected, leaving very little in the way of caution for those he clattered into throughout the game. We even got a crunching Trai Hume leveller near the end which tied a nice bow on what was a wonderfully full-blooded performance from those in red and white.\n\nThis feels like a “full circle” moment for Ballard.\n\nHe was our best player against Newcastle when we played them in the ill-fated FA Cup contest almost two years ago, but succumbed to a couple of horrible moments in the form of a conceded penalty and an unfortunate own goal. It seemed unfair at the time, but summed up our day, really.\n\nHowever, enter 2025 Ballard: a man reborn, a defensive colossus and a Sunderland legend in the making.\n\nDuring a year in which he’s given us so many great moments and performances, I’m sure that this one will feel as good as any for Ballard, as he easily managed to swat away Newcastle’s feeble attempts on our goal, claiming a clean sheet and what I saw as a “man of the match” performance along the way.\n\nHe epitomises what the club is about days and Florent Ghisolfi’s comments highlight it — “We couldn’t just buy a Ballard from somewhere in Europe”. He’s battled through injury and heartbreak to become our most combative, intimidating defender (and that’s saying something in this Sunderland squad!).\n\nI’m so glad we have him and long may his reign at the back last. There’s only room for one “BDB” in the North East.\n\nI’m almost grudgingly including the referee’s performance here, but it truly does deserve some recognition for all the wrong reasons. Somehow, the refereeing performances just seem to get worse and worse in this league — and this display could be the most spineless of the season.\n\nFrom the start of the game, he was spectacularly inconsistent.\n\nYellows were brandished sparingly — perhaps in an attempt to let the derby flow in the early stages — but as the game developed, this didn’t seem to let up. Ballard was effectively manhandled by two Newcastle players any time he crossed the line into their box without any repercussions, and whilst penalties on each occasion would certainly have been soft, the lack of action meant that Newcastle players were welcome to essentially double team Ballard out of position and win the header themselves.\n\nThe most galling of all aspects was, however, the lack of yellows for intentional fouls which were often used as a way to break up our counter attacks.\n\nMalick Thiaw committed numerous cynical and intentional fouls, often on Brian Brobbey (who himself should’ve seen red save for the referee’s incompetence) without any repercussions. The overall effect of this saw the Lads drop deeper and deeper into our own half to defend, as we literally couldn’t launch a counter attack without being fouled without punishment.\n\nAwful, but even he couldn’t stop our victory march yesterday.\n\nA word of admiration for what must be one of the best strikers and signings in the Premier League this season. It’s clear to see why the Newcastle supporters have made such a big deal of the arrival of the German — and big Nick delivered in the biggest game of all.\n\nHe dazzled us with a beauty of a glancing header which flew past the goalkeeper, rattled the crossbar and ended up in the back of the net, putting the biggest team in the North East 1-0 up. The stadium erupted thanks to his decisive action, and I couldn’t have been more impressed with the finish.\n\nI look forward to seeing much of him this season, if that’s what he’s capable of in the big moments. Three cheers for Saint Nick during this festive season!\n\nThe pride, the emotion and the feeling in the stadium was electric and the noise never faltered. Once upon a time, the “Stadium of Light effect” seemed like a hindrance to the players who took to the pitch in our colours, but now it’s a fortress and the ultimate source of pride.\n\nThe displays were observed immaculately ahead of kick-off and the tifo may just be the best we’ve had so far — what a beauty! It was a brilliant omen and fairly indicative of how the game played out in reality.\n\nThis is what it’s all about, isn’t it?\n\nWe’re back in the big time, but we’re not just back — we’re thriving and we’re shaking this league up, driving the team on with our passion and pride and beating the Mags along the way.\n\nA tribute to Gary Rowell was conducted after the devastating news of his passing on Saturday. He’s remembered so fondly for his contributions in derbies and I’m so glad the Lads could do him proud and get the win.\n\nHe’d have loved that performance. Rest in Peace, Gary!\n\nFinally, a word on those that came down to gift us three points yesterday.\n\nTheir fans were awfully quiet throughout; the pretend hard men in the middle delivered absolutely nothing, and they were very generous in delivering the three points so gently to us on a platter.\n\nI’d like to thank the richest club in the world for their brilliant Christmas gift this year…cheers!",

But they would like to be in a better position right now, even still.\n\nLiam Rosenior in a Strasbourg press conference.\n\nAfter the game, Rosenior has clearly been disappointed with set pieces from his side this season and seems to suggest that they players are not doing what he is telling them to do and also, they are missing Andrey Santos, who was of course at Strasbourg last season but is now back at Chelsea.\n\n“He [Andrey Santos] is missed, he was huge on set pieces. Today, there are unacceptable things on corners, free kicks. My players must do what I ask. Otherwise, we’ll find others.”\n\nChelsea are apparently the frontrunners to sign one player who has played just 183 minutes so far this season, according to the latest transfer report out over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Enzo Maresca has been warned to keep his mouth shut by one BBC pundit this week following comments he made after the Everton game on Saturday.",

    "fullText": "Whilst the players deserve all the praise that comes their way, I think Le Bris must be given immense credit.\n\nHis selection was spot on; four at the back was the correct call and Brian Brobbey did a stellar job up top holding up the ball. Leaving out Trai Hume was a bold call, but the right one.\n\nOur preparation was on point and the players understood and embraced the occasion.\n\nThis team just gets it. From the first whistle, we got into them and didn’t give them any time to think.\n\nThey weren’t overawed and were disciplined whilst getting stuck in. I can’t remember a better quality Sunderlwnd side than this in my lifetime.\n\nHard to find a negative to be honest, but I guess losing some of these players for AFCON — Noah Sadiki, Reinildo, Bertrand Traoré et al were superb and will be missed.\n\nIt would’ve been nice for a Sunderland player to score, but now I’m being picky!\n\nColossus. When he got home, I think he would’ve found Nick Woltemade in his pocket.\n\nThe lad was immense — which is just as well as I thought Omar Alderete started quite slowly and looked a bit off it early doors, but he gave the Newcastle forwards zero chances and thwarted every attack that came his way.\n\nI think everyone will agree that he ran the show for us in the middle of the park.\n\nHe was a shield for our back four and was often a route to goal for us at the other end.\n\nHe just allows our other midfielders to take up pockets of space to either block attacks or fill spaces to create a route forward.\n\nThe lad didn’t score but he was a brute up top, and Dan Burn and Malick Thiaw struggled with his presence.\n\nSome of his hold up play was superb and if the referee was at all competent, he’d have booked Thiaw well before he finally did.\n\nAn awful display from that clown.\n\nThiaw committed five fouls before he finally got booked for dissent. The booking of Nordi Mukiele was a joke as both he and Burn led with their knees, but as Burn decided to stay down crying, he deemed the tackle too strong.\n\nFinally, he failed to book Fabian Schär for a clear deliberate trip on Brobbey — yet happily whipped a card out for Reinildo’s challenge on Anthony Gordon…where no contact was made!\n\nThe crowd did their part by “greeting” the Mags at the stadium and for their warm up.\n\nThe crowd was superb throughout and I hardly heard their fans chanting despite sitting in the North East corner. Everyone sang loud and proud for the Lads — and for Gary Rowell.\n\nHe put a shift in, acting as a battering ram and getting nothing off the referee all game.\n\nSolid as a rock and my man of the match.\n\nThe ref was my only downer on a glorious afternoon.\n\nHe gave us very little and nearly lost the game at the end. He seemed to have a vendetta against Brobbey and Sunderland in general, but he couldn’t spoil our day, our win, our pride and our joy.\n\nFor the unbelievers amongst us, pre-match nerves were based around the question of whether this group of players understood what this fixture meant.\n\nNeedless to say, there was no need to worry.\n\nNobody shirked a difficult challenge and the team’s desire to win second balls shone through. Yes, the game lacked quality but we definitely didn’t lack heart.\n\nI was slightly surprised to see Sky Sports award Dan Ballard with “Man of the Match”.\n\nHe was a colussus in the middle but for me, Nordi Mukiele deserves the most plaudits. I always assumed that the players’ shorts didn’t feature pockets but if you search deep down inside Nordi’s, you’ll find Anthony Gordon.\n\nHe didn’t get a sniff all game and finishing with a clean sheet and an assist just shows how brilliant his performance was.\n\nOne of the things that was worse than Michael Beale’s masterminding of the FA Cup tie was the aftermath — particularly the photo taken with Newcastle celebrating with their fans in our own stadium.\n\nHowever, I’d take that every day for the revenge we got yesterday.\n\nWhen you take part in stupid acts like that, people don’t forget, and the photo of this team celebrating with the South Stand is something that we’ll all remember.\n\nLike many others have said, the referee was baffling, letting several incidents slide which should’ve been pulled up — and Brian Brobbey had every right to feel aggrieved at what was a bizarre refereeing performance.\n\nDuring the early games, it felt like there was a well-received increase in quality from the officials when compared to what we endured in the Championship but with every passing week, the lines are blurring.\n\nThankfully, though, it had no impact on the performance and we walked away with all three points.\n\nAs the season has progressed, each home game has had the feel of “the biggest match of the season” for one reason or another, but this topped the lot.\n\nOur fans were magnificent throughout in a boiling atmosphere and there was the tribute for Gary Rowell right before kick-off.  It was a typical derby game — plenty of commitment all round and little goal action.\n\nFor overall endeavour and passage of play over the ninety minutes, we deserved to win it without offering a lot of goal threat, but neither did they.\n\nI saw a Middlesborough player put the winner away for us with ruthless efficiency back in February, but this one was even better.\n\nWoltemade was absolutely mercurial with his finish, launching his header in off the underside of the bar and thats exactly why Newcastle paid £65 million for him: to score spectacular goals like that and get the fans on their feet.  An unfortunate moment for him, but in a game that for all the effort shown featured few clear cut openings, all it would take was a mistake like that.\n\nFortunately, we were the benefactors and our run against Newcastle goes on. It’s almost like we haven’t been away!\n\nI try to look at referees objectively as I think they have a difficult job and the frustrations that I see regularly vented by supporters could be tinged with a liberal dose of bias, but dear Lord…this one?\n\nBrian Brobbey was flattened every time the ball was cleared up to him, but without any free kick coming our way.  Then on at least two occasions, when Sunderland were breaking from two positions, our players were fouled and although he did give the free kick our way, there was no yellow card for what were clearly bookable offences.\n\nIf any Newcastle players went down, he stopped the game — but not for anyone in a red and white shirt. He managed to keep it under control when tensions nearly boiled over towards the end, but overall I think he was pretty poor.\n\nThis one was for Gary Rowell. He would’ve loved it.",

    "description": "Sunderland draw in a six-goal thriller at Ayresome Park!",
    "fullText": "Following the shock of relegation from the top flight for the first time in our history in 1958, Alan Brown had a big job on his hands to rebuild the club.\n\nNot only did the club’s reputation require a rebrand after allegations of illegal payments made to players resulted in the highest-ever fine imposed on any football club by the FA up to that point, but fresh blood was needed on the team.\n\nIn the first two years in Division Two, Sunderland finished 15th and 16th in the table, which, although disappointing, allowed the likes of Len Ashurst, Cecil Irwin, Jim McNab, Nicky Sharkey and Martin Harvey to all come through the ranks to establish themselves.\n\n1960-61 proved to be more successful, with Brown’s side finishing a more respectable 6th in the table, one point and one place in the table behind Middlesbrough. Now, this wouldn’t usually be significant, but in the game at Ayresome Park that season, the sides were separated by a single goal, which was scored by a striker by the name of Brian Clough.\n\nBrown went straight out and did all he could that summer to bring Clough to Roker, which included meeting the striker as he went on a cruise with his wife to secure the £48,000 deal to bring him up the A19. In his first season – the same season where Jimmy Montgomery made his Sunderland debut – Clough set a post-war record of scoring 34 goals.\n\nBut promotion still eluded Sunderland and Clough as they finished a point behind Leyton Orient and nine points above champions Liverpool. There was a fresh optimism that 1962-63 would be the year that Sunderland returned to the First Division, and by mid-December Brown’s side were well placed in a promotion spot behind Chelsea, who topped the table.\n\nOn this day in 1962, Sunderland travelled to Clough’s old stomping ground, Middlesbrough, who were struggling in mid-table without his goals. What looked like on paper a potential routine victory for Sunderland turned into anything but, as the Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail described:\n\nRarely in their long histories can either Middlesbrough or Sunderland have fought so hard for a point as they did in Saturday’s “derby”. This was probably the best “derby” yet, and it was played at a tremendous pace from start to finish.\n\nI didn’t add the quotation marks in that quote by the way…\n\n43,232 crammed into Ayresome Park and after around twenty minutes Sunderland took the lead through George Mulhall, with what was described as a “brilliant solo run down the left” and shooting from an “impossible” angle that “skidded into the net” – but the controversy began a few moments later.\n\nFirstly, Ian Gibson stepped on McNab’s chest and soon after, the ball was knocked long up to Clough, who looked 5-6 yards offside. Clough’s reaction told the same story as he stood still with the ball as everyone waited for the whistle; this stillness ended with the striker almost casually toe-poking the ball over the goalkeeper and into the net. To everyone’s surprise, the goal was given.\n\nTwo minutes later, George Herd put Sunderland three up, and the game looked out of sight. But the situation with McNab’s injury looked serious as the series of events was described in the Journal:\n\nMcNab’s injury was the focal point of a fantastic “derby game as it has ever been my good fortune to see. He was first hurt in a clash with Gibson in the 17th minute, but after treatment, resumed in time to see Sunderland take the lead three minutes later.\n\nWhile he was being placed on the stretcher, this was increased to two and before he could be carried to the tunnel, Sunderland were three up, though McNab knew nothing about these goals until afterwards.\n\nA minute later, Boro took advantage and pulled one back through Billy Horner and five minutes before half-time it was back to 2-3 and two minutes later it was 3-3, and it remained so until the break. It all pointed to Boro taking control and maximum points in the second half, but Sunderland heroically held on to claim the point and celebrated as if they had won.\n\nSunderland: Montgomery, Nelson, Ashurst, Harvey, Hurley, McNab, Davison, Herd, Clough, Fogarty, Mulhall\n\nMiddlesbrough: Emmerson, McNeil, Jones, Yeoman, Nurse, Horner, Kaye, Gibson, Peacock, Orritt, Hume",

    "fullText": "Manchester United welcome Bournemouth to Old Trafford on Monday night. They are aiming to build on their impressive victory at Molineux and continue their ascent up the Premier League table.\n\nRuben Amorim’s side appear to have turned a corner recently. They have lost just one of their last nine Premier League games. Furthermore, they have collected more points in this period than in their previous 17 matches combined. The Red Devils arrive in high spirits after thrashing Wolves 4-1 last weekend. However, they face a Bournemouth side currently enduring a slump.\n\nThe Cherries are winless in their last six league matches. This is their longest such streak since early 2024. Despite their recent struggles, Andoni Iraola’s men have a formidable recent record at the Theatre of Dreams. They have won their last two away games against United by a 3-0 scoreline on both occasions.\n\nVenue: Old Trafford, Manchester\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester United 4-1 Bournemouth, 31 July 2025, Premier League Summer Series\n\nRuben Amorim confirmed that defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain sidelined with injuries. Furthermore, striker Benjamin Šeško is a major doubt due to food poisoning and will be assessed late. With defensive options limited, the manager may be forced to shuffle his backline. However, Amad Diallo, Noussair Mazraoui, and Bryan Mbeumo are expected to be available before departing for the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nAndoni Iraola faces a midfield selection headache. Lewis Cook serves the second game of his three-match suspension for a red card against Sunderland. Additionally, Ryan Christie and Ben Doak remain sidelined. Defensively, Marcos Senesi is a doubt after suffering cramps against Chelsea. However, the defender is optimistic about featuring. Young defender Veljko Milosavljevic is out for a couple of months with a knee injury.\n\nUnited’s recent resurgence has seen them climb the table. However, defensive fragility remains an issue. They have kept just one clean sheet in 15 Premier League games this season. Under Amorim, the team has recorded a clean sheet ratio of just 14.3%. Conversely, their attack is firing. Bruno Fernandes has been involved in eight goals in his last eight games.\n\nThe Cherries have hit a wall offensively. They have failed to score in their last two Premier League games. In fact, they managed just 18 shots in those goalless draws. Historically, this fixture has been tricky for United recently. They are winless in their last four meetings with Bournemouth. If Bournemouth win, they would become the first side ever to win three consecutive top-flight away games against Manchester United while scoring three or more goals each time.\n\nManchester United predicted XI: Lammens; Mazraoui, Heaven, Shaw; Diallo, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot; Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha\n\nBournemouth predicted XI: Petrović; Smith, Diakité, Senesi, Truffert; Adams, Scott; Brooks, Tavernier, Semenyo; Evanilson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League. Coverage starts at 18:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Premier League Team of the Weekend: Ekitike, Rogers, Wilson\n\nSee more- Sunderland boss celebrates ‘special’ derby win over Newcastle\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "“Days like this are the sweetest reward of all for the turmoil we’ve had to endure over the past decade”.",
    "fullText": "A full-blooded performance to savour.\n\nAn atmosphere to revel in, and a result that’ll go a long way to showing that in the inter-city battle for North East supremacy between ourselves and Newcastle, Sunderland aren’t the plucky underdogs; the wide-eyed kid who finds himself playing with the big boys and is merely happy to participate rather than dwell on the outcome.\n\nLet this message be read and understood by all comers: we’re a serious football team.\n\nWe’re a serious football club, and as Nick Woltemade wrote his name into the history books with a looping header that sent the Stadium of Light into raptures (a deadly finish — just at the wrong end of the pitch from a black and white perspective) the energy that had crackled throughout this gritty Wear-Tyne derby finally erupted.\n\nThe lead was ours. We wouldn’t relinquish it and victory — greeted by the kind of roar that’s becoming commonplace at our home nowadays — was a moment that none of us will ever forget.\n\nWith Eddie Howe’s side appearing to be waylaid by stage fright, a lack of energy or simply a lack of belief in what they were attempting to do (What were they attempting to do? Answers on a postcard, please), this was a game decided by the kind of organic qualities to which the statisticians seem averse but Sunderland fans love to see.\n\nHeart, resilience, desire, work rate…you name it, and we displayed it in spades on Sunday.\n\nForget XG ratings and all of that mathematical guff — this was a derby as it used to be, won by the side who wanted it more, the side who displayed greater conviction in their play and who were willing to go the extra mile in pursuit of victory.\n\nRemember the inscription on the iconic Lambton Worm tifo — “The man who wins is the man who thinks he can”? Rarely — if ever — has there been a more fitting precursor to a Sunderland derby performance.\n\nSadness tinged this game as the spirit of the dearly departed Gary Rowell hung heavy in the crisp afternoon air, and I hope it won’t sound presumptuous to state that he would’ve doubtless loved what he saw from his beloved red and whites against their Saudi-backed neighbours.\n\nNews of his passing broke on Saturday evening; moving tributes were paid before kick off and there’s little doubt in my mind that the Lads channeled it into their performance — one filled with all of the traits we’ve come to expect from this side.\n\nCan Sunderland play better, more aesthetically pleasing and more entertaining football than we did on Sunday? Yes.\n\nWe’ve done so already this season, but derbies are often decided by key moments and when Woltemade — pocketed by the colossal Dan Ballard to add to his own goal strife — connected with Nordi Mukiele’s whipped cross, it proved the difference.\n\nFundamentally, exactly how you win in these kinds of affairs doesn’t matter.\n\nVictory or defeat is all that’s remembered, but to that memorable night in the St James’ Park deluge to Jermain Defoe’s winner in 2015, another milestone can be added and I don’t think any fair-minded supporter could rightly claim this was a fluke victory.\n\nAs we knew they’d need to do if we wanted to see off the visitors, all of our key men rose to the challenge here.\n\nGranit Xhaka led impressively. Enzo Le Fée grafted tirelessly, Brian Brobbey was a monster up front and Robin Roefs commanded his area with authority.\n\nThere were no backward steps taken and no sense of inferiority. The Lads knew that over ninety minutes, they could equal and maybe even best Newcastle, but believing it and executing when it matters are very different, yet this side boasts an elite mentality and an iron-clad self belief — something that’s grown during 2025.\n\nIn contrast, the visitors were utterly lacklustre and although the smokescreens of their European schedule and the supposed devalued nature of this clash (their words, not ours) may be used as mitigation, they simply didn’t turn up and that in itself was something of a shock.\n\nPost-match, Bruno’s now-predictable offerings about Newcastle “being a better team than Sunderland” felt somewhat inconsequential. They certainly weren’t on Sunday, and player for player, they haven’t been during 2025/2026 thus far.\n\nWhen Peter Bankes blew his whistle at full time, the post-match rendition of Wise Men Say — belted out proudly by the legions of Sunderland fans who didn’t want to leave a minute before they had to — seemed to carry even more weight.\n\nWe’re arguably more deeply in love with our football club than many of us have ever been, and days like this are the sweetest reward of all for the turmoil we’ve had to endure over the past decade. The ride continues, and I just don’t want it to stop.\n\nAs for Lord Gary of Rowell? We’ll miss him deeply and we’ll never forget him, but wherever he is now, he made the journey knowing that Sunderland AFC is a club reborn — on every single level.\n\nSunderland: 1 (Woltemade (og) 46’)\n\nSunderland: Roefs, Mukiele, Ballard; Alderete, Reinildo, Xhaka; Sadiki, Traoré (Hume 70’), Le Fée; Talbi (Mundle 83’), Brobbey (Isidor 70’)\n\nSubs Not Used: Patterson, Geertruida, Neil, Rigg, Adingra, Mayenda\n\nNewcastle United: Ramsdale, Livramento, Thiaw; Burn (Schär 42’), Hall, Guimarães; Tonali (Willock 59’), Miley, Elanga (J.Murphy 59’); Gordon (Barnes 59’), Woltemade (Wissa 75’)\n\nSubs Not Used: Ruddy, A.Murphy, Ramsey, Joelinton",

    "fullText": "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo must handle the twin challenges of scoring and captaincy when playing for Cameroon at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco this month.\n\nWith veteran striker Vincent Aboubakar surprisingly axed, the responsibility for scoring falls heavily on the 26-year-old who moved to Old Trafford from Brentford last July.\n\nGoals have been hard to come by for the Indomitable Lions lately as they failed to find the net in two crucial 2026 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nNeeding maximum points at home against Angola two months ago to have any hope of automatic qualification, Cameroon managed only a 0-0 draw.\n\nGiven a second chance to qualify a month later as one of the best four African group runners-up, Cameroon fell 1-0 to the Democratic Republic of Congo in a play-off and were eliminated.\n\nFor Cameroon supporters, recalling the past exploits of star strikers like Roger Milla, Patrick Mboma and Samuel Eto'o, consecutive blanks were difficult to accept.\n\nMbeumo started in both matches, but poor service from midfield and tight marking meant scoring opportunities were scarce.\n\nAboubakar was the eight-goal leading scorer in the 2022 AFCON as hosts Cameroon finished third behind Senegal and Egypt.\n\nIt was an outstanding performance in the modern era of the premier African football tournament, finishing just one goal shy of matching the 1974 record of Congolese Ndaye Mulamba.\n\nBut Mbeumo was left without a potentially key partner in attack when new Cameroon coach David Pagou omitted Aboubakar from the Morocco-bound squad.\n\n\"We wanted to do things differently. They are good players, but we set our sights on others to create a different mindset,\" said Pagou, referring to Aboubakar and goalkeeper Andre Onana.\n\nWhile Mbeumo seeks goals in Group F against Gabon, title-holders Ivory Coast and Mozambique, he must also shoulder the additional responsibility of succeeding Aboubakar as captain.\n\nHe must lift a team whose morale is low after their failure to qualify for the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nCameroon hold the African record for World Cup appearances with eight. Losing out to Group D winners Cape Verde, a west African archipelago with a population of just 525,000, was a bitter blow.\n\nMbeumo was born in eastern France to a Cameroonian father and a French mother, making him eligible to represent either country.\n\nHe played underage football for France before switching his international allegiance to Cameroon. His highlight so far with the Indomitable Lions was competing at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nAt club level, he spent one season with Troyes in France, then six with Brentford, helping the London club gain promotion to the Premier League.\n\nHe formed a dynamic attacking partnership with Democratic Republic of Congo winger Yoane Wissa at the Bees -- both scored in the same match six times last season.\n\nIt was a feat matched only by Liverpool pair Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo in the 2024-25 Premier League.\n\nHis six goals this season for United include a brace in a 4-2 home victory over Brighton.",

    "fullText": "Striker Mohamed Amoura is set to be a key figure as Algeria seek redemption at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in  Morocco after disastrous campaigns in the past two editions.\n\nThe Desert Foxes won the premier African football competition a second time in 2019, edging Senegal 1-0 in the final in Cairo.\n\nBut in two AFCON appearances since they failed to win a match in six attempts and twice made humbling first-round exits, leading to the sacking of coach Djamel Belmadi.\n\nHis place was taken by Vladimir Petkovic, who took Switzerland to two Euro Championship tournaments and one World Cup during a seven-year reign.\n\nThe 62-year-old born in Bosnia & Herzegovina rang the changes when he took charge of Algeria last year, including giving more opportunities to Amoura.\n\nHis faith in the 25-year-old, now with Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg, has been richly rewarded with Amoura becoming the leading scorer in 2026 World Cup African qualifying with 10 goals.\n\nAmoura tormented a variety of rivals as Algeria secured a fifth appearance at the global showpiece, scoring a hat-trick against Mozambique and two each against Botswana, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSince then he also found the net in an AFCON warm-up victory over Zimbabwe as Algeria prepare for Group E showdowns with Sudan, Burkina Faso and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nIt is a mini-league Algeria are expected to win, and Petkovic acknowledges that the Foxes are considered the strongest of the four contenders.\n\n\"The main objective is to get past the first round, (then) go as far as possible in the tournament,\" he said after announcing his squad.\n\nAmoura told the Algerian media he is optimistic Algeria will win Group E and qualify for the round of 16.\n\n\"It is a strong group. We respect every team, but fear no team. Algeria have a balanced squad that includes some outstanding players.\n\n\"Our goal is to go deep into the tournament and represent our country in the best possible way. We want to make our supporters happy and fight for the title.\n\n\"There is no secret to my scoring 10 goals in World Cup qualifiers. My achievements are due to hard work and the confidence given to me by my teammates and coaches.\n\n\"It is a huge honour to wear the Algerian jersey. I want to help my team as much as possible, whether it is scoring, creating goals or dropping back to defend.\"\n\nAmoura hailed Petkovic for creating an atmosphere during training camps that is conducive to success for a country that also won the AFCON in 1990.\n\n\"The atmosphere is excellent, It is serious, focused and there is a desire to give our best. It has to be that way because the 2025 AFCON is packed with strong teams.\"\n\nAmoura left Wolfsburg for Algeria at the weekend after scoring in a 3-1 league win at fellow bottom-half club Borussia Moenchengladbach.\n\nHe and Ivorian teenager Yan Diomande are the leading African scorers in the Bundesliga this season with six goals each.\n\nAmoura made his professional debut just five years ago with Entente Setif. He made an immediate impact leading to transfers to Lugano and Union Saint-Gilloise before joining Wolfsburg last year.\n\nHe initially left Union on loan, but the German club, releasing the potential of the Algerian, made the move permanent this year.",

    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah heads for Morocco this week to captain Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) amid uncertainty over his future at Liverpool.\n\nSalah came off the bench midway through the first half and set up the second goal in a 2-0 Premier League win over Brighton at the weekend.\n\nAfter the match, manager Arne Slot said there was \"no issue to resolve\" with his star forward, but speculation continues to rumble over the Egyptian's future after his outburst last weekend.\n\nThe 33-year-old came on as a substitute and seized his chance by setting up Liverpool's second goal for Hugo Ekitike. Salah had been left out of Liverpool's squad for Tuesday's Champions League victory at Inter Milan after his explosive rant about Slot following the recent draw at Leeds. That was the third successive game that Salah had been left on the bench and his furious claim that he had been \"thrown under the bus\" hinted at a potential departure from the troubled Premier League champions during the January transfer window.\n\nThe Nigeria defender scored in his side's 3-2 win at Burnley. Bassey grabbed Fulham's second goal to put them 2-1 up in the 31st minute en route to their first victory at Turf Moor since 1951. The 25-year-old's close-range header from Harry Wilson's cross was his first goal since an FA Cup tie against Manchester United in March.\n\nIBRAHIM SANGARE (Nottingham Forest)\n\nThe Ivory Coast midfielder capped his side's 3-0 victory over Tottenham with the final goal. Sangare netted in the 79th minute at the City Ground, bending a superb strike in off the post with the outside of his foot. The 28-year-old's second goal this season -- and his first in seven matches -- helped boost Forest's bid to avoid relegation.\n\nAKOR ADAMS, CHIDERA EJUKE (Sevilla)\n\nNigerians Adams and Ejuke celebrated AFCON call-ups with a goal each as Sevilla hammered Real Oviedo 4-0 in La Liga. Adams opened the scoring in the fourth minute and Ejuke completed the rout with one minute of regular time remaining.\n\nAmoura scored for the second straight match in Wolfburg's 3-1 Bundesliga win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. With the teams level after 34 minutes, Amoura was on the spot to blast in a deflected Christian Eriksen cross, putting the visitors back in front. The 25-year-old has six goals and two assists for Wolfsburg in the league this season.\n\nRAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Dortmund)\n\nBorussia defender Bensebaini scored his side's only goal in a disappointing 1-1 draw at Freiburg. With Dortmund teammate and Guinea international Serhou Guirassy struggling in front of goal and missing chances, Bensebaini took matters into his own hands with 31 minutes gone. The Algerian latched onto a Yan Couto free-kick and blasted home from close range.\n\nHIMAD ABDELLI, HAROUNA DJIBIRIN (Angers)\n\nAlgerian Abdelli converted an early penalty and Cameroonian Djibirin restored a two-goal lead on 85 minutes as mid-table Angers trounced lowly Nantes 4-1 in Ligue 1. Both Africans were scoring their second goals of the league campaign.",

    "description": "What are the Packers' playoff chances after their loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday? Latest odds, remaining schedule.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is called a week-to-week league for a reason.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers were reminded of that on Sunday.\n\nOne week they're living large having just overtaken the Chicago Bears for first in the NFC North, riding a four-game winning streak and climbing the playoff ladder. The next, they come crashing down with a stinging loss on many levels, falling to the Denver Broncos, while losing their spot in the division and falling to the seventh and final spot in the NFC playoff picture.\n\nThat's life in the crowded NFC when one loss can change your position very quickly.\n\nThe good news - though it might be hard for Packers fans to find it knowing the injuries the team suffered on Sunday - is that they can change their fortunes in six short days.\n\nThe Packers and Bears meet again and first place in the NFC North will again be at stake. A win will get them closer to punching their ticket to the playoffs.\n\nHere's the latest on the Packers' playoff odds, NFC North standings, playoff picture and remaining schedule:\n\nPackers-Bears Round 2 is up next.\n\nFor the second time in three weeks, the Packers (9-4-1) and Bears (10-4) will play with first place in the division on the line.\n\nThe Packers beat the Bears, 28-21, on Sunday, Dec. 7, in a thriller at Lambeau Field. Now, Green Bay heads to Chicago in the rematch.\n\nKickoff is set for 7:20 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 20, at Soldier Field.\n\nWhile their long-term prospects took a major hit with the latest round of injuries, the Packers are still in good shape to make the playoffs even after the loss.\n\nAccording to the New York Times' playoff simulator, the Packers have a 92% chance of making the playoffs following the games on Sunday.\n\nIf the Packers beat the Bears next week, their playoff odds will be greater than 99%. A loss drops their odds to 85% and fans will likely begin getting a little more nervous.\n\nEntering the game against the Broncos, there was a chance for the Packers to be the No. 1 seed after Week 15 if they won and the Los Angeles Rams lost. Well, both of those outcomes didn't happen so earning that top spot looks to be gone. They have less than a 1% chance to get the No. 1 seed, which comes with a first-round bye.\n\nThe Rams' win over the Detroit Lions did put greater separation between the Packers and their NFC North rival. The Lions (8-6) are two games back of the Packers in the loss column with three games to play. Two more wins for the Packers guarantees the Packers with a better record than Detroit. Green Bay beat the Lions twice this season.\n\nThe Lions' chances to make the playoffs is just 27% after Week 15.\n\nHere are the standings after Sunday's games. The Los Angeles Rams remained the No. 1 seed by winning a shootout over the Detroit Lions, while the Bears switched spots with the Packers after their win over the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay's loss later in the day.\n\nLos Angeles Rams: 11-3 (NFC West leader)\n\nChicago Bears: 10-4 (NFC North leader)\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: 9-5 (NFC East leader)\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: 7-7 (NFC South leader)\n\nSeattle Seahawks: 11-3 (first wild card team)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: 10-4 (second wild card team)\n\nGreen Bay Packers: 9-4-1 (third wild card team)\n\nIn the hunt: Detroit Lions (8-6), Carolina Panthers (7-7), Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1)\n\nEliminated: Minnesota Vikings (6-8), Atlanta Falcons (5-9), New Orleans Saints (4-10), Washington Commanders (4-10), Arizona Cardinals (3-11), New York Giants (2-12)\n\nThe Packers' loss dropped them from first to second in the division standings, while the Bears moved back to the top. The division lead will be back on the line when the two teams square off on Saturday for the second time in three weeks.\n\nChicago Bears: 10-4, defeated the Cleveland Browns, 31-3\n\nGreen Bay Packers: 9-4-1, lost to the Denver Broncos, 34-26\n\nDetroit Lions: 8-6, lost to the Los Angeles Rams, 41-34\n\nMinnesota Vikings: 6-8, defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 34-26\n\nThe Packers have just three games left on their schedule. Their next two games will be played on Saturday night.\n\nHere's the Packers' remaining schedule:\n\nat Chicago Bears, 7:20 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 20\n\nvs. Baltimore Ravens, 7 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 27\n\nat Minnesota Vikings, TBD, Sunday, Jan. 4\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Packers playoff chances: Next game, NFC standings, remaining schedule",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nChariton Arnold Ferrin Jr. was a basketball star in college while at the University of Utah. In 1944, he was named the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA Tournament as the Utes won the national championship, and three years later, he helped the school win a National Invitation Tournament title.\n\nThe Lakers took Ferrin in the third round of the 1948 draft, and he spent three seasons in the NBA, with all of them coming as a member of the Lakers. He averaged 5.8 points and 1.6 assists a game during that time and won championships during both of his first two seasons in the league.\n\nAfter his NBA career ended, Ferrin had a short stint as the general manager of the American Basketball Association's Utah Stars in the 1970s, and afterward, he was the athletic director for the Utes from 1976 to 1985. During his time as athletic director, the Utes won a total of 10 national championships, including four NCAA titles in women's gymnastics.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 18 — Chariton Arnold Ferrin Jr.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca is unlikely to get any \"protection\" after making cryptic comments seemingly aimed at the club's ownership, says former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney.\n\nThe Italian described the build-up to Saturday's Premier League victory over Everton as \"the worst 48 hours\" since he arrived at the club in June 2024.\n\nIn an extraordinary outburst, the 45-year-old suggested that he and his team had not been supported before refusing to clarify who his comments were directed at.\n\n\"For me it was very similar to the Mo Salah situation last week where it was very premeditated,\" said the ex England striker on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, which you can now listen to on BBC Sounds.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he is saying and who he is aiming it at and the board and owners at Chelsea will know it is aimed at them.\"\n\nChelsea currently sit fourth in the English top flight but had only taken two points from the previous nine available prior to the weekend with a loss at Atalanta in the Champions League also thrown into that run.\n\nAnd unlike the very public backing that Ruben Amorim received from Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe earlier this season, Rooney believes that Maresca's words will have done himself few favours if the club endure any further blips.\n\n\"You've got to respect the owners of a football club. They employ you and bring you in, so it's their way and I feel he's gone a bit against that,\" Rooney added.\n\n\"It is something that's clearly happened, whether it's a disagreement or he feels his job is under pressure and he doesn't feel it should be because of the two trophies he's won and the points he's picked up.\n\n\"I don't feel like he's a manager that will backtrack. He has got a passion about him and a drive about him. Whether he has heard things, like the club might want him out and he's been proactive to go on the front foot, you don't know why he's done it. It's very strange.\n\n\"I don't think he'll get the protection now he's come out and done what he has done. That will be very difficult for the club to come and protect him, which is a shame.\"\n\nWatch the Wayne Rooney Show on BBC Sport YouTube, and iPlayer.

    "fullText": "The Kansas City Royals made a trade with the Milwaukee Brewers to bring in outfielder Isaac Collins in exchange for Angel Zerpa. Collins posted a 118 OPS+ last season and is a great defensive outfielder. While Zerpa has value as a left-handed relief pitcher, Collins fits Kansas City's lineup well, which general manager J.J. Picollo acknowledged.\n\n\"At this point, we felt like this was a very good move for us considering our needs,\" he said (via Anne Rogers of MLB.com). “The need for on-base, the need for an outfielder. Adding a switch-hitter to our roster, and then Isaac’s positional versatility is very attractive when you combine that with the number of years of control.\"\n\nPicollo added, “We know right now that the outfield is the primary spot he’s going to play, but it never hurts to have a player that has been in other positions and done well in other positions. We feel like there’s a lot of upside to this and some safety at the same time. It helps you manage your roster well.”\n\nRoyals reportedly acquire OF Isaac Collins and RHP Nick Mears from the Milwaukee Brewers for LHP Angel Zerpa, per multiple reports including MLB's @Feinsand. pic.twitter.com/xrPq4uj8Gr\n\nCollins was drafted in the ninth round of the 2019 MLB Draft by the Colorado Rockies out of Creighton University. He debuted on Sept. 8, 2024, recording one hit and one stolen base in two at-bats. Across two MLB seasons, he has appeared in 141 games with 389 at-bats, 100 hits, nine home runs, 56 runs scored, 54 RBIs and 17 stolen bases. His career slash line is .257/.361/.398 with a .760 OPS and 113 OPS+.\n\nIn 2025, Collins played 130 games, tallying 98 hits, nine home runs, 56 runs, 54 RBIs and 16 steals. His 2025 slash line was .263/.368/.411 with a .779 OPS and 118 OPS+. This type of production, when paired with plus defense, is a great get for the Royals.\n\nAs for Zerpa, his Royals run ends after five seasons in KC. While with KC he logged 177.0 innings with a career ERA of 4.13. In 2025, Zerpa pitched 64.2 innings with a 3.86 ERA and 1.37 WHIP.\n\nOn Collins, Picollo added, “He does it in a different way. He gets deep in counts. He’s not afraid with two strikes. The contact rates are good. But I think the on-base is what separates him from what we don’t have right now or what we haven’t had a lot of success with. We need guys who can get on base around our top four or five guys.”",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are apparently leading the race to sign a Premier League player according to an exclusive report over the weekend.\n\nHowever, said player may well have his eyes elsewhere, which then makes me wonder, how can Chelsea be leading the race to sign him if he wants to go elsewhere?\n\nEither way, Chelsea are certainly one of the many clubs who have been looking at signing Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United.\n\nThe midfielder looks set to leave the his club very soon, and you wouldn’t bet against a move happening in the January transfer window due to the fact that Mainoo is just not being picked for United right now and will be in search of further minutes to go off and play for the rest of this season.\n\nI actually think for that reason that this would pretty much rule Chelsea out, because Mainoo isn’t going to be a starter in our midfield right now, is he?\n\nKobbie Mainoo warms up for Manchester United. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough at least 12 clubs are reportedly in the race, sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Chelsea and Bayern Munich are “leading the chase”. However, the player’s personal preference list still places Napoli as the frontrunner. Mainoo is prioritising where he can be a guaranteed starter as he plots his next move.\n\nThe end of this report is probably all you need to read about it. If Mainoo wants to go somewhere he can be a regular starter, then he isn’t going to chose Chelsea is he?\n\nUnless Chelsea got some big injuries to Enzo Fernandez and/or Moises Caicedo, then Mainoo is never starting ahead of them two. Then you have the likes of Andrey Santos who is even not getting much game time himself, waiting in the wings. Cole Palmer is back and will be playing in midfield too. There’s just no chance of regular game time there for Mainoo.",

    "fullText": "England have overlooked spinner Shoaib Bashir for the crucial third Ashes Test against Australia in Adelaide.\n\nThe tourists, who need to win to keep alive hopes of regaining the urn, have made one change from the team beaten in the second Test in Brisbane.\n\nAs expected, Josh Tongue replaces fellow pace bowler Gus Atkinson.\n\nIt is the omission of 22-year-old Bashir that is most striking for a Test where spin is likely to play an important role.\n\nEngland have instead retained all-rounder Will Jacks after he played his first Test in three years in Brisbane.\n\nIt is a huge decision by England captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum for a Test where jobs and reputations could be on the line.\n\nIt calls into question the entire experiment involving Bashir, whom England have asked to learn on the job in Test cricket over the past two years.\n\nBashir's absence from the first two Tests in Australia has been explained by the conditions.\n\nAustralia off-spinner Nathan Lyon bowled only two overs in the first Test and then was left out of the second.\n\nBut Lyon will return on Wednesday (23:30 GMT Tuesday) on a ground where no other bowler has taken more than his 63 Test wickets, with legendary Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne just behind on 56.\n\nThe importance of spin will likely be accentuated by the extreme temperatures forecast in Adelaide - as high as 39C for Thursday's second day.\n\nEngland have previously backed Bashir as their frontline spinner, despite him not being the first-choice slow bowler for his county Somerset. Bashir's deal at Taunton expired at the end of the season and he is yet to sign a new one.\n\nStokes and McCullum felt Bashir had the attributes to succeed in Australia, mainly a high release point and the ability to extract bounce from the surface.\n\nHis performances in an England shirt since making his debut in India at the beginning of 2024 have been a qualified success. Bashir's 68 wickets in 19 Tests have come at an average of 39, and in May he became the youngest England bowler to reach 50 wickets.\n\nBut Bashir has not played for England since breaking his finger in the third Test against India in July. His best moment in an England shirt was also his most recent act - taking the wicket to win that thrilling Test at Lord's.\n\nBefore the Brisbane Test, when off-spinning all-rounder Jacks was selected ahead of Bashir, Stokes still backed Bashir as the tourists' frontline spinner.\n\nEngland XI for third Ashes Test v Australia: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (captain), Jamie Smith, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Josh Tongue.\n\nNo batting changes for vital Ashes Test - McCullum\n\nFour decisions for England before third Ashes Test\n\nBut he has struggled in Australia, returning figures of 2-266 in two tour matches. Bashir has also looked short of rhythm in the nets.\n\nEngland did not select another specialist spinner in their squad - the likes of Rehan Ahmed, Liam Dawson and Jack Leach were overlooked.\n\nIt means England will rely on Jacks, primarily a batter and with six first-class wickets this year.\n\nIn contrast, Australia can call on Lyon, the 38-year-old who sits seventh on the all-time list of Test wicket-takers with 562. Lyon needs two in Adelaide to leapfrog great Australia seamer Glenn McGrath in sixth.\n\nSpeaking before England confirmed their XI, Lyon said: \"I would be surprised if their number one spinner is not playing. Will Jacks, I thought he played a pretty decent role in Brisbane with the opportunity he had.\n\n\"I'm not really concerned what XI England produce. We'll worry about what we're doing, and control what we can control.\"\n\nHead coach McCullum previously admitted England were unlikely to make changes to their batting line-up, so Tongue is the only new face from the side beaten in Brisbane.\n\nIn the pace department, both teams are likely to rotate in the final three Tests, which are played back-to-back.\n\nAustralia will have the luxury of Pat Cummins returning in Adelaide after the captain missed the first two Tests with a back injury.\n\nEngland's Atkinson struggled in the first two Tests. His three wickets have come at a cost of 78 runs each and two of them were taken when the second Test was as good as over.\n\nTongue, 28, has taken 31 wickets in six Tests, including dismissing Australia's Steve Smith in both innings when he played his only previous Ashes match at Lord's in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, England batter Harry Brook has recognised his own shortcomings in the series so far.\n\nBrook made 52 in the first innings of the first Test in Perth, but has not passed 31 in his three other knocks. He said the shots he played to be dismissed in the second innings in Perth and first innings in Brisbane were \"shocking\".\n\n\"Sometimes I've got to rein it in a little bit,\" said Brook. \"To learn when to absorb the pressure a little bit more and realise when the opportunity arises to put the pressure back on.\n\n\"I feel like I haven't done that as well as I usually do. There's no reason behind that, I just haven't identified those situations well enough.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Milwaukee second baseman has shown marked improvement at plate in his three MLB seasons. Hitting .300 might not be that much out of range for Turang.",
    "fullText": "In his three MLB seasons, Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Brice Turang has seen his batting average improve 40 points each season. He's continued to show marked improvement at the plate, which might lead some Brewers fans to consider this point.\n\nCould Turang hit .300 in the 2026 MLB season? Yes, he could.\n\nLook at Turang's power numbers. In 2023, Turang hit six home runs in 404 at-bats; in 2025, he hit seven home runs in 559 at-bats; and last season, Turang hit 18 home runs in 584 at-bats. As four doubles, Turang has gone from nine to 24 to 28 over his first three seasons.\n\nThis obviously shows that Turang is getting better and better each season.\n\nBrewers manager Pat Murphy might be smiling like a proud papa when he looks out at second base and sees Turang turning double plays with ease. \"He's a ballplayer,\" Murphy has said about Turang. \"You can see it. You can smell it. The best is yet to come for him. He's got so much to give.\"\n\nWhat's next for the Brewers' team MVP from 2025? He's going to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic next year. Turang has played for Team USA in teenage baseball series and remembers those times quite vividly.\n\n\"That was some of the best times that I’ve ever had playing baseball,\" Turang said, according to an MLB.com article. \"I was looking forward to seeing who the team was [for the 2026 tournament], and when I find out it’s me, I was like, 'Oh, man, I’m excited.'\"\n\nFor the Brewers, they want to make sure that they stay atop the National League Central Division again in 2026. They'd also like a return trip to the National League Championship Series and, potentially, knock off the Los Angeles Dodgers en route to their own World Series championship.\n\nTurang is quickly ensuring that he's a fan favorite, not only for his play on the field but how he handles himself as an MLB player.\n\nThe Brewers aren't going to bring a bunch of knuckleheads into the organization. Brewers president of baseball operations Matt Arnold is very selective on who he wants to bring on the team. And, yes, you better believe Murphy has a thing or two to say when new players are being considered for the ballclub.\n\nHe's worked hard to make sure the Brewers' clubhouse is strong and full of teammates that will stick up for one another.\n\nWatch for Turang to have a great 2026 and, hopefully, have a pleasant World Baseball Classic experience and avoid getting injured.\n\nRemember to join our BREWERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "description": "Seattle has found their backup backstop, potentially.",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Mariners are reportedly finalizing another small addition, signing C Andrew Knizner to a major league deal per Daniel Kramer of MLB.com. The veteran backstop will be 31 for the 2026 season, and seems likely to receive a league minimum-adjacent two-way deal that would allow Seattle to option him despite having exceeded his initial allotment of minor league options across the last seven seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Texas Rangers, and San Francisco Giants.\n\nKnizner (pronounced KIZ-ner, silent first ‘n’ and the z is before the second n) has a .211/.281/.316 line with a 68 wRC+ for his career, and an uninspiring -1.7 fWAR in 326 games and 975 plate appearances. Other estimations are kinder, with Baseball Reference’s bWAR seeing him as a 1.0 WAR player in his career, and WARP from Baseball Prospectus granting him a forgettable -0.1. What none of these estimations, nor Baseball Savant, seem to find impressive is Knizner’s defense relative to his peers, making the light-hitting righty a peculiarity in terms of his niche.\n\nKnizner hasn’t always been destined for a bench role. The 2016 7th rounder for the Redbirds was a steady hand at NC State University who moved behind the dish as a sophomore after initially playing 3B on campus. His strong offensive numbers up through the St. Louis system had him near the top of the Cardinals’ prospect list in 2019, as well as an inclusion in the FanGraphs top-100 list at 82nd, two spots behind Will Smith of the Dodgers and two spots ahead of Jarred Kelenic, newly of the Mariners. The acclaim followed representing St. Louis in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game, and Knizner was slated to be the eventual heir to Yadier Molina at Busch Stadium at his 2019 big league debut. While the expectation could not have been that Knizner would match Yadi long-term, the youngster struggled immediately, and served in an up-and-down backup backstop role for the next few years.\n\nHis keys to the starting job came in 2023, as Willson Contreras shifted out from behind the dish briefly, but Knizner’s best year at the plate could not overcome a surprisingly stagnant capacity for framing, blocking, and curtailing base stealers. He’s bounced up and down with a couple organizations since, and while his framing seems to have improved since leaving Yadi’s shadow, it is honestly surprising the M’s are pursuing Knizner for a big league deal, even at a presumably minute cost. Watching Knizner swing, you can see the Mitch Garver resemblance, and his ability to hit the ball hard was at one point above-average, though it’s not been present whatsoever in the past couple campaigns.\n\nThere have been teams willing to sign and play Knizner for the past seven years, and at one point he was a rather promising prospect. It could be Seattle sees something in him they think might be improved into a southpaw-swatting threat as they’ve long prized in a backup C, with Garver, Tom Murphy, and Luis Torrens in recent years. Without wanting to be too much more critical than this blurb has been/felt, Knizner has not yet been that player as a big leaguer. He’ll need to find that gear to emulate Murphy and Torrens more than Seby Zavala in his tenure.",

    "fullText": "It's inevitable that Liverpool will need to make additions to their midfield pack in the near future.\n\nAgainst Brighton on Saturday, the starting XI featured Florian Wirtz, Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones, with just Wataru Endo missing out with an injury. The slight caveat here is that Arne Slot chose against playing any out-and-out wingers in the front line.\n\nNonetheless, if this is the system that is going to help bring more consistency to the team's performances, then we might need to invest in signing greater depth to help make it happen.\n\nWhat's frustrating to hear, however, is that Liverpool are no longer in the running for one of the best talents available on the market, with other Premier League teams heavily interested in making a move.\n\nLiverpool's sporting director was praised heavily over the summer for the club's remarkable recruitment effort, and he's since come under fire for the team's poor form, with the new signings failing to hit the ground running. There is a multitude of different opinions on the transfer guru.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nRight now, however, it appears as though he might be making a big mistake when it comes to the speculation around young AZ Alkmaar midfield prospect Kees Smit, who could leave in January.\n\nThe I Paper is reporting that Chelsea are currently frontrunners in the race for him, with Newcastle, Tottenham and Manchester United all following behind. Right now, a £25m valuation has been placed on the 19-year-old star and it's expected that offers in that region could force the club to sell him.\n\nWhat's problematic here, is that Liverpool are not mentioned as one of the interested parties, when previous reports from CaughtOffside have extensively reported a different story. Since this is the most recent update we have on the Dutchman, it only feels right to take this information as gospel.\n\nThe report also notes that Smit's international manager Ronald Koeman said that he's a similar player to Pedri at Barcelona - comparing him to the former Kopa Trophy winner is an enormous compliment.\n\nAnd yet, it's probably the most apt way to describe him as a player, because his heat map for the season is all over the pitch, spreading far and wide. He's deep as a No. 6 at times, central in a more No. 8 style, and even getting goals and assists as a false No. 10. He has five goal contributions.\n\nWhat's perhaps most impressive about Smit is that he's played 2000 minutes for Alkmaar across this campaign so far, and we're only half-way into December. Having that level of fitness at his age, and delivering to such a standard that Maarten Martens doesn't feel he can drop him, is truly remarkable.\n\nFor around £30m, it's a no-brainer of a transfer move for Liverpool, especially when you consider how vast the Dutch contingent on Merseyside is. Cody Gakpo, Virgil Van Dijk, Jeremie Frimpong and Gravenberch, alongside Slot and his coaching staff, could all keep him company.\n\nAnd while it's already been said, it's worth reiterating how essential it is for the Reds to have midfield depth. Against Brighton, Slot used all but Endo in his starting XI. There was no one else on the bench.",

    "fullText": "Gian Piero Gasperini has been clear with the club: he wants at least one offensive reinforcement in January.\n\nThe target is a striker and the renowned right-footed left-back, but the manager would be happy with a versatile player like Fabio Silva, who could be back in fashion after summer interest.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee remains at the top of Frederic Massara’s list. He’s a No. 9 with the class of a trequartista who can play all attacking roles and who knows the Italian league well.\n\nNegotiations with Manchester United, however, are far from straightforward, which is why Roma is studying alternatives.\n\nAfter Celtic vs. Roma, Frederic Massara didn’t fly to the capital, but headed to England.\n\nRepresentatives of the 2001-born player awaited him there.\n\nThe Red Devils’ demands are clear: €30-35 million, immediately.\n\nHowever, as reported in Corriere dello Sport, the Giallorossi sporting director is ready to negotiate: he will free up space to offer the English club a costly loan, perhaps even exceeding €7 million.\n\nThe only certainty, however, is that Zirkzee himself will need to push for the transfer. The striker, however, is needed immediately; Gasperini needs him, and the tight league standings are a dream.\n\nSo Fabio Silva’s name is back in the news. The Giallorossi are reportedly ready to offer the German club the same deal they had for Zirkzee: a costly loan with an option or obligation.\n\nThe Portuguese has failed to establish himself in Germany and has collected one goal and three assists in just 364 minutes.\n\nThe 2002-born player had been waiting a long time for the Giallorossi in the summer, and continues to keep an eye on them: after a few months this push and pull could end with a happy ending.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea’s win over Everton at the weekend was pretty routine. What followed in the press conference was not.\n\nManager Enzo Maresca, in the middle of a routine answer about Malo Gusto’s form, suddenly started speaking in a passionate way about how this had been his “worst 48 hours” since joining Chelsea.\n\nNobody really knew what he meant, and his follow up answers remained cryptic. But it was clear he was upset by something, and we’ve been waiting to find out what.\n\nYesterday the well connected insider Ben Jacobs came through with an update, although it still doesn’t get too specific about what’s wrong.\n\nEnzo Maresca has a tense moment in his press conference.\n\n“Enzo Maresca has an internal issue at Chelsea which prompted his post-match comments about not feeling supported, talkSPORT understands,” Jacobs wrote.\n\n“talkSPORT understands his frustration has been brewing for some time despite qualifying for the Champions League in his first season in charge and claiming both the Europa League and Club World Cup.”\n\nSo it does indeed sound like this anger is directed at his bosses at Chelsea rather than at the fans or the media. That’s a pretty explosive move to make from the coach, and we still don’t know in what way he wants to be supported more. He’s clearly feeling comfortable in the manager’s chair if he’s making\n\nWe will find out more later today at the manager’s press conference ahead of our EFL Cup game against Cardiff tomorrow, although we can expect a very smoothed off, well rehearsed answer by then.\n\nTrevoh Chalobah was one of the stars of the show on Saturday and his stats highlight another excellent performance alongside Wesley Fofana in Chelsea’s back line.\n\nCole Palmer opened the scoring with a lovely run and finish after being picked out by Gusto. The game had been pretty pedestrian until that point.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s January transfer strategy is beginning to take shape, and it points firmly towards control rather than chaos. As first reported by Metro, Ruben Amorim is actively trying to block Kobbie Mainoo from leaving Old Trafford, despite growing interest from Serie A champions Napoli and the player’s own frustration at a lack of minutes.\n\nUnited are not expected to be overly active during the winter window after spending more than £200m last summer. Amorim added Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and goalkeeper Senne Lammens, reshaping the attacking unit while leaving some established names in limbo. With midfield reinforcements unlikely in January, protecting squad depth has become a priority.\n\nThis is where Mainoo’s situation becomes emblematic of United’s wider balancing act between short term results and long term asset management.\n\nKobbie Mainoo’s fall from prominence has been stark. Once viewed as one of United’s brightest prospects, his role has diminished sharply under Amorim. As Metro note, “England’s Euro 2024 star has started just one game this season – United’s Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town.”\n\nMainoo himself was keen to leave on loan last summer and is now reportedly desperate for a January exit to revive his career and keep his World Cup ambitions alive. Napoli, under Antonio Conte, see opportunity. Yet Amorim remains reluctant, aware that AFCON absences could suddenly elevate Mainoo’s importance.\n\nUnited’s restraint is driven as much by circumstance as strategy. Top midfield targets Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are unlikely to move mid season. As a result, United “will likely keep their powder dry until the summer transfer window.”\n\nThat caution explains Amorim’s resistance to departures. Losing Mainoo without a replacement would weaken flexibility during a congested second half of the campaign. United could climb to fifth with a win over Bournemouth, and European qualification remains firmly in sight.\n\nMainoo is not the only name drawing interest. Joshua Zirkzee, signed for £36.5m, has just one goal in nine appearances this season and is attracting attention from Roma and AC Milan. Ayden Heaven, Diego Leon and Sekou Kone are also considering loan moves.\n\nNapoli sporting director Giovanni Manna struck a measured tone on Mainoo, saying, “He’s a player who’s been linked to Napoli since August, partly because of his age, prospects, and opportunities.” For now, Amorim appears determined that those opportunities remain in Manchester.\n\nFrom a Manchester United supporter’s perspective, this report feels both reassuring and unsettling. Reassuring because Amorim is finally projecting authority, refusing to let promising players drift away in January panic deals. Blocking a Mainoo exit signals that the manager still sees value, even if his team selections suggest otherwise.\n\nAt the same time, it raises uncomfortable questions about squad management. If Mainoo is important enough to keep, why has he been marginalised to this extent. Fans remember the player who dominated midfield moments and started a Euro 2024 final. Watching him reduced to cameo appearances feels like a waste of both talent and momentum.\n\nThere is also scepticism around the wider transfer logic. United accepting that no midfielder will arrive in January makes retaining Mainoo sensible, but it also highlights lingering recruitment inefficiencies. Supporters want clarity, not just control.\n\nAmorim’s stance may pay off during AFCON when depth matters. Yet if Mainoo continues to sit unused, frustration will only grow. For fans, this feels like a holding pattern, necessary perhaps, but hardly inspiring. The second half of the season must bring either trust or transition, because standing still rarely works at Old Trafford.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets barely showed up on Sunday in a disgraceful display of football ineptitude. The Jacksonville Jaguars moved the ball at will against a no show Jets defense. The game turned into a rout early. It was over by halftime, with the second half functioning as extended garbage time. The Jaguars were so dominant they pulled their starters early in the fourth quarter as they cruised to a 48 – 20 blowout victory over a lifeless and seemingly disinterested Jets team. With the Jets eliminated from playoff contention, a large and growing list of injured players, and many of the remaining players looking like they have checked out for the season, these last three games are likely to be rough sledding.\n\nNext week the Jets go on the road to face a 4-10 New Orleans Saints team that has shown some life of late, winning three of their last five games, including a season sweep of the Carolina Panthers. The Saints are not a good football team, but they seem to be improving, and they certainly have not matched the Jets’ level of ineptitude lately.\n\nLet’s take a look at the current odds for this game according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The current line has the Jets road underdogs by 4.5 points. The game has an over/under of 40.5 points. On the moneyline the Jets are +176 and the Jaguars are -210. It is a mark of the depths to which the Jets have fallen that they are substantial underdogs to a Saints team that has scored more than 19 points just three times all year.",

    "description": "Mason Mount is delivering for Manchester United - but can his performances force him into Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad?",
    "fullText": "\"I have to tell you, I love that kid.\"\n\nRuben Amorim's first public observations on Mason Mount after his appointment as Manchester United head coach just over a year ago have stood the test of time.\n\nIt has taken longer than hoped for United's fanbase to come to the same conclusion, but Mount's goal and overall performance at Wolves last week had them purring.\n\nSuddenly, the hole left by the impending departure of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) doesn't look quite so difficult to fill.\n\nMount's game intelligence plus his awareness and ability to play in tight spaces are coming to the fore. Now the phrase most used about him is: \"His quality was never in doubt.\"\n\nAlmost two and a half years into the five-year contract he signed in July 2023, Mount's own bold declarations about the future have some meaning.\n\n\"I am hugely ambitious,\" he said on his arrival at Old Trafford. \"I know how amazing it feels to win major trophies and what it takes to do it.\n\n\"I will be giving everything to experience that again at Manchester United.\"\n\nIt is fair to say the statement of intent Mount made after completing his £55m move from Chelsea is yet to be fulfilled.\n\nMatch-winner Mount's quality 'never in doubt'\n\nAmorim hails Mount after win at Wolves\n\nA Champions League and Club World Cup winner with Chelsea, Mount was an injury-time substitute for United's 2024 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City. He started the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May and was part of the United squad that finished 15th.\n\nNot that the 26-year-old regrets leaving boyhood club Chelsea.\n\nSpeak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him.\n\nUnder Erik ten Hag at the time, the club made it clear they wanted him. That matters. It still does. That is why Amorim's first words were perfectly put.\n\nAs the former Sporting coach assessed the squad he was inheriting, he knew in Mount he was getting a high-level, flexible player who could fit into a variety of different positions within his system, something Amorim felt he did not have enough of.\n\nLeft, right, as an orthodox number 10, as a six, or an eight, Mount has a range of experiences that make him very useful for a coach who regards adaptability as a key weapon.\n\n\"He's a very smart player,\" was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. \"He's really technical.\n\n\"Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball. Mason can balance our team quite well.\"\n\nAmorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis.\n\nNo-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough.\n\nBut staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries.\n\nTraining-ground sources have said the player left no stone unturned in pursuit of staying fit and was regularly one of the last to leave after long stints in the ice bath and sauna sessions.\n\nHe is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results.\n\nMount is also well liked by non-football staff because he is helpful, which is not something that can be taken for granted in the playing department at United or any other club. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him.\n\nThese traits are all positives on a human scale.\n\nHowever, in the pressurised world of the Premier League, they are side issues compared to delivering on the pitch - and just now, he is on a roll.\n\nOutstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal.\n\nGoals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. His second in the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao - a two-touch, 50-yard effort to seal a 4-1 win - came out on top.\n\nThe idea over the next few weeks and months is to widen that particular area of debate as United push for a European place - their overall aim - and try to secure a top-five berth likely to deliver a return to the Champions League a year before schedule.\n\nMount won the most recent of his 36 England caps in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Qatar.\n\nDespite three years without an international appearance, Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel has not forgotten him.\n\nMount revealed in the summer his former manager at Chelsea had been in touch. The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted.\n\nThe player himself is not setting that as a target. Sources say his focus and drive remains on delivering on those first words following his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nMount recognises turning the United tanker around has to be a collective effort but there are signs it is heading in the right direction, even if the process is lengthy and not without the odd glitch.\n\nHe clearly has a significant role though. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. His impact is starting to be felt.\n\nJust as United prepare to lose two significant attacking forces to Afcon, they can look for Mount to deliver in their absence with an increased feeling of confidence.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The Responses API represents a powerful evolution in how we interact with large language models. Unlike traditional chat completion APIs that return simple text responses, the Responses API enables structured, multi-step workflows that can orchestrate multiple tools and produce rich, multi-modal outputs.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore how to build an AI-powered application that combines web search and image generation capabilities.\n\nSource Code: The complete example is available on GitHub.\n\nDocumentation: For comprehensive Responses API documentation, see the Responses API guide and Image Generation guide.\n\nThe Responses API is a more powerful alternative to the traditional Completions API. It enables structured, multi-step workflows with support for multiple built-in tools like web search and image generation, producing rich, multi-modal outputs that can be easily processed programmatically.\n\nBefore we dive into the code, let's ensure we have everything we need.\n\nOur example requires the following Rust crates:\n\nHere's the complete Cargo.toml for our example:\n\nYou'll need to set your API key as an environment variable:\n\nNote: Make sure to keep your API key secure. Never commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.\n\nNow let's construct our Responses API request. We'll create a request that uses both web search and image generation tools.\n\nModel Selection - We're using \"gpt-4.1\", which supports the Responses API and tool calling. Make sure to use a model that supports these features.\n\nInput Parameter - We use InputParam::Text to provide a simple text prompt. The model will:\n\nTool Configuration - We specify two tools:\n\nThe ..Default::default() ensures all other fields use their default values, which is a common Rust pattern for struct initialization.\n\nNext, we need to set up the Vllora LLM client with our credentials.\n\nThe client uses a builder pattern for configuration. Here we:\n\nTip: In production, consider using a more robust error handling approach instead of .expect(), such as returning a Result or using a configuration management library.\n\nNow let's send our request and see what we get back.\n\nThe client.responses().create() method:\n\nThe Response struct contains an output field, which is a vector of OutputItem variants. Each item represents a different type of output from the API:\n\nLet's see how to extract and display text content from the response.\n\nMessage Structure - Each Message contains a content vector that can hold different content types:\n\nAnnotations - Text outputs can include annotations which provide:\n\nThese annotations are particularly valuable when using web search tools, as they show where the information came from.\n\nThis is the core focus of our example - extracting and saving generated images.\n\nWhen the model uses the image generation tool, the response includes OutputItem::ImageGenerationCall variants. Each call contains:\n\nHere's our complete image handling function:\n\nExtract Base64 Data - We access the result field, which is an Option<String>. We use .ok_or() to convert None into an error if the result is missing.\n\nDecode Base64 - The base64 crate's STANDARD engine decodes the base64 string into raw bytes. This can fail if the string is malformed, so we use ? to propagate errors.\n\nSave to File - We use Rust's standard library fs::write() to save the decoded bytes to a file. We name it generated_image_{index}.png to avoid conflicts when multiple images are generated.\n\nReturn Filename - We return the filename so the caller knows where the image was saved.\n\nHere's how we integrate this into our response processing:\n\nWe match on OutputItem::ImageGenerationCall, extract the call, and pass it to our decoding function. We handle both success and error cases gracefully.\n\nLet's put it all together and see the complete flow:\n\nWhen you run this example, you'll see output like:\n\nThe actual news content and image will vary based on what's happening when you run it!\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use the Responses API to create multi-tool workflows that combine web search and image generation. The key steps are:\n\nThe Responses API enables powerful, structured workflows that go beyond simple text completions, making it ideal for building applications that need to orchestrate multiple AI capabilities.",

    "fullText": "The Republic of Rose Island (Esperanto: Respubliko de la Insulo de la Rozoj; Italian: Repubblica dell'Isola delle Rose, both lit. 'Republic of the Island of the Roses') was a short-lived micronation on a man-made platform in the Adriatic Sea, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) off the coast of the region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy, built by Italian engineer Giorgio Rosa, who made himself its president and declared it an independent state on 1 May 1968.[1][2]\n\nAlthough Rose Island had its own government, currency, post office, and commercial establishments, and the official language was Esperanto,[1] it was never formally recognized as a sovereign state by any country of the world. The Italian government viewed it as a ploy by Rosa to raise money from tourists while avoiding national taxation. Rose Island was occupied by Italian police forces on 26 June 1968, subjected to a naval blockade, and eventually demolished in February 1969.[3][4]\n\nIt is believed that the Esperanto term Rozoj (in Italian: rose) was borrowed from the surname of Giorgio Rosa, the designer and builder of the artificial platform, as well as the creator and inspirer of the state entity, as well as from his desire to \"see roses bloom on the sea\".[5]\n\nIn 1958, Italian engineer Giorgio Rosa funded the construction of a 400-square-metre (4,300 sq ft) platform supported by nine pylons and furnished it with a number of commercial establishments, including a restaurant, bar, nightclub, souvenir shop, and post office, with construction being completed in 1967.[6]\n\nThe platform declared independence on 1 May 1968, under the Esperanto name Insulo de la Rozoj, with Rosa as self-declared president. Rose Island issued a number of stamps, including one showing its approximate location in the Adriatic Sea. The purported currency of the republic was the mill, and this appeared on early stamp issues, although no coins or banknotes are known to have been produced.[7]\n\nRosa's actions were viewed by the Italian government as a ploy to raise money from tourists while avoiding national taxation. Whether or not this was the real reason behind Rosa's micronation, the Italian government's response was swift: On 26 June 1968, 55 days after the island declared independence, the Italian navy sent a group of four carabinieri and Guardia di Finanza officers, who assumed control, cleared the island, and set up a blockade so no one could re-enter.[7][8]\n\nAt first, the Italian government tried to dismantle the island, but they found it impossible, so they decided to blow it up instead. The Italian Navy bombed the island twice, with the first time failing, and the second bombing taking place on 13 February 1969,[9] but the island still stood. Afterward, Rosa's self-declared government in exile created stamps depicting the events. Rosa was billed by the Italian government for war costs. Finally, on 26 February 1969, the island was toppled by a storm. Only one death was counted but never confirmed: apparently, Rosa's dog was on the platform during the facility's detonation.[8]\n\nRosa died in 2017, having given his blessing for a film to be made about Rose Island. This was released in 2020.[10]\n\nSince the first decade of the 2000s, Rose Island's history has been the subject of documentary research and rediscoveries, based on the utopian aspect of its genesis.[11]",

    "description": "A deep, intuitive dive into why proteins are insanely complex, how folding defines life and disease, and how AI like AlphaFold finally cracked biology’s hardest problem.",
    "fullText": "You know what's wild? Right now, as you're reading this, there are approximately 20,000 different types of proteins working inside your body. Not 20,000 total proteins, 20,000 TYPES. The actual number of protein molecules? Billions. Trillions if we're counting across all your cells.\n\nEach one has a specific job. Each one has a specific shape. And if even ONE type folds wrong, one could get Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Parkinson's, Huntington's, mad cow disease, or any of thousands of other diseases collectively called \"protein misfolding diseases.\"\n\nYour body makes these proteins perfectly, billions of times a day, in every single one of your 37 trillion cells, without asking your opinion, without requiring a user manual, without ever attending a protein folding workshop.\n\nScientists spent 50 years, FIFTY YEARS, trying to figure out how to PREDICT what shape a protein would fold into based on its amino acid sequence. Entire careers were built on this problem. Nobel Prizes were awarded for incremental progress. Supercomputers were dedicated to simulating single protein folds that took weeks to complete.\n\nThen AI companies showed up in 2020 and said \"we got this\" and solved it in an afternoon.\n\nAnd now? Now we're not just predicting shapes, we're DESIGNING entirely new proteins that have never existed in nature. Proteins that can break down plastic. Proteins that can capture carbon dioxide. Proteins that can target cancer cells with sniper precision. We're playing God with molecules and it's working.\n\nBut before I tell you how NVIDIA went from making GPUs that render explosions in Call of Duty to designing molecules that might cure cancer, you need to understand what proteins actually are and why this problem was so stupidly, impossibly, hilariously hard that it became one of biology's grand challenges alongside \"how does consciousness work\" and \"what is dark matter.\"\n\nLet's start from scratch. Forget everything you learned in high school biology. We're doing this right.\n\nRemember from my previous articles: your DNA gets transcribed into RNA, which gets translated into proteins. That's the central dogma. DNA → RNA → Protein. Information flows one way. (Mostly. Retroviruses are weird. Don't worry about it.)\n\nBut what IS a protein? And I mean really, fundamentally, at the molecular level?\n\nA protein is a chain of amino acids that folds into a specific 3D shape, and that shape determines what the protein does.\n\nThat's it. That's the entire definition. A chain. That folds. Into a shape. That does stuff.\n\nBut as with literally everything in biology, the devil is in the details. And the details are where things get interesting (and by interesting, I mean \"ridiculously complicated but in a cool way\")\n\nThere are 20 standard amino acids that your body uses to build proteins. (There are actually a few more non-standard ones, but let's not complicate things yet.) Think of them as letters in an alphabet. But instead of making words and sentences, they make functional machines.\n\nEach amino acid has the same basic structure:\n\nLet Me Introduce You to Some Amino Acids (They Have Personalities)\n\nThe point is: these 20 amino acids can be arranged in ANY order and in ANY length to create proteins. And your body picks the exact right order to make each protein work.\n\nA typical protein has 200-400 amino acids. Some have thousands. Titin, the largest known protein in humans, has 34,350 amino acids. It's literally a molecular spring that provides elasticity to muscle tissue.\n\nLet's do some math that will hurt your brain:\n\nFor a protein that's just 100 amino acids long, there are 20^100 possible sequences. That's 1.27 × 10^130 possible combinations.\n\nAnd most of those sequences? They don't fold into anything useful. They're junk. They aggregate into clumps. They get degraded by cellular quality control. Only a TINY fraction of possible sequences fold into stable, functional proteins.\n\nNature had to search this impossibly vast space and find the sequences that actually work. And it did this through random mutation and natural selection over 3.5 billion years. Evolution is the ultimate brute-force search algorithm.\n\nBut we don't have 3.5 billion years. We want to design proteins NOW.\n\nWhen a ribosome finishes making a protein (remember translation from my last article?), it spits out a long, floppy, completely linear chain of amino acids. This chain is called a polypeptide, literally \"many peptides\" because each amino acid is connected to the next by a peptide bond.\n\nThe peptide bond forms between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next:\n\nThis creates a backbone (the repeating NH-CHR-CO pattern) with side chains (R groups) sticking out.\n\nAnd then, immediately, while the ribosome is still finishing the rest of the chain, something magical happens:\n\nThe chain starts folding itself.\n\nNo chaperone proteins initially (those come later if needed). No instructions. No assembly manual. No quality control inspector. The amino acids just start interacting with each other based on their chemical properties, and the whole thing spontaneously collapses into a compact, functional 3D structure.\n\nThis is called spontaneous folding or self-assembly, and it's one of the most beautiful phenomena in molecular biology.\n\nProtein folding is driven by thermodynamics, specifically, the search for the lowest free energy state (most stable configuration). Multiple forces contribute:\n\n1. The Hydrophobic Effect (The Big One)\n\nThis is the primary driving force for most proteins. Hydrophobic amino acids (like leucine, valine, phenylalanine) are energetically unfavorable in water. Water molecules have to organize around them in structured \"cages,\" which decreases entropy (disorder).\n\nThe system wants to maximize entropy. So what happens? Hydrophobic amino acids cluster together in the protein's core, away from water. This releases the ordered water molecules back into the bulk solution, increasing overall entropy.\n\nMeanwhile, hydrophilic amino acids (charged and polar ones) stay on the surface, happily interacting with water.\n\nThis creates a protein structure with:\n\nLike a molecular M&M. Except instead of chocolate, it's biochemistry.\n\n2. Hydrogen Bonds (The Backbone of Structure)\n\nIndividually, hydrogen bonds are weak (about 5% the strength of a covalent bond). But proteins have HUNDREDS of them. Collectively, they're incredibly strong.\n\nThese are called secondary structures, local patterns in the protein backbone.\n\n3. Electrostatic Interactions (Salt Bridges)\n\nOppositely charged amino acids attract each other:\n\nThese are called salt bridges or ion pairs. They're strong and help stabilize the folded structure.\n\n4. Disulfide Bonds (The Chemical Staples)\n\nWhen two cysteine residues come close together, their sulfur atoms can form a disulfide bond (S-S). This is a COVALENT bond, much stronger than the other interactions.\n\nDisulfide bonds are like staples that hold parts of the protein together. They're especially common in:\n\nInside cells (reducing environment), disulfide bonds are rare.\n\n5. Van der Waals Forces (The Weak but Numerous)\n\nWhen atoms get very close, they experience weak attractive forces called van der Waals interactions. They're tiny individually, but proteins have THOUSANDS of atoms in close contact, so collectively they matter.\n\n6. Entropy (The Desire for Disorder)\n\nFolding DECREASES entropy (the protein goes from a floppy, disordered chain to a compact, ordered structure). This is thermodynamically unfavorable.\nBut remember: folding releases water molecules from around hydrophobic residues, which INCREASES entropy. The net effect? Folding is favorable overall.\n\nSmall proteins (50-100 amino acids) can fold in microseconds to milliseconds.\nLarger proteins take seconds.\n\nYour cells are making proteins and folding them CONSTANTLY. Every second. Right now. While you read this.\n\nAnd here's the crazy part: the folded structure is reproducible. Given the same sequence, you get the same structure. Every time. It's deterministic (mostly, there are exceptions called intrinsically disordered proteins, but let's not go there).\n\nThis means the folding information is ENCODED in the amino acid sequence. The sequence contains all the instructions needed to fold into the correct shape. But humans don't know how to READ those instructions directly. We can see the sequence. We can see the final structure. But predicting one from the other? That took 50 years to figure out.\n\nThe final 3D shape is called the protein's native structure. It has several levels of organization:\n\nPrimary structure: The linear sequence of amino acids. Just the order.\n\nSecondary structure: Local patterns (alpha helices and beta sheets).\n\nTertiary structure: The full 3D arrangement of the entire protein chain.\n\nQuaternary structure: If multiple protein chains come together (like hemoglobin, which has 4 chains), how they're arranged relative to each other.\n\nThe native structure is the functional form. This is the shape that DOES the biology.\n\nAnd this is where things get critical.\n\nHere's the most important concept in all of protein biology, and I cannot stress this enough:\n\nA protein's function is ENTIRELY determined by its 3D shape.\n\nNot the amino acid sequence. Not the chemical properties of individual residues. The three-dimensional structure.\n\nChange the shape even slightly, and the protein stops working. Change it drastically, and you get disease.\n\nLet me give you examples that show just how insanely specific this is.\n\nEnzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions. Without them, most biological reactions would happen so slowly that you'd be dead. Your cells would be frozen in chemical slow-motion.\nEnzymes have a specific pocket called an active site, a precisely shaped cavity where the chemical reaction happens. The substrate (the molecule the enzyme works on) fits into this pocket like a key in a lock. The fit is SPECIFIC. If the shape is even slightly wrong, the substrate won't fit. The reaction won't happen. The enzyme is useless.\n\nLactase (The Enzyme That Digests Milk Sugar)\n\nLactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose (milk sugar). If you're lactose intolerant, it's because your body either stopped making lactase or makes a misfolded version that doesn't work. Result? Lactose sits in your intestines. Gut bacteria ferment it. You get gas, bloating, diarrhea. One misfolded protein = digestive chaos. You can't drink milk because your protein has the wrong shape. That's how specific this is.\n\nYour immune system has to recognize millions of different threats: viruses, bacteria, toxins, parasites. It does this with antibodies, Y-shaped proteins that bind to specific invaders.\nEach antibody is custom-shaped to recognize a specific molecular pattern (called an antigen) on the surface of an invader. The tips of the Y are shaped to fit that specific target.\nThe fit is so precise that an antibody designed for the flu virus won't recognize the common cold virus. Different shapes = different antibodies needed.\n\nThis is why vaccines work. You expose your immune system to a harmless version of a pathogen, your body makes antibodies with the right shape to recognize it, and now you're protected.\nIf the antibody shape is wrong, your immune system won't recognize the threat. You get sick.\n\nModern medicine exploits this by designing custom antibodies as drugs:\n\nThese are literally designer proteins with custom shapes targeting specific molecules. Billion-dollar drugs that work because the shape is right.\n\nHaemoglobin carries oxygen in your blood. It's shaped like a four-leaf clover with pockets that hold iron atoms, which bind oxygen. The shape is critical for function. Haemoglobin picks up oxygen in your lungs (where O₂ is abundant) and releases it in your tissues (where O₂ is scarce).\nBut if you change just ONE amino acid...\nSickle Cell Anemia is caused by a single mutation:\n\nPosition 6 in the beta chain of haemoglobin\nGlutamic acid (charged, hydrophilic) → Valine (hydrophobic)\n\nThat's it. One letter out of 146 amino acids in that chain.\n\nBut valine is hydrophobic. It creates a sticky patch on the surface of the haemoglobin molecule. When haemoglobin releases oxygen, this patch is exposed. Hydrophobic patches love to stick together. So sickle haemoglobin molecules clump together, forming long fibers. These fibers deform red blood cells into sickle (crescent) shapes.\nSickled cells:\n\nOne amino acid. One shape change. Lifelong disease.\n\nHere's where it gets truly terrifying. Prions are misfolded proteins that can convert normal proteins into the misfolded form, spreading like an infection. They cause diseases like:\n\nThe protein involved is called PrP (prion protein). Everyone has it. It's a normal protein on the surface of neurons. But PrP can misfold into a different shape, same amino acid sequence, different structure. This misfolded version (PrP^Sc) is:\n\nIt's autocatalytic. Self-replicating. And it destroys brain tissue.\n\nThere's no cure. It's 100% fatal. And it's all because of protein shape.\n\nIn 1969, a scientist named Cyrus Levinthal did some math and realized something disturbing:\nProtein folding shouldn't work.\n\nConsider a protein with 100 amino acids.\nEach amino acid has bonds that can rotate, and each bond has maybe 3 stable angles.\nSo there are roughly 10^95 possible shapes the protein could adopt.\nNow, let's say the protein can try one shape every picosecond (10^-12 seconds). That's incredibly fast, molecular vibrations happen on that timescale.\nHow long would it take to try all possible shapes to find the correct one?\n10^83 seconds.\nThe universe is about 10^17 seconds old.\n10^83 seconds is 10^66 times longer than the age of the universe.\nIf proteins had to randomly search for the correct fold, it would take longer than the universe has existed.\nBut proteins fold in milliseconds.\nThis is the Levinthal Paradox. Folding should be impossible. But it happens. Every time.\n\nThe Answer: Proteins Don't Search Randomly\n\nProteins follow a folding pathway, they don't try every possible shape. They take shortcuts.\n\nImagine a landscape with hills and valleys. The native structure is the deepest valley (lowest energy state). If the protein randomly wandered around, it would take forever to find the valley.\n\nBut the landscape is shaped like a funnel:\n\nIt's guided by the energy landscape encoded in the amino acid sequence. Evolution figured out sequences that fold efficiently.\n\nNature is smarter than random searching. Who knew.\n\nSo, proteins fold into specific shapes based on their sequences. Great.\n\nHere's what scientists wanted to do:\n\nGive me an amino acid sequence (like: MKTAYIAKQRQISFVKSHF...) and I'll tell you what 3D shape it will fold into.\n\nSimple request. Insanely hard problem.\n\nThis is called the protein folding problem, and it's been one of the grand challenges of biology since the 1960s.\n\nIf you can predict protein structure from sequence, you can:\n\nBut we couldn't do it. We tried for 50 years. And mostly failed.\n\n1. The Search Space is Incomprehensibly Vast\n\nWe already covered this. 10^95 possible conformations for a 100-amino-acid protein. Even with folding pathways, the space is enormous.\n\n2. The Interactions Are Complicated\n\nEvery amino acid interacts with every other amino acid. For a 100-amino-acid protein, that's nearly 5,000 possible pairwise interactions. And they all influence each other simultaneously.\nIt's like trying to solve a Rubik's cube where every move affects every other square in unpredictable ways.\n\nProteins fold in water. Water molecules interact with the protein, forming hydrogen bonds, pushing hydrophobic parts inward, stabilizing charged regions.\nYou can't model the protein in isolation. You need to simulate thousands of water molecules too. And water is WEIRD, its properties (hydrogen bonding, high dielectric constant) make it computationally expensive to model.\n\n4. Small Changes Have Big Effects\n\nChange one amino acid and the whole structure can change. It's not a linear relationship. The folding landscape is rugged, small mutations can shift the entire energy funnel.\n\nProtein folding is governed by thermodynamics. You need to calculate the free energy of every possible conformation and find the global minimum (most stable state).\n\nThis requires simulating quantum mechanical interactions between thousands of atoms. Computationally, it's a nightmare.\n\nX-ray Crystallography (1950s onward):\n\nGrow protein crystals → Blast them with X-rays → X-rays diffract off the atoms → Analyze the diffraction pattern → Reconstruct the 3D structure\n\nNMR Spectroscopy (1980s onward):\n\nPut protein in a magnetic field → Use radio waves to probe the positions of atoms → Reconstruct the structure from the data\n\nCryo-Electron Microscopy (2010s):\n\nFlash-freeze proteins → Image them with an electron microscope → Average thousands of images to get high resolution\n\nThis revolutionized structural biology (2017 Nobel Prize) but:\n\nNone of these methods PREDICT structures. They DETERMINE structures experimentally.\n\nScientists tried to simulate folding computationally.\n\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations:\nModel every atom in the protein and surrounding water → Calculate forces between atoms using physics equations → Simulate the motion of atoms over time (Newton's laws) → Watch the protein fold\n\nAnd even then, you might miss the correct fold or get trapped in a metastable state (local energy minimum that's not the global minimum).\n\nA software developed by David Baker's lab that uses:\n\nRosetta was better than nothing. It could sometimes predict structures for small proteins or proteins similar to known structures.\n\nIn 1994, researchers created CASP, Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction.\nEvery two years, teams compete to predict protein structures. Organizers choose proteins whose structures are about to be solved experimentally, teams submit predictions, and then the real structures are revealed.\n\nScores range from 0 to 100. Above 90 is considered competitive with experimental accuracy.\nFor 25 years, the best scores hovered around 40-60 for difficult targets. Progress was incremental. Slow. Frustrating.\n\nIn CASP13 (2018), a team from DeepMind (Google's AI lab) entered a protein structure prediction method called AlphaFold. It used deep learning, neural networks trained on known protein structures. AlphaFold 1 achieved a median GDT score of 58.9, placing first overall. The biology community took notice. This was the first time a machine learning approach significantly outperformed traditional methods. But it wasn't revolutionary. It was good, not great. There were still errors. Difficult targets were still difficult. Researchers thought: \"Okay, AI is promising, but we're not there yet.\"\n\nIn November 2020, CASP14 results were announced.\n\nDeepMind's AlphaFold 2 achieved a median GDT score of 92.4.\n\nLet me put this in perspective:\n\nAlphaFold 2 essentially SOLVED the protein folding problem.\n\nFor 87% of targets, it achieved GDT > 90. For some targets, it was MORE accurate than the experimental structures (because X-ray crystallography has its own errors).\n\nDeepMind open-sourced the code and released the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, predicted structures for 200 million proteins (essentially every known protein sequence).\n\nProteins are like language. A protein sequence is a string of letters (amino acids). Those letters follow rules (chemistry). The structure is the \"meaning\" of the sequence.\nAnd modern AI is REALLY good at understanding language patterns. That's what powers large language models. AlphaFold adapted the same technology, transformers with attention mechanisms, for proteins.\n\nAlphaFold doesn't simulate physics. It recognizes patterns learned from 170,000+ known protein structures.\nAnd it works. Ridiculously well.\n\nBut AlphaFold Wasn't Perfect. AlphaFold 2 was groundbreaking, but gaps remained:\n\nNVIDIA makes GPUs, your Graphics Processing Units. They were originally designed for rendering video game graphics. But GPUs are incredibly good at parallel processing, doing thousands of calculations simultaneously.\nAnd guess what needs massive parallel processing?\n\nNVIDIA realized: the same hardware that powers gaming can power drug discovery.\nSo they didn't just optimize AlphaFold to run faster on GPUs, they built an entire ecosystem for biological research:\n\nAnd they partnered with pharmaceutical giants, Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca, who are using these tools to design drugs RIGHT NOW.\n\nBasically: how gaming GPUs became the most important tool in modern drug discovery. And why this matters even if you've never thought about proteins before.\n\nPart 2 coming soon. This is where things get truly wild.\n\nDisclaimer: Everything in this article is scientifically accurate. Proteins really fold in milliseconds. AlphaFold really solved a 50-year-old problem. Your gaming GPU really uses the same architecture as drug discovery platforms. Biology is weird, AI is powerful, and we're living in the future.",

Yesterday Matthews was livestreaming from a lounge at Heathrow Airport when another man and his wife walked in; that man happened to be Ringo Starr, and Matthews did not recognize him.\n\nStarr was wearing a mask, but flashed his face just briefly enough for viewers to recognize him. After asking Matthews whether or not he was \"on the radio,\" Starr approached him. Matthews asked Starr where he was from, to which he replied, \"I'm from Liverpool,\" in what might be the most Beatles-sounding accent you can imagine. When Matthews said he'd just come from Manchester, Starr responded, \"We must be brothers.\" Starr's wife, Barbara Bach, noticed Matthews had been coughing and sniffling and asked him if he was sick. After Matthews said he was indeed feeling a little under the weather, Starr and his team left the room.\n\nOnce he was alone again, Matthews confessed to the livestream chat — who kept trying to tell him the man was \"Beatle Ringo\" — that he didn't know who the man was. \"His wife looked pretty classy, so he must be pretty high-value,\" Matthews said. \"Beatle Ringo? Who is that? Who the fuck is Beatle Ringo?... Is he on one of them statues from Liverpool?\"\n\nMatthews gave himself a brief crash-course in Beatles history, which was a good call on his part, because he wound up sitting right by Starr on his flight. They took a selfie together, which Matthews proudly shared on Instagram.

    "title": "From trees to graphs: speeding up vector search 10x with Hannoy",
    "description": "This is a walkthrough of a new LMDB-based HNSW Rust vector store with drastically better performances than the previous random-projection-based one. This is a disk-based HNSW highly vector store inspired by the DiskANN technology and is now used by default in Meilisearch.",
    "fullText": "This article aims to address several limitations of the current vector database used by Meilisearch, and to introduce hannoy: a graph-based alternative to arroy using LMDB, which is already part of Meilisearch since v1.21 (Sept 15) as experimental and the default one since v1.29 (Dec 8).\n\nEarly testing has shown that the new system can reduce indexing times from 2 days to 2 hours, decrease the on-disk index size by a factor of 2, and speed up search by ~10 times. When it was first put into production on an instance with indexing difficulties, it reduced the indexing latency from 2 months to... 6 seconds.\n\nTo illustrate why this is the case, I'll run through some key heuristics of graph ANN algorithms and share a few snippets from the code that are particularly illustrative. Finally, we'll share some benchmarks comparing the new solution to what's currently in Meilisearch today.\n\nI am not a Meilisearch employee or affiliated with the company in any way other than being a co-author on their new vector database.\n\nI first became aware of Meilisearch back in March, when my company began considering their enterprise solution for hosting and indexing our collection of ~10 million documents. As any sane person would do, I stalked their GitHub and was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of in-house crates they maintained and used in their search engine. Amongst them was arroy: a k-d trees inspired vector database, based initially on Spotify's similarly named project: annoy.\n\nWasting no time, I made my first open source contribution ever to the repo and... welp, it's still not merged 😔. But hey, as the French say: that's life.\n\nFortunately, I was still able to merge a few other PR's in the meantime and learn more about how the algorithm worked. The back and forth I had with other devs throughout the process (notably with @irevoire) was instructive and overall made it a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nAfter a couple of months of working on arroy, I naturally became aware of a few unsavoury trade-offs that lurked beneath the surface, and which ultimately motivated me to pursue a new approach.\n\nArroy is a k-d tree-based ANN algorithm, meaning that during indexing, you construct an ensemble of random partitions of your vector space, and at runtime, you search through them all simultaneously. To be more precise, it's random-projection-based.\n\nVisually, that process looks like the pic below:\n\nA widespread criticism of this type of approach is that search performance and latency degrade when the dimension of the embeddings exceeds about 20. Let's try to understand why.\n\nLooking at the code, we see that leaf nodes store as many vectors as the embedding dimension. This is a good and bad thing. In the extreme case where \"one leaf equals one vector\", e.g., you have a binary tree, each tree has height log2(n). By grouping d-many vectors in a leaf, trees can be built much faster since they only have height log2(n/d). For 1 million vectors of dimension 768, the numbers work out to building trees with heights of 10 versus 20; that's a 2.6 MiB versus 1.9 GiB in storage overhead for a single tree. This makes arroy B-tree-like, which is cool.\n\nWhere this is problematic, however, is at search time since you need to compare the query to each vector in a leaf. Even if you're only trying to retrieve the 10 nearest-neighbours, you still need to do 768 distance calculations 😔. That adds significant latency during retrieval.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no \"nice\" compromise; if you make leaves more granular, you need to store more nodes in the tree, which increases the index size in memory and exponentially increases build times, as we've seen.\n\nWhen using binary vectors and a bit-sampling hash, the memory overhead is just a single usize per node indicating the position of the random bit. This is the only case where we can afford to generate deeper trees, as storing a node on disk incurs next to no cost.\n\nAnother big problem with arroy is that the indexing algorithm is extremely read-heavy. That makes sense given that to create a hyperplane, you need to randomly sample points from the current node to generate clusters. The impact of this is so high that in some builds, over 90% of the time is spent doing IO and in page faults - a problem that only grows exponentially with dataset size. This phenomenon is still unresolved, as documented in arroy#145.\n\nOperational concerns aside, it's also just difficult to maintain arroy. There's a lot of mental gymnastics involved in understanding the recursive tree balancing algorithms, the creation and merging of temp files during partial builds, and the heuristics for auto-selecting build parameters. But hey, maybe that's a skill issue on my part.\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art ANN libraries employ graph-based approaches to achieve the optimal trade-off between search time and recall performance. Here, a navigable graph is built over all points in the database, and search is performed using a best-first traversal in log time. So rather than imposing structure on the dataset via separating hyperplanes like in arroy, techniques like HNSW and DiskANN focus more on building up pathways between points in local neighbourhoods.\n\nIf you haven't already read it, I'd recommend Pinecone's fantastic blog post on Faiss and the hnsw to get a working mental model of how these algorithms work. For the academically inclined, the original paper is also quite insightful.\n\nFor the search to converge quickly to the (approximate) nearest neighbour, the graph needs to satisfy what's known as the sparse neighbourhood graph (SNG) property. Put simply, points in a local neighbourhood of x should be closer to x than they are to each other. For the mathematically inclined, this property reduces to the relations below :\n\nThis equation is the \"secret sauce,\" if you will, of graph ANNs. Both the HNSW, DiskANN, and hannoy! rely on this to ensure efficient search.\n\nVector search over a graph has several advantages over space-partitioning approaches. First of all, it's extremely cheap to store node edges on disk at around ~200 bytes per vector even without using compressed bitmaps (which we do). For another, disk reads and distance computations at search time are significantly reduced as neighbours are explored one at a time instead of in large chunks. Insertions and deletions are also much simpler using a graph, as we only need to update the incoming/outgoing links from the modified nodes. In contrast, in arroy these operations potentially trigger tree re-balancing right up to the root.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, arroy is still great in the sense that it's disk-based, being built on top of LMDB. This means that you can build and search through indexes that are much larger than your machine's RAM using mmap. For reference, many popular HNSW implementations operate entirely in RAM, which is fast but requires multiple nodes and partitioning if the dataset becomes too large. So arroy was pretty avant-garde in that respect.\n\nHannoy is a graph-based successor to arroy with KV-backed storage via LMDB.\n\nThe goal of hannoy is to combine the best of both worlds from arroy and graph ANNs into a production-ready vector database that maintains and improves upon key metrics vs the legacy system. What's also neat is that it makes heavy use of crates maintained by the Meilisearch devs, such as heed, roaring-rs, and steppe.\n\nIts implementation is inspired by a few projects, notably Faiss' HNSW and the hnsw crate, but with significantly more support for zero-copy semantics, persistence, SIMD, and online updates & multi-phase indexing. There are also several novel techniques inspired by research papers to handle tasks such as graph merges and layer exploration.\n\nThe most interesting engineering challenge of the project was determining how to handle incremental insertions and deletions to the graph over its lifetime. After all, we expect users' databases to grow over time, and not all their data is available immediately. The industry standard for graph algorithms had been to periodically rebuild the index either on a cron-like schedule or after sufficient updates had accumulated. The FreshDiskANN paper summarizes this issue with this type of approach succinctly:\n\nIt would take about 1.5-2 hours on a dedicated high-end 48-core machine to build a good-quality HNSW index over 100M points. So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billion point index. [1]\n\nLuckily for us, Microsoft has already solved this problem. The idea essentially boils down to avoiding eager updates to the graph by orchestrating a streaming delete/insert/merge operation once the size of a particular in-memory temporary index reaches a critical size. While this is certainly a proven strategy, with hannoy we aimed to implement something a bit less complicated, but which still makes liberal use of techniques from DiskANN (even though technically hannoy is an HNSW).\n\nWhen items are added or deleted from the graph, a special Updated key is written to the database pointing to the modified node. Before building the index, we generate a bitset of items that are (i) new, (ii) modified, or (iii) removed & pass those to the HnswBuilder. The deletion bitset plays a special role at the end of the build where instead of just removing any edge $(e,d)$ between an existing and deleted item, we explore the neighbourhood of $d$ to patch the links of $e$ à la DiskANN. This prevents \"gaps\" from appearing in the graph and ensures search still converges quickly (recall that SNG property from earlier 😉).\n\nThe code below shows how we accomplish this in hannoy:\n\nAnother interesting feature of hannoy is how the new graph (in RAM) is merged with the old one (from disk, in LMDB). For each batch of points to be inserted, we build a brand new HNSW in RAM. To ensure that this new graph connects to the old one, we reschedule the entry points of the old graph for re-indexing in the new one. Every time we need to access an item's links, we look in both memory and LMDB. This way, we can establish connections with the larger disk-based index in a lazy manner. This is essential, as otherwise, any new vectors inserted into the database after the initial build would be unreachable; you'd only be able to search in disjoint graphs, and recall would suffer.\n\nThis strategy actually works well in practice ! By re-indexing <<1% of the vectors in the original graph, we're able to merge on-disk and in-memory indexes seamlessly. To the best of my knowledge, this is a novel technique that no other HNSW implementations utilize for handling incremental builds, and it is essential to the use case at Meilisearch, where batch insertions are heavily used.\n\nThere are tons of other cool sub-problems like those that we address in hannoy, but I'll save those for another post. The important part to retain here is that hannoy is \"a DiskANN-inspired HNSW implementation with LMDB-backed storage\".\n\nI like making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of my system as much as the next guy, but there comes a point when it's time to share some hard numbers. That time is now!\n\nTo facilitate comparison between the old system and the new one, we'll utilize the trusty vector-store-relevancy-benchmark from Meilisearch, as featured in previous blog posts. The important metrics we'll be comparing are recall (1, 10, 50, 100), indexing time, retrieval latency, and disk usage for various datasets with differing embedding dimensions. To simplify the process, we'll run the benchmark on 1 million documents using cosine as the indexing/retrieval distance metric in full precision. We'll also run the benchmark using each database's preferred quantization format.\n\nWhen quantization is enabled, arroy by default uses the cosine distance over the [0,1]-valued vectors. In hannoy, we've noticed that the hamming distance between binary strings (x^y) is vastly more performant in both speed and recall. Intuitively, the speed part makes sense as the distance computation reduces to popcnt's !\n\nThe results I'll be sharing are cherry-picked from the much more complete benchmarking summary in hannoy.\n\nNote that the reported search latency numbers represent the cold-start times. In reality, search times will speed up as more of the database is loaded into the page cache. From the flamegraph below, we can see that ~25% of our time is spent on mdb_get calls, so running a few warmup queries could significantly reduce retrieval times.\n\nAs you can see from these numbers, hannoy certainly improves upon all of the metrics we discussed - and by quite a large margin. In some cases, indexing times drop by nearly 10x, while the same amount improves search latencies.\n\nHaving a bit of free time on my hands, I thought I'd tackle writing the Python bindings for hannoy using pyo3. With these in place, it becomes much easier to integrate the project with the renowned ANN Benchmarks leaderboard.\n\nWhat's cool here is that even with the log(n) lookups from LMDB and potential page faults in our mmap, we're still beating in-memory annoy (arroy but in C) and competitive enough with Faiss' implementation. This graph indicates that we still have some work to do in terms of performance. Still, considering it was an initial implementation thrown together fairly quickly, it's certainly a good start. The most essential things for hannoy are ensuring that we keep the same API as arroy to facilitate integration in Meilisearch, and of course, that it improves on the metrics with respect to the previous system.\n\nI covered a lot of ground in this blog post, but still haven't answered the essential question \"Why the HNSW and not DiskANN?\" - and to be honest, I still don't have a satisfactory answer.\n\nOn one hand, the HNSW seemed the easiest out of the two to implement, given our constraint of using LMDB as a storage backend (DiskANN has a lot of async IO going on to maximize throughput on SSD reads, which aren't as straightforward to implement using mmap). From another perspective, HNSW is the gateway to graph ANNs and seemed like a good first approach to try out, validating whether this was a valid alternative to Meilisearch's prevailing vector database. If convincing results could be obtained with relatively little effort, it was certainly worth trying out. That being said, DiskANN and FreshDiskANN certainly influenced many of my design choices throughout, and I'm sure the project will evolve to resemble them more closely.\n\nI published this article everywhere on the internet, and if you want to comment, please take a look at Lobste.rs, Hackernews, Reddit, Twitter, Bsky or even post a comment in here 👇",

    "fullText": "With British airports Heathrow and Gatwick both landing among the top 10 busiest airports in Europe, the two have also struggled to decrease the flow of traffic around the areas where drivers drop off passengers.\n\nFollowing a similar decision made at Heathrow (LHR) earlier this year, Gatwick Airport (LGW) in the West Sussex county south of central London is also raising the price of driving up to the airport without stopping.\n\nThe fee increase, which does not apply to cars operating for rideshare companies like Uber and Bolt, comes into effect on January 6 and increases the fee charged to those dropping off friends and family by 43% from £7 to £10 ($13.37 USD).\n\nIt is also a significantly bigger jump than the £6 to £7 increase implemented at Heathrow, the main London airport serving flag carriers and mainstream airlines, for next year.\n\n\"This increase in the drop-off charge is not a decision we have taken lightly; however, we are facing a number of increasing costs, including a more than doubling of our business rates in the recent Budget,\" an airport spokesperson said in a statement reported by BBC and other local press outlets.\n\nThe airport also blamed higher business rates introduced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves as the reason for the price increase that it's now passing on to the airport visitors in different ways.\n\nThe increases at both Heathrow and Gatwick have been met with strong opposition from locals who regularly come to the airport. They see it as an example of price-gouging, presented as a \"benefit\" for passengers, or to shame people for not taking public transit to help the environment.\n\n\"Heathrow's decision to increase its terminal drop-off fee to £7 and introduce a strict 10-minute limit is yet another example of rising airport charges impacting the very people who keep our economy moving,\" Clive Wratten, who heads the British Business Travel Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"The words 'Happy New Year' are unlikely to be uttered by drivers dropping off friends and family at Gatwick in January,\" Rod Dennis, a senior policy advisor for British road breakdown service provider RAC, told The Independent.\n\n\"[...] Drivers tell us the main reason they use drop-off facilities at airports is to help people with bulky or heavy luggage – something that can be incredibly impractical on public transport, especially if elderly relatives or young children are in tow.\"",

    "fullText": "Funding to research new ways to control the sea lamprey, the invasive vacuum cleaner of the Great Lakes, is at risk. The development is prompting concerns from locals and observers.\n\nWisconsin Public Radio reported on how threatened funding and potential newfound resilience could lead to a comeback for the prolific fish-killer. The invasive lamprey uses a powerful suction-cup mouth to attach to fish, employs its 100 jagged teeth, and then kills them at a ruthless six-in-seven rate.\n\n\"They're kind of something out of a horror movie,\" journalist Katie Thornton told WPR. While the lamprey spares humans from its wrath, its presence can devastate native fish such as lake trout and whitefish.\n\nThat was what happened from 1944-1954, when Lake Michigan's commercial trout harvests decreased by a remarkable 98%. The government responded by forming the nonprofit Great Lakes Fishery Commission in the 1950s.\n\nThis organization discovered a chemical that specifically targeted lampreys, leading to a revival of native fish populations. From there, it was smooth sailing until the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, cuts by the Department of Governmental Efficiency impacted treatment.\n\nWhile that funding and staffing have been restored, there are concerning signs that the lamprey may be developing immunity to the pesticide. That alarm is heightened by the Trump administration's proposed 79% funding cut to the Great Lakes Science Center, a key player in researching alternative treatments.\n\nLeft untreated, the invasive sea lamprey is a complete menace. During COVID, Thornton revealed that one lake exploded with a tenfold rise in lampreys in just one year. That spells certain doom for fish that are both food and livelihood for many Midwesterners.\n\nWhile the threat has been neutralized for some time with an effective pesticide and treatment, resting on those laurels is a dangerous proposition. The invader is lethal and can make an impact incredibly quickly. Getting caught flat-footed would be devastating to the local fish population.\n\nThornton revealed that the process of identifying the chemical that controls lamprey took over five years and 5,000 attempts, which shows the dangers of waiting.\n\nThornton suggested to WPR that even in a Michigan region that is generally pro-Trump, there was widespread support for preserving the research funding. Locals remember the havoc the sea lamprey can wreak on the fish population and aren't eager to take their chances.\n\nDo you worry about companies drilling too deep into the ground?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile the funding remains in balance, scientists are working on alternative paths to controlling the invasive species.\n\nThese involve a lot of cutting-edge technology, like electric dams that keep lampreys out through transmitted electric currents. Artificial intelligence is another option for detecting fish and blocking them from entering unwanted waters.\n\nA different approach includes using the scent of dead lampreys to control their movements. Another venture includes introducing sterile males into the population.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

No phone call. No detailed explanation. No chance to fix the problem before the holiday shipping window closed (1). Making matters more confusing: roughly 300 boxes with identical labeling made it to their destinations without issue (2).\n\n\"We've sent packages for a good ten years and never had issues,\" Kristen Gauvin, president of Boxes to Boots, told WTNH. \"We did our due diligence with researching proper coding this year and hit a roadblock and weren't getting answers\" (3).\n\nThe organization had already spent more than $10,000 in shipping costs.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers.

But the situation isn't fully resolved: approximately 150 packages remain missing, and some boxes marked for the Connecticut National Guard are still awaiting shipment (7).\n\nWhat happened to Boxes to Boots isn't an isolated incident.

    "description": "Gottlieb played college basketball at Brown and said she had a teammate whose daughter had to shelter in place in a library basement.",
    "fullText": "USC women’s basketball head coach Lindsay Gottlieb opened her postgame news conference after the No. 16 Trojans’ loss to No. 1 UConn on Saturday night with her thoughts on the mass shooting that took place at Brown University.\n\nProvidence police said Sunday morning that they had detained a person of interest after two people were killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting on campus during finals. The person is in their 30s. The shooting happened in an engineering building on campus as people in the area were told to shelter in place for hours afterward as police looked for the shooter.\n\nGottlieb played basketball at Brown and said that she checked her phone after the game to see many text messages about the shooting. She said she felt she needed to address the shooting because it was more important than basketball and that “we can all be better.”\n\n“It doesn’t need to be this way,” Gottlieb said. “Sending thoughts and prayers to my teammates who have kids there. To the parents that have to worry about their children, I’m just going to end it with that, but just to say we’re the only country that lives this way. The college football cycle has been in the news a million times and are we going to report about this? It’s the guns. We’re the only country that lives this way. Parents should not be worried about their kid — I have a teammate who has a daughter who is in the basement of a library because they don’t know what’s going on there. And she’s flying there tomorrow.\"\n\nPolice said the shooter had a handgun and fired more than 40 rounds during the incident. The mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, said that the building’s outside doors were unlocked but that access to the classrooms where exams were taking place required a badge.\n\nGottlieb has been USC’s coach since 2021 after she spent two seasons as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers following her time as Cal’s head coach. She played at Brown from 1995-99 and immediately got into coaching after her collegiate playing career was over.\n\nUSC lost 79-51 at home to UConn on Saturday night as the Trojans play the season without injured star JuJu Watkins. She injured her knee in the 2025 NCAA tournament before USC fell to UConn in the Elite Eight a season ago. Watkins, who suffered a torn ACL, will miss the entire 2025-26 season.",

    "fullText": "Snowfall reports now range from about 1 inch in parts of the city to nearly 9 inches in the northwestern suburbs.\n\nHighest totals so far include 8.8 inches in East Nantmeal Township, 8.7 inches in Blue Bell and 8.5 inches in East Nottingham Township.\n\nNew National Weather Service data through 10:30 a.m. shows 3 to 5 inches across much of Philadelphia and nearby suburbs.\n\nPHILADELPHIA - Snow stacked up quickly across the Philadelphia region Sunday, with new reports showing nearly 9 inches in some suburbs and several inches on the ground in much of the city.\n\nThe latest Public Information Statement from the National Weather Service office in Mount Holly, issued at 10:36 a.m. Sunday, shows significantly higher snowfall totals than the early-morning reports. Many communities that were sitting at 1 to 3 inches before sunrise are now in the 5 to 8 inch range, especially north and west of Philadelphia.\n\nIn the city, an observation from Center City lists 3.6 inches of snow, while neighborhoods in the Northeast like Fox Chase, Bustleton and Somerton are reporting between 4 and 5 inches. An official reading at Philadelphia International Airport shows 1.3 inches, underscoring the sharp gradient from the airport to the rest of the city.\n\nThe heaviest bands have focused on parts of Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, Lehigh, Carbon and Northampton counties, where multiple towns are now reporting 7 to 8 inches. South Jersey and northern Delaware have also seen a solid plowable snow, with widespread 4 to 7 inch totals in some communities.\n\nThese totals are based on reports collected through about 10:30 a.m. Sunday and may continue to rise where snow is still falling.\n\nCenter City/Philadelphia (observer): 3.6\"\n\nPhiladelphia International Airport: 1.3\"\n\nAtglen / West Sadsbury Twp: 7.8\"\n\nHarleysville / Salford Twp: 7.5\"\n\nPottstown area (including Stowe and NE Pottstown): 6.6\"–7.3\"\n\nWillow Grove / Jenkintown corridor: 6.0\"–6.4\"\n\nPerkasie / Souderton / Trumbauersville: around 7.0\"\n\nNewtown / Langhorne area: around 6.0\"\n\nBerks, Lehigh, Carbon and Northampton counties\n\nEast Nantmeal / Alburtis / Earl Twp / Lake Harmony / Lehigh Twp (Carbon): around 7.0\"–8.0\"\n\nMount Laurel / Burlington: 5.8\"\n\nWashington Twp (Gloucester): 5.5\"\n\nMonroe Twp (Gloucester): around 4.0\"\n\nAtlantic, Salem and Cumberland counties\n\nAtlantic City International Airport: 0.6\"\n\nNew Castle County Airport: 3.3\"\n\nSmyrna / Clayton / Cheswold area: around 2.0\"\n\nHighest total so far: 8.8\" in East Nantmeal Township (Chester County)\n\nOther standout totals: 8.7\" in Blue Bell (Montgomery County), 8.5\" in East Nottingham Township (Chester County), 8.0\" in Doylestown area, Coopersburg and parts of Carbon County\n\nCity of Philadelphia: generally 3\"–5\" away from the airport, with around 3.6\" in Center City and up to 5.0\" in Fox Chase\n\nMany suburbs: now in the 5\"–8\" range, especially north and west of the city\n\nSnow continues to impact travel across the region Sunday, with many neighborhood and secondary roads still snow-covered or slushy.

The LAPD said in an X statement that its Robbery Homicide Division was investigating an apparent homicide.\n\nIn a Sunday night statement, LA Mayor Karen Bass confirmed the Reiners' deaths and said that the investigation was ongoing.\n\nLAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton said in a Sunday night press conference that the department was not seeking anyone as a suspect or person of interest in the case, and that the LAPD would speak with the couple's family members in the investigation.\n\nRepresentatives for the family did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nFormer House Speaker and California Rep. Nancy Pelosi said in an X post on Sunday that the news was \"devastating.\"\n\n\"It's hard to think of anyone more remarkable and excellent in every field and endeavor they pursued,\" Pelosi wrote.\n\nShe added, \"Rob was creative, funny, and beloved. And in all of their endeavors, Michelle was his indispensable partner, intellectual resource, and loving wife.\"\n\nReiner had a long and illustrious career in Hollywood. The son of actor, director, and screenwriter Carl Reiner, he studied at the UCLA Film School before starting his directing journey.\n\nHe directed several iconic Hollywood movies, including \"This is Spinal Tap\" in 1984, \"The Princess Bride\" in 1987, and \"When Harry Met Sally\" in 1989.\n\nReiner also appeared in several acting stints, including movies such as the 2013 Martin Scorsese blockbuster \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and TV series \"New Girl\" and \"The Bear.\"\n\nIn 1987, he founded Castle Rock Entertainment, a production company, alongside a group of film producers. The company is now a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nReiner and his wife had three children together: Nick, Jake, and Romy Reiner. He has one daughter, Tracy Reiner, from his previous marriage to actor Penny Marshall.\n\nNick Reiner battled drug abuse in his teens and early adulthood. His experience, including stints in rehab, led him to write the screenplay for \"Being Charlie,\" a 2015 romance-drama that his father directed.\n\nIn 2016, Reiner told Business Insider that his son was the \"heart and soul of the film.\"",

    "fullText": "Michelle Obama says her mother didn't shy away from talking about death while she was growing up.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday's episode of her \"IMO\" podcast, featuring guest Anderson Cooper, Obama said it was her mother's way of preparing her and her brother for the inevitable.\n\nHer comments came after Cooper shared that his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, also spoke openly about her mortality when he was young.\n\n\"I think she wanted me to know throughout my life, she wanted to hand us our lives early. Like you're responsible. You did this for yourself,\" Obama said. \"My mom would always say, and she would say this publicly, 'I didn't have anything to do with raising Michelle and Craig. They, you know, they always knew this.'\"\n\nObama added that she believed her mother said it to reassure herself that her children would be able to manage on their own, even when she was no longer around.\n\n\"And I didn't understand that until I had kids. And I realized that the scariest thing is not just losing them or something happening to them. It's something happening to me, and my kids are going to go through life not feeling like they have what they need to get through.\"\n\nThe former first lady, who has two daughters with her husband, Barack Obama, said her mother always reassured her that she was sensible and already making sound decisions even as a child.\n\n\"I think she was trying to tell me what you came to realize, that if you know your parents' values and their core, you've seen them, you've experienced them. If there's a loss, you're going to be OK,\" Obama said.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Obama has spoken about the lessons she learned from her mother, who died in May 2024.\n\nIn June, she said her mother was always upfront with her kids about her own shortcomings.\n\n\"What I remember so distinctly is Mom saying on more than one occasion, 'Hey, look, this is my first time being a parent, and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.' And that always resonated with me,\" Obama said.\n\nIn November, Obama said one of her final conversations with her mother pushed her to be more intentional about how she spends her time now that she's in her 60s.\n\n\"If I'm lucky, I live to 90 and that's 30 good summers,\" Obama said.",

    "title": "AI is triggering a quiet hiring comeback for some entry-level talent, say public company CEOs",
    "description": "A new survey shows CEOs expect AI to boost hiring in 2026, especially for entry-level roles.",
    "fullText": "AI may be blamed for this year's layoffs, but a new global survey says the technology could fuel a rebound in some entry-level hiring next year.\n\nPublic-company CEOs say AI is creating more jobs in 2026, according to an annual outlook survey conducted by advisory firm Teneo released this month. Sixty-seven percent of the CEOs surveyed said they expect AI to increase entry-level hiring in 2026, and 58% said they plan to add senior-leadership roles as well.\n\nThe report said that firms are ramping up hiring in engineering and AI-related roles. Many existing jobs are being reconfigured or reassigned as certain tasks become increasingly automated.\n\nThe survey, conducted between October 14 and November 10, gathered responses from more than 350 global CEOs leading public companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue, as well as about 400 institutional investors representing $19 trillion in portfolio value.\n\nThe findings run counter to the prevailing narrative that AI is automating entire jobs away.\n\n\"It's not that AI is wiping out the workforce today — it's reshaping it,\" said Ryan Cox, Teneo's global head of AI.\n\nThe hiring momentum mirrors a broader surge in corporate AI investment. Sixty-eight percent of CEOs said they plan to increase AI spending next year, up from 66% in 2025. Nearly nine in 10 CEOs said AI is already helping their organizations navigate disruption.\n\nAll that spending has raised expectations. More than half of investors said they expect AI initiatives to show results in under six months. CEOs aren't so sure: Only 16% of leaders at large-cap companies — with annual revenue of $10 billion or more — said such fast returns are realistic.\n\nFears that AI will eliminate human jobs have intensified as more companies announce layoffs tied to automation.\n\nHP said in a November earnings report that it plans to eliminate between 4,000 and 6,000 roles by the end of 2028 — a move expected to save about $1 billion. IBM announced in November that it would reduce its workforce by a \"single-digit percentage\" in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nBut the shift isn't as simple as workers being replaced by machines. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told CNN in October that the company is simultaneously shifting head count toward AI and quantum computing, and plans to ramp up hiring of college graduates in the next year. AI adoption has also driven demand for programmers and sales employees, he told The Wall Street Journal in May.\n\nAI has created new job categories as it reshapes old ones. Titles such as decision designer and AI experience officer are emerging in the workforce, workplace experts said in a Business Insider report earlier this month. These roles focus on guiding AI systems and enhancing human-AI collaboration.",

    "description": "Halftime stumbles reveal Rockets' resilience. These third-quarter tests forge a stronger team, building crucial late-game composure and earning crucial April skills.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets have a third-quarter problem. Not every night, not in the same way, but often enough that it’s become part of the rhythm of their games. Leads shrink. Momentum swings. Opponents find life. And suddenly a game that felt controlled turns into something that has to be earned again.\n\nAnd here’s the thing — that’s not all bad.\n\nYoung teams usually fall apart early or late. They come out flat or panic in the fourth. Houston doesn’t do that. Their issue tends to show up right after halftime, when adjustments get made and the game asks a slightly different question. That’s a much better problem to have.\n\nThird quarters are where discipline gets tested. The game resets. The adrenaline dips. Coaches counter. This is where teams that rely on feel get exposed, and teams that rely on structure have to prove it. Houston is still learning how to answer that moment consistently, and that learning curve is showing up in real time.\n\nSometimes it’s shot selection. Sometimes it’s pace. Sometimes the defense gets a little too aggressive and loses its shape. But what matters is what happens after. The Rockets don’t spiral. They don’t unravel. They regroup.\n\nThat’s the part people gloss over.\n\nThis team has become one of the better closing groups in the league not because they never make mistakes, but because they respond to them. Third-quarter lapses force them to lock back in. They force communication. They force leadership moments. Those are reps you don’t get when everything goes smoothly.\n\nAnd over time, those reps matter more than clean box scores.\n\nIme Udoka has clearly allowed these moments to breathe instead of overcorrecting them. There’s trust baked into that. Trust that the group will feel it, adjust, and execute when the game actually needs to be won.\n\nEventually, the third-quarter issues will tighten up. Most teams figure that out with experience. But even now, the Rockets are learning something more valuable: how to steady themselves when control slips.\n\nThat’s not a December skill. That’s an April one.\n\nAnd when the margins shrink later in the season, Houston won’t be surprised by discomfort. They’ve already lived in it — and learned how to come out the other side.",

    "description": "Tracking every incoming and outgoing player from Washington in the transfer portal this cycle",
    "fullText": "This is your place to keep track of everything Husky related in the transfer portal this season. The portal still doesn’t officially open until January 2nd but there are already some Husky players who have announced their intention to enter once available (or that intention has been reported by reputable sources). There won’t be any official offers to players until we hit January 2nd but we’ll include updates from Max Vrooman’s transfer portal rankings with every player in the portal with a tie to Washington in some way.\n\nHusky Players Expected to Enter the Transfer Portal (4)\n\nHarris was a three-star recruit out of powerhouse Bishop Gorman HS in Las Vegas, NV. He committed to Jedd Fisch at Arizona but transferred to Washington when Fisch took the job at UW. As a freshman, Harris played 72 offensive snaps across 9 games to burn his redshirt although nearly half of them were in the Sun Bowl. He finished with 2 catches for 17 yards.\n\nThis year it appeared Harris was passed on the depth chart by freshmen Raiden Vines-Bright, Dezmen Roebuck, and Chris Lawson. He played 5 games and was needed more heavily late in the year due to injuries at the receiver position. Harris’s highlight as a Husky was a 61-yard TD against Purdue.\n\nThank you Husky Nation for everything! It’s always love! 💜 https://t.co/Jvv34PVCWr\n\n— Audric Harris (@audricharris2) December 3, 2025\n\nBryant was a three-star recruit out of St. John Bosco in the class of 2023. Over his first two seasons at Washington he played 64 snaps as a reserve. Opportunity opened up for Bryant as Washington lost almost their entire linebacker corps from 2024 to eligibility or the portal. Bryant stepped up and surprisingly won a starting spot, starting the Huskies’ first 10 games this season.\n\nBut it was clear that the path to playing time would be harder next season with Jacob Manu and Zaydrius Rainey-Sale both back following 2024 ACL tears plus Buddah Al-Uqdah coming back from injury and Xe’ree Alexander playing well down the stretch. There was no way that there would be enough playing time for all 5 next season and so Bryant is the first of the group to depart as the only one of the group not initially signed by the current coaching staff.\n\nFYI: Husky LB Devin Bryant is not with the team in LA. Planning to enter the transfer portal. \n\nAlso, G Geirean Hatchett has been granted a waiver by the NCAA and is planning on returning to UW next year\n\n— Dave “Softy” Mahler (@Softykjr) December 14, 2025\n\nMcCutcheon was a three-star recruit in the class of 2021 having originally committed to Jimmy Lake as the slot corner in Lake’s defense. Lake of course was out by the end of McCutcheon’s freshman year but he stuck around under Kalen DeBoer playing 84 snaps over his 2nd and 3rd seasons in the program. McCutcheon once again stayed at UW when Jedd Fisch came in and in 2024 played 254 snaps as the backup nickel corner. He was seemingly passed on the depth chart by Rahshawn Clark in the preseason though and then suffered a season-ending injury in the first month of the year before playing a snap. He is hoping to earn a medical waiver for 2026 and otherwise would be out of eligibility so his departure doesn’t change UW’s expected scholarship count.\n\nNEW: Washington cornerback Dyson McCutcheon plans to enter the transfer portal, @PeteNakos reports. \n\nThe son of former NFL player Daylon McCutcheon missed the 2025 season but played in 12 games in 2024. He's seeking a sixth year of eligibility.https://t.co/kSYG7dYADj pic.twitter.com/NUWNgFnu3F\n\n— Transfer Portal (@TransferPortal) December 14, 2025\n\nBoyajyan was a three-star recruit out of Clovis, CA in the class of 2024. He signed with Washington as his only P4 offer with Washington looking to replenish an offensive line that had absolutely no depth when Jedd Fisch took over in Seattle. Boyayjyan hadn’t seen the field yet through two seasons and didn’t appear likely to be one of the top 8 linemen for next season barring a huge leap in the offseason.\n\nWashington OL Davit Boyajyan plans to enter the portal.\n\nBoyajyan signed with the Huskies in 2024 out of Clovis (Calif.) North- redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining. https://t.co/kUwKSzhG03 pic.twitter.com/44zbh4JQ1L\n\n— Brandon Huffman (@BrandonHuffman) December 14, 2025\n\nTransfer Portal Rankings Dashboard\n\nYou can access the dashboard here (the spacing is better than the embedded version here).",

    "description": "Philip Rivers fought back tears as he considered what message it would send to his sons, or the young men he has coached, that he nearly led the Indianapolis Colts to victory at age 44.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers fought back tears as he considered what message it would send to his sons, or the young men he has coached, that he nearly led the Indianapolis Colts to victory at age 44.\n\n“There is doubt, and it’s real,” Rivers said, choking up briefly. “The guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is, ‘Shoot, let’s see what happens.’ I hope in that sense that can be a positive to some young boys, or young people.”\n\nRivers ended a nearly five-year retirement to start Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks and played efficient football for the desperate Colts, who turned to the future Hall of Famer after Daniel Jones was lost for the season with a torn Achilles tendon.\n\nHe threw a touchdown pass in the first half, played mostly mistake-free and moved the Colts into position for Blake Grupe’s 60-yard field goal with 47 seconds left. But Jason Myers responded with a 56-yarder that gave the Seahawks an 18-16 victory.\n\nIt was a remarkable day for a grandfather who’s spent the past few years coaching high school football in his native Alabama.\n\nRivers took a few hard hits from the Seahawks’ stout defense, and he even enjoyed them.\n\n“I never minded that part of it,” Rivers said. “My wife always tells me I’m crazy because there’s been times in the last three or four years I said, ‘I wish I could just throw one and get hit – hard.’”\n\nThis wasn’t a novelty act, as it may have seemed when the Colts signed the Pro Football Hall of Fame semifinalist to their practice squad less than a week ago. Coach Shane Steichen’s Colts, who began the season 7-1 but are trying to stop a second-half collapse, knew what they were getting out of the veteran.\n\nRivers finished 18 of 27 for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception, with the pick coming on his final pass as he tried to force the ball down the field in the closing seconds.\n\n“I was just thankful — grateful — that I was out there,” Rivers said. “And it was a blast — it was a blast — but obviously the emotions now are disappointment. This isn’t about me. We have a team scrapping like crazy to try and stay alive and get into the postseason.”\n\nThe Colts (8-6) have dropped four straight and five of six, and they are outside the AFC playoff picture with three games left. They trail both Jacksonville and Houston in the AFC South.\n\nSteichen called a conservative game, relying on running the ball and controlling the clock. Rivers threw mostly short passes to the outside, checkdowns and screens.\n\n“He went out there and gave us a chance to win it,” Steichen said.\n\nRivers took two sacks, and he showed his age on the first one. He stumbled while evading pressure from Boye Mafe, got up, then fell again.\n\nRivers pumped his right fist and let out a roar after throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to Josh Downs with 1:33 remaining in the first half to put the Colts up 13-3.\n\nIt was Rivers’ first touchdown pass since he threw a 27-yarder to Jack Doyle in the Colts’ 27-24 loss to Buffalo in a wild-card playoff game on Jan. 9, 2021. He also became the fifth player in NFL history to throw a TD pass at age 44 or older, joining Tom Brady, George Blanda, Steve DeBerg and Vinny Testaverde.\n\n“It’s been 1,800 days since I’ve thrown a touchdown — or interception for that matter. So we have both those (boxes) checked,” Rivers said.\n\nRivers was chosen last month as one of 26 semifinalists for the Hall of Fame’s class of 2026 but will now have his eligibility delayed. A player must be out of the league for at least five years before his candidacy can be considered. The earliest Rivers can be a candidate is for the class of 2031.\n\nHe ranks among the top 10 in NFL history in wins, attempts, completions, yards passing, touchdown passes and 300-yard games.\n\nSince his retirement, he’s been coaching at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama, where the team held a watch party on Sunday. Rivers’ players were on his mind as he returned to the NFL.\n\n“Maybe it will inspire or teach not to run or be scared of what may or may not happen,” Rivers said.",

    "description": "The Packers lost to the Broncos on Sunday. Here's what went right, what went wrong and what it means for the Packers moving forward.",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers gave up a 23-14 lead in the second half, lost several key players to injury and limped to the finish line of a 34-26 defeat at the hands of the Denver Broncos on Sunday at Empower Field at Mile High. Matt LaFleur's team had its four-game win streak snapped and is now 9-4-1, but the injuries to Micah Parsons and Christian Watson are the big story coming out of this defeat.\n\nHere's what went right, what went wrong and what it means for the Packers moving forward:\n\n-- Jordan Love was red hot in the first half, completing 17 of 21 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown as the Packers scored on their first four possessions.\n\n-- Josh Jacobs played through a right knee injury and produced 92 total yards and two big scores.\n\n-- Credit Edgerrin Cooper. There was no quit in him. He broke up a fourth down pass and had a tackle for loss on fourth down late in the fourth quarter, keeping the Packers alive. He finished with eight tackles, two for a loss and a pass breakup.\n\n-- The Packers run defense limited the Broncos to 2.9 yards per carry and didn't give up a run over eight yards.\n\n-- First-round pick Matthew Golden drew a pass interference penalty on a scoring drive, had a 27-yard catch, an 18-yard catch and an 11-yard catch converting a third down.\n\n-- Pretty much everything after Jordan Love threw a deep ball to Christian Watson with 12:46 left in the third quarter.\n\n-- The offensive line struggled post-Zach Tom. The passing game flat-lined post-Christian Watson. The defense couldn't rush Bo Nix post-Micah Parsons.\n\n-- The Packers defense gave up 23 completions, 304 passing yards and four touchdowns to Bo Nix, who wasn't sacked, didn't have a turnover and finished with a passer rating of 134.7. The secondary got burnt time and time again in big spots. The pass rush produced only three quarterback hits.\n\n-- The Broncos went 4-for-4 scoring touchdowns in the red zone. The Packers were 1-for-4 and settled for three field goals under 40 yards.\n\n-- Courtland Sutton tortured Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine to the tune of seven catches, 113 yards and one touchdown. The cornerbacks weren't good enough on Sunday.\n\n-- Love turned the ball over twice. On the first, he aggressively attacked downfield in a one-on-one opportunity with Christian Watson. On the second, he threw slightly behind Dontayvion Wicks. Both times, Love gave his receiver a chance to make a play. Neither was a perfect throw, and the Broncos made him pay. Denver scored seven points off two takeaways, Green Bay got only three points off one.\n\n-- The Packers were penalized 10 times for 72 yards. Many were completely avoidable infractions. Rasheed Walker was flagged four times.\n\n-- Given two opportunities with the ball down eight points in the fourth quarter, the Packers turned the ball over on downs on back-to-back possessions. Jordan Love took a sack on fourth down ending the first, and his pressured attempt on 4th-and-15 wasn't close to end the game.\n\n-- Xavier McKinney had three passes defensed, but he had two failed opportunities to make a game-changing interception right before Micah Parsons' noncontact injury.\n\nIt isn't hyperbole to say this defeat -- and everything that factored into it -- is season-altering for the Packers. Not only is Matt LaFleur's team now 9-4-1 and in second place in the NFC North, but losing Christian Watson and Micah Parsons to injuries significantly lowers the Packers' championship potential entering the final three games. In fact, if both are done for the season, the championship potential for Green Bay might be zero. Watson had supercharged the passing game. Parsons was the most important player on the team not named Jordan Love. They are indispensable players. The Packers might only need one more win to get into the postseason, but winning the division just got a lot more challenging, and it's extremely difficult to envision the Packers going on the road and winning three straight games without Watson and Parsons. It sure feels like an ascending team that was becoming title worthy just had the rug pulled out from under it in the most devastating way.\n\nSomehow, the Packers must shake off this loss, recover from a physical, injury-filled afternoon in the altitude in Denver, put together a game plan without several important pieces available and go into Chicago and beat the Bears -- who won on Sunday -- at Soldier Field on Saturday night. If the Packers want to win the NFC North and host a playoff game in January, winning next Saturday is a must. Big stakes involved in the rematch.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Breaking down Packers' 34-26 loss to Broncos: What went right, wrong",

    "description": "The Yankees are a finalist to sign one of the top free agent pitchers.",
    "fullText": "The Yankees never wanted to trade pitcher Michael King. They loved the right-hander when he was a multi-innings, high-leverage reliever at the start of his career and they loved him after he went into their rotation in August 2023.\n\nReluctantly, they had to do it.\n\nThat’s the only way the Padres would sign off on trading star outfielder Juan Soto during the 2023 Winter Meetings. King was the centerpiece of the Padres’ return in a blockbuster deal on Dec. 7, 2023 that sent Soto and center fielder Trent Grisham to New York for King, young pitchers Randy Vasquez, Jhony Brito and Drew Thorpe, and veteran catcher Kyle Higashioka.\n\nTwo years later, King is a free agent and the Yankees would like to get him back even though their loaded with starting pitching.\n\nAccording to the Boston Globe, King is considering signing with the Yankees and two of their AL East rivals, the Red Sox and Orioles. A Rhode Island native and Boston College alum, King has “strong interest” in signing with the Red Sox, MassLive reported.\n\nMLB Trade Rumors ranked King No. 14 on its list of top 50 free agents this offseason and predicted he’s get a four-year contract worth $80 million.\n\nIf the Yankees sign King, he could be in a season-opening rotation that includes All-Star left-hander Max Fried, 2024 AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil and a pair of right-handers who impressed as rookies this past season, Will Warren and Cam Schlitter.\n\nBut with All-Star left-hander Carlos Rodon expected to return from his offseason surgery by late April and former Cy Young winner Gerrit Cole due back from Tommy John surgery in May or June, the Yankees could follow a King signing by dealing one of their starters, perhaps Gil. Also, Clarke Schmidt is expected back late in the season from his Tommy John surgery,\n\nKing, 30, was 5-3 with a 3.44 ERA in 15 starts in an injury-plagued 2025 season with the Padres. He was on the IL from May 25 to Aug. 9 and from Aug. 14 to Sept. 9 with shoulder inflammation.\n\nFor his career, he’s 31-29 with a 3.24 ERA in 16 games, 64 as a starter.\n\nHis best season was 2024 when he was 13-9 with a 2.95 ERA in 31 games, 30 starts, for the Padres.\n\nKing began his career with the Yankees mostly pitching as a multi-inning, high-leverage reliever. From 2019 through 2023, he had a 13-17 record for the Yankees with a 3.38 ERA in 115 games, 19 as a starter.\n\nHere are other recent NJ.com Yankees posts to check out:\n\n-- Yankees add free agent bat for protection if Cody Bellinger moves on\n\n-- Yankees add cancer survivor for bullpen depth\n\n-- Yankees free agent finds new home\n\n-- Yankees fans mad about payroll?

    "title": "Who will Colts start at QB vs 49ers? What Philip Rivers, Shane Steichen said",
    "description": "What Colts coach Shane Steichen and quarterback Philip Rivers said about who will start vs 49ers next week",
    "fullText": "SEATTLE — From the way Shane Steichen and Philip Rivers are talking, it does not sound like there is much question about who the starting quarterback will be when the Colts take the field on ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” against the 49ers.\n\nRivers was clearly limited in Sunday’s 18-16 loss to the Seahawks, completing 18 of 27 passes for just 120 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\nBut the Colts liked the way he managed the game, avoided turnovers and gave Indianapolis a chance to win at the end, although the kickoff unit and the defense weren’t able to hold the lead.\n\n“Very encouraged,” Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said. “There's no question about it. For him to go out there and do what he did after five years off, to have a chance to win it and get a game-winning field goal, close to it, obviously, with 40 seconds left, in a hostile environment, against a tough defense just shows his commitment to coming back.”\n\nIndianapolis decided to roll the dice on a 44-year-old Rivers instead of sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard for several reasons.\n\nRivers’ experience, knowledge of the offense, ability to get the Colts into the right plays and encyclopedic knowledge of what defenses are trying to do gave him the edge over Leonard’s age and athleticism.\n\nLeonard completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards, no touchdowns and an interception in relief of Daniel Jones last week in Jacksonville, but Leonard is dealing with a reported PCL sprain in his right knee, although he was able to practice in full all week long.\n\nThe Colts wanted to see if Rivers could handle the rigors of an NFL game.\n\nFrom what they saw on Sunday, it looks like the 44-year-old can handle it, even being hit after five years away from the NFL.\n\n“I never minded that part of it,” Rivers said. “My wife always tells me I'm crazy because there's been times in the last three or four years I said I wish I could just throw one and get hit hard. She says, that's not normal. … The one where the ball was snapped didn't feel great, but the other ones kind of got me going in the game.”\n\nRivers acknowledged that the offense wasn’t very explosive on Sunday.\n\nBut he also talked like a quarterback who expects to start next week.\n\n“It's going to continue to get better,” Rivers said. “This is obviously the first one, we're talking about three days of practice.”\n\nRivers wasn’t entirely happy with his performance.\n\nOr the offense’s. Indianapolis scored 13 points in the first half, but the Colts were held scoreless in the second half until Blake Grupe’s go-ahead field goal with 47 seconds left, giving Indianapolis a one-point lead that Seattle erased in 25 seconds.\n\n“I'm speaking offensively,” Rivers said. “If I can stay healthy — like, I feel good — it's gonna get better as we go, but the catch in that is we gotta win. Doesn't really matter if it's getting better as we go, we gotta win, or it's going to be over in three weeks. That's the catch.”\n\nRivers was already talking like a quarterback thinking about ways the offense can be better.\n\nThe 44-year-old came back to the Colts in a Hail Mary attempt to get Indianapolis into the playoffs. He wants to see it through.\n\n“Certainly going to quickly turn my attention to the 49ers,” Rivers said. “I know they have a Monday night game (at Lucas Oil Stadium). I never got to experience that, either, in that COVID year. And we're going to scratch and fight and claw. I do know that. Not because I'm here. But I do know that any team I've ever been a part of, not because of me, but I've been a part of, will fight like crazy until they tell us the season is over. So you can guarantee that for the next three weeks.”\n\nJoel A. Erickson and Nathan Brown cover the Colts all season.

    "description": "How did the Saints upset the Panthers in Week 15's final seconds? By leaning on a young quarterback who continues to deliver when it matters most.",
    "fullText": "In dramatic fashion, the New Orleans Saints secured their second straight divisional win, edging the Carolina Panthers 20-17 to complete a season sweep. Now 4-10 on the year, New Orleans oddly finds itself 3-2 within the NFC South – effectively throwing a wrench into the plans of the teams jockeying for position at the top of the division.\n\nHow did they do it? By leaning on a young quarterback who continues to deliver when it matters most, paired with a defense that has fully embraced a bend-but-don’t-break identity — and broken through at the most critical moments.\n\nA lot went right once again for the Saints, but let’s break down this Week 15 statement win by answering four key questions:\n\nSimply put: a lot. The Saints showed resilience, composure, and timely execution en route to their second straight divisional victory – one that continues to complicate things for their rivals. At the center of it all was rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who once again proved capable of rising to the moment. After a relatively slow start — aside from an impressive 17-play, 95-yard touchdown drive — Shough took control in the second half. He completed 15 of 19 passes (excluding a late-game spike) and led the Saints on four consecutive scoring drives, three of which ended in points.\n\nWhat stood out most was his command in long down-and-distance situations. Shough converted seven throws on downs of 10+ yards, nearly adding an eighth on a 17-yard completion to DeVaughn Vele on second-and-18 that left the Saints just a yard short. A quick glance at the third-down numbers tells part of the story as well, with New Orleans converting six of 11 attempts.\n\nIt’s clear that Shough has injected confidence into this offense in moments that felt tight earlier in the season. It wasn’t perfect — nor does it need to be — but with Shough under center, the Saints are winning games, and he’s beginning to look more and more like a legitimate part of the franchise’s future. The defense also deserves significant praise. While far from dominant from start to finish, they came up with their biggest plays when it mattered most. Early in the fourth quarter, trailing by seven with Carolina driving, the Saints defense delivered a massive fourth-and-one stop, preventing the Panthers from extending their lead to double digits.\n\nTwo drives later, after forcing a three-and-out, defensive end Chase Young made perhaps the play of the game – sacking Bryce Young on first-and-10 after Carolina had just converted a critical third-and-long with under two minutes remaining. The sack swung momentum, forced a punt, and set the stage for the Saints’ game-winning drive. And finally, credit where it’s due – Charlie Smyth delivered. After connecting on a 42-yard field goal earlier, the rookie kicker calmly drilled a 47-yard game-winner with two seconds remaining, the first walk-off kick of his young career. Moments like that can define confidence for a young specialist.The vibes were as high as they’ve been in New Orleans all season.\n\nDespite the strong finish, the Saints once again struggled out of the gate offensively. Two early drives – a 3-play, 4-yard and 6-play, 17-yard drive drained early momentum from a crowd eager for a fast start. While the offense responded in the second half, slow starts like this can be costly against more complete opponents.\n\nThe defense faced similar issues early. Carolina scored on three of its first four possessions, consistently moving the ball on the ground and extending drives on third down. Credit the unit for tightening up after halftime, but the early lapses mirrored what we saw against Miami a few weeks ago – the difference this time was finishing the job.Faster starts on both sides of the ball would allow this team to build separation rather than fighting until the final whistle.\n\nThe Saints have officially made things interesting. With a rookie quarterback leading the way, New Orleans has rattled off back-to-back wins after once being projected to pick inside the top 3-5 of next year’s draft – with major questions still looming at quarterback. That narrative is starting to shift. If this upward trend continues, the Saints may pivot from searching for a quarterback to aggressively building around one. How they close out the final three games will go a long way in shaping the organization’s offseason approach.\n\nNext Sunday, the Saints return home to host the New York Jets – a matchup with real implications for draft positioning at the top of the board. That said, based on recent play, this is another winnable game for New Orleans and an opportunity to secure a third straight victory.\n\nFinishing the season strong may be the most important objective for this team moving forward. With a young quarterback instilling confidence across the roster, momentum matters — not just for the locker room, but for the veterans already in place and the free agents the organization will evaluate come March.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Instant analysis: What went right, what went wrong in Saints-Panthers",

    "fullText": "The Patriots entered Sunday 11-2 with a chance to clinch the AFC East with a win.\n\nThey started the game against the Bills looking like they’d have a great chance to do just that, going up 21-0 and taking a 24-7 lead into halftime.\n\nBut then things fell apart in the second half, with Buffalo going on to win 35-31.\n\n“I mean, we weren’t able to get any stops,” head coach Mike Vrabel said postgame, via transcript from the team. “When we had an opportunity to make a play, we weren’t able to make it. Penalties. And that’s how this game goes. A few small plays make the difference. We were very prepared for this team to — we were going to need 60 minutes to beat this team.\n\n“This is a good football team. We had a lot of good football in there. And we had a lot of plays that, a few plays we’d like to have back that we’ll have to learn from.”\n\nQuarterback Josh Allen specifically made plenty of second-half plays — which was no surprise from the reigning MVP. He finished the contest 19-of-28 passing for 193 yards with three touchdowns and no picks. He added 48 yards on the ground via 11 carries.\n\n“He’s 6’5″, 250 pounds, runs fast, hard to tackle, hard to get down on the ground. He has an accurate, strong arm. I’m giving you a dissertation on a league MVP,” Vrabel said. “Just watch all the games and know that it’s the same as it was last week. Had a guy free. Weren’t able to make the play. Last week’s team had a guy free, we weren’t able to make a play. That’s why they drafted him and that’s why they pay him 60 million dollars.\n\n“I don’t know what to tell you. Just exactly what we knew what it was going to be, that we were going to need to get a stop or be able to tackle and if we pressured and we came free — so hopefully we get another opportunity to do that. But that won’t be for, I don’t know, but whenever we do… We’ll have to be ready for the quarterback that we have this week.”\n\nThe Patriots will be on the road to face quarterback Lamar Jackson and the Ravens before facing the Jets on the road and the Dolphins at home to cap the 2025 regular season.",

    "fullText": "Broncos may have some significant injury concerns coming out of win over Packers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos were victorious over one of the best teams in the NFC on Sunday. They clinched a playoff berth and saw the Kansas City Chiefs officially eliminated from playoff contention. It was a good day to be a Broncos fan. But good news often comes with some bad news.\n\nDuring the 34-26 win over the Packers, the Broncos saw starting safety Brandon Jones and running back RJ Harvey leave the game with injuries. These would be considered significant losses if these players miss any time, and it seems as though that could happen.\n\nStarting with Jones, who has been nothing short of terrific for the Broncos, he left the game with a chest injury, which is also being reported as a pectoral injury. P.J. Locke stepped in for him, but Locke is a considerable downgrade from Jones.\n\nThe combination of Jones and Talanoa Hufanga at safety has been one of the main reasons the Broncos' defense has been what it is this season. Locke has plenty of playing experience, but he lacks the physicality and overall athleticism that Jones brings to the lineup.\n\nAs for Harvey, he left the game late, after scoring his 10th touchdown of the season, with what was called a rib injury by sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson. That is concerning mainly because the Broncos are already thin at running back following the loss of J.K. Dobbins a few weeks ago.\n\nNot having Harvey available would force the Broncos into a tight spot. The only other running backs on the 53-man roster are Tyler Badie and Jaleel McLaughlin. Neither of them is an every-down back. The team recently signed Sincere McCormick to the practice squad, so he could get a look as well.\n\nREAD:Broncos' Christmas night showdown vs. Chiefs has become easier, less interesting\n\nBoth of these players missing any length of time would be a tough blow for the Broncos to deal with at this stage of the season.

The biggest issue was the subpar performance from junior outside hitter Torrey Stafford, who hit .132 with nine kills and four attacking errors — the Longhorns needed more from their star, outshone on her home court by Badgers standout Mimi Colyer notching a match-high 23 kills on a .309 hitting percentage.\n\nThe young Texas team struggled to find answers across the board as head coach Jerritt Elliott tried to find sparks from his bench, a failed effort.\n\nIn the first set, both teams came out swinging and stayed neck to neck attacking the net at 5-5. True freshman outside hitter Abby Vander Wal aided the Longhorns with four kills during the set, alongside fellow true freshman outside hitter Cari Spears landing three kills in the first set. Texas was able to gain a small lead as Wisconsin continued to capitalize on attacks and force errors to gain a 23-17 lead. Longhorn middle blocker Nya Bunton snagged a two kills for Texas as the match closed out with Wisconsin taking the opening set, 25-22, despite the Longhorns saving five set points.\n\nIn the second set, Wisconsin jumped out to an early 4-2 lead with Colyer snagging early kills. The Longhorns cut the lead to 11-10 by forcing attacking errors, but the Badgers stayed steady, maintaining their lead with outside hitter Grace Egan swinging strong at the net to extending the lead to 18-13. The Longhorns stayed in the match with the leadership of senior outside hitter Whitney Lauenstein tagging four late kills, but the Badges closed the second set, 25-21, having never trailed in it.\n\nAll gas in the intense third set with both teams pumping attack after attack with the Longhorns taking a 8-7 lead. While both teams stayed on each others heel’s by countering each other’s attacks until Longhorn setter Rella Binney served back-to-back aces to put Texas up 15-12. The Longhorns stood strong at the net, forcing Badger errors to close the third set, 25-20, to prolong the match, albeit only briefly.\n\nIn the fourth set, the Longhorns use the momentum from the third set and go on a 4-0 run with kills from Vander Wal and Spears. The Badgers did not lay down as they were able to for errors and counter attack with the aid of outside hitter Una Vajagic to go on a 12-4 run, putting Wisconsin up, 12-8. The Longhorns managed a 4-0 run while libero Ramsey Gary landed an ace bring the match to 18-15, but the Badgers eventually closed the fourth and final set by forcing seven Longhorn errors to end the match, 25-19.",

    "fullText": "Bayern hosted Hamburger SV for the first time in 13 years in the Frauen-Bundesliga. HSV was promoted to the top division this season, but has struggled in this campaign — with only one win twelve matches so far.\n\nIt took Bayern more than a quarter hour to get on the scoresheet, but Germany captain Giulia Gwinn opened the scoring with a beautiful goal. In the 28th minute, Bayern captain Georgia Stanway earned a penalty and stepped up to take it herself. She buried it to make it 2-0. Shortly before halftime, Klara Bühl ran onto a rebounded ball in the box and slotted it low and strong into the back of the net. Bayern was cruising at halftime, up 3-0.\n\nThey did not wait too long to get back to scoring after the break. In the 48th minute, Gwinn played a ball into the box, looking for Pernille Harder, but a HSV defender headed it into the back of the net. The own goal put the hosts up 4-0. Harder would have to wait until the 64th minute, but she finally got her goal to make it 5-0. The final goal came in the 86th minute, when Lea Schüller fired home beautiful header after a Bayern freekick to make it 6-0.\n\nBayern had five different goal scorers — plus the own goal in their dominant performance. They remain at the top of the table with 37 points — six points ahead of second place Wolfsburg. They will host Norwegian side Valerenga in the Champions League play before finishing the calendar year with a trip to Leverkusen for a league match. In March Hamburg will host Bayern in the next round of the DFB-Pokal Frauen.",

    "description": "The former BYU quarterback was a late transfer from BYU to Tulane, but things worked out — for BYU and for Retzlaff.",
    "fullText": "Long before BYU knew it was out of the College Football Playoff, Jake Retzlaff was already in. As a result of Tulane’s 34-21 victory over North Texas on Dec. 5 in the American Conference championship game, the Green Wave, led by the former Cougar quarterback, clinched a spot in college football’s ultimate contest.\n\nRetzlaff and No. 11 Tulane play at No. 6 Ole Miss on Saturday (1:30 p.m., TNT) in a rematch of their Sept. 20 game that didn’t go so well for the Green Wave. The Rebels limited Retzlaff to 56 yards passing and 51 yards rushing in a 45-10 victory.\n\n“I’m excited. It’s going to be a great opportunity, especially considering we didn’t even get off the plane when we played those guys the first time,” Retzlaff said. “This is a chance to make a statement on a national spotlight.”\n\nLast summer, Retzlaff was in the national spotlight for a different reason. A woman filed a civil lawsuit accusing the quarterback of sexual assault. The case was dismissed but a looming multiple-game suspension related to BYU’s honor code led Retzlaff to look elsewhere for his senior season.\n\nDisappointed, but determined, Retzlaff quietly slipped out of town.\n\n“I’ve had some really good guidance over my career — people telling me to go out the right way and stay connected to so many people that are important to me,” he said. “There are a lot of special people at BYU who are family to me, especially in that locker room.\n\n“I could probably say a lot about how or why I left, but Cougar Nation has been so great to me. I don’t feel the need to tear anyone else down. There are too many guys I care about there to say anything bad about that program.”\n\nAs Retzlaff drove away from the BYU campus last summer, his mind was full of questions. The place he had grown to love was in his rear-view mirror with an open road of uncertainty in front of him.\n\n“I knew that wherever I went, if there was an opportunity to play, that I’d have a chance to succeed,” he said. “When I found out it was Tulane, I knew we had a great chance to be that G5 team to break into the playoff.”\n\nWith no guarantee of playing time, Retzlaff had to win the starting job during fall camp and win over the team while he was doing it. As for getting the playbook down, for that he relied on his BYU experience.\n\n“I learned a lot about football from A-Rod (Aaron Roderick), Matt Mitchell, Fesi (Sitake), Harvey (Unga), TJ Woods. I learned a lot from those guys,” Retzlaff said of his former staff at BYU. “So, a lot of it was just translating the verbiage. I had already done a lot of these things before.”\n\nAfter being named Tulane’s starter, Retzlaff led the Green Wave to victories against Northwestern (23-3), South Alabama (33-31) and eventual ACC champion Duke (34-27) before running into Ole Miss. He followed the loss with another trio of wins against Tulsa (31-14), East Carolina (26-19) and Army (24-17).\n\n“This team came together like glue throughout the season,” Retzlaff said. “Truthfully, I didn’t know how it would go with me being so new and trying to get to know the guys. We have grown a lot.”\n\nFlying high at 6-1 and just outside the top 25, Tulane took a road trip to face UTSA on Oct. 30 in San Antonio. Retzlaff knew he missed BYU, but he didn’t realize how much until Tulane’s team bus pulled up to the Alamodome.\n\nDue to his untimely departure, Retzlaff never had a “last game” experience at LaVell Edwards Stadium. There was no senior walk or final hurrah in front of the home fans. But he did have the Alamo Bowl.\n\n“The emotions that came to me when I walked into that building were the exact same feelings I had when I walked in with BYU,” he said. “I went over to the locker where I had sat at — it was surreal.”\n\nIn what had to seem like only days before, Retzlaff’s mind raced back to Dec. 28 when his underdog Cougars lit up No. 23 Colorado 36-14. Not only did the victory push BYU (11-2) up to No. 13 in the final AP Top 25, but an Alamo Bowl record 7,996,679 television viewers watched them do it.\n\nThe win catapulted the Cougars into an optimistic offseason and spring practice, fused by the kind of momentum that fuels a contender for the following year. But it wasn’t to be. At least not in the way Retzlaff had thought — and certainly not in a green and white uniform.\n\n“It was an emotional experience going back to the Alamo Bowl. It just goes to show how I feel about my time at BYU,” he said. “I’m so grateful for my experience and it’s something nobody can take away from me.”\n\nUTSA hammered Tulane 48-26. Retzlaff and the Green Wave responded by winning the next five games to crack into the top 25 and reach the program’s first College Football Playoff. Throughout all of it, he has kept a close eye on his former team.\n\n“They have been so fun to watch. Every time they were on, I was glued to the television,” he said. “Boy, has that little kid, LJ Martin, grown up and become something.”\n\nMartin rushed for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns during BYU’s 11-2 regular season and was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year.\n\n“One of our first interactions on the field was during a player-run-practice before our first seasons,” Retzlaff said. “I was getting mad at him because he screwed up a play. It is literally his first day on the field, but that never changed our relationship.”\n\nWith Retzlaff’s departure, BYU turned the offense over to true freshman Bear Bachmeier who earned the Big 12’s Freshman Offensive Player of the Year.\n\n“Me and Bear have a good relationship,” Retzlaff said. “I texted him once or twice during the season.”\n\nJust as Retzlaff transformed Tulane, Bachmeier led the Cougars to the program’s first Big 12 championship game and a date in the Pop-Tarts Bowl against No. 22 Georgia Tech on Dec. 27 (1:30 p.m., ABC).\n\nRetzlaff’s 2025 stats at Tulane are comparable to what he did last season at BYU. He threw for 2,947 yards and 20 touchdowns for the Cougars, and he is up to 2,862 yards passing and 14 touchdowns for the Green Wave. Retzlaff reduced his interceptions from 12 to 6 and increased his touchdown runs from 6 to 16.\n\n“The biggest and hardest thing was getting that chemistry with the guys,” he said. “I’ve run the ball super effectively this year and learning to command a new offense has been fun.”\n\nMost of all, Retzlaff continues to win. Over the last two seasons at BYU and Tulane, he is 22-4 as a starter with a win in a bowl game and an upcoming date in the playoffs.\n\n“Doing it as a team. That might be a boring answer, but that’s the truthful answer,” said Retzlaff about his successes. “I’ve also been lucky. I’ve had some great defensive teams to play with, some great coordinators and coaches. The way it works is the team has to come together as one with no one out there being selfish.”\n\nThese are good days for Retzlaff. After winning the American Championship, ABC cameras followed him parading around Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in New Orleans as if he had been riding the Green Wave his entire life.\n\nAlong the way, Retzlaff stopped and pulled a young lady from the stands — his longtime girlfriend Jaelynn Lambert, a senior on the BYU softball team. She has been there for him through his wild ride and this spring, Retzlaff vows to be back at Gail Miller Field — for her.\n\nAlso noticeable on championship night was his mustache.\n\n“I decided to give it a shot, why not? It’s been working for me,” he joked. “I added it in the middle of the season. It was a process to get it to where it is now.”\n\nThe same can be said for Retzlaff himself. It has been a process to get to where he is now. He’s been up, down and in between — and always imperfect. Humbled by his mistakes and motivated by redemption, Retzlaff remains a BYU story even as he marches Tulane into the College Football Playoff.\n\nDave McCann is a sportswriter and columnist for the Deseret News and is a play-by-play announcer and show host for BYUtv/ESPN+.

    "title": "Quinn Hughes ‘Extremely Open-Minded’ About Future With Wild After First Night In Minnesota",
    "description": "Hughes arrives in Minnesota, impressing immediately with his calm demeanor and on-ice performance, fueling excitement for his future with the Wild.",
    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn - Quinn Hughes has been in Minnesota for about a day. He came in on a flight last night with Wild General Manager and President of Hockey Operations Bill Guerin and Assistant General Manager Chris Kelleher.\n\n\"Yeah, he’s a funny guy,\" Hughes said about Guerin and his flight. \"Obviously, a tremendous career, and I really appreciate him trading the assets that he did to get me. Some teams, they’re in until they hear what they have to trade to get me, but Billy was just full in. I think that was his first offer. So, obviously I want to do what I can here and prove him right. How he handled me with the 4 Nations last year, too, gave me a glimpse of what a good person he is. And, honestly, he was a big reason why I wanted to come here.\"\n\nHis comfort level stood out immediately. The way he carried himself after the game was incredible. He was calm, confident, and thoughtful. It made it feel less like he had just arrived and more like he had been part of the organization for years.\n\nThat ease carried over onto the ice.\n\nHe played his first game with the Wild on Sunday night amid a raucous home crowd that made its presence felt long before the puck dropped.\n\nWarmups brought a noticeable buzz. Each touch of the puck drew a reaction from the 18,322 in attendance. The response from the stands was immediate, and so was Hughes’ awareness of it.\n\n\"It was pretty special honestly,\" he said. \"I wasn’t expecting that. But that was very cool. I know it’s a hockey market but that was exciting.\"\n\nThe Roar Said Everything: Wild Fans Welcome Quinn Hughes From roaring ovations to custom jerseys, Minnesota Wild fans declared their support for new defenseman Quinn Hughes.\n\nFor a player of Hughes’ stature — a Norris Trophy winner, a franchise defenseman, and one of the NHL’s premier puck-movers in the league, first impressions matter. Minnesota, in a span of hours, made one.\n\nMinnesota toppled the Boston Bruins on Sunday for Hughes' debut by beating them 6-2. Hughes scored a goal and was the first star of the night even though both Kirill Kaprizov and Ryan Hartman had three points.\n\nHeck, Kaprizov tied Mikko Koivu for second all-time in goals and the media still selected Hughes as the first star.\n\n“The first thing is just the players and the guys in the room. Just getting a glimpse, obviously I met everyone four hours ago. Just how great the room has been and welcoming and obviously on the ice today just some of the elite talent they have,\" Hughes said on what excites him most about the Wild.\n\n\"Kirill gave me a pass in the second. I just wasn’t ready for it, and I would have had an open net. But as time goes on here, I start to read off him he starts to read off me. I think it’s going to take four, five, six games. But once we get rolling, I think we’re going to be hard to beat.”\n\nthe smile speaks for itself 😃 pic.twitter.com/GincKFeZ6E\n\n— Minnesota Wild (@mnwild) December 15, 2025\n\nHughes, 26, was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in 2018. He had been with them since but knew his time there could be coming to an end recently. His agent Pat Brisson and Canucks President of Hockey Operations Jim Rutherford worked on a list of places that Hughes would fit well in.\n\n\"Yeah, honestly, I don’t know how much I’m allowed to say, but the ultimate respect for Jim Rutherford and Francesco Aquilini and the Aquilini Family. They were first class with everything that was going on. Obviously, it was a tough situation, but it felt like it was time. And I think Jim did too. But Jim and Pat, very lucky to have him. They were kind of talking a lot about places I might feel comfortable. And Jim was amazing with that. He cared about the person. He wanted me to go where he thought I’d be happy.\"\n\nIn the third period, Brock Faber made a play in the neutral zone to send the puck up the gut. Nicolas Aube-Kubel once touched passed it to Ryan Hartman who skated in and dropped it off for Hughes who scored his first goal with the Wild.\n\nWELCOME TO QUINNESOTA pic.twitter.com/fqO9796iVC\n\n— Minnesota Wild (@mnwild) December 15, 2025\n\nIt was the loudest I have ever heard the arena when he scored and when they announced his goal call. The State of Hockey is so pumped to have a superstar like Hughes and Sunday night showed why.\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely, warm-ups I think was the loudest I’ve ever heard it since I’ve played here,\" Faber said. \"Obviously, everyone’s excited. The State of Minnesota is excited to get a player and person of that caliber, it doesn’t happen often that a guy like that gets moved, so it was really cool and it’s going to be a lot of fun to watch for our fans.\"\n\nBut this really doesn't all happen without the Wild's management and Hughes spoke so glowingly of them, but especially Guerin.\n\nThe hockey fit was important, obviously, but the people fit may have mattered just as much to Hughes and to the Wild.\n\nHughes spent time with Wild general manager Bill Guerin during the flight to Minnesota, and that interaction left an impression that extended far beyond small talk.\n\nMeatballs, Latex Gloves, And A Franchise Defenseman: Inside The Wild's Blockbuster Trade For Quinn Hughes A kitchen, meatballs, and latex gloves. That's where the Wild's blockbuster move for franchise defenseman Quinn Hughes ended. The window is now open.\n\nThe superstar defenseman was well aware that other teams were interested in him and sent offers. He was also aware that interest often stops once the real price becomes clear. Guerin didn’t hesitate. He committed and made the deal.\n\nThat matters to players and especially to the elite ones.\n\nHughes didn’t frame the trade purely in transactional terms. He framed it as belief and revealed how much weight he places on how organizations operate behind the scenes.\n\nFor Hughes, this wasn’t just about joining a good roster. It was about joining leadership he respected.\n\n“I just got here, but a big reason why is obviously because I thought they’re a tremendous group, just playing them over the years. Hard to play against, really hard to play against, but got elite skill as well. Obviously, knowing that I was going to be able to play with Faber, Spurgeon, too, two elite players and Brodin and some other guys that are great back there, Bogo. But yeah to play with those guys I knew would be pretty good for me, too.”\n\nIt goes beyond the players though. Everyone knows how close this group of guys are. The core here is tight and all elite. When talking about Matt Boldy, Faber, Kaprizov and so on. Now adding Hughes to the core is dangerous.\n\nAnd he respects the crap out of Guerin for trading the players he did to acquire the star.\n\nSo much so that even the rumors of him wanting to play with his brother in New Jersey or him wanting to be back home in Michigan and signing with Detroit, didn't even sound like they were serious when Hughes talked.\n\nSo how open-minded is he about signing long-term in Minnesota?\n\n“Extremely open-minded. They got an amazing core,\" he said. \"I’ve only been here four hours but getting to know some of the guys and how energetic and positive guys are and then Minnesota being so close to Michigan and just the State of Hockey and the passion here. Just seeing how the fans reacted to me as well in warmups.\"\n\nNothing about Hughes’ first night in Minnesota felt temporary. From the roar during warmups to the trust shown by the front office, the Wild didn’t just acquire a superstar, they made a statement. Hughes hasn’t been here long enough to make promises, but he’s been here long enough to notice who believed in him, who valued him, and what it feels like to be wanted. For Minnesota, that impression may end up mattering just as much as the trade itself, the money itself or any other factor you want to put into it.\n\n\"I got a lot of time for Billy for quote unquote sacking up and making the deal like he did and just how he valued me. There are other teams that probably could have thrown in certain packages like that, too, but at the end of the day they didn’t want to do that or they didn’t want to trade two or three assets from their team. Billy did, so I’ll remember that and that means a lot to me that Billy did that.”\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "Offseason Notes 5",
    "fullText": "With the MLB Winter Meetings heading up all the headlines for the previous week-plus, there has been very little other San Diego Padres news. The rumors, on the other hand, have been running rampant.\n\nIt started with many prominent baseball writers opining that there is no way for the Padres to survive their change of ownership and budget cuts without trading Fernando Tatis Jr. President of baseball operations A.J. Preller did his best to dispel those rumors during his media appearance at the meetings by stating that Tatis was staying put.\n\nThe other prevailing rumor was that the Padres would be converting either Mason Miller or Adrian Morejon from the bullpen to the starting rotation. This was at least a credible rumor as Preller had acknowledged it was being considered in previous statements. He stated on Day 1 of the meetings that idea was largely dismissed.\n\nThe next rumor floated was that members of the bullpen, Miller and Morejon included, are on the trading block in order to bring back starting pitching.\n\nPreller stated that was not part of the plan, as the bullpen is a strength and he was not interested in diluting that advantage.\n\nThe next subject of the rumor mill was Jake Cronenworth, who is considered to be sought after by teams who need a defensively-talented and versatile infielder who is a valuable offensive player.\n\nThe Cronenworth rumor seems to occur every offseason since he was signed to an extension that gives him $12 million annually through 2030. Up ‘til now, Cronenworth continues to be a Padre and is considered a leader on the team.\n\nThe latest rumors involve Miller, Morejon, Jeremiah Estrada, Nick Pivetta and Ramón Laureano all coveted by the New York Mets, and the Padres are actively in discussions to acquire both pitchers and position players from the Mets’ young prospects and major leaguers (mlbtraderumors).\n\nThe Padres seem to have a complete coaching staff now, though the announcements have not been made officially. Many of the new coaches have connections to new manager Craig Stammen.\n\nAfter retaining bench coach Brian Esposito, pitching coach Ruben Niebla, bullpen coach Ben Fritz, first base coach Dave Macias and the two assistant hitting coaches, the Padres named a second bench coach in Randy Knorr. Mike McCoy and Pat O’Sullivan remain as assistant hitting coaches with new hitting coach Steven Souza.\n\nSouza was a special assistant with the Tampa Bay Rays, was a power hitter as a player and seems to reflect the organization shifting its offensive focus to more aggression. Niebla was given a new title as assistant manager as well as pitching coach.\n\nRyan Goins, hired as an infield coach, was an infield specialist and was on Ron Washington’s staff with the Los Angeles Angels before Washington left due to illness. He was named bench coach after the previous bench coach was named interim manager. Goins was considered a glove-first player as a major leaguer.\n\nKevin Plawecki has been with the Padres as a catching coach in the minor leagues and will move into that role with the major league team. He was a catcher in both the minor leagues with the Padres and a back up catcher with the Mets and Boston Red Sox. He retired after the 2024 season and assumed a coaching role with the Padres.\n\nBob Henley, who spent almost his entire baseball career with the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals, has been hired as the new third base coach. He first had the role in 2014-2021 with the Nationals and then went into a player development role. Stammen pitched with the Nationals from 2009-2015 so there is significant familiarity between them.\n\nRHP Misael Tamarez, who was a free agent after the 2025 season, re-signed with the organization on Dec. 4. RHP Evan Fitterer also signed a minor league contract as a free agent on Dec. 8.\n\nFormer Padres closer Suarez joined former starter Dylan Cease in signing a free agent contract and earning a big payday. Suarez is committed to the Atlanta Braves for three years and $45 million in a setup/ backup closer role.\n\nPadres to the World Baseball Classic\n\nFernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado will be managed by Albert Pujols with the Dominican Republic team. Shortstop Xander Bogaerts will play for the Netherlands team as a native of Aruba. There is a report that Nick Pivetta is considering committing to the Canadian team.\n\nLuis Campusano finishes in winter ball\n\nA.J. Preller stated at the winter meetings that Campusano has finished his time with Tigers de Licey in the Dominican Winter League. He finished with 19 games played and 50 at-bats. His batting line was .200/.293/.340 with a .633 OPS. He had two homers and eight RBI.\n\nPreller has had multiple questions asked regarding Campusano’s future with the team. He will be given another opportunity this spring to show that he belongs on the major league roster. If he is not successful there are no more options for him to be sent to the minors. The options will be to trade him or try to pass him through waivers in order to be optioned.",

    "fullText": "Frankie de la Noche was different from Gus Marlowe and Professor Saber in that he only technically appeared once this season—though his creation was preceded by a detective article that served as a proof of concept. That first noir piece was also the first time I stepped outside my usual voice and wrote in an entirely different style.\n\nUp to that point, my writing had followed a pretty clear progression. My first fan post was a classic Crescibene smackdown of ESPN’s Watchability Index—pure fire, pure indignation, very much in the same voice as my anti-corruption writing on Medium. The next two articles were more traditional baseball analysis, focused on the player pipeline and the GM pipeline within the Cleveland organization. Those pieces were still written in my voice, but structurally they were recognizable as standard sports analysis.\n\nThe detective article broke from all of that. It wasn’t just a tonal shift; it was a structural one. And as far as I’ve been able to tell, no one else is doing sports journalism quite like this.\n\nEarly in the season, after my first few fan posts, I wrote a one-off detective noir piece that explored the Guardians roster as a mystery. At that point, there was no Frankie de la Noche. What I was really doing was experimenting with style—seeing if I could write a roster analysis in a completely different way. Instead of presenting information directly, I treated the roster like a case file. It was a risk, but it worked.\n\nThe response to that article made it clear that style itself could carry meaning, and that a strong narrative voice could make familiar information feel fresh again. At the time, I didn’t know I was laying the groundwork for a recurring character. I just knew it was a style I wanted to return to later.\n\nOnce Gus Marlowe had established himself as a recurring presence, I realized I needed other recurring characters to join him. That’s when the idea of a detective character took shape—a way to return to the noir style, but this time with a defined voice behind it rather than just an experiment in form.\n\nThat’s when Frankie de la Noche was born.\n\nFrankie is the dramatized version of my internal dialogue when I’m trying to make sense of roster construction, call-ups, logjams, and front-office decisions that don’t quite add up. In Frankie’s first true appearance, I introduced him in his office at Progressive Field—a single light glowing beneath a door on the fourth floor, late at night, rain tapping against the windows. It was a classic noir setting, and a deliberate callback to the original detective article. Noir characters are inseparable from their environments, and I wanted readers to feel like they were stepping into Frankie’s space in an immersive way.\n\nThat said, Frankie is still very much a character in formation. The setting is established. The tone is established. The function is established. But his mannerisms, rhythms, and specific quirks are still emerging. Characters like this aren’t built all at once; they reveal themselves through repetition.\n\nThat was something Gus taught me over the course of the season. His abrupt entrances, clipped phrasing, and chaotic exits weren’t planned in advance—they were discovered over time. They came from seeing him in different situations and letting consistency form naturally. Frankie is now going through that same process of discovery.\n\nFrankie de la Noche will certainly be back as there will be no shortage of roster mysteries next season. I already know there are other settings where Frankie belongs—and yes, there will absolutely be a late-night encounter under a bridge in the Flats. Maybe Frankie has an informant. Maybe someone slips him an inside scoop.\n\nThe goal going forward is the same one I had with Gus: to make Frankie feel immediately recognizable. I want readers to know his voice the moment he starts talking. When Frankie shows up, it should feel like running into someone you’ve met before.\n\nIn review, Frankie de la Noche this season was more of an exploration than a finished product. He emerged out of a stylistic experiment, found a purpose once the cast of characters began to take shape, and made his first real appearance with more potential than polish. And that’s fine. That’s how characters should start. Where it goes from here… only Frankie knows.\n\nSo what do you think? Did the noir pieces work for you? Did Frankie feel like someone worth revisiting? And when the next mystery comes along, would you like to see him take another case?\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.",

    "description": "The NY Giants hold the No.1 pick after their eighth consecutive loss.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants suffered a frustrating 29-21 loss to the Washington Commanders on Sunday as they returned from their bye week. As a result, the Giants continued to hold the No.1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThere were some flashes, like Abdul Carter having a breakout game, big plays from tight ends Daniel Bellinger and Theo Johnson, DB Dru Phillips, and RB Tyrone Tracy. But there were simply too many miscues and missed opportunities to overcome with late magic. But ultimately it was too little, too late for the Giants and their frantic comeback fell short.\n\nThe loss also highlighted the shortcomings of the Giants’ roster, as the receivers consistently failed to get open, once again forcing Jaxson Dart to hold the ball or take a big hit when scrambling, and struggled to hang onto the ball when they did find separation. This was also (probably) Jermaine Eluemunor’s worst game of the season, as he struggled against veteran pass rusher Von Miller, and the Giants struggled to consistently move the ball in short-yardage situations on the ground.\n\nThe Giants’ eighth-consecutive loss comes one day after Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThat brings us to the upside of the loss for the Giants: there are a number of quarterback-needy teams in the Top 10 of the draft, and it’s possible that Mendoza will be the only highly-regarded quarterback to come out this year. That could make the first overall pick highly valuable if teams like the New York Jets, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, and New Orleans Saints are all vying for the top quarterback prospect.\n\nNobody wants to see the Giants lose, but trading the first overall pick could net valuable assets to fill multiple holes in the first two or three rounds. The Giants could use a highly-drafted receiver as well as a long-term answer at right tackle. Likewise, the Giants need a long-term answer at right guard and an infusion of youth and athleticism at linebacker.\n\nMost early mock drafts have the Giants drafting a wide receiver or an offensive tackle with their first pick. A sizeable haul of picks could allow them to address both positions with high picks, as well as add one of the talented linebackers or defensive backs in this class.\n\nIt remains to be seen who will make that pick, but the Giants could have a tremendous amount of capital to go with a young roster.\n\nThe Giants’ road to the first overall pick is a tight one. They share a 2-12 record with the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders (who they play in two weeks). The Jets, Browns, and Arizona Cardinals are also each a game out of the first pick at 3-11, though the Saints managed to beat the Carolina Panthers and improve to 4-10 on the season.\n\nNew York still has games against the Minnesota Vikings, the afore-mentioned Raiders, and the Dallas Cowboys to end the season. They remain a team that can compete with any in the NFL, as well as lose to any in the NFL, so no outcome between 1st and 10th overall is out of the question.",

The Lions (8-6) haven’t made the postseason in three consecutive campaigns since 1993-95, and understood coming into the weekend that even winning out might not be enough to get a playoff berth and end that streak.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — The Detroit Lions know what it takes to compete with the best in the loaded NFC after a 41-34 loss to the conference-leading Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.\n\nBut with three games and zero margin for error remaining to make the playoffs, the Lions are running out of time to be able to put those lessons to use.\n\n“You know what it is. And we’re not there right now,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said. “Doesn’t know we can’t be, but now we know what it looks like, and you got to get better. We got to get better. We got to move on. Can’t sulk about it. Can’t felly sorry for ourselves. We make the corrections, and we move on.”\n\nThe Lions (8-6) haven’t made the postseason in three consecutive campaigns since 1993-95, and understood coming into the weekend that even winning out might not be enough to get a playoff berth and end that streak.\n\nThey came out with a first half worthy of the Super Bowl aspirations they entered the season with, taking a 24-14 lead with 30 seconds remaining behind a dynamic passing attack from quarterback Jared Goff to wide receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, plus a jaw-dropping interception by edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson on a tight end screen and returning it 58 yards.\n\n“Aidan made a great play,” Los Angeles quarterback Matthew Stafford said. “Looked like he was the primary receiver on the damn play. Made me look silly in space.”\n\nBut the Rams (11-3) snatched a field goal to end the second quarter, and the Lions could not regain momentum after the break, going three-and-out on both possessions in the third quarter while the defense gave up 17 points.\n\nGoff pointed to ineffectiveness on first down in the second half, forcing the offensive line into situations where Los Angeles could turn to its powerful pass rush. Campbell essentially agreed, noting an overall inability to run the ball as Detroit had two carries for 11 yards in the third quarter, plus a holding penalty which negated a first down and left the offense facing third-and-long.\n\n“But, the bottom line is, we weren’t able to convert, and so then we strung the defense out, and then all of a sudden it flips,” Campbell said. “You’re up 10, you’re down 10, and that was a rough quarter for us.”\n\nThe Lions finished with just 70 yards rushing on 20 carries, having failed to win any of their five games this season when totaling less than 100 yards on the ground.\n\nGoff went 25 of 41 for 338 yards and three touchdowns, finding St. Brown 13 times for 164 yards and two scores and Williams seven times for 134 yards and a score, though their overall effectiveness dropped off in the second half.\n\nDetroit needs to win its final three games — against Pittsburgh, at Minnesota on a short week, and at Chicago — and get help to have a shot at the playoffs\n\nGoff expressed belief the Lions can still put a streak together, even after alternating wins and losses for the past 10 games.\n\n“We’re resilient,” Goff said. “I hope I can give you a really good answer in a couple weeks. But we’re resilient. We really are, and I expect us to bounce back from this, and we still have plenty of stuff in front of us.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "We discuss the most important golf figures of the last 12 months, the drama of PGA Tour Q-School, an insane golf record and more.",
    "fullText": "Check in every week for the unfiltered opinions of our writers and editors as they break down the hottest topics in the sport, and join the conversation by tweeting us at @golf_com. This week, we discuss the most important golf figures of the last 12 months, the drama of PGA Tour Q-School and more.\n\nAs we count down the final days of 2025, let’s take a quick moment to reflect on the year that was. Who were the most important golf figures of 2025?\n\nJack Hirsh, associate equipment editor (@JR_HIRSHey): Important? I think it's got to be new PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp and new LPGA commissioner Craig Kessler. Both have taken over legacy properties badly in need of fresh ideas and new perspective. Already we're hearing talks of massive changes for the PGA Tour schedule as soon as 2027. Whether you like them or not, the Tour is clearly looking for something that will put its LIV Golf problem to bed. With Kessler and the LPGA, a new TV deal seems like it could be the spark to get the Tour to ride this new wave of interest in women's sports around the world. There are certainly more important names in the golf world right now, but none will have more pressure to achieve their goals in 2026 than these two.\n\nZephyr Melton, associate game-improvement editor (@zephyrmelton): Jack laid it out well, but I'll go ahead and give Tiger Woods his obligatory mention. The popularity of the sport still ebbs and flows with Tiger - as evidenced by the heaps of coverage when he so much as posts a swing video. His competitive career may be behind him, but his influence on the game remains unmatched.\n\nJosh Sens, senior writer (@JoshSens): Good answers above. To them, I'd add Rory McIlroy for providing the most compelling entertainment of the year at both the Masters and the Ryder Cup. And Tommy Fleetwood for best feel-good story. But that's more about rooting interest than importance. Beyond those guys, some non-traditional golf figures come to mind, especially at a time when the game is stretching increasingly beyond its old boundaries. Caitlin Clark getting into golf. LeBron James going viral with every swing posted online. And though I'd rather get a root canal than watch a bunch of \"influencers\" knock it around, clearly people are interested, as we saw with the success of the Internet Invitational. Welcome to the future, for better or worse.\n\nAnd who - not mentioned above - might we be talking about in this space a year from now as a key figure of 2026?\n\nHirsh: I think it will be someone like Jon Rahm. His prominence in the game has seemed to diminish since his move to LIV, but he’s still played pretty well and I think will start making more of an impact in majors. He still hasn’t won one since the 2023 Masters.\n\nMelton: How bout Brooks Koepka? Speaking of LIV, he's long been rumored to want out of his LIV deal in order to get back to the PGA Tour. Could 2026 be the year we see a LIV star defect back to the Tour? If it is, BK is likely the first domino to fall.\n\nSens: Bryson. His impact shows no sign of slowing.\n\nFive players earned Tour cards for 2026 via PGA Tour Q-School Sunday at TPC Sawgrass. Which outcome - the good or bad - stuck out to you the most?\n\nHirsh: Sad to see one of the Tour's great people, Camilo Villegas, come up one shot short of a playoff to keep full playing status on the Tour. He'll still be around as a former winner, but I wouldn't be surprised if former winners hanging onto fringe status is exactly what shrinking the number of exempt players from 125 to 100 is targeting.\n\nMelton: Alejandro Tosti is headed back to the Tour - and the content gods thank him.\n\nSens: Villegas' final missed shorty on 18 was painful. But it was touching to see him stick around to celebrate with his friend and countryman Marcelo Rozo. Personally, I was rooting for Spencer Levin, who has been around the block and then some and just didn't have his best stuff today.\n\nSpeaking of the Tour’s aforementioned card changes, are five cards from Q-School enough? Too little? And is Q-School still a key part of the Tour’s construction?\n\nHirsh: We absolutely need Q-School, especially now that Monday Qs are gone. I think five is a good number, especially with the Korn Ferry Tour shrinking to 20 cards. I also like the hard five instead of the ties, because a playoff, like we got this year, for the last PGA Tour card of the season is pretty awesome. But I'd also like to use this space to mention we still need Monday Qs.\n\nMelton: I'd like to see Q-School give even more cards. We always talk about \"life-changing\" weeks in pro golf, but there's no tournament where that's more true than the Final Stage of Q-School. The drama of it is unlike anything else in the sport, and that makes it one of the coolest weeks of the year.\n\nSens: Five feels about right. And eliminating ties only adds to the excitement. Nothing like a sudden-death playoff to cap a four-day stress test.\n\nOur Josh Sens recently wrote about a golfer who just broke a world record for most courses played in a year. What’s your number? And if you could pick one course you have already played to tee it up on for the rest of your life, which is it?\n\nHirsh: First of all, that's a level of golf sicko-ness of which I'm not familiar. Bravo! I have no idea what the most courses I've ever played is. Probably around 20. I'm sure Zephyr has played some ungodly number of courses the last couple years. If I had to pick one course though, it would probably be Royal Dornoch. Links golf is undefeated.\n\nMelton: I wish I played half as much golf as my co-workers think I play. I only logged 40 rounds in 2025! As for the most courses, it's likely in the range of 30 or so. When you don't belong to a club, variety is the name of the game. As for one course for the rest of my life? Give me Pasatiempo. Elite course. Elite vibe. Elite logo.\n\nSens: I'd only be guessing at an annual number. Probably 50? That was a year in my 20s when I waited tables at night and would sneak out to the muni pre-weekday shifts. As for a single course, tough question. In the absence of a perfect answer: Cruden Bay. I don't think I've ever had more fun on a course.\n\nThe post Tour Confidential: The most important golf figures of 2025 appeared first on Golf.",

Their only dropped set came in the Round of 32 against UCLA. Outside of that brief hiccup, Kentucky has controlled matches from start to finish and remains undefeated at home this season.\n\nWisconsin arrives in Kansas City after a statement win over No. 1 Texas in the Elite Eight. The Badgers earned a measure of revenge against the Longhorns, who handed Wisconsin one of its four losses during the regular season. Kentucky accounted for Texas’ other two defeats, beating the Longhorns in both the regular season and the SEC Tournament championship.\n\nThursday’s matchup also carries historical weight for Big Blue Nation. Wisconsin was the team that ended Kentucky men’s basketball’s perfect 38–0 season in the 2015 Final Four, denying the Wildcats an undefeated national title.\n\nNow, Kentucky volleyball has an opportunity to write a different ending against the Badgers on the sport’s biggest stage.\n\nIf the Wildcats advance, they’ll face the winner of the other national semifinal matchup, which sees No. 1 seed Pittsburgh, who actually handed Kentucky one of its regular-season losses, take on No. 3 seed Texas A&M, whom the Cats defeated in College Station.\n\nWith a spot in the national championship match on the line, the Wildcats will look to continue their dominant run and settle an old score. The national championship game is Sunday, Dec. 21, on ABC at 3:30 PM ET.\n\nThe semifinal is set. \n\nvs. Wisconsin on Thursday, 9:00 p.m. ET at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City😼\n\nTickets: https://t.co/sv5Hlwlsn1#WeAreUK x #BBN pic.twitter.com/BxN8vh57w8\n\n— Kentucky Volleyball (@KentuckyVB) December 15, 2025",

    "fullText": "Cowboys vs. Vikings live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch the NFL game tonight\n\nEntering the final quarter of the NFL season, it’s officially do-or-die for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSitting at a precarious 6-6-1 after a damaging Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Cowboys are clinging to life in the NFC playoff picture. The road to the NFC East crown has become a steep uphill climb, with the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles holding a significant advantage at 8-5. For Dallas, the margin for error has evaporated; it can no longer afford the inconsistent performances that have defined its season.\n\nWith the NFC wild-card race stacked — featuring contenders like the Lions, Panthers and Buccaneers — the Cowboys need a near-perfect run to separate themselves. Their remaining schedule features three of four games against NFC opponents with playoff implications. The crucible begins immediately in Week 15 with a pivotal home Sunday Night Football clash against the Minnesota Vikings (5-8).\n\nWhile Minnesota will almost certainly miss the playoffs, it provides a tough matchup for Dallas. The Vikings' defense is coming off a game where it shut out the Commanders, forcing three turnovers and giving up just over 200 yards in a 31-0 win. Offensively, while J.J. McCarthy has had his struggles in his first year as a starter, the Vikings still have plenty of weapons to boats, including a top wide receiver duo in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison; with these two, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, the receiving talent is off the charts.\n\nDallas needs a home primetime win to keep its playoff aspirations alive, while Minnesota is looking to build on the momentum it generated last week.\n\nFollow along for all the action from AT&T Stadium.\n\nSTREAM: Watch Vikings vs. Cowboys LIVE with Peacock\n\nNFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\n10:42 p.m.: Williams is back with two big carries.

    "fullText": "The Cowboys received mixed news as the second half started. Javonte Williams was back (and did well on his first carry), but Hunter Luepke was ruled out with a concussion. It was noted that the injury occurred on the final kickoff to end the first half.\n\nLuke Schoonmaker (really) had an amazing catch that put the Cowboys at the Minnesota 11-yard line. A play later it appeared that CeeDee Lamb was interfered with in the end zone, but nothing was called.\n\nUnfortunately the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal which felt like a failure. Still, points are points.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 20, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 26-yard field goal)\n\nThis will sound shocking, but it is true. The Dallas Cowboys defense pitched a three and out on their next drive. It was a Christmas miracle.\n\nDallas tried to get KaVontae Turpin involved on offense on the next possession, a curious move given that George Pickens had not really had many moments at this point in the game. But hey, whatever.\n\nThings stalled out yet again and Brandon Aubrey delivered once more.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 41-yard field goal)\n\nRight off the bat the Vikings were across midfield. Playing with your food has consequences.\n\nNot long after that the Vikings were up against the goal line. Keep in mind before you reed the next sentence that the previous Cowboys four possessions ended with a field goal kick (they missed one obviously).\n\nBoom. Vikings touchdown.

They moved thoroughly down the field and kept getting in their own way to keep themselves from scoring a touchdown. They wound up with a short situation right on the goal line and then J.J. McCarthy pulled the Peyton Manning bootleg.\n\nEmbarrassing pic.twitter.com/AJugDLlRaS\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 14 (J.J. McCarthy touchdown)\n\nThe game was tied at this point which felt weird because it had for so long felt like Dallas was in control. The Cowboys nevertheless began moving once more and ultimately stalled out in field goal range. Brandon Aubrey, though.\n\nUnfortunately Aubrey pushed his 51-yard attempt wide to the right which kept things tied and gave the Vikings solid field position to work with.\n\nMinnesota was able to scrap out a field goal which gave them their first lead of the night. It set Dallas up with a chance to score and 1:48 to do so. Given that Dallas deferred to start the game the drive also offered a potential double-dip opportunity.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 17 (Will Reichard 29-yard field goal)\n\nThe Cowboys were able to work quickly to get in field goal range themselves. Given Aubrey’s recent miss there was a little bit of breath holding for the first time in a while with him.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 17, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 17-yard field goal)\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys won the toss and deferred which put the defense on the field first. Given that there were reports about how Logan Wilson was set to start at linebacker… it was exciting to say the least.\n\nIt took two plays for things to get legitimately exciting. Donovan Wilson got pressure in J.J. McCarthy’s face and wisely put his hand up to block a pass. That errant ball landed in the expectant arms of Quinnen Williams to give the Cowboys a turnover and more importantly… the ball!\n\nQUINNEN WILLIAMS INT! pic.twitter.com/ImWT83EQCu\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAfter a couple of plays the Cowboys appeared to stall out and had to settle for a Brandon Aubrey field goal. They didn’t, though! They ran a fake! And got it!\n\nBRANDON AUBREY WITH THE WHEELS pic.twitter.com/GGGBuE5B1i\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAmazingly the Cowboys got down to another fourth down and went for it yet again, although this time conventionally by way of a Javonte Williams run.\n\nAfter getting it Javonte was in the end zone one play later.\n\nJAVONTE TD! pic.twitter.com/3ObBLpnpmW\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 0 (Javonte Williams touchdown)\n\nThe Cowboys defense went to work and while they were not able to generate a turnover they did force a punt. Dante Fowler was a particular point of pride on the possession in question and helped stop Aaron Jones.\n\nUnfortunately KaVontae Turpin let a punt go that he maybe should have fielded. The bounce really worked against Dallas and put them just about on their own goal line.\n\nMalik Davis was in at running back for the possession as it was reported that Javonte Williams was dealing with a shoulder injury. Ultimately the Cowboys wound up punting after a three and out as they did not want to get too cute.\n\nIt took two plays once more for Minnesota to have a moment. On the first one of them Aaron Jones had a massive gain and a penalty added to it to make matters worse. A few seconds later J.J. McCarthy hit Jalen Nailor for a game-tying touchdown.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 7 (J.J. McCathy to Jalen Nailor touchdown)\n\nWhen the Cowboys took over it was noted by the NBC broadcast that Javonte Williams was questionable to return with a shoulder injury so that corroborated everything to date.\n\nDak Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for a huge gain and the Cowboys were in striking distance as the opening quarter came to a close. To help matters a facemask penalty really put Dallas close to another score.",

    "fullText": "SEATTLE (AP) — Noah Ostlund, Tage Thompson and Zach Benson all scored and the Buffalo Sabres beat the Seattle Kraken 3-1 on Sunday for their third straight win.\n\nAlex Tuch had two assists and Alex Lyon made 23 saves for the Sabres.\n\nChandler Stephenson scored for Seattle, and Joey Daccord stopped 20 shots. The Kraken have lost eight of their last nine games (1-7-1).\n\nOstlund opened the scoring on a 2-on-1 alongside Josh Norris with 2:51 to go in the first period. Ryker Evans failed to intercept two passes between the Sabres skaters.\n\nNot long after a successful penalty kill by the Sabres, Thompson doubled Buffalo’s lead with 9:52 left in the second. Payton Krebs set him up for the shot with a short pass close to the net, as the two were left unguarded by Seattle. It was Thompson’s 16th goal of the season.\n\nStephenson put the Kraken on the board with 7:36 left in the middle period. The goal came 6 seconds into Seattle’s second power play of the night.\n\nBenson added an empty-net goal with 46 seconds left.\n\nDespite the recent win streak, Sabres general manager Kevyn Adams entered this season on the hot seat and there are concerns owner Terry Pegula could shake up his front office sometime this week. Adams is in his sixth season as GM and the Sabres are once again near the bottom of the standings and already in jeopardy of extending their NHL record playoff drought to a 15th season.\n\nSabres: Host Philadelphia on Thursday night.\n\nKraken: Host Colorado on Tuesday night.\n\nAP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL",

    "description": "Following the Colts' Week 15 loss to Seattle, here are three quick takeaways from what took place with Phillip Rivers at quarterback.",
    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts came up short in Week 15 against Seattle. A field goal in the final seconds would secure the win for the Seahawks.\n\nWith the dust having settled on Sunday's game, let's take a look back at what took place with the three things we learned from the Colts' performance.\n\nThis was far from a flashy performance, but Rivers delivered what the Colts needed -- stability at quarterback. He completed 18-of-27 passes for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception.\n\nRivers helped the Colts' offense sustain drives and kept the ball out of harm's way until the very end.\n\nIndianapolis leaned into the running game to keep Rivers and the offense ahead of the sticks and out of long down-and-distance situations, and they relied on the qick passing game as well.\n\nOn both sides of the ball, the Colts fought hard in this game and this team needed some juice after Daniel Jones exited last week's game -- which Rivers provided.\n\nThe Seattle offense entered this game as one of the most productive in football, both in points and in yards, especially through the air. But the Colts were able to contain the Seahawks for much of the game.\n\nFor one, Seattle didn't score a single touchdown in this game. The Colts also did well getting off the field, holding Seattle to just two third-down conversions. The Seahawks offense also averaged a modest 5.3 yards per play.\n\nThe Colts did this while down their top two cornerbacks and without DeForest Buckner.\n\nUltimately, with the game close late, Seattle's more talented offense prevailed. But as the Colts' offense tried to find its footing in this game, the defense kept things close.\n\nAll of that sounds good -- and those are positives -- but the reality is the Colts also lost, and their playoff hopes took another hit.\n\nThe Colts are now 8-6 on the season. With Jacksonville winning on Sunday, Indianapolis is now two games back of the AFC South lead. Houston's win helped them improve to 9-5.\n\nThe Colts now trail the Texans by a game for the AFC's final wildcard spot and are two games back of the 10-4 Chargers and Bills.\n\nThe Colts do play the Texans once more, but also have to face the 10-win 49ers and the 10-win Jaguars.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts lose to Seahawks: 3 takeaways from performance",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers took on the Tennessee Titans on Sunday and earned a win, but there were a few 49ers who didn't have their best games.",
    "fullText": "After a week off, the San Francisco 49ers welcomed the Tennessee Titans to Levi's Stadium for a Week 15 battle, and Kyle Shanahan's squad earned a _ victory, moving them to 10-4 on the season.\n\nWhile San Francisco secured the win, they played far from their best game, and there are quite a few 49ers who will probably want to move on quickly.\n\nHere are some of San Francisco's worst performers from Sunday's win.\n\nBurford has jumped in as the starting left guard after Ben Bartch suffered a season-ending injury and Connor Colby was benched. On Sunday, he allowed the pressure that resulted in Brock Purdy's strip sack. He was also called for a false start on San Francisco's second-to-last possession.\n\nTennessee doesn't boast the best passing game in the league, but they have a decent ground attack. Robert Saleh's unit should've been keyed in on stopping Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears, but the duo combined for 138 yards and a score (Pollard's) on 8.1 yards per attempt. Injuries have decimated San Francisco's defensive front, but they still should be better than that.\n\nRobinson hasn't done much the last couple of weeks, and that streak continued in Week 15, as he ran for just 21 yards on an abysmal 2.3 yards per carry. Christian McCaffrey wasn't efficient either (rushing for 73 yards on 3.3 yards per carry), but he at least found the end zone.\n\nSimmons was wide open in the back of the end zone to catch the second touchdown of his career. That's inexcusable. Luke Gifford was the player closest to Simmons, so he should get the most blame, but no one should be happy after that play.\n\nMore 49ers: Kyle Shanahan says 2025 49ers aren't the team he's been most proud of\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: Worst performances from 49ers' unsatisfying win vs. Titans in Week 15",

    "fullText": "Want to call someone a quick-thinker? The easiest cliché for doing so is calling her a computer – in fact, “computers” was the literal job title of the “Hidden Figures” mathematicians who drove the success of early NASA.\n\nBut while modern electronic computers are far faster than even those mathematical geniuses were with paper, pencils, and slide rules, there’s another type of computing that leaves it eating space dust – optical computing, as fast as the speed of light because instead of using electrons, it uses light itself.\n\nThe need for faster computing isn’t just to satisfy impatient consumers screaming to stream movies while video-chatting, VR gaming, and 3D printing. It’s to handle the Big-Bang-level of data expansion of the modern digital world. The humble graphics processing units (GPUs) in standard computers simply can’t scale or work quickly enough to meet such massive overflow. Even worse, as The Smithsonian Magazine and Sustainability Magazine report, AI data centers filled with GPUs are consuming massive amounts of electricity (mostly from nonrenewable sources) and water (often in arid regions).\n\nEnter Yufeng Zhang (Photonics Group at Aalto University’s Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering) and Xiaobing Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun). In their Nature Photonics paper “Direct tensor processing with coherent light,” lead author Zhang and colleagues reveal their computational method employing a single propagation of light, hence what is known as \"single-shot tensor computing at light speed in a parallel optical matrix–matrix multiplication\" (POMMM).\n\nThat kind of breakthrough brings artificial general intelligence one major step closer.\n\n“Our method performs the same kinds of operations that today’s GPUs handle,” says Zhang, such as “convolutions and attention layers, but does them all at the speed of light.” Instead of standard binary coding information utilizing electronic circuits using signals of ones and zeros, the researchers use the amplitude and phase of light waves to store, process, and communicate data. Doing so not only saves energy, but provides a gigantic expansion of bandwidth and processing speed – in fact, it performs many of its processes simultaneously.\n\nThe combined interactions of light fields naturally produce mathematical operations including tensor multiplications. Tensor processing organizes data into multi-dimensional arrays (think of a 2D array as a single shelf in a filing cabinet, and a 3D array as a filing cabinet with several shelves stacked vertically) called data tensors. Tensor processing is everywhere in leading-edge technology, particularly in data analytics and artificial intelligence, including natural language processing and image recognition. It’s at the heart of deep learning algorithms.\n\nHowever, current optical methods fare poorly with tensor-based tasks, rendering them inefficient for neural networks and other highly complex applications. That’s where the Aalto method offers a major leap forward, by employing multiple wavelengths of light which can handle even extremely demanding tensor operations.\n\nTo explain the difference between electronic and his team’s optical computation, Zhang uses an analogy of package-sorting to explain the difference between electronic and optical computation.\n\n“Imagine you’re a customs officer who must inspect every parcel through multiple machines with different functions and then sort them into the right bins,” says Zhang. “Normally, you’d process each parcel one by one. Our optical computing method merges all parcels and all machines together [by creating] multiple ‘optical hooks’ that connect each input to its correct output. With just one operation, one pass of light, all inspections and sorting happen instantly and in parallel.”\n\nTensor parallel (also called tensor model parallel or TP) processing is an execution strategy for deep learning that deploys multiple devices to address components of the same model, allowing them to compute larger models more quickly. Put another way, many minds make lighter work. Or, in this case, speed-of-light work.\n\nAccording to Zhipei Sun, leader of Aalto University’s Photonics Group, the new method can work on nearly any optical platform, and his team plans “to integrate this computational framework directly onto photonic chips, enabling light-based processors to perform complex AI tasks with extremely low power consumption.”\n\nIf the method works, they expect to deploy it for integration with existing hardware and major platforms within five years. Doing so “will create a new generation of optical computing systems, significantly accelerating complex AI tasks across a myriad of fields.”",

    "description": "Move marks big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as safeguard against Russian attacks",
    "fullText": "Move marks big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as safeguard against Russian attacks\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy has offered to drop Ukraine’s aspirations to join the Nato military alliance, as he held five hours of talks with US envoys in Berlin on Sunday to end the war with Russia.\n\nDonald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made” as he and the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met Zelenskyy in the latest push to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since the second world war – though full details were not divulged.\n\nDmytro Lytvyn, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said Zelenskyy would comment further when the talks conclude on Monday. He added that officials are now considering the draft documents.\n\nBefore the talks, Zelenskyy had offered to drop Ukraine’s goal to join Nato in exchange for western security guarantees.\n\nThe move marks a big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.\n\n“Representatives held in-depth discussions regarding the 20-point plan for peace, economic agendas, and more. A lot of progress was made,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe talks were hosted by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who a source said had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.\n\nZelenskyy described the concession on Nato as a compromise.\n\n“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato: these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said – adding that legally binding security guarantees from the US, Europe and other countries such as Canada and Japan could “prevent another Russian invasion”.\n\nVladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from approximately 10% of Donbas that Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country, and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.\n\nRussian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by leading western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.\n\nZelenskyy had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities, as well as Ukraine’s power and water supplies.\n\nSending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US are looking at a 20-point plan, and that at the end of this there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has had no direct talks with Moscow.\n\nA ceasefire along the current frontlines would be a fair option, he added.\n\nBritain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.\n\nEuropean allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.",

    "fullText": "“How to get better at programming?” is the question I had been asked quite a few times, and today I lay down the 8 rituals I have been following, and action items for each, to be good and get better at programming.\n\nDoing something repeatedly always helps and writing a lot of code will develop our ability to\n\nIf we don’t do something repeatedly, it becomes extremely hard to get good at it. Writing code consistently helps us\n\nSolving programming questions is about developing logic but things become a little trickier when we build a complex system, as it requires us to take our programming skills to go up a notch. Some examples of complex systems are - a Library management system, a Twitter clone, an Instagram clone, etc. Building a complex system\n\nAfter we spend some time writing programs and solving problems, things become monotonous and do not seem to challenge us anymore, so to spice things up a bit we should model something from the real world, like\n\nThere are lots of libraries and framework like p5.js that makes visual programming simple.\n\nIt is not only writing code that improves our programming skills but it is reading some quality code written by expert programmers that make the difference. Reading code written by experts improve our programming vocabulary and by doing this we\n\nThe best way to start doing it is by picking up an open-source project and start skimming the code. It is okay to not understand it in the first go but it is important to skim it a few times and get acquainted. After a few skim, everything will fall in place, the code becomes familiar and we start to understand the flow and business logic.\n\nThere is always someone sitting on the other side of the globe, who knows a thing or two more than us. Look for them and collaborate on a project. The developer community is filled with super smart and super enthusiastic developers who love to share and collaborate. Use websites like Dev.to, Hashnode and Twitter to find and interact with like-minded people.\n\nA programming language is just a tool to express business logic. While learning a programming language we should try to understand the constructs and paradigms used - for example: Functional programming, Polymorphism, Event driven programming, Actor model, etc. It is important to do so because we could pick constructs from one language and use it in another to solve our problem. For example: picking Functional programming (Callbacks) from Javascript and using it in Python to create generic action functions.\n\nWriting code before putting in some thought is degraded the code more often than not. The code written like this lacks simplicity, reusability, and extensibility. Spending some time thinking about problem statement or task at hand and having a rough execution plan always helps.\n\nThese rituals have helped me get better at programming with time and in parallel, I pick at max 3 and act on the action items. Programming is simple but being better than most is difficult. Doing it consistently makes one get better by the day.",

    "fullText": "Rebecca Ann “Burger Becky” Heineman passed away last month, after a brief but intense battle with cancer. Her contributions to video game history are innumerable; if you’ve played a video game made within the past 30 years, chances are she had a hand in its creation in some way. After meeting her at GDC in March 2014, she quickly became one of my mentors. But more than that, I am proud to call her my friend, both of her and her late wife Jennell Jaquays.\n\nBecky and I would chat about all sorts of things, ranging from industry gossip to life to pop culture to programming. I am sad that my friend is no longer available for late night messages or calls, but I’ll always have fond memories to look back upon, not to mention her valuable lessons and wisdom. Some of these I’d like to share in this post.\n\nMy “first encounter” with Becky was not with her directly but, as with most people, through her work, though I didn’t know it at the time.\n\nMy dad—now retired—was a high school band director in 1994. That fall, one of his students gave him a floppy disk with the three-level shareware First Encounter of Wolfenstein 3D for Mac, and encouraged my dad to take it home and play it. Dad played it for about ten seconds and quickly determined it wasn’t for him, but knowing my penchant for gaming, he let me give it a try instead. My sister and I played through those three levels over and over through the rest of that year. I asked for—and got—the full ninety-level version for Christmas.\n\nI had never seen a game like it before; its first-person perspective and animation (such as it was; my dad’s 16MHz Macintosh II could barely run it) blew me away and set my expectations for what a computer game could be. Yet at that time, young me thought that software creation was the work of teams of white-coated scientists in sterilized laboratories like I saw in cartoons; surely this game had to have been developed by a large company armed with legions of workers. After all, the game opened with logos for two very legitimate-looking studios: MacPlay, and id Software. Still, the seed was planted in my head as I slowly taught myself programming that maybe, someday, I could be good enough to work for a company making something as enthralling as Wolfenstein.\n\nMy first interaction with Becky would come several years later, in 2001.\n\nI was following Becky on social media by this time, but I received an unsolicited message from her on Facebook in September 2013. Seems she had seen the news about the Keen source code, and wanted to talk. 😀 I was more than willing to chat, especially knowing that she had the source code to the Mac version of Wolfenstein 3D she had done almost a decade prior. I finally met Becky in person for the first time at GDC 2014, ambushing her after a panel she was on at Moscone North. She fortunately recognized me and we became Facebook friends very shortly after that, instantly bonding over game programming and industry history. At GDC 2016 I offered to buy her dinner at Buca di Beppo; the deal we arranged was that I’d provide the food, and she would provide the entertainment in the form of war stories. 😀 I got to learn the “true Hollywood story” of the Mac versions of not only Wolfenstein 3D, but of the cancelled port of Half-Life. Someday maybe I’ll write a bit about what I learned that night.\n\nI shipped The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime on DVD and GoG in late 2013 to coincide with The Journeyman Project’s 30th anniversary. The production of that by itself warrants its own story, but leading up to the fall of 2016 I was putting the finishing touches on a version for Steam that integrated the Steamworks API for achievements, cloud saves, and controller support. It was with the lattermost that I was having trouble; I encountered, verified, and documented—with reliable repro steps—a bug in Steamworks’s controller code… but could not find a way to communicate any of this to Steamworks engineers at Valve! The official way to report bugs, as it was explained to me, was to make a post on Steam’s forums. I did so, but was met with fellow programmers and non-programmers—none of whom from Valve—advising me to follow the same steps outlined in the Steamworks documentation with which I was well familiar. Ugh. No amount of my explaining “no, I found a legitimate bug here” would get me an audience with an engineer who could help upstream a patch.\n\nWith myself going nowhere through the “official” channels, I realized: Steam Dev Days is coming up in October 2016. I registered myself and scored an invitation to Valve’s developer conference in Seattle. For the price of round-trip plane tickets, my goal was to track down and corner a Steamworks programmer and show them the bug I was fighting. I managed to do so; after waiting in line for a couple hours (most folks were there to talk about Valve’s forays into virtual reality) it took only 30 seconds to demonstrate and explain the problem to the engineer, and sure enough, two weeks later the release notes of the latest version of the Steam client indicated my bug was fixed. ❤️\n\nBecky and Jennell were living in a high-rise apartment in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. They graciously offered to let me stay with them, which was great because my visit was pretty low-budget anyway. That evening, I arrived at their apartment complex, but because Becky was out running an errand, nobody was there to meet me. The neighborhood was perhaps not the safest in town; not that I was worried for myself, but I preferred being indoors at that time of the night. The complex wouldn’t let me in without somebody to come get me, so Jennell came down to greet me, and it was here that I met Jennell for the first time. We talked for hours about her time at id Software, and stories—with varying degrees of “juiciness”—about her experiences there.\n\nBecky and Jennell moved down to El Cerrito in 2018. I loved this; it meant they lived close enough to me that I could hang out with them a lot more often, which I did. I would often deliver them food, watch their place, and grab any delivered packages while they were away. Becky likewise came down to my housewarming in 2018.\n\nTheir archives took up their entire two-car garage, but Becky and Jennell spent most of their time in the front room both doing what they loved most: making games and caring for their cats. Jennell also liked to make and paint miniatures. Years ago, at SVVR 2016, I had myself 3D scanned in a couple of different poses. I sent Jennell one of the files and, on one visit, was delighted to find a tiny painted 3D-printed miniature of myself in her collection, done up to resemble a zombie.\n\nI drove Becky and Jennell up to Portland for the October 2018 Portland Retro Gaming Expo in my 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse. They in turn let me stay with them in their room at the Crowne Plaza downtown. We went to Prime Rib + Chocolate Cake for dinner (RIP), and the next day I joined Becky with David Crane, Garry Kitchen, and other Activision alumni for lunch at the Red Robin across from the convention center.\n\nBecky bought herself a boxed LaserDisc player at the show, and sat with it in the back seat of my Eclipse the whole ride home. Poor Jennell rode in the front seat and was uncomfortable most of the ride, owing to her stature, though she opted to recline as much as she could for as long as she could during the return trip.\n\nIn 2020, Becky and Jennell moved to the Dallas area into the home that Jennell had designed during her time at id Software. Becky would appear at several QuakeCons after that and we’d often hang out; I’d always save her a spot next to me in the BYOC, and she got to meet several members of my Quake clan as well as catch up with friends of hers connected to id, Microsoft, and the 90s gaming scene. One QuakeCon in particular stands out to me: in 2023, I made a point to get lunch with Becky and Jennell at the nearest Torchy’s Tacos. That turned out to be the last time I’d ever see Jennell; she sadly passed away in January 2024. Becky and I continued to hang out whenever I was in Dallas, usually preferring Torchy’s again in memory of that first lunch with her and Jennell. She would also occasionally host her Burgertime streams where I participated in the chat, and when gossip got “too hot for TV” we’d talk on the phone every now and again.\n\nLike most folks close to her, I learned of her cancer diagnosis via her social media announcement. In my last phone call with her, I asked how she was feeling and expressed how confident I was that she’d beat it given how prompt she was with her discovery and medical attention. She continued to have an upbeat attitude and sense of humor in spite of two rounds of chemotherapy and the ultimately unfortunate prognosis. I was in midtown Manhattan when she shared the news from her doctors that she was unlikely to make it through the rest of the following week. She and I had a brief exchange on Discord that Sunday night, but I had a gut feeling that I should try to see her as soon as possible, so upon arriving home early Monday morning I got on the first flight to Dallas.\n\nI made it to the hospital just in time to see Becky and say goodbye. Along with several members of her family, I was with her two hours later when she passed that Monday afternoon.\n\nAs I’m writing this, it still hasn’t quite hit me that she’s gone. Her work endures, and there is so much that she created and put out into the world that memories of her will linger probably well after I have left this earth. The late-night Discord chats, the GDC dinners and meet-and-greets, the random shenanigans, encounters at nerdy conventions… there will always be an empty spot—both physically and metaphysically—in these places from now on. I owe a lot of my career in games to Burger Becky, and with her passing, the world has suffered a great loss. But for all that the loss of Becky has taken from us, she has put so much back into the world. Over the past month I’ve met a number of her friends—both industry and not—who through very personal stories have corroborated just how generous of a person she was. I used to selfishly think I was her protégé, but she was a mentor to so many more people both in their careers and in life. I will miss her greatly, but as long as her memories persist and I pay forward her generosity, she’ll always be with me in some form. I hope that in this way I can introduce new friends to Becky who weren’t as lucky to have met her in real life.\n\nRest in power, Burger Becky. Narf! ❤️",

    "title": "Dark mode is essential, not a design preference",
    "description": "Dark mode is often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a necessity or assistive technology.",
    "fullText": "Dark mode has emerged as one of the most significant accessibility considerations in digital design, yet it is still often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a fundamental feature. Many organisations adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure accessibility compliance, but compliance does not always equate to usability.\n\nFor blind and low-vision users, as well as some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode is not just a preference—it is a necessity. It reduces glare, enhances contrast, and extends the time users can comfortably engage with digital content. Without it, users experience fatigue, headaches, and even an inability to complete tasks, ultimately leading to frustration, abandonment, and exclusion from digital services.\n\nWhen we speak directly to users with lived experience, the importance of dark mode becomes even clearer.\n\nDaniel describes why his phone is permanently set to dark mode:\n\n“My phone's permanently set on a dark mode to reduce the glare of any of the white screens or anything just blasting me in the eyes. It helps me use screens for longer so my eyes don't get as fatigued at the end of the day. Even people who have lost 99% of their vision still have a light sensitivity.”\n\nThis statement challenges a common misconception about blindness—many blind individuals still have some residual vision, and light sensitivity remains a significant issue. For them, bright screens are not just inconvenient; they are painful and actively reduce their ability to engage in digital work and communication.\n\nDan emphasises the connection between screen brightness and headaches and fatigue:\n“When you have this bright light just blasting you in the eyes, it's painful, it gives you headaches. Most of your job you're doing these days, you're looking at a computer screen. There are very few jobs where you're not looking at a computer screen. So if you want to extend how long you're able to do that work for, you need to try and get the most favourable conditions for your eyes.”\n\nThis highlights the occupational accessibility barriers that bright screens create. Digital tools should empower people to work efficiently, not force them into discomfort and early fatigue.\nAnother challenge with bright white backgrounds is the way it affects readability:\n“A bright white background is an issue because it causes bleeding into the other colours. So if you have thin black writing on a white background, the white's so bright that it kind of makes it hard to look at the black writing.”\n\nThis phenomenon, known as halation, makes text appear blurred or distorted for many users, reducing legibility and comprehension. Conversely, dark backgrounds with white text provide greater clarity. Patrick, who has a degenerative eye condition explains:\n“White text on a black background doesn't just look cool, it's much easier on the eyes. When I used white on black, it was easier because the print would stand out much more. Even looking at the time was much easier. The numbers would just jump at you.”\n\nFor users with low vision, neurodivergent conditions like dyslexia, and even those experiencing age-related vision decline, dark mode significantly improves readability and usability.\n\nDespite dark mode's widespread popularity, there is surprisingly little formal research or quantitative data on its accessibility benefits. However, after aggregating insights across multiple See Me Please user testing projects—each involving 18 diverse participants, including 3 blind, 3 with low vision, 3 neurodivergent, 3 Deaf or Hard of Hearing, 3 over 70, and 3 with limited English proficiency—we were struck by how often dark mode emerged as the most requested feature. It was consistently the top accessibility request across companies, often ranking higher than other common accessibility improvements. Based on our experience, we estimate that around 75% of our low vision testers and at least half of our blind testers express a strong preference or need for dark mode.\n\nThis aligns with broader user preferences, as many others—including neurodivergent users and those sensitive to screen brightness—also value dark mode for comfort and usability. While accessibility standards often overlook dark mode, our findings suggest it is a critical feature that enhances real-world usability for a wide range of users.\n\nDesign and development teams only have so much capacity, and when considering investments in accessibility, it's crucial to prioritise features that deliver the greatest impact for users. Our user testing strongly suggests that dark mode is not just a preference but a necessity, resonating far more than the collective value placed on embedded read-aloud features, which are often included on websites but rarely requested by people with a disability with the same urgency. If organisations are weighing accessibility investments, particularly in enterprise settings, thinking about how dark mode can be integrated—at least in new applications—could provide far greater usability benefits than other commonly implemented accessibility features\n\nWCAG provides an essential foundation for digital accessibility, yet it does not specifically require dark mode support. While it recommends sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.1, Success Criterion 1.4.3), the standard does not ensure that interfaces are comfortable for all users.\nStudies on dark mode’s impact show that:\n\nDespite these benefits, many organisations assume meeting WCAG contrast requirements is enough. However, true accessibility is about usability, not just compliance. If a user is technically able to read content but experiences discomfort, pain, or excessive strain, that content is not truly accessible.\n\nWithout dark mode, users often face severe consequences:\n\nFor businesses and government agencies, failing to offer dark mode creates barriers to service access, particularly for those who rely on assistive technologies.\n\nMany users rely on plug-ins and third-party tools like Dark Reader, Midnight Lizard, and Stylus to force dark mode on websites that don’t natively support it. While these tools provide short-term solutions, they are essentially overlays, which introduce several accessibility issues.\n\nOverlays modify the display at the browser level, rather than adjusting the UI in a way that is intended, tested, or optimised by the original developers. This can cause:\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about overlays is that they solve accessibility problems. In reality, they often introduce new barriers rather than removing them.\n\nThe key difference between pushing colour inversion with a plug-in versus native dark mode comes down to control and consistency. Colour inversion, when applied through a plug-in or system-wide setting, works as an overlay that forcibly inverts colours at the browser level rather than adjusting the UI as intended. This can cause significant distortions to images, icons, and visual elements, often making essential content unreadable— for example, a blue sky might turn orange, and important graphs or charts may lose their meaning. Additionally, colour inversion frequently results in inconsistent styling, breaking UI elements, making text difficult to read, and creating poor contrast ratios that worsen accessibility instead of improving it. Users often find themselves constantly adjusting settings, toggling between modes just to complete simple tasks, leading to unnecessary frustration and cognitive load.\n\nIn contrast, native dark mode is designed intentionally within an application to provide a seamless and accessible experience. It ensures proper contrast and readability, preserving the original intent of the design while keeping images and key visual cues intact. Native dark mode works smoothly with assistive technologies, including screen readers, and prevents the need for users to rely on third-party fixes. While plug-in-based colour inversion can serve as a temporary workaround, it is ultimately a patchwork solution that introduces new usability issues, whereas native dark mode provides a structured, user-friendly approach that truly enhances accessibility.\n\nAnother common workaround is colour inversion, available in operating system accessibility settings. This setting flips light to dark and vice versa, making bright screens easier to tolerate. However, this also inverts images, icons, and visual elements, which can:\n\nThis constant toggling between modes adds unnecessary cognitive load and frustration, making simple tasks time-consuming and exhausting.\n\nInstead of relying on overlays and forced inversion, websites and apps should natively support dark mode in their design. A well-implemented dark mode ensures that all visual elements are designed intentionally, avoiding the distortions caused by inversion, colour contrast and legibility are optimised for all users and dark mode can be toggled at the user’s preference, rather than relying on inefficient and frustrating workarounds.\n\nGlobally, over 2.2 billion people have some form of vision impairment, and 1 in 5 people are neurodivergent. Many of these individuals benefit from dark mode, making it a high-impact accessibility feature.\nMoreover, the value of offering dark mode and benefit so many more users. For example\n\nDark mode is not just a design trend—it is a fundamental accessibility need. While WCAG provides a great starting point, lived experience must drive digital accessibility efforts. By offering native dark mode support, organisations can create truly inclusive digital experiences and ensure that all users can engage comfortably and effectively.\n\nAs Mary, our wise blind tester said\n“We know what we need and we know what we want from programmes or apps. So it is always best to ask the user.”\n\nLets start listening on those who rely on accessible online services, rather than obsessing over WCAG conformance.",

    "description": "The two-time Emmy winner and Oscar nominee and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Brentwood home.",
    "fullText": "Rob Reiner, who directed such beloved Hollywood classics as This Is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me and When Harry Met Sally after starring in the trailblazing sitcom All in the Family, died Sunday along with his wife, Michele, in their Brentwood home, TMZ reported. He was 78.\n\nReiner and his wife, 70, were found dead in their home on Chadbourne Avenue, with the couple “suffering lacerations consistent with a knife,” law enforcement sources told TMZ. The Los Angeles Fire Department had been called to their house at about 3:30 p.m., and LAPD Robbery Homicide Division detectives were investigating.\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987), Misery (1990), the Oscar best picture nominee A Few Good Men (1992), The American President (1995) and The Bucket List (2007) also were among Reiner’s 20-plus directing credits.\n\nReiner was also a co-founder of Castle Rock Entertainment, the production company behind such films as City Slickers (1991), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Waiting for Guffman (1996), Miss Congeniality (2000), Best in Show (2000), Michael Clayton (2007) and Seinfeld, one of the most lucrative television properties of all time.\n\nFrom the outset of his feature directorial career with This Is Spinal Tap (1984), Reiner seemed to reimagine Hollywood standards, creating and starring in the first mainstream mockumentary — a rock ’n’ roll satire so dead-on, film critic Roger Ebert called it “one of the funniest movies ever made.” From there, he would move seamlessly from comedy to drama, from fantasy to horror, as few directors ever have.\n\nReiner would establish yet another benchmark — this time for romantic comedies — with When Harry Met Sally (1989), screenwriter Nora Ephron’s ode to true love (based loosely on her and Reiner’s lives) that starred Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.\n\nHis biggest box office hit, the gripping courtroom drama A Few Good Men, based on Aaron Sorkin’s 1989 play and starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, could not have been more different.\n\nSome of Reiner’s movies took a while to capture the world’s attention. The Princess Bride, his timeless fairy tale adventure that was based on the William Goldman novel and starred Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin and Peter Falk, was one of several films that grew in popularity over decades on the way to cult status.\n\nOn television, Reiner played to some of the biggest audiences in history, first in the role of Michael “Meathead” Stivic, the liberal antagonist of Carroll O’Connor’s Archie Bunker, on CBS’ All in the Family, and then as a ground-floor executive on NBC’s Seinfeld, which he fought to keep on the air.\n\n“We knew we had a great show,” Reiner told Howard Stern in 2016.\n\nBut after a rocky launch in the summer of 1989, the network was concerned that Seinfeld — famously a show “about nothing” — was a misfire. After four episodes, it was on the brink of cancellation.\n\n“I went in there and had a screaming crazy thing with [NBC president] Brandon Tartikoff,” Reiner said. “And I promised him — there will be stories!”\n\nIn 1993, Reiner and Castle Rock partners Andrew Scheinman, Alan Horn, Glenn Padnick and Martin Shafer sold their company to broadcast mogul Ted Turner for about $160 million. (It became part of Time Warner when it acquired Turner Broadcasting in 1996.)\n\nThe principals stayed on, holding to their original ideal: to make independent movies outside the traditional studio system. But after a run of poorly performing films starting in the late ’90s, Castle Rock initiated layoffs and eventually was absorbed into Warner Bros.\n\nIn 2020, Reiner relaunched the company and revived its film division a year later, with Spinal Tap II: The End Continues (2025) among its offerings.\n\n“There’s not one film that I’ve ever made that could get made today by a studio, not one — even A Few Good Men,” Reiner said. “Every movie that I make, have made and will make is always going to be independently financed.”\n\nThroughout his behind-the-camera career, Reiner continued as a working actor. He played the well-intentioned plastic surgeon Dr. Morris Packman, who affectionately spars with Goldie Hawn, in The First Wives Club (1996); Tom Hanks’ pal in Ephron’s Sleepless in Seattle (1993); and the father of Zooey Deschanel on the 2011-18 Fox sitcom New Girl.\n\nHe was particularly memorable in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) as stockbroker Max Belfort in scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill that were largely improvised.\n\nReiner’s sense of what worked onscreen was honed early on — first at home as the oldest child of comedy icon Carl Reiner and later around his dad’s close friends, among them Sid Caesar, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks and the most influential of all, Norman Lear, the TV auteur whose 1970s activist comedies All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Good Times and Maude sparked seismic shifts in popular culture.\n\n“Norman was the first guy who recognized that I had any talent,” Reiner wrote for The Hollywood Reporter in the wake of Lear’s 2023 death, noting that he viewed him as “a second father.”\n\n“It wasn’t just that he hired me for All in the Family,” Reiner told American Masters in 2005. “It was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.”\n\nAs the Hollywood scion forged his directing career, it was Lear who put up the money for Stand by Me (1986) and Reiner’s other early films, including the John Cusack-Nicollette Sheridan romp The Sure Thing (1985), lauded for elevating the teen comedy genre.\n\nStand by Me — regarded as among the finest of coming-of-age movies — marked Reiner’s ascent into Hollywood’s highest ranks, no longer just a sitcom actor or the genial ex-husband of a fellow TV comic, Penny Marshall, star of Laverne & Shirley. (Marshall too would go on to become a top Hollywood director.)\n\nFamed author-screenwriter Goldman, who penned the Misery screenplay, said Reiner became a success because his work is “funny, but not simpy.”\n\n“His films have a certain comedy style … a sweetness and toughness,” Goldman told The New York Times in 1987. “Stand by Me is not just about four kids coming of age before junior high school — they’re going to see a corpse. If John Hughes had made Stand by Me — and I’m not knocking Hughes — they would have been searching for a convertible.”\n\nStephen King, author of the 1982 novella The Body (on which Stand by Me was based) and the 1987 novel Misery, became one of Reiner’s most-steadfast collaborators.\n\nAmong other King books turned into movies by Castle Rock — Reiner named the company for the fictional setting in many of the author’s novels — were Shawshank, The Green Mile (1999)and Dolores Claiborne (1995).\n\nAfter several false starts, King finally agreed to develop Misery for the screen, but only if Reiner put “his name on it” as producer or director.\n\n“It was a very personal book to him,” Reiner told TCM in 2021. “It was all about himself as a writer and feeling trapped … And so he let us option the book for $1. In fact, I think we made seven Stephen King films, and each one of them we got an option for $1.”\n\nThe 1990 Kathy Bates-James Caan starrer remains one of Hollywood’s finest horror pieces, with Bates winning an Oscar for her role as the obsessive fan Annie Wilkes, who tortures author Paul Sheldon (Caan) while holding him hostage in her remote cabin.\n\n“Rob had a fantastic crew of people — people he had worked with for years, just the creme de la creme,” Bates said of the Misery shoot in a 2020 interview with Vanity Fair. “I learned so much just hanging out [on set] and watching.”\n\nBates, 42 years old at the time, had predominantly been a stage actress. At the Academy Awards, where she bested Meryl Streep, Joanne Woodward, Anjelica Huston and Julia Roberts, she thanked Reiner “for taking a chance on me.”\n\nOften the most memorable scenes in Reiner’s filmography came from his comedies — notably Ryan’s climactic moment in When Harry Met Sally in which she feigns an orgasm over lunch with Crystal’s character at Katz’s Deli.\n\nYet it was Reiner’s mother, Estelle Reiner, who landed the film’s renowned punchline: “I’ll have what she’s having.”\n\n“I said to her, mom, the line you have is the last line in the scene, and if it doesn’t pop and top everything that’s come before it, I won’t use it,” Reiner told the AFI in a joint interview with Ephron in 2009. “We’ll shoot it but be prepared, it might have to be cut.\n\n“And she said, ‘I don’t care, I just wanna spend the day with you and be with you on the set. I don’t care if it’s in the movie or not.’”\n\nRobert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947, one of three children of the former Estelle Lebost, an artist and set designer, and Carl Reiner, the comic and writer who got his start as an entertainer in the U.S. Army and then in Broadway musicals.\n\nThe family lived just off Grand Concourse, across the street from Marshall and her brother, future writer-producer-director Garry Marshall. But it would be decades before Rob and Penny actually met — at the 1970 audition in Los Angeles for the roles of Mike and Gloria Stivik on All in the Family. (The role of Gloria, of course, would go to Sally Struthers.)\n\nAs Carl’s career gained steam (he would win 11 Emmys), the family moved to Bonnie Meadow Road in the bucolic New York suburb of New Rochelle. It was the very street where Reiner would set his landmark 1960s CBS sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, about a rising comedy writer, Rob Petrie, and his beautiful wife, Laura.\n\n“Basically he wrote his own life in The Dick Van Dyke Show,” Rob Reiner said of his father. “And my mother was Mary Tyler Moore.”\n\nRob got his start as an apprentice at the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania and with small guest roles on such shows as That Girl, Room 222 and The Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nAfter UCLA Film School in 1967, he was paired with another young comic, Steve Martin, as a writing team on CBS’ The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The two were barely out of their teens.\n\nThe All in the Family role, for which Reiner would win two Emmys, followed in 1971. Convinced the show’s incendiary subject matter would be rejected by viewers, he initially viewed the gig as a stopgap to tide him over between writing gigs.\n\nWhen the sitcom became a hit (Reiner stayed for eight of its nine seasons), he continued writing anyway, penning four episodes of the show and co-writing (with Garry Marshall and Phil Mishkin) the first episode of ABC’s Happy Days in 1974.\n\nAs a filmmaker notably surrounding himself with many of the industry’s top writers — Goldman, King, Sorkin, Ephron, Crystal — Reiner showcased their dialogue to everlasting effect.\n\nThe Princess Bride’s “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die”; Misery’s “I’m your No. 1 fan”; A Few Good Men’s “You can’t handle the truth”; and When Harry Met Sally’s “I’ll have what she’s having” (Crystal actually came up with that line) reigned in pop culture for decades.\n\nBut as Penny Marshall would humorously point out, no matter how substantive their accomplishments, “For me, all they say is ‘Laverne,’ and for Rob … it’s ‘Meathead,’” she told the New Yorker in 2012. “We’re stuck with it.”\n\nThe couple performed together infrequently but did co-star in the well-received 1978 romantic comedy More Than Friends. The ABC telefilm, written by Reiner and Mishkin and directed by James Burrows, was something of a precursor to When Harry Met Sally, about childhood pals unsure if they should pursue love as adults.\n\nReiner also made an appearance as “Sheldn” (no “o”), the fiancé of Penny’s Myrna Turner, on Garry Marshall’s ABC series The Odd Couple.\n\nTheir 10-year marriage came to an end in 1981 — amid tension as Laverne & Shirley shot Marshall to superstardom while Reiner was quietly forging his post-sitcom film career.\n\nUpon Marshall’s death in 2018, Reiner professed his admiration for her, tweeting “so sad about Penny.” He added, “I loved Penny. I grew up with her. She was born with a great gift. She was born with a funny bone and the instinct of how to use it. I was very lucky to have lived with her and her funny bone. I will miss her.”\n\nThe couple were the parents of actress Tracy Reiner, born in 1964 to Marshall during a brief first marriage and adopted by Reiner soon after their 1971 wedding.\n\nIn 1989, Reiner married Michele Singer, a photographer whom he met on the set of When Harry Met Sally. He said she was the inspiration for the film’s happily-ever-after script change. In 2020, she joined Reiner in running Castle Rock. The couple had three children, Nick, Jake and Romy.\n\nA lifelong political activist who with King was among the public figures to urge President Joe Biden to hand the 2024 re-election reins to Kamala Harris, Reiner rarely missed a week on social media, penning calls to action on a range of social justice issues for his millions of followers.\n\nHe was among Hollywood’s most vigorous and constant voices opposing Donald Trump.\n\nAmong his other causes, Reiner was the co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which fought to overturn California’s ban on same-sex marriage. In the late-’90s, he and his father were activists for higher taxes on cigarettes — money that was earmarked for prenatal care.\n\nHis advocacy was often part of his writing and filmmaking, from his earliest days with the Smothers brothers to LBJ (2016) and Shock and Awe (2017), about journalists investigating the Bush administration’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nReiner was often a Hollywood peacemaker, well known for putting actors and crew at ease. When Bates and Caan clashed early in the production of Misery (she liked rehearsing; he preferred winging it), Reiner brokered a wary peace while using the tension to elicit superb performances.\n\n“I want everyone around me to feel comfortable and happy,” he told The Guardian in 2018. “People only act up out of insecurity, and when they make it difficult, I just say, ‘We’re playing make-believe here — enjoy yourself!’”",

    "fullText": "GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo on Sunday said he had declared a state of emergency in two municipalities in western Guatemala a day after armed men attacked a military post and a police station, cut off roads and hijacked buses, killing at least five people.\n\nCriminal gangs are attempting to force security forces to withdraw in order to take control of the region, Arévalo said. He said his government would reinforce security.\n\nThis state of emergency, the first declared by his government, will last for 15 days in the municipalities of Nahuala and Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan in the department of Solola.\n\n“We are at a critical moment for the department of Solola and the security of the country,” Arévalo said, accompanied Interior Minister Marco Villeda and José Giovanni Martínez Milán, the acting Defense Minister and head of General Staff.\n\nArévalo showed videos and photos from Saturday’s events, in which armed men - some dressed in camouflage or military uniforms, wearing helmets and bulletproof vests and carrying high-caliber weapons - can be seen shooting or taking cover just meters away from a busy main road.\n\nThe criminal groups are linked to extortion and drug trafficking and pose a threat to the local communities, Arévalo said.\n\n“The communities are not alone,” he said.\n\nInterior Minister Marco Villeda said that five people had died. On Saturday, the director of the National Civil Police, David Botero, said that six people had died, including a soldier.\n\nThe incidents are believed to have started last Thursday when armed men attacked the military post, leaving four people wounded at that time.\n\nThe two municipalities have had disputes for several decades over water sources and local roads they both claim as their own. These disputes have led to dozens of deaths.\n\n“In this case, there was no attack between the communities. This was an attack on the military post, intentionally and specifically,” Arévalo said.\n\nThe state of emergency limits the rights to open-air meetings, public demonstrations and events. It allows for the dissolution by force of any unauthorized gatherings, groups, or public demonstrations, particularly those involving weapons or violent acts.\n\nIt also limits the right to protests that affect free movement or public services, which can be forcibly dissolved, and restricts the right to carry weapons.",

    "title": "DNA From Beethoven's Hair Reveals a Surprise 200 Years Later",
    "description": "A tragic irony.",
    "fullText": "On a stormy Monday in March, 1827, the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven passed away after a protracted illness.\n\nBedridden since the previous Christmas, he was ravaged by jaundice, his limbs and abdomen swollen, and every breath a struggle.\n\nAs his associates sorted through personal belongings, they uncovered a document Beethoven had written a quarter of a century earlier – a will beseeching his brothers to make details of his condition known to the public.\n\nToday it is no secret that one of the greatest musicians the world has ever known was functionally deaf by his mid-40s.\n\nIt was a tragic irony Beethoven wished the world understood, not just from a personal perspective, but a medical one.\n\nThe composer would outlive his doctor by nearly two decades, yet close to two centuries after Beethoven's death, a team of researchers set out to fulfill his testament in ways he would never have dreamed possible, by genetically analyzing the DNA in authenticated samples of his hair.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary of the research:\n\n\"Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethoven's health problems, which famously include progressive hearing loss, beginning in his mid- to late-20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818,\" biochemist Johannes Krause from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany explained in a press statement in 2023, when the results were unveiled.\n\nThe primary cause of that hearing loss has never been known, not even to his personal physician Dr Johann Adam Schmidt.\n\nWhat began as tinnitus in his 20s slowly gave way to a reduced tolerance for loud noise, and eventually a loss of hearing in the higher pitches, effectively ending his career as a performing artist.\n\nFor a musician, nothing could be more ironic. In a letter addressed to his brothers, Beethoven admitted he was \"hopelessly afflicted\", to the point of contemplating suicide.\n\nIt wasn't just hearing loss the composer had to deal with in his adult life. From at least the age of 22 he is said to have suffered severe abdominal pains and chronic bouts of diarrhea.\n\nSix years before his death the first indications of liver disease appeared, an illness thought to have been, at least in part, responsible for his death at the relatively young age of 56.\n\nIn 2007 a forensic investigation into a lock of hair believed to belong to Beethoven suggested that lead poisoning could have hastened his death, if not have been ultimately responsible for the symptoms that claimed his life.\n\nGiven the culture of drinking from lead vessels and medical treatments of the time that involved the use of lead, it's hardly a surprising conclusion.\n\nThis latest study, published in March 2023, debunks the theory, however, revealing that the hair never came from Beethoven in the first place, but rather an unknown woman.\n\nMore importantly, several locks confirmed as far more likely to be from the composer's head indicate his death was probably caused by a hepatitis B infection, exacerbated by his drinking and numerous risk factors for liver disease.\n\n\"We cannot say definitely what killed Beethoven, but we can now at least confirm the presence of significant heritable risk, and an infection with hepatitis B virus,\" explained Krause.\n\n\"We can also eliminate several other less plausible genetic causes.\"\n\n\"We were unable to find a definitive cause for Beethoven's deafness or gastrointestinal problems,\" Krause said.\n\nIn some ways, we're left with more questions on the life and death of the famous classical composer.\n\nWhere did he contract hepatitis? How did a lock of woman's hair pass as Beethoven's own for centuries? And just what was behind his gut pains and hearing loss?\n\nGiven the team was inspired by Beethoven's desire for the world to understand his hearing loss, it's an unfortunate outcome. Though there was one more surprise buried among his genes.\n\nFurther investigation comparing the Y chromosome in the hair samples with those of modern relatives descending from Beethoven's paternal line point to a mismatch.\n\nThis suggests extramarital sexual activity in the generations leading up to the composer's birth.\n\n\"This finding suggests an extrapair paternity event in his paternal line between the conception of Hendrik van Beethoven in Kampenhout, Belgium in c.1572 and the conception of Ludwig van Beethoven seven generations later in 1770, in Bonn, Germany,\" said Tristan Begg, a biological anthropologist now at the University of Cambridge in the UK.\n\nIt could all be a little more than a younger Beethoven bargained for, considering the fateful request he put to paper.\n\nNever would he have dreamed of the secrets that were being preserved as his friends and associates clipped the hair from his body in the wake of that somber stormy Monday night in 1827.\n\nThis research was published in Current Biology.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in March 2023.\n\nScientists Analyzed The Obituaries of 38 Million Americans.

    "fullText": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González signed a polemic bill on Sunday that critics say is a blow to democracy and will make it more difficult to access public information in a U.S. territory long known for its lack of government transparency.\n\nGonzález said the bill amends an existing law to provide more defined rules, avoid confusion and reduce what she said was a “considerable number of lawsuits.” She said it also sets penalties for non-compliance\n\nMore than a dozen journalism organizations and civil rights groups have rejected the bill, noting that only one day of public hearings was held on short notice.\n\n“It is inconceivable that Puerto Rico’s leaders would go out of their way to harm their constituents’ access to information and degrade the quality of press freedom on the island,” said Clayton Weimers, executive director for Reporters Without Borders in North America.\n\nWith the new law, government agencies now have 20 business days instead of 10 to hand over documents with fewer than 300 pages or that were created less than three years ago.\n\nAgencies also now have up to one month to release documents longer than 300 pages or more than three years old, with a 20-day extension upheld.\n\n“By signing this measure into law, despite widespread opposition, the governor makes it clear that her interest is not in government transparency,” the ACLU of Puerto Rico said. “(The law) is not in anyone’s best interest, except for any public official who seeks to hinder or prevent the public from receiving the information they have a right to see.”\n\nEarlier this month, a coalition of journalism organizations and civil society groups sent a letter to the governor asking that she veto the bill, calling it a “dangerous infringement on the public’s right to know.”\n\nThe letter noted the bill not only doubles the length of time government agencies have to release requested information, it would also “allow the government to classify information as confidential without judicial review and eliminate personal privacy protections for those requesting information.”\n\nThe bill also removes “the government’s previous obligation under the 2019 law to provide information in the requested format, making data analysis more difficult …(and) would also allow the government to deny valid requests because the information is spread across several documents or agencies,” according to the letter.\n\nObtaining public information in Puerto Rico has long been difficult, often forcing local media organizations that could afford it to go to court despite the government approving a law in 2019 to allow access to public information held by state agencies.\n\nThe 2019 law noted that in Puerto Rico, “citizens and the press are subject to discretionary court processes that are costly and can take months when they request public information. Although the right to access information is enshrined in the Constitution, the lack of a procedural mechanism to enforce it leads to frequent violations.”\n\nThe 2019 law also stated that “many governments have promised transparency but have never committed to it. This is one of the factors that has contributed to the erosion of public trust in the government, which has become a complex, bureaucratic, and opaque structure in its decision-making.”\n\nSeveral years ago, one local newspaper made it a habit to publish its requests for public information and how much time had passed without receiving a response from state agencies.\n\nPuerto Rico’s Senate approved the bill in mid-October with 18 votes in favor and nine against, with no public hearings held. The House passed it in November after only one day of hearings, with 29 votes in favor and 24 against.",

    "description": "\"We apologize that it has been necessary to recall this product.\"",
    "fullText": "A major European grocery store recalled one of its goods because it may contain clear plastic pellets.\n\nIrish grocer Dunnes Stores and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland issued the notice for 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) packages of Dunnes organic porridge oats, The Irish Sun reported.\n\n\"Customers are advised not to consume this product, instead to return it to a Dunnes Stores store for a full refund. No receipt is required,\" the company stated, per the Sun. \"We apologize that it has been necessary to recall this product and for the inconvenience caused.\"\n\nThe products were stamped with the batch code 5284 FI, the best-before date of Nov. 10, and times between 06:00 and 12:00. The oats cost €1.39 ($1.62).\n\nDunnes, which has 138 locations in Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Spain, also recently recalled desiccated coconut items because of a similar issue.\n\nPlastic pellets in food are a health hazard. It may be most concerning, however, that the oats reached store shelves before the problem was addressed. If food manufacturing and safety regulations don't prevent this from occurring or stop products from leaving facilities after such events, it raises questions about the ability of companies and agencies to protect the public.\n\nSince plastic is ubiquitous in production and packaging systems, it is common, if not usual, for all kinds of merchandise to be recalled because of plastic contamination. This happens in countries around the world and with various products, including pulled pork sandwiches, whitefish spread, and brownies.\n\nWhile some contaminants may be large enough to see (or choke on), others are microscopic, and microplastics have been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer, infertility, strokes, and heart attacks.\n\nDunnes removed the affected oats from shelves and posted the recall information. Other pollutants, however, create more complex problems. For example, a biodegradable plastic used in food packaging was shown to reprogram mice's metabolic systems.\n\nYou can lower your risks by using less plastic, especially when it comes to water bottles, food containers, and clothing. Choose reusable glass receptacles, bring your own to-go boxes to restaurants, and buy garments made with natural fibers. You can also wash your apparel with powdered detergent — and without fabric softener — and use wool dryer balls.\n\nWhen it comes to eating, whole foods are generally cleaner than processed options.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) — Exposure to freezing temperatures near Morocco’s border with Algeria killed nine African migrants, a tragedy that rights groups in the North African country called deeply concerning and a violation of the right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe bodies of seven men and two women were found in Ras Asfour, a remote mountainous Moroccan area known for its plunging temperatures in winter, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights said Saturday in a statement.\n\n“They died from extreme cold, which their exhausted bodies could not withstand,” it said.\n\nOne of the migrants was from Guinea, the group said. The rest were from various countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, though specific information about their identities remains unknown. Morocco’s Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the individuals who died.\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants seeking better living conditions attempt to crossing illegal from North Africa to Europe, including from Morocco to Spain. Some aim for Ceuta and Melilla – two tiny Spanish enclaves in North Africa – by scaling border fences or swimming. Others attempt to reach Spain’s Canary Islands, taking a longer route through the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe North African nation’s security forces regularly report blocking such attempts.\n\nThroughout Europe and Africa, North Africa is known as a transit point for migrants en route to Europe’s southern border.\n\nSecurity agreements with the European Union have strengthen authorities' ability to deter migration in North Africa. Many who originally intended to migrate to Europe spend months or years working informally — doing construction, agriculture or domestic work. Others rely on aid while waiting for opportunities to cross the Mediterranean Sea or Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Moroccan Association of Human Rights statement said six of the bodies were buried last week and two were kept at the request of their relatives. “We will make sure that this case is followed up on,” it said.\n\nThe Moroccan Organization of Human Rights — a different association — earlier this week called for the humanization of borders, the decriminalization of illegal migration and residence, and the creation of a mechanism to track missing migrants to prevent tragedies like the one in Ras Asfour.\n\nFollow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

Among the casualties was Rabbi Eli Schlanger, the assistant rabbi at the Chabad of Bondi, a Chabad official told the New York Times.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy,” said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He added: “An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.”\n\nThe two shooters were a 50-year-old man who was fatally shot by police and a 24-year-old man who suffered “critical injuries,” police said.\n\nGunfire was heard on the popular beachfront around 6:47 p.m. local time Sunday, authorities said. Witnesses told the Daily Mail that they saw two men exit a vehicle close to the waterfront and begin firing dozens of rounds at beachgoers.\n\nNSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said that more than 1,000 people were at the Hannukkah event at Archer Park on the northern end of the beach when the shooting took place. “As a result of the circumstances of the incident tonight, at 9:36 p.m. this evening, I declared this to be a terrorist incident,” Lanyon said.\n\nFootage widely shared on social media shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the weapon from his hands, and then turning it back on him, forcing the attacker to retreat.\n\n“It’s the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen,” NSW Premier Chris Minns said in a late-night press conference. “Walking to a gunman… and singlehandedly disarming him, putting his own life at risk... that man is a genuine hero and I’ve got no doubt there are many, many people alive due to his bravery.\"\n\nExtraordinary vision reportedly taken from the scene of the Bondi Beach shooting appears to a show a man heroically tackling and disarming one of the shooters.\n\nVision circulating social media shows an unidentified bystander approaching the gunman, who had just discharged his… pic.twitter.com/GJIRYJcD0W\n\n— 10 News (@10NewsAU) December 14, 2025\n\nThe hero bystander was identified by relatives as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed. His cousin told 7News that the dad of two was shot twice and will undergo surgery.\n\n“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” said the cousin, identified by the outlet only as Mustafa.\n\n“We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 percent.”\n\nIn separate footage, two men can be seen standing on a passenger bridge while firing multiple shots into the parkland that surrounds the beach.\n\n“This cowardly act of terrifying violence is shocking and painful to see and represents some of our worst fears about terrorism in Sydney,” Minns added.\n\n“This attack was designed to target Sydney’s Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah, what should have been a night of peace and joy celebrated in that community with families and supporters, has been shattered by this horrifying, evil attack.”\n\nBondi is an area of the city with a large Jewish population, and Sunday marks the first day of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.\n\nA “Chanukah by the Sea” event, planned for Sunday, began at 5 p.m. local time on the beach where community members were set to light the first candle on a giant Menorah, enjoy a petting farm, and receive free face painting.\n\n“Join Chabad of Bondi for our Annual Chanukah Festival as We Celebrate Jewish Life by lighting up the Iconic Bondi Beach,” the event information page reads.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added at the press conference. “This is an act of evil antisemitism terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation.”\n\n“Every Australian tonight will be like me, devastated over this attack on our way of life. There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear, we will eradicate it.”\n\nTension between community groups has been increasingly strained in Australia following the outbreak of the war in Gaza in 2023.\n\nSydney has been the site of numerous pro-Palestine protests, including one demonstration in August that saw an estimated 90-300,000 people march across the famous Harbour Bridge.\n\n“The events at Bondi Beach are an absolute atrocity. A horror for the victims and a massive escalation of the hatred directed at Australia’s Jewish community,” former conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbot said on X.\n\n“There should be no place in Australia for the kind of evil we’ve seen this evening,” he added. “Thank God one bystander heroically intervened showing the good side of our country.”\n\nBondi Beach is one of the world’s most iconic beaches and a central hub of Sydney life. With close proximity to the CBD, a vibrant community, and world-class surf, this waterfront neighbourhood is known for its luxury properties and upper-class living.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the beach was packed with holidaymakers and locals cooling off in the water from the 90-degree heat when the shooting began.\n\nVideo footage of the incident shows hundreds of people sprinting across the white sand for cover as shots ring out in the background.\n\nWitnesses say dozens of shots were fired, while other imagery shows bullets and casings from high-powered rifle weaponry on the floor.\n\n“For twenty minutes, they shoot, shoot. Change magazines and just shoot,” one Israeli eyewitness told a 7 News journalist who was on the scene.\n\n“It’s terrible. In the middle of Bondi. It’s terrible.”\n\nThis community is no stranger to tragedy. The Bondi neighborhood was the subject of a mass stabbing incident in April of last year, with six people stabbed to death and 12 people injured at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre. That incident was not considered a terror attack.\n\nMass shootings are rare in Australia following the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996 in which 35 people were shot dead and a further 23 wounded. In the immediate aftermath of that event, then Prime Minister John Howard implemented a mandatory firearm buyback scheme which saw 650,000 newly prohibited firearms removed from circulation in Australia.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nConsumer confidence dropped sharply in November, falling to its lowest point since April, when concern over President Trump’s tariffs was driving economic anxiety (1).\n\nPossibly as a result, Americans have pulled back on spending. A delayed report from the Department of Commerce shows that while consumer spending rose 0.02% from the previous month, sales are sluggish compared to the 0.6% increase recorded in July and August and 1% increase in June (2).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nWhat are they doing with their money instead? New research from JPMorgan Chase's Institute of Financial Health and Wealth Creation found that after accounting for inflation, savings and checking balances have essentially been stagnant for nearly two years .\n\nWhen it comes to high-income households, bank balances have even been shrinking, landing at negative 2% in October 2025 (3).\n\nThe report notes that higher-income households are instead moving cash out of regular bank accounts and into higher-yield options, such as money market funds, brokerage accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) (3).\n\nWith inflation hovering around 3.0% — well above the 2% target — it seems traditional accounts just aren’t cutting it (4).\n\nWith incomes barely improving and everyday costs still high, many consumers now have “just enough to spend but not enough to splurge,” which explains why spending is falling.\n\nRather than spending more, many households are turning to investment-style options with higher returns for their cash. If you're thinking about doing the same, here are some of the most popular alternatives:\n\nThese function like regular savings accounts but offer much higher interest rates. For example, a SoFi checking and savings account can help you build your wealth base through a combination of high-interest rates, zero fees and ease of access.\n\nA SoFi account can provide a base 3.60% APY, but new clients can get a 0.70% boost for up to 6 months for a total APY of 4.30%. That’s over ten times the national deposit savings rate, according to the FDIC’s November report.",

    "fullText": "If you needed a sign for how determined AI-land is to achieve AGI quickly, it's that one of its leaders sees the speed of human typing as one of its biggest roadblocks.\n\nAlexander Embiricos, who leads product development for Codex, OpenAI's coding agent, said on \"Lenny's Podcast\" on Sunday that the \"current underappreciated limiting factor\" to AGI is \"human typing speed\" or \"human multi-tasking speed on writing prompts.\"\n\nAGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a still theoretical version of AI that reasons as well or better than humans. It's the thing all the big AI companies are competing to be the first to realize.\n\n\"You can have an agent watch all the work you're doing, but if you don't have the agent also validating its work, then you're still bottlenecked on, like, can you go review all that code?\" Embiricos said.\n\nEmbiricos' view is that we need to unburden humans from having to write prompts and validate AI's work, since we aren't fast enough.\n\n\"If we can rebuild systems to let the agent be default useful, we'll start unlocking hockey sticks,\" he said.\n\n\"Hockey stick growth\" is a term used to describe a growth curve that starts out flat and suddenly spikes, mirroring the shape of a hockey stick.\n\nEmbiricos said there's no simple path to a fully automated workflow — each use case will require its own approach — but he expects to see progress toward this level of growth soon.\n\n\"Starting next year, we're going to see early adopters starting to hockey stick their productivity, and then over the years that follow, we're going to see larger and larger companies hockey stick that productivity,\" he said.\n\nSomewhere in between the time early adopters start to see gains in productivity and when tech giants manage to fully automate processes with AI agents is when we'll see AGI, Embiricos said.\n\n\"That hockey-sticking will be flowing back into the AI labs, and that's when we'll basically be at the AGI,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "A 1,000-strong \"dark fleet\" of rogue oil tankers skirting sanctions has emerged as a new target for the U.S. and Ukraine, a senior maritime intelligence analyst claims.\n\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann warned the aging fleet poses geopolitical risks and threats of $1 billion oil spills, with the recent U.S. seizures in Venezuela and Ukrainian drone strikes in the Black Sea marking a turning point for both nations in their efforts.\n\n\"There are about 1,000 vessels worldwide that are trading sanctioned crude tankers containing sanctioned Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil,\" Bockmann told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These vessels are a lifeline for these regimes, because they’re used for shipping oil to fund the war in Ukraine, and also give money to the illicit Maduro regime,\" she added.\n\nIran Backs Maduro To Keep Latin America Foothold As Trump Increases Pressure On Venezuela\n\n\"This is a brand-new problem for the U.S., and now Ukraine has signaled they are going to target these vessels the same way,\" she said. \"There is a new strategy to deal with this dark fleet, which is the lifeline of sanctioned oil revenues, and now under attack by the U.S. and Ukraine. The strategy is all to counter what we call gray-zone aggression.\"\n\nUs Escalation With Maduro Halts Deportation Flights To Venezuela\n\nRecent Ukrainian naval drone strikes have disabled several tankers in the Black Sea, including the Dashan, part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet that Ukraine says helps Moscow export oil in defiance of sanctions, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It is dangerous and could be interpreted as a form of gray-zone aggression in order to continue to keep oil revenue flowing,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"This is all a billion-dollar oil spill catastrophe waiting to happen,\" she added, pointing to the environmental and navigational risks posed by poorly maintained, uninsured ships.\n\nVenezuela Mobilizes Troops, Weapons In Response To Us Warship Buildup In Caribbean\n\nShe said a subset of \"about 350 to 400 vessels at any one time are not only sanctioned but falsely flying flags, which is dangerous,\" because false registration leaves vessels stateless and uninsured, putting crews at risk.\n\n\"This is a huge issue for maritime safety, it’s a menace to the environment, and it entails crew welfare,\" Bockmann said.\n\nThese vessels, she said, are typically \"elderly\" and used solely for sanctioned oil trades. Many also \"manipulate AIS\" to show they are in one place when they are actually elsewhere.\n\nTrump Sends World's Most Powerful Warship To Latin America — Historic Echoes Of Regime Change\n\n\"They use false flagging, but also spoofing and manipulating its AIS to show it's in one place when it's not. These vessels have also gone to fraudulent registries that don't exist, which means they have no insurance,\" she said. \"Their certificates of seaworthiness are invalid, and they have relied on international maritime conventions to have what's called the ‘right of innocent passage’ so they can't get intercepted.\"\n\nBockmann said U.S. forces have used legal tools including Article 110 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows boarding of stateless vessels, to stop these ships.\n\n\"It's my belief that they used Article 110, and they got on board that vessel, and they were absolutely entitled to remove that vessel from global trade,\" she said.\n\nVenezuela Accuses Us Of 'Piracy' After Seizing Massive Oil Tanker\n\nIn the Caribbean, U.S. forces recently seized the tanker Skipper, sanctioned in 2022 and found to be masking its location, under a federal warrant as part of a broader campaign to disrupt illicit oil shipping.\n\n\"The recent Venezuelan tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of oil uninsured, so that's a billion-dollar maritime disaster waiting to happen,\" Bockmann said.\n\nAs reported by Fox News Digital, Dec. 12 saw Attorney General Pam Bondi frame the U.S. seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker as a sanctions-enforcement action rooted in a federal court warrant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Black Sea, Ukraine targeted multiple alleged \"shadow fleet\" tankers with sea drones, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The three tankers that have been targeted by Ukraine are all in ballast, which means that they weren't carrying oil,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"That was carefully chosen, and they were also falsely flagged, just like in the recent case of the three tankers attacked in Ukraine. That flag was Gambia. In the U.S. case of Skipper, the flag was Guyana,\" Bockmann said.\n\nFox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "As our blended family grew, our holiday traditions shifted — from expanding Christmas to embracing new rituals that match who our kids are today.",
    "fullText": "Cookie baking, decorating, stuffing stockings, building a holiday village scene with Iron Man and Thor action figures — just like a huggable snowman discovered, everyone has traditions for that time of year.\n\nWe're a blended family with kids ranging in age from 17 to mid-30s. As our kids have moved from being wide awake at 5:30 am to testing Santa to creating their own holiday magic as adults, our traditions have grown and changed with them. As a result, it's all less stressful.\n\nRight around Thanksgiving, I am reminded that it's not just wonderful, it's also a wacky and wearisome time of the year.\n\nI grew up in blended families. By middle school, both of my parents had remarried, doubling the number of families to see during the festive season. By the fifth stop on a whirlwind Christmas Day in high school, my brother and I were stuffed with cookies and even burned out on opening presents.\n\nFor most of our 20-year marriage, I've felt like I'm reliving those teenage years all over again as we try to squeeze in his family, my multiple families, and the kids' other family commitments into two overstuffed days of festive cheer.\n\nAs the kids got older and added commitments to their significant others and time for their own families, we realized Christmas is too short. Two days were just not enough time to cram in all the festivities and have at least a little time left for our family.\n\nSo, some years, we celebrate what we call \"Christmas Tweve,\" the day before Christmas Eve. We spend most of the day hanging out, having a festive feast, and then opening gifts. Sometimes we have a houseful overnight, and everyone stays up late watching Christmas movies and eating my feeble attempts at pancake art for breakfast.\n\nWe are down to two kids living at home, and the number of holiday decorations has reduced.\n\nOne year, we had multiple trees, each decorated in a different theme — a candy-themed 5-foot tree, a mini tree in the kids' rooms, and a fancy ornament 7-foot tree.\n\nThere were two Christmas villages, one in the kitchen. The kitchen and living room looked like Christmas exploded in them. Every room had a few decorations — a tree, figurines, holiday towels, and a wreath on the door.\n\nThere was a time when seven of us were decorating. Now it's down to four, and we're focusing more on the nostalgic and sentimental decorations. Our tree is covered in ornaments from places we've traveled and the kids created.\n\nI used to frame the sliding door in our kitchen with the kids' artwork - cotton-ball snowmen, sparkly handprint reindeer, and a painted winter scene.\n\nA few years ago, my youngest and I had a holiday moment of tension when I displayed elementary school artwork with their previous name. They're nonbinary, and it bothered them seeing that name plastered all over the kitchen.\n\nI got creative and modified my favorites — erasing letters, trimming corners, and folding back edges. Now I display favorites onl,y and it's down to one wall shared with our Advent calendar.\n\nWhen the kids were younger, we had multiple Advent calendars — one with treats and one with toys. One year, it was Disney Tsum Tsums, there was \"Star Wars\" Lego, and then socks. A few years ago, no one was really interested, and we got one for the dog.\n\nNow, our Advent calendar is a meaningful tradition. It's the same one each year, and this year, my youngest helped shop for the candy, hopefully marking the start of a new tradition.\n\nWhen she was in college, my stepdaughter started making an annual ornament with a silly picture of herself. The perfect gift on a tight budget — inexpensive and very meaningful.\n\nNow she's a mom, married, and decorating her own place. Every year, my husband, the two youngest kids, and I put all 11 ornaments she's created on the tree — her with Chipotle burritos, in a snow globe, and with her son.\n\nA few years ago, our oldest came to stay when his spouse was out of town. I put him and his two younger siblings in charge of the holiday village.\n\nWhen I heard my youngest rummaging through their toys, I knew the holiday village was going to have a different vibe than it had in past years. Lego minifigs, Power Rangers, and assorted superheroes perched on festive rooftops and hid in the snow.\n\nEvery stage of our kids' lives means something new. Sometimes it's capped with a major milestone, such as a driver's license, wedding, or graduation, as a reminder to stop and savor this time.\n\nWith the holidays, there wasn't a big event to mentally prepare for the change. Gradually, things were different — gone were the days of classroom holiday party crafts and a big group decorating the tree. Now it's crafts from doggy day care, Christmas Tweve, and Spider-Man in the village. And I love it.",

    "description": "The cheapest ticket to attend the USA's opening 2026 World Cup match against Paraguay is $1,120 — a steep jump from initial estimates shared in 2018.",
    "fullText": "It's been over 30 years since Americans have had the chance to watch their national soccer team play on their home turf.\n\nThey'll get another chance next year, but it'll cost them.\n\nFans could pay over $2,700 for a ticket to watch the USA's first match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup against Paraguay, which is scheduled to take place in June at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nThat far exceeds the estimated ticket prices included in the original joint bid submitted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to host the World Cup.\n\nFIFA, which sets ticket prices, says it is using variable pricing to determine ticket costs, and \"may adjust ticket prices throughout the sales phases based on a review of demand and availability for each match.\"\n\nThe organization said it isn't using dynamic pricing — when ticket prices change in real time based on demand and other factors — for the 2026 World Cup. In addition to third-party sites like StubHub, which sell tickets, FIFA offers a resale and exchange marketplace for fans.\n\nFIFA launched its third phase of ticketing last week. Soon after the portal opened, fans took to social media, expressing shock over what they described as steep prices.\n\nWorld Cup tickets are divided into four categories, with Category 1 selling the most expensive tickets and Category 4 the cheapest options.\n\nAs of Saturday, there are no available Category 4 tickets for the USA's opening match against Paraguay on June 12. Instead, the cheapest ticket is selling for $1,120 under Category 3. The most expensive ticket costs $2,735, followed by $1,940.\n\nThe most expensive ticket for Mexico's opening match against South Africa costs $2,355, and Canada's opening match costs $2,170. Neither of those matches is offering Category 4 tickets.\n\nAs the tournament continues, ticket prices drop but are typically still far above original estimates.\n\nWhen the USA faces off against Australia on June 19, the most affordable ticket is $265, while the most expensive is selling for $700. When the USA plays on June 25, fans will have to pay between $910 and $340.\n\nThose prices are a far cry from what the United States, Canada, and Mexico estimated in their bid to host the tournament. The countries submitted a combined bid — dubbed the \"United bid\" — and were selected in 2018.\n\nIn their pitch, the countries estimated that a Category 1 ticket for an opening match would cost $774, followed by $614 for Category 2, $320 for Category 3, and $60 for Category 4.\n\nTickets for the final match were estimated to cost between $1,550 and $128. Under FIFA, the current final match prices — held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — start at $4,185. The most costly ticket is $8,680.\n\nDespite the hefty price, fans eager to snag tickets in this phase can purchase them now until January 13.\n\nThe 23rd edition of the tournament will take place this summer in 16 cities across North America. The first game kicks off on June 11, and teams will play until the final match on July 19.",

    "title": "Critical Role's cofounders say they faced 3 big challenges making their new Prime Video series",
    "description": "\"Mighty Nein\" is the Critical Role crew's second animated series project with Amazon.",
    "fullText": "The eight cofounders of the nerdworld business Critical Role came roaring back to Prime Video with the November debut of \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\nThe business's eight cofounders first started out streaming their home \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game on Twitch. Then, in 2019, CR raised seed funding of over $11.3 million to create the animated series \"The Legend of Vox Machina.\"\n\n\"The Mighty Nein,\" based on their second Twitch-streamed \"D&D\" campaign, is their second animated series on Prime Video.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider in November, the cofounders outlined some of the biggest challenges they faced — and the lessons they learned — making the show.\n\n\"The largest challenge was trying to figure out how we were going to reorganize, and how we introduced the world,\" Critical Role CEO Travis Willingham said.\n\nConverting a 141-episode campaign into a show for Prime Video meant covering lots of on-stream ground, Willingham said. The team had to make a \"massive shift\" in how characters and plot points were introduced.\n\n\"For us, the livestream campaign was so good at sort of feeding one little nugget at a time, and the world got bigger and bigger and bigger. We thought it was far more effective to just hit you with the larger pieces at play and let those things sort of inform the characters and the storylines as you go along,\" Willingham added.\n\nWillingham said these hints set the stage for more developments down the road.\n\n\"We are going to sort of peel back the layers of that onion as we go along,\" Willingham said. \"But we are certainly taking our time and saving things for season two as well. So we're not in a rush.\"\n\nCofounder Sam Riegel told Business Insider that the crew's longtime game master, Matthew Mercer, had created an \"incredible continent filled with politics and socioeconomic strife and war, and ruin, and religious exploration.\"\n\n\"To show all of the antagonists, the villains, the political intrigue that's going on around our characters, we needed a whole other plot line to show what was going on in the background,\" Riegel said.\n\nRiegel added that another key challenge with the \"Mighty Nein\" was the complexity of some of the main characters' backstories.\n\n\"We don't want to throw all those backstories in the audience's face right at the top, but we do want to tease out that they come with baggage and trauma and issues that they have to work through,\" Riegel said.\n\n\"Luckily, we were afforded hourlong episodes in which to do so, and I think it paints a rich tapestry,\" Riegel said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercer wove in information and plot points from the campaign that even Twitch viewers back in the day weren't aware of. That included more information on the series' key antagonists, the wizard Volstruckers, and the mysterious and enigmatic academic, Essek Thelyss, whom Mercer voices.\n\n\"We had the opportunity to dig in with the writer's rooms and the rest of the creative team to collaborate on how best to see that now fleshed out and shown and explored with the audience through this animated series,\" Mercer said. \"So there weren't too many changes. A lot of it was mainly just taking what was there or things that were sitting in my head and going, 'Alright, now we get to actually show this. That's really cool and exciting. Let's do it.'\"\n\nOne of the big challenges the team had to overcome was articulating the intricate aspects of an in-game world through animation. And that spanned character costumes and memorable campaign locations.\n\n\"When I sent Matt (Mercer) my idea of where Jester grew up and what the Lavish Chateau was, I had this strong visual in my mind,\" cofounder and cast member Laura Bailey said, referring to her character, the trickster cleric Jester.\n\n\"And then to see it in the animated series, it's so strange that they can capture exactly what it was that we've visualized for so long, and now everybody else gets to see these stunning set pieces that have existed only in this little world,\" Bailey added.\n\nCofounder Taliesin Jaffe said that he'd been \"very, very specific\" as well about how the carnival his character, Mollymauk Tealeaf, traveled with — should be animated.\n\n\"I'm famous for making very easy-to-animate character designs — I say deeply sarcastically,\" Jaffe joked.\n\nThe Critical Role team also had to look into how each character's magic was represented on-screen. For Liam O'Brien, it was crucial that his wizard, Caleb Widogast, cast magic in a manner that resembled a \"learned science,\" complete with alchemy and specific components.\n\nThe crew, O'Brien said, was also just happy to have the \"luxury of time\" to go back and revisit moments from their old \"D&D\" campaign.\n\n\"I am in love with the complicated world that this show has created — and that Sam and Travis have helmed — as we've all, in an all-hands effort, just created everything with love,\" O'Brien said.",

    "description": "Leon Spencer, an Australian dad, wants his kids to meet up with friends in person, not become products for advertisers.",
    "fullText": "The number of times my 11-year-old daughter has asked to join Messenger Kids has jumped noticeably this year.\n\nI've always believed I had good grounds to refuse, but to her, it's just a way to chat with friends. What's the harm? I've tried explaining how one app can lead to others, and how dependence on digital platforms can form quickly at her age.\n\nNow, with Australia's new ban on certain social media platforms for kids under 16, I can point to something more concrete: It's against the law.\n\nHere's the thing, though: the Messenger Kids platform isn't actually banned under the new legislation. Not yet anyway, even if its older sibling, Facebook, is. But the social media ban provides parents like me with a new reference point that normalizes our decision to say no.\n\nI'm not a Luddite. As an editorial lead for a media and communications agency in Australia, I work with content designed for social media platforms. Technology is key to what I do, and I understand the value of it, including social media platforms.\n\nBut we all know these apps are designed to be addictive and to keep users — including children — scrolling. Research increasingly shows links to declining mental health and even potential effects on brain development.\n\nI was concerned that the peer pressure to allow my children to join social media could make the decision to say no much harder than it ought to be. I'm hoping the ban will make it easier.\n\nI have two kids, 11 and 8. I don't want them to get into the habit of using social media platforms to interact with friends. I want them meeting friends in person or calling them, not becoming products for advertisers.\n\nMy children sometimes use my WhatsApp account for video calls with friends and family. Occasionally, they'll watch an Instagram reel with Mum on her phone. But I think it's important for most of their peer group interaction to occur at playdates, at school, or around the local neighborhood.\n\nI live on the Sunshine Coast, in Queensland, a part of Australia that lends itself to a rich outdoor lifestyle, year-round. It's easy for me to let my kids walk down the street to the park or visit friends nearby without constant adult supervision.\n\nAmong the other parents I speak with, the ban is a welcome shift in our relationship with social media platforms.\n\nTaking social media out of the equation completely also means less overall screen time. I'm good with this. Less screen time means less passive consumption and more active play. Yes, my kids get bored. But wait a little while, and they always find interesting things to do.\n\nRecently, after complaining for the better part of an hour about having to turn off the TV, my kids took themselves off and created a play. They wrote a script, rehearsed the lines, dressed in costumes, and performed.\n\nIt wouldn't have happened if the screen had stayed on.",

    "description": "Heath Kitson and William Lu planned a trip to Bali to learn surfing after getting laid off from their bank jobs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Heath Kitson and William Lu, who worked at ANZ Bank in the company's Melbourne office. The essay has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHeath Kitson: I managed a team of data analysts, and I was at ANZ for seven years before I was laid off a couple of months ago.\n\nWilliam Lu: I was at the bank for eleven years, and I reported to Heath.\n\nI've always said to people that it's been one of my dreams to be made redundant and enjoy some time off, but when it actually happens, it hits you hard. Part of me still thought that maybe I should just try to make an effort to find another role here. But then, toward the end of the consultation process, I had this overwhelming feeling, like Heath, that the change of strategy and direction meant that the exciting work we were doing was now over. It felt like a time to reset.\n\nKitson: We both got generous payouts, and the layoff did not hit us financially, and won't for a while. But it's definitely been a change — ever since I started work 20 years ago, I haven't even been out of work for even two weeks.\n\nLu: I haven't dived into looking for other roles yet. I'm fairly confident in the networks I have and the people I know, so I'm sure I'll be able to find somewhere warmer to go.\n\nKitson: Our outplacement service had a recruiter who had spent his career talking to executives in my position. He said that job hunting is a very deflating experience.\n\nHis advice was not to try to job hunt for eight hours a day and really grind yourself down, only to arrive at an interview all flat and disillusioned. He suggested spending only two hours a day looking for work and using the rest of the time to do whatever would make me feel happy and refreshed. He said we should be signaling to future employers: 'I'm the freshest I've ever been, I can't wait to start, I'm back from a trip.'\n\nIt reinforced to me that a break was not just part of the long service leave that was given to me, but also something that would help me get my next role. Even when I've changed jobs in the past, the companies have wanted me to start right away.\n\nLu: My outplacement experience wasn't as profound. My guy started the motions and informed me about the services available to me and the workshops I should attend. I was the one to say: 'Hold on, I'm not ready to think about this yet. Can we reconvene in February?'\n\nThe longest break I've had was when I went on my wedding and honeymoon, which lasted three weeks, so this period of paid leave was very welcome.\n\nKitson: When I started looking into how I wanted to spend my break, I knew I wanted to do something active. So I was thinking skiing, hiking, surfing, or those CrossFit camps. The goal was to find something that energizes me and to come back in better shape than when I left. I did not want to sit around drinking or being hungover for seven days and coming back more tired.\n\nLu: Heath and I had never hung out outside work at this point, but we were on a call one day after we were let go, when Heath shared that he wanted to go somewhere but did not have someone to go with. I told him that my wife also suggested taking a trip, and I would be up to go with him. We were just exchanging ideas when a surf camp in Bali came up.\n\nFor me, it was about experiencing something new as well. I've been surfing before, but to go seven days straight and have the opportunity to actually develop that skill properly, I think that was probably what got me over the line.\n\nKitson: I probably would've come on my own if we couldn't have worked something out together. But part of the appeal of this place was that we were coming to a community where we'd meet other people.\n\nLu: It didn't take too much to convince me, but the thought did cross my mind if it was a really good idea to travel with my ex-boss. But we've always had a good relationship and a lot in common.\n\nKitson: We just got back from our first session this morning, and I felt like I was not thinking about things back home and could focus on the waves. I've had a couple of sleepless nights over the past few weeks, but I think I'll sleep well tonight.\n\nLu: I wasn't thinking about work either. When part of you is just slightly worried about drowning, I don't think you can really think about too much.\n\nKitson: Our families were pretty happy to have us out of the house, since we'd gone pretty stir crazy. From friends and other coworkers, there was a little bit of friendly jealousy when they heard, and quite a few people wanted to come along. Lots of people asked us when we're doing the next one.\n\nLu: It's only our first day here, but I definitely could come again. There was quite a bit of work leading up to it, like getting visas and SIM cards. But as soon as we got on the plane, I was completely relaxed.\n\nKitson: I've thought already that if I get a job offer with a longer runway, I would go and do something similar again. I like that at surf camp, my day-to-day schedule is planned, and I can switch off about where to go and having to cook or go out to eat. It's different from a family beach vacation, which lacks this sense of freedom and rest because you're planning your own schedule and looking after the kids.\n\nLu: It's the same for me, since it's usually me who does all the planning.\n\nKitson: I'd suggest that anyone in a similar situation maintain their routines back home, but also try to take a short, refreshing break like this while waiting for things to happen on the job front.\n\nAre you based in Asia-Pacific and have a story to share about dealing with layoffs?

    "fullText": "The parent company of Roomba, which has sold millions of cleaning robots, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday after 35 years of operation.\n\nIn a Sunday press release, Massachusetts-based robotics company iRobot said it had filed for bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware court.\n\nThe company said that it would be wholly acquired by its main manufacturer and lender, vacuum cleaner maker Shenzhen PICEA. Picea has R&D and manufacturing facilities in China and Vietnam, per the release.\n\nThe Picea deal would allow iRobot to continue operating, developing new products, make \"timely payments to vendors and creditors,\" and meet its commitments to employees, the release said.\n\nUnder the deal, iRobot will be a private company owned by Picea, and its common stock will be wiped from stock exchanges.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company introduced the Roomba, its iconic disc-shaped vacuuming robot, in 2002.\n\nThe bankruptcy deal follows several quarters of weak sales and a cash crunch. The company wrote in its third-quarter earnings report that, as of September 27, its cash totaled $24.8 million, compared to $40.6 million as of June 28.\n\niRobot said it had withdrawn $5 million in restricted cash on September 27, after which it had \"no sources upon which it can draw for additional capital.\"\n\nIts third-quarter revenue, $145.8 million, was about a 25% drop compared to the same period the year before, with sales dropping 33% in the US.\n\nLast month, the company warned that the last possible iRobot buyer had backed out of a deal, which left it likely to pursue bankruptcy.\n\niRobot went through a failed acquisition attempt by Amazon. In 2022, Amazon announced that it would buy iRobot for $1.7 billion, but pulled the deal in January 2024, citing regulatory hurdles in the US and Europe.\n\nThe collapse of the Amazon deal hit iRobot hard. On the same day as Amazon's announcement, iRobot said it would lay off 31% of its staff, and its CEO, Colin Angle, would step down.\n\niRobot's stock price has dropped more than 50% in the past year and more than 90% in the past five years.",

    "fullText": "An X user recorded a Tesla Model Y driving through Austin's streets on Sunday that appears to show no one, not even a safety monitor, inside.\n\nSince Tesla launched its robotaxi in Austin in June, the driverless cars have always included a human in the passenger seat.\n\nThe video generated a fair amount of excitement online from Tesla watchers, some of whom immediately went to their app to order a robotaxi to see whether it would include a safety monitor (they did).\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk later said on Sunday that the company is now testing driverless taxis without human safety operators, though it appears not yet on actual paying customers.\n\n\"Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,\" Musk wrote in response to the X user who posted the original video.\n\nTesla itself responded to the video with \"Just saying.\"\n\nTesla's AI chief, Ashok Elluswamy, also responded. \"And so it begins!\" he wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nA driverless Tesla Robotaxi was spotted on the roads of Austin, Texas today.No one in the car. No safety driver.Fully autonomous.This is actually happening. pic.twitter.com/MSmRaeyJwj\n\nAccording to Robotaxi Tracker — run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna — there are 31 active vehicles in Austin, up from 29 in November. Speaking on the \"All-In\" podcast in October, Musk said that Tesla was aiming to increase its robotaxi fleet to 500 cars in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nMusk said in a video call at an xAI \"hackathon\" event last week that Tesla would remove human safety monitors from its robotaxi cars by the end of the year, according to Teslarati, a news site focused on Musk-run companies.\n\n\"There will be Tesla robotaxis operating in Austin with no one in them, not even anyone in the passenger seat, in about three weeks,\" Musk said, the outlet reported.\n\nWhen Business Insider tested a robotaxi in Austin in July, it required multiple interventions from the safety monitor in the passenger seat, including at one point when the car went the wrong way on a one-way street.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Jennifer McGuire was afraid of waiting around for her four adult sons to visit, so she booked a solo trip to Italy, France, and Northern Ireland.",
    "fullText": "I never used to know what kind of pizza I liked. A small but strangely telling detail about my life.\n\nI was always the adult ordering for me and my four sons — usually an extra-large cheese, maybe pepperoni if I felt wild. Economical crowd-pleasers. Perfect for our family, and for a single mom who didn't have the time to think about her own preferences.\n\nMaybe that's part of why I moved to Europe alone after my youngest left for college. I wanted to figure out what I liked on my pizza.\n\nOf course, it was more than that. I'd romanticized long stretches in Europe for years. I used to dream about Italy and France when I was deep in the trenches of motherhood, when a trip to the grocery store felt like an expedition, and the school parking lot was as far as I ever got.\n\nEurope felt impossibly distant from our small town. At that point in my life, even getting to the airport felt too far.\n\nBut when the time came, as afraid as I was to go, I was more afraid of staying put — of waiting for my kids to visit so I could feel like a person again.\n\nDetermined not to let fear stop me, I booked my first flight to Rome with my tax return. I packed my laptop so I could work remotely, a blessing that meant I could rent a place of my own.\n\nFirst, a tiny studio in the old town of Tivoli, just outside Rome. Then a month in Avignon in the south of France. Then Belfast in Northern Ireland. My choices were based almost entirely on friends' recommendations and the cheapest monthly Airbnbs I could find. I knew so little about the world beyond our house in Canada. I just wanted to go and see.\n\nFor the next six months, I learned how to be a person in the world without my \"mom\" qualifier. I learned how to make friends on my own — not mom friends or work friends, but actual friends.\n\nIn Italy, I joined a local hiking group and met a woman who became my closest Italian friend. Every day we walked and translated for each other until my Italian improved. Another shock: learning a new language in middle age.\n\nI felt foolish and more like myself at the same time.\n\nI walked everywhere. I learned how to be quiet inside — riding trains, gazing out the windows, wandering through museums, and drinking wine.\n\nIn the mornings, I took my coffee to the local courtyard to watch kids play soccer, women fill water at the fountain, and men play bocce. I embraced every cliché without a hint of embarrassment.\n\nI missed my kids, enough that I considered flying home at least a dozen times. But missing them somewhere new felt easier than missing them in our small town. Back home, I felt left behind. Leaving for my own adventure made me feel like I was choosing myself again.\n\nWhen I left Italy for Avignon, something softened. I already spoke a little French, which helped, and the city itself was easy to navigate. Each café and tiny shop felt like a gentle invitation.\n\nI met empty-nester moms everywhere — women who linked arms on their way to lunch and insisted I come along. They were building new lives while keeping their children at the center of their attention. I recognized myself in them.\n\nThat's what I learned in those six months: I could build a new life, return to an old version of myself, and still carry my mother-ness with me. I could be all of those people at once. I could still grow.\n\nIn Belfast, I wrote. I hiked Cave Hill with new friends and often by myself. I took a bus to the Giant's Causeway and ate fish chowder by the sea.\n\nEach day I chose something new and something familiar — yoga classes in the Cathedral Quarter, music nights at the Sunflower Pub, a book by the fire in White's Tavern on Sunday afternoons.\n\nAnd I wrote and wrote and wrote — an entire book — because finally I had the time and the quiet to write one. Because I felt like I was stepping into my own life for the first time in a long time.\n\nAt the end of my trip, I flew my sons over for a two-week visit. We went back to Rome, and I showed them everything — the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, all the obvious highlights. But more than that, I introduced them to the woman I'd become. A mom, yes, but also a friend, a hiker, a writer.\n\nAnd a lover of all kinds of pizza.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "description": "In a lawsuit challenging an Australian law barring children under 16 from having social media accounts, Reddit argues it's not a social media company.",
    "fullText": "A new law barring children under 16 from opening or maintaining social media accounts took effect last week in Australia, forcing platforms to deactivate accounts for swaths of young users.\n\nIn the words of Taylor Swift, however, Reddit would very much like to be excluded from this narrative because, it says, it's not a social media platform.\n\nReddit made the argument in a lawsuit it filed against the Commonwealth of Australia and its Minister of Communications on Friday. The Australian law is meant to protect young people from what it says are the harmful and addictive effects of social media use.\n\nReddit is seeking to overturn the country's new law, which it says \"infringes the implied freedom of political communication.\"\n\nAs part of the legal filing, Reddit also pushed back at being labeled an \"age-restricted social media platform\" within the meaning of Australia's law.\n\nInstead, Reddit said it \"operates as a collection of public fora arranged by subject.\"\n\n\"That is because it is not the case that the sole purpose, or a significant purpose, of Reddit is to enable 'online social interaction' between two or more end-users,\" the company said in its 12-page legal filing.\n\nThe company added that, in most cases, users don't know each other's real identities.\n\n\"Reddit does not import contact lists or address books. The 'upvote/downvote' functionality enables users to indicate how helpful they found the information that was posted by an end-user,\" the company said in the lawsuit. \"It is not intended to be used as a way for users to express any view about the poster themselves. In this way, Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become 'friends' with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events.\"\n\nReddit, founded in 2005, allows users to post and reply to those posts on \"subreddits\" dedicated to almost any topic imaginable. Users have the option to upvote or downvote posts and can send each other direct messages. While Reddit users can use their real names, most of them operate anonymously.\n\nThe company went public in 2024 with a valuation of $6.4 billion.\n\nReddit elaborated on its argument in a statement addressed to its users, which was shared on the platform last week.\n\n\"This law is applied to Reddit inaccurately, since we're a forum primarily for adults and we don't have the traditional social media features the government has taken issue with,\" the company said in the statement.\n\nAustralia's new law, which would place the onus on social media platforms to verify users' ages, has drawn criticism from other companies it targets as well, such as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.\n\nReddit, which says it is complying with the law, told its users that doing so could have unintended consequences.\n\n\"This law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't,\" the company said.\n\nAustralia isn't the only country considering restricting social media use among young people.\n\nMalaysia plans to ban children under 16 from having social media accounts in 2026. In Norway and Denmark, lawmakers have proposed laws that would ban social media accounts for children under 15.\n\nA handful of US senators earlier this year introduced the Kids Off Social Media Act, which would bar social media platforms from allowing children under 13 years old to create or maintain accounts. The act would also bar platforms from using algorithms to target children under 17.\n\n\"Australia is stepping up to protect kids from the addictive and harmful content being constantly fed to them on social media. It's now time for Congress to do the same and pass the Kids Off Social Media Act,\" Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a Democrat, said in a statement to Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "The person of interest detained in connection with the Brown University shooting, identified by law enforcement sources as Benjamin Erickson, is a decorated soldier who had served in a position at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nErickson, a 24-year-old Wisconsin native, served as an infantry soldier in the US Army, where he passed sniper training, had experience with firearms instruction and had served as a rifleman between 2021 and 2024, according to the profile.\n\nErickson also received a good conduct medal, participated in “security duties” near the president and assisted with funeral ceremonies at Arlington, the profile stated.\n\nThe LinkedIn page stated he planned to continue his college education at Brown University in the fall 2025 semester.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Army said Erickson had no deployments and left last year with the rank of specialist. Brown University did not immediately respond to questions about Erickson’s record.\n\nAuthorities said the person of interest was not a current student at Brown, but law enforcement sources indicated to CNN that he might have been recently enrolled.\n\nErickson took online classes with a focus on psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after graduating from high school in July 2020, and then transferred to Brown for this fall semester after his military service ended, according to the profile, which noted a variety of interests including animal welfare, veteran support and helping the poor.\n\nThe profile further noted that he had interned as a carpenter and helped out at a horse rescue center.\n\nA staff member at the rescue, the Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue in Maryland, told CNN that Erickson was part of an Army unit that learned horse handling techniques at the rescue center between 2023 and 2024. Erickson was training with the Caisson Detachment of the US Army’s 3d US Infantry Regiment, the staff member said – a unit that provides escorts for military and state funerals.\n\nA high school yearbook included a photo of Erickson on his school’s wrestling team. A profile on X that appeared to belong to Erickson posted in 2016 and 2017 about wrestling, music and political satire.\n\nOne of Erickson’s former high school classmates, Bryce Jankowski, said he recently exchanged texts with Erickson, who said he was studying at Brown.\n\n“He said he was doing good,” Jankowski said. “He said he was living at a hotel because his apartment flooded,” though he said that did not seem to bother him.\n\nJankowski described Erickson as a well-behaved, smart individual. He did not recall Erickson making any concerning statements, harboring extremist views or having any behavioral challenges. “He was wicked smart.”\n\nAfter high school, he said Erickson had told him that he was in sniper school with the US military.\n\nA former wrestling teammate from high school, who asked not to be quoted by name, described Erickson as a “pretty nice guy, he was quiet… he becomes really outgoing when you get to know him, but he’s pretty quiet when you don’t.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, CNN observed the FBI at a Wisconsin home owned by Erickson’s family.\n\nA search of court databases showed no clear criminal history for Erickson aside from a 2023 case in which he was cited for driving on a sidewalk, a charge that was dismissed.\n\nCNN’s Bill Kirkos, Thomas Bordeaux and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.",

    "description": "No matter where you live relative to the Arctic, the discovery will likely impact you.",
    "fullText": "A research team examined how increasing Arctic rainfall is driving significant changes — and the implications hit closer to home than some might think.\n\nThe researchers used climate model simulations to study how sea-ice retreat impacts summer rainfall patterns. The results, published in Geophysical Research Letters, showed that rainfall would increase by 17% if global temperatures rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, with 16% of the uptick attributed to sea-ice retreat.\n\nThis is because melting sea ice alters the \"white cold cap\" effect, weakening the region's ability to reflect solar radiation and thus pushing the Arctic toward a warmer, \"rain dominated\" water cycle, according to a Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) analysis published in Phys.org.\n\nResearchers from the CAS' Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Beijing Normal University, and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences also participated in the study.\n\nFirst author Yang Jiao explained that in the Arctic, animals that depend on sea ice for food and shelter, such as reindeer and polar bears, would \"face survival crises,\" per Phys.org. These crises would disrupt the region's ecological balance, which is vital for limiting disease spread and supporting the food web.\n\nAnd what happens in the Arctic wouldn't stay in the Arctic. Increased rainfall would accelerate permafrost thawing, releasing additional gases that warm the planet, per the study.\n\nWhile extreme weather phenomena occur naturally — and events can't be solely tied to a warming planet, as complex factors influence weather, per the NOAA — human activities are pumping billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere each year.\n\nThis has led to more intense extreme weather, according to scientific consensus. At home, this can mean sky-high insurance premiums, shortages of essential goods, and a higher risk of grid outages.\n\nThe researchers believe their insights into this critical climate issue could help in developing more accurate predictive models for Arctic weather.\n\n\"This study not only deepens our understanding of the warming and humidification processes in the Arctic, but also establishes a quantitative relationship model of 'sea ice-precipitation,' providing a powerful tool for enhancing the prediction capability of extreme weather and climate events in the Arctic,\" Yang said, per Phys.org.\n\nShould we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Former Grimsby Town and Barrow boss Michael Jolley has stepped down as manager of non-league side Bury after just two days following a backlash against his appointment.\n\nIt relates to an incident in 2009, when Jolley pleaded guilty to having sex with a 15-year-old girl.\n\nHe was sentenced to a year's probation and placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for 12 months.\n\nJolley has always maintained the girl did not disclose her true age to him, telling him she was 19. In a statement on X on Sunday, he said subsequent investigations established he was \"deceived, and at no time did I act maliciously\".\n\nHe has not been prevented from continuing his career in football and has worked at seven clubs since the incident, including two in the Football League.\n\nBury, who play in the eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One West, announced the 48-year-old's appointment on Friday.\n\nIt drew criticism on social media and Bury fans chanted for his removal as he watched Saturday's 2-1 win against Mossley in the stands at Gigg Lane. The away team's supporters also sang derogatory songs about him.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Bury said the club recognised \"the strength of feeling expressed in recent days by supporters, staff, partners and players, and the very real impact the board's decision to appoint Michael has had on individuals connected to the club\".\n\nThey included a statement from Jolley, which said: \"I do not wish my presence to deter the board from its mission of returning the club to its rightful place in the EFL.\"\n\nIn his statement on X, Jolley said his appointment had become a \"distraction\" for the club and he would \"relinquish the opportunity to become first-team manager\".\n\nBury said he had been \"relieved of his duties by mutual consent\".\n\nIn response, some fans called on board members to resign.\n\nBury said assistant manager Tim Lees would take charge of the side on an interim basis while the board undertakes \"a wider review of club operations\".\n\n\"We will also be engaging directly with players, staff and stakeholders to listen, learn and ensure that appropriate support is available,\" the club added.\n\n\"Our immediate priority is the welfare of our people and the stability of the club and our community.\n\n\"We believe this step is necessary to help restore confidence, create space for reflection and allow Bury FC to move forward in a way that reflects our values and responsibilities.\"\n\nThe club said it remained committed to \"acting with integrity, transparency and respect\".\n\nSamantha Harman - a Her Game Too ambassador for the club's supporters' group - said there had been no advance notice of Jolley's appointment.\n\n\"At the time the news was released, I was away with work and flew back immediately,\" Harman posted on X. \"I went straight to the game and made my feelings very clear to members of the board at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\"Since the announcement, I have had to manage the very real impact this decision has had on our volunteer base, including volunteers stepping down. This has been an extremely difficult situation to navigate.\n\n\"As volunteers, we are required to adhere to a social media policy, which limits our ability to publicly express personal feelings or opinions online.\n\n\"However, I want to be absolutely clear - the Her Game Too team at Bury FC was fully aligned with the concerns raised by supporters and did not stand by the decision made in this appointment.\"\n\nJolley was put in charge after Dave McNabb stepped down as manager earlier this month to become head of football operations.\n\nAnnouncing his appointment on Friday, a Bury statement said: \"Michael's blend of strategic expertise, coaching pedigree and global management experience makes him the right leader to inspire our squad and unite our supporters.\"\n\nIn his statement on X, Jolley said: \"I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work at seven fantastic professional clubs since 2009. On joining each of those clubs, I have always proactively raised this incident after being offered employment. All those clubs considered the evidence and reached their own judgement based on the facts.\n\n\"Now in 2025, 16 and a half years later, my CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] check has long since shown as clear but in the interests of transparency and openness, I still ensure that any prospective employers have visibility of the issue if I do receive any offer of employment, and I did so once again in my discussions with Bury FC.\n\n\"If prospective employers wish to view the evidence or character references that were heard in court in 2009, I also ensure these documents are made available to them.\n\n\"Football being what it is, I have become accustomed to being abused in stadia and online by people unwilling or unable to accept the facts. Since I have a clear conscience regarding the incident, I have always believed that it is right that I stand my ground in the face of the abuse I have received during my football career.\n\n\"However, now with a young family of my own who wish to attend matches and support the club, I naturally place their wellbeing above my own and take a different perspective on this issue.\"",

    "fullText": "On a weekend when Phil Foden and Cole Palmer helped Manchester City and Chelsea to vital Premier League victories, Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers showed just why he retains a firm grip on the number 10 position in Thomas Tuchel's England set-up.\n\nVilla's eight-match winning run in all competitions appeared under serious threat at the midway point of Sunday's game at third-bottom West Ham, who led 2-1 at the break against a side who appeared jaded and short of inspiration after Thursday's Europa League victory at Basel.\n\nIn the second half, however, Rogers decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored his first of the afternoon five minutes into the second half, making it 2-2 from close range after West Ham had failed to clear Youri Tielemans' low cross into the box.\n\nThen, with the final 10 minutes approaching, Rogers collected a loose ball 30 yards from goal and was given time and space to slam a powerful, swerving strike into the top right corner of Alphonse Areola's goal and clinch a ninth straight victory for Unai Emery's third-placed team.\n\nThat magnificent effort capped a fine all-round performance from Rogers and reaffirmed his status as England's first-choice number 10 at next summer's World Cup - despite world-class competition from Foden, Palmer and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham.\n\n\"He scored two fantastic goals and, for me, he is not just going to be in the squad next summer,\" said former England forward and Match of the Day pundit Theo Walcott. \"He is a dead cert to be a starter for England at the World Cup - 100%.\n\n\"He does everything, he's not just a goal threat. I like all [the contenders for the number 10 position], but one of them is going to have to miss out on the squad itself - and Rogers, for me, has to start.\"",

We should have more points, especially this season. So, I take that naturally.\n\n\"Sometimes they don't have all the information and see Manchester United with the standards they lived here, always winning. It's hard for them to see their club in this situation.\"\n\nAmorim rejects the theory the attacks make his job more difficult. His assessment is more simplistic.\n\n\"No,\" he added. \"Not winning is the issue.\n\n\"The problem is that me as a manager, I'm not doing good enough. That is a fact also and I can accept that. The only problem for them is that Manchester United is not winning and is not in the position that it's supposed to be.\n\n\"If you are winning, there is no issue.\"",
