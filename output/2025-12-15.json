    "description": "Halftime stumbles reveal Rockets' resilience. These third-quarter tests forge a stronger team, building crucial late-game composure and earning crucial April skills.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets have a third-quarter problem. Not every night, not in the same way, but often enough that it’s become part of the rhythm of their games. Leads shrink. Momentum swings. Opponents find life. And suddenly a game that felt controlled turns into something that has to be earned again.\n\nAnd here’s the thing — that’s not all bad.\n\nYoung teams usually fall apart early or late. They come out flat or panic in the fourth. Houston doesn’t do that. Their issue tends to show up right after halftime, when adjustments get made and the game asks a slightly different question. That’s a much better problem to have.\n\nThird quarters are where discipline gets tested. The game resets. The adrenaline dips. Coaches counter. This is where teams that rely on feel get exposed, and teams that rely on structure have to prove it. Houston is still learning how to answer that moment consistently, and that learning curve is showing up in real time.\n\nSometimes it’s shot selection. Sometimes it’s pace. Sometimes the defense gets a little too aggressive and loses its shape. But what matters is what happens after. The Rockets don’t spiral. They don’t unravel. They regroup.\n\nThat’s the part people gloss over.\n\nThis team has become one of the better closing groups in the league not because they never make mistakes, but because they respond to them. Third-quarter lapses force them to lock back in. They force communication. They force leadership moments. Those are reps you don’t get when everything goes smoothly.\n\nAnd over time, those reps matter more than clean box scores.\n\nIme Udoka has clearly allowed these moments to breathe instead of overcorrecting them. There’s trust baked into that. Trust that the group will feel it, adjust, and execute when the game actually needs to be won.\n\nEventually, the third-quarter issues will tighten up. Most teams figure that out with experience. But even now, the Rockets are learning something more valuable: how to steady themselves when control slips.\n\nThat’s not a December skill. That’s an April one.\n\nAnd when the margins shrink later in the season, Houston won’t be surprised by discomfort. They’ve already lived in it — and learned how to come out the other side.",

    "description": "Tracking every incoming and outgoing player from Washington in the transfer portal this cycle",
    "fullText": "This is your place to keep track of everything Husky related in the transfer portal this season. The portal still doesn’t officially open until January 2nd but there are already some Husky players who have announced their intention to enter once available (or that intention has been reported by reputable sources). There won’t be any official offers to players until we hit January 2nd but we’ll include updates from Max Vrooman’s transfer portal rankings with every player in the portal with a tie to Washington in some way.\n\nHusky Players Expected to Enter the Transfer Portal (4)\n\nHarris was a three-star recruit out of powerhouse Bishop Gorman HS in Las Vegas, NV. He committed to Jedd Fisch at Arizona but transferred to Washington when Fisch took the job at UW. As a freshman, Harris played 72 offensive snaps across 9 games to burn his redshirt although nearly half of them were in the Sun Bowl. He finished with 2 catches for 17 yards.\n\nThis year it appeared Harris was passed on the depth chart by freshmen Raiden Vines-Bright, Dezmen Roebuck, and Chris Lawson. He played 5 games and was needed more heavily late in the year due to injuries at the receiver position. Harris’s highlight as a Husky was a 61-yard TD against Purdue.\n\nThank you Husky Nation for everything! It’s always love! 💜 https://t.co/Jvv34PVCWr\n\n— Audric Harris (@audricharris2) December 3, 2025\n\nBryant was a three-star recruit out of St. John Bosco in the class of 2023. Over his first two seasons at Washington he played 64 snaps as a reserve. Opportunity opened up for Bryant as Washington lost almost their entire linebacker corps from 2024 to eligibility or the portal. Bryant stepped up and surprisingly won a starting spot, starting the Huskies’ first 10 games this season.\n\nBut it was clear that the path to playing time would be harder next season with Jacob Manu and Zaydrius Rainey-Sale both back following 2024 ACL tears plus Buddah Al-Uqdah coming back from injury and Xe’ree Alexander playing well down the stretch. There was no way that there would be enough playing time for all 5 next season and so Bryant is the first of the group to depart as the only one of the group not initially signed by the current coaching staff.\n\nFYI: Husky LB Devin Bryant is not with the team in LA. Planning to enter the transfer portal. \n\nAlso, G Geirean Hatchett has been granted a waiver by the NCAA and is planning on returning to UW next year\n\n— Dave “Softy” Mahler (@Softykjr) December 14, 2025\n\nMcCutcheon was a three-star recruit in the class of 2021 having originally committed to Jimmy Lake as the slot corner in Lake’s defense. Lake of course was out by the end of McCutcheon’s freshman year but he stuck around under Kalen DeBoer playing 84 snaps over his 2nd and 3rd seasons in the program. McCutcheon once again stayed at UW when Jedd Fisch came in and in 2024 played 254 snaps as the backup nickel corner. He was seemingly passed on the depth chart by Rahshawn Clark in the preseason though and then suffered a season-ending injury in the first month of the year before playing a snap. He is hoping to earn a medical waiver for 2026 and otherwise would be out of eligibility so his departure doesn’t change UW’s expected scholarship count.\n\nNEW: Washington cornerback Dyson McCutcheon plans to enter the transfer portal, @PeteNakos reports. \n\nThe son of former NFL player Daylon McCutcheon missed the 2025 season but played in 12 games in 2024. He's seeking a sixth year of eligibility.https://t.co/kSYG7dYADj pic.twitter.com/NUWNgFnu3F\n\n— Transfer Portal (@TransferPortal) December 14, 2025\n\nBoyajyan was a three-star recruit out of Clovis, CA in the class of 2024. He signed with Washington as his only P4 offer with Washington looking to replenish an offensive line that had absolutely no depth when Jedd Fisch took over in Seattle. Boyayjyan hadn’t seen the field yet through two seasons and didn’t appear likely to be one of the top 8 linemen for next season barring a huge leap in the offseason.\n\nWashington OL Davit Boyajyan plans to enter the portal.\n\nBoyajyan signed with the Huskies in 2024 out of Clovis (Calif.) North- redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining. https://t.co/kUwKSzhG03 pic.twitter.com/44zbh4JQ1L\n\n— Brandon Huffman (@BrandonHuffman) December 14, 2025\n\nTransfer Portal Rankings Dashboard\n\nYou can access the dashboard here (the spacing is better than the embedded version here).",

    "description": "Philip Rivers fought back tears as he considered what message it would send to his sons, or the young men he has coached, that he nearly led the Indianapolis Colts to victory at age 44.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers fought back tears as he considered what message it would send to his sons, or the young men he has coached, that he nearly led the Indianapolis Colts to victory at age 44.\n\n“There is doubt, and it’s real,” Rivers said, choking up briefly. “The guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is, ‘Shoot, let’s see what happens.’ I hope in that sense that can be a positive to some young boys, or young people.”\n\nRivers ended a nearly five-year retirement to start Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks and played efficient football for the desperate Colts, who turned to the future Hall of Famer after Daniel Jones was lost for the season with a torn Achilles tendon.\n\nHe threw a touchdown pass in the first half, played mostly mistake-free and moved the Colts into position for Blake Grupe’s 60-yard field goal with 47 seconds left. But Jason Myers responded with a 56-yarder that gave the Seahawks an 18-16 victory.\n\nIt was a remarkable day for a grandfather who’s spent the past few years coaching high school football in his native Alabama.\n\nRivers took a few hard hits from the Seahawks’ stout defense, and he even enjoyed them.\n\n“I never minded that part of it,” Rivers said. “My wife always tells me I’m crazy because there’s been times in the last three or four years I said, ‘I wish I could just throw one and get hit – hard.’”\n\nThis wasn’t a novelty act, as it may have seemed when the Colts signed the Pro Football Hall of Fame semifinalist to their practice squad less than a week ago. Coach Shane Steichen’s Colts, who began the season 7-1 but are trying to stop a second-half collapse, knew what they were getting out of the veteran.\n\nRivers finished 18 of 27 for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception, with the pick coming on his final pass as he tried to force the ball down the field in the closing seconds.\n\n“I was just thankful — grateful — that I was out there,” Rivers said. “And it was a blast — it was a blast — but obviously the emotions now are disappointment. This isn’t about me. We have a team scrapping like crazy to try and stay alive and get into the postseason.”\n\nThe Colts (8-6) have dropped four straight and five of six, and they are outside the AFC playoff picture with three games left. They trail both Jacksonville and Houston in the AFC South.\n\nSteichen called a conservative game, relying on running the ball and controlling the clock. Rivers threw mostly short passes to the outside, checkdowns and screens.\n\n“He went out there and gave us a chance to win it,” Steichen said.\n\nRivers took two sacks, and he showed his age on the first one. He stumbled while evading pressure from Boye Mafe, got up, then fell again.\n\nRivers pumped his right fist and let out a roar after throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to Josh Downs with 1:33 remaining in the first half to put the Colts up 13-3.\n\nIt was Rivers’ first touchdown pass since he threw a 27-yarder to Jack Doyle in the Colts’ 27-24 loss to Buffalo in a wild-card playoff game on Jan. 9, 2021. He also became the fifth player in NFL history to throw a TD pass at age 44 or older, joining Tom Brady, George Blanda, Steve DeBerg and Vinny Testaverde.\n\n“It’s been 1,800 days since I’ve thrown a touchdown — or interception for that matter. So we have both those (boxes) checked,” Rivers said.\n\nRivers was chosen last month as one of 26 semifinalists for the Hall of Fame’s class of 2026 but will now have his eligibility delayed. A player must be out of the league for at least five years before his candidacy can be considered. The earliest Rivers can be a candidate is for the class of 2031.\n\nHe ranks among the top 10 in NFL history in wins, attempts, completions, yards passing, touchdown passes and 300-yard games.\n\nSince his retirement, he’s been coaching at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama, where the team held a watch party on Sunday. Rivers’ players were on his mind as he returned to the NFL.\n\n“Maybe it will inspire or teach not to run or be scared of what may or may not happen,” Rivers said.",

    "description": "The Packers lost to the Broncos on Sunday. Here's what went right, what went wrong and what it means for the Packers moving forward.",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers gave up a 23-14 lead in the second half, lost several key players to injury and limped to the finish line of a 34-26 defeat at the hands of the Denver Broncos on Sunday at Empower Field at Mile High. Matt LaFleur's team had its four-game win streak snapped and is now 9-4-1, but the injuries to Micah Parsons and Christian Watson are the big story coming out of this defeat.\n\nHere's what went right, what went wrong and what it means for the Packers moving forward:\n\n-- Jordan Love was red hot in the first half, completing 17 of 21 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown as the Packers scored on their first four possessions.\n\n-- Josh Jacobs played through a right knee injury and produced 92 total yards and two big scores.\n\n-- Credit Edgerrin Cooper. There was no quit in him. He broke up a fourth down pass and had a tackle for loss on fourth down late in the fourth quarter, keeping the Packers alive. He finished with eight tackles, two for a loss and a pass breakup.\n\n-- The Packers run defense limited the Broncos to 2.9 yards per carry and didn't give up a run over eight yards.\n\n-- First-round pick Matthew Golden drew a pass interference penalty on a scoring drive, had a 27-yard catch, an 18-yard catch and an 11-yard catch converting a third down.\n\n-- Pretty much everything after Jordan Love threw a deep ball to Christian Watson with 12:46 left in the third quarter.\n\n-- The offensive line struggled post-Zach Tom. The passing game flat-lined post-Christian Watson. The defense couldn't rush Bo Nix post-Micah Parsons.\n\n-- The Packers defense gave up 23 completions, 304 passing yards and four touchdowns to Bo Nix, who wasn't sacked, didn't have a turnover and finished with a passer rating of 134.7. The secondary got burnt time and time again in big spots. The pass rush produced only three quarterback hits.\n\n-- The Broncos went 4-for-4 scoring touchdowns in the red zone. The Packers were 1-for-4 and settled for three field goals under 40 yards.\n\n-- Courtland Sutton tortured Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine to the tune of seven catches, 113 yards and one touchdown. The cornerbacks weren't good enough on Sunday.\n\n-- Love turned the ball over twice. On the first, he aggressively attacked downfield in a one-on-one opportunity with Christian Watson. On the second, he threw slightly behind Dontayvion Wicks. Both times, Love gave his receiver a chance to make a play. Neither was a perfect throw, and the Broncos made him pay. Denver scored seven points off two takeaways, Green Bay got only three points off one.\n\n-- The Packers were penalized 10 times for 72 yards. Many were completely avoidable infractions. Rasheed Walker was flagged four times.\n\n-- Given two opportunities with the ball down eight points in the fourth quarter, the Packers turned the ball over on downs on back-to-back possessions. Jordan Love took a sack on fourth down ending the first, and his pressured attempt on 4th-and-15 wasn't close to end the game.\n\n-- Xavier McKinney had three passes defensed, but he had two failed opportunities to make a game-changing interception right before Micah Parsons' noncontact injury.\n\nIt isn't hyperbole to say this defeat -- and everything that factored into it -- is season-altering for the Packers. Not only is Matt LaFleur's team now 9-4-1 and in second place in the NFC North, but losing Christian Watson and Micah Parsons to injuries significantly lowers the Packers' championship potential entering the final three games. In fact, if both are done for the season, the championship potential for Green Bay might be zero. Watson had supercharged the passing game. Parsons was the most important player on the team not named Jordan Love. They are indispensable players. The Packers might only need one more win to get into the postseason, but winning the division just got a lot more challenging, and it's extremely difficult to envision the Packers going on the road and winning three straight games without Watson and Parsons. It sure feels like an ascending team that was becoming title worthy just had the rug pulled out from under it in the most devastating way.\n\nSomehow, the Packers must shake off this loss, recover from a physical, injury-filled afternoon in the altitude in Denver, put together a game plan without several important pieces available and go into Chicago and beat the Bears -- who won on Sunday -- at Soldier Field on Saturday night. If the Packers want to win the NFC North and host a playoff game in January, winning next Saturday is a must. Big stakes involved in the rematch.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Breaking down Packers' 34-26 loss to Broncos: What went right, wrong",

    "description": "The Yankees are a finalist to sign one of the top free agent pitchers.",
    "fullText": "The Yankees never wanted to trade pitcher Michael King. They loved the right-hander when he was a multi-innings, high-leverage reliever at the start of his career and they loved him after he went into their rotation in August 2023.\n\nReluctantly, they had to do it.\n\nThat’s the only way the Padres would sign off on trading star outfielder Juan Soto during the 2023 Winter Meetings. King was the centerpiece of the Padres’ return in a blockbuster deal on Dec. 7, 2023 that sent Soto and center fielder Trent Grisham to New York for King, young pitchers Randy Vasquez, Jhony Brito and Drew Thorpe, and veteran catcher Kyle Higashioka.\n\nTwo years later, King is a free agent and the Yankees would like to get him back even though their loaded with starting pitching.\n\nAccording to the Boston Globe, King is considering signing with the Yankees and two of their AL East rivals, the Red Sox and Orioles. A Rhode Island native and Boston College alum, King has “strong interest” in signing with the Red Sox, MassLive reported.\n\nMLB Trade Rumors ranked King No. 14 on its list of top 50 free agents this offseason and predicted he’s get a four-year contract worth $80 million.\n\nIf the Yankees sign King, he could be in a season-opening rotation that includes All-Star left-hander Max Fried, 2024 AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil and a pair of right-handers who impressed as rookies this past season, Will Warren and Cam Schlitter.\n\nBut with All-Star left-hander Carlos Rodon expected to return from his offseason surgery by late April and former Cy Young winner Gerrit Cole due back from Tommy John surgery in May or June, the Yankees could follow a King signing by dealing one of their starters, perhaps Gil. Also, Clarke Schmidt is expected back late in the season from his Tommy John surgery,\n\nKing, 30, was 5-3 with a 3.44 ERA in 15 starts in an injury-plagued 2025 season with the Padres. He was on the IL from May 25 to Aug. 9 and from Aug. 14 to Sept. 9 with shoulder inflammation.\n\nFor his career, he’s 31-29 with a 3.24 ERA in 16 games, 64 as a starter.\n\nHis best season was 2024 when he was 13-9 with a 2.95 ERA in 31 games, 30 starts, for the Padres.\n\nKing began his career with the Yankees mostly pitching as a multi-inning, high-leverage reliever. From 2019 through 2023, he had a 13-17 record for the Yankees with a 3.38 ERA in 115 games, 19 as a starter.\n\nHere are other recent NJ.com Yankees posts to check out:\n\n-- Yankees add free agent bat for protection if Cody Bellinger moves on\n\n-- Yankees add cancer survivor for bullpen depth\n\n-- Yankees free agent finds new home\n\n-- Yankees fans mad about payroll?

    "title": "Who will Colts start at QB vs 49ers? What Philip Rivers, Shane Steichen said",
    "description": "What Colts coach Shane Steichen and quarterback Philip Rivers said about who will start vs 49ers next week",
    "fullText": "SEATTLE — From the way Shane Steichen and Philip Rivers are talking, it does not sound like there is much question about who the starting quarterback will be when the Colts take the field on ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” against the 49ers.\n\nRivers was clearly limited in Sunday’s 18-16 loss to the Seahawks, completing 18 of 27 passes for just 120 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\nBut the Colts liked the way he managed the game, avoided turnovers and gave Indianapolis a chance to win at the end, although the kickoff unit and the defense weren’t able to hold the lead.\n\n“Very encouraged,” Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said. “There's no question about it. For him to go out there and do what he did after five years off, to have a chance to win it and get a game-winning field goal, close to it, obviously, with 40 seconds left, in a hostile environment, against a tough defense just shows his commitment to coming back.”\n\nIndianapolis decided to roll the dice on a 44-year-old Rivers instead of sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard for several reasons.\n\nRivers’ experience, knowledge of the offense, ability to get the Colts into the right plays and encyclopedic knowledge of what defenses are trying to do gave him the edge over Leonard’s age and athleticism.\n\nLeonard completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards, no touchdowns and an interception in relief of Daniel Jones last week in Jacksonville, but Leonard is dealing with a reported PCL sprain in his right knee, although he was able to practice in full all week long.\n\nThe Colts wanted to see if Rivers could handle the rigors of an NFL game.\n\nFrom what they saw on Sunday, it looks like the 44-year-old can handle it, even being hit after five years away from the NFL.\n\n“I never minded that part of it,” Rivers said. “My wife always tells me I'm crazy because there's been times in the last three or four years I said I wish I could just throw one and get hit hard. She says, that's not normal. … The one where the ball was snapped didn't feel great, but the other ones kind of got me going in the game.”\n\nRivers acknowledged that the offense wasn’t very explosive on Sunday.\n\nBut he also talked like a quarterback who expects to start next week.\n\n“It's going to continue to get better,” Rivers said. “This is obviously the first one, we're talking about three days of practice.”\n\nRivers wasn’t entirely happy with his performance.\n\nOr the offense’s. Indianapolis scored 13 points in the first half, but the Colts were held scoreless in the second half until Blake Grupe’s go-ahead field goal with 47 seconds left, giving Indianapolis a one-point lead that Seattle erased in 25 seconds.\n\n“I'm speaking offensively,” Rivers said. “If I can stay healthy — like, I feel good — it's gonna get better as we go, but the catch in that is we gotta win. Doesn't really matter if it's getting better as we go, we gotta win, or it's going to be over in three weeks. That's the catch.”\n\nRivers was already talking like a quarterback thinking about ways the offense can be better.\n\nThe 44-year-old came back to the Colts in a Hail Mary attempt to get Indianapolis into the playoffs. He wants to see it through.\n\n“Certainly going to quickly turn my attention to the 49ers,” Rivers said. “I know they have a Monday night game (at Lucas Oil Stadium). I never got to experience that, either, in that COVID year. And we're going to scratch and fight and claw. I do know that. Not because I'm here. But I do know that any team I've ever been a part of, not because of me, but I've been a part of, will fight like crazy until they tell us the season is over. So you can guarantee that for the next three weeks.”\n\nJoel A. Erickson and Nathan Brown cover the Colts all season.

    "description": "How did the Saints upset the Panthers in Week 15's final seconds? By leaning on a young quarterback who continues to deliver when it matters most.",
    "fullText": "In dramatic fashion, the New Orleans Saints secured their second straight divisional win, edging the Carolina Panthers 20-17 to complete a season sweep. Now 4-10 on the year, New Orleans oddly finds itself 3-2 within the NFC South – effectively throwing a wrench into the plans of the teams jockeying for position at the top of the division.\n\nHow did they do it? By leaning on a young quarterback who continues to deliver when it matters most, paired with a defense that has fully embraced a bend-but-don’t-break identity — and broken through at the most critical moments.\n\nA lot went right once again for the Saints, but let’s break down this Week 15 statement win by answering four key questions:\n\nSimply put: a lot. The Saints showed resilience, composure, and timely execution en route to their second straight divisional victory – one that continues to complicate things for their rivals. At the center of it all was rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who once again proved capable of rising to the moment. After a relatively slow start — aside from an impressive 17-play, 95-yard touchdown drive — Shough took control in the second half. He completed 15 of 19 passes (excluding a late-game spike) and led the Saints on four consecutive scoring drives, three of which ended in points.\n\nWhat stood out most was his command in long down-and-distance situations. Shough converted seven throws on downs of 10+ yards, nearly adding an eighth on a 17-yard completion to DeVaughn Vele on second-and-18 that left the Saints just a yard short. A quick glance at the third-down numbers tells part of the story as well, with New Orleans converting six of 11 attempts.\n\nIt’s clear that Shough has injected confidence into this offense in moments that felt tight earlier in the season. It wasn’t perfect — nor does it need to be — but with Shough under center, the Saints are winning games, and he’s beginning to look more and more like a legitimate part of the franchise’s future. The defense also deserves significant praise. While far from dominant from start to finish, they came up with their biggest plays when it mattered most. Early in the fourth quarter, trailing by seven with Carolina driving, the Saints defense delivered a massive fourth-and-one stop, preventing the Panthers from extending their lead to double digits.\n\nTwo drives later, after forcing a three-and-out, defensive end Chase Young made perhaps the play of the game – sacking Bryce Young on first-and-10 after Carolina had just converted a critical third-and-long with under two minutes remaining. The sack swung momentum, forced a punt, and set the stage for the Saints’ game-winning drive. And finally, credit where it’s due – Charlie Smyth delivered. After connecting on a 42-yard field goal earlier, the rookie kicker calmly drilled a 47-yard game-winner with two seconds remaining, the first walk-off kick of his young career. Moments like that can define confidence for a young specialist.The vibes were as high as they’ve been in New Orleans all season.\n\nDespite the strong finish, the Saints once again struggled out of the gate offensively. Two early drives – a 3-play, 4-yard and 6-play, 17-yard drive drained early momentum from a crowd eager for a fast start. While the offense responded in the second half, slow starts like this can be costly against more complete opponents.\n\nThe defense faced similar issues early. Carolina scored on three of its first four possessions, consistently moving the ball on the ground and extending drives on third down. Credit the unit for tightening up after halftime, but the early lapses mirrored what we saw against Miami a few weeks ago – the difference this time was finishing the job.Faster starts on both sides of the ball would allow this team to build separation rather than fighting until the final whistle.\n\nThe Saints have officially made things interesting. With a rookie quarterback leading the way, New Orleans has rattled off back-to-back wins after once being projected to pick inside the top 3-5 of next year’s draft – with major questions still looming at quarterback. That narrative is starting to shift. If this upward trend continues, the Saints may pivot from searching for a quarterback to aggressively building around one. How they close out the final three games will go a long way in shaping the organization’s offseason approach.\n\nNext Sunday, the Saints return home to host the New York Jets – a matchup with real implications for draft positioning at the top of the board. That said, based on recent play, this is another winnable game for New Orleans and an opportunity to secure a third straight victory.\n\nFinishing the season strong may be the most important objective for this team moving forward. With a young quarterback instilling confidence across the roster, momentum matters — not just for the locker room, but for the veterans already in place and the free agents the organization will evaluate come March.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Instant analysis: What went right, what went wrong in Saints-Panthers",

    "fullText": "The Patriots entered Sunday 11-2 with a chance to clinch the AFC East with a win.\n\nThey started the game against the Bills looking like they’d have a great chance to do just that, going up 21-0 and taking a 24-7 lead into halftime.\n\nBut then things fell apart in the second half, with Buffalo going on to win 35-31.\n\n“I mean, we weren’t able to get any stops,” head coach Mike Vrabel said postgame, via transcript from the team. “When we had an opportunity to make a play, we weren’t able to make it. Penalties. And that’s how this game goes. A few small plays make the difference. We were very prepared for this team to — we were going to need 60 minutes to beat this team.\n\n“This is a good football team. We had a lot of good football in there. And we had a lot of plays that, a few plays we’d like to have back that we’ll have to learn from.”\n\nQuarterback Josh Allen specifically made plenty of second-half plays — which was no surprise from the reigning MVP. He finished the contest 19-of-28 passing for 193 yards with three touchdowns and no picks. He added 48 yards on the ground via 11 carries.\n\n“He’s 6’5″, 250 pounds, runs fast, hard to tackle, hard to get down on the ground. He has an accurate, strong arm. I’m giving you a dissertation on a league MVP,” Vrabel said. “Just watch all the games and know that it’s the same as it was last week. Had a guy free. Weren’t able to make the play. Last week’s team had a guy free, we weren’t able to make a play. That’s why they drafted him and that’s why they pay him 60 million dollars.\n\n“I don’t know what to tell you. Just exactly what we knew what it was going to be, that we were going to need to get a stop or be able to tackle and if we pressured and we came free — so hopefully we get another opportunity to do that. But that won’t be for, I don’t know, but whenever we do… We’ll have to be ready for the quarterback that we have this week.”\n\nThe Patriots will be on the road to face quarterback Lamar Jackson and the Ravens before facing the Jets on the road and the Dolphins at home to cap the 2025 regular season.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos were victorious over one of the best teams in the NFC on Sunday. They clinched a playoff berth and saw the Kansas City Chiefs officially eliminated from playoff contention. It was a good day to be a Broncos fan. But good news often comes with some bad news.\n\nDuring the 34-26 win over the Packers, the Broncos saw starting safety Brandon Jones and running back RJ Harvey leave the game with injuries. These would be considered significant losses if these players miss any time, and it seems as though that could happen.\n\nStarting with Jones, who has been nothing short of terrific for the Broncos, he left the game with a chest injury, which is also being reported as a pectoral injury. P.J. Locke stepped in for him, but Locke is a considerable downgrade from Jones.\n\nThe combination of Jones and Talanoa Hufanga at safety has been one of the main reasons the Broncos' defense has been what it is this season. Locke has plenty of playing experience, but he lacks the physicality and overall athleticism that Jones brings to the lineup.\n\nAs for Harvey, he left the game late, after scoring his 10th touchdown of the season, with what was called a rib injury by sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson. That is concerning mainly because the Broncos are already thin at running back following the loss of J.K. Dobbins a few weeks ago.\n\nNot having Harvey available would force the Broncos into a tight spot. The only other running backs on the 53-man roster are Tyler Badie and Jaleel McLaughlin. Neither of them is an every-down back. The team recently signed Sincere McCormick to the practice squad, so he could get a look as well.\n\nREAD:Broncos' Christmas night showdown vs. Chiefs has become easier, less interesting\n\nBoth of these players missing any length of time would be a tough blow for the Broncos to deal with at this stage of the season.

    "fullText": "Another deep run in the NCAA Tournament is over for the No. 1 seed Texas Longhorns (26-4) after falling to the No. 3 seed Wisconsin Badgers (28-4) in the Elite Eight on Sunday at Gregory Gymnasium in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nTexas was consistently out of system for the entire match and struggled to consistently match Wisconsin in any area of the game even though the Horns held a statistical edge in several categories. The biggest issue was the subpar performance from junior outside hitter Torrey Stafford, who hit .132 with nine kills and four attacking errors — the Longhorns needed more from their star, outshone on her home court by Badgers standout Mimi Colyer notching a match-high 23 kills on a .309 hitting percentage.\n\nThe young Texas team struggled to find answers across the board as head coach Jerritt Elliott tried to find sparks from his bench, a failed effort.\n\nIn the first set, both teams came out swinging and stayed neck to neck attacking the net at 5-5. True freshman outside hitter Abby Vander Wal aided the Longhorns with four kills during the set, alongside fellow true freshman outside hitter Cari Spears landing three kills in the first set. Texas was able to gain a small lead as Wisconsin continued to capitalize on attacks and force errors to gain a 23-17 lead. Longhorn middle blocker Nya Bunton snagged a two kills for Texas as the match closed out with Wisconsin taking the opening set, 25-22, despite the Longhorns saving five set points.\n\nIn the second set, Wisconsin jumped out to an early 4-2 lead with Colyer snagging early kills. The Longhorns cut the lead to 11-10 by forcing attacking errors, but the Badgers stayed steady, maintaining their lead with outside hitter Grace Egan swinging strong at the net to extending the lead to 18-13. The Longhorns stayed in the match with the leadership of senior outside hitter Whitney Lauenstein tagging four late kills, but the Badges closed the second set, 25-21, having never trailed in it.\n\nAll gas in the intense third set with both teams pumping attack after attack with the Longhorns taking a 8-7 lead. While both teams stayed on each others heel’s by countering each other’s attacks until Longhorn setter Rella Binney served back-to-back aces to put Texas up 15-12. The Longhorns stood strong at the net, forcing Badger errors to close the third set, 25-20, to prolong the match, albeit only briefly.\n\nIn the fourth set, the Longhorns use the momentum from the third set and go on a 4-0 run with kills from Vander Wal and Spears. The Badgers did not lay down as they were able to for errors and counter attack with the aid of outside hitter Una Vajagic to go on a 12-4 run, putting Wisconsin up, 12-8. The Longhorns managed a 4-0 run while libero Ramsey Gary landed an ace bring the match to 18-15, but the Badgers eventually closed the fourth and final set by forcing seven Longhorn errors to end the match, 25-19.",

    "fullText": "Bayern hosted Hamburger SV for the first time in 13 years in the Frauen-Bundesliga. HSV was promoted to the top division this season, but has struggled in this campaign — with only one win twelve matches so far.\n\nIt took Bayern more than a quarter hour to get on the scoresheet, but Germany captain Giulia Gwinn opened the scoring with a beautiful goal. In the 28th minute, Bayern captain Georgia Stanway earned a penalty and stepped up to take it herself. She buried it to make it 2-0. Shortly before halftime, Klara Bühl ran onto a rebounded ball in the box and slotted it low and strong into the back of the net. Bayern was cruising at halftime, up 3-0.\n\nThey did not wait too long to get back to scoring after the break. In the 48th minute, Gwinn played a ball into the box, looking for Pernille Harder, but a HSV defender headed it into the back of the net. The own goal put the hosts up 4-0. Harder would have to wait until the 64th minute, but she finally got her goal to make it 5-0. The final goal came in the 86th minute, when Lea Schüller fired home beautiful header after a Bayern freekick to make it 6-0.\n\nBayern had five different goal scorers — plus the own goal in their dominant performance. They remain at the top of the table with 37 points — six points ahead of second place Wolfsburg. They will host Norwegian side Valerenga in the Champions League play before finishing the calendar year with a trip to Leverkusen for a league match. In March Hamburg will host Bayern in the next round of the DFB-Pokal Frauen.",

    "description": "The former BYU quarterback was a late transfer from BYU to Tulane, but things worked out — for BYU and for Retzlaff.",
    "fullText": "Long before BYU knew it was out of the College Football Playoff, Jake Retzlaff was already in. As a result of Tulane’s 34-21 victory over North Texas on Dec. 5 in the American Conference championship game, the Green Wave, led by the former Cougar quarterback, clinched a spot in college football’s ultimate contest.\n\nRetzlaff and No. 11 Tulane play at No. 6 Ole Miss on Saturday (1:30 p.m., TNT) in a rematch of their Sept. 20 game that didn’t go so well for the Green Wave. The Rebels limited Retzlaff to 56 yards passing and 51 yards rushing in a 45-10 victory.\n\n“I’m excited. It’s going to be a great opportunity, especially considering we didn’t even get off the plane when we played those guys the first time,” Retzlaff said. “This is a chance to make a statement on a national spotlight.”\n\nLast summer, Retzlaff was in the national spotlight for a different reason. A woman filed a civil lawsuit accusing the quarterback of sexual assault. The case was dismissed but a looming multiple-game suspension related to BYU’s honor code led Retzlaff to look elsewhere for his senior season.\n\nDisappointed, but determined, Retzlaff quietly slipped out of town.\n\n“I’ve had some really good guidance over my career — people telling me to go out the right way and stay connected to so many people that are important to me,” he said. “There are a lot of special people at BYU who are family to me, especially in that locker room.\n\n“I could probably say a lot about how or why I left, but Cougar Nation has been so great to me. I don’t feel the need to tear anyone else down. There are too many guys I care about there to say anything bad about that program.”\n\nAs Retzlaff drove away from the BYU campus last summer, his mind was full of questions. The place he had grown to love was in his rear-view mirror with an open road of uncertainty in front of him.\n\n“I knew that wherever I went, if there was an opportunity to play, that I’d have a chance to succeed,” he said. “When I found out it was Tulane, I knew we had a great chance to be that G5 team to break into the playoff.”\n\nWith no guarantee of playing time, Retzlaff had to win the starting job during fall camp and win over the team while he was doing it. As for getting the playbook down, for that he relied on his BYU experience.\n\n“I learned a lot about football from A-Rod (Aaron Roderick), Matt Mitchell, Fesi (Sitake), Harvey (Unga), TJ Woods. I learned a lot from those guys,” Retzlaff said of his former staff at BYU. “So, a lot of it was just translating the verbiage. I had already done a lot of these things before.”\n\nAfter being named Tulane’s starter, Retzlaff led the Green Wave to victories against Northwestern (23-3), South Alabama (33-31) and eventual ACC champion Duke (34-27) before running into Ole Miss. He followed the loss with another trio of wins against Tulsa (31-14), East Carolina (26-19) and Army (24-17).\n\n“This team came together like glue throughout the season,” Retzlaff said. “Truthfully, I didn’t know how it would go with me being so new and trying to get to know the guys. We have grown a lot.”\n\nFlying high at 6-1 and just outside the top 25, Tulane took a road trip to face UTSA on Oct. 30 in San Antonio. Retzlaff knew he missed BYU, but he didn’t realize how much until Tulane’s team bus pulled up to the Alamodome.\n\nDue to his untimely departure, Retzlaff never had a “last game” experience at LaVell Edwards Stadium. There was no senior walk or final hurrah in front of the home fans. But he did have the Alamo Bowl.\n\n“The emotions that came to me when I walked into that building were the exact same feelings I had when I walked in with BYU,” he said. “I went over to the locker where I had sat at — it was surreal.”\n\nIn what had to seem like only days before, Retzlaff’s mind raced back to Dec. 28 when his underdog Cougars lit up No. 23 Colorado 36-14. Not only did the victory push BYU (11-2) up to No. 13 in the final AP Top 25, but an Alamo Bowl record 7,996,679 television viewers watched them do it.\n\nThe win catapulted the Cougars into an optimistic offseason and spring practice, fused by the kind of momentum that fuels a contender for the following year. But it wasn’t to be. At least not in the way Retzlaff had thought — and certainly not in a green and white uniform.\n\n“It was an emotional experience going back to the Alamo Bowl. It just goes to show how I feel about my time at BYU,” he said. “I’m so grateful for my experience and it’s something nobody can take away from me.”\n\nUTSA hammered Tulane 48-26. Retzlaff and the Green Wave responded by winning the next five games to crack into the top 25 and reach the program’s first College Football Playoff. Throughout all of it, he has kept a close eye on his former team.\n\n“They have been so fun to watch. Every time they were on, I was glued to the television,” he said. “Boy, has that little kid, LJ Martin, grown up and become something.”\n\nMartin rushed for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns during BYU’s 11-2 regular season and was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year.\n\n“One of our first interactions on the field was during a player-run-practice before our first seasons,” Retzlaff said. “I was getting mad at him because he screwed up a play. It is literally his first day on the field, but that never changed our relationship.”\n\nWith Retzlaff’s departure, BYU turned the offense over to true freshman Bear Bachmeier who earned the Big 12’s Freshman Offensive Player of the Year.\n\n“Me and Bear have a good relationship,” Retzlaff said. “I texted him once or twice during the season.”\n\nJust as Retzlaff transformed Tulane, Bachmeier led the Cougars to the program’s first Big 12 championship game and a date in the Pop-Tarts Bowl against No. 22 Georgia Tech on Dec. 27 (1:30 p.m., ABC).\n\nRetzlaff’s 2025 stats at Tulane are comparable to what he did last season at BYU. He threw for 2,947 yards and 20 touchdowns for the Cougars, and he is up to 2,862 yards passing and 14 touchdowns for the Green Wave. Retzlaff reduced his interceptions from 12 to 6 and increased his touchdown runs from 6 to 16.\n\n“The biggest and hardest thing was getting that chemistry with the guys,” he said. “I’ve run the ball super effectively this year and learning to command a new offense has been fun.”\n\nMost of all, Retzlaff continues to win. Over the last two seasons at BYU and Tulane, he is 22-4 as a starter with a win in a bowl game and an upcoming date in the playoffs.\n\n“Doing it as a team. That might be a boring answer, but that’s the truthful answer,” said Retzlaff about his successes. “I’ve also been lucky. I’ve had some great defensive teams to play with, some great coordinators and coaches. The way it works is the team has to come together as one with no one out there being selfish.”\n\nThese are good days for Retzlaff. After winning the American Championship, ABC cameras followed him parading around Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in New Orleans as if he had been riding the Green Wave his entire life.\n\nAlong the way, Retzlaff stopped and pulled a young lady from the stands — his longtime girlfriend Jaelynn Lambert, a senior on the BYU softball team. She has been there for him through his wild ride and this spring, Retzlaff vows to be back at Gail Miller Field — for her.\n\nAlso noticeable on championship night was his mustache.\n\n“I decided to give it a shot, why not? It’s been working for me,” he joked. “I added it in the middle of the season. It was a process to get it to where it is now.”\n\nThe same can be said for Retzlaff himself. It has been a process to get to where he is now. He’s been up, down and in between — and always imperfect. Humbled by his mistakes and motivated by redemption, Retzlaff remains a BYU story even as he marches Tulane into the College Football Playoff.\n\nDave McCann is a sportswriter and columnist for the Deseret News and is a play-by-play announcer and show host for BYUtv/ESPN+.

    "title": "Quinn Hughes ‘Extremely Open-Minded’ About Future With Wild After First Night In Minnesota",
    "description": "Hughes arrives in Minnesota, impressing immediately with his calm demeanor and on-ice performance, fueling excitement for his future with the Wild.",
    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn - Quinn Hughes has been in Minnesota for about a day. He came in on a flight last night with Wild General Manager and President of Hockey Operations Bill Guerin and Assistant General Manager Chris Kelleher.\n\n\"Yeah, he’s a funny guy,\" Hughes said about Guerin and his flight. \"Obviously, a tremendous career, and I really appreciate him trading the assets that he did to get me. Some teams, they’re in until they hear what they have to trade to get me, but Billy was just full in. I think that was his first offer. So, obviously I want to do what I can here and prove him right. How he handled me with the 4 Nations last year, too, gave me a glimpse of what a good person he is. And, honestly, he was a big reason why I wanted to come here.\"\n\nHis comfort level stood out immediately. The way he carried himself after the game was incredible. He was calm, confident, and thoughtful. It made it feel less like he had just arrived and more like he had been part of the organization for years.\n\nThat ease carried over onto the ice.\n\nHe played his first game with the Wild on Sunday night amid a raucous home crowd that made its presence felt long before the puck dropped.\n\nWarmups brought a noticeable buzz. Each touch of the puck drew a reaction from the 18,322 in attendance. The response from the stands was immediate, and so was Hughes’ awareness of it.\n\n\"It was pretty special honestly,\" he said. \"I wasn’t expecting that. But that was very cool. I know it’s a hockey market but that was exciting.\"\n\nThe Roar Said Everything: Wild Fans Welcome Quinn Hughes From roaring ovations to custom jerseys, Minnesota Wild fans declared their support for new defenseman Quinn Hughes.\n\nFor a player of Hughes’ stature — a Norris Trophy winner, a franchise defenseman, and one of the NHL’s premier puck-movers in the league, first impressions matter. Minnesota, in a span of hours, made one.\n\nMinnesota toppled the Boston Bruins on Sunday for Hughes' debut by beating them 6-2. Hughes scored a goal and was the first star of the night even though both Kirill Kaprizov and Ryan Hartman had three points.\n\nHeck, Kaprizov tied Mikko Koivu for second all-time in goals and the media still selected Hughes as the first star.\n\n“The first thing is just the players and the guys in the room. Just getting a glimpse, obviously I met everyone four hours ago. Just how great the room has been and welcoming and obviously on the ice today just some of the elite talent they have,\" Hughes said on what excites him most about the Wild.\n\n\"Kirill gave me a pass in the second. I just wasn’t ready for it, and I would have had an open net. But as time goes on here, I start to read off him he starts to read off me. I think it’s going to take four, five, six games. But once we get rolling, I think we’re going to be hard to beat.”\n\nthe smile speaks for itself 😃 pic.twitter.com/GincKFeZ6E\n\n— Minnesota Wild (@mnwild) December 15, 2025\n\nHughes, 26, was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in 2018. He had been with them since but knew his time there could be coming to an end recently. His agent Pat Brisson and Canucks President of Hockey Operations Jim Rutherford worked on a list of places that Hughes would fit well in.\n\n\"Yeah, honestly, I don’t know how much I’m allowed to say, but the ultimate respect for Jim Rutherford and Francesco Aquilini and the Aquilini Family. They were first class with everything that was going on. Obviously, it was a tough situation, but it felt like it was time. And I think Jim did too. But Jim and Pat, very lucky to have him. They were kind of talking a lot about places I might feel comfortable. And Jim was amazing with that. He cared about the person. He wanted me to go where he thought I’d be happy.\"\n\nIn the third period, Brock Faber made a play in the neutral zone to send the puck up the gut. Nicolas Aube-Kubel once touched passed it to Ryan Hartman who skated in and dropped it off for Hughes who scored his first goal with the Wild.\n\nWELCOME TO QUINNESOTA pic.twitter.com/fqO9796iVC\n\n— Minnesota Wild (@mnwild) December 15, 2025\n\nIt was the loudest I have ever heard the arena when he scored and when they announced his goal call. The State of Hockey is so pumped to have a superstar like Hughes and Sunday night showed why.\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely, warm-ups I think was the loudest I’ve ever heard it since I’ve played here,\" Faber said. \"Obviously, everyone’s excited. The State of Minnesota is excited to get a player and person of that caliber, it doesn’t happen often that a guy like that gets moved, so it was really cool and it’s going to be a lot of fun to watch for our fans.\"\n\nBut this really doesn't all happen without the Wild's management and Hughes spoke so glowingly of them, but especially Guerin.\n\nThe hockey fit was important, obviously, but the people fit may have mattered just as much to Hughes and to the Wild.\n\nHughes spent time with Wild general manager Bill Guerin during the flight to Minnesota, and that interaction left an impression that extended far beyond small talk.\n\nMeatballs, Latex Gloves, And A Franchise Defenseman: Inside The Wild's Blockbuster Trade For Quinn Hughes A kitchen, meatballs, and latex gloves. That's where the Wild's blockbuster move for franchise defenseman Quinn Hughes ended. The window is now open.\n\nThe superstar defenseman was well aware that other teams were interested in him and sent offers. He was also aware that interest often stops once the real price becomes clear. Guerin didn’t hesitate. He committed and made the deal.\n\nThat matters to players and especially to the elite ones.\n\nHughes didn’t frame the trade purely in transactional terms. He framed it as belief and revealed how much weight he places on how organizations operate behind the scenes.\n\nFor Hughes, this wasn’t just about joining a good roster. It was about joining leadership he respected.\n\n“I just got here, but a big reason why is obviously because I thought they’re a tremendous group, just playing them over the years. Hard to play against, really hard to play against, but got elite skill as well. Obviously, knowing that I was going to be able to play with Faber, Spurgeon, too, two elite players and Brodin and some other guys that are great back there, Bogo. But yeah to play with those guys I knew would be pretty good for me, too.”\n\nIt goes beyond the players though. Everyone knows how close this group of guys are. The core here is tight and all elite. When talking about Matt Boldy, Faber, Kaprizov and so on. Now adding Hughes to the core is dangerous.\n\nAnd he respects the crap out of Guerin for trading the players he did to acquire the star.\n\nSo much so that even the rumors of him wanting to play with his brother in New Jersey or him wanting to be back home in Michigan and signing with Detroit, didn't even sound like they were serious when Hughes talked.\n\nSo how open-minded is he about signing long-term in Minnesota?\n\n“Extremely open-minded. They got an amazing core,\" he said. \"I’ve only been here four hours but getting to know some of the guys and how energetic and positive guys are and then Minnesota being so close to Michigan and just the State of Hockey and the passion here. Just seeing how the fans reacted to me as well in warmups.\"\n\nNothing about Hughes’ first night in Minnesota felt temporary. From the roar during warmups to the trust shown by the front office, the Wild didn’t just acquire a superstar, they made a statement. Hughes hasn’t been here long enough to make promises, but he’s been here long enough to notice who believed in him, who valued him, and what it feels like to be wanted. For Minnesota, that impression may end up mattering just as much as the trade itself, the money itself or any other factor you want to put into it.\n\n\"I got a lot of time for Billy for quote unquote sacking up and making the deal like he did and just how he valued me. There are other teams that probably could have thrown in certain packages like that, too, but at the end of the day they didn’t want to do that or they didn’t want to trade two or three assets from their team. Billy did, so I’ll remember that and that means a lot to me that Billy did that.”\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "description": "Offseason Notes 5",
    "fullText": "With the MLB Winter Meetings heading up all the headlines for the previous week-plus, there has been very little other San Diego Padres news. The rumors, on the other hand, have been running rampant.\n\nIt started with many prominent baseball writers opining that there is no way for the Padres to survive their change of ownership and budget cuts without trading Fernando Tatis Jr. President of baseball operations A.J. Preller did his best to dispel those rumors during his media appearance at the meetings by stating that Tatis was staying put.\n\nThe other prevailing rumor was that the Padres would be converting either Mason Miller or Adrian Morejon from the bullpen to the starting rotation. This was at least a credible rumor as Preller had acknowledged it was being considered in previous statements. He stated on Day 1 of the meetings that idea was largely dismissed.\n\nThe next rumor floated was that members of the bullpen, Miller and Morejon included, are on the trading block in order to bring back starting pitching.\n\nPreller stated that was not part of the plan, as the bullpen is a strength and he was not interested in diluting that advantage.\n\nThe next subject of the rumor mill was Jake Cronenworth, who is considered to be sought after by teams who need a defensively-talented and versatile infielder who is a valuable offensive player.\n\nThe Cronenworth rumor seems to occur every offseason since he was signed to an extension that gives him $12 million annually through 2030. Up ‘til now, Cronenworth continues to be a Padre and is considered a leader on the team.\n\nThe latest rumors involve Miller, Morejon, Jeremiah Estrada, Nick Pivetta and Ramón Laureano all coveted by the New York Mets, and the Padres are actively in discussions to acquire both pitchers and position players from the Mets’ young prospects and major leaguers (mlbtraderumors).\n\nThe Padres seem to have a complete coaching staff now, though the announcements have not been made officially. Many of the new coaches have connections to new manager Craig Stammen.\n\nAfter retaining bench coach Brian Esposito, pitching coach Ruben Niebla, bullpen coach Ben Fritz, first base coach Dave Macias and the two assistant hitting coaches, the Padres named a second bench coach in Randy Knorr. Mike McCoy and Pat O’Sullivan remain as assistant hitting coaches with new hitting coach Steven Souza.\n\nSouza was a special assistant with the Tampa Bay Rays, was a power hitter as a player and seems to reflect the organization shifting its offensive focus to more aggression. Niebla was given a new title as assistant manager as well as pitching coach.\n\nRyan Goins, hired as an infield coach, was an infield specialist and was on Ron Washington’s staff with the Los Angeles Angels before Washington left due to illness. He was named bench coach after the previous bench coach was named interim manager. Goins was considered a glove-first player as a major leaguer.\n\nKevin Plawecki has been with the Padres as a catching coach in the minor leagues and will move into that role with the major league team. He was a catcher in both the minor leagues with the Padres and a back up catcher with the Mets and Boston Red Sox. He retired after the 2024 season and assumed a coaching role with the Padres.\n\nBob Henley, who spent almost his entire baseball career with the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals, has been hired as the new third base coach. He first had the role in 2014-2021 with the Nationals and then went into a player development role. Stammen pitched with the Nationals from 2009-2015 so there is significant familiarity between them.\n\nRHP Misael Tamarez, who was a free agent after the 2025 season, re-signed with the organization on Dec. 4. RHP Evan Fitterer also signed a minor league contract as a free agent on Dec. 8.\n\nFormer Padres closer Suarez joined former starter Dylan Cease in signing a free agent contract and earning a big payday. Suarez is committed to the Atlanta Braves for three years and $45 million in a setup/ backup closer role.\n\nPadres to the World Baseball Classic\n\nFernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado will be managed by Albert Pujols with the Dominican Republic team. Shortstop Xander Bogaerts will play for the Netherlands team as a native of Aruba. There is a report that Nick Pivetta is considering committing to the Canadian team.\n\nLuis Campusano finishes in winter ball\n\nA.J. Preller stated at the winter meetings that Campusano has finished his time with Tigers de Licey in the Dominican Winter League. He finished with 19 games played and 50 at-bats. His batting line was .200/.293/.340 with a .633 OPS. He had two homers and eight RBI.\n\nPreller has had multiple questions asked regarding Campusano’s future with the team. He will be given another opportunity this spring to show that he belongs on the major league roster. If he is not successful there are no more options for him to be sent to the minors. The options will be to trade him or try to pass him through waivers in order to be optioned.",

    "fullText": "Frankie de la Noche was different from Gus Marlowe and Professor Saber in that he only technically appeared once this season—though his creation was preceded by a detective article that served as a proof of concept. That first noir piece was also the first time I stepped outside my usual voice and wrote in an entirely different style.\n\nUp to that point, my writing had followed a pretty clear progression. My first fan post was a classic Crescibene smackdown of ESPN’s Watchability Index—pure fire, pure indignation, very much in the same voice as my anti-corruption writing on Medium. The next two articles were more traditional baseball analysis, focused on the player pipeline and the GM pipeline within the Cleveland organization. Those pieces were still written in my voice, but structurally they were recognizable as standard sports analysis.\n\nThe detective article broke from all of that. It wasn’t just a tonal shift; it was a structural one. And as far as I’ve been able to tell, no one else is doing sports journalism quite like this.\n\nEarly in the season, after my first few fan posts, I wrote a one-off detective noir piece that explored the Guardians roster as a mystery. At that point, there was no Frankie de la Noche. What I was really doing was experimenting with style—seeing if I could write a roster analysis in a completely different way. Instead of presenting information directly, I treated the roster like a case file. It was a risk, but it worked.\n\nThe response to that article made it clear that style itself could carry meaning, and that a strong narrative voice could make familiar information feel fresh again. At the time, I didn’t know I was laying the groundwork for a recurring character. I just knew it was a style I wanted to return to later.\n\nOnce Gus Marlowe had established himself as a recurring presence, I realized I needed other recurring characters to join him. That’s when the idea of a detective character took shape—a way to return to the noir style, but this time with a defined voice behind it rather than just an experiment in form.\n\nThat’s when Frankie de la Noche was born.\n\nFrankie is the dramatized version of my internal dialogue when I’m trying to make sense of roster construction, call-ups, logjams, and front-office decisions that don’t quite add up. In Frankie’s first true appearance, I introduced him in his office at Progressive Field—a single light glowing beneath a door on the fourth floor, late at night, rain tapping against the windows. It was a classic noir setting, and a deliberate callback to the original detective article. Noir characters are inseparable from their environments, and I wanted readers to feel like they were stepping into Frankie’s space in an immersive way.\n\nThat said, Frankie is still very much a character in formation. The setting is established. The tone is established. The function is established. But his mannerisms, rhythms, and specific quirks are still emerging. Characters like this aren’t built all at once; they reveal themselves through repetition.\n\nThat was something Gus taught me over the course of the season. His abrupt entrances, clipped phrasing, and chaotic exits weren’t planned in advance—they were discovered over time. They came from seeing him in different situations and letting consistency form naturally. Frankie is now going through that same process of discovery.\n\nFrankie de la Noche will certainly be back as there will be no shortage of roster mysteries next season. I already know there are other settings where Frankie belongs—and yes, there will absolutely be a late-night encounter under a bridge in the Flats. Maybe Frankie has an informant. Maybe someone slips him an inside scoop.\n\nThe goal going forward is the same one I had with Gus: to make Frankie feel immediately recognizable. I want readers to know his voice the moment he starts talking. When Frankie shows up, it should feel like running into someone you’ve met before.\n\nIn review, Frankie de la Noche this season was more of an exploration than a finished product. He emerged out of a stylistic experiment, found a purpose once the cast of characters began to take shape, and made his first real appearance with more potential than polish. And that’s fine. That’s how characters should start. Where it goes from here… only Frankie knows.\n\nSo what do you think? Did the noir pieces work for you? Did Frankie feel like someone worth revisiting? And when the next mystery comes along, would you like to see him take another case?\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.",

    "description": "The NY Giants hold the No.1 pick after their eighth consecutive loss.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants suffered a frustrating 29-21 loss to the Washington Commanders on Sunday as they returned from their bye week. As a result, the Giants continued to hold the No.1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThere were some flashes, like Abdul Carter having a breakout game, big plays from tight ends Daniel Bellinger and Theo Johnson, DB Dru Phillips, and RB Tyrone Tracy. But there were simply too many miscues and missed opportunities to overcome with late magic. But ultimately it was too little, too late for the Giants and their frantic comeback fell short.\n\nThe loss also highlighted the shortcomings of the Giants’ roster, as the receivers consistently failed to get open, once again forcing Jaxson Dart to hold the ball or take a big hit when scrambling, and struggled to hang onto the ball when they did find separation. This was also (probably) Jermaine Eluemunor’s worst game of the season, as he struggled against veteran pass rusher Von Miller, and the Giants struggled to consistently move the ball in short-yardage situations on the ground.\n\nThe Giants’ eighth-consecutive loss comes one day after Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThat brings us to the upside of the loss for the Giants: there are a number of quarterback-needy teams in the Top 10 of the draft, and it’s possible that Mendoza will be the only highly-regarded quarterback to come out this year. That could make the first overall pick highly valuable if teams like the New York Jets, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, and New Orleans Saints are all vying for the top quarterback prospect.\n\nNobody wants to see the Giants lose, but trading the first overall pick could net valuable assets to fill multiple holes in the first two or three rounds. The Giants could use a highly-drafted receiver as well as a long-term answer at right tackle. Likewise, the Giants need a long-term answer at right guard and an infusion of youth and athleticism at linebacker.\n\nMost early mock drafts have the Giants drafting a wide receiver or an offensive tackle with their first pick. A sizeable haul of picks could allow them to address both positions with high picks, as well as add one of the talented linebackers or defensive backs in this class.\n\nIt remains to be seen who will make that pick, but the Giants could have a tremendous amount of capital to go with a young roster.\n\nThe Giants’ road to the first overall pick is a tight one. They share a 2-12 record with the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders (who they play in two weeks). The Jets, Browns, and Arizona Cardinals are also each a game out of the first pick at 3-11, though the Saints managed to beat the Carolina Panthers and improve to 4-10 on the season.\n\nNew York still has games against the Minnesota Vikings, the afore-mentioned Raiders, and the Dallas Cowboys to end the season. They remain a team that can compete with any in the NFL, as well as lose to any in the NFL, so no outcome between 1st and 10th overall is out of the question.",

The Lions (8-6) haven’t made the postseason in three consecutive campaigns since 1993-95, and understood coming into the weekend that even winning out might not be enough to get a playoff berth and end that streak.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — The Detroit Lions know what it takes to compete with the best in the loaded NFC after a 41-34 loss to the conference-leading Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.\n\nBut with three games and zero margin for error remaining to make the playoffs, the Lions are running out of time to be able to put those lessons to use.\n\n“You know what it is. And we’re not there right now,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said. “Doesn’t know we can’t be, but now we know what it looks like, and you got to get better. We got to get better. We got to move on. Can’t sulk about it. Can’t felly sorry for ourselves. We make the corrections, and we move on.”\n\nThe Lions (8-6) haven’t made the postseason in three consecutive campaigns since 1993-95, and understood coming into the weekend that even winning out might not be enough to get a playoff berth and end that streak.\n\nThey came out with a first half worthy of the Super Bowl aspirations they entered the season with, taking a 24-14 lead with 30 seconds remaining behind a dynamic passing attack from quarterback Jared Goff to wide receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, plus a jaw-dropping interception by edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson on a tight end screen and returning it 58 yards.\n\n“Aidan made a great play,” Los Angeles quarterback Matthew Stafford said. “Looked like he was the primary receiver on the damn play. Made me look silly in space.”\n\nBut the Rams (11-3) snatched a field goal to end the second quarter, and the Lions could not regain momentum after the break, going three-and-out on both possessions in the third quarter while the defense gave up 17 points.\n\nGoff pointed to ineffectiveness on first down in the second half, forcing the offensive line into situations where Los Angeles could turn to its powerful pass rush. Campbell essentially agreed, noting an overall inability to run the ball as Detroit had two carries for 11 yards in the third quarter, plus a holding penalty which negated a first down and left the offense facing third-and-long.\n\n“But, the bottom line is, we weren’t able to convert, and so then we strung the defense out, and then all of a sudden it flips,” Campbell said. “You’re up 10, you’re down 10, and that was a rough quarter for us.”\n\nThe Lions finished with just 70 yards rushing on 20 carries, having failed to win any of their five games this season when totaling less than 100 yards on the ground.\n\nGoff went 25 of 41 for 338 yards and three touchdowns, finding St. Brown 13 times for 164 yards and two scores and Williams seven times for 134 yards and a score, though their overall effectiveness dropped off in the second half.\n\nDetroit needs to win its final three games — against Pittsburgh, at Minnesota on a short week, and at Chicago — and get help to have a shot at the playoffs\n\nGoff expressed belief the Lions can still put a streak together, even after alternating wins and losses for the past 10 games.\n\n“We’re resilient,” Goff said. “I hope I can give you a really good answer in a couple weeks. But we’re resilient. We really are, and I expect us to bounce back from this, and we still have plenty of stuff in front of us.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "We discuss the most important golf figures of the last 12 months, the drama of PGA Tour Q-School, an insane golf record and more.",
    "fullText": "Check in every week for the unfiltered opinions of our writers and editors as they break down the hottest topics in the sport, and join the conversation by tweeting us at @golf_com. This week, we discuss the most important golf figures of the last 12 months, the drama of PGA Tour Q-School and more.\n\nAs we count down the final days of 2025, let’s take a quick moment to reflect on the year that was. Who were the most important golf figures of 2025?\n\nJack Hirsh, associate equipment editor (@JR_HIRSHey): Important? I think it's got to be new PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp and new LPGA commissioner Craig Kessler. Both have taken over legacy properties badly in need of fresh ideas and new perspective. Already we're hearing talks of massive changes for the PGA Tour schedule as soon as 2027. Whether you like them or not, the Tour is clearly looking for something that will put its LIV Golf problem to bed. With Kessler and the LPGA, a new TV deal seems like it could be the spark to get the Tour to ride this new wave of interest in women's sports around the world. There are certainly more important names in the golf world right now, but none will have more pressure to achieve their goals in 2026 than these two.\n\nZephyr Melton, associate game-improvement editor (@zephyrmelton): Jack laid it out well, but I'll go ahead and give Tiger Woods his obligatory mention. The popularity of the sport still ebbs and flows with Tiger - as evidenced by the heaps of coverage when he so much as posts a swing video. His competitive career may be behind him, but his influence on the game remains unmatched.\n\nJosh Sens, senior writer (@JoshSens): Good answers above. To them, I'd add Rory McIlroy for providing the most compelling entertainment of the year at both the Masters and the Ryder Cup. And Tommy Fleetwood for best feel-good story. But that's more about rooting interest than importance. Beyond those guys, some non-traditional golf figures come to mind, especially at a time when the game is stretching increasingly beyond its old boundaries. Caitlin Clark getting into golf. LeBron James going viral with every swing posted online. And though I'd rather get a root canal than watch a bunch of \"influencers\" knock it around, clearly people are interested, as we saw with the success of the Internet Invitational. Welcome to the future, for better or worse.\n\nAnd who - not mentioned above - might we be talking about in this space a year from now as a key figure of 2026?\n\nHirsh: I think it will be someone like Jon Rahm. His prominence in the game has seemed to diminish since his move to LIV, but he’s still played pretty well and I think will start making more of an impact in majors. He still hasn’t won one since the 2023 Masters.\n\nMelton: How bout Brooks Koepka? Speaking of LIV, he's long been rumored to want out of his LIV deal in order to get back to the PGA Tour. Could 2026 be the year we see a LIV star defect back to the Tour? If it is, BK is likely the first domino to fall.\n\nSens: Bryson. His impact shows no sign of slowing.\n\nFive players earned Tour cards for 2026 via PGA Tour Q-School Sunday at TPC Sawgrass. Which outcome - the good or bad - stuck out to you the most?\n\nHirsh: Sad to see one of the Tour's great people, Camilo Villegas, come up one shot short of a playoff to keep full playing status on the Tour. He'll still be around as a former winner, but I wouldn't be surprised if former winners hanging onto fringe status is exactly what shrinking the number of exempt players from 125 to 100 is targeting.\n\nMelton: Alejandro Tosti is headed back to the Tour - and the content gods thank him.\n\nSens: Villegas' final missed shorty on 18 was painful. But it was touching to see him stick around to celebrate with his friend and countryman Marcelo Rozo. Personally, I was rooting for Spencer Levin, who has been around the block and then some and just didn't have his best stuff today.\n\nSpeaking of the Tour’s aforementioned card changes, are five cards from Q-School enough? Too little? And is Q-School still a key part of the Tour’s construction?\n\nHirsh: We absolutely need Q-School, especially now that Monday Qs are gone. I think five is a good number, especially with the Korn Ferry Tour shrinking to 20 cards. I also like the hard five instead of the ties, because a playoff, like we got this year, for the last PGA Tour card of the season is pretty awesome. But I'd also like to use this space to mention we still need Monday Qs.\n\nMelton: I'd like to see Q-School give even more cards. We always talk about \"life-changing\" weeks in pro golf, but there's no tournament where that's more true than the Final Stage of Q-School. The drama of it is unlike anything else in the sport, and that makes it one of the coolest weeks of the year.\n\nSens: Five feels about right. And eliminating ties only adds to the excitement. Nothing like a sudden-death playoff to cap a four-day stress test.\n\nOur Josh Sens recently wrote about a golfer who just broke a world record for most courses played in a year. What’s your number? And if you could pick one course you have already played to tee it up on for the rest of your life, which is it?\n\nHirsh: First of all, that's a level of golf sicko-ness of which I'm not familiar. Bravo! I have no idea what the most courses I've ever played is. Probably around 20. I'm sure Zephyr has played some ungodly number of courses the last couple years. If I had to pick one course though, it would probably be Royal Dornoch. Links golf is undefeated.\n\nMelton: I wish I played half as much golf as my co-workers think I play. I only logged 40 rounds in 2025! As for the most courses, it's likely in the range of 30 or so. When you don't belong to a club, variety is the name of the game. As for one course for the rest of my life? Give me Pasatiempo. Elite course. Elite vibe. Elite logo.\n\nSens: I'd only be guessing at an annual number. Probably 50? That was a year in my 20s when I waited tables at night and would sneak out to the muni pre-weekday shifts. As for a single course, tough question. In the absence of a perfect answer: Cruden Bay. I don't think I've ever had more fun on a course.\n\nThe post Tour Confidential: The most important golf figures of 2025 appeared first on Golf.",

Their only dropped set came in the Round of 32 against UCLA. Outside of that brief hiccup, Kentucky has controlled matches from start to finish and remains undefeated at home this season.\n\nWisconsin arrives in Kansas City after a statement win over No. 1 Texas in the Elite Eight. The Badgers earned a measure of revenge against the Longhorns, who handed Wisconsin one of its four losses during the regular season. Kentucky accounted for Texas’ other two defeats, beating the Longhorns in both the regular season and the SEC Tournament championship.\n\nThursday’s matchup also carries historical weight for Big Blue Nation. Wisconsin was the team that ended Kentucky men’s basketball’s perfect 38–0 season in the 2015 Final Four, denying the Wildcats an undefeated national title.\n\nNow, Kentucky volleyball has an opportunity to write a different ending against the Badgers on the sport’s biggest stage.\n\nIf the Wildcats advance, they’ll face the winner of the other national semifinal matchup, which sees No. 1 seed Pittsburgh, who actually handed Kentucky one of its regular-season losses, take on No. 3 seed Texas A&M, whom the Cats defeated in College Station.\n\nWith a spot in the national championship match on the line, the Wildcats will look to continue their dominant run and settle an old score. The national championship game is Sunday, Dec. 21, on ABC at 3:30 PM ET.\n\nThe semifinal is set. \n\nvs. Wisconsin on Thursday, 9:00 p.m. ET at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City😼\n\nTickets: https://t.co/sv5Hlwlsn1#WeAreUK x #BBN pic.twitter.com/BxN8vh57w8\n\n— Kentucky Volleyball (@KentuckyVB) December 15, 2025",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch the NFL game tonight\n\nEntering the final quarter of the NFL season, it’s officially do-or-die for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSitting at a precarious 6-6-1 after a damaging Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Cowboys are clinging to life in the NFC playoff picture. The road to the NFC East crown has become a steep uphill climb, with the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles holding a significant advantage at 8-5. For Dallas, the margin for error has evaporated; it can no longer afford the inconsistent performances that have defined its season.\n\nWith the NFC wild-card race stacked — featuring contenders like the Lions, Panthers and Buccaneers — the Cowboys need a near-perfect run to separate themselves. Their remaining schedule features three of four games against NFC opponents with playoff implications. The crucible begins immediately in Week 15 with a pivotal home Sunday Night Football clash against the Minnesota Vikings (5-8).\n\nWhile Minnesota will almost certainly miss the playoffs, it provides a tough matchup for Dallas. The Vikings' defense is coming off a game where it shut out the Commanders, forcing three turnovers and giving up just over 200 yards in a 31-0 win. Offensively, while J.J. McCarthy has had his struggles in his first year as a starter, the Vikings still have plenty of weapons to boats, including a top wide receiver duo in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison; with these two, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, the receiving talent is off the charts.\n\nDallas needs a home primetime win to keep its playoff aspirations alive, while Minnesota is looking to build on the momentum it generated last week.\n\nFollow along for all the action from AT&T Stadium.\n\nSTREAM: Watch Vikings vs. Cowboys LIVE with Peacock\n\nNFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\n10:42 p.m.: Williams is back with two big carries.

    "fullText": "The Cowboys received mixed news as the second half started. Javonte Williams was back (and did well on his first carry), but Hunter Luepke was ruled out with a concussion. It was noted that the injury occurred on the final kickoff to end the first half.\n\nLuke Schoonmaker (really) had an amazing catch that put the Cowboys at the Minnesota 11-yard line. A play later it appeared that CeeDee Lamb was interfered with in the end zone, but nothing was called.\n\nUnfortunately the Cowboys had to settle for a field goal which felt like a failure. Still, points are points.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 20, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 26-yard field goal)\n\nThis will sound shocking, but it is true. The Dallas Cowboys defense pitched a three and out on their next drive. It was a Christmas miracle.\n\nDallas tried to get KaVontae Turpin involved on offense on the next possession, a curious move given that George Pickens had not really had many moments at this point in the game. But hey, whatever.\n\nThings stalled out yet again and Brandon Aubrey delivered once more.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 41-yard field goal)\n\nRight off the bat the Vikings were across midfield. Playing with your food has consequences.\n\nNot long after that the Vikings were up against the goal line. Keep in mind before you reed the next sentence that the previous Cowboys four possessions ended with a field goal kick (they missed one obviously).\n\nBoom. Vikings touchdown. The lead changed hands.\n\nC.J. Ham is in for the go-ahead touchdown\n\nMINvsDAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/Mr3FNwwnmg\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 24 (C.J.

They moved thoroughly down the field and kept getting in their own way to keep themselves from scoring a touchdown. They wound up with a short situation right on the goal line and then J.J. McCarthy pulled the Peyton Manning bootleg.\n\nEmbarrassing pic.twitter.com/AJugDLlRaS\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 14 (J.J. McCarthy touchdown)\n\nThe game was tied at this point which felt weird because it had for so long felt like Dallas was in control. The Cowboys nevertheless began moving once more and ultimately stalled out in field goal range. Brandon Aubrey, though.\n\nUnfortunately Aubrey pushed his 51-yard attempt wide to the right which kept things tied and gave the Vikings solid field position to work with.\n\nMinnesota was able to scrap out a field goal which gave them their first lead of the night. It set Dallas up with a chance to score and 1:48 to do so. Given that Dallas deferred to start the game the drive also offered a potential double-dip opportunity.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 17 (Will Reichard 29-yard field goal)\n\nThe Cowboys were able to work quickly to get in field goal range themselves. Given Aubrey’s recent miss there was a little bit of breath holding for the first time in a while with him.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 17, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 17-yard field goal)\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys won the toss and deferred which put the defense on the field first. Given that there were reports about how Logan Wilson was set to start at linebacker… it was exciting to say the least.\n\nIt took two plays for things to get legitimately exciting. Donovan Wilson got pressure in J.J. McCarthy’s face and wisely put his hand up to block a pass. That errant ball landed in the expectant arms of Quinnen Williams to give the Cowboys a turnover and more importantly… the ball!\n\nQUINNEN WILLIAMS INT! pic.twitter.com/ImWT83EQCu\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAfter a couple of plays the Cowboys appeared to stall out and had to settle for a Brandon Aubrey field goal. They didn’t, though! They ran a fake! And got it!\n\nBRANDON AUBREY WITH THE WHEELS pic.twitter.com/GGGBuE5B1i\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAmazingly the Cowboys got down to another fourth down and went for it yet again, although this time conventionally by way of a Javonte Williams run.\n\nAfter getting it Javonte was in the end zone one play later.\n\nJAVONTE TD! pic.twitter.com/3ObBLpnpmW\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 0 (Javonte Williams touchdown)\n\nThe Cowboys defense went to work and while they were not able to generate a turnover they did force a punt. Dante Fowler was a particular point of pride on the possession in question and helped stop Aaron Jones.\n\nUnfortunately KaVontae Turpin let a punt go that he maybe should have fielded. The bounce really worked against Dallas and put them just about on their own goal line.\n\nMalik Davis was in at running back for the possession as it was reported that Javonte Williams was dealing with a shoulder injury. Ultimately the Cowboys wound up punting after a three and out as they did not want to get too cute.\n\nIt took two plays once more for Minnesota to have a moment. On the first one of them Aaron Jones had a massive gain and a penalty added to it to make matters worse. A few seconds later J.J. McCarthy hit Jalen Nailor for a game-tying touchdown.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 7 (J.J. McCathy to Jalen Nailor touchdown)\n\nWhen the Cowboys took over it was noted by the NBC broadcast that Javonte Williams was questionable to return with a shoulder injury so that corroborated everything to date.\n\nDak Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for a huge gain and the Cowboys were in striking distance as the opening quarter came to a close. To help matters a facemask penalty really put Dallas close to another score.",

    "fullText": "SEATTLE (AP) — Noah Ostlund, Tage Thompson and Zach Benson all scored and the Buffalo Sabres beat the Seattle Kraken 3-1 on Sunday for their third straight win.\n\nAlex Tuch had two assists and Alex Lyon made 23 saves for the Sabres.\n\nChandler Stephenson scored for Seattle, and Joey Daccord stopped 20 shots. The Kraken have lost eight of their last nine games (1-7-1).\n\nOstlund opened the scoring on a 2-on-1 alongside Josh Norris with 2:51 to go in the first period. Ryker Evans failed to intercept two passes between the Sabres skaters.\n\nNot long after a successful penalty kill by the Sabres, Thompson doubled Buffalo’s lead with 9:52 left in the second. Payton Krebs set him up for the shot with a short pass close to the net, as the two were left unguarded by Seattle. It was Thompson’s 16th goal of the season.\n\nStephenson put the Kraken on the board with 7:36 left in the middle period. The goal came 6 seconds into Seattle’s second power play of the night.\n\nBenson added an empty-net goal with 46 seconds left.\n\nDespite the recent win streak, Sabres general manager Kevyn Adams entered this season on the hot seat and there are concerns owner Terry Pegula could shake up his front office sometime this week. Adams is in his sixth season as GM and the Sabres are once again near the bottom of the standings and already in jeopardy of extending their NHL record playoff drought to a 15th season.\n\nSabres: Host Philadelphia on Thursday night.\n\nKraken: Host Colorado on Tuesday night.\n\nAP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL",

    "description": "Following the Colts' Week 15 loss to Seattle, here are three quick takeaways from what took place with Phillip Rivers at quarterback.",
    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts came up short in Week 15 against Seattle. A field goal in the final seconds would secure the win for the Seahawks.\n\nWith the dust having settled on Sunday's game, let's take a look back at what took place with the three things we learned from the Colts' performance.\n\nThis was far from a flashy performance, but Rivers delivered what the Colts needed -- stability at quarterback. He completed 18-of-27 passes for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception.\n\nRivers helped the Colts' offense sustain drives and kept the ball out of harm's way until the very end.\n\nIndianapolis leaned into the running game to keep Rivers and the offense ahead of the sticks and out of long down-and-distance situations, and they relied on the qick passing game as well.\n\nOn both sides of the ball, the Colts fought hard in this game and this team needed some juice after Daniel Jones exited last week's game -- which Rivers provided.\n\nThe Seattle offense entered this game as one of the most productive in football, both in points and in yards, especially through the air. But the Colts were able to contain the Seahawks for much of the game.\n\nFor one, Seattle didn't score a single touchdown in this game. The Colts also did well getting off the field, holding Seattle to just two third-down conversions. The Seahawks offense also averaged a modest 5.3 yards per play.\n\nThe Colts did this while down their top two cornerbacks and without DeForest Buckner.\n\nUltimately, with the game close late, Seattle's more talented offense prevailed. But as the Colts' offense tried to find its footing in this game, the defense kept things close.\n\nAll of that sounds good -- and those are positives -- but the reality is the Colts also lost, and their playoff hopes took another hit.\n\nThe Colts are now 8-6 on the season. With Jacksonville winning on Sunday, Indianapolis is now two games back of the AFC South lead. Houston's win helped them improve to 9-5.\n\nThe Colts now trail the Texans by a game for the AFC's final wildcard spot and are two games back of the 10-4 Chargers and Bills.\n\nThe Colts do play the Texans once more, but also have to face the 10-win 49ers and the 10-win Jaguars.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts lose to Seahawks: 3 takeaways from performance",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers took on the Tennessee Titans on Sunday and earned a win, but there were a few 49ers who didn't have their best games.",
    "fullText": "After a week off, the San Francisco 49ers welcomed the Tennessee Titans to Levi's Stadium for a Week 15 battle, and Kyle Shanahan's squad earned a _ victory, moving them to 10-4 on the season.\n\nWhile San Francisco secured the win, they played far from their best game, and there are quite a few 49ers who will probably want to move on quickly.\n\nHere are some of San Francisco's worst performers from Sunday's win.\n\nBurford has jumped in as the starting left guard after Ben Bartch suffered a season-ending injury and Connor Colby was benched. On Sunday, he allowed the pressure that resulted in Brock Purdy's strip sack. He was also called for a false start on San Francisco's second-to-last possession.\n\nTennessee doesn't boast the best passing game in the league, but they have a decent ground attack. Robert Saleh's unit should've been keyed in on stopping Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears, but the duo combined for 138 yards and a score (Pollard's) on 8.1 yards per attempt. Injuries have decimated San Francisco's defensive front, but they still should be better than that.\n\nRobinson hasn't done much the last couple of weeks, and that streak continued in Week 15, as he ran for just 21 yards on an abysmal 2.3 yards per carry. Christian McCaffrey wasn't efficient either (rushing for 73 yards on 3.3 yards per carry), but he at least found the end zone.\n\nSimmons was wide open in the back of the end zone to catch the second touchdown of his career. That's inexcusable. Luke Gifford was the player closest to Simmons, so he should get the most blame, but no one should be happy after that play.\n\nMore 49ers: Kyle Shanahan says 2025 49ers aren't the team he's been most proud of\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: Worst performances from 49ers' unsatisfying win vs. Titans in Week 15",

    "fullText": "Want to call someone a quick-thinker? The easiest cliché for doing so is calling her a computer – in fact, “computers” was the literal job title of the “Hidden Figures” mathematicians who drove the success of early NASA.\n\nBut while modern electronic computers are far faster than even those mathematical geniuses were with paper, pencils, and slide rules, there’s another type of computing that leaves it eating space dust – optical computing, as fast as the speed of light because instead of using electrons, it uses light itself.\n\nThe need for faster computing isn’t just to satisfy impatient consumers screaming to stream movies while video-chatting, VR gaming, and 3D printing. It’s to handle the Big-Bang-level of data expansion of the modern digital world. The humble graphics processing units (GPUs) in standard computers simply can’t scale or work quickly enough to meet such massive overflow. Even worse, as The Smithsonian Magazine and Sustainability Magazine report, AI data centers filled with GPUs are consuming massive amounts of electricity (mostly from nonrenewable sources) and water (often in arid regions).\n\nEnter Yufeng Zhang (Photonics Group at Aalto University’s Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering) and Xiaobing Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun). In their Nature Photonics paper “Direct tensor processing with coherent light,” lead author Zhang and colleagues reveal their computational method employing a single propagation of light, hence what is known as \"single-shot tensor computing at light speed in a parallel optical matrix–matrix multiplication\" (POMMM).\n\nThat kind of breakthrough brings artificial general intelligence one major step closer.\n\n“Our method performs the same kinds of operations that today’s GPUs handle,” says Zhang, such as “convolutions and attention layers, but does them all at the speed of light.” Instead of standard binary coding information utilizing electronic circuits using signals of ones and zeros, the researchers use the amplitude and phase of light waves to store, process, and communicate data. Doing so not only saves energy, but provides a gigantic expansion of bandwidth and processing speed – in fact, it performs many of its processes simultaneously.\n\nThe combined interactions of light fields naturally produce mathematical operations including tensor multiplications. Tensor processing organizes data into multi-dimensional arrays (think of a 2D array as a single shelf in a filing cabinet, and a 3D array as a filing cabinet with several shelves stacked vertically) called data tensors. Tensor processing is everywhere in leading-edge technology, particularly in data analytics and artificial intelligence, including natural language processing and image recognition. It’s at the heart of deep learning algorithms.\n\nHowever, current optical methods fare poorly with tensor-based tasks, rendering them inefficient for neural networks and other highly complex applications. That’s where the Aalto method offers a major leap forward, by employing multiple wavelengths of light which can handle even extremely demanding tensor operations.\n\nTo explain the difference between electronic and his team’s optical computation, Zhang uses an analogy of package-sorting to explain the difference between electronic and optical computation.\n\n“Imagine you’re a customs officer who must inspect every parcel through multiple machines with different functions and then sort them into the right bins,” says Zhang. “Normally, you’d process each parcel one by one. Our optical computing method merges all parcels and all machines together [by creating] multiple ‘optical hooks’ that connect each input to its correct output. With just one operation, one pass of light, all inspections and sorting happen instantly and in parallel.”\n\nTensor parallel (also called tensor model parallel or TP) processing is an execution strategy for deep learning that deploys multiple devices to address components of the same model, allowing them to compute larger models more quickly. Put another way, many minds make lighter work. Or, in this case, speed-of-light work.\n\nAccording to Zhipei Sun, leader of Aalto University’s Photonics Group, the new method can work on nearly any optical platform, and his team plans “to integrate this computational framework directly onto photonic chips, enabling light-based processors to perform complex AI tasks with extremely low power consumption.”\n\nIf the method works, they expect to deploy it for integration with existing hardware and major platforms within five years. Doing so “will create a new generation of optical computing systems, significantly accelerating complex AI tasks across a myriad of fields.”",

    "description": "Move marks big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as safeguard against Russian attacks",
    "fullText": "Move marks big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as safeguard against Russian attacks\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy has offered to drop Ukraine’s aspirations to join the Nato military alliance, as he held five hours of talks with US envoys in Berlin on Sunday to end the war with Russia.\n\nDonald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made” as he and the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met Zelenskyy in the latest push to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since the second world war – though full details were not divulged.\n\nDmytro Lytvyn, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said Zelenskyy would comment further when the talks conclude on Monday. He added that officials are now considering the draft documents.\n\nBefore the talks, Zelenskyy had offered to drop Ukraine’s goal to join Nato in exchange for western security guarantees.\n\nThe move marks a big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.\n\n“Representatives held in-depth discussions regarding the 20-point plan for peace, economic agendas, and more. A lot of progress was made,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe talks were hosted by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who a source said had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.\n\nZelenskyy described the concession on Nato as a compromise.\n\n“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato: these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said – adding that legally binding security guarantees from the US, Europe and other countries such as Canada and Japan could “prevent another Russian invasion”.\n\nVladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from approximately 10% of Donbas that Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country, and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.\n\nRussian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by leading western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.\n\nZelenskyy had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities, as well as Ukraine’s power and water supplies.\n\nSending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US are looking at a 20-point plan, and that at the end of this there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has had no direct talks with Moscow.\n\nA ceasefire along the current frontlines would be a fair option, he added.\n\nBritain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.\n\nEuropean allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.",

    "fullText": "“How to get better at programming?” is the question I had been asked quite a few times, and today I lay down the 8 rituals I have been following, and action items for each, to be good and get better at programming.\n\nDoing something repeatedly always helps and writing a lot of code will develop our ability to\n\nIf we don’t do something repeatedly, it becomes extremely hard to get good at it. Writing code consistently helps us\n\nSolving programming questions is about developing logic but things become a little trickier when we build a complex system, as it requires us to take our programming skills to go up a notch. Some examples of complex systems are - a Library management system, a Twitter clone, an Instagram clone, etc. Building a complex system\n\nAfter we spend some time writing programs and solving problems, things become monotonous and do not seem to challenge us anymore, so to spice things up a bit we should model something from the real world, like\n\nThere are lots of libraries and framework like p5.js that makes visual programming simple.\n\nIt is not only writing code that improves our programming skills but it is reading some quality code written by expert programmers that make the difference. Reading code written by experts improve our programming vocabulary and by doing this we\n\nThe best way to start doing it is by picking up an open-source project and start skimming the code. It is okay to not understand it in the first go but it is important to skim it a few times and get acquainted. After a few skim, everything will fall in place, the code becomes familiar and we start to understand the flow and business logic.\n\nThere is always someone sitting on the other side of the globe, who knows a thing or two more than us. Look for them and collaborate on a project. The developer community is filled with super smart and super enthusiastic developers who love to share and collaborate. Use websites like Dev.to, Hashnode and Twitter to find and interact with like-minded people.\n\nA programming language is just a tool to express business logic. While learning a programming language we should try to understand the constructs and paradigms used - for example: Functional programming, Polymorphism, Event driven programming, Actor model, etc. It is important to do so because we could pick constructs from one language and use it in another to solve our problem. For example: picking Functional programming (Callbacks) from Javascript and using it in Python to create generic action functions.\n\nWriting code before putting in some thought is degraded the code more often than not. The code written like this lacks simplicity, reusability, and extensibility. Spending some time thinking about problem statement or task at hand and having a rough execution plan always helps.\n\nThese rituals have helped me get better at programming with time and in parallel, I pick at max 3 and act on the action items. Programming is simple but being better than most is difficult. Doing it consistently makes one get better by the day.",

    "fullText": "Rebecca Ann “Burger Becky” Heineman passed away last month, after a brief but intense battle with cancer. Her contributions to video game history are innumerable; if you’ve played a video game made within the past 30 years, chances are she had a hand in its creation in some way. After meeting her at GDC in March 2014, she quickly became one of my mentors. But more than that, I am proud to call her my friend, both of her and her late wife Jennell Jaquays.\n\nBecky and I would chat about all sorts of things, ranging from industry gossip to life to pop culture to programming. I am sad that my friend is no longer available for late night messages or calls, but I’ll always have fond memories to look back upon, not to mention her valuable lessons and wisdom. Some of these I’d like to share in this post.\n\nMy “first encounter” with Becky was not with her directly but, as with most people, through her work, though I didn’t know it at the time.\n\nMy dad—now retired—was a high school band director in 1994. That fall, one of his students gave him a floppy disk with the three-level shareware First Encounter of Wolfenstein 3D for Mac, and encouraged my dad to take it home and play it. Dad played it for about ten seconds and quickly determined it wasn’t for him, but knowing my penchant for gaming, he let me give it a try instead. My sister and I played through those three levels over and over through the rest of that year. I asked for—and got—the full ninety-level version for Christmas.\n\nI had never seen a game like it before; its first-person perspective and animation (such as it was; my dad’s 16MHz Macintosh II could barely run it) blew me away and set my expectations for what a computer game could be. Yet at that time, young me thought that software creation was the work of teams of white-coated scientists in sterilized laboratories like I saw in cartoons; surely this game had to have been developed by a large company armed with legions of workers. After all, the game opened with logos for two very legitimate-looking studios: MacPlay, and id Software. Still, the seed was planted in my head as I slowly taught myself programming that maybe, someday, I could be good enough to work for a company making something as enthralling as Wolfenstein.\n\nMy first interaction with Becky would come several years later, in 2001.\n\nI was following Becky on social media by this time, but I received an unsolicited message from her on Facebook in September 2013. Seems she had seen the news about the Keen source code, and wanted to talk. 😀 I was more than willing to chat, especially knowing that she had the source code to the Mac version of Wolfenstein 3D she had done almost a decade prior. I finally met Becky in person for the first time at GDC 2014, ambushing her after a panel she was on at Moscone North. She fortunately recognized me and we became Facebook friends very shortly after that, instantly bonding over game programming and industry history. At GDC 2016 I offered to buy her dinner at Buca di Beppo; the deal we arranged was that I’d provide the food, and she would provide the entertainment in the form of war stories. 😀 I got to learn the “true Hollywood story” of the Mac versions of not only Wolfenstein 3D, but of the cancelled port of Half-Life. Someday maybe I’ll write a bit about what I learned that night.\n\nI shipped The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime on DVD and GoG in late 2013 to coincide with The Journeyman Project’s 30th anniversary. The production of that by itself warrants its own story, but leading up to the fall of 2016 I was putting the finishing touches on a version for Steam that integrated the Steamworks API for achievements, cloud saves, and controller support. It was with the lattermost that I was having trouble; I encountered, verified, and documented—with reliable repro steps—a bug in Steamworks’s controller code… but could not find a way to communicate any of this to Steamworks engineers at Valve! The official way to report bugs, as it was explained to me, was to make a post on Steam’s forums. I did so, but was met with fellow programmers and non-programmers—none of whom from Valve—advising me to follow the same steps outlined in the Steamworks documentation with which I was well familiar. Ugh. No amount of my explaining “no, I found a legitimate bug here” would get me an audience with an engineer who could help upstream a patch.\n\nWith myself going nowhere through the “official” channels, I realized: Steam Dev Days is coming up in October 2016. I registered myself and scored an invitation to Valve’s developer conference in Seattle. For the price of round-trip plane tickets, my goal was to track down and corner a Steamworks programmer and show them the bug I was fighting. I managed to do so; after waiting in line for a couple hours (most folks were there to talk about Valve’s forays into virtual reality) it took only 30 seconds to demonstrate and explain the problem to the engineer, and sure enough, two weeks later the release notes of the latest version of the Steam client indicated my bug was fixed. ❤️\n\nBecky and Jennell were living in a high-rise apartment in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. They graciously offered to let me stay with them, which was great because my visit was pretty low-budget anyway. That evening, I arrived at their apartment complex, but because Becky was out running an errand, nobody was there to meet me. The neighborhood was perhaps not the safest in town; not that I was worried for myself, but I preferred being indoors at that time of the night. The complex wouldn’t let me in without somebody to come get me, so Jennell came down to greet me, and it was here that I met Jennell for the first time. We talked for hours about her time at id Software, and stories—with varying degrees of “juiciness”—about her experiences there.\n\nBecky and Jennell moved down to El Cerrito in 2018. I loved this; it meant they lived close enough to me that I could hang out with them a lot more often, which I did. I would often deliver them food, watch their place, and grab any delivered packages while they were away. Becky likewise came down to my housewarming in 2018.\n\nTheir archives took up their entire two-car garage, but Becky and Jennell spent most of their time in the front room both doing what they loved most: making games and caring for their cats. Jennell also liked to make and paint miniatures. Years ago, at SVVR 2016, I had myself 3D scanned in a couple of different poses. I sent Jennell one of the files and, on one visit, was delighted to find a tiny painted 3D-printed miniature of myself in her collection, done up to resemble a zombie.\n\nI drove Becky and Jennell up to Portland for the October 2018 Portland Retro Gaming Expo in my 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse. They in turn let me stay with them in their room at the Crowne Plaza downtown. We went to Prime Rib + Chocolate Cake for dinner (RIP), and the next day I joined Becky with David Crane, Garry Kitchen, and other Activision alumni for lunch at the Red Robin across from the convention center.\n\nBecky bought herself a boxed LaserDisc player at the show, and sat with it in the back seat of my Eclipse the whole ride home. Poor Jennell rode in the front seat and was uncomfortable most of the ride, owing to her stature, though she opted to recline as much as she could for as long as she could during the return trip.\n\nIn 2020, Becky and Jennell moved to the Dallas area into the home that Jennell had designed during her time at id Software. Becky would appear at several QuakeCons after that and we’d often hang out; I’d always save her a spot next to me in the BYOC, and she got to meet several members of my Quake clan as well as catch up with friends of hers connected to id, Microsoft, and the 90s gaming scene. One QuakeCon in particular stands out to me: in 2023, I made a point to get lunch with Becky and Jennell at the nearest Torchy’s Tacos. That turned out to be the last time I’d ever see Jennell; she sadly passed away in January 2024. Becky and I continued to hang out whenever I was in Dallas, usually preferring Torchy’s again in memory of that first lunch with her and Jennell. She would also occasionally host her Burgertime streams where I participated in the chat, and when gossip got “too hot for TV” we’d talk on the phone every now and again.\n\nLike most folks close to her, I learned of her cancer diagnosis via her social media announcement. In my last phone call with her, I asked how she was feeling and expressed how confident I was that she’d beat it given how prompt she was with her discovery and medical attention. She continued to have an upbeat attitude and sense of humor in spite of two rounds of chemotherapy and the ultimately unfortunate prognosis. I was in midtown Manhattan when she shared the news from her doctors that she was unlikely to make it through the rest of the following week. She and I had a brief exchange on Discord that Sunday night, but I had a gut feeling that I should try to see her as soon as possible, so upon arriving home early Monday morning I got on the first flight to Dallas.\n\nI made it to the hospital just in time to see Becky and say goodbye. Along with several members of her family, I was with her two hours later when she passed that Monday afternoon.\n\nAs I’m writing this, it still hasn’t quite hit me that she’s gone. Her work endures, and there is so much that she created and put out into the world that memories of her will linger probably well after I have left this earth. The late-night Discord chats, the GDC dinners and meet-and-greets, the random shenanigans, encounters at nerdy conventions… there will always be an empty spot—both physically and metaphysically—in these places from now on. I owe a lot of my career in games to Burger Becky, and with her passing, the world has suffered a great loss. But for all that the loss of Becky has taken from us, she has put so much back into the world. Over the past month I’ve met a number of her friends—both industry and not—who through very personal stories have corroborated just how generous of a person she was. I used to selfishly think I was her protégé, but she was a mentor to so many more people both in their careers and in life. I will miss her greatly, but as long as her memories persist and I pay forward her generosity, she’ll always be with me in some form. I hope that in this way I can introduce new friends to Becky who weren’t as lucky to have met her in real life.\n\nRest in power, Burger Becky. Narf! ❤️",

    "title": "Dark mode is essential, not a design preference",
    "description": "Dark mode is often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a necessity or assistive technology.",
    "fullText": "Dark mode has emerged as one of the most significant accessibility considerations in digital design, yet it is still often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a fundamental feature. Many organisations adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure accessibility compliance, but compliance does not always equate to usability.\n\nFor blind and low-vision users, as well as some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode is not just a preference—it is a necessity. It reduces glare, enhances contrast, and extends the time users can comfortably engage with digital content. Without it, users experience fatigue, headaches, and even an inability to complete tasks, ultimately leading to frustration, abandonment, and exclusion from digital services.\n\nWhen we speak directly to users with lived experience, the importance of dark mode becomes even clearer.\n\nDaniel describes why his phone is permanently set to dark mode:\n\n“My phone's permanently set on a dark mode to reduce the glare of any of the white screens or anything just blasting me in the eyes. It helps me use screens for longer so my eyes don't get as fatigued at the end of the day. Even people who have lost 99% of their vision still have a light sensitivity.”\n\nThis statement challenges a common misconception about blindness—many blind individuals still have some residual vision, and light sensitivity remains a significant issue. For them, bright screens are not just inconvenient; they are painful and actively reduce their ability to engage in digital work and communication.\n\nDan emphasises the connection between screen brightness and headaches and fatigue:\n“When you have this bright light just blasting you in the eyes, it's painful, it gives you headaches. Most of your job you're doing these days, you're looking at a computer screen. There are very few jobs where you're not looking at a computer screen. So if you want to extend how long you're able to do that work for, you need to try and get the most favourable conditions for your eyes.”\n\nThis highlights the occupational accessibility barriers that bright screens create. Digital tools should empower people to work efficiently, not force them into discomfort and early fatigue.\nAnother challenge with bright white backgrounds is the way it affects readability:\n“A bright white background is an issue because it causes bleeding into the other colours. So if you have thin black writing on a white background, the white's so bright that it kind of makes it hard to look at the black writing.”\n\nThis phenomenon, known as halation, makes text appear blurred or distorted for many users, reducing legibility and comprehension. Conversely, dark backgrounds with white text provide greater clarity. Patrick, who has a degenerative eye condition explains:\n“White text on a black background doesn't just look cool, it's much easier on the eyes. When I used white on black, it was easier because the print would stand out much more. Even looking at the time was much easier. The numbers would just jump at you.”\n\nFor users with low vision, neurodivergent conditions like dyslexia, and even those experiencing age-related vision decline, dark mode significantly improves readability and usability.\n\nDespite dark mode's widespread popularity, there is surprisingly little formal research or quantitative data on its accessibility benefits. However, after aggregating insights across multiple See Me Please user testing projects—each involving 18 diverse participants, including 3 blind, 3 with low vision, 3 neurodivergent, 3 Deaf or Hard of Hearing, 3 over 70, and 3 with limited English proficiency—we were struck by how often dark mode emerged as the most requested feature. It was consistently the top accessibility request across companies, often ranking higher than other common accessibility improvements. Based on our experience, we estimate that around 75% of our low vision testers and at least half of our blind testers express a strong preference or need for dark mode.\n\nThis aligns with broader user preferences, as many others—including neurodivergent users and those sensitive to screen brightness—also value dark mode for comfort and usability. While accessibility standards often overlook dark mode, our findings suggest it is a critical feature that enhances real-world usability for a wide range of users.\n\nDesign and development teams only have so much capacity, and when considering investments in accessibility, it's crucial to prioritise features that deliver the greatest impact for users. Our user testing strongly suggests that dark mode is not just a preference but a necessity, resonating far more than the collective value placed on embedded read-aloud features, which are often included on websites but rarely requested by people with a disability with the same urgency. If organisations are weighing accessibility investments, particularly in enterprise settings, thinking about how dark mode can be integrated—at least in new applications—could provide far greater usability benefits than other commonly implemented accessibility features\n\nWCAG provides an essential foundation for digital accessibility, yet it does not specifically require dark mode support. While it recommends sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.1, Success Criterion 1.4.3), the standard does not ensure that interfaces are comfortable for all users.\nStudies on dark mode’s impact show that:\n\nDespite these benefits, many organisations assume meeting WCAG contrast requirements is enough. However, true accessibility is about usability, not just compliance. If a user is technically able to read content but experiences discomfort, pain, or excessive strain, that content is not truly accessible.\n\nWithout dark mode, users often face severe consequences:\n\nFor businesses and government agencies, failing to offer dark mode creates barriers to service access, particularly for those who rely on assistive technologies.\n\nMany users rely on plug-ins and third-party tools like Dark Reader, Midnight Lizard, and Stylus to force dark mode on websites that don’t natively support it. While these tools provide short-term solutions, they are essentially overlays, which introduce several accessibility issues.\n\nOverlays modify the display at the browser level, rather than adjusting the UI in a way that is intended, tested, or optimised by the original developers. This can cause:\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about overlays is that they solve accessibility problems. In reality, they often introduce new barriers rather than removing them.\n\nThe key difference between pushing colour inversion with a plug-in versus native dark mode comes down to control and consistency. Colour inversion, when applied through a plug-in or system-wide setting, works as an overlay that forcibly inverts colours at the browser level rather than adjusting the UI as intended. This can cause significant distortions to images, icons, and visual elements, often making essential content unreadable— for example, a blue sky might turn orange, and important graphs or charts may lose their meaning. Additionally, colour inversion frequently results in inconsistent styling, breaking UI elements, making text difficult to read, and creating poor contrast ratios that worsen accessibility instead of improving it. Users often find themselves constantly adjusting settings, toggling between modes just to complete simple tasks, leading to unnecessary frustration and cognitive load.\n\nIn contrast, native dark mode is designed intentionally within an application to provide a seamless and accessible experience. It ensures proper contrast and readability, preserving the original intent of the design while keeping images and key visual cues intact. Native dark mode works smoothly with assistive technologies, including screen readers, and prevents the need for users to rely on third-party fixes. While plug-in-based colour inversion can serve as a temporary workaround, it is ultimately a patchwork solution that introduces new usability issues, whereas native dark mode provides a structured, user-friendly approach that truly enhances accessibility.\n\nAnother common workaround is colour inversion, available in operating system accessibility settings. This setting flips light to dark and vice versa, making bright screens easier to tolerate. However, this also inverts images, icons, and visual elements, which can:\n\nThis constant toggling between modes adds unnecessary cognitive load and frustration, making simple tasks time-consuming and exhausting.\n\nInstead of relying on overlays and forced inversion, websites and apps should natively support dark mode in their design. A well-implemented dark mode ensures that all visual elements are designed intentionally, avoiding the distortions caused by inversion, colour contrast and legibility are optimised for all users and dark mode can be toggled at the user’s preference, rather than relying on inefficient and frustrating workarounds.\n\nGlobally, over 2.2 billion people have some form of vision impairment, and 1 in 5 people are neurodivergent. Many of these individuals benefit from dark mode, making it a high-impact accessibility feature.\nMoreover, the value of offering dark mode and benefit so many more users. For example\n\nDark mode is not just a design trend—it is a fundamental accessibility need. While WCAG provides a great starting point, lived experience must drive digital accessibility efforts. By offering native dark mode support, organisations can create truly inclusive digital experiences and ensure that all users can engage comfortably and effectively.\n\nAs Mary, our wise blind tester said\n“We know what we need and we know what we want from programmes or apps. So it is always best to ask the user.”\n\nLets start listening on those who rely on accessible online services, rather than obsessing over WCAG conformance.",

    "description": "The two-time Emmy winner and Oscar nominee and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Brentwood home.",
    "fullText": "Rob Reiner, who directed such beloved Hollywood classics as This Is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me and When Harry Met Sally after starring in the trailblazing sitcom All in the Family, died Sunday along with his wife, Michele, in their Brentwood home, TMZ reported. He was 78.\n\nReiner and his wife, 70, were found dead in their home on Chadbourne Avenue, with the couple “suffering lacerations consistent with a knife,” law enforcement sources told TMZ. The Los Angeles Fire Department had been called to their house at about 3:30 p.m., and LAPD Robbery Homicide Division detectives were investigating.\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987), Misery (1990), the Oscar best picture nominee A Few Good Men (1992), The American President (1995) and The Bucket List (2007) also were among Reiner’s 20-plus directing credits.\n\nReiner was also a co-founder of Castle Rock Entertainment, the production company behind such films as City Slickers (1991), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Waiting for Guffman (1996), Miss Congeniality (2000), Best in Show (2000), Michael Clayton (2007) and Seinfeld, one of the most lucrative television properties of all time.\n\nFrom the outset of his feature directorial career with This Is Spinal Tap (1984), Reiner seemed to reimagine Hollywood standards, creating and starring in the first mainstream mockumentary — a rock ’n’ roll satire so dead-on, film critic Roger Ebert called it “one of the funniest movies ever made.” From there, he would move seamlessly from comedy to drama, from fantasy to horror, as few directors ever have.\n\nReiner would establish yet another benchmark — this time for romantic comedies — with When Harry Met Sally (1989), screenwriter Nora Ephron’s ode to true love (based loosely on her and Reiner’s lives) that starred Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.\n\nHis biggest box office hit, the gripping courtroom drama A Few Good Men, based on Aaron Sorkin’s 1989 play and starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, could not have been more different.\n\nSome of Reiner’s movies took a while to capture the world’s attention. The Princess Bride, his timeless fairy tale adventure that was based on the William Goldman novel and starred Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin and Peter Falk, was one of several films that grew in popularity over decades on the way to cult status.\n\nOn television, Reiner played to some of the biggest audiences in history, first in the role of Michael “Meathead” Stivic, the liberal antagonist of Carroll O’Connor’s Archie Bunker, on CBS’ All in the Family, and then as a ground-floor executive on NBC’s Seinfeld, which he fought to keep on the air.\n\n“We knew we had a great show,” Reiner told Howard Stern in 2016.\n\nBut after a rocky launch in the summer of 1989, the network was concerned that Seinfeld — famously a show “about nothing” — was a misfire. After four episodes, it was on the brink of cancellation.\n\n“I went in there and had a screaming crazy thing with [NBC president] Brandon Tartikoff,” Reiner said. “And I promised him — there will be stories!”\n\nIn 1993, Reiner and Castle Rock partners Andrew Scheinman, Alan Horn, Glenn Padnick and Martin Shafer sold their company to broadcast mogul Ted Turner for about $160 million. (It became part of Time Warner when it acquired Turner Broadcasting in 1996.)\n\nThe principals stayed on, holding to their original ideal: to make independent movies outside the traditional studio system. But after a run of poorly performing films starting in the late ’90s, Castle Rock initiated layoffs and eventually was absorbed into Warner Bros.\n\nIn 2020, Reiner relaunched the company and revived its film division a year later, with Spinal Tap II: The End Continues (2025) among its offerings.\n\n“There’s not one film that I’ve ever made that could get made today by a studio, not one — even A Few Good Men,” Reiner said. “Every movie that I make, have made and will make is always going to be independently financed.”\n\nThroughout his behind-the-camera career, Reiner continued as a working actor. He played the well-intentioned plastic surgeon Dr. Morris Packman, who affectionately spars with Goldie Hawn, in The First Wives Club (1996); Tom Hanks’ pal in Ephron’s Sleepless in Seattle (1993); and the father of Zooey Deschanel on the 2011-18 Fox sitcom New Girl.\n\nHe was particularly memorable in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) as stockbroker Max Belfort in scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill that were largely improvised.\n\nReiner’s sense of what worked onscreen was honed early on — first at home as the oldest child of comedy icon Carl Reiner and later around his dad’s close friends, among them Sid Caesar, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks and the most influential of all, Norman Lear, the TV auteur whose 1970s activist comedies All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Good Times and Maude sparked seismic shifts in popular culture.\n\n“Norman was the first guy who recognized that I had any talent,” Reiner wrote for The Hollywood Reporter in the wake of Lear’s 2023 death, noting that he viewed him as “a second father.”\n\n“It wasn’t just that he hired me for All in the Family,” Reiner told American Masters in 2005. “It was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.”\n\nAs the Hollywood scion forged his directing career, it was Lear who put up the money for Stand by Me (1986) and Reiner’s other early films, including the John Cusack-Nicollette Sheridan romp The Sure Thing (1985), lauded for elevating the teen comedy genre.\n\nStand by Me — regarded as among the finest of coming-of-age movies — marked Reiner’s ascent into Hollywood’s highest ranks, no longer just a sitcom actor or the genial ex-husband of a fellow TV comic, Penny Marshall, star of Laverne & Shirley. (Marshall too would go on to become a top Hollywood director.)\n\nFamed author-screenwriter Goldman, who penned the Misery screenplay, said Reiner became a success because his work is “funny, but not simpy.”\n\n“His films have a certain comedy style … a sweetness and toughness,” Goldman told The New York Times in 1987. “Stand by Me is not just about four kids coming of age before junior high school — they’re going to see a corpse. If John Hughes had made Stand by Me — and I’m not knocking Hughes — they would have been searching for a convertible.”\n\nStephen King, author of the 1982 novella The Body (on which Stand by Me was based) and the 1987 novel Misery, became one of Reiner’s most-steadfast collaborators.\n\nAmong other King books turned into movies by Castle Rock — Reiner named the company for the fictional setting in many of the author’s novels — were Shawshank, The Green Mile (1999)and Dolores Claiborne (1995).\n\nAfter several false starts, King finally agreed to develop Misery for the screen, but only if Reiner put “his name on it” as producer or director.\n\n“It was a very personal book to him,” Reiner told TCM in 2021. “It was all about himself as a writer and feeling trapped … And so he let us option the book for $1. In fact, I think we made seven Stephen King films, and each one of them we got an option for $1.”\n\nThe 1990 Kathy Bates-James Caan starrer remains one of Hollywood’s finest horror pieces, with Bates winning an Oscar for her role as the obsessive fan Annie Wilkes, who tortures author Paul Sheldon (Caan) while holding him hostage in her remote cabin.\n\n“Rob had a fantastic crew of people — people he had worked with for years, just the creme de la creme,” Bates said of the Misery shoot in a 2020 interview with Vanity Fair. “I learned so much just hanging out [on set] and watching.”\n\nBates, 42 years old at the time, had predominantly been a stage actress. At the Academy Awards, where she bested Meryl Streep, Joanne Woodward, Anjelica Huston and Julia Roberts, she thanked Reiner “for taking a chance on me.”\n\nOften the most memorable scenes in Reiner’s filmography came from his comedies — notably Ryan’s climactic moment in When Harry Met Sally in which she feigns an orgasm over lunch with Crystal’s character at Katz’s Deli.\n\nYet it was Reiner’s mother, Estelle Reiner, who landed the film’s renowned punchline: “I’ll have what she’s having.”\n\n“I said to her, mom, the line you have is the last line in the scene, and if it doesn’t pop and top everything that’s come before it, I won’t use it,” Reiner told the AFI in a joint interview with Ephron in 2009. “We’ll shoot it but be prepared, it might have to be cut.\n\n“And she said, ‘I don’t care, I just wanna spend the day with you and be with you on the set. I don’t care if it’s in the movie or not.’”\n\nRobert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947, one of three children of the former Estelle Lebost, an artist and set designer, and Carl Reiner, the comic and writer who got his start as an entertainer in the U.S. Army and then in Broadway musicals.\n\nThe family lived just off Grand Concourse, across the street from Marshall and her brother, future writer-producer-director Garry Marshall. But it would be decades before Rob and Penny actually met — at the 1970 audition in Los Angeles for the roles of Mike and Gloria Stivik on All in the Family. (The role of Gloria, of course, would go to Sally Struthers.)\n\nAs Carl’s career gained steam (he would win 11 Emmys), the family moved to Bonnie Meadow Road in the bucolic New York suburb of New Rochelle. It was the very street where Reiner would set his landmark 1960s CBS sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, about a rising comedy writer, Rob Petrie, and his beautiful wife, Laura.\n\n“Basically he wrote his own life in The Dick Van Dyke Show,” Rob Reiner said of his father. “And my mother was Mary Tyler Moore.”\n\nRob got his start as an apprentice at the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania and with small guest roles on such shows as That Girl, Room 222 and The Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nAfter UCLA Film School in 1967, he was paired with another young comic, Steve Martin, as a writing team on CBS’ The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The two were barely out of their teens.\n\nThe All in the Family role, for which Reiner would win two Emmys, followed in 1971. Convinced the show’s incendiary subject matter would be rejected by viewers, he initially viewed the gig as a stopgap to tide him over between writing gigs.\n\nWhen the sitcom became a hit (Reiner stayed for eight of its nine seasons), he continued writing anyway, penning four episodes of the show and co-writing (with Garry Marshall and Phil Mishkin) the first episode of ABC’s Happy Days in 1974.\n\nAs a filmmaker notably surrounding himself with many of the industry’s top writers — Goldman, King, Sorkin, Ephron, Crystal — Reiner showcased their dialogue to everlasting effect.\n\nThe Princess Bride’s “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die”; Misery’s “I’m your No. 1 fan”; A Few Good Men’s “You can’t handle the truth”; and When Harry Met Sally’s “I’ll have what she’s having” (Crystal actually came up with that line) reigned in pop culture for decades.\n\nBut as Penny Marshall would humorously point out, no matter how substantive their accomplishments, “For me, all they say is ‘Laverne,’ and for Rob … it’s ‘Meathead,’” she told the New Yorker in 2012. “We’re stuck with it.”\n\nThe couple performed together infrequently but did co-star in the well-received 1978 romantic comedy More Than Friends. The ABC telefilm, written by Reiner and Mishkin and directed by James Burrows, was something of a precursor to When Harry Met Sally, about childhood pals unsure if they should pursue love as adults.\n\nReiner also made an appearance as “Sheldn” (no “o”), the fiancé of Penny’s Myrna Turner, on Garry Marshall’s ABC series The Odd Couple.\n\nTheir 10-year marriage came to an end in 1981 — amid tension as Laverne & Shirley shot Marshall to superstardom while Reiner was quietly forging his post-sitcom film career.\n\nUpon Marshall’s death in 2018, Reiner professed his admiration for her, tweeting “so sad about Penny.” He added, “I loved Penny. I grew up with her. She was born with a great gift. She was born with a funny bone and the instinct of how to use it. I was very lucky to have lived with her and her funny bone. I will miss her.”\n\nThe couple were the parents of actress Tracy Reiner, born in 1964 to Marshall during a brief first marriage and adopted by Reiner soon after their 1971 wedding.\n\nIn 1989, Reiner married Michele Singer, a photographer whom he met on the set of When Harry Met Sally. He said she was the inspiration for the film’s happily-ever-after script change. In 2020, she joined Reiner in running Castle Rock. The couple had three children, Nick, Jake and Romy.\n\nA lifelong political activist who with King was among the public figures to urge President Joe Biden to hand the 2024 re-election reins to Kamala Harris, Reiner rarely missed a week on social media, penning calls to action on a range of social justice issues for his millions of followers.\n\nHe was among Hollywood’s most vigorous and constant voices opposing Donald Trump.\n\nAmong his other causes, Reiner was the co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which fought to overturn California’s ban on same-sex marriage. In the late-’90s, he and his father were activists for higher taxes on cigarettes — money that was earmarked for prenatal care.\n\nHis advocacy was often part of his writing and filmmaking, from his earliest days with the Smothers brothers to LBJ (2016) and Shock and Awe (2017), about journalists investigating the Bush administration’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nReiner was often a Hollywood peacemaker, well known for putting actors and crew at ease. When Bates and Caan clashed early in the production of Misery (she liked rehearsing; he preferred winging it), Reiner brokered a wary peace while using the tension to elicit superb performances.\n\n“I want everyone around me to feel comfortable and happy,” he told The Guardian in 2018. “People only act up out of insecurity, and when they make it difficult, I just say, ‘We’re playing make-believe here — enjoy yourself!’”",

    "fullText": "GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo on Sunday said he had declared a state of emergency in two municipalities in western Guatemala a day after armed men attacked a military post and a police station, cut off roads and hijacked buses, killing at least five people.\n\nCriminal gangs are attempting to force security forces to withdraw in order to take control of the region, Arévalo said. He said his government would reinforce security.\n\nThis state of emergency, the first declared by his government, will last for 15 days in the municipalities of Nahuala and Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan in the department of Solola.\n\n“We are at a critical moment for the department of Solola and the security of the country,” Arévalo said, accompanied Interior Minister Marco Villeda and José Giovanni Martínez Milán, the acting Defense Minister and head of General Staff.\n\nArévalo showed videos and photos from Saturday’s events, in which armed men - some dressed in camouflage or military uniforms, wearing helmets and bulletproof vests and carrying high-caliber weapons - can be seen shooting or taking cover just meters away from a busy main road.\n\nThe criminal groups are linked to extortion and drug trafficking and pose a threat to the local communities, Arévalo said.\n\n“The communities are not alone,” he said.\n\nInterior Minister Marco Villeda said that five people had died. On Saturday, the director of the National Civil Police, David Botero, said that six people had died, including a soldier.\n\nThe incidents are believed to have started last Thursday when armed men attacked the military post, leaving four people wounded at that time.\n\nThe two municipalities have had disputes for several decades over water sources and local roads they both claim as their own. These disputes have led to dozens of deaths.\n\n“In this case, there was no attack between the communities. This was an attack on the military post, intentionally and specifically,” Arévalo said.\n\nThe state of emergency limits the rights to open-air meetings, public demonstrations and events. It allows for the dissolution by force of any unauthorized gatherings, groups, or public demonstrations, particularly those involving weapons or violent acts.\n\nIt also limits the right to protests that affect free movement or public services, which can be forcibly dissolved, and restricts the right to carry weapons.",

    "title": "DNA From Beethoven's Hair Reveals a Surprise 200 Years Later",
    "description": "A tragic irony.",
    "fullText": "On a stormy Monday in March, 1827, the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven passed away after a protracted illness.\n\nBedridden since the previous Christmas, he was ravaged by jaundice, his limbs and abdomen swollen, and every breath a struggle.\n\nAs his associates sorted through personal belongings, they uncovered a document Beethoven had written a quarter of a century earlier – a will beseeching his brothers to make details of his condition known to the public.\n\nToday it is no secret that one of the greatest musicians the world has ever known was functionally deaf by his mid-40s.\n\nIt was a tragic irony Beethoven wished the world understood, not just from a personal perspective, but a medical one.\n\nThe composer would outlive his doctor by nearly two decades, yet close to two centuries after Beethoven's death, a team of researchers set out to fulfill his testament in ways he would never have dreamed possible, by genetically analyzing the DNA in authenticated samples of his hair.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary of the research:\n\n\"Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethoven's health problems, which famously include progressive hearing loss, beginning in his mid- to late-20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818,\" biochemist Johannes Krause from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany explained in a press statement in 2023, when the results were unveiled.\n\nThe primary cause of that hearing loss has never been known, not even to his personal physician Dr Johann Adam Schmidt.\n\nWhat began as tinnitus in his 20s slowly gave way to a reduced tolerance for loud noise, and eventually a loss of hearing in the higher pitches, effectively ending his career as a performing artist.\n\nFor a musician, nothing could be more ironic. In a letter addressed to his brothers, Beethoven admitted he was \"hopelessly afflicted\", to the point of contemplating suicide.\n\nIt wasn't just hearing loss the composer had to deal with in his adult life. From at least the age of 22 he is said to have suffered severe abdominal pains and chronic bouts of diarrhea.\n\nSix years before his death the first indications of liver disease appeared, an illness thought to have been, at least in part, responsible for his death at the relatively young age of 56.\n\nIn 2007 a forensic investigation into a lock of hair believed to belong to Beethoven suggested that lead poisoning could have hastened his death, if not have been ultimately responsible for the symptoms that claimed his life.\n\nGiven the culture of drinking from lead vessels and medical treatments of the time that involved the use of lead, it's hardly a surprising conclusion.\n\nThis latest study, published in March 2023, debunks the theory, however, revealing that the hair never came from Beethoven in the first place, but rather an unknown woman.\n\nMore importantly, several locks confirmed as far more likely to be from the composer's head indicate his death was probably caused by a hepatitis B infection, exacerbated by his drinking and numerous risk factors for liver disease.\n\n\"We cannot say definitely what killed Beethoven, but we can now at least confirm the presence of significant heritable risk, and an infection with hepatitis B virus,\" explained Krause.\n\n\"We can also eliminate several other less plausible genetic causes.\"\n\n\"We were unable to find a definitive cause for Beethoven's deafness or gastrointestinal problems,\" Krause said.\n\nIn some ways, we're left with more questions on the life and death of the famous classical composer.\n\nWhere did he contract hepatitis? How did a lock of woman's hair pass as Beethoven's own for centuries? And just what was behind his gut pains and hearing loss?\n\nGiven the team was inspired by Beethoven's desire for the world to understand his hearing loss, it's an unfortunate outcome. Though there was one more surprise buried among his genes.\n\nFurther investigation comparing the Y chromosome in the hair samples with those of modern relatives descending from Beethoven's paternal line point to a mismatch.\n\nThis suggests extramarital sexual activity in the generations leading up to the composer's birth.\n\n\"This finding suggests an extrapair paternity event in his paternal line between the conception of Hendrik van Beethoven in Kampenhout, Belgium in c.1572 and the conception of Ludwig van Beethoven seven generations later in 1770, in Bonn, Germany,\" said Tristan Begg, a biological anthropologist now at the University of Cambridge in the UK.\n\nIt could all be a little more than a younger Beethoven bargained for, considering the fateful request he put to paper.\n\nNever would he have dreamed of the secrets that were being preserved as his friends and associates clipped the hair from his body in the wake of that somber stormy Monday night in 1827.\n\nThis research was published in Current Biology.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in March 2023.\n\nScientists Analyzed The Obituaries of 38 Million Americans.

    "fullText": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González signed a polemic bill on Sunday that critics say is a blow to democracy and will make it more difficult to access public information in a U.S. territory long known for its lack of government transparency.\n\nGonzález said the bill amends an existing law to provide more defined rules, avoid confusion and reduce what she said was a “considerable number of lawsuits.” She said it also sets penalties for non-compliance\n\nMore than a dozen journalism organizations and civil rights groups have rejected the bill, noting that only one day of public hearings was held on short notice.\n\n“It is inconceivable that Puerto Rico’s leaders would go out of their way to harm their constituents’ access to information and degrade the quality of press freedom on the island,” said Clayton Weimers, executive director for Reporters Without Borders in North America.\n\nWith the new law, government agencies now have 20 business days instead of 10 to hand over documents with fewer than 300 pages or that were created less than three years ago.\n\nAgencies also now have up to one month to release documents longer than 300 pages or more than three years old, with a 20-day extension upheld.\n\n“By signing this measure into law, despite widespread opposition, the governor makes it clear that her interest is not in government transparency,” the ACLU of Puerto Rico said. “(The law) is not in anyone’s best interest, except for any public official who seeks to hinder or prevent the public from receiving the information they have a right to see.”\n\nEarlier this month, a coalition of journalism organizations and civil society groups sent a letter to the governor asking that she veto the bill, calling it a “dangerous infringement on the public’s right to know.”\n\nThe letter noted the bill not only doubles the length of time government agencies have to release requested information, it would also “allow the government to classify information as confidential without judicial review and eliminate personal privacy protections for those requesting information.”\n\nThe bill also removes “the government’s previous obligation under the 2019 law to provide information in the requested format, making data analysis more difficult …(and) would also allow the government to deny valid requests because the information is spread across several documents or agencies,” according to the letter.\n\nObtaining public information in Puerto Rico has long been difficult, often forcing local media organizations that could afford it to go to court despite the government approving a law in 2019 to allow access to public information held by state agencies.\n\nThe 2019 law noted that in Puerto Rico, “citizens and the press are subject to discretionary court processes that are costly and can take months when they request public information. Although the right to access information is enshrined in the Constitution, the lack of a procedural mechanism to enforce it leads to frequent violations.”\n\nThe 2019 law also stated that “many governments have promised transparency but have never committed to it. This is one of the factors that has contributed to the erosion of public trust in the government, which has become a complex, bureaucratic, and opaque structure in its decision-making.”\n\nSeveral years ago, one local newspaper made it a habit to publish its requests for public information and how much time had passed without receiving a response from state agencies.\n\nPuerto Rico’s Senate approved the bill in mid-October with 18 votes in favor and nine against, with no public hearings held. The House passed it in November after only one day of hearings, with 29 votes in favor and 24 against.",

    "description": "\"We apologize that it has been necessary to recall this product.\"",
    "fullText": "A major European grocery store recalled one of its goods because it may contain clear plastic pellets.\n\nIrish grocer Dunnes Stores and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland issued the notice for 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) packages of Dunnes organic porridge oats, The Irish Sun reported.\n\n\"Customers are advised not to consume this product, instead to return it to a Dunnes Stores store for a full refund. No receipt is required,\" the company stated, per the Sun. \"We apologize that it has been necessary to recall this product and for the inconvenience caused.\"\n\nThe products were stamped with the batch code 5284 FI, the best-before date of Nov. 10, and times between 06:00 and 12:00. The oats cost €1.39 ($1.62).\n\nDunnes, which has 138 locations in Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Spain, also recently recalled desiccated coconut items because of a similar issue.\n\nPlastic pellets in food are a health hazard. It may be most concerning, however, that the oats reached store shelves before the problem was addressed. If food manufacturing and safety regulations don't prevent this from occurring or stop products from leaving facilities after such events, it raises questions about the ability of companies and agencies to protect the public.\n\nSince plastic is ubiquitous in production and packaging systems, it is common, if not usual, for all kinds of merchandise to be recalled because of plastic contamination. This happens in countries around the world and with various products, including pulled pork sandwiches, whitefish spread, and brownies.\n\nWhile some contaminants may be large enough to see (or choke on), others are microscopic, and microplastics have been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer, infertility, strokes, and heart attacks.\n\nDunnes removed the affected oats from shelves and posted the recall information. Other pollutants, however, create more complex problems. For example, a biodegradable plastic used in food packaging was shown to reprogram mice's metabolic systems.\n\nYou can lower your risks by using less plastic, especially when it comes to water bottles, food containers, and clothing. Choose reusable glass receptacles, bring your own to-go boxes to restaurants, and buy garments made with natural fibers. You can also wash your apparel with powdered detergent — and without fabric softener — and use wool dryer balls.\n\nWhen it comes to eating, whole foods are generally cleaner than processed options.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) — Exposure to freezing temperatures near Morocco’s border with Algeria killed nine African migrants, a tragedy that rights groups in the North African country called deeply concerning and a violation of the right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe bodies of seven men and two women were found in Ras Asfour, a remote mountainous Moroccan area known for its plunging temperatures in winter, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights said Saturday in a statement.\n\n“They died from extreme cold, which their exhausted bodies could not withstand,” it said.\n\nOne of the migrants was from Guinea, the group said. The rest were from various countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, though specific information about their identities remains unknown. Morocco’s Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the individuals who died.\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants seeking better living conditions attempt to crossing illegal from North Africa to Europe, including from Morocco to Spain. Some aim for Ceuta and Melilla – two tiny Spanish enclaves in North Africa – by scaling border fences or swimming. Others attempt to reach Spain’s Canary Islands, taking a longer route through the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe North African nation’s security forces regularly report blocking such attempts.\n\nThroughout Europe and Africa, North Africa is known as a transit point for migrants en route to Europe’s southern border.\n\nSecurity agreements with the European Union have strengthen authorities' ability to deter migration in North Africa. Many who originally intended to migrate to Europe spend months or years working informally — doing construction, agriculture or domestic work. Others rely on aid while waiting for opportunities to cross the Mediterranean Sea or Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Moroccan Association of Human Rights statement said six of the bodies were buried last week and two were kept at the request of their relatives. “We will make sure that this case is followed up on,” it said.\n\nThe Moroccan Organization of Human Rights — a different association — earlier this week called for the humanization of borders, the decriminalization of illegal migration and residence, and the creation of a mechanism to track missing migrants to prevent tragedies like the one in Ras Asfour.\n\nFollow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

He added: “An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.”\n\nThe two shooters were a 50-year-old man who was fatally shot by police and a 24-year-old man who suffered “critical injuries,” police said.\n\nGunfire was heard on the popular beachfront around 6:47 p.m. local time Sunday, authorities said. Witnesses told the Daily Mail that they saw two men exit a vehicle close to the waterfront and begin firing dozens of rounds at beachgoers.\n\nNSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said that more than 1,000 people were at the Hannukkah event at Archer Park on the northern end of the beach when the shooting took place. “As a result of the circumstances of the incident tonight, at 9:36 p.m. this evening, I declared this to be a terrorist incident,” Lanyon said.\n\nFootage widely shared on social media shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the weapon from his hands, and then turning it back on him, forcing the attacker to retreat.\n\n“It’s the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen,” NSW Premier Chris Minns said in a late-night press conference. “Walking to a gunman… and singlehandedly disarming him, putting his own life at risk... that man is a genuine hero and I’ve got no doubt there are many, many people alive due to his bravery.\"\n\nExtraordinary vision reportedly taken from the scene of the Bondi Beach shooting appears to a show a man heroically tackling and disarming one of the shooters.\n\nVision circulating social media shows an unidentified bystander approaching the gunman, who had just discharged his… pic.twitter.com/GJIRYJcD0W\n\n— 10 News (@10NewsAU) December 14, 2025\n\nThe hero bystander was identified by relatives as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed. His cousin told 7News that the dad of two was shot twice and will undergo surgery.\n\n“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” said the cousin, identified by the outlet only as Mustafa.\n\n“We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 percent.”\n\nIn separate footage, two men can be seen standing on a passenger bridge while firing multiple shots into the parkland that surrounds the beach.\n\n“This cowardly act of terrifying violence is shocking and painful to see and represents some of our worst fears about terrorism in Sydney,” Minns added.\n\n“This attack was designed to target Sydney’s Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah, what should have been a night of peace and joy celebrated in that community with families and supporters, has been shattered by this horrifying, evil attack.”\n\nBondi is an area of the city with a large Jewish population, and Sunday marks the first day of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.\n\nA “Chanukah by the Sea” event, planned for Sunday, began at 5 p.m. local time on the beach where community members were set to light the first candle on a giant Menorah, enjoy a petting farm, and receive free face painting.\n\n“Join Chabad of Bondi for our Annual Chanukah Festival as We Celebrate Jewish Life by lighting up the Iconic Bondi Beach,” the event information page reads.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added at the press conference. “This is an act of evil antisemitism terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation.”\n\n“Every Australian tonight will be like me, devastated over this attack on our way of life. There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear, we will eradicate it.”\n\nTension between community groups has been increasingly strained in Australia following the outbreak of the war in Gaza in 2023.\n\nSydney has been the site of numerous pro-Palestine protests, including one demonstration in August that saw an estimated 90-300,000 people march across the famous Harbour Bridge.\n\n“The events at Bondi Beach are an absolute atrocity. A horror for the victims and a massive escalation of the hatred directed at Australia’s Jewish community,” former conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbot said on X.\n\n“There should be no place in Australia for the kind of evil we’ve seen this evening,” he added. “Thank God one bystander heroically intervened showing the good side of our country.”\n\nBondi Beach is one of the world’s most iconic beaches and a central hub of Sydney life. With close proximity to the CBD, a vibrant community, and world-class surf, this waterfront neighbourhood is known for its luxury properties and upper-class living.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the beach was packed with holidaymakers and locals cooling off in the water from the 90-degree heat when the shooting began.\n\nVideo footage of the incident shows hundreds of people sprinting across the white sand for cover as shots ring out in the background.\n\nWitnesses say dozens of shots were fired, while other imagery shows bullets and casings from high-powered rifle weaponry on the floor.\n\n“For twenty minutes, they shoot, shoot. Change magazines and just shoot,” one Israeli eyewitness told a 7 News journalist who was on the scene.\n\n“It’s terrible. In the middle of Bondi. It’s terrible.”\n\nThis community is no stranger to tragedy. The Bondi neighborhood was the subject of a mass stabbing incident in April of last year, with six people stabbed to death and 12 people injured at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre. That incident was not considered a terror attack.\n\nMass shootings are rare in Australia following the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996 in which 35 people were shot dead and a further 23 wounded. In the immediate aftermath of that event, then Prime Minister John Howard implemented a mandatory firearm buyback scheme which saw 650,000 newly prohibited firearms removed from circulation in Australia.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nConsumer confidence dropped sharply in November, falling to its lowest point since April, when concern over President Trump’s tariffs was driving economic anxiety (1).\n\nPossibly as a result, Americans have pulled back on spending. A delayed report from the Department of Commerce shows that while consumer spending rose 0.02% from the previous month, sales are sluggish compared to the 0.6% increase recorded in July and August and 1% increase in June (2).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nWhat are they doing with their money instead? New research from JPMorgan Chase's Institute of Financial Health and Wealth Creation found that after accounting for inflation, savings and checking balances have essentially been stagnant for nearly two years .\n\nWhen it comes to high-income households, bank balances have even been shrinking, landing at negative 2% in October 2025 (3).\n\nThe report notes that higher-income households are instead moving cash out of regular bank accounts and into higher-yield options, such as money market funds, brokerage accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) (3).\n\nWith inflation hovering around 3.0% — well above the 2% target — it seems traditional accounts just aren’t cutting it (4).\n\nWith incomes barely improving and everyday costs still high, many consumers now have “just enough to spend but not enough to splurge,” which explains why spending is falling.\n\nRather than spending more, many households are turning to investment-style options with higher returns for their cash. If you're thinking about doing the same, here are some of the most popular alternatives:\n\nThese function like regular savings accounts but offer much higher interest rates. For example, a SoFi checking and savings account can help you build your wealth base through a combination of high-interest rates, zero fees and ease of access.\n\nA SoFi account can provide a base 3.60% APY, but new clients can get a 0.70% boost for up to 6 months for a total APY of 4.30%. That’s over ten times the national deposit savings rate, according to the FDIC’s November report.",

    "fullText": "If you needed a sign for how determined AI-land is to achieve AGI quickly, it's that one of its leaders sees the speed of human typing as one of its biggest roadblocks.\n\nAlexander Embiricos, who leads product development for Codex, OpenAI's coding agent, said on \"Lenny's Podcast\" on Sunday that the \"current underappreciated limiting factor\" to AGI is \"human typing speed\" or \"human multi-tasking speed on writing prompts.\"\n\nAGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a still theoretical version of AI that reasons as well or better than humans. It's the thing all the big AI companies are competing to be the first to realize.\n\n\"You can have an agent watch all the work you're doing, but if you don't have the agent also validating its work, then you're still bottlenecked on, like, can you go review all that code?\" Embiricos said.\n\nEmbiricos' view is that we need to unburden humans from having to write prompts and validate AI's work, since we aren't fast enough.\n\n\"If we can rebuild systems to let the agent be default useful, we'll start unlocking hockey sticks,\" he said.\n\n\"Hockey stick growth\" is a term used to describe a growth curve that starts out flat and suddenly spikes, mirroring the shape of a hockey stick.\n\nEmbiricos said there's no simple path to a fully automated workflow — each use case will require its own approach — but he expects to see progress toward this level of growth soon.\n\n\"Starting next year, we're going to see early adopters starting to hockey stick their productivity, and then over the years that follow, we're going to see larger and larger companies hockey stick that productivity,\" he said.\n\nSomewhere in between the time early adopters start to see gains in productivity and when tech giants manage to fully automate processes with AI agents is when we'll see AGI, Embiricos said.\n\n\"That hockey-sticking will be flowing back into the AI labs, and that's when we'll basically be at the AGI,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "A 1,000-strong \"dark fleet\" of rogue oil tankers skirting sanctions has emerged as a new target for the U.S. and Ukraine, a senior maritime intelligence analyst claims.\n\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann warned the aging fleet poses geopolitical risks and threats of $1 billion oil spills, with the recent U.S. seizures in Venezuela and Ukrainian drone strikes in the Black Sea marking a turning point for both nations in their efforts.\n\n\"There are about 1,000 vessels worldwide that are trading sanctioned crude tankers containing sanctioned Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil,\" Bockmann told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These vessels are a lifeline for these regimes, because they’re used for shipping oil to fund the war in Ukraine, and also give money to the illicit Maduro regime,\" she added.\n\nIran Backs Maduro To Keep Latin America Foothold As Trump Increases Pressure On Venezuela\n\n\"This is a brand-new problem for the U.S., and now Ukraine has signaled they are going to target these vessels the same way,\" she said. \"There is a new strategy to deal with this dark fleet, which is the lifeline of sanctioned oil revenues, and now under attack by the U.S. and Ukraine. The strategy is all to counter what we call gray-zone aggression.\"\n\nUs Escalation With Maduro Halts Deportation Flights To Venezuela\n\nRecent Ukrainian naval drone strikes have disabled several tankers in the Black Sea, including the Dashan, part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet that Ukraine says helps Moscow export oil in defiance of sanctions, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It is dangerous and could be interpreted as a form of gray-zone aggression in order to continue to keep oil revenue flowing,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"This is all a billion-dollar oil spill catastrophe waiting to happen,\" she added, pointing to the environmental and navigational risks posed by poorly maintained, uninsured ships.\n\nVenezuela Mobilizes Troops, Weapons In Response To Us Warship Buildup In Caribbean\n\nShe said a subset of \"about 350 to 400 vessels at any one time are not only sanctioned but falsely flying flags, which is dangerous,\" because false registration leaves vessels stateless and uninsured, putting crews at risk.\n\n\"This is a huge issue for maritime safety, it’s a menace to the environment, and it entails crew welfare,\" Bockmann said.\n\nThese vessels, she said, are typically \"elderly\" and used solely for sanctioned oil trades. Many also \"manipulate AIS\" to show they are in one place when they are actually elsewhere.\n\nTrump Sends World's Most Powerful Warship To Latin America — Historic Echoes Of Regime Change\n\n\"They use false flagging, but also spoofing and manipulating its AIS to show it's in one place when it's not. These vessels have also gone to fraudulent registries that don't exist, which means they have no insurance,\" she said. \"Their certificates of seaworthiness are invalid, and they have relied on international maritime conventions to have what's called the ‘right of innocent passage’ so they can't get intercepted.\"\n\nBockmann said U.S. forces have used legal tools including Article 110 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows boarding of stateless vessels, to stop these ships.\n\n\"It's my belief that they used Article 110, and they got on board that vessel, and they were absolutely entitled to remove that vessel from global trade,\" she said.\n\nVenezuela Accuses Us Of 'Piracy' After Seizing Massive Oil Tanker\n\nIn the Caribbean, U.S. forces recently seized the tanker Skipper, sanctioned in 2022 and found to be masking its location, under a federal warrant as part of a broader campaign to disrupt illicit oil shipping.\n\n\"The recent Venezuelan tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of oil uninsured, so that's a billion-dollar maritime disaster waiting to happen,\" Bockmann said.\n\nAs reported by Fox News Digital, Dec. 12 saw Attorney General Pam Bondi frame the U.S. seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker as a sanctions-enforcement action rooted in a federal court warrant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Black Sea, Ukraine targeted multiple alleged \"shadow fleet\" tankers with sea drones, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The three tankers that have been targeted by Ukraine are all in ballast, which means that they weren't carrying oil,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"That was carefully chosen, and they were also falsely flagged, just like in the recent case of the three tankers attacked in Ukraine. That flag was Gambia. In the U.S. case of Skipper, the flag was Guyana,\" Bockmann said.\n\nFox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "description": "As our blended family grew, our holiday traditions shifted — from expanding Christmas to embracing new rituals that match who our kids are today.",
    "fullText": "Cookie baking, decorating, stuffing stockings, building a holiday village scene with Iron Man and Thor action figures — just like a huggable snowman discovered, everyone has traditions for that time of year.\n\nWe're a blended family with kids ranging in age from 17 to mid-30s. As our kids have moved from being wide awake at 5:30 am to testing Santa to creating their own holiday magic as adults, our traditions have grown and changed with them. As a result, it's all less stressful.\n\nRight around Thanksgiving, I am reminded that it's not just wonderful, it's also a wacky and wearisome time of the year.\n\nI grew up in blended families. By middle school, both of my parents had remarried, doubling the number of families to see during the festive season. By the fifth stop on a whirlwind Christmas Day in high school, my brother and I were stuffed with cookies and even burned out on opening presents.\n\nFor most of our 20-year marriage, I've felt like I'm reliving those teenage years all over again as we try to squeeze in his family, my multiple families, and the kids' other family commitments into two overstuffed days of festive cheer.\n\nAs the kids got older and added commitments to their significant others and time for their own families, we realized Christmas is too short. Two days were just not enough time to cram in all the festivities and have at least a little time left for our family.\n\nSo, some years, we celebrate what we call \"Christmas Tweve,\" the day before Christmas Eve. We spend most of the day hanging out, having a festive feast, and then opening gifts. Sometimes we have a houseful overnight, and everyone stays up late watching Christmas movies and eating my feeble attempts at pancake art for breakfast.\n\nWe are down to two kids living at home, and the number of holiday decorations has reduced.\n\nOne year, we had multiple trees, each decorated in a different theme — a candy-themed 5-foot tree, a mini tree in the kids' rooms, and a fancy ornament 7-foot tree.\n\nThere were two Christmas villages, one in the kitchen. The kitchen and living room looked like Christmas exploded in them. Every room had a few decorations — a tree, figurines, holiday towels, and a wreath on the door.\n\nThere was a time when seven of us were decorating. Now it's down to four, and we're focusing more on the nostalgic and sentimental decorations. Our tree is covered in ornaments from places we've traveled and the kids created.\n\nI used to frame the sliding door in our kitchen with the kids' artwork - cotton-ball snowmen, sparkly handprint reindeer, and a painted winter scene.\n\nA few years ago, my youngest and I had a holiday moment of tension when I displayed elementary school artwork with their previous name. They're nonbinary, and it bothered them seeing that name plastered all over the kitchen.\n\nI got creative and modified my favorites — erasing letters, trimming corners, and folding back edges. Now I display favorites onl,y and it's down to one wall shared with our Advent calendar.\n\nWhen the kids were younger, we had multiple Advent calendars — one with treats and one with toys. One year, it was Disney Tsum Tsums, there was \"Star Wars\" Lego, and then socks. A few years ago, no one was really interested, and we got one for the dog.\n\nNow, our Advent calendar is a meaningful tradition. It's the same one each year, and this year, my youngest helped shop for the candy, hopefully marking the start of a new tradition.\n\nWhen she was in college, my stepdaughter started making an annual ornament with a silly picture of herself. The perfect gift on a tight budget — inexpensive and very meaningful.\n\nNow she's a mom, married, and decorating her own place. Every year, my husband, the two youngest kids, and I put all 11 ornaments she's created on the tree — her with Chipotle burritos, in a snow globe, and with her son.\n\nA few years ago, our oldest came to stay when his spouse was out of town. I put him and his two younger siblings in charge of the holiday village.\n\nWhen I heard my youngest rummaging through their toys, I knew the holiday village was going to have a different vibe than it had in past years. Lego minifigs, Power Rangers, and assorted superheroes perched on festive rooftops and hid in the snow.\n\nEvery stage of our kids' lives means something new. Sometimes it's capped with a major milestone, such as a driver's license, wedding, or graduation, as a reminder to stop and savor this time.\n\nWith the holidays, there wasn't a big event to mentally prepare for the change. Gradually, things were different — gone were the days of classroom holiday party crafts and a big group decorating the tree. Now it's crafts from doggy day care, Christmas Tweve, and Spider-Man in the village. And I love it.",

    "description": "The cheapest ticket to attend the USA's opening 2026 World Cup match against Paraguay is $1,120 — a steep jump from initial estimates shared in 2018.",
    "fullText": "It's been over 30 years since Americans have had the chance to watch their national soccer team play on their home turf.\n\nThey'll get another chance next year, but it'll cost them.\n\nFans could pay over $2,700 for a ticket to watch the USA's first match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup against Paraguay, which is scheduled to take place in June at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nThat far exceeds the estimated ticket prices included in the original joint bid submitted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to host the World Cup.\n\nFIFA, which sets ticket prices, says it is using variable pricing to determine ticket costs, and \"may adjust ticket prices throughout the sales phases based on a review of demand and availability for each match.\"\n\nThe organization said it isn't using dynamic pricing — when ticket prices change in real time based on demand and other factors — for the 2026 World Cup. In addition to third-party sites like StubHub, which sell tickets, FIFA offers a resale and exchange marketplace for fans.\n\nFIFA launched its third phase of ticketing last week. Soon after the portal opened, fans took to social media, expressing shock over what they described as steep prices.\n\nWorld Cup tickets are divided into four categories, with Category 1 selling the most expensive tickets and Category 4 the cheapest options.\n\nAs of Saturday, there are no available Category 4 tickets for the USA's opening match against Paraguay on June 12. Instead, the cheapest ticket is selling for $1,120 under Category 3. The most expensive ticket costs $2,735, followed by $1,940.\n\nThe most expensive ticket for Mexico's opening match against South Africa costs $2,355, and Canada's opening match costs $2,170. Neither of those matches is offering Category 4 tickets.\n\nAs the tournament continues, ticket prices drop but are typically still far above original estimates.\n\nWhen the USA faces off against Australia on June 19, the most affordable ticket is $265, while the most expensive is selling for $700. When the USA plays on June 25, fans will have to pay between $910 and $340.\n\nThose prices are a far cry from what the United States, Canada, and Mexico estimated in their bid to host the tournament. The countries submitted a combined bid — dubbed the \"United bid\" — and were selected in 2018.\n\nIn their pitch, the countries estimated that a Category 1 ticket for an opening match would cost $774, followed by $614 for Category 2, $320 for Category 3, and $60 for Category 4.\n\nTickets for the final match were estimated to cost between $1,550 and $128. Under FIFA, the current final match prices — held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — start at $4,185. The most costly ticket is $8,680.\n\nDespite the hefty price, fans eager to snag tickets in this phase can purchase them now until January 13.\n\nThe 23rd edition of the tournament will take place this summer in 16 cities across North America. The first game kicks off on June 11, and teams will play until the final match on July 19.",

    "title": "Critical Role's cofounders say they faced 3 big challenges making their new Prime Video series",
    "description": "\"Mighty Nein\" is the Critical Role crew's second animated series project with Amazon.",
    "fullText": "The eight cofounders of the nerdworld business Critical Role came roaring back to Prime Video with the November debut of \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\nThe business's eight cofounders first started out streaming their home \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game on Twitch. Then, in 2019, CR raised seed funding of over $11.3 million to create the animated series \"The Legend of Vox Machina.\"\n\n\"The Mighty Nein,\" based on their second Twitch-streamed \"D&D\" campaign, is their second animated series on Prime Video.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider in November, the cofounders outlined some of the biggest challenges they faced — and the lessons they learned — making the show.\n\n\"The largest challenge was trying to figure out how we were going to reorganize, and how we introduced the world,\" Critical Role CEO Travis Willingham said.\n\nConverting a 141-episode campaign into a show for Prime Video meant covering lots of on-stream ground, Willingham said. The team had to make a \"massive shift\" in how characters and plot points were introduced.\n\n\"For us, the livestream campaign was so good at sort of feeding one little nugget at a time, and the world got bigger and bigger and bigger. We thought it was far more effective to just hit you with the larger pieces at play and let those things sort of inform the characters and the storylines as you go along,\" Willingham added.\n\nWillingham said these hints set the stage for more developments down the road.\n\n\"We are going to sort of peel back the layers of that onion as we go along,\" Willingham said. \"But we are certainly taking our time and saving things for season two as well. So we're not in a rush.\"\n\nCofounder Sam Riegel told Business Insider that the crew's longtime game master, Matthew Mercer, had created an \"incredible continent filled with politics and socioeconomic strife and war, and ruin, and religious exploration.\"\n\n\"To show all of the antagonists, the villains, the political intrigue that's going on around our characters, we needed a whole other plot line to show what was going on in the background,\" Riegel said.\n\nRiegel added that another key challenge with the \"Mighty Nein\" was the complexity of some of the main characters' backstories.\n\n\"We don't want to throw all those backstories in the audience's face right at the top, but we do want to tease out that they come with baggage and trauma and issues that they have to work through,\" Riegel said.\n\n\"Luckily, we were afforded hourlong episodes in which to do so, and I think it paints a rich tapestry,\" Riegel said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercer wove in information and plot points from the campaign that even Twitch viewers back in the day weren't aware of. That included more information on the series' key antagonists, the wizard Volstruckers, and the mysterious and enigmatic academic, Essek Thelyss, whom Mercer voices.\n\n\"We had the opportunity to dig in with the writer's rooms and the rest of the creative team to collaborate on how best to see that now fleshed out and shown and explored with the audience through this animated series,\" Mercer said. \"So there weren't too many changes. A lot of it was mainly just taking what was there or things that were sitting in my head and going, 'Alright, now we get to actually show this. That's really cool and exciting. Let's do it.'\"\n\nOne of the big challenges the team had to overcome was articulating the intricate aspects of an in-game world through animation. And that spanned character costumes and memorable campaign locations.\n\n\"When I sent Matt (Mercer) my idea of where Jester grew up and what the Lavish Chateau was, I had this strong visual in my mind,\" cofounder and cast member Laura Bailey said, referring to her character, the trickster cleric Jester.\n\n\"And then to see it in the animated series, it's so strange that they can capture exactly what it was that we've visualized for so long, and now everybody else gets to see these stunning set pieces that have existed only in this little world,\" Bailey added.\n\nCofounder Taliesin Jaffe said that he'd been \"very, very specific\" as well about how the carnival his character, Mollymauk Tealeaf, traveled with — should be animated.\n\n\"I'm famous for making very easy-to-animate character designs — I say deeply sarcastically,\" Jaffe joked.\n\nThe Critical Role team also had to look into how each character's magic was represented on-screen. For Liam O'Brien, it was crucial that his wizard, Caleb Widogast, cast magic in a manner that resembled a \"learned science,\" complete with alchemy and specific components.\n\nThe crew, O'Brien said, was also just happy to have the \"luxury of time\" to go back and revisit moments from their old \"D&D\" campaign.\n\n\"I am in love with the complicated world that this show has created — and that Sam and Travis have helmed — as we've all, in an all-hands effort, just created everything with love,\" O'Brien said.",

    "description": "Leon Spencer, an Australian dad, wants his kids to meet up with friends in person, not become products for advertisers.",
    "fullText": "The number of times my 11-year-old daughter has asked to join Messenger Kids has jumped noticeably this year.\n\nI've always believed I had good grounds to refuse, but to her, it's just a way to chat with friends. What's the harm? I've tried explaining how one app can lead to others, and how dependence on digital platforms can form quickly at her age.\n\nNow, with Australia's new ban on certain social media platforms for kids under 16, I can point to something more concrete: It's against the law.\n\nHere's the thing, though: the Messenger Kids platform isn't actually banned under the new legislation. Not yet anyway, even if its older sibling, Facebook, is. But the social media ban provides parents like me with a new reference point that normalizes our decision to say no.\n\nI'm not a Luddite. As an editorial lead for a media and communications agency in Australia, I work with content designed for social media platforms. Technology is key to what I do, and I understand the value of it, including social media platforms.\n\nBut we all know these apps are designed to be addictive and to keep users — including children — scrolling. Research increasingly shows links to declining mental health and even potential effects on brain development.\n\nI was concerned that the peer pressure to allow my children to join social media could make the decision to say no much harder than it ought to be. I'm hoping the ban will make it easier.\n\nI have two kids, 11 and 8. I don't want them to get into the habit of using social media platforms to interact with friends. I want them meeting friends in person or calling them, not becoming products for advertisers.\n\nMy children sometimes use my WhatsApp account for video calls with friends and family. Occasionally, they'll watch an Instagram reel with Mum on her phone. But I think it's important for most of their peer group interaction to occur at playdates, at school, or around the local neighborhood.\n\nI live on the Sunshine Coast, in Queensland, a part of Australia that lends itself to a rich outdoor lifestyle, year-round. It's easy for me to let my kids walk down the street to the park or visit friends nearby without constant adult supervision.\n\nAmong the other parents I speak with, the ban is a welcome shift in our relationship with social media platforms.\n\nTaking social media out of the equation completely also means less overall screen time. I'm good with this. Less screen time means less passive consumption and more active play. Yes, my kids get bored. But wait a little while, and they always find interesting things to do.\n\nRecently, after complaining for the better part of an hour about having to turn off the TV, my kids took themselves off and created a play. They wrote a script, rehearsed the lines, dressed in costumes, and performed.\n\nIt wouldn't have happened if the screen had stayed on.",

    "description": "Heath Kitson and William Lu planned a trip to Bali to learn surfing after getting laid off from their bank jobs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Heath Kitson and William Lu, who worked at ANZ Bank in the company's Melbourne office. The essay has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHeath Kitson: I managed a team of data analysts, and I was at ANZ for seven years before I was laid off a couple of months ago.\n\nWilliam Lu: I was at the bank for eleven years, and I reported to Heath.\n\nI've always said to people that it's been one of my dreams to be made redundant and enjoy some time off, but when it actually happens, it hits you hard. Part of me still thought that maybe I should just try to make an effort to find another role here. But then, toward the end of the consultation process, I had this overwhelming feeling, like Heath, that the change of strategy and direction meant that the exciting work we were doing was now over. It felt like a time to reset.\n\nKitson: We both got generous payouts, and the layoff did not hit us financially, and won't for a while. But it's definitely been a change — ever since I started work 20 years ago, I haven't even been out of work for even two weeks.\n\nLu: I haven't dived into looking for other roles yet. I'm fairly confident in the networks I have and the people I know, so I'm sure I'll be able to find somewhere warmer to go.\n\nKitson: Our outplacement service had a recruiter who had spent his career talking to executives in my position. He said that job hunting is a very deflating experience.\n\nHis advice was not to try to job hunt for eight hours a day and really grind yourself down, only to arrive at an interview all flat and disillusioned. He suggested spending only two hours a day looking for work and using the rest of the time to do whatever would make me feel happy and refreshed. He said we should be signaling to future employers: 'I'm the freshest I've ever been, I can't wait to start, I'm back from a trip.'\n\nIt reinforced to me that a break was not just part of the long service leave that was given to me, but also something that would help me get my next role. Even when I've changed jobs in the past, the companies have wanted me to start right away.\n\nLu: My outplacement experience wasn't as profound. My guy started the motions and informed me about the services available to me and the workshops I should attend. I was the one to say: 'Hold on, I'm not ready to think about this yet. Can we reconvene in February?'\n\nThe longest break I've had was when I went on my wedding and honeymoon, which lasted three weeks, so this period of paid leave was very welcome.\n\nKitson: When I started looking into how I wanted to spend my break, I knew I wanted to do something active. So I was thinking skiing, hiking, surfing, or those CrossFit camps. The goal was to find something that energizes me and to come back in better shape than when I left. I did not want to sit around drinking or being hungover for seven days and coming back more tired.\n\nLu: Heath and I had never hung out outside work at this point, but we were on a call one day after we were let go, when Heath shared that he wanted to go somewhere but did not have someone to go with. I told him that my wife also suggested taking a trip, and I would be up to go with him. We were just exchanging ideas when a surf camp in Bali came up.\n\nFor me, it was about experiencing something new as well. I've been surfing before, but to go seven days straight and have the opportunity to actually develop that skill properly, I think that was probably what got me over the line.\n\nKitson: I probably would've come on my own if we couldn't have worked something out together. But part of the appeal of this place was that we were coming to a community where we'd meet other people.\n\nLu: It didn't take too much to convince me, but the thought did cross my mind if it was a really good idea to travel with my ex-boss. But we've always had a good relationship and a lot in common.\n\nKitson: We just got back from our first session this morning, and I felt like I was not thinking about things back home and could focus on the waves. I've had a couple of sleepless nights over the past few weeks, but I think I'll sleep well tonight.\n\nLu: I wasn't thinking about work either. When part of you is just slightly worried about drowning, I don't think you can really think about too much.\n\nKitson: Our families were pretty happy to have us out of the house, since we'd gone pretty stir crazy. From friends and other coworkers, there was a little bit of friendly jealousy when they heard, and quite a few people wanted to come along. Lots of people asked us when we're doing the next one.\n\nLu: It's only our first day here, but I definitely could come again. There was quite a bit of work leading up to it, like getting visas and SIM cards. But as soon as we got on the plane, I was completely relaxed.\n\nKitson: I've thought already that if I get a job offer with a longer runway, I would go and do something similar again. I like that at surf camp, my day-to-day schedule is planned, and I can switch off about where to go and having to cook or go out to eat. It's different from a family beach vacation, which lacks this sense of freedom and rest because you're planning your own schedule and looking after the kids.\n\nLu: It's the same for me, since it's usually me who does all the planning.\n\nKitson: I'd suggest that anyone in a similar situation maintain their routines back home, but also try to take a short, refreshing break like this while waiting for things to happen on the job front.\n\nAre you based in Asia-Pacific and have a story to share about dealing with layoffs?

Picea has R&D and manufacturing facilities in China and Vietnam, per the release.\n\nThe Picea deal would allow iRobot to continue operating, developing new products, make \"timely payments to vendors and creditors,\" and meet its commitments to employees, the release said.\n\nUnder the deal, iRobot will be a private company owned by Picea, and its common stock will be wiped from stock exchanges.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company introduced the Roomba, its iconic disc-shaped vacuuming robot, in 2002.\n\nThe bankruptcy deal follows several quarters of weak sales and a cash crunch. The company wrote in its third-quarter earnings report that, as of September 27, its cash totaled $24.8 million, compared to $40.6 million as of June 28.\n\niRobot said it had withdrawn $5 million in restricted cash on September 27, after which it had \"no sources upon which it can draw for additional capital.\"\n\nIts third-quarter revenue, $145.8 million, was about a 25% drop compared to the same period the year before, with sales dropping 33% in the US.\n\nLast month, the company warned that the last possible iRobot buyer had backed out of a deal, which left it likely to pursue bankruptcy.\n\niRobot went through a failed acquisition attempt by Amazon. In 2022, Amazon announced that it would buy iRobot for $1.7 billion, but pulled the deal in January 2024, citing regulatory hurdles in the US and Europe.\n\nThe collapse of the Amazon deal hit iRobot hard. On the same day as Amazon's announcement, iRobot said it would lay off 31% of its staff, and its CEO, Colin Angle, would step down.\n\niRobot's stock price has dropped more than 50% in the past year and more than 90% in the past five years.",

    "fullText": "An X user recorded a Tesla Model Y driving through Austin's streets on Sunday that appears to show no one, not even a safety monitor, inside.\n\nSince Tesla launched its robotaxi in Austin in June, the driverless cars have always included a human in the passenger seat.\n\nThe video generated a fair amount of excitement online from Tesla watchers, some of whom immediately went to their app to order a robotaxi to see whether it would include a safety monitor (they did).\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk later said on Sunday that the company is now testing driverless taxis without human safety operators, though it appears not yet on actual paying customers.\n\n\"Testing is underway with no occupants in the car,\" Musk wrote in response to the X user who posted the original video.\n\nTesla itself responded to the video with \"Just saying.\"\n\nTesla's AI chief, Ashok Elluswamy, also responded. \"And so it begins!\" he wrote on X on Sunday.\n\nA driverless Tesla Robotaxi was spotted on the roads of Austin, Texas today.No one in the car. No safety driver.Fully autonomous.This is actually happening. pic.twitter.com/MSmRaeyJwj\n\nAccording to Robotaxi Tracker — run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna — there are 31 active vehicles in Austin, up from 29 in November. Speaking on the \"All-In\" podcast in October, Musk said that Tesla was aiming to increase its robotaxi fleet to 500 cars in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nMusk said in a video call at an xAI \"hackathon\" event last week that Tesla would remove human safety monitors from its robotaxi cars by the end of the year, according to Teslarati, a news site focused on Musk-run companies.\n\n\"There will be Tesla robotaxis operating in Austin with no one in them, not even anyone in the passenger seat, in about three weeks,\" Musk said, the outlet reported.\n\nWhen Business Insider tested a robotaxi in Austin in July, it required multiple interventions from the safety monitor in the passenger seat, including at one point when the car went the wrong way on a one-way street.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Jennifer McGuire was afraid of waiting around for her four adult sons to visit, so she booked a solo trip to Italy, France, and Northern Ireland.",
    "fullText": "I never used to know what kind of pizza I liked. A small but strangely telling detail about my life.\n\nI was always the adult ordering for me and my four sons — usually an extra-large cheese, maybe pepperoni if I felt wild. Economical crowd-pleasers. Perfect for our family, and for a single mom who didn't have the time to think about her own preferences.\n\nMaybe that's part of why I moved to Europe alone after my youngest left for college. I wanted to figure out what I liked on my pizza.\n\nOf course, it was more than that. I'd romanticized long stretches in Europe for years. I used to dream about Italy and France when I was deep in the trenches of motherhood, when a trip to the grocery store felt like an expedition, and the school parking lot was as far as I ever got.\n\nEurope felt impossibly distant from our small town. At that point in my life, even getting to the airport felt too far.\n\nBut when the time came, as afraid as I was to go, I was more afraid of staying put — of waiting for my kids to visit so I could feel like a person again.\n\nDetermined not to let fear stop me, I booked my first flight to Rome with my tax return. I packed my laptop so I could work remotely, a blessing that meant I could rent a place of my own.\n\nFirst, a tiny studio in the old town of Tivoli, just outside Rome. Then a month in Avignon in the south of France. Then Belfast in Northern Ireland. My choices were based almost entirely on friends' recommendations and the cheapest monthly Airbnbs I could find. I knew so little about the world beyond our house in Canada. I just wanted to go and see.\n\nFor the next six months, I learned how to be a person in the world without my \"mom\" qualifier. I learned how to make friends on my own — not mom friends or work friends, but actual friends.\n\nIn Italy, I joined a local hiking group and met a woman who became my closest Italian friend. Every day we walked and translated for each other until my Italian improved. Another shock: learning a new language in middle age.\n\nI felt foolish and more like myself at the same time.\n\nI walked everywhere. I learned how to be quiet inside — riding trains, gazing out the windows, wandering through museums, and drinking wine.\n\nIn the mornings, I took my coffee to the local courtyard to watch kids play soccer, women fill water at the fountain, and men play bocce. I embraced every cliché without a hint of embarrassment.\n\nI missed my kids, enough that I considered flying home at least a dozen times. But missing them somewhere new felt easier than missing them in our small town. Back home, I felt left behind. Leaving for my own adventure made me feel like I was choosing myself again.\n\nWhen I left Italy for Avignon, something softened. I already spoke a little French, which helped, and the city itself was easy to navigate. Each café and tiny shop felt like a gentle invitation.\n\nI met empty-nester moms everywhere — women who linked arms on their way to lunch and insisted I come along. They were building new lives while keeping their children at the center of their attention. I recognized myself in them.\n\nThat's what I learned in those six months: I could build a new life, return to an old version of myself, and still carry my mother-ness with me. I could be all of those people at once. I could still grow.\n\nIn Belfast, I wrote. I hiked Cave Hill with new friends and often by myself. I took a bus to the Giant's Causeway and ate fish chowder by the sea.\n\nEach day I chose something new and something familiar — yoga classes in the Cathedral Quarter, music nights at the Sunflower Pub, a book by the fire in White's Tavern on Sunday afternoons.\n\nAnd I wrote and wrote and wrote — an entire book — because finally I had the time and the quiet to write one. Because I felt like I was stepping into my own life for the first time in a long time.\n\nAt the end of my trip, I flew my sons over for a two-week visit. We went back to Rome, and I showed them everything — the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, all the obvious highlights. But more than that, I introduced them to the woman I'd become. A mom, yes, but also a friend, a hiker, a writer.\n\nAnd a lover of all kinds of pizza.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "description": "In a lawsuit challenging an Australian law barring children under 16 from having social media accounts, Reddit argues it's not a social media company.",
    "fullText": "A new law barring children under 16 from opening or maintaining social media accounts took effect last week in Australia, forcing platforms to deactivate accounts for swaths of young users.\n\nIn the words of Taylor Swift, however, Reddit would very much like to be excluded from this narrative because, it says, it's not a social media platform.\n\nReddit made the argument in a lawsuit it filed against the Commonwealth of Australia and its Minister of Communications on Friday. The Australian law is meant to protect young people from what it says are the harmful and addictive effects of social media use.\n\nReddit is seeking to overturn the country's new law, which it says \"infringes the implied freedom of political communication.\"\n\nAs part of the legal filing, Reddit also pushed back at being labeled an \"age-restricted social media platform\" within the meaning of Australia's law.\n\nInstead, Reddit said it \"operates as a collection of public fora arranged by subject.\"\n\n\"That is because it is not the case that the sole purpose, or a significant purpose, of Reddit is to enable 'online social interaction' between two or more end-users,\" the company said in its 12-page legal filing.\n\nThe company added that, in most cases, users don't know each other's real identities.\n\n\"Reddit does not import contact lists or address books. The 'upvote/downvote' functionality enables users to indicate how helpful they found the information that was posted by an end-user,\" the company said in the lawsuit. \"It is not intended to be used as a way for users to express any view about the poster themselves. In this way, Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become 'friends' with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events.\"\n\nReddit, founded in 2005, allows users to post and reply to those posts on \"subreddits\" dedicated to almost any topic imaginable. Users have the option to upvote or downvote posts and can send each other direct messages. While Reddit users can use their real names, most of them operate anonymously.\n\nThe company went public in 2024 with a valuation of $6.4 billion.\n\nReddit elaborated on its argument in a statement addressed to its users, which was shared on the platform last week.\n\n\"This law is applied to Reddit inaccurately, since we're a forum primarily for adults and we don't have the traditional social media features the government has taken issue with,\" the company said in the statement.\n\nAustralia's new law, which would place the onus on social media platforms to verify users' ages, has drawn criticism from other companies it targets as well, such as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.\n\nReddit, which says it is complying with the law, told its users that doing so could have unintended consequences.\n\n\"This law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't,\" the company said.\n\nAustralia isn't the only country considering restricting social media use among young people.\n\nMalaysia plans to ban children under 16 from having social media accounts in 2026. In Norway and Denmark, lawmakers have proposed laws that would ban social media accounts for children under 15.\n\nA handful of US senators earlier this year introduced the Kids Off Social Media Act, which would bar social media platforms from allowing children under 13 years old to create or maintain accounts. The act would also bar platforms from using algorithms to target children under 17.\n\n\"Australia is stepping up to protect kids from the addictive and harmful content being constantly fed to them on social media. It's now time for Congress to do the same and pass the Kids Off Social Media Act,\" Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a Democrat, said in a statement to Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "The person of interest detained in connection with the Brown University shooting, identified by law enforcement sources as Benjamin Erickson, is a decorated soldier who had served in a position at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nErickson, a 24-year-old Wisconsin native, served as an infantry soldier in the US Army, where he passed sniper training, had experience with firearms instruction and had served as a rifleman between 2021 and 2024, according to the profile.\n\nErickson also received a good conduct medal, participated in “security duties” near the president and assisted with funeral ceremonies at Arlington, the profile stated.\n\nThe LinkedIn page stated he planned to continue his college education at Brown University in the fall 2025 semester.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Army said Erickson had no deployments and left last year with the rank of specialist. Brown University did not immediately respond to questions about Erickson’s record.\n\nAuthorities said the person of interest was not a current student at Brown, but law enforcement sources indicated to CNN that he might have been recently enrolled.\n\nErickson took online classes with a focus on psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after graduating from high school in July 2020, and then transferred to Brown for this fall semester after his military service ended, according to the profile, which noted a variety of interests including animal welfare, veteran support and helping the poor.\n\nThe profile further noted that he had interned as a carpenter and helped out at a horse rescue center.\n\nA staff member at the rescue, the Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue in Maryland, told CNN that Erickson was part of an Army unit that learned horse handling techniques at the rescue center between 2023 and 2024. Erickson was training with the Caisson Detachment of the US Army’s 3d US Infantry Regiment, the staff member said – a unit that provides escorts for military and state funerals.\n\nA high school yearbook included a photo of Erickson on his school’s wrestling team. A profile on X that appeared to belong to Erickson posted in 2016 and 2017 about wrestling, music and political satire.\n\nOne of Erickson’s former high school classmates, Bryce Jankowski, said he recently exchanged texts with Erickson, who said he was studying at Brown.\n\n“He said he was doing good,” Jankowski said. “He said he was living at a hotel because his apartment flooded,” though he said that did not seem to bother him.\n\nJankowski described Erickson as a well-behaved, smart individual. He did not recall Erickson making any concerning statements, harboring extremist views or having any behavioral challenges. “He was wicked smart.”\n\nAfter high school, he said Erickson had told him that he was in sniper school with the US military.\n\nA former wrestling teammate from high school, who asked not to be quoted by name, described Erickson as a “pretty nice guy, he was quiet… he becomes really outgoing when you get to know him, but he’s pretty quiet when you don’t.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, CNN observed the FBI at a Wisconsin home owned by Erickson’s family.\n\nA search of court databases showed no clear criminal history for Erickson aside from a 2023 case in which he was cited for driving on a sidewalk, a charge that was dismissed.\n\nCNN’s Bill Kirkos, Thomas Bordeaux and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.",

    "description": "No matter where you live relative to the Arctic, the discovery will likely impact you.",
    "fullText": "A research team examined how increasing Arctic rainfall is driving significant changes — and the implications hit closer to home than some might think.\n\nThe researchers used climate model simulations to study how sea-ice retreat impacts summer rainfall patterns. The results, published in Geophysical Research Letters, showed that rainfall would increase by 17% if global temperatures rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, with 16% of the uptick attributed to sea-ice retreat.\n\nThis is because melting sea ice alters the \"white cold cap\" effect, weakening the region's ability to reflect solar radiation and thus pushing the Arctic toward a warmer, \"rain dominated\" water cycle, according to a Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) analysis published in Phys.org.\n\nResearchers from the CAS' Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Beijing Normal University, and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences also participated in the study.\n\nFirst author Yang Jiao explained that in the Arctic, animals that depend on sea ice for food and shelter, such as reindeer and polar bears, would \"face survival crises,\" per Phys.org. These crises would disrupt the region's ecological balance, which is vital for limiting disease spread and supporting the food web.\n\nAnd what happens in the Arctic wouldn't stay in the Arctic. Increased rainfall would accelerate permafrost thawing, releasing additional gases that warm the planet, per the study.\n\nWhile extreme weather phenomena occur naturally — and events can't be solely tied to a warming planet, as complex factors influence weather, per the NOAA — human activities are pumping billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere each year.\n\nThis has led to more intense extreme weather, according to scientific consensus. At home, this can mean sky-high insurance premiums, shortages of essential goods, and a higher risk of grid outages.\n\nThe researchers believe their insights into this critical climate issue could help in developing more accurate predictive models for Arctic weather.\n\n\"This study not only deepens our understanding of the warming and humidification processes in the Arctic, but also establishes a quantitative relationship model of 'sea ice-precipitation,' providing a powerful tool for enhancing the prediction capability of extreme weather and climate events in the Arctic,\" Yang said, per Phys.org.\n\nShould we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Former Grimsby Town and Barrow boss Michael Jolley has stepped down as manager of non-league side Bury after just two days following a backlash against his appointment.\n\nIt relates to an incident in 2009, when Jolley pleaded guilty to having sex with a 15-year-old girl.\n\nHe was sentenced to a year's probation and placed on the Sex Offenders' Register for 12 months.\n\nJolley has always maintained the girl did not disclose her true age to him, telling him she was 19. In a statement on X on Sunday, he said subsequent investigations established he was \"deceived, and at no time did I act maliciously\".\n\nHe has not been prevented from continuing his career in football and has worked at seven clubs since the incident, including two in the Football League.\n\nBury, who play in the eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One West, announced the 48-year-old's appointment on Friday.\n\nIt drew criticism on social media and Bury fans chanted for his removal as he watched Saturday's 2-1 win against Mossley in the stands at Gigg Lane. The away team's supporters also sang derogatory songs about him.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Bury said the club recognised \"the strength of feeling expressed in recent days by supporters, staff, partners and players, and the very real impact the board's decision to appoint Michael has had on individuals connected to the club\".\n\nThey included a statement from Jolley, which said: \"I do not wish my presence to deter the board from its mission of returning the club to its rightful place in the EFL.\"\n\nIn his statement on X, Jolley said his appointment had become a \"distraction\" for the club and he would \"relinquish the opportunity to become first-team manager\".\n\nBury said he had been \"relieved of his duties by mutual consent\".\n\nIn response, some fans called on board members to resign.\n\nBury said assistant manager Tim Lees would take charge of the side on an interim basis while the board undertakes \"a wider review of club operations\".\n\n\"We will also be engaging directly with players, staff and stakeholders to listen, learn and ensure that appropriate support is available,\" the club added.\n\n\"Our immediate priority is the welfare of our people and the stability of the club and our community.\n\n\"We believe this step is necessary to help restore confidence, create space for reflection and allow Bury FC to move forward in a way that reflects our values and responsibilities.\"\n\nThe club said it remained committed to \"acting with integrity, transparency and respect\".\n\nSamantha Harman - a Her Game Too ambassador for the club's supporters' group - said there had been no advance notice of Jolley's appointment.\n\n\"At the time the news was released, I was away with work and flew back immediately,\" Harman posted on X. \"I went straight to the game and made my feelings very clear to members of the board at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\"Since the announcement, I have had to manage the very real impact this decision has had on our volunteer base, including volunteers stepping down. This has been an extremely difficult situation to navigate.\n\n\"As volunteers, we are required to adhere to a social media policy, which limits our ability to publicly express personal feelings or opinions online.\n\n\"However, I want to be absolutely clear - the Her Game Too team at Bury FC was fully aligned with the concerns raised by supporters and did not stand by the decision made in this appointment.\"\n\nJolley was put in charge after Dave McNabb stepped down as manager earlier this month to become head of football operations.\n\nAnnouncing his appointment on Friday, a Bury statement said: \"Michael's blend of strategic expertise, coaching pedigree and global management experience makes him the right leader to inspire our squad and unite our supporters.\"\n\nIn his statement on X, Jolley said: \"I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work at seven fantastic professional clubs since 2009. On joining each of those clubs, I have always proactively raised this incident after being offered employment. All those clubs considered the evidence and reached their own judgement based on the facts.\n\n\"Now in 2025, 16 and a half years later, my CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] check has long since shown as clear but in the interests of transparency and openness, I still ensure that any prospective employers have visibility of the issue if I do receive any offer of employment, and I did so once again in my discussions with Bury FC.\n\n\"If prospective employers wish to view the evidence or character references that were heard in court in 2009, I also ensure these documents are made available to them.\n\n\"Football being what it is, I have become accustomed to being abused in stadia and online by people unwilling or unable to accept the facts. Since I have a clear conscience regarding the incident, I have always believed that it is right that I stand my ground in the face of the abuse I have received during my football career.\n\n\"However, now with a young family of my own who wish to attend matches and support the club, I naturally place their wellbeing above my own and take a different perspective on this issue.\"",

    "fullText": "On a weekend when Phil Foden and Cole Palmer helped Manchester City and Chelsea to vital Premier League victories, Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers showed just why he retains a firm grip on the number 10 position in Thomas Tuchel's England set-up.\n\nVilla's eight-match winning run in all competitions appeared under serious threat at the midway point of Sunday's game at third-bottom West Ham, who led 2-1 at the break against a side who appeared jaded and short of inspiration after Thursday's Europa League victory at Basel.\n\nIn the second half, however, Rogers decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored his first of the afternoon five minutes into the second half, making it 2-2 from close range after West Ham had failed to clear Youri Tielemans' low cross into the box.\n\nThen, with the final 10 minutes approaching, Rogers collected a loose ball 30 yards from goal and was given time and space to slam a powerful, swerving strike into the top right corner of Alphonse Areola's goal and clinch a ninth straight victory for Unai Emery's third-placed team.\n\nThat magnificent effort capped a fine all-round performance from Rogers and reaffirmed his status as England's first-choice number 10 at next summer's World Cup - despite world-class competition from Foden, Palmer and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham.\n\n\"He scored two fantastic goals and, for me, he is not just going to be in the squad next summer,\" said former England forward and Match of the Day pundit Theo Walcott. \"He is a dead cert to be a starter for England at the World Cup - 100%.\n\n\"He does everything, he's not just a goal threat. I like all [the contenders for the number 10 position], but one of them is going to have to miss out on the squad itself - and Rogers, for me, has to start.\"",

We should have more points, especially this season. So, I take that naturally.\n\n\"Sometimes they don't have all the information and see Manchester United with the standards they lived here, always winning. It's hard for them to see their club in this situation.\"\n\nAmorim rejects the theory the attacks make his job more difficult. His assessment is more simplistic.\n\n\"No,\" he added. \"Not winning is the issue.\n\n\"The problem is that me as a manager, I'm not doing good enough. That is a fact also and I can accept that. The only problem for them is that Manchester United is not winning and is not in the position that it's supposed to be.\n\n\"If you are winning, there is no issue.\"",
