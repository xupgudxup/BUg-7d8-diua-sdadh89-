    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings may be eliminated from playoff contention, but you could not tell by the way this team played tonight. The Vikings went into Dallas and defeated the Cowboys 34-26. The offense looks like it is finally finding some semblance of cohesion, but it still has those growing pains. However, those pains are tolerable as this team has dropped 30+ points in back-to-back games.\n\nWith the game officially wrapped up, let's take a look at the winners and losers from today's performance.\n\nNine is heating up. J.J. McCarthy has put together two nice outings and looks to be figuring some things out. In this one, he went 15/24 for 250 yards and a 2/1 TD/INT ratio. The decision-making has improved dramatically since coming back from his concussion, and when the tempo and accuracy start coming together, McCarthy just might figure things out.\n\nThe Minnesota Vikings came into tonight's game ranked 22nd in the NFL in rushing yards per game. In the first half, the Vikings allowed just 44 yards. However, in the second half, the floodgates opened, as this team finished with 138 rush yards. Javonte Williams ran for 91 yards and a touchdown, averaging 6.1 yards per carry. There are certainly some things to clean up, and the rush defense needs to be a priority to sharpen up.\n\nJalen Nailor had his first career two-touchdown game, as he finished with just three receptions for 47 yards, but those two touchdowns were huge for this offense. Nailor appears to have the trust of McCarthy in the redzone, which, with the struggling connection with Justin Jefferson, McCarthy needs to have someone outside he can depend on. Speaking of which...\n\nYes, we have a neutral selection, but it needs to be talked about. The statistical performance was not good, as Justin Jefferson finished with just two receptions again for 22 yards. However, it is the eight targets that almost makes him a winner in my eyes. Jefferson had a touchdown early called back by a penalty, and another in the second half that went through his hands. The connection has struggled, yes, but this should be viewed as a positive stepping stone as we head toward the end of the season.\n\nAs we discussed at the top, the Minnesota Vikings were eliminated from playoff contention before the team took the field, as the franchise needed the Cleveland Browns to beat the Chicago Bears. It was a rough start to the year, and it is tough to find positives in this season now that it is basically over. But these last two games should instill some optimism about this franchise and whether they can keep this going.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Vikings Wire: Winners and Losers from Vikings Week 15 win over the Cowboys",

    "title": "Could Michael King’s Local Ties Land Him With Red Sox In Free Agency?",
    "description": "Michael King wants Boston, but contract terms could decide everything.",
    "fullText": "On Sunday, MassLive’s Chris Cotillo shared a note on free agent starting pitcher Michael King, who has been linked to the Red Sox at various times throughout this offseason:\n\n“The Red Sox are among a number of teams still involved in talks with righty Michael King, a source confirmed Sunday, though there is no set timeframe for King’s decision. King, who attended Bishop Hendricken High School in Rhode Island and pitched at Boston College, has a crowded market and is sifting through possibilities. According to one source, King would ‘love to be in Boston’ but as always, it’s a matter of terms and dollars lining up.”\n\nDespite missing time due to injury in 2025, King was still effective when he took the mound. Across 73 innings, he finished with a 5-3 record, a 3.44 ERA, 76 strikeouts, and a 1.20 WHIP. If he’s able to return at full strength, he profiles as a legitimate No. 2 starter in a big-league rotation - immediately making the acquisitions of Sonny Gray and Johan Oviedo so much more intriguing ahead of next season.\n\nAs Cotillo noted, though, the real hurdle comes down to contract structure and financial commitment.\n\nBoston has several paths it could take in negotiations, but the option King is likely pushing for is a long-term deal. That’s where friction arises, as the organization has been open about its reluctance to hand out extended contracts to pitchers entering their 30s - even when one is clearly motivated to stay in Boston.\n\nBut with Boston reportedly unwilling to spend into the CBT this offseason, any consternation from the Red Sox on the contract front should come as no surprise.\n\nAt some point, the Red Sox may need to recognize how rare this opportunity is.\n\nA high-end starter who wants to be here doesn’t come around often. Meeting King’s demands would allow the front office to shift its full attention toward upgrading the offense, rather than continuing to circle back to the same unresolved pitching question.\n\nAnd while Boston has done plenty to bolster their staff in the last few weeks, King would truly be capper on reshaping a staff in desperate need of depth after running out of steam in the Wild Card Round against the Yankees in October.\n\nRed Sox 3 Most Untradeable Players This Offseason\n\nAnother One Off The Board For Boston As Jorge Polanco Signs With Mets\n\nWhile Marcelo Mayer Isn't Untouchable, Red Sox Reluctant To Include Him In Trade Talks\n\nRemember to join our RED SOX on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

    "description": "Which bets do you like the most?",
    "fullText": "Week 15 was a good one for the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nNot only did they snap their three-game losing streak by dominating the Las Vegas Raiders in a shutout win.\n\nThey also got some help in the form of the Dallas Cowboys, who were 5.5-point betting favorites at home, losing to the Minnesota Vikings on Sunday night.\n\nThe Eagles’ magic number to win their division is now down to one.\n\nThis means the Birds can officially clinch the NFC East in Week 16 by beating the Washington Commanders in Maryland on Saturday evening.\n\nIf the Eagles lose that game, they can still clinch the NFC East on Sunday if the Cowboys lose at home to the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nIf neither result works in the Eagles’ favor, they’ll have to try again in Week 17.\n\nThe only way Dallas can win the division at this point is if the Eagles lose their final three games AND the Cowboys win their final three games.\n\nWeek 16 at Washington Commanders\nWeek 17 at Buffalo Bills\nWeek 18 vs. Washington Commanders\n\nWeek 16 vs. Los Angeles Chargers\nWeek 17 at Washington Commanders\nWeek 18 at New York Giants\n\nThe Eagles are on the precipice of becoming the first team to repeat as NFC East champions since they last did it back in 2004.\n\nElsewhere in the NFC playoff picture, the Eagles got help with both the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Carolina Panthers losing in Week 15. Those results work towards Philly not falling to the No. 4 seed, which is important since that team is likely going to have to host the second place finisher in the NFC West in the Wild Card round. Not an ideal first round matchup.\n\nThe Eagles are currently on track to be the No. 3 seed. If they end up in that position, they’ll host the No. 6 seed. The San Francisco 49ers reside in that position at this moment.\n\nIt’s possible the Eagles can climb up to the No. 2 seed, which is what they had last year. But they’d likely need to win out and also get some help with the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers dropping games. Speaking of the Packers, their defense took a major hit on Sunday with Micah Parsons feared to have suffered an ACL injury.\n\nThe Eagles are mathematically alive for the No. 1 seed but just barely. The Los Angeles Rams and the Seattle Seahawks are the strongest contenders for that spot. There’s a huge game between those two teams on Thursday Night Football to kick off Week 16.\n\nHere’s the entire updated NFC playoff picture after Week 15 (note that Monday night’s game is between two AFC teams).\n\n1) Los Angeles Rams: 11-3*\n2) Chicago Bears: 10-4\n3) Philadelphia Eagles: 9-5\n4) Tampa Bay Buccaneers: 7-7\n\n*officially clinched playoff berth\n\n5) Seattle Seahawks: 11-3\n6) San Francisco 49ers: 10-4\n7) Green Bay Packers: 9-4-1\n\n8) Detroit Lions: 8-6\n9) Carolina Panthers: 7-7\n\n11) Minnesota Vikings: 6-8\n12) Atlanta Falcons: 5-9\n13) New Orleans Saints: 4-10\n14) Washington Commanders: 4-10\n15) Arizona Cardinals: 3-11\n16) New York Giants: 2-12",

    "description": "Triumphing in the NFL playoffs tends to require a degree of callousing. So while the Patriots were licking their wounds after their first loss in nearly three months, they weren't exactly crying about them, either.",
    "fullText": "FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — In the below-freezing tunnel of Gillette Stadium, Mike Vrabel held a stat sheet in his left hand and kept his right hand free for greetings.\n\nVrabel extended a fist bump to some of his players and a reassuring chest pat to others. He was not festive but he also was not forlorn. This was not the head-hanging or tunnel walk of silence in which losing coaches so often engage.\n\nIn fact, when tight end Hunter Henry looked down and shook his head after their encounter, Vrabel seemed intent on reminding the veteran: A 35-31 loss to the reigning league MVP and five-years-running division champions is nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n“You know what I mean? This is the National Football League,” Vrabel shouted as Henry disappeared into the locker room.\n\nMike Vrabel reassures his players as they head back to locker room after 35-31 loss to Bills snaps Patriots 10-game win streak: pic.twitter.com/9KBnUR8yYV\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) December 14, 2025\n\nBefore long, receiver Stefon Diggs rounded out the group of players to trickle off the field and Vrabel, too, disappeared into the locker room to address his squad after their first loss since Sept. 21.\n\nThe manner of losing warranted some disappointment, after the Patriots blew a 21-point lead and 17-point halftime lead to the Buffalo Bills and snapped their 10-game winning streak in a stadium where both locker rooms spoke candidly about the seeming inevitably of Josh Allen.\n\nBut there was also reason for the Patriots to appreciate, if not celebrate, the value of their first final-score adversity in months. At 11-3 and atop the AFC East, albeit now just by one game, New England is well on track to host at least one playoff game for the first time since Vrabel’s Titans upset them in a wild-card game six years ago.\n\n[Get more Patriots news: New England team feed]\n\nTriumphing in January if not also February tends to require a degree of callousing. Sunday’s game, in which the Patriots had a host of individual accolades but not the final result they coveted, provided some. No, the division-champion hats and shirts did not leave their boxes Sunday. But the Patriots may have received a more substantive gift.\n\n“It’s good for us,” said Diggs, who’s played in the NFC championship and AFC championship games with the Minnesota Vikings and Bills, respectively. “When you’re playing a team like that, they play from behind. They’re used to playing from behind, fighting back and clawing. … It’s been a while since we lost [and] we probably needed it.\n\n“It’s like a daily dose of your humble pie.”\n\nAre there lessons Patriots can only learn from losses?\n\n“100%,” Stefon Diggs said after loss to Bills. “It’s like a daily dose of your humble pie.” pic.twitter.com/r5y3R9q5l8\n\n— Jori Epstein (@JoriEpstein) December 14, 2025\n\nCornerback Carlton Davis, who won a Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Tom Brady, echoed the sentiment.\n\n“We don't want to go into the playoffs not having been scathed,” Davis told Yahoo Sports. “The Patriots organization hasn't been in this position in quite a minute. So it’s good to get a little taste of that playoff atmosphere.\n\n“That’s a playoff team. They go to the big dance every year. So yeah, that was a great warmup for us.”\n\nBeneath a light but steady dusting of snow, the Patriots warmed up more quickly than the Bills.\n\nQuarterback Drake Maye’s MVP case was up for trial amid a relatively soft schedule of opponents. He’d already outlasted the Bills in Buffalo and the Buccaneers in Tampa Bay. Could he also finish off the Bills at home?\n\nFinding Kayshon Boutte 30 yards down the right sideline on third-and-7 aroused the home crowd’s first outburst of “M-V-P” chants. An 8-yard touchdown on a designed run around the left end cued up another chorus.\n\nBefore the first quarter was over, Maye would also scramble up the middle of the field 7 yards for a second rushing score to double the two rushing touchdowns he’d scored in 13 prior games this season. At that point, an uninformed bystander may have confused which quarterback was the dual-threat, reigning MVP.\n\n“Just seeing the defense and trying to use my legs when I can, trying to add an extra element in the red zone to gain an extra hat,” Maye said. “And from there, try to make a play and try to get in the end zone.”\n\nMaye’s success required the Bills defense to respect his legs. That threat aided explosive rookie TreVeyon Henderson in finding creases up the middle to spring a third New England rushing touchdown, Henderson’s second-level dominance carrying him the 52 yards home.\n\nThe Patriots, up 21-0 with 5:53 to play in the first half, held a 91.1% chance of winning, per Next Gen Stats win probability data.\n\nBut that algorithm didn’t account for Josh Allen being Josh Allen … which translated statistically into rebounding from three straight punts to score five straight touchdowns.\n\nAs the third quarter waned and the fourth quarter ratcheted up Buffalo’s intensity, the Bills hit their stride.\n\nCornerback Tre’Davious White intercepted Maye with 1:39 to play in the third quarter, thwarting a chance for the Patriots to respond after the Bills had narrowed New England’s lead to three. White’s interception still set the  Bills up with a daunting 91-yard field. But Buffalo didn’t blink.\n\nAllen converted a keeper on third-and-1 and, when he failed to move the chains on a third-and-2 pass, Bills coach Sean McDermott kept his offense on the field. Facing fourth-and-3 from the 45, again everyone in the stadium was reminded that Allen is inevitable.\n\nAnd thus a 37-yard pass from Allen arrived in the arms of receiver Khalil Shakir, even as Shakir needed to stretch his arms around cornerback Marcus Jones in the process.\n\nFour plays later, on third-and-14, Allen fired a laser to tight end Dawson Knox for Knox’s second touchdown of the afternoon — and the Bills’ first lead of the game.\n\n“I saw Josh rolling out, we work the scramble drill a lot in practice and just threw a frozen rope right in my chest,” Knox said. “I had no choice but to catch that one. Just crazy scramble drill. It was just a five verticals concept. I was supposed to kind of stay on my side of the field.\n\n“Unbelievable throw by Josh Allen, man.”\n\nAnother Henderson unleashing in the form of a 65-yard touchdown (and stellar downfield blocking from Maye) wouldn’t be enough to derail the Bills’ momentum. With a 24-7 second-half advantage and heavy pressure on Maye disrupting the Patriots’ passing game, the Bills gave the Patriots a taste of the challenges that await New England in January.\n\n“That was a playoff game,” Davis said. “When you get down to the end of the season and you start talking about seeding, you start talking about division, that’s a playoff game.\n\n“Maybe we needed this loss to help us correct a couple of things. And so [we know] we’re not invincible, but still a great team.”\n\nThe Patriots want to be clear: Winning was the goal and preference Sunday.\n\n“Of course we’re not happy with that,” Henderson said after a career-high 161 scrimmage yards and two scores. “Of course we wanted to come out with the win.”\n\nBut losing a game in which they outgained the Bills 285 yards to 76 in the first half, also putting the Bills in their largest halftime hole (17 points) of the season?\n\nIf that doesn’t teach New England’s locker room the necessity of playing 60 minutes, the Patriots aren’t sure what will. Linebacker Jack Gibbens was not alone in believing that “the sense of urgency to get things fixed after a loss definitely picks up.” The blueprint that the Bills parlayed — pressure Maye into thinking about the pass rush at the expense of downfield routes, wear down a depleted New England defensive cast with extended drives — will come back to haunt the Patriots if they don’t respond accordingly.\n\nSure, Maye excites the Patriots in the present and the future, his 109.1 passer rating trailing only the Los Angeles’ Rams Matthew Stafford and Detroit Lions’ Jared Goff while his 70.9% completion percentage leads the league.\n\nMaye’s 27 offensive touchdowns are tied for seventh-most in the NFL. His accuracy, play extension and smarts to change plays at the line of scrimmage impress teammates and opponents alike. He has received comparisons to Allen.\n\nBut he’s not there yet. Because there’s a belief that teams develop when a quarterback has already proven they can win and rebound repeatedly in improbable circumstances. The MVPs of recent history have done that. There were days when one just could not explain Allen or Patrick Mahomes or Lamar Jackson or Aaron Rodgers.\n\nMaye, meanwhile, has helped the Patriots start fast and survive attempts to thwart wins. He will continue to build his arsenal of late-game comebacks and fourth-quarter elevations as Allen has in a career that’s already earned him an MVP, albeit not yet the Super Bowl title he eyes.\n\nVrabel will tell Maye, as he tells all his players, that losses like Sunday’s are part of that climb. They’re part of the pursuit of greatness and they’re part of the maturation process that will sharpen a team when games don’t just resemble playoff environments but also carry the elimination actualities. Next week’s visit to the Baltimore Ravens will present yet another chance.\n\nThat sense of resolve settled over the Patriots as the rawness of their loss softened slightly.\n\nVrabel’s call to Henry that “this is the National Football League” didn’t compel the tight end to turn back on his dejected entrance into the locker room. But 16 minutes later, as Hunter addressed reporters from his locker, he had absorbed — consciously or subconsciously — the message.\n\n“This definitely can be a kind of kick in the butt,” Henry said. “We’ve had things go our way and everything go our way the last 10 weeks, so this is definitely a reality check.\n\n“That’s a good football team. We went toe to toe with them in every aspect. But we have to give them credit.\n\n“We’ve got to get a lot better from this — fast.”",

    "description": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea from Steve Kerr about gun control.",
    "fullText": "Another mass shooting, another impassioned plea for gun control from Steve Kerr.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors coach spoke for about three minutes unprompted on Sunday night before their 136-131 loss against the Portland Trail Blazers and again called for gun reform in the wake of a mass shooting at Brown University.\n\n“With what happened last night at Brown, it’s just a reminder to me that these shootings continue to happen, and there is something we can do about them. The loss that all of the people involved [Saturday] night, the loss that they’re feeling, it’s exactly the same loss as all the Parkland families, and every other mass shooting.\n\n“Nobody asked me about it today. I didn’t expect anybody to ask me. I doubt we’re gonna do a moment of silence out there because it’s human nature just to not want to deal with this stuff. And it’s human nature just to think, ‘This is so horrible. Let’s not even think about it.’ But we have to think about it.”\n\nSpeaking pregame, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr addresses gun violence following this weekend’s shooting at Brown University.\n\n“We know there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. … I just want people thinking ‘What if it were my child?’”\n\nMore: pic.twitter.com/E2n9z62jYZ\n\n— Sam Gordon (@BySamGordon) December 15, 2025\n\nA shooting took place at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday afternoon that left two people dead and nine others injured, according to The New York Times. An investigation is still ongoing. Authorities released a man who they had detained on Sunday night, and are still searching for the alleged gunman.\n\nAccording to the Gun Violence Archive, that was the 389th mass shootings in the United States so far this year. There have been others since.\n\nGun control is something that Kerr has been a strong advocate of for years. He’s spoken out about plenty of other mass shootings in the United States in the past, hosted a town hall about the issue, drawn support for groups founded by students who survived other mass shootings, and more. Kerr’s father, Malcolm, was shot and killed during a terrorist attack in Beirut in 1984 when Steve was a student at Arizona.\n\n“The vast majority of gun owners in this country are responsible, law-abiding citizens,” Kerr said. “They have every right to own a gun. But it’s on us to decide if we actually want to take action as a country, as citizens. We know, we know that there are common-sense measures we can take that will save people’s lives. And I just want people out there — it doesn’t matter if you’re Democrat or Republican, or gun owner, non-gun owner — I just want people thinking, ‘What if it were my child? What if it were my brother or sister?’ Would you be willing to stand up to your representatives and say, ‘You know what? Enough. I’m not gonna vote for you unless you are going to stand up for gun violence prevention through common-sense laws that the vast majority of Americans agree on.'\n\n“Or are we just gonna continue to let the gun lobby run us over and not do anything to protect each other, to protect our children, to protect our future. We have to make that decision.”\n\nKerr wasn't alone in the sports world, either. USC women's basketball coach Lindsay Gottlieb, who played at Brown, spoke out on Saturday night.\n\n\"It's the guns,\" she said after the Trojans' loss to No. 1 UConn. \"We're the only country that lives this way.\"\n\nThis is far from the first time that Kerr has addressed this issue, and mass shootings continue to occur in the United States. Based on recent history, it likely won't be the last time we hear from Kerr about gun control, either.\n\nWhile Kerr knows how easy it would be to just give up and ignore the problem, especially since it seems like nothing is getting better, he ended his plea on Sunday night with a simple solution.\n\n“Don’t just look the other way, even though that’s human nature and I understand it,” Kerr said. “Think about it. Think about, do you want something done? Do you want your child to go to school terrified every day? Or do you want to actually take action?\n\n“Because that’s what a democracy is about. Where we demand that our representatives protect us. And that option is there. So, we can either just do what we’re continuing to do and let these things happen or make some demands. And so, as you’re thinking about this today, think about, what if it were your own family member?”",

    "description": "New manager Skip Schumaker has been clear already that Carter has to show that he can hit left-handed pitchers on a regular basis.",
    "fullText": "Texas Rangers center fielder Evan Carter is one of those players that Rangers manager Skip Schumaker hopes can really make a difference in 2026.\n\nEven before the team reaches Spring Training down in Port Charlotte, Fla., Schumaker has some things that he wants to see from Carter. Carter, a left-handed batter for the Rangers, hasn't been known as someone who hits left-handed pitchers consistently.\n\nFor Schumaker, that's an issue that he wants to see improvement upon from Carter.\n\n\"I think he understands that and he’s out to prove that he can play against lefties,\" Schumaker said last week at the Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla., according to Texas Rangers on SI. \"But you have to give him a little bit of an opportunity to produce.\"\n\nLast season, Carter hit five home runs and had 25 RBIs while hitting .247. Carter also stole 14 bases, showing that he has a mix of power, speed, and agility that the Rangers just love.\n\nCarter, though, has been getting over a fractured wrist. Rangers general manager Ross Fenstermaker believes that Carter should be ready to rock when Spring Training comes around.\n\nIf Carter can put up some consistent numbers across the board next season, then the Rangers will welcome him as a big producer for the ballclub.\n\nThe SI article pointed out some striking statistics about Carter hitting left-handed pitchers versus right-handed pitchers. Take a look at his numbers against lefties: 23 at-bats with a slash line of .087/.250/.087 with just one RBI. What about righties? A completely different story. Five homers, 24 RBIs in 171 at-bats, and a slash line of .269/.349/.433.\n\nThat's one whale of a difference for Carter.\n\nSchumaker wants those numbers to come out in a more balanced way. Should Carter be able to bring up those numbers against lefties, then it's probably going to get him more at-bats from Schumaker. But if Carter struggles against them, then Schumaker will have to put into effect a platoon system.\n\nHe'd have to make sure whoever plays center field when Carter isn't in there can put up some quality ABs for the Rangers.\n\nIn 2026, Carter and the Rangers want to get back into the MLB postseason conversation. As has been mentioned at Rangers Roundtable, the Rangers have two big stumbling blocks facing them: the Seattle Mariners and Houston Astros.\n\nThose two teams have dominated the American League West Division for some time. Of course, when the Rangers won the World Series back in 2023, they had the upper hand over both teams.\n\nSchumaker has been brought into the dugout to bring a new mindset, a new attitude, a new way of playing on the field. It's going to be interesting to see how Carter plays into Schumaker's plans for next season.\n\nRemember to join our RANGERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE!

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStephen Curry is doing everything in his power to keep the Golden State Warriors’ heads above water.\n\nThe 11-time All-Star was out of the franchise’s lineup for several contests due to a concerning right quad contusion, but has returned in style.\n\nCurry netted 39 points in his first game back against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Friday night, but the Dubs still fell short in the end.\n\nOn Sunday night, the four-time NBA champion erupted for 48 points vs. the Portland Trail Blazers, but once again, Golden State came out on the losing end.\n\nThat said, the Warriors’ shortcomings as a unit shouldn’t overshadow the fact that Curry recently made basketball history that's never been done by an NBA point guard.\n\n“Steph Curry has the most 45-point games by a point guard in NBA history,” Real Sports wrote on X/Twitter.\n\nEven if Golden State is unable to reach its full potential this season, fans should expect more 45+ point explosions from the best shooter of all time.\n\nCurry isn’t the type of player who can get neutralized regularly, considering he’s been tasked with assuming a bulk of the offensive responsibilities for the seven-time NBA champions.\n\nCurry is averaging 28.5 points per game on 47.3% field goal shooting and 39.1% three-point shooting with Golden State this year.

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim has faced plenty of heat for his utilisation of Manchester United wonderkid Kobbie Mainoo this season.\n\nNot too long ago, the Carrington graduate was starring for the Red Devils as they overcame Manchester City in the FA Cup final. Who can forget his injury-time winner against Olympique Lyonnais last season?\n\nFrom those heady heights, the Englishman has fallen on hard times under the head coach in this campaign. A total of zero starts in the Premier League has meant the 20-year-old is desperate to jump ship in January.\n\nHe had asked INEOS to leave in the summer as well, and he is likely to approach them once again in the coming days to find some sort of solution.\n\nIt is clear from Amorim’s comments that the England international is unlikely to see too many minutes unless there are injuries or the head coach shuffles his pack.\n\nA whole host of clubs are chasing the United No.37, and while Napoli remains his preferred destination, CaughtOffside have claimed that Chelsea are leading the race.\n\nThe Blues had signed fellow Carrington graduate Alejandro Garnacho in the summer and are now looking to add more young talents from the Red Devils.\n\nBayern Munich are also strong contenders. Thankfully for the 20-time English league champions, the Stockport-born ace remains committed to his boyhood club, and wants only a temporary exit to boost his England World Cup hopes.\n\nHe prefers a foreign club, and the co-owners are unlikely to sanction a deal to a domestic top-four unless it involves an offer too good to be refused.\n\n“Although at least 12 clubs are reportedly in the race, sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Chelsea and Bayern Munich are “leading the chase”.\n\n“It will be interesting to see if Chelsea can convince Manchester United to sell. They are looking to build a formidable team for the future, and the England International midfielder could be the final piece of the puzzle for them.\n\n“However, the player’s personal preference list still places Napoli as the frontrunner. Mainoo is prioritising where he can be a guaranteed starter as he plots his next move.”\n\nHopefully, it does not come to that and the talented star remains at Old Trafford for the foreseeable future.\n\nPossibly, AFCON departures could finally force Amorim to hand Kobbie Mainoo more gametime. And the midfielder must grab his chance with both hands when it arrives.\n\nFeature image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "description": "Ben McKevitt looks on the main stories from a highly-charged Wear-Tyne derby — what a day!",
    "fullText": "From the first minute, it was clear that the Lads wanted this more than the scared Geordies.\n\nThe match featured precious few chances for either side but Sunderland’s spirit, hunger, drive and pride was on full display. The midfield battle was won by Granit Xhaka, Noah Sadiki and Enzo Le Fée — latter of whom didn’t stop running for the duration of the game.\n\nThis gave us a wonderful base from which to impose ourselves and it’s fair to say that Newcastle simply couldn’t handle us. We all hoped for this from our players coming into this game, and they didn’t let us down — but frankly I expected more from that sorry lot up the road.\n\nThe first half saw a thundering tackle from Nordi Mukiele, crashing into the ribs of Dan Burn near the touchline, and whilst Mukiele did receive a yellow for the collision, it was absolutely worth it to see the world’s longest man limp off the pitch and apparently straight to the nearest doctor.\n\nIt exemplified the battling spirit we showed across the pitch and despite the referee’s best efforts, we outfought the poor black and white boys.\n\nIt was especially fitting to see Xhaka briefly come off the pitch towards the end of the game with a bloody warrior’s wound after a huge melee broke out between the two teams leading to four yellows. Our captain fully understood the task yesterday and was an excellent leader from the centre.\n\nReinildo was also notably fired up as expected, leaving very little in the way of caution for those he clattered into throughout the game. We even got a crunching Trai Hume leveller near the end which tied a nice bow on what was a wonderfully full-blooded performance from those in red and white.\n\nThis feels like a “full circle” moment for Ballard.\n\nHe was our best player against Newcastle when we played them in the ill-fated FA Cup contest almost two years ago, but succumbed to a couple of horrible moments in the form of a conceded penalty and an unfortunate own goal. It seemed unfair at the time, but summed up our day, really.\n\nHowever, enter 2025 Ballard: a man reborn, a defensive colossus and a Sunderland legend in the making.\n\nDuring a year in which he’s given us so many great moments and performances, I’m sure that this one will feel as good as any for Ballard, as he easily managed to swat away Newcastle’s feeble attempts on our goal, claiming a clean sheet and what I saw as a “man of the match” performance along the way.\n\nHe epitomises what the club is about days and Florent Ghisolfi’s comments highlight it — “We couldn’t just buy a Ballard from somewhere in Europe”. He’s battled through injury and heartbreak to become our most combative, intimidating defender (and that’s saying something in this Sunderland squad!).\n\nI’m so glad we have him and long may his reign at the back last. There’s only room for one “BDB” in the North East.\n\nI’m almost grudgingly including the referee’s performance here, but it truly does deserve some recognition for all the wrong reasons. Somehow, the refereeing performances just seem to get worse and worse in this league — and this display could be the most spineless of the season.\n\nFrom the start of the game, he was spectacularly inconsistent.\n\nYellows were brandished sparingly — perhaps in an attempt to let the derby flow in the early stages — but as the game developed, this didn’t seem to let up. Ballard was effectively manhandled by two Newcastle players any time he crossed the line into their box without any repercussions, and whilst penalties on each occasion would certainly have been soft, the lack of action meant that Newcastle players were welcome to essentially double team Ballard out of position and win the header themselves.\n\nThe most galling of all aspects was, however, the lack of yellows for intentional fouls which were often used as a way to break up our counter attacks.\n\nMalick Thiaw committed numerous cynical and intentional fouls, often on Brian Brobbey (who himself should’ve seen red save for the referee’s incompetence) without any repercussions. The overall effect of this saw the Lads drop deeper and deeper into our own half to defend, as we literally couldn’t launch a counter attack without being fouled without punishment.\n\nAwful, but even he couldn’t stop our victory march yesterday.\n\nA word of admiration for what must be one of the best strikers and signings in the Premier League this season. It’s clear to see why the Newcastle supporters have made such a big deal of the arrival of the German — and big Nick delivered in the biggest game of all.\n\nHe dazzled us with a beauty of a glancing header which flew past the goalkeeper, rattled the crossbar and ended up in the back of the net, putting the biggest team in the North East 1-0 up. The stadium erupted thanks to his decisive action, and I couldn’t have been more impressed with the finish.\n\nI look forward to seeing much of him this season, if that’s what he’s capable of in the big moments. Three cheers for Saint Nick during this festive season!\n\nThe pride, the emotion and the feeling in the stadium was electric and the noise never faltered. Once upon a time, the “Stadium of Light effect” seemed like a hindrance to the players who took to the pitch in our colours, but now it’s a fortress and the ultimate source of pride.\n\nThe displays were observed immaculately ahead of kick-off and the tifo may just be the best we’ve had so far — what a beauty! It was a brilliant omen and fairly indicative of how the game played out in reality.\n\nThis is what it’s all about, isn’t it?\n\nWe’re back in the big time, but we’re not just back — we’re thriving and we’re shaking this league up, driving the team on with our passion and pride and beating the Mags along the way.\n\nA tribute to Gary Rowell was conducted after the devastating news of his passing on Saturday. He’s remembered so fondly for his contributions in derbies and I’m so glad the Lads could do him proud and get the win.\n\nHe’d have loved that performance. Rest in Peace, Gary!\n\nFinally, a word on those that came down to gift us three points yesterday.\n\nTheir fans were awfully quiet throughout; the pretend hard men in the middle delivered absolutely nothing, and they were very generous in delivering the three points so gently to us on a platter.\n\nI’d like to thank the richest club in the world for their brilliant Christmas gift this year…cheers!",

But they would like to be in a better position right now, even still.\n\nLiam Rosenior in a Strasbourg press conference.\n\nAfter the game, Rosenior has clearly been disappointed with set pieces from his side this season and seems to suggest that they players are not doing what he is telling them to do and also, they are missing Andrey Santos, who was of course at Strasbourg last season but is now back at Chelsea.\n\n“He [Andrey Santos] is missed, he was huge on set pieces. Today, there are unacceptable things on corners, free kicks. My players must do what I ask. Otherwise, we’ll find others.”\n\nChelsea are apparently the frontrunners to sign one player who has played just 183 minutes so far this season, according to the latest transfer report out over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, Enzo Maresca has been warned to keep his mouth shut by one BBC pundit this week following comments he made after the Everton game on Saturday.",

    "fullText": "Whilst the players deserve all the praise that comes their way, I think Le Bris must be given immense credit.\n\nHis selection was spot on; four at the back was the correct call and Brian Brobbey did a stellar job up top holding up the ball. Leaving out Trai Hume was a bold call, but the right one.\n\nOur preparation was on point and the players understood and embraced the occasion.\n\nThis team just gets it. From the first whistle, we got into them and didn’t give them any time to think.\n\nThey weren’t overawed and were disciplined whilst getting stuck in. I can’t remember a better quality Sunderlwnd side than this in my lifetime.\n\nHard to find a negative to be honest, but I guess losing some of these players for AFCON — Noah Sadiki, Reinildo, Bertrand Traoré et al were superb and will be missed.\n\nIt would’ve been nice for a Sunderland player to score, but now I’m being picky!\n\nColossus. When he got home, I think he would’ve found Nick Woltemade in his pocket.\n\nThe lad was immense — which is just as well as I thought Omar Alderete started quite slowly and looked a bit off it early doors, but he gave the Newcastle forwards zero chances and thwarted every attack that came his way.\n\nI think everyone will agree that he ran the show for us in the middle of the park.\n\nHe was a shield for our back four and was often a route to goal for us at the other end.\n\nHe just allows our other midfielders to take up pockets of space to either block attacks or fill spaces to create a route forward.\n\nThe lad didn’t score but he was a brute up top, and Dan Burn and Malick Thiaw struggled with his presence.\n\nSome of his hold up play was superb and if the referee was at all competent, he’d have booked Thiaw well before he finally did.\n\nAn awful display from that clown.\n\nThiaw committed five fouls before he finally got booked for dissent. The booking of Nordi Mukiele was a joke as both he and Burn led with their knees, but as Burn decided to stay down crying, he deemed the tackle too strong.\n\nFinally, he failed to book Fabian Schär for a clear deliberate trip on Brobbey — yet happily whipped a card out for Reinildo’s challenge on Anthony Gordon…where no contact was made!\n\nThe crowd did their part by “greeting” the Mags at the stadium and for their warm up.\n\nThe crowd was superb throughout and I hardly heard their fans chanting despite sitting in the North East corner. Everyone sang loud and proud for the Lads — and for Gary Rowell.\n\nHe put a shift in, acting as a battering ram and getting nothing off the referee all game.\n\nSolid as a rock and my man of the match.\n\nThe ref was my only downer on a glorious afternoon.\n\nHe gave us very little and nearly lost the game at the end. He seemed to have a vendetta against Brobbey and Sunderland in general, but he couldn’t spoil our day, our win, our pride and our joy.\n\nFor the unbelievers amongst us, pre-match nerves were based around the question of whether this group of players understood what this fixture meant.\n\nNeedless to say, there was no need to worry.\n\nNobody shirked a difficult challenge and the team’s desire to win second balls shone through. Yes, the game lacked quality but we definitely didn’t lack heart.\n\nI was slightly surprised to see Sky Sports award Dan Ballard with “Man of the Match”.\n\nHe was a colussus in the middle but for me, Nordi Mukiele deserves the most plaudits. I always assumed that the players’ shorts didn’t feature pockets but if you search deep down inside Nordi’s, you’ll find Anthony Gordon.\n\nHe didn’t get a sniff all game and finishing with a clean sheet and an assist just shows how brilliant his performance was.\n\nOne of the things that was worse than Michael Beale’s masterminding of the FA Cup tie was the aftermath — particularly the photo taken with Newcastle celebrating with their fans in our own stadium.\n\nHowever, I’d take that every day for the revenge we got yesterday.\n\nWhen you take part in stupid acts like that, people don’t forget, and the photo of this team celebrating with the South Stand is something that we’ll all remember.\n\nLike many others have said, the referee was baffling, letting several incidents slide which should’ve been pulled up — and Brian Brobbey had every right to feel aggrieved at what was a bizarre refereeing performance.\n\nDuring the early games, it felt like there was a well-received increase in quality from the officials when compared to what we endured in the Championship but with every passing week, the lines are blurring.\n\nThankfully, though, it had no impact on the performance and we walked away with all three points.\n\nAs the season has progressed, each home game has had the feel of “the biggest match of the season” for one reason or another, but this topped the lot.\n\nOur fans were magnificent throughout in a boiling atmosphere and there was the tribute for Gary Rowell right before kick-off.  It was a typical derby game — plenty of commitment all round and little goal action.\n\nFor overall endeavour and passage of play over the ninety minutes, we deserved to win it without offering a lot of goal threat, but neither did they.\n\nI saw a Middlesborough player put the winner away for us with ruthless efficiency back in February, but this one was even better.\n\nWoltemade was absolutely mercurial with his finish, launching his header in off the underside of the bar and thats exactly why Newcastle paid £65 million for him: to score spectacular goals like that and get the fans on their feet.  An unfortunate moment for him, but in a game that for all the effort shown featured few clear cut openings, all it would take was a mistake like that.\n\nFortunately, we were the benefactors and our run against Newcastle goes on. It’s almost like we haven’t been away!\n\nI try to look at referees objectively as I think they have a difficult job and the frustrations that I see regularly vented by supporters could be tinged with a liberal dose of bias, but dear Lord…this one?\n\nBrian Brobbey was flattened every time the ball was cleared up to him, but without any free kick coming our way.  Then on at least two occasions, when Sunderland were breaking from two positions, our players were fouled and although he did give the free kick our way, there was no yellow card for what were clearly bookable offences.\n\nIf any Newcastle players went down, he stopped the game — but not for anyone in a red and white shirt. He managed to keep it under control when tensions nearly boiled over towards the end, but overall I think he was pretty poor.\n\nThis one was for Gary Rowell. He would’ve loved it.",

    "description": "Sunderland draw in a six-goal thriller at Ayresome Park!",
    "fullText": "Following the shock of relegation from the top flight for the first time in our history in 1958, Alan Brown had a big job on his hands to rebuild the club.\n\nNot only did the club’s reputation require a rebrand after allegations of illegal payments made to players resulted in the highest-ever fine imposed on any football club by the FA up to that point, but fresh blood was needed on the team.\n\nIn the first two years in Division Two, Sunderland finished 15th and 16th in the table, which, although disappointing, allowed the likes of Len Ashurst, Cecil Irwin, Jim McNab, Nicky Sharkey and Martin Harvey to all come through the ranks to establish themselves.\n\n1960-61 proved to be more successful, with Brown’s side finishing a more respectable 6th in the table, one point and one place in the table behind Middlesbrough. Now, this wouldn’t usually be significant, but in the game at Ayresome Park that season, the sides were separated by a single goal, which was scored by a striker by the name of Brian Clough.\n\nBrown went straight out and did all he could that summer to bring Clough to Roker, which included meeting the striker as he went on a cruise with his wife to secure the £48,000 deal to bring him up the A19. In his first season – the same season where Jimmy Montgomery made his Sunderland debut – Clough set a post-war record of scoring 34 goals.\n\nBut promotion still eluded Sunderland and Clough as they finished a point behind Leyton Orient and nine points above champions Liverpool. There was a fresh optimism that 1962-63 would be the year that Sunderland returned to the First Division, and by mid-December Brown’s side were well placed in a promotion spot behind Chelsea, who topped the table.\n\nOn this day in 1962, Sunderland travelled to Clough’s old stomping ground, Middlesbrough, who were struggling in mid-table without his goals. What looked like on paper a potential routine victory for Sunderland turned into anything but, as the Hartlepool Northern Daily Mail described:\n\nRarely in their long histories can either Middlesbrough or Sunderland have fought so hard for a point as they did in Saturday’s “derby”. This was probably the best “derby” yet, and it was played at a tremendous pace from start to finish.\n\nI didn’t add the quotation marks in that quote by the way…\n\n43,232 crammed into Ayresome Park and after around twenty minutes Sunderland took the lead through George Mulhall, with what was described as a “brilliant solo run down the left” and shooting from an “impossible” angle that “skidded into the net” – but the controversy began a few moments later.\n\nFirstly, Ian Gibson stepped on McNab’s chest and soon after, the ball was knocked long up to Clough, who looked 5-6 yards offside. Clough’s reaction told the same story as he stood still with the ball as everyone waited for the whistle; this stillness ended with the striker almost casually toe-poking the ball over the goalkeeper and into the net. To everyone’s surprise, the goal was given.\n\nTwo minutes later, George Herd put Sunderland three up, and the game looked out of sight. But the situation with McNab’s injury looked serious as the series of events was described in the Journal:\n\nMcNab’s injury was the focal point of a fantastic “derby game as it has ever been my good fortune to see. He was first hurt in a clash with Gibson in the 17th minute, but after treatment, resumed in time to see Sunderland take the lead three minutes later.\n\nWhile he was being placed on the stretcher, this was increased to two and before he could be carried to the tunnel, Sunderland were three up, though McNab knew nothing about these goals until afterwards.\n\nA minute later, Boro took advantage and pulled one back through Billy Horner and five minutes before half-time it was back to 2-3 and two minutes later it was 3-3, and it remained so until the break. It all pointed to Boro taking control and maximum points in the second half, but Sunderland heroically held on to claim the point and celebrated as if they had won.\n\nSunderland: Montgomery, Nelson, Ashurst, Harvey, Hurley, McNab, Davison, Herd, Clough, Fogarty, Mulhall\n\nMiddlesbrough: Emmerson, McNeil, Jones, Yeoman, Nurse, Horner, Kaye, Gibson, Peacock, Orritt, Hume",

    "fullText": "Manchester United welcome Bournemouth to Old Trafford on Monday night. They are aiming to build on their impressive victory at Molineux and continue their ascent up the Premier League table.\n\nRuben Amorim’s side appear to have turned a corner recently. They have lost just one of their last nine Premier League games. Furthermore, they have collected more points in this period than in their previous 17 matches combined. The Red Devils arrive in high spirits after thrashing Wolves 4-1 last weekend. However, they face a Bournemouth side currently enduring a slump.\n\nThe Cherries are winless in their last six league matches. This is their longest such streak since early 2024. Despite their recent struggles, Andoni Iraola’s men have a formidable recent record at the Theatre of Dreams. They have won their last two away games against United by a 3-0 scoreline on both occasions.\n\nVenue: Old Trafford, Manchester\n\nLast Meeting: Manchester United 4-1 Bournemouth, 31 July 2025, Premier League Summer Series\n\nRuben Amorim confirmed that defenders Matthijs de Ligt and Harry Maguire remain sidelined with injuries. Furthermore, striker Benjamin Šeško is a major doubt due to food poisoning and will be assessed late. With defensive options limited, the manager may be forced to shuffle his backline. However, Amad Diallo, Noussair Mazraoui, and Bryan Mbeumo are expected to be available before departing for the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nAndoni Iraola faces a midfield selection headache. Lewis Cook serves the second game of his three-match suspension for a red card against Sunderland. Additionally, Ryan Christie and Ben Doak remain sidelined. Defensively, Marcos Senesi is a doubt after suffering cramps against Chelsea. However, the defender is optimistic about featuring. Young defender Veljko Milosavljevic is out for a couple of months with a knee injury.\n\nUnited’s recent resurgence has seen them climb the table. However, defensive fragility remains an issue. They have kept just one clean sheet in 15 Premier League games this season. Under Amorim, the team has recorded a clean sheet ratio of just 14.3%. Conversely, their attack is firing. Bruno Fernandes has been involved in eight goals in his last eight games.\n\nThe Cherries have hit a wall offensively. They have failed to score in their last two Premier League games. In fact, they managed just 18 shots in those goalless draws. Historically, this fixture has been tricky for United recently. They are winless in their last four meetings with Bournemouth. If Bournemouth win, they would become the first side ever to win three consecutive top-flight away games against Manchester United while scoring three or more goals each time.\n\nManchester United predicted XI: Lammens; Mazraoui, Heaven, Shaw; Diallo, Casemiro, Fernandes, Dalot; Mbeumo, Mount; Cunha\n\nBournemouth predicted XI: Petrović; Smith, Diakité, Senesi, Truffert; Adams, Scott; Brooks, Tavernier, Semenyo; Evanilson\n\nThe match will be broadcast live in the UK on Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports Premier League. Coverage starts at 18:30 GMT.\n\nRead- Premier League Team of the Weekend: Ekitike, Rogers, Wilson\n\nSee more- Sunderland boss celebrates ‘special’ derby win over Newcastle\n\nFacebook | Instagram | Twitter | YouTube",

    "description": "“Days like this are the sweetest reward of all for the turmoil we’ve had to endure over the past decade”.",
    "fullText": "A full-blooded performance to savour.\n\nAn atmosphere to revel in, and a result that’ll go a long way to showing that in the inter-city battle for North East supremacy between ourselves and Newcastle, Sunderland aren’t the plucky underdogs; the wide-eyed kid who finds himself playing with the big boys and is merely happy to participate rather than dwell on the outcome.\n\nLet this message be read and understood by all comers: we’re a serious football team.\n\nWe’re a serious football club, and as Nick Woltemade wrote his name into the history books with a looping header that sent the Stadium of Light into raptures (a deadly finish — just at the wrong end of the pitch from a black and white perspective) the energy that had crackled throughout this gritty Wear-Tyne derby finally erupted.\n\nThe lead was ours. We wouldn’t relinquish it and victory — greeted by the kind of roar that’s becoming commonplace at our home nowadays — was a moment that none of us will ever forget.\n\nWith Eddie Howe’s side appearing to be waylaid by stage fright, a lack of energy or simply a lack of belief in what they were attempting to do (What were they attempting to do? Answers on a postcard, please), this was a game decided by the kind of organic qualities to which the statisticians seem averse but Sunderland fans love to see.\n\nHeart, resilience, desire, work rate…you name it, and we displayed it in spades on Sunday.\n\nForget XG ratings and all of that mathematical guff — this was a derby as it used to be, won by the side who wanted it more, the side who displayed greater conviction in their play and who were willing to go the extra mile in pursuit of victory.\n\nRemember the inscription on the iconic Lambton Worm tifo — “The man who wins is the man who thinks he can”? Rarely — if ever — has there been a more fitting precursor to a Sunderland derby performance.\n\nSadness tinged this game as the spirit of the dearly departed Gary Rowell hung heavy in the crisp afternoon air, and I hope it won’t sound presumptuous to state that he would’ve doubtless loved what he saw from his beloved red and whites against their Saudi-backed neighbours.\n\nNews of his passing broke on Saturday evening; moving tributes were paid before kick off and there’s little doubt in my mind that the Lads channeled it into their performance — one filled with all of the traits we’ve come to expect from this side.\n\nCan Sunderland play better, more aesthetically pleasing and more entertaining football than we did on Sunday? Yes.\n\nWe’ve done so already this season, but derbies are often decided by key moments and when Woltemade — pocketed by the colossal Dan Ballard to add to his own goal strife — connected with Nordi Mukiele’s whipped cross, it proved the difference.\n\nFundamentally, exactly how you win in these kinds of affairs doesn’t matter.\n\nVictory or defeat is all that’s remembered, but to that memorable night in the St James’ Park deluge to Jermain Defoe’s winner in 2015, another milestone can be added and I don’t think any fair-minded supporter could rightly claim this was a fluke victory.\n\nAs we knew they’d need to do if we wanted to see off the visitors, all of our key men rose to the challenge here.\n\nGranit Xhaka led impressively. Enzo Le Fée grafted tirelessly, Brian Brobbey was a monster up front and Robin Roefs commanded his area with authority.\n\nThere were no backward steps taken and no sense of inferiority. The Lads knew that over ninety minutes, they could equal and maybe even best Newcastle, but believing it and executing when it matters are very different, yet this side boasts an elite mentality and an iron-clad self belief — something that’s grown during 2025.\n\nIn contrast, the visitors were utterly lacklustre and although the smokescreens of their European schedule and the supposed devalued nature of this clash (their words, not ours) may be used as mitigation, they simply didn’t turn up and that in itself was something of a shock.\n\nPost-match, Bruno’s now-predictable offerings about Newcastle “being a better team than Sunderland” felt somewhat inconsequential. They certainly weren’t on Sunday, and player for player, they haven’t been during 2025/2026 thus far.\n\nWhen Peter Bankes blew his whistle at full time, the post-match rendition of Wise Men Say — belted out proudly by the legions of Sunderland fans who didn’t want to leave a minute before they had to — seemed to carry even more weight.\n\nWe’re arguably more deeply in love with our football club than many of us have ever been, and days like this are the sweetest reward of all for the turmoil we’ve had to endure over the past decade. The ride continues, and I just don’t want it to stop.\n\nAs for Lord Gary of Rowell? We’ll miss him deeply and we’ll never forget him, but wherever he is now, he made the journey knowing that Sunderland AFC is a club reborn — on every single level.\n\nSunderland: 1 (Woltemade (og) 46’)\n\nSunderland: Roefs, Mukiele, Ballard; Alderete, Reinildo, Xhaka; Sadiki, Traoré (Hume 70’), Le Fée; Talbi (Mundle 83’), Brobbey (Isidor 70’)\n\nSubs Not Used: Patterson, Geertruida, Neil, Rigg, Adingra, Mayenda\n\nNewcastle United: Ramsdale, Livramento, Thiaw; Burn (Schär 42’), Hall, Guimarães; Tonali (Willock 59’), Miley, Elanga (J.Murphy 59’); Gordon (Barnes 59’), Woltemade (Wissa 75’)\n\nSubs Not Used: Ruddy, A.Murphy, Ramsey, Joelinton",

    "fullText": "Manchester United star Bryan Mbeumo must handle the twin challenges of scoring and captaincy when playing for Cameroon at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations in Morocco this month.\n\nWith veteran striker Vincent Aboubakar surprisingly axed, the responsibility for scoring falls heavily on the 26-year-old who moved to Old Trafford from Brentford last July.\n\nGoals have been hard to come by for the Indomitable Lions lately as they failed to find the net in two crucial 2026 World Cup qualifiers.\n\nNeeding maximum points at home against Angola two months ago to have any hope of automatic qualification, Cameroon managed only a 0-0 draw.\n\nGiven a second chance to qualify a month later as one of the best four African group runners-up, Cameroon fell 1-0 to the Democratic Republic of Congo in a play-off and were eliminated.\n\nFor Cameroon supporters, recalling the past exploits of star strikers like Roger Milla, Patrick Mboma and Samuel Eto'o, consecutive blanks were difficult to accept.\n\nMbeumo started in both matches, but poor service from midfield and tight marking meant scoring opportunities were scarce.\n\nAboubakar was the eight-goal leading scorer in the 2022 AFCON as hosts Cameroon finished third behind Senegal and Egypt.\n\nIt was an outstanding performance in the modern era of the premier African football tournament, finishing just one goal shy of matching the 1974 record of Congolese Ndaye Mulamba.\n\nBut Mbeumo was left without a potentially key partner in attack when new Cameroon coach David Pagou omitted Aboubakar from the Morocco-bound squad.\n\n\"We wanted to do things differently. They are good players, but we set our sights on others to create a different mindset,\" said Pagou, referring to Aboubakar and goalkeeper Andre Onana.\n\nWhile Mbeumo seeks goals in Group F against Gabon, title-holders Ivory Coast and Mozambique, he must also shoulder the additional responsibility of succeeding Aboubakar as captain.\n\nHe must lift a team whose morale is low after their failure to qualify for the World Cup in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nCameroon hold the African record for World Cup appearances with eight. Losing out to Group D winners Cape Verde, a west African archipelago with a population of just 525,000, was a bitter blow.\n\nMbeumo was born in eastern France to a Cameroonian father and a French mother, making him eligible to represent either country.\n\nHe played underage football for France before switching his international allegiance to Cameroon. His highlight so far with the Indomitable Lions was competing at the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.\n\nAt club level, he spent one season with Troyes in France, then six with Brentford, helping the London club gain promotion to the Premier League.\n\nHe formed a dynamic attacking partnership with Democratic Republic of Congo winger Yoane Wissa at the Bees -- both scored in the same match six times last season.\n\nIt was a feat matched only by Liverpool pair Mohamed Salah and Cody Gakpo in the 2024-25 Premier League.\n\nHis six goals this season for United include a brace in a 4-2 home victory over Brighton.",

    "fullText": "Striker Mohamed Amoura is set to be a key figure as Algeria seek redemption at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) in  Morocco after disastrous campaigns in the past two editions.\n\nThe Desert Foxes won the premier African football competition a second time in 2019, edging Senegal 1-0 in the final in Cairo.\n\nBut in two AFCON appearances since they failed to win a match in six attempts and twice made humbling first-round exits, leading to the sacking of coach Djamel Belmadi.\n\nHis place was taken by Vladimir Petkovic, who took Switzerland to two Euro Championship tournaments and one World Cup during a seven-year reign.\n\nThe 62-year-old born in Bosnia & Herzegovina rang the changes when he took charge of Algeria last year, including giving more opportunities to Amoura.\n\nHis faith in the 25-year-old, now with Bundesliga outfit Wolfsburg, has been richly rewarded with Amoura becoming the leading scorer in 2026 World Cup African qualifying with 10 goals.\n\nAmoura tormented a variety of rivals as Algeria secured a fifth appearance at the global showpiece, scoring a hat-trick against Mozambique and two each against Botswana, Somalia and Uganda.\n\nSince then he also found the net in an AFCON warm-up victory over Zimbabwe as Algeria prepare for Group E showdowns with Sudan, Burkina Faso and Equatorial Guinea.\n\nIt is a mini-league Algeria are expected to win, and Petkovic acknowledges that the Foxes are considered the strongest of the four contenders.\n\n\"The main objective is to get past the first round, (then) go as far as possible in the tournament,\" he said after announcing his squad.\n\nAmoura told the Algerian media he is optimistic Algeria will win Group E and qualify for the round of 16.\n\n\"It is a strong group. We respect every team, but fear no team. Algeria have a balanced squad that includes some outstanding players.\n\n\"Our goal is to go deep into the tournament and represent our country in the best possible way. We want to make our supporters happy and fight for the title.\n\n\"There is no secret to my scoring 10 goals in World Cup qualifiers. My achievements are due to hard work and the confidence given to me by my teammates and coaches.\n\n\"It is a huge honour to wear the Algerian jersey. I want to help my team as much as possible, whether it is scoring, creating goals or dropping back to defend.\"\n\nAmoura hailed Petkovic for creating an atmosphere during training camps that is conducive to success for a country that also won the AFCON in 1990.\n\n\"The atmosphere is excellent, It is serious, focused and there is a desire to give our best. It has to be that way because the 2025 AFCON is packed with strong teams.\"\n\nAmoura left Wolfsburg for Algeria at the weekend after scoring in a 3-1 league win at fellow bottom-half club Borussia Moenchengladbach.\n\nHe and Ivorian teenager Yan Diomande are the leading African scorers in the Bundesliga this season with six goals each.\n\nAmoura made his professional debut just five years ago with Entente Setif. He made an immediate impact leading to transfers to Lugano and Union Saint-Gilloise before joining Wolfsburg last year.\n\nHe initially left Union on loan, but the German club, releasing the potential of the Algerian, made the move permanent this year.",

    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah heads for Morocco this week to captain Egypt in the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) amid uncertainty over his future at Liverpool.\n\nSalah came off the bench midway through the first half and set up the second goal in a 2-0 Premier League win over Brighton at the weekend.\n\nAfter the match, manager Arne Slot said there was \"no issue to resolve\" with his star forward, but speculation continues to rumble over the Egyptian's future after his outburst last weekend.\n\nThe 33-year-old came on as a substitute and seized his chance by setting up Liverpool's second goal for Hugo Ekitike. Salah had been left out of Liverpool's squad for Tuesday's Champions League victory at Inter Milan after his explosive rant about Slot following the recent draw at Leeds. That was the third successive game that Salah had been left on the bench and his furious claim that he had been \"thrown under the bus\" hinted at a potential departure from the troubled Premier League champions during the January transfer window.\n\nThe Nigeria defender scored in his side's 3-2 win at Burnley. Bassey grabbed Fulham's second goal to put them 2-1 up in the 31st minute en route to their first victory at Turf Moor since 1951. The 25-year-old's close-range header from Harry Wilson's cross was his first goal since an FA Cup tie against Manchester United in March.\n\nIBRAHIM SANGARE (Nottingham Forest)\n\nThe Ivory Coast midfielder capped his side's 3-0 victory over Tottenham with the final goal. Sangare netted in the 79th minute at the City Ground, bending a superb strike in off the post with the outside of his foot. The 28-year-old's second goal this season -- and his first in seven matches -- helped boost Forest's bid to avoid relegation.\n\nAKOR ADAMS, CHIDERA EJUKE (Sevilla)\n\nNigerians Adams and Ejuke celebrated AFCON call-ups with a goal each as Sevilla hammered Real Oviedo 4-0 in La Liga. Adams opened the scoring in the fourth minute and Ejuke completed the rout with one minute of regular time remaining.\n\nAmoura scored for the second straight match in Wolfburg's 3-1 Bundesliga win at Borussia Moenchengladbach. With the teams level after 34 minutes, Amoura was on the spot to blast in a deflected Christian Eriksen cross, putting the visitors back in front. The 25-year-old has six goals and two assists for Wolfsburg in the league this season.\n\nRAMY BENSEBAINI (Borussia Dortmund)\n\nBorussia defender Bensebaini scored his side's only goal in a disappointing 1-1 draw at Freiburg. With Dortmund teammate and Guinea international Serhou Guirassy struggling in front of goal and missing chances, Bensebaini took matters into his own hands with 31 minutes gone. The Algerian latched onto a Yan Couto free-kick and blasted home from close range.\n\nHIMAD ABDELLI, HAROUNA DJIBIRIN (Angers)\n\nAlgerian Abdelli converted an early penalty and Cameroonian Djibirin restored a two-goal lead on 85 minutes as mid-table Angers trounced lowly Nantes 4-1 in Ligue 1. Both Africans were scoring their second goals of the league campaign.",

    "description": "What are the Packers' playoff chances after their loss to the Denver Broncos on Sunday? Latest odds, remaining schedule.",
    "fullText": "The NFL is called a week-to-week league for a reason.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers were reminded of that on Sunday.\n\nOne week they're living large having just overtaken the Chicago Bears for first in the NFC North, riding a four-game winning streak and climbing the playoff ladder. The next, they come crashing down with a stinging loss on many levels, falling to the Denver Broncos, while losing their spot in the division and falling to the seventh and final spot in the NFC playoff picture.\n\nThat's life in the crowded NFC when one loss can change your position very quickly.\n\nThe good news - though it might be hard for Packers fans to find it knowing the injuries the team suffered on Sunday - is that they can change their fortunes in six short days.\n\nThe Packers and Bears meet again and first place in the NFC North will again be at stake. A win will get them closer to punching their ticket to the playoffs.\n\nHere's the latest on the Packers' playoff odds, NFC North standings, playoff picture and remaining schedule:\n\nPackers-Bears Round 2 is up next.\n\nFor the second time in three weeks, the Packers (9-4-1) and Bears (10-4) will play with first place in the division on the line.\n\nThe Packers beat the Bears, 28-21, on Sunday, Dec. 7, in a thriller at Lambeau Field. Now, Green Bay heads to Chicago in the rematch.\n\nKickoff is set for 7:20 p.m. on Saturday, Dec. 20, at Soldier Field.\n\nWhile their long-term prospects took a major hit with the latest round of injuries, the Packers are still in good shape to make the playoffs even after the loss.\n\nAccording to the New York Times' playoff simulator, the Packers have a 92% chance of making the playoffs following the games on Sunday.\n\nIf the Packers beat the Bears next week, their playoff odds will be greater than 99%. A loss drops their odds to 85% and fans will likely begin getting a little more nervous.\n\nEntering the game against the Broncos, there was a chance for the Packers to be the No. 1 seed after Week 15 if they won and the Los Angeles Rams lost. Well, both of those outcomes didn't happen so earning that top spot looks to be gone. They have less than a 1% chance to get the No. 1 seed, which comes with a first-round bye.\n\nThe Rams' win over the Detroit Lions did put greater separation between the Packers and their NFC North rival. The Lions (8-6) are two games back of the Packers in the loss column with three games to play. Two more wins for the Packers guarantees the Packers with a better record than Detroit. Green Bay beat the Lions twice this season.\n\nThe Lions' chances to make the playoffs is just 27% after Week 15.\n\nHere are the standings after Sunday's games. The Los Angeles Rams remained the No. 1 seed by winning a shootout over the Detroit Lions, while the Bears switched spots with the Packers after their win over the Cleveland Browns and Green Bay's loss later in the day.\n\nLos Angeles Rams: 11-3 (NFC West leader)\n\nChicago Bears: 10-4 (NFC North leader)\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles: 9-5 (NFC East leader)\n\nTampa Bay Buccaneers: 7-7 (NFC South leader)\n\nSeattle Seahawks: 11-3 (first wild card team)\n\nSan Francisco 49ers: 10-4 (second wild card team)\n\nGreen Bay Packers: 9-4-1 (third wild card team)\n\nIn the hunt: Detroit Lions (8-6), Carolina Panthers (7-7), Dallas Cowboys (6-7-1)\n\nEliminated: Minnesota Vikings (6-8), Atlanta Falcons (5-9), New Orleans Saints (4-10), Washington Commanders (4-10), Arizona Cardinals (3-11), New York Giants (2-12)\n\nThe Packers' loss dropped them from first to second in the division standings, while the Bears moved back to the top. The division lead will be back on the line when the two teams square off on Saturday for the second time in three weeks.\n\nChicago Bears: 10-4, defeated the Cleveland Browns, 31-3\n\nGreen Bay Packers: 9-4-1, lost to the Denver Broncos, 34-26\n\nDetroit Lions: 8-6, lost to the Los Angeles Rams, 41-34\n\nMinnesota Vikings: 6-8, defeated the Dallas Cowboys, 34-26\n\nThe Packers have just three games left on their schedule. Their next two games will be played on Saturday night.\n\nHere's the Packers' remaining schedule:\n\nat Chicago Bears, 7:20 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 20\n\nvs. Baltimore Ravens, 7 p.m. Saturday, Dec. 27\n\nat Minnesota Vikings, TBD, Sunday, Jan. 4\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Packers playoff chances: Next game, NFC standings, remaining schedule",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nChariton Arnold Ferrin Jr. was a basketball star in college while at the University of Utah. In 1944, he was named the Most Outstanding Player of the NCAA Tournament as the Utes won the national championship, and three years later, he helped the school win a National Invitation Tournament title.\n\nThe Lakers took Ferrin in the third round of the 1948 draft, and he spent three seasons in the NBA, with all of them coming as a member of the Lakers. He averaged 5.8 points and 1.6 assists a game during that time and won championships during both of his first two seasons in the league.\n\nAfter his NBA career ended, Ferrin had a short stint as the general manager of the American Basketball Association's Utah Stars in the 1970s, and afterward, he was the athletic director for the Utes from 1976 to 1985. During his time as athletic director, the Utes won a total of 10 national championships, including four NCAA titles in women's gymnastics.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 18 — Chariton Arnold Ferrin Jr.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea boss Enzo Maresca is unlikely to get any \"protection\" after making cryptic comments seemingly aimed at the club's ownership, says former Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney.\n\nThe Italian described the build-up to Saturday's Premier League victory over Everton as \"the worst 48 hours\" since he arrived at the club in June 2024.\n\nIn an extraordinary outburst, the 45-year-old suggested that he and his team had not been supported before refusing to clarify who his comments were directed at.\n\n\"For me it was very similar to the Mo Salah situation last week where it was very premeditated,\" said the ex England striker on the latest episode of The Wayne Rooney Show, which you can now listen to on BBC Sounds.\n\n\"He knows exactly what he is saying and who he is aiming it at and the board and owners at Chelsea will know it is aimed at them.\"\n\nChelsea currently sit fourth in the English top flight but had only taken two points from the previous nine available prior to the weekend with a loss at Atalanta in the Champions League also thrown into that run.\n\nAnd unlike the very public backing that Ruben Amorim received from Manchester United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe earlier this season, Rooney believes that Maresca's words will have done himself few favours if the club endure any further blips.\n\n\"You've got to respect the owners of a football club. They employ you and bring you in, so it's their way and I feel he's gone a bit against that,\" Rooney added.\n\n\"It is something that's clearly happened, whether it's a disagreement or he feels his job is under pressure and he doesn't feel it should be because of the two trophies he's won and the points he's picked up.\n\n\"I don't feel like he's a manager that will backtrack. He has got a passion about him and a drive about him. Whether he has heard things, like the club might want him out and he's been proactive to go on the front foot, you don't know why he's done it. It's very strange.\n\n\"I don't think he'll get the protection now he's come out and done what he has done. That will be very difficult for the club to come and protect him, which is a shame.\"\n\nWatch the Wayne Rooney Show on BBC Sport YouTube, and iPlayer.

    "description": "The Kansas City Royals made a trade with the Milwaukee Brewers.",
    "fullText": "The Kansas City Royals made a trade with the Milwaukee Brewers to bring in outfielder Isaac Collins in exchange for Angel Zerpa. Collins posted a 118 OPS+ last season and is a great defensive outfielder. While Zerpa has value as a left-handed relief pitcher, Collins fits Kansas City's lineup well, which general manager J.J. Picollo acknowledged.\n\n\"At this point, we felt like this was a very good move for us considering our needs,\" he said (via Anne Rogers of MLB.com). “The need for on-base, the need for an outfielder. Adding a switch-hitter to our roster, and then Isaac’s positional versatility is very attractive when you combine that with the number of years of control.\"\n\nPicollo added, “We know right now that the outfield is the primary spot he’s going to play, but it never hurts to have a player that has been in other positions and done well in other positions. We feel like there’s a lot of upside to this and some safety at the same time. It helps you manage your roster well.”\n\nRoyals reportedly acquire OF Isaac Collins and RHP Nick Mears from the Milwaukee Brewers for LHP Angel Zerpa, per multiple reports including MLB's @Feinsand. pic.twitter.com/xrPq4uj8Gr\n\nCollins was drafted in the ninth round of the 2019 MLB Draft by the Colorado Rockies out of Creighton University. He debuted on Sept. 8, 2024, recording one hit and one stolen base in two at-bats. Across two MLB seasons, he has appeared in 141 games with 389 at-bats, 100 hits, nine home runs, 56 runs scored, 54 RBIs and 17 stolen bases. His career slash line is .257/.361/.398 with a .760 OPS and 113 OPS+.\n\nIn 2025, Collins played 130 games, tallying 98 hits, nine home runs, 56 runs, 54 RBIs and 16 steals. His 2025 slash line was .263/.368/.411 with a .779 OPS and 118 OPS+. This type of production, when paired with plus defense, is a great get for the Royals.\n\nAs for Zerpa, his Royals run ends after five seasons in KC. While with KC he logged 177.0 innings with a career ERA of 4.13. In 2025, Zerpa pitched 64.2 innings with a 3.86 ERA and 1.37 WHIP.\n\nOn Collins, Picollo added, “He does it in a different way. He gets deep in counts. He’s not afraid with two strikes. The contact rates are good. But I think the on-base is what separates him from what we don’t have right now or what we haven’t had a lot of success with. We need guys who can get on base around our top four or five guys.”",

    "fullText": "Chelsea are apparently leading the race to sign a Premier League player according to an exclusive report over the weekend.\n\nHowever, said player may well have his eyes elsewhere, which then makes me wonder, how can Chelsea be leading the race to sign him if he wants to go elsewhere?\n\nEither way, Chelsea are certainly one of the many clubs who have been looking at signing Kobbie Mainoo from Manchester United.\n\nThe midfielder looks set to leave the his club very soon, and you wouldn’t bet against a move happening in the January transfer window due to the fact that Mainoo is just not being picked for United right now and will be in search of further minutes to go off and play for the rest of this season.\n\nI actually think for that reason that this would pretty much rule Chelsea out, because Mainoo isn’t going to be a starter in our midfield right now, is he?\n\nKobbie Mainoo warms up for Manchester United. (Photo by Gareth Copley/Getty Images)\n\nAlthough at least 12 clubs are reportedly in the race, sources close to the situation have informed CaughtOffside that Chelsea and Bayern Munich are “leading the chase”. However, the player’s personal preference list still places Napoli as the frontrunner. Mainoo is prioritising where he can be a guaranteed starter as he plots his next move.\n\nThe end of this report is probably all you need to read about it. If Mainoo wants to go somewhere he can be a regular starter, then he isn’t going to chose Chelsea is he?\n\nUnless Chelsea got some big injuries to Enzo Fernandez and/or Moises Caicedo, then Mainoo is never starting ahead of them two. Then you have the likes of Andrey Santos who is even not getting much game time himself, waiting in the wings. Cole Palmer is back and will be playing in midfield too. There’s just no chance of regular game time there for Mainoo.",

    "fullText": "England have overlooked spinner Shoaib Bashir for the crucial third Ashes Test against Australia in Adelaide.\n\nThe tourists, who need to win to keep alive hopes of regaining the urn, have made one change from the team beaten in the second Test in Brisbane.\n\nAs expected, Josh Tongue replaces fellow pace bowler Gus Atkinson.\n\nIt is the omission of 22-year-old Bashir that is most striking for a Test where spin is likely to play an important role.\n\nEngland have instead retained all-rounder Will Jacks after he played his first Test in three years in Brisbane.\n\nIt is a huge decision by England captain Ben Stokes and head coach Brendon McCullum for a Test where jobs and reputations could be on the line.\n\nIt calls into question the entire experiment involving Bashir, whom England have asked to learn on the job in Test cricket over the past two years.\n\nBashir's absence from the first two Tests in Australia has been explained by the conditions.\n\nAustralia off-spinner Nathan Lyon bowled only two overs in the first Test and then was left out of the second.\n\nBut Lyon will return on Wednesday (23:30 GMT Tuesday) on a ground where no other bowler has taken more than his 63 Test wickets, with legendary Australia leg-spinner Shane Warne just behind on 56.\n\nThe importance of spin will likely be accentuated by the extreme temperatures forecast in Adelaide - as high as 39C for Thursday's second day.\n\nEngland have previously backed Bashir as their frontline spinner, despite him not being the first-choice slow bowler for his county Somerset. Bashir's deal at Taunton expired at the end of the season and he is yet to sign a new one.\n\nStokes and McCullum felt Bashir had the attributes to succeed in Australia, mainly a high release point and the ability to extract bounce from the surface.\n\nHis performances in an England shirt since making his debut in India at the beginning of 2024 have been a qualified success. Bashir's 68 wickets in 19 Tests have come at an average of 39, and in May he became the youngest England bowler to reach 50 wickets.\n\nBut Bashir has not played for England since breaking his finger in the third Test against India in July. His best moment in an England shirt was also his most recent act - taking the wicket to win that thrilling Test at Lord's.\n\nBefore the Brisbane Test, when off-spinning all-rounder Jacks was selected ahead of Bashir, Stokes still backed Bashir as the tourists' frontline spinner.\n\nEngland XI for third Ashes Test v Australia: Zak Crawley, Ben Duckett, Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Harry Brook, Ben Stokes (captain), Jamie Smith, Will Jacks, Brydon Carse, Jofra Archer, Josh Tongue.\n\nNo batting changes for vital Ashes Test - McCullum\n\nFour decisions for England before third Ashes Test\n\nBut he has struggled in Australia, returning figures of 2-266 in two tour matches. Bashir has also looked short of rhythm in the nets.\n\nEngland did not select another specialist spinner in their squad - the likes of Rehan Ahmed, Liam Dawson and Jack Leach were overlooked.\n\nIt means England will rely on Jacks, primarily a batter and with six first-class wickets this year.\n\nIn contrast, Australia can call on Lyon, the 38-year-old who sits seventh on the all-time list of Test wicket-takers with 562. Lyon needs two in Adelaide to leapfrog great Australia seamer Glenn McGrath in sixth.\n\nSpeaking before England confirmed their XI, Lyon said: \"I would be surprised if their number one spinner is not playing. Will Jacks, I thought he played a pretty decent role in Brisbane with the opportunity he had.\n\n\"I'm not really concerned what XI England produce. We'll worry about what we're doing, and control what we can control.\"\n\nHead coach McCullum previously admitted England were unlikely to make changes to their batting line-up, so Tongue is the only new face from the side beaten in Brisbane.\n\nIn the pace department, both teams are likely to rotate in the final three Tests, which are played back-to-back.\n\nAustralia will have the luxury of Pat Cummins returning in Adelaide after the captain missed the first two Tests with a back injury.\n\nEngland's Atkinson struggled in the first two Tests. His three wickets have come at a cost of 78 runs each and two of them were taken when the second Test was as good as over.\n\nTongue, 28, has taken 31 wickets in six Tests, including dismissing Australia's Steve Smith in both innings when he played his only previous Ashes match at Lord's in 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, England batter Harry Brook has recognised his own shortcomings in the series so far.\n\nBrook made 52 in the first innings of the first Test in Perth, but has not passed 31 in his three other knocks. He said the shots he played to be dismissed in the second innings in Perth and first innings in Brisbane were \"shocking\".\n\n\"Sometimes I've got to rein it in a little bit,\" said Brook. \"To learn when to absorb the pressure a little bit more and realise when the opportunity arises to put the pressure back on.\n\n\"I feel like I haven't done that as well as I usually do. There's no reason behind that, I just haven't identified those situations well enough.\"\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Milwaukee second baseman has shown marked improvement at plate in his three MLB seasons. Hitting .300 might not be that much out of range for Turang.",
    "fullText": "In his three MLB seasons, Milwaukee Brewers second baseman Brice Turang has seen his batting average improve 40 points each season. He's continued to show marked improvement at the plate, which might lead some Brewers fans to consider this point.\n\nCould Turang hit .300 in the 2026 MLB season? Yes, he could.\n\nLook at Turang's power numbers. In 2023, Turang hit six home runs in 404 at-bats; in 2025, he hit seven home runs in 559 at-bats; and last season, Turang hit 18 home runs in 584 at-bats. As four doubles, Turang has gone from nine to 24 to 28 over his first three seasons.\n\nThis obviously shows that Turang is getting better and better each season.\n\nBrewers manager Pat Murphy might be smiling like a proud papa when he looks out at second base and sees Turang turning double plays with ease. \"He's a ballplayer,\" Murphy has said about Turang. \"You can see it. You can smell it. The best is yet to come for him. He's got so much to give.\"\n\nWhat's next for the Brewers' team MVP from 2025? He's going to play for Team USA in the World Baseball Classic next year. Turang has played for Team USA in teenage baseball series and remembers those times quite vividly.\n\n\"That was some of the best times that I’ve ever had playing baseball,\" Turang said, according to an MLB.com article. \"I was looking forward to seeing who the team was [for the 2026 tournament], and when I find out it’s me, I was like, 'Oh, man, I’m excited.'\"\n\nFor the Brewers, they want to make sure that they stay atop the National League Central Division again in 2026. They'd also like a return trip to the National League Championship Series and, potentially, knock off the Los Angeles Dodgers en route to their own World Series championship.\n\nTurang is quickly ensuring that he's a fan favorite, not only for his play on the field but how he handles himself as an MLB player.\n\nThe Brewers aren't going to bring a bunch of knuckleheads into the organization. Brewers president of baseball operations Matt Arnold is very selective on who he wants to bring on the team. And, yes, you better believe Murphy has a thing or two to say when new players are being considered for the ballclub.\n\nHe's worked hard to make sure the Brewers' clubhouse is strong and full of teammates that will stick up for one another.\n\nWatch for Turang to have a great 2026 and, hopefully, have a pleasant World Baseball Classic experience and avoid getting injured.\n\nRemember to join our BREWERS on ROUNDTABLE community, which is FREE! You can post your own thoughts, in text or video form, and you can engage with our Roundtable staff, as well as other Brewers fans. If prompted to download the Roundtable APP, that's free too.",

    "description": "Seattle has found their backup backstop, potentially.",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Mariners are reportedly finalizing another small addition, signing C Andrew Knizner to a major league deal per Daniel Kramer of MLB.com. The veteran backstop will be 31 for the 2026 season, and seems likely to receive a league minimum-adjacent two-way deal that would allow Seattle to option him despite having exceeded his initial allotment of minor league options across the last seven seasons with the St. Louis Cardinals, Texas Rangers, and San Francisco Giants.\n\nKnizner (pronounced KIZ-ner, silent first ‘n’ and the z is before the second n) has a .211/.281/.316 line with a 68 wRC+ for his career, and an uninspiring -1.7 fWAR in 326 games and 975 plate appearances. Other estimations are kinder, with Baseball Reference’s bWAR seeing him as a 1.0 WAR player in his career, and WARP from Baseball Prospectus granting him a forgettable -0.1. What none of these estimations, nor Baseball Savant, seem to find impressive is Knizner’s defense relative to his peers, making the light-hitting righty a peculiarity in terms of his niche.\n\nKnizner hasn’t always been destined for a bench role. The 2016 7th rounder for the Redbirds was a steady hand at NC State University who moved behind the dish as a sophomore after initially playing 3B on campus. His strong offensive numbers up through the St. Louis system had him near the top of the Cardinals’ prospect list in 2019, as well as an inclusion in the FanGraphs top-100 list at 82nd, two spots behind Will Smith of the Dodgers and two spots ahead of Jarred Kelenic, newly of the Mariners. The acclaim followed representing St. Louis in the 2018 All-Star Futures Game, and Knizner was slated to be the eventual heir to Yadier Molina at Busch Stadium at his 2019 big league debut. While the expectation could not have been that Knizner would match Yadi long-term, the youngster struggled immediately, and served in an up-and-down backup backstop role for the next few years.\n\nHis keys to the starting job came in 2023, as Willson Contreras shifted out from behind the dish briefly, but Knizner’s best year at the plate could not overcome a surprisingly stagnant capacity for framing, blocking, and curtailing base stealers. He’s bounced up and down with a couple organizations since, and while his framing seems to have improved since leaving Yadi’s shadow, it is honestly surprising the M’s are pursuing Knizner for a big league deal, even at a presumably minute cost. Watching Knizner swing, you can see the Mitch Garver resemblance, and his ability to hit the ball hard was at one point above-average, though it’s not been present whatsoever in the past couple campaigns.\n\nThere have been teams willing to sign and play Knizner for the past seven years, and at one point he was a rather promising prospect. It could be Seattle sees something in him they think might be improved into a southpaw-swatting threat as they’ve long prized in a backup C, with Garver, Tom Murphy, and Luis Torrens in recent years. Without wanting to be too much more critical than this blurb has been/felt, Knizner has not yet been that player as a big leaguer. He’ll need to find that gear to emulate Murphy and Torrens more than Seby Zavala in his tenure.",

    "fullText": "It's inevitable that Liverpool will need to make additions to their midfield pack in the near future.\n\nAgainst Brighton on Saturday, the starting XI featured Florian Wirtz, Dominik Szoboszlai, Alexis Mac Allister, Ryan Gravenberch and Curtis Jones, with just Wataru Endo missing out with an injury. The slight caveat here is that Arne Slot chose against playing any out-and-out wingers in the front line.\n\nNonetheless, if this is the system that is going to help bring more consistency to the team's performances, then we might need to invest in signing greater depth to help make it happen.\n\nWhat's frustrating to hear, however, is that Liverpool are no longer in the running for one of the best talents available on the market, with other Premier League teams heavily interested in making a move.\n\nLiverpool's sporting director was praised heavily over the summer for the club's remarkable recruitment effort, and he's since come under fire for the team's poor form, with the new signings failing to hit the ground running. There is a multitude of different opinions on the transfer guru.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nRight now, however, it appears as though he might be making a big mistake when it comes to the speculation around young AZ Alkmaar midfield prospect Kees Smit, who could leave in January.\n\nThe I Paper is reporting that Chelsea are currently frontrunners in the race for him, with Newcastle, Tottenham and Manchester United all following behind. Right now, a £25m valuation has been placed on the 19-year-old star and it's expected that offers in that region could force the club to sell him.\n\nWhat's problematic here, is that Liverpool are not mentioned as one of the interested parties, when previous reports from CaughtOffside have extensively reported a different story. Since this is the most recent update we have on the Dutchman, it only feels right to take this information as gospel.\n\nThe report also notes that Smit's international manager Ronald Koeman said that he's a similar player to Pedri at Barcelona - comparing him to the former Kopa Trophy winner is an enormous compliment.\n\nAnd yet, it's probably the most apt way to describe him as a player, because his heat map for the season is all over the pitch, spreading far and wide. He's deep as a No. 6 at times, central in a more No. 8 style, and even getting goals and assists as a false No. 10. He has five goal contributions.\n\nWhat's perhaps most impressive about Smit is that he's played 2000 minutes for Alkmaar across this campaign so far, and we're only half-way into December. Having that level of fitness at his age, and delivering to such a standard that Maarten Martens doesn't feel he can drop him, is truly remarkable.\n\nFor around £30m, it's a no-brainer of a transfer move for Liverpool, especially when you consider how vast the Dutch contingent on Merseyside is. Cody Gakpo, Virgil Van Dijk, Jeremie Frimpong and Gravenberch, alongside Slot and his coaching staff, could all keep him company.\n\nAnd while it's already been said, it's worth reiterating how essential it is for the Reds to have midfield depth. Against Brighton, Slot used all but Endo in his starting XI. There was no one else on the bench.",

    "fullText": "Gian Piero Gasperini has been clear with the club: he wants at least one offensive reinforcement in January.\n\nThe target is a striker and the renowned right-footed left-back, but the manager would be happy with a versatile player like Fabio Silva, who could be back in fashion after summer interest.\n\nJoshua Zirkzee remains at the top of Frederic Massara’s list. He’s a No. 9 with the class of a trequartista who can play all attacking roles and who knows the Italian league well.\n\nNegotiations with Manchester United, however, are far from straightforward, which is why Roma is studying alternatives.\n\nAfter Celtic vs. Roma, Frederic Massara didn’t fly to the capital, but headed to England.\n\nRepresentatives of the 2001-born player awaited him there.\n\nThe Red Devils’ demands are clear: €30-35 million, immediately.\n\nHowever, as reported in Corriere dello Sport, the Giallorossi sporting director is ready to negotiate: he will free up space to offer the English club a costly loan, perhaps even exceeding €7 million.\n\nThe only certainty, however, is that Zirkzee himself will need to push for the transfer. The striker, however, is needed immediately; Gasperini needs him, and the tight league standings are a dream.\n\nSo Fabio Silva’s name is back in the news. The Giallorossi are reportedly ready to offer the German club the same deal they had for Zirkzee: a costly loan with an option or obligation.\n\nThe Portuguese has failed to establish himself in Germany and has collected one goal and three assists in just 364 minutes.\n\nThe 2002-born player had been waiting a long time for the Giallorossi in the summer, and continues to keep an eye on them: after a few months this push and pull could end with a happy ending.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea’s win over Everton at the weekend was pretty routine. What followed in the press conference was not.\n\nManager Enzo Maresca, in the middle of a routine answer about Malo Gusto’s form, suddenly started speaking in a passionate way about how this had been his “worst 48 hours” since joining Chelsea.\n\nNobody really knew what he meant, and his follow up answers remained cryptic. But it was clear he was upset by something, and we’ve been waiting to find out what.\n\nYesterday the well connected insider Ben Jacobs came through with an update, although it still doesn’t get too specific about what’s wrong.\n\nEnzo Maresca has a tense moment in his press conference.\n\n“Enzo Maresca has an internal issue at Chelsea which prompted his post-match comments about not feeling supported, talkSPORT understands,” Jacobs wrote.\n\n“talkSPORT understands his frustration has been brewing for some time despite qualifying for the Champions League in his first season in charge and claiming both the Europa League and Club World Cup.”\n\nSo it does indeed sound like this anger is directed at his bosses at Chelsea rather than at the fans or the media. That’s a pretty explosive move to make from the coach, and we still don’t know in what way he wants to be supported more. He’s clearly feeling comfortable in the manager’s chair if he’s making\n\nWe will find out more later today at the manager’s press conference ahead of our EFL Cup game against Cardiff tomorrow, although we can expect a very smoothed off, well rehearsed answer by then.\n\nTrevoh Chalobah was one of the stars of the show on Saturday and his stats highlight another excellent performance alongside Wesley Fofana in Chelsea’s back line.\n\nCole Palmer opened the scoring with a lovely run and finish after being picked out by Gusto. The game had been pretty pedestrian until that point.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s January transfer strategy is beginning to take shape, and it points firmly towards control rather than chaos. As first reported by Metro, Ruben Amorim is actively trying to block Kobbie Mainoo from leaving Old Trafford, despite growing interest from Serie A champions Napoli and the player’s own frustration at a lack of minutes.\n\nUnited are not expected to be overly active during the winter window after spending more than £200m last summer. Amorim added Bryan Mbeumo, Matheus Cunha, Benjamin Sesko and goalkeeper Senne Lammens, reshaping the attacking unit while leaving some established names in limbo. With midfield reinforcements unlikely in January, protecting squad depth has become a priority.\n\nThis is where Mainoo’s situation becomes emblematic of United’s wider balancing act between short term results and long term asset management.\n\nKobbie Mainoo’s fall from prominence has been stark. Once viewed as one of United’s brightest prospects, his role has diminished sharply under Amorim. As Metro note, “England’s Euro 2024 star has started just one game this season – United’s Carabao Cup defeat to League Two side Grimsby Town.”\n\nMainoo himself was keen to leave on loan last summer and is now reportedly desperate for a January exit to revive his career and keep his World Cup ambitions alive. Napoli, under Antonio Conte, see opportunity. Yet Amorim remains reluctant, aware that AFCON absences could suddenly elevate Mainoo’s importance.\n\nUnited’s restraint is driven as much by circumstance as strategy. Top midfield targets Carlos Baleba, Adam Wharton and Elliot Anderson are unlikely to move mid season. As a result, United “will likely keep their powder dry until the summer transfer window.”\n\nThat caution explains Amorim’s resistance to departures. Losing Mainoo without a replacement would weaken flexibility during a congested second half of the campaign. United could climb to fifth with a win over Bournemouth, and European qualification remains firmly in sight.\n\nMainoo is not the only name drawing interest. Joshua Zirkzee, signed for £36.5m, has just one goal in nine appearances this season and is attracting attention from Roma and AC Milan. Ayden Heaven, Diego Leon and Sekou Kone are also considering loan moves.\n\nNapoli sporting director Giovanni Manna struck a measured tone on Mainoo, saying, “He’s a player who’s been linked to Napoli since August, partly because of his age, prospects, and opportunities.” For now, Amorim appears determined that those opportunities remain in Manchester.\n\nFrom a Manchester United supporter’s perspective, this report feels both reassuring and unsettling. Reassuring because Amorim is finally projecting authority, refusing to let promising players drift away in January panic deals. Blocking a Mainoo exit signals that the manager still sees value, even if his team selections suggest otherwise.\n\nAt the same time, it raises uncomfortable questions about squad management. If Mainoo is important enough to keep, why has he been marginalised to this extent. Fans remember the player who dominated midfield moments and started a Euro 2024 final. Watching him reduced to cameo appearances feels like a waste of both talent and momentum.\n\nThere is also scepticism around the wider transfer logic. United accepting that no midfielder will arrive in January makes retaining Mainoo sensible, but it also highlights lingering recruitment inefficiencies. Supporters want clarity, not just control.\n\nAmorim’s stance may pay off during AFCON when depth matters. Yet if Mainoo continues to sit unused, frustration will only grow. For fans, this feels like a holding pattern, necessary perhaps, but hardly inspiring. The second half of the season must bring either trust or transition, because standing still rarely works at Old Trafford.",

    "fullText": "The New York Jets barely showed up on Sunday in a disgraceful display of football ineptitude. The Jacksonville Jaguars moved the ball at will against a no show Jets defense. The game turned into a rout early. It was over by halftime, with the second half functioning as extended garbage time. The Jaguars were so dominant they pulled their starters early in the fourth quarter as they cruised to a 48 – 20 blowout victory over a lifeless and seemingly disinterested Jets team. With the Jets eliminated from playoff contention, a large and growing list of injured players, and many of the remaining players looking like they have checked out for the season, these last three games are likely to be rough sledding.\n\nNext week the Jets go on the road to face a 4-10 New Orleans Saints team that has shown some life of late, winning three of their last five games, including a season sweep of the Carolina Panthers. The Saints are not a good football team, but they seem to be improving, and they certainly have not matched the Jets’ level of ineptitude lately.\n\nLet’s take a look at the current odds for this game according to FanDuel Sportsbook. The current line has the Jets road underdogs by 4.5 points. The game has an over/under of 40.5 points. On the moneyline the Jets are +176 and the Jaguars are -210. It is a mark of the depths to which the Jets have fallen that they are substantial underdogs to a Saints team that has scored more than 19 points just three times all year.",

    "description": "Mason Mount is delivering for Manchester United - but can his performances force him into Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad?",
    "fullText": "\"I have to tell you, I love that kid.\"\n\nRuben Amorim's first public observations on Mason Mount after his appointment as Manchester United head coach just over a year ago have stood the test of time.\n\nIt has taken longer than hoped for United's fanbase to come to the same conclusion, but Mount's goal and overall performance at Wolves last week had them purring.\n\nSuddenly, the hole left by the impending departure of Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo to the Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon) doesn't look quite so difficult to fill.\n\nMount's game intelligence plus his awareness and ability to play in tight spaces are coming to the fore. Now the phrase most used about him is: \"His quality was never in doubt.\"\n\nAlmost two and a half years into the five-year contract he signed in July 2023, Mount's own bold declarations about the future have some meaning.\n\n\"I am hugely ambitious,\" he said on his arrival at Old Trafford. \"I know how amazing it feels to win major trophies and what it takes to do it.\n\n\"I will be giving everything to experience that again at Manchester United.\"\n\nIt is fair to say the statement of intent Mount made after completing his £55m move from Chelsea is yet to be fulfilled.\n\nMatch-winner Mount's quality 'never in doubt'\n\nAmorim hails Mount after win at Wolves\n\nA Champions League and Club World Cup winner with Chelsea, Mount was an injury-time substitute for United's 2024 FA Cup final victory over Manchester City. He started the Europa League final defeat by Tottenham in May and was part of the United squad that finished 15th.\n\nNot that the 26-year-old regrets leaving boyhood club Chelsea.\n\nSpeak privately to people who know Mount well and you get the impression restoring United's fortunes offered the kind of challenge that enthused him.\n\nUnder Erik ten Hag at the time, the club made it clear they wanted him. That matters. It still does. That is why Amorim's first words were perfectly put.\n\nAs the former Sporting coach assessed the squad he was inheriting, he knew in Mount he was getting a high-level, flexible player who could fit into a variety of different positions within his system, something Amorim felt he did not have enough of.\n\nLeft, right, as an orthodox number 10, as a six, or an eight, Mount has a range of experiences that make him very useful for a coach who regards adaptability as a key weapon.\n\n\"He's a very smart player,\" was Amorim's response when asked about Mount on Friday before Monday's Premier League game with Bournemouth. \"He's really technical.\n\n\"Sometimes being a technical player is not just having fun with the ball. It's the quality of the pass, the reception, how to receive the ball. Mason can balance our team quite well.\"\n\nAmorim is not alone at United's Carrington training ground in recognising Mount's qualities. He is certainly not the only one genuinely glad a player who can offer so much is able to put injury issues to one side and deliver performances on a consistent basis.\n\nNo-one would argue the past couple of years have been easy. Mount himself has admitted dealing with two extended absences and a couple of smaller frustrating ones was tough.\n\nBut staff around Carrington admired the professional attitude Mount adopted throughout his various recoveries.\n\nTraining-ground sources have said the player left no stone unturned in pursuit of staying fit and was regularly one of the last to leave after long stints in the ice bath and sauna sessions.\n\nHe is regarded as a link within Amorim's squad - someone who knits groups of players together - which has been particularly evident this season when, it is generally acknowledged, United's players have remained tight and focused on delivering better results.\n\nMount is also well liked by non-football staff because he is helpful, which is not something that can be taken for granted in the playing department at United or any other club. He spends time with a couple of kids who are regulars outside the training ground, has spoken with them and their parents and still wears a bracelet one of them gave him.\n\nThese traits are all positives on a human scale.\n\nHowever, in the pressurised world of the Premier League, they are side issues compared to delivering on the pitch - and just now, he is on a roll.\n\nOutstanding in the win at Crystal Palace on 30 November, Mount followed up with an excellent performance against Wolves, who were admittedly poor at Molineux but proved they can be obdurate and diligent in their unlucky loss at Arsenal.\n\nGoals in both victories have taken his overall tally for United to seven, to match his shirt number, a fact not lost on the club's content creators who put them all on the app and launched a vote for which was the best. His second in the Europa League semi-final against Athletic Bilbao - a two-touch, 50-yard effort to seal a 4-1 win - came out on top.\n\nThe idea over the next few weeks and months is to widen that particular area of debate as United push for a European place - their overall aim - and try to secure a top-five berth likely to deliver a return to the Champions League a year before schedule.\n\nMount won the most recent of his 36 England caps in the 2022 World Cup quarter-final defeat by France in Qatar.\n\nDespite three years without an international appearance, Three Lions boss Thomas Tuchel has not forgotten him.\n\nMount revealed in the summer his former manager at Chelsea had been in touch. The pair were spotted chatting after last month's home defeat by Everton and while competition for World Cup places is fierce and Mount is rated as unlikely to break in at this stage, it cannot entirely be discounted.\n\nThe player himself is not setting that as a target. Sources say his focus and drive remains on delivering on those first words following his arrival from Chelsea.\n\nMount recognises turning the United tanker around has to be a collective effort but there are signs it is heading in the right direction, even if the process is lengthy and not without the odd glitch.\n\nHe clearly has a significant role though. Mount has missed one game so far this season though injury. His impact is starting to be felt.\n\nJust as United prepare to lose two significant attacking forces to Afcon, they can look for Mount to deliver in their absence with an increased feeling of confidence.\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The Responses API represents a powerful evolution in how we interact with large language models. Unlike traditional chat completion APIs that return simple text responses, the Responses API enables structured, multi-step workflows that can orchestrate multiple tools and produce rich, multi-modal outputs.\n\nIn this article, we'll explore how to build an AI-powered application that combines web search and image generation capabilities.\n\nSource Code: The complete example is available on GitHub.\n\nDocumentation: For comprehensive Responses API documentation, see the Responses API guide and Image Generation guide.\n\nThe Responses API is a more powerful alternative to the traditional Completions API. It enables structured, multi-step workflows with support for multiple built-in tools like web search and image generation, producing rich, multi-modal outputs that can be easily processed programmatically.\n\nBefore we dive into the code, let's ensure we have everything we need.\n\nOur example requires the following Rust crates:\n\nHere's the complete Cargo.toml for our example:\n\nYou'll need to set your API key as an environment variable:\n\nNote: Make sure to keep your API key secure. Never commit it to version control or expose it in client-side code.\n\nNow let's construct our Responses API request. We'll create a request that uses both web search and image generation tools.\n\nModel Selection - We're using \"gpt-4.1\", which supports the Responses API and tool calling. Make sure to use a model that supports these features.\n\nInput Parameter - We use InputParam::Text to provide a simple text prompt. The model will:\n\nTool Configuration - We specify two tools:\n\nThe ..Default::default() ensures all other fields use their default values, which is a common Rust pattern for struct initialization.\n\nNext, we need to set up the Vllora LLM client with our credentials.\n\nThe client uses a builder pattern for configuration. Here we:\n\nTip: In production, consider using a more robust error handling approach instead of .expect(), such as returning a Result or using a configuration management library.\n\nNow let's send our request and see what we get back.\n\nThe client.responses().create() method:\n\nThe Response struct contains an output field, which is a vector of OutputItem variants. Each item represents a different type of output from the API:\n\nLet's see how to extract and display text content from the response.\n\nMessage Structure - Each Message contains a content vector that can hold different content types:\n\nAnnotations - Text outputs can include annotations which provide:\n\nThese annotations are particularly valuable when using web search tools, as they show where the information came from.\n\nThis is the core focus of our example - extracting and saving generated images.\n\nWhen the model uses the image generation tool, the response includes OutputItem::ImageGenerationCall variants. Each call contains:\n\nHere's our complete image handling function:\n\nExtract Base64 Data - We access the result field, which is an Option<String>. We use .ok_or() to convert None into an error if the result is missing.\n\nDecode Base64 - The base64 crate's STANDARD engine decodes the base64 string into raw bytes. This can fail if the string is malformed, so we use ? to propagate errors.\n\nSave to File - We use Rust's standard library fs::write() to save the decoded bytes to a file. We name it generated_image_{index}.png to avoid conflicts when multiple images are generated.\n\nReturn Filename - We return the filename so the caller knows where the image was saved.\n\nHere's how we integrate this into our response processing:\n\nWe match on OutputItem::ImageGenerationCall, extract the call, and pass it to our decoding function. We handle both success and error cases gracefully.\n\nLet's put it all together and see the complete flow:\n\nWhen you run this example, you'll see output like:\n\nThe actual news content and image will vary based on what's happening when you run it!\n\nThis example demonstrates how to use the Responses API to create multi-tool workflows that combine web search and image generation. The key steps are:\n\nThe Responses API enables powerful, structured workflows that go beyond simple text completions, making it ideal for building applications that need to orchestrate multiple AI capabilities.",

    "fullText": "The Republic of Rose Island (Esperanto: Respubliko de la Insulo de la Rozoj; Italian: Repubblica dell'Isola delle Rose, both lit. 'Republic of the Island of the Roses') was a short-lived micronation on a man-made platform in the Adriatic Sea, 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) off the coast of the region of Emilia-Romagna, Italy, built by Italian engineer Giorgio Rosa, who made himself its president and declared it an independent state on 1 May 1968.[1][2]\n\nAlthough Rose Island had its own government, currency, post office, and commercial establishments, and the official language was Esperanto,[1] it was never formally recognized as a sovereign state by any country of the world. The Italian government viewed it as a ploy by Rosa to raise money from tourists while avoiding national taxation. Rose Island was occupied by Italian police forces on 26 June 1968, subjected to a naval blockade, and eventually demolished in February 1969.[3][4]\n\nIt is believed that the Esperanto term Rozoj (in Italian: rose) was borrowed from the surname of Giorgio Rosa, the designer and builder of the artificial platform, as well as the creator and inspirer of the state entity, as well as from his desire to \"see roses bloom on the sea\".[5]\n\nIn 1958, Italian engineer Giorgio Rosa funded the construction of a 400-square-metre (4,300 sq ft) platform supported by nine pylons and furnished it with a number of commercial establishments, including a restaurant, bar, nightclub, souvenir shop, and post office, with construction being completed in 1967.[6]\n\nThe platform declared independence on 1 May 1968, under the Esperanto name Insulo de la Rozoj, with Rosa as self-declared president. Rose Island issued a number of stamps, including one showing its approximate location in the Adriatic Sea. The purported currency of the republic was the mill, and this appeared on early stamp issues, although no coins or banknotes are known to have been produced.[7]\n\nRosa's actions were viewed by the Italian government as a ploy to raise money from tourists while avoiding national taxation. Whether or not this was the real reason behind Rosa's micronation, the Italian government's response was swift: On 26 June 1968, 55 days after the island declared independence, the Italian navy sent a group of four carabinieri and Guardia di Finanza officers, who assumed control, cleared the island, and set up a blockade so no one could re-enter.[7][8]\n\nAt first, the Italian government tried to dismantle the island, but they found it impossible, so they decided to blow it up instead. The Italian Navy bombed the island twice, with the first time failing, and the second bombing taking place on 13 February 1969,[9] but the island still stood. Afterward, Rosa's self-declared government in exile created stamps depicting the events. Rosa was billed by the Italian government for war costs. Finally, on 26 February 1969, the island was toppled by a storm. Only one death was counted but never confirmed: apparently, Rosa's dog was on the platform during the facility's detonation.[8]\n\nRosa died in 2017, having given his blessing for a film to be made about Rose Island. This was released in 2020.[10]\n\nSince the first decade of the 2000s, Rose Island's history has been the subject of documentary research and rediscoveries, based on the utopian aspect of its genesis.[11]",

    "fullText": "You know what's wild? Right now, as you're reading this, there are approximately 20,000 different types of proteins working inside your body. Not 20,000 total proteins, 20,000 TYPES. The actual number of protein molecules? Billions. Trillions if we're counting across all your cells.\n\nEach one has a specific job. Each one has a specific shape. And if even ONE type folds wrong, one could get Alzheimer's, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, Parkinson's, Huntington's, mad cow disease, or any of thousands of other diseases collectively called \"protein misfolding diseases.\"\n\nYour body makes these proteins perfectly, billions of times a day, in every single one of your 37 trillion cells, without asking your opinion, without requiring a user manual, without ever attending a protein folding workshop.\n\nScientists spent 50 years, FIFTY YEARS, trying to figure out how to PREDICT what shape a protein would fold into based on its amino acid sequence. Entire careers were built on this problem. Nobel Prizes were awarded for incremental progress. Supercomputers were dedicated to simulating single protein folds that took weeks to complete.\n\nThen AI companies showed up in 2020 and said \"we got this\" and solved it in an afternoon.\n\nAnd now? Now we're not just predicting shapes, we're DESIGNING entirely new proteins that have never existed in nature. Proteins that can break down plastic. Proteins that can capture carbon dioxide. Proteins that can target cancer cells with sniper precision. We're playing God with molecules and it's working.\n\nBut before I tell you how NVIDIA went from making GPUs that render explosions in Call of Duty to designing molecules that might cure cancer, you need to understand what proteins actually are and why this problem was so stupidly, impossibly, hilariously hard that it became one of biology's grand challenges alongside \"how does consciousness work\" and \"what is dark matter.\"\n\nLet's start from scratch. Forget everything you learned in high school biology. We're doing this right.\n\nRemember from my previous articles: your DNA gets transcribed into RNA, which gets translated into proteins. That's the central dogma. DNA → RNA → Protein. Information flows one way. (Mostly. Retroviruses are weird. Don't worry about it.)\n\nBut what IS a protein? And I mean really, fundamentally, at the molecular level?\n\nA protein is a chain of amino acids that folds into a specific 3D shape, and that shape determines what the protein does.\n\nThat's it. That's the entire definition. A chain. That folds. Into a shape. That does stuff.\n\nBut as with literally everything in biology, the devil is in the details. And the details are where things get interesting (and by interesting, I mean \"ridiculously complicated but in a cool way\")\n\nThere are 20 standard amino acids that your body uses to build proteins. (There are actually a few more non-standard ones, but let's not complicate things yet.) Think of them as letters in an alphabet. But instead of making words and sentences, they make functional machines.\n\nEach amino acid has the same basic structure:\n\nLet Me Introduce You to Some Amino Acids (They Have Personalities)\n\nThe point is: these 20 amino acids can be arranged in ANY order and in ANY length to create proteins. And your body picks the exact right order to make each protein work.\n\nA typical protein has 200-400 amino acids. Some have thousands. Titin, the largest known protein in humans, has 34,350 amino acids. It's literally a molecular spring that provides elasticity to muscle tissue.\n\nLet's do some math that will hurt your brain:\n\nFor a protein that's just 100 amino acids long, there are 20^100 possible sequences. That's 1.27 × 10^130 possible combinations.\n\nAnd most of those sequences? They don't fold into anything useful. They're junk. They aggregate into clumps. They get degraded by cellular quality control. Only a TINY fraction of possible sequences fold into stable, functional proteins.\n\nNature had to search this impossibly vast space and find the sequences that actually work. And it did this through random mutation and natural selection over 3.5 billion years. Evolution is the ultimate brute-force search algorithm.\n\nBut we don't have 3.5 billion years. We want to design proteins NOW.\n\nWhen a ribosome finishes making a protein (remember translation from my last article?), it spits out a long, floppy, completely linear chain of amino acids. This chain is called a polypeptide, literally \"many peptides\" because each amino acid is connected to the next by a peptide bond.\n\nThe peptide bond forms between the carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of the next:\n\nThis creates a backbone (the repeating NH-CHR-CO pattern) with side chains (R groups) sticking out.\n\nAnd then, immediately, while the ribosome is still finishing the rest of the chain, something magical happens:\n\nThe chain starts folding itself.\n\nNo chaperone proteins initially (those come later if needed). No instructions. No assembly manual. No quality control inspector. The amino acids just start interacting with each other based on their chemical properties, and the whole thing spontaneously collapses into a compact, functional 3D structure.\n\nThis is called spontaneous folding or self-assembly, and it's one of the most beautiful phenomena in molecular biology.\n\nProtein folding is driven by thermodynamics, specifically, the search for the lowest free energy state (most stable configuration). Multiple forces contribute:\n\n1. The Hydrophobic Effect (The Big One)\n\nThis is the primary driving force for most proteins. Hydrophobic amino acids (like leucine, valine, phenylalanine) are energetically unfavorable in water. Water molecules have to organize around them in structured \"cages,\" which decreases entropy (disorder).\n\nThe system wants to maximize entropy. So what happens? Hydrophobic amino acids cluster together in the protein's core, away from water. This releases the ordered water molecules back into the bulk solution, increasing overall entropy.\n\nMeanwhile, hydrophilic amino acids (charged and polar ones) stay on the surface, happily interacting with water.\n\nThis creates a protein structure with:\n\nLike a molecular M&M. Except instead of chocolate, it's biochemistry.\n\n2. Hydrogen Bonds (The Backbone of Structure)\n\nIndividually, hydrogen bonds are weak (about 5% the strength of a covalent bond). But proteins have HUNDREDS of them. Collectively, they're incredibly strong.\n\nThese are called secondary structures, local patterns in the protein backbone.\n\n3. Electrostatic Interactions (Salt Bridges)\n\nOppositely charged amino acids attract each other:\n\nThese are called salt bridges or ion pairs. They're strong and help stabilize the folded structure.\n\n4. Disulfide Bonds (The Chemical Staples)\n\nWhen two cysteine residues come close together, their sulfur atoms can form a disulfide bond (S-S). This is a COVALENT bond, much stronger than the other interactions.\n\nDisulfide bonds are like staples that hold parts of the protein together. They're especially common in:\n\nInside cells (reducing environment), disulfide bonds are rare.\n\n5. Van der Waals Forces (The Weak but Numerous)\n\nWhen atoms get very close, they experience weak attractive forces called van der Waals interactions. They're tiny individually, but proteins have THOUSANDS of atoms in close contact, so collectively they matter.\n\n6. Entropy (The Desire for Disorder)\n\nFolding DECREASES entropy (the protein goes from a floppy, disordered chain to a compact, ordered structure). This is thermodynamically unfavorable.\nBut remember: folding releases water molecules from around hydrophobic residues, which INCREASES entropy. The net effect? Folding is favorable overall.\n\nSmall proteins (50-100 amino acids) can fold in microseconds to milliseconds.\nLarger proteins take seconds.\n\nYour cells are making proteins and folding them CONSTANTLY. Every second. Right now. While you read this.\n\nAnd here's the crazy part: the folded structure is reproducible. Given the same sequence, you get the same structure. Every time. It's deterministic (mostly, there are exceptions called intrinsically disordered proteins, but let's not go there).\n\nThis means the folding information is ENCODED in the amino acid sequence. The sequence contains all the instructions needed to fold into the correct shape. But humans don't know how to READ those instructions directly. We can see the sequence. We can see the final structure. But predicting one from the other? That took 50 years to figure out.\n\nThe final 3D shape is called the protein's native structure. It has several levels of organization:\n\nPrimary structure: The linear sequence of amino acids. Just the order.\n\nSecondary structure: Local patterns (alpha helices and beta sheets).\n\nTertiary structure: The full 3D arrangement of the entire protein chain.\n\nQuaternary structure: If multiple protein chains come together (like hemoglobin, which has 4 chains), how they're arranged relative to each other.\n\nThe native structure is the functional form. This is the shape that DOES the biology.\n\nAnd this is where things get critical.\n\nHere's the most important concept in all of protein biology, and I cannot stress this enough:\n\nA protein's function is ENTIRELY determined by its 3D shape.\n\nNot the amino acid sequence. Not the chemical properties of individual residues. The three-dimensional structure.\n\nChange the shape even slightly, and the protein stops working. Change it drastically, and you get disease.\n\nLet me give you examples that show just how insanely specific this is.\n\nEnzymes are proteins that speed up chemical reactions. Without them, most biological reactions would happen so slowly that you'd be dead. Your cells would be frozen in chemical slow-motion.\nEnzymes have a specific pocket called an active site, a precisely shaped cavity where the chemical reaction happens. The substrate (the molecule the enzyme works on) fits into this pocket like a key in a lock. The fit is SPECIFIC. If the shape is even slightly wrong, the substrate won't fit. The reaction won't happen. The enzyme is useless.\n\nLactase (The Enzyme That Digests Milk Sugar)\n\nLactase is the enzyme that breaks down lactose (milk sugar). If you're lactose intolerant, it's because your body either stopped making lactase or makes a misfolded version that doesn't work. Result? Lactose sits in your intestines. Gut bacteria ferment it. You get gas, bloating, diarrhea. One misfolded protein = digestive chaos. You can't drink milk because your protein has the wrong shape. That's how specific this is.\n\nYour immune system has to recognize millions of different threats: viruses, bacteria, toxins, parasites. It does this with antibodies, Y-shaped proteins that bind to specific invaders.\nEach antibody is custom-shaped to recognize a specific molecular pattern (called an antigen) on the surface of an invader. The tips of the Y are shaped to fit that specific target.\nThe fit is so precise that an antibody designed for the flu virus won't recognize the common cold virus. Different shapes = different antibodies needed.\n\nThis is why vaccines work. You expose your immune system to a harmless version of a pathogen, your body makes antibodies with the right shape to recognize it, and now you're protected.\nIf the antibody shape is wrong, your immune system won't recognize the threat. You get sick.\n\nModern medicine exploits this by designing custom antibodies as drugs:\n\nThese are literally designer proteins with custom shapes targeting specific molecules. Billion-dollar drugs that work because the shape is right.\n\nHaemoglobin carries oxygen in your blood. It's shaped like a four-leaf clover with pockets that hold iron atoms, which bind oxygen. The shape is critical for function. Haemoglobin picks up oxygen in your lungs (where O₂ is abundant) and releases it in your tissues (where O₂ is scarce).\nBut if you change just ONE amino acid...\nSickle Cell Anemia is caused by a single mutation:\n\nPosition 6 in the beta chain of haemoglobin\nGlutamic acid (charged, hydrophilic) → Valine (hydrophobic)\n\nThat's it. One letter out of 146 amino acids in that chain.\n\nBut valine is hydrophobic. It creates a sticky patch on the surface of the haemoglobin molecule. When haemoglobin releases oxygen, this patch is exposed. Hydrophobic patches love to stick together. So sickle haemoglobin molecules clump together, forming long fibers. These fibers deform red blood cells into sickle (crescent) shapes.\nSickled cells:\n\nOne amino acid. One shape change. Lifelong disease.\n\nHere's where it gets truly terrifying. Prions are misfolded proteins that can convert normal proteins into the misfolded form, spreading like an infection. They cause diseases like:\n\nThe protein involved is called PrP (prion protein). Everyone has it. It's a normal protein on the surface of neurons. But PrP can misfold into a different shape, same amino acid sequence, different structure. This misfolded version (PrP^Sc) is:\n\nIt's autocatalytic. Self-replicating. And it destroys brain tissue.\n\nThere's no cure. It's 100% fatal. And it's all because of protein shape.\n\nIn 1969, a scientist named Cyrus Levinthal did some math and realized something disturbing:\nProtein folding shouldn't work.\n\nConsider a protein with 100 amino acids.\nEach amino acid has bonds that can rotate, and each bond has maybe 3 stable angles.\nSo there are roughly 10^95 possible shapes the protein could adopt.\nNow, let's say the protein can try one shape every picosecond (10^-12 seconds). That's incredibly fast, molecular vibrations happen on that timescale.\nHow long would it take to try all possible shapes to find the correct one?\n10^83 seconds.\nThe universe is about 10^17 seconds old.\n10^83 seconds is 10^66 times longer than the age of the universe.\nIf proteins had to randomly search for the correct fold, it would take longer than the universe has existed.\nBut proteins fold in milliseconds.\nThis is the Levinthal Paradox. Folding should be impossible. But it happens. Every time.\n\nThe Answer: Proteins Don't Search Randomly\n\nProteins follow a folding pathway, they don't try every possible shape. They take shortcuts.\n\nImagine a landscape with hills and valleys. The native structure is the deepest valley (lowest energy state). If the protein randomly wandered around, it would take forever to find the valley.\n\nBut the landscape is shaped like a funnel:\n\nIt's guided by the energy landscape encoded in the amino acid sequence. Evolution figured out sequences that fold efficiently.\n\nNature is smarter than random searching. Who knew.\n\nSo, proteins fold into specific shapes based on their sequences. Great.\n\nHere's what scientists wanted to do:\n\nGive me an amino acid sequence (like: MKTAYIAKQRQISFVKSHF...) and I'll tell you what 3D shape it will fold into.\n\nSimple request. Insanely hard problem.\n\nThis is called the protein folding problem, and it's been one of the grand challenges of biology since the 1960s.\n\nIf you can predict protein structure from sequence, you can:\n\nBut we couldn't do it. We tried for 50 years. And mostly failed.\n\n1. The Search Space is Incomprehensibly Vast\n\nWe already covered this. 10^95 possible conformations for a 100-amino-acid protein. Even with folding pathways, the space is enormous.\n\n2. The Interactions Are Complicated\n\nEvery amino acid interacts with every other amino acid. For a 100-amino-acid protein, that's nearly 5,000 possible pairwise interactions. And they all influence each other simultaneously.\nIt's like trying to solve a Rubik's cube where every move affects every other square in unpredictable ways.\n\nProteins fold in water. Water molecules interact with the protein, forming hydrogen bonds, pushing hydrophobic parts inward, stabilizing charged regions.\nYou can't model the protein in isolation. You need to simulate thousands of water molecules too. And water is WEIRD, its properties (hydrogen bonding, high dielectric constant) make it computationally expensive to model.\n\n4. Small Changes Have Big Effects\n\nChange one amino acid and the whole structure can change. It's not a linear relationship. The folding landscape is rugged, small mutations can shift the entire energy funnel.\n\nProtein folding is governed by thermodynamics. You need to calculate the free energy of every possible conformation and find the global minimum (most stable state).\n\nThis requires simulating quantum mechanical interactions between thousands of atoms. Computationally, it's a nightmare.\n\nX-ray Crystallography (1950s onward):\n\nGrow protein crystals → Blast them with X-rays → X-rays diffract off the atoms → Analyze the diffraction pattern → Reconstruct the 3D structure\n\nNMR Spectroscopy (1980s onward):\n\nPut protein in a magnetic field → Use radio waves to probe the positions of atoms → Reconstruct the structure from the data\n\nCryo-Electron Microscopy (2010s):\n\nFlash-freeze proteins → Image them with an electron microscope → Average thousands of images to get high resolution\n\nThis revolutionized structural biology (2017 Nobel Prize) but:\n\nNone of these methods PREDICT structures. They DETERMINE structures experimentally.\n\nScientists tried to simulate folding computationally.\n\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) Simulations:\nModel every atom in the protein and surrounding water → Calculate forces between atoms using physics equations → Simulate the motion of atoms over time (Newton's laws) → Watch the protein fold\n\nAnd even then, you might miss the correct fold or get trapped in a metastable state (local energy minimum that's not the global minimum).\n\nA software developed by David Baker's lab that uses:\n\nRosetta was better than nothing. It could sometimes predict structures for small proteins or proteins similar to known structures.\n\nIn 1994, researchers created CASP, Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction.\nEvery two years, teams compete to predict protein structures. Organizers choose proteins whose structures are about to be solved experimentally, teams submit predictions, and then the real structures are revealed.\n\nScores range from 0 to 100. Above 90 is considered competitive with experimental accuracy.\nFor 25 years, the best scores hovered around 40-60 for difficult targets. Progress was incremental. Slow. Frustrating.\n\nIn CASP13 (2018), a team from DeepMind (Google's AI lab) entered a protein structure prediction method called AlphaFold. It used deep learning, neural networks trained on known protein structures. AlphaFold 1 achieved a median GDT score of 58.9, placing first overall. The biology community took notice. This was the first time a machine learning approach significantly outperformed traditional methods. But it wasn't revolutionary. It was good, not great. There were still errors. Difficult targets were still difficult. Researchers thought: \"Okay, AI is promising, but we're not there yet.\"\n\nIn November 2020, CASP14 results were announced.\n\nDeepMind's AlphaFold 2 achieved a median GDT score of 92.4.\n\nLet me put this in perspective:\n\nAlphaFold 2 essentially SOLVED the protein folding problem.\n\nFor 87% of targets, it achieved GDT > 90. For some targets, it was MORE accurate than the experimental structures (because X-ray crystallography has its own errors).\n\nDeepMind open-sourced the code and released the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database, predicted structures for 200 million proteins (essentially every known protein sequence).\n\nProteins are like language. A protein sequence is a string of letters (amino acids). Those letters follow rules (chemistry). The structure is the \"meaning\" of the sequence.\nAnd modern AI is REALLY good at understanding language patterns. That's what powers large language models. AlphaFold adapted the same technology, transformers with attention mechanisms, for proteins.\n\nAlphaFold doesn't simulate physics. It recognizes patterns learned from 170,000+ known protein structures.\nAnd it works. Ridiculously well.\n\nBut AlphaFold Wasn't Perfect. AlphaFold 2 was groundbreaking, but gaps remained:\n\nNVIDIA makes GPUs, your Graphics Processing Units. They were originally designed for rendering video game graphics. But GPUs are incredibly good at parallel processing, doing thousands of calculations simultaneously.\nAnd guess what needs massive parallel processing?\n\nNVIDIA realized: the same hardware that powers gaming can power drug discovery.\nSo they didn't just optimize AlphaFold to run faster on GPUs, they built an entire ecosystem for biological research:\n\nAnd they partnered with pharmaceutical giants, Pfizer, Amgen, AstraZeneca, who are using these tools to design drugs RIGHT NOW.\n\nBasically: how gaming GPUs became the most important tool in modern drug discovery. And why this matters even if you've never thought about proteins before.\n\nPart 2 coming soon. This is where things get truly wild.\n\nDisclaimer: Everything in this article is scientifically accurate. Proteins really fold in milliseconds. AlphaFold really solved a 50-year-old problem. Your gaming GPU really uses the same architecture as drug discovery platforms. Biology is weird, AI is powerful, and we're living in the future.",

Yesterday Matthews was livestreaming from a lounge at Heathrow Airport when another man and his wife walked in; that man happened to be Ringo Starr, and Matthews did not recognize him.\n\nStarr was wearing a mask, but flashed his face just briefly enough for viewers to recognize him. After asking Matthews whether or not he was \"on the radio,\" Starr approached him. Matthews asked Starr where he was from, to which he replied, \"I'm from Liverpool,\" in what might be the most Beatles-sounding accent you can imagine. When Matthews said he'd just come from Manchester, Starr responded, \"We must be brothers.\" Starr's wife, Barbara Bach, noticed Matthews had been coughing and sniffling and asked him if he was sick. After Matthews said he was indeed feeling a little under the weather, Starr and his team left the room.\n\nOnce he was alone again, Matthews confessed to the livestream chat — who kept trying to tell him the man was \"Beatle Ringo\" — that he didn't know who the man was. \"His wife looked pretty classy, so he must be pretty high-value,\" Matthews said. \"Beatle Ringo? Who is that? Who the fuck is Beatle Ringo?... Is he on one of them statues from Liverpool?\"\n\nMatthews gave himself a brief crash-course in Beatles history, which was a good call on his part, because he wound up sitting right by Starr on his flight. They took a selfie together, which Matthews proudly shared on Instagram.

    "title": "From trees to graphs: speeding up vector search 10x with Hannoy",
    "description": "This is a walkthrough of a new LMDB-based HNSW Rust vector store with drastically better performances than the previous random-projection-based one. This is a disk-based HNSW highly vector store inspired by the DiskANN technology and is now used by default in Meilisearch.",
    "fullText": "This article aims to address several limitations of the current vector database used by Meilisearch, and to introduce hannoy: a graph-based alternative to arroy using LMDB, which is already part of Meilisearch since v1.21 (Sept 15) as experimental and the default one since v1.29 (Dec 8).\n\nEarly testing has shown that the new system can reduce indexing times from 2 days to 2 hours, decrease the on-disk index size by a factor of 2, and speed up search by ~10 times. When it was first put into production on an instance with indexing difficulties, it reduced the indexing latency from 2 months to... 6 seconds.\n\nTo illustrate why this is the case, I'll run through some key heuristics of graph ANN algorithms and share a few snippets from the code that are particularly illustrative. Finally, we'll share some benchmarks comparing the new solution to what's currently in Meilisearch today.\n\nI am not a Meilisearch employee or affiliated with the company in any way other than being a co-author on their new vector database.\n\nI first became aware of Meilisearch back in March, when my company began considering their enterprise solution for hosting and indexing our collection of ~10 million documents. As any sane person would do, I stalked their GitHub and was overwhelmed by the sheer volume of in-house crates they maintained and used in their search engine. Amongst them was arroy: a k-d trees inspired vector database, based initially on Spotify's similarly named project: annoy.\n\nWasting no time, I made my first open source contribution ever to the repo and... welp, it's still not merged 😔. But hey, as the French say: that's life.\n\nFortunately, I was still able to merge a few other PR's in the meantime and learn more about how the algorithm worked. The back and forth I had with other devs throughout the process (notably with @irevoire) was instructive and overall made it a pretty enjoyable experience.\n\nAfter a couple of months of working on arroy, I naturally became aware of a few unsavoury trade-offs that lurked beneath the surface, and which ultimately motivated me to pursue a new approach.\n\nArroy is a k-d tree-based ANN algorithm, meaning that during indexing, you construct an ensemble of random partitions of your vector space, and at runtime, you search through them all simultaneously. To be more precise, it's random-projection-based.\n\nVisually, that process looks like the pic below:\n\nA widespread criticism of this type of approach is that search performance and latency degrade when the dimension of the embeddings exceeds about 20. Let's try to understand why.\n\nLooking at the code, we see that leaf nodes store as many vectors as the embedding dimension. This is a good and bad thing. In the extreme case where \"one leaf equals one vector\", e.g., you have a binary tree, each tree has height log2(n). By grouping d-many vectors in a leaf, trees can be built much faster since they only have height log2(n/d). For 1 million vectors of dimension 768, the numbers work out to building trees with heights of 10 versus 20; that's a 2.6 MiB versus 1.9 GiB in storage overhead for a single tree. This makes arroy B-tree-like, which is cool.\n\nWhere this is problematic, however, is at search time since you need to compare the query to each vector in a leaf. Even if you're only trying to retrieve the 10 nearest-neighbours, you still need to do 768 distance calculations 😔. That adds significant latency during retrieval.\n\nUnfortunately, there's no \"nice\" compromise; if you make leaves more granular, you need to store more nodes in the tree, which increases the index size in memory and exponentially increases build times, as we've seen.\n\nWhen using binary vectors and a bit-sampling hash, the memory overhead is just a single usize per node indicating the position of the random bit. This is the only case where we can afford to generate deeper trees, as storing a node on disk incurs next to no cost.\n\nAnother big problem with arroy is that the indexing algorithm is extremely read-heavy. That makes sense given that to create a hyperplane, you need to randomly sample points from the current node to generate clusters. The impact of this is so high that in some builds, over 90% of the time is spent doing IO and in page faults - a problem that only grows exponentially with dataset size. This phenomenon is still unresolved, as documented in arroy#145.\n\nOperational concerns aside, it's also just difficult to maintain arroy. There's a lot of mental gymnastics involved in understanding the recursive tree balancing algorithms, the creation and merging of temp files during partial builds, and the heuristics for auto-selecting build parameters. But hey, maybe that's a skill issue on my part.\n\nCurrent state-of-the-art ANN libraries employ graph-based approaches to achieve the optimal trade-off between search time and recall performance. Here, a navigable graph is built over all points in the database, and search is performed using a best-first traversal in log time. So rather than imposing structure on the dataset via separating hyperplanes like in arroy, techniques like HNSW and DiskANN focus more on building up pathways between points in local neighbourhoods.\n\nIf you haven't already read it, I'd recommend Pinecone's fantastic blog post on Faiss and the hnsw to get a working mental model of how these algorithms work. For the academically inclined, the original paper is also quite insightful.\n\nFor the search to converge quickly to the (approximate) nearest neighbour, the graph needs to satisfy what's known as the sparse neighbourhood graph (SNG) property. Put simply, points in a local neighbourhood of x should be closer to x than they are to each other. For the mathematically inclined, this property reduces to the relations below :\n\nThis equation is the \"secret sauce,\" if you will, of graph ANNs. Both the HNSW, DiskANN, and hannoy! rely on this to ensure efficient search.\n\nVector search over a graph has several advantages over space-partitioning approaches. First of all, it's extremely cheap to store node edges on disk at around ~200 bytes per vector even without using compressed bitmaps (which we do). For another, disk reads and distance computations at search time are significantly reduced as neighbours are explored one at a time instead of in large chunks. Insertions and deletions are also much simpler using a graph, as we only need to update the incoming/outgoing links from the modified nodes. In contrast, in arroy these operations potentially trigger tree re-balancing right up to the root.\n\nDespite these drawbacks, arroy is still great in the sense that it's disk-based, being built on top of LMDB. This means that you can build and search through indexes that are much larger than your machine's RAM using mmap. For reference, many popular HNSW implementations operate entirely in RAM, which is fast but requires multiple nodes and partitioning if the dataset becomes too large. So arroy was pretty avant-garde in that respect.\n\nHannoy is a graph-based successor to arroy with KV-backed storage via LMDB.\n\nThe goal of hannoy is to combine the best of both worlds from arroy and graph ANNs into a production-ready vector database that maintains and improves upon key metrics vs the legacy system. What's also neat is that it makes heavy use of crates maintained by the Meilisearch devs, such as heed, roaring-rs, and steppe.\n\nIts implementation is inspired by a few projects, notably Faiss' HNSW and the hnsw crate, but with significantly more support for zero-copy semantics, persistence, SIMD, and online updates & multi-phase indexing. There are also several novel techniques inspired by research papers to handle tasks such as graph merges and layer exploration.\n\nThe most interesting engineering challenge of the project was determining how to handle incremental insertions and deletions to the graph over its lifetime. After all, we expect users' databases to grow over time, and not all their data is available immediately. The industry standard for graph algorithms had been to periodically rebuild the index either on a cron-like schedule or after sufficient updates had accumulated. The FreshDiskANN paper summarizes this issue with this type of approach succinctly:\n\nIt would take about 1.5-2 hours on a dedicated high-end 48-core machine to build a good-quality HNSW index over 100M points. So we would need three dedicated machines for constantly rebuilding indices to maintain even six-hourly freshness guarantee over a billion point index. [1]\n\nLuckily for us, Microsoft has already solved this problem. The idea essentially boils down to avoiding eager updates to the graph by orchestrating a streaming delete/insert/merge operation once the size of a particular in-memory temporary index reaches a critical size. While this is certainly a proven strategy, with hannoy we aimed to implement something a bit less complicated, but which still makes liberal use of techniques from DiskANN (even though technically hannoy is an HNSW).\n\nWhen items are added or deleted from the graph, a special Updated key is written to the database pointing to the modified node. Before building the index, we generate a bitset of items that are (i) new, (ii) modified, or (iii) removed & pass those to the HnswBuilder. The deletion bitset plays a special role at the end of the build where instead of just removing any edge $(e,d)$ between an existing and deleted item, we explore the neighbourhood of $d$ to patch the links of $e$ à la DiskANN. This prevents \"gaps\" from appearing in the graph and ensures search still converges quickly (recall that SNG property from earlier 😉).\n\nThe code below shows how we accomplish this in hannoy:\n\nAnother interesting feature of hannoy is how the new graph (in RAM) is merged with the old one (from disk, in LMDB). For each batch of points to be inserted, we build a brand new HNSW in RAM. To ensure that this new graph connects to the old one, we reschedule the entry points of the old graph for re-indexing in the new one. Every time we need to access an item's links, we look in both memory and LMDB. This way, we can establish connections with the larger disk-based index in a lazy manner. This is essential, as otherwise, any new vectors inserted into the database after the initial build would be unreachable; you'd only be able to search in disjoint graphs, and recall would suffer.\n\nThis strategy actually works well in practice ! By re-indexing <<1% of the vectors in the original graph, we're able to merge on-disk and in-memory indexes seamlessly. To the best of my knowledge, this is a novel technique that no other HNSW implementations utilize for handling incremental builds, and it is essential to the use case at Meilisearch, where batch insertions are heavily used.\n\nThere are tons of other cool sub-problems like those that we address in hannoy, but I'll save those for another post. The important part to retain here is that hannoy is \"a DiskANN-inspired HNSW implementation with LMDB-backed storage\".\n\nI like making unsubstantiated claims about the performance of my system as much as the next guy, but there comes a point when it's time to share some hard numbers. That time is now!\n\nTo facilitate comparison between the old system and the new one, we'll utilize the trusty vector-store-relevancy-benchmark from Meilisearch, as featured in previous blog posts. The important metrics we'll be comparing are recall (1, 10, 50, 100), indexing time, retrieval latency, and disk usage for various datasets with differing embedding dimensions. To simplify the process, we'll run the benchmark on 1 million documents using cosine as the indexing/retrieval distance metric in full precision. We'll also run the benchmark using each database's preferred quantization format.\n\nWhen quantization is enabled, arroy by default uses the cosine distance over the [0,1]-valued vectors. In hannoy, we've noticed that the hamming distance between binary strings (x^y) is vastly more performant in both speed and recall. Intuitively, the speed part makes sense as the distance computation reduces to popcnt's !\n\nThe results I'll be sharing are cherry-picked from the much more complete benchmarking summary in hannoy.\n\nNote that the reported search latency numbers represent the cold-start times. In reality, search times will speed up as more of the database is loaded into the page cache. From the flamegraph below, we can see that ~25% of our time is spent on mdb_get calls, so running a few warmup queries could significantly reduce retrieval times.\n\nAs you can see from these numbers, hannoy certainly improves upon all of the metrics we discussed - and by quite a large margin. In some cases, indexing times drop by nearly 10x, while the same amount improves search latencies.\n\nHaving a bit of free time on my hands, I thought I'd tackle writing the Python bindings for hannoy using pyo3. With these in place, it becomes much easier to integrate the project with the renowned ANN Benchmarks leaderboard.\n\nWhat's cool here is that even with the log(n) lookups from LMDB and potential page faults in our mmap, we're still beating in-memory annoy (arroy but in C) and competitive enough with Faiss' implementation. This graph indicates that we still have some work to do in terms of performance. Still, considering it was an initial implementation thrown together fairly quickly, it's certainly a good start. The most essential things for hannoy are ensuring that we keep the same API as arroy to facilitate integration in Meilisearch, and of course, that it improves on the metrics with respect to the previous system.\n\nI covered a lot of ground in this blog post, but still haven't answered the essential question \"Why the HNSW and not DiskANN?\" - and to be honest, I still don't have a satisfactory answer.\n\nOn one hand, the HNSW seemed the easiest out of the two to implement, given our constraint of using LMDB as a storage backend (DiskANN has a lot of async IO going on to maximize throughput on SSD reads, which aren't as straightforward to implement using mmap). From another perspective, HNSW is the gateway to graph ANNs and seemed like a good first approach to try out, validating whether this was a valid alternative to Meilisearch's prevailing vector database. If convincing results could be obtained with relatively little effort, it was certainly worth trying out. That being said, DiskANN and FreshDiskANN certainly influenced many of my design choices throughout, and I'm sure the project will evolve to resemble them more closely.\n\nI published this article everywhere on the internet, and if you want to comment, please take a look at Lobste.rs, Hackernews, Reddit, Twitter, Bsky or even post a comment in here 👇",

    "fullText": "With British airports Heathrow and Gatwick both landing among the top 10 busiest airports in Europe, the two have also struggled to decrease the flow of traffic around the areas where drivers drop off passengers.\n\nFollowing a similar decision made at Heathrow (LHR) earlier this year, Gatwick Airport (LGW) in the West Sussex county south of central London is also raising the price of driving up to the airport without stopping.\n\nThe fee increase, which does not apply to cars operating for rideshare companies like Uber and Bolt, comes into effect on January 6 and increases the fee charged to those dropping off friends and family by 43% from £7 to £10 ($13.37 USD).\n\nIt is also a significantly bigger jump than the £6 to £7 increase implemented at Heathrow, the main London airport serving flag carriers and mainstream airlines, for next year.\n\n\"This increase in the drop-off charge is not a decision we have taken lightly; however, we are facing a number of increasing costs, including a more than doubling of our business rates in the recent Budget,\" an airport spokesperson said in a statement reported by BBC and other local press outlets.\n\nThe airport also blamed higher business rates introduced by Chancellor Rachel Reeves as the reason for the price increase that it's now passing on to the airport visitors in different ways.\n\nThe increases at both Heathrow and Gatwick have been met with strong opposition from locals who regularly come to the airport. They see it as an example of price-gouging, presented as a \"benefit\" for passengers, or to shame people for not taking public transit to help the environment.\n\n\"Heathrow's decision to increase its terminal drop-off fee to £7 and introduce a strict 10-minute limit is yet another example of rising airport charges impacting the very people who keep our economy moving,\" Clive Wratten, who heads the British Business Travel Association, said in a statement.\n\n\"The words 'Happy New Year' are unlikely to be uttered by drivers dropping off friends and family at Gatwick in January,\" Rod Dennis, a senior policy advisor for British road breakdown service provider RAC, told The Independent.\n\n\"[...] Drivers tell us the main reason they use drop-off facilities at airports is to help people with bulky or heavy luggage – something that can be incredibly impractical on public transport, especially if elderly relatives or young children are in tow.\"",

    "fullText": "Funding to research new ways to control the sea lamprey, the invasive vacuum cleaner of the Great Lakes, is at risk. The development is prompting concerns from locals and observers.\n\nWisconsin Public Radio reported on how threatened funding and potential newfound resilience could lead to a comeback for the prolific fish-killer. The invasive lamprey uses a powerful suction-cup mouth to attach to fish, employs its 100 jagged teeth, and then kills them at a ruthless six-in-seven rate.\n\n\"They're kind of something out of a horror movie,\" journalist Katie Thornton told WPR. While the lamprey spares humans from its wrath, its presence can devastate native fish such as lake trout and whitefish.\n\nThat was what happened from 1944-1954, when Lake Michigan's commercial trout harvests decreased by a remarkable 98%. The government responded by forming the nonprofit Great Lakes Fishery Commission in the 1950s.\n\nThis organization discovered a chemical that specifically targeted lampreys, leading to a revival of native fish populations. From there, it was smooth sailing until the COVID-19 pandemic and, more recently, cuts by the Department of Governmental Efficiency impacted treatment.\n\nWhile that funding and staffing have been restored, there are concerning signs that the lamprey may be developing immunity to the pesticide. That alarm is heightened by the Trump administration's proposed 79% funding cut to the Great Lakes Science Center, a key player in researching alternative treatments.\n\nLeft untreated, the invasive sea lamprey is a complete menace. During COVID, Thornton revealed that one lake exploded with a tenfold rise in lampreys in just one year. That spells certain doom for fish that are both food and livelihood for many Midwesterners.\n\nWhile the threat has been neutralized for some time with an effective pesticide and treatment, resting on those laurels is a dangerous proposition. The invader is lethal and can make an impact incredibly quickly. Getting caught flat-footed would be devastating to the local fish population.\n\nThornton revealed that the process of identifying the chemical that controls lamprey took over five years and 5,000 attempts, which shows the dangers of waiting.\n\nThornton suggested to WPR that even in a Michigan region that is generally pro-Trump, there was widespread support for preserving the research funding. Locals remember the havoc the sea lamprey can wreak on the fish population and aren't eager to take their chances.\n\nDo you worry about companies drilling too deep into the ground?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nWhile the funding remains in balance, scientists are working on alternative paths to controlling the invasive species.\n\nThese involve a lot of cutting-edge technology, like electric dams that keep lampreys out through transmitted electric currents. Artificial intelligence is another option for detecting fish and blocking them from entering unwanted waters.\n\nA different approach includes using the scent of dead lampreys to control their movements. Another venture includes introducing sterile males into the population.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAfter the story gained national attention and intervention from Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), USPS reversed course. The postal service picked up the returned boxes with new customs declarations and agreed to resend them without charging additional postage (4).\n\n\"We wrote. We called. And we made an issue of it,\" Blumenthal told NBC Connecticut (5).\n\nUSPS acknowledged the issue but placed responsibility on the labeling. \"The shipping forms were not filled out correctly in line with current regulations — lack of detail on what was being shipped in the packages — which led to this delay,\" a spokesperson said (6).\n\nThe packages are now expected to arrive in time for the holidays. But the situation isn't fully resolved: approximately 150 packages remain missing, and some boxes marked for the Connecticut National Guard are still awaiting shipment (7).\n\nWhat happened to Boxes to Boots isn't an isolated incident. It reflects a broader shift in how USPS handles international shipments — including packages sent to military addresses overseas.",

    "description": "Gottlieb played college basketball at Brown and said she had a teammate whose daughter had to shelter in place in a library basement.",
    "fullText": "USC women’s basketball head coach Lindsay Gottlieb opened her postgame news conference after the No. 16 Trojans’ loss to No. 1 UConn on Saturday night with her thoughts on the mass shooting that took place at Brown University.\n\nProvidence police said Sunday morning that they had detained a person of interest after two people were killed and nine others were wounded in a shooting on campus during finals. The person is in their 30s. The shooting happened in an engineering building on campus as people in the area were told to shelter in place for hours afterward as police looked for the shooter.\n\nGottlieb played basketball at Brown and said that she checked her phone after the game to see many text messages about the shooting. She said she felt she needed to address the shooting because it was more important than basketball and that “we can all be better.”\n\n“It doesn’t need to be this way,” Gottlieb said. “Sending thoughts and prayers to my teammates who have kids there. To the parents that have to worry about their children, I’m just going to end it with that, but just to say we’re the only country that lives this way. The college football cycle has been in the news a million times and are we going to report about this? It’s the guns. We’re the only country that lives this way. Parents should not be worried about their kid — I have a teammate who has a daughter who is in the basement of a library because they don’t know what’s going on there. And she’s flying there tomorrow.\"\n\nPolice said the shooter had a handgun and fired more than 40 rounds during the incident. The mayor of Providence, Brett Smiley, said that the building’s outside doors were unlocked but that access to the classrooms where exams were taking place required a badge.\n\nGottlieb has been USC’s coach since 2021 after she spent two seasons as an assistant for the Cleveland Cavaliers following her time as Cal’s head coach. She played at Brown from 1995-99 and immediately got into coaching after her collegiate playing career was over.\n\nUSC lost 79-51 at home to UConn on Saturday night as the Trojans play the season without injured star JuJu Watkins. She injured her knee in the 2025 NCAA tournament before USC fell to UConn in the Elite Eight a season ago. Watkins, who suffered a torn ACL, will miss the entire 2025-26 season.",

Many communities that were sitting at 1 to 3 inches before sunrise are now in the 5 to 8 inch range, especially north and west of Philadelphia.\n\nIn the city, an observation from Center City lists 3.6 inches of snow, while neighborhoods in the Northeast like Fox Chase, Bustleton and Somerton are reporting between 4 and 5 inches. An official reading at Philadelphia International Airport shows 1.3 inches, underscoring the sharp gradient from the airport to the rest of the city.\n\nThe heaviest bands have focused on parts of Chester, Montgomery, Bucks, Lehigh, Carbon and Northampton counties, where multiple towns are now reporting 7 to 8 inches. South Jersey and northern Delaware have also seen a solid plowable snow, with widespread 4 to 7 inch totals in some communities.\n\nThese totals are based on reports collected through about 10:30 a.m. Sunday and may continue to rise where snow is still falling.\n\nCenter City/Philadelphia (observer): 3.6\"\n\nPhiladelphia International Airport: 1.3\"\n\nAtglen / West Sadsbury Twp: 7.8\"\n\nHarleysville / Salford Twp: 7.5\"\n\nPottstown area (including Stowe and NE Pottstown): 6.6\"–7.3\"\n\nWillow Grove / Jenkintown corridor: 6.0\"–6.4\"\n\nPerkasie / Souderton / Trumbauersville: around 7.0\"\n\nNewtown / Langhorne area: around 6.0\"\n\nBerks, Lehigh, Carbon and Northampton counties\n\nEast Nantmeal / Alburtis / Earl Twp / Lake Harmony / Lehigh Twp (Carbon): around 7.0\"–8.0\"\n\nMount Laurel / Burlington: 5.8\"\n\nWashington Twp (Gloucester): 5.5\"\n\nMonroe Twp (Gloucester): around 4.0\"\n\nAtlantic, Salem and Cumberland counties\n\nAtlantic City International Airport: 0.6\"\n\nNew Castle County Airport: 3.3\"\n\nSmyrna / Clayton / Cheswold area: around 2.0\"\n\nHighest total so far: 8.8\" in East Nantmeal Township (Chester County)\n\nOther standout totals: 8.7\" in Blue Bell (Montgomery County), 8.5\" in East Nottingham Township (Chester County), 8.0\" in Doylestown area, Coopersburg and parts of Carbon County\n\nCity of Philadelphia: generally 3\"–5\" away from the airport, with around 3.6\" in Center City and up to 5.0\" in Fox Chase\n\nMany suburbs: now in the 5\"–8\" range, especially north and west of the city\n\nSnow continues to impact travel across the region Sunday, with many neighborhood and secondary roads still snow-covered or slushy.

The LAPD said in an X statement that its Robbery Homicide Division was investigating an apparent homicide.\n\nIn a Sunday night statement, LA Mayor Karen Bass confirmed the Reiners' deaths and said that the investigation was ongoing.\n\nLAPD Deputy Chief Alan Hamilton said in a Sunday night press conference that the department was not seeking anyone as a suspect or person of interest in the case, and that the LAPD would speak with the couple's family members in the investigation.\n\nRepresentatives for the family did not immediately respond to Business Insider's requests for comment.\n\nFormer House Speaker and California Rep. Nancy Pelosi said in an X post on Sunday that the news was \"devastating.\"\n\n\"It's hard to think of anyone more remarkable and excellent in every field and endeavor they pursued,\" Pelosi wrote.\n\nShe added, \"Rob was creative, funny, and beloved. And in all of their endeavors, Michelle was his indispensable partner, intellectual resource, and loving wife.\"\n\nReiner had a long and illustrious career in Hollywood. The son of actor, director, and screenwriter Carl Reiner, he studied at the UCLA Film School before starting his directing journey.\n\nHe directed several iconic Hollywood movies, including \"This is Spinal Tap\" in 1984, \"The Princess Bride\" in 1987, and \"When Harry Met Sally\" in 1989.\n\nReiner also appeared in several acting stints, including movies such as the 2013 Martin Scorsese blockbuster \"The Wolf of Wall Street\" and TV series \"New Girl\" and \"The Bear.\"\n\nIn 1987, he founded Castle Rock Entertainment, a production company, alongside a group of film producers. The company is now a subsidiary of Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nReiner and his wife had three children together: Nick, Jake, and Romy Reiner. He has one daughter, Tracy Reiner, from his previous marriage to actor Penny Marshall.\n\nNick Reiner battled drug abuse in his teens and early adulthood. His experience, including stints in rehab, led him to write the screenplay for \"Being Charlie,\" a 2015 romance-drama that his father directed.\n\nIn 2016, Reiner told Business Insider that his son was the \"heart and soul of the film.\"",

    "fullText": "Michelle Obama says her mother didn't shy away from talking about death while she was growing up.\n\nSpeaking on Thursday's episode of her \"IMO\" podcast, featuring guest Anderson Cooper, Obama said it was her mother's way of preparing her and her brother for the inevitable.\n\nHer comments came after Cooper shared that his mother, Gloria Vanderbilt, also spoke openly about her mortality when he was young.\n\n\"I think she wanted me to know throughout my life, she wanted to hand us our lives early. Like you're responsible. You did this for yourself,\" Obama said. \"My mom would always say, and she would say this publicly, 'I didn't have anything to do with raising Michelle and Craig. They, you know, they always knew this.'\"\n\nObama added that she believed her mother said it to reassure herself that her children would be able to manage on their own, even when she was no longer around.\n\n\"And I didn't understand that until I had kids. And I realized that the scariest thing is not just losing them or something happening to them. It's something happening to me, and my kids are going to go through life not feeling like they have what they need to get through.\"\n\nThe former first lady, who has two daughters with her husband, Barack Obama, said her mother always reassured her that she was sensible and already making sound decisions even as a child.\n\n\"I think she was trying to tell me what you came to realize, that if you know your parents' values and their core, you've seen them, you've experienced them. If there's a loss, you're going to be OK,\" Obama said.\n\nThis isn't the first time that Obama has spoken about the lessons she learned from her mother, who died in May 2024.\n\nIn June, she said her mother was always upfront with her kids about her own shortcomings.\n\n\"What I remember so distinctly is Mom saying on more than one occasion, 'Hey, look, this is my first time being a parent, and I'm not sure if I'm doing it right.' And that always resonated with me,\" Obama said.\n\nIn November, Obama said one of her final conversations with her mother pushed her to be more intentional about how she spends her time now that she's in her 60s.\n\n\"If I'm lucky, I live to 90 and that's 30 good summers,\" Obama said.",

    "title": "AI is triggering a quiet hiring comeback for some entry-level talent, say public company CEOs",
    "description": "A new survey shows CEOs expect AI to boost hiring in 2026, especially for entry-level roles.",
    "fullText": "AI may be blamed for this year's layoffs, but a new global survey says the technology could fuel a rebound in some entry-level hiring next year.\n\nPublic-company CEOs say AI is creating more jobs in 2026, according to an annual outlook survey conducted by advisory firm Teneo released this month. Sixty-seven percent of the CEOs surveyed said they expect AI to increase entry-level hiring in 2026, and 58% said they plan to add senior-leadership roles as well.\n\nThe report said that firms are ramping up hiring in engineering and AI-related roles. Many existing jobs are being reconfigured or reassigned as certain tasks become increasingly automated.\n\nThe survey, conducted between October 14 and November 10, gathered responses from more than 350 global CEOs leading public companies with at least $1 billion in annual revenue, as well as about 400 institutional investors representing $19 trillion in portfolio value.\n\nThe findings run counter to the prevailing narrative that AI is automating entire jobs away.\n\n\"It's not that AI is wiping out the workforce today — it's reshaping it,\" said Ryan Cox, Teneo's global head of AI.\n\nThe hiring momentum mirrors a broader surge in corporate AI investment. Sixty-eight percent of CEOs said they plan to increase AI spending next year, up from 66% in 2025. Nearly nine in 10 CEOs said AI is already helping their organizations navigate disruption.\n\nAll that spending has raised expectations. More than half of investors said they expect AI initiatives to show results in under six months. CEOs aren't so sure: Only 16% of leaders at large-cap companies — with annual revenue of $10 billion or more — said such fast returns are realistic.\n\nFears that AI will eliminate human jobs have intensified as more companies announce layoffs tied to automation.\n\nHP said in a November earnings report that it plans to eliminate between 4,000 and 6,000 roles by the end of 2028 — a move expected to save about $1 billion. IBM announced in November that it would reduce its workforce by a \"single-digit percentage\" in the fourth quarter of 2025.\n\nBut the shift isn't as simple as workers being replaced by machines. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna told CNN in October that the company is simultaneously shifting head count toward AI and quantum computing, and plans to ramp up hiring of college graduates in the next year. AI adoption has also driven demand for programmers and sales employees, he told The Wall Street Journal in May.\n\nAI has created new job categories as it reshapes old ones. Titles such as decision designer and AI experience officer are emerging in the workforce, workplace experts said in a Business Insider report earlier this month. These roles focus on guiding AI systems and enhancing human-AI collaboration.",

    "description": "Halftime stumbles reveal Rockets' resilience. These third-quarter tests forge a stronger team, building crucial late-game composure and earning crucial April skills.",
    "fullText": "The Houston Rockets have a third-quarter problem. Not every night, not in the same way, but often enough that it’s become part of the rhythm of their games. Leads shrink. Momentum swings. Opponents find life. And suddenly a game that felt controlled turns into something that has to be earned again.\n\nAnd here’s the thing — that’s not all bad.\n\nYoung teams usually fall apart early or late. They come out flat or panic in the fourth. Houston doesn’t do that. Their issue tends to show up right after halftime, when adjustments get made and the game asks a slightly different question. That’s a much better problem to have.\n\nThird quarters are where discipline gets tested. The game resets. The adrenaline dips. Coaches counter. This is where teams that rely on feel get exposed, and teams that rely on structure have to prove it. Houston is still learning how to answer that moment consistently, and that learning curve is showing up in real time.\n\nSometimes it’s shot selection. Sometimes it’s pace. Sometimes the defense gets a little too aggressive and loses its shape. But what matters is what happens after. The Rockets don’t spiral. They don’t unravel. They regroup.\n\nThat’s the part people gloss over.\n\nThis team has become one of the better closing groups in the league not because they never make mistakes, but because they respond to them. Third-quarter lapses force them to lock back in. They force communication. They force leadership moments. Those are reps you don’t get when everything goes smoothly.\n\nAnd over time, those reps matter more than clean box scores.\n\nIme Udoka has clearly allowed these moments to breathe instead of overcorrecting them. There’s trust baked into that. Trust that the group will feel it, adjust, and execute when the game actually needs to be won.\n\nEventually, the third-quarter issues will tighten up. Most teams figure that out with experience. But even now, the Rockets are learning something more valuable: how to steady themselves when control slips.\n\nThat’s not a December skill. That’s an April one.\n\nAnd when the margins shrink later in the season, Houston won’t be surprised by discomfort. They’ve already lived in it — and learned how to come out the other side.",

    "description": "Tracking every incoming and outgoing player from Washington in the transfer portal this cycle",
    "fullText": "This is your place to keep track of everything Husky related in the transfer portal this season. The portal still doesn’t officially open until January 2nd but there are already some Husky players who have announced their intention to enter once available (or that intention has been reported by reputable sources). There won’t be any official offers to players until we hit January 2nd but we’ll include updates from Max Vrooman’s transfer portal rankings with every player in the portal with a tie to Washington in some way.\n\nHusky Players Expected to Enter the Transfer Portal (4)\n\nHarris was a three-star recruit out of powerhouse Bishop Gorman HS in Las Vegas, NV. He committed to Jedd Fisch at Arizona but transferred to Washington when Fisch took the job at UW. As a freshman, Harris played 72 offensive snaps across 9 games to burn his redshirt although nearly half of them were in the Sun Bowl. He finished with 2 catches for 17 yards.\n\nThis year it appeared Harris was passed on the depth chart by freshmen Raiden Vines-Bright, Dezmen Roebuck, and Chris Lawson. He played 5 games and was needed more heavily late in the year due to injuries at the receiver position. Harris’s highlight as a Husky was a 61-yard TD against Purdue.\n\nThank you Husky Nation for everything! It’s always love! 💜 https://t.co/Jvv34PVCWr\n\n— Audric Harris (@audricharris2) December 3, 2025\n\nBryant was a three-star recruit out of St. John Bosco in the class of 2023. Over his first two seasons at Washington he played 64 snaps as a reserve. Opportunity opened up for Bryant as Washington lost almost their entire linebacker corps from 2024 to eligibility or the portal. Bryant stepped up and surprisingly won a starting spot, starting the Huskies’ first 10 games this season.\n\nBut it was clear that the path to playing time would be harder next season with Jacob Manu and Zaydrius Rainey-Sale both back following 2024 ACL tears plus Buddah Al-Uqdah coming back from injury and Xe’ree Alexander playing well down the stretch. There was no way that there would be enough playing time for all 5 next season and so Bryant is the first of the group to depart as the only one of the group not initially signed by the current coaching staff.\n\nFYI: Husky LB Devin Bryant is not with the team in LA. Planning to enter the transfer portal. \n\nAlso, G Geirean Hatchett has been granted a waiver by the NCAA and is planning on returning to UW next year\n\n— Dave “Softy” Mahler (@Softykjr) December 14, 2025\n\nMcCutcheon was a three-star recruit in the class of 2021 having originally committed to Jimmy Lake as the slot corner in Lake’s defense. Lake of course was out by the end of McCutcheon’s freshman year but he stuck around under Kalen DeBoer playing 84 snaps over his 2nd and 3rd seasons in the program. McCutcheon once again stayed at UW when Jedd Fisch came in and in 2024 played 254 snaps as the backup nickel corner. He was seemingly passed on the depth chart by Rahshawn Clark in the preseason though and then suffered a season-ending injury in the first month of the year before playing a snap. He is hoping to earn a medical waiver for 2026 and otherwise would be out of eligibility so his departure doesn’t change UW’s expected scholarship count.\n\nNEW: Washington cornerback Dyson McCutcheon plans to enter the transfer portal, @PeteNakos reports. \n\nThe son of former NFL player Daylon McCutcheon missed the 2025 season but played in 12 games in 2024. He's seeking a sixth year of eligibility.https://t.co/kSYG7dYADj pic.twitter.com/NUWNgFnu3F\n\n— Transfer Portal (@TransferPortal) December 14, 2025\n\nBoyajyan was a three-star recruit out of Clovis, CA in the class of 2024. He signed with Washington as his only P4 offer with Washington looking to replenish an offensive line that had absolutely no depth when Jedd Fisch took over in Seattle. Boyayjyan hadn’t seen the field yet through two seasons and didn’t appear likely to be one of the top 8 linemen for next season barring a huge leap in the offseason.\n\nWashington OL Davit Boyajyan plans to enter the portal.\n\nBoyajyan signed with the Huskies in 2024 out of Clovis (Calif.) North- redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining. https://t.co/kUwKSzhG03 pic.twitter.com/44zbh4JQ1L\n\n— Brandon Huffman (@BrandonHuffman) December 14, 2025\n\nTransfer Portal Rankings Dashboard\n\nYou can access the dashboard here (the spacing is better than the embedded version here).",

    "description": "Philip Rivers fought back tears as he considered what message it would send to his sons, or the young men he has coached, that he nearly led the Indianapolis Colts to victory at age 44.",
    "fullText": "Philip Rivers fought back tears as he considered what message it would send to his sons, or the young men he has coached, that he nearly led the Indianapolis Colts to victory at age 44.\n\n“There is doubt, and it’s real,” Rivers said, choking up briefly. “The guaranteed safe bet is to go home or to not go for it, and the other one is, ‘Shoot, let’s see what happens.’ I hope in that sense that can be a positive to some young boys, or young people.”\n\nRivers ended a nearly five-year retirement to start Sunday against the Seattle Seahawks and played efficient football for the desperate Colts, who turned to the future Hall of Famer after Daniel Jones was lost for the season with a torn Achilles tendon.\n\nHe threw a touchdown pass in the first half, played mostly mistake-free and moved the Colts into position for Blake Grupe’s 60-yard field goal with 47 seconds left. But Jason Myers responded with a 56-yarder that gave the Seahawks an 18-16 victory.\n\nIt was a remarkable day for a grandfather who’s spent the past few years coaching high school football in his native Alabama.\n\nRivers took a few hard hits from the Seahawks’ stout defense, and he even enjoyed them.\n\n“I never minded that part of it,” Rivers said. “My wife always tells me I’m crazy because there’s been times in the last three or four years I said, ‘I wish I could just throw one and get hit – hard.’”\n\nThis wasn’t a novelty act, as it may have seemed when the Colts signed the Pro Football Hall of Fame semifinalist to their practice squad less than a week ago. Coach Shane Steichen’s Colts, who began the season 7-1 but are trying to stop a second-half collapse, knew what they were getting out of the veteran.\n\nRivers finished 18 of 27 for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception, with the pick coming on his final pass as he tried to force the ball down the field in the closing seconds.\n\n“I was just thankful — grateful — that I was out there,” Rivers said. “And it was a blast — it was a blast — but obviously the emotions now are disappointment. This isn’t about me. We have a team scrapping like crazy to try and stay alive and get into the postseason.”\n\nThe Colts (8-6) have dropped four straight and five of six, and they are outside the AFC playoff picture with three games left. They trail both Jacksonville and Houston in the AFC South.\n\nSteichen called a conservative game, relying on running the ball and controlling the clock. Rivers threw mostly short passes to the outside, checkdowns and screens.\n\n“He went out there and gave us a chance to win it,” Steichen said.\n\nRivers took two sacks, and he showed his age on the first one. He stumbled while evading pressure from Boye Mafe, got up, then fell again.\n\nRivers pumped his right fist and let out a roar after throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass to Josh Downs with 1:33 remaining in the first half to put the Colts up 13-3.\n\nIt was Rivers’ first touchdown pass since he threw a 27-yarder to Jack Doyle in the Colts’ 27-24 loss to Buffalo in a wild-card playoff game on Jan. 9, 2021. He also became the fifth player in NFL history to throw a TD pass at age 44 or older, joining Tom Brady, George Blanda, Steve DeBerg and Vinny Testaverde.\n\n“It’s been 1,800 days since I’ve thrown a touchdown — or interception for that matter. So we have both those (boxes) checked,” Rivers said.\n\nRivers was chosen last month as one of 26 semifinalists for the Hall of Fame’s class of 2026 but will now have his eligibility delayed. A player must be out of the league for at least five years before his candidacy can be considered. The earliest Rivers can be a candidate is for the class of 2031.\n\nHe ranks among the top 10 in NFL history in wins, attempts, completions, yards passing, touchdown passes and 300-yard games.\n\nSince his retirement, he’s been coaching at St. Michael Catholic High School in Fairhope, Alabama, where the team held a watch party on Sunday. Rivers’ players were on his mind as he returned to the NFL.\n\n“Maybe it will inspire or teach not to run or be scared of what may or may not happen,” Rivers said.",

    "description": "The Packers lost to the Broncos on Sunday. Here's what went right, what went wrong and what it means for the Packers moving forward.",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers gave up a 23-14 lead in the second half, lost several key players to injury and limped to the finish line of a 34-26 defeat at the hands of the Denver Broncos on Sunday at Empower Field at Mile High. Matt LaFleur's team had its four-game win streak snapped and is now 9-4-1, but the injuries to Micah Parsons and Christian Watson are the big story coming out of this defeat.\n\nHere's what went right, what went wrong and what it means for the Packers moving forward:\n\n-- Jordan Love was red hot in the first half, completing 17 of 21 passes for 215 yards and a touchdown as the Packers scored on their first four possessions.\n\n-- Josh Jacobs played through a right knee injury and produced 92 total yards and two big scores.\n\n-- Credit Edgerrin Cooper. There was no quit in him. He broke up a fourth down pass and had a tackle for loss on fourth down late in the fourth quarter, keeping the Packers alive. He finished with eight tackles, two for a loss and a pass breakup.\n\n-- The Packers run defense limited the Broncos to 2.9 yards per carry and didn't give up a run over eight yards.\n\n-- First-round pick Matthew Golden drew a pass interference penalty on a scoring drive, had a 27-yard catch, an 18-yard catch and an 11-yard catch converting a third down.\n\n-- Pretty much everything after Jordan Love threw a deep ball to Christian Watson with 12:46 left in the third quarter.\n\n-- The offensive line struggled post-Zach Tom. The passing game flat-lined post-Christian Watson. The defense couldn't rush Bo Nix post-Micah Parsons.\n\n-- The Packers defense gave up 23 completions, 304 passing yards and four touchdowns to Bo Nix, who wasn't sacked, didn't have a turnover and finished with a passer rating of 134.7. The secondary got burnt time and time again in big spots. The pass rush produced only three quarterback hits.\n\n-- The Broncos went 4-for-4 scoring touchdowns in the red zone. The Packers were 1-for-4 and settled for three field goals under 40 yards.\n\n-- Courtland Sutton tortured Keisean Nixon and Carrington Valentine to the tune of seven catches, 113 yards and one touchdown. The cornerbacks weren't good enough on Sunday.\n\n-- Love turned the ball over twice. On the first, he aggressively attacked downfield in a one-on-one opportunity with Christian Watson. On the second, he threw slightly behind Dontayvion Wicks. Both times, Love gave his receiver a chance to make a play. Neither was a perfect throw, and the Broncos made him pay. Denver scored seven points off two takeaways, Green Bay got only three points off one.\n\n-- The Packers were penalized 10 times for 72 yards. Many were completely avoidable infractions. Rasheed Walker was flagged four times.\n\n-- Given two opportunities with the ball down eight points in the fourth quarter, the Packers turned the ball over on downs on back-to-back possessions. Jordan Love took a sack on fourth down ending the first, and his pressured attempt on 4th-and-15 wasn't close to end the game.\n\n-- Xavier McKinney had three passes defensed, but he had two failed opportunities to make a game-changing interception right before Micah Parsons' noncontact injury.\n\nIt isn't hyperbole to say this defeat -- and everything that factored into it -- is season-altering for the Packers. Not only is Matt LaFleur's team now 9-4-1 and in second place in the NFC North, but losing Christian Watson and Micah Parsons to injuries significantly lowers the Packers' championship potential entering the final three games. In fact, if both are done for the season, the championship potential for Green Bay might be zero. Watson had supercharged the passing game. Parsons was the most important player on the team not named Jordan Love. They are indispensable players. The Packers might only need one more win to get into the postseason, but winning the division just got a lot more challenging, and it's extremely difficult to envision the Packers going on the road and winning three straight games without Watson and Parsons. It sure feels like an ascending team that was becoming title worthy just had the rug pulled out from under it in the most devastating way.\n\nSomehow, the Packers must shake off this loss, recover from a physical, injury-filled afternoon in the altitude in Denver, put together a game plan without several important pieces available and go into Chicago and beat the Bears -- who won on Sunday -- at Soldier Field on Saturday night. If the Packers want to win the NFC North and host a playoff game in January, winning next Saturday is a must. Big stakes involved in the rematch.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Packers Wire: Breaking down Packers' 34-26 loss to Broncos: What went right, wrong",

    "description": "The Yankees are a finalist to sign one of the top free agent pitchers.",
    "fullText": "The Yankees never wanted to trade pitcher Michael King. They loved the right-hander when he was a multi-innings, high-leverage reliever at the start of his career and they loved him after he went into their rotation in August 2023.\n\nReluctantly, they had to do it.\n\nThat’s the only way the Padres would sign off on trading star outfielder Juan Soto during the 2023 Winter Meetings. King was the centerpiece of the Padres’ return in a blockbuster deal on Dec. 7, 2023 that sent Soto and center fielder Trent Grisham to New York for King, young pitchers Randy Vasquez, Jhony Brito and Drew Thorpe, and veteran catcher Kyle Higashioka.\n\nTwo years later, King is a free agent and the Yankees would like to get him back even though their loaded with starting pitching.\n\nAccording to the Boston Globe, King is considering signing with the Yankees and two of their AL East rivals, the Red Sox and Orioles. A Rhode Island native and Boston College alum, King has “strong interest” in signing with the Red Sox, MassLive reported.\n\nMLB Trade Rumors ranked King No. 14 on its list of top 50 free agents this offseason and predicted he’s get a four-year contract worth $80 million.\n\nIf the Yankees sign King, he could be in a season-opening rotation that includes All-Star left-hander Max Fried, 2024 AL Rookie of the Year Luis Gil and a pair of right-handers who impressed as rookies this past season, Will Warren and Cam Schlitter.\n\nBut with All-Star left-hander Carlos Rodon expected to return from his offseason surgery by late April and former Cy Young winner Gerrit Cole due back from Tommy John surgery in May or June, the Yankees could follow a King signing by dealing one of their starters, perhaps Gil. Also, Clarke Schmidt is expected back late in the season from his Tommy John surgery,\n\nKing, 30, was 5-3 with a 3.44 ERA in 15 starts in an injury-plagued 2025 season with the Padres. He was on the IL from May 25 to Aug. 9 and from Aug. 14 to Sept. 9 with shoulder inflammation.\n\nFor his career, he’s 31-29 with a 3.24 ERA in 16 games, 64 as a starter.\n\nHis best season was 2024 when he was 13-9 with a 2.95 ERA in 31 games, 30 starts, for the Padres.\n\nKing began his career with the Yankees mostly pitching as a multi-inning, high-leverage reliever. From 2019 through 2023, he had a 13-17 record for the Yankees with a 3.38 ERA in 115 games, 19 as a starter.\n\nHere are other recent NJ.com Yankees posts to check out:\n\n-- Yankees add free agent bat for protection if Cody Bellinger moves on\n\n-- Yankees add cancer survivor for bullpen depth\n\n-- Yankees free agent finds new home\n\n-- Yankees fans mad about payroll?

    "description": "What Colts coach Shane Steichen and quarterback Philip Rivers said about who will start vs 49ers next week",
    "fullText": "SEATTLE — From the way Shane Steichen and Philip Rivers are talking, it does not sound like there is much question about who the starting quarterback will be when the Colts take the field on ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” against the 49ers.\n\nRivers was clearly limited in Sunday’s 18-16 loss to the Seahawks, completing 18 of 27 passes for just 120 yards, one touchdown and one interception.\n\nBut the Colts liked the way he managed the game, avoided turnovers and gave Indianapolis a chance to win at the end, although the kickoff unit and the defense weren’t able to hold the lead.\n\n“Very encouraged,” Indianapolis head coach Shane Steichen said. “There's no question about it. For him to go out there and do what he did after five years off, to have a chance to win it and get a game-winning field goal, close to it, obviously, with 40 seconds left, in a hostile environment, against a tough defense just shows his commitment to coming back.”\n\nIndianapolis decided to roll the dice on a 44-year-old Rivers instead of sixth-round rookie Riley Leonard for several reasons.\n\nRivers’ experience, knowledge of the offense, ability to get the Colts into the right plays and encyclopedic knowledge of what defenses are trying to do gave him the edge over Leonard’s age and athleticism.\n\nLeonard completed 18 of 29 passes for 145 yards, no touchdowns and an interception in relief of Daniel Jones last week in Jacksonville, but Leonard is dealing with a reported PCL sprain in his right knee, although he was able to practice in full all week long.\n\nThe Colts wanted to see if Rivers could handle the rigors of an NFL game.\n\nFrom what they saw on Sunday, it looks like the 44-year-old can handle it, even being hit after five years away from the NFL.\n\n“I never minded that part of it,” Rivers said. “My wife always tells me I'm crazy because there's been times in the last three or four years I said I wish I could just throw one and get hit hard. She says, that's not normal. … The one where the ball was snapped didn't feel great, but the other ones kind of got me going in the game.”\n\nRivers acknowledged that the offense wasn’t very explosive on Sunday.\n\nBut he also talked like a quarterback who expects to start next week.\n\n“It's going to continue to get better,” Rivers said. “This is obviously the first one, we're talking about three days of practice.”\n\nRivers wasn’t entirely happy with his performance.\n\nOr the offense’s. Indianapolis scored 13 points in the first half, but the Colts were held scoreless in the second half until Blake Grupe’s go-ahead field goal with 47 seconds left, giving Indianapolis a one-point lead that Seattle erased in 25 seconds.\n\n“I'm speaking offensively,” Rivers said. “If I can stay healthy — like, I feel good — it's gonna get better as we go, but the catch in that is we gotta win. Doesn't really matter if it's getting better as we go, we gotta win, or it's going to be over in three weeks. That's the catch.”\n\nRivers was already talking like a quarterback thinking about ways the offense can be better.\n\nThe 44-year-old came back to the Colts in a Hail Mary attempt to get Indianapolis into the playoffs. He wants to see it through.\n\n“Certainly going to quickly turn my attention to the 49ers,” Rivers said. “I know they have a Monday night game (at Lucas Oil Stadium). I never got to experience that, either, in that COVID year. And we're going to scratch and fight and claw. I do know that. Not because I'm here. But I do know that any team I've ever been a part of, not because of me, but I've been a part of, will fight like crazy until they tell us the season is over. So you can guarantee that for the next three weeks.”\n\nJoel A. Erickson and Nathan Brown cover the Colts all season.

    "description": "How did the Saints upset the Panthers in Week 15's final seconds? By leaning on a young quarterback who continues to deliver when it matters most.",
    "fullText": "In dramatic fashion, the New Orleans Saints secured their second straight divisional win, edging the Carolina Panthers 20-17 to complete a season sweep. Now 4-10 on the year, New Orleans oddly finds itself 3-2 within the NFC South – effectively throwing a wrench into the plans of the teams jockeying for position at the top of the division.\n\nHow did they do it? By leaning on a young quarterback who continues to deliver when it matters most, paired with a defense that has fully embraced a bend-but-don’t-break identity — and broken through at the most critical moments.\n\nA lot went right once again for the Saints, but let’s break down this Week 15 statement win by answering four key questions:\n\nSimply put: a lot. The Saints showed resilience, composure, and timely execution en route to their second straight divisional victory – one that continues to complicate things for their rivals. At the center of it all was rookie quarterback Tyler Shough, who once again proved capable of rising to the moment. After a relatively slow start — aside from an impressive 17-play, 95-yard touchdown drive — Shough took control in the second half. He completed 15 of 19 passes (excluding a late-game spike) and led the Saints on four consecutive scoring drives, three of which ended in points.\n\nWhat stood out most was his command in long down-and-distance situations. Shough converted seven throws on downs of 10+ yards, nearly adding an eighth on a 17-yard completion to DeVaughn Vele on second-and-18 that left the Saints just a yard short. A quick glance at the third-down numbers tells part of the story as well, with New Orleans converting six of 11 attempts.\n\nIt’s clear that Shough has injected confidence into this offense in moments that felt tight earlier in the season. It wasn’t perfect — nor does it need to be — but with Shough under center, the Saints are winning games, and he’s beginning to look more and more like a legitimate part of the franchise’s future. The defense also deserves significant praise. While far from dominant from start to finish, they came up with their biggest plays when it mattered most. Early in the fourth quarter, trailing by seven with Carolina driving, the Saints defense delivered a massive fourth-and-one stop, preventing the Panthers from extending their lead to double digits.\n\nTwo drives later, after forcing a three-and-out, defensive end Chase Young made perhaps the play of the game – sacking Bryce Young on first-and-10 after Carolina had just converted a critical third-and-long with under two minutes remaining. The sack swung momentum, forced a punt, and set the stage for the Saints’ game-winning drive. And finally, credit where it’s due – Charlie Smyth delivered. After connecting on a 42-yard field goal earlier, the rookie kicker calmly drilled a 47-yard game-winner with two seconds remaining, the first walk-off kick of his young career. Moments like that can define confidence for a young specialist.The vibes were as high as they’ve been in New Orleans all season.\n\nDespite the strong finish, the Saints once again struggled out of the gate offensively. Two early drives – a 3-play, 4-yard and 6-play, 17-yard drive drained early momentum from a crowd eager for a fast start. While the offense responded in the second half, slow starts like this can be costly against more complete opponents.\n\nThe defense faced similar issues early. Carolina scored on three of its first four possessions, consistently moving the ball on the ground and extending drives on third down. Credit the unit for tightening up after halftime, but the early lapses mirrored what we saw against Miami a few weeks ago – the difference this time was finishing the job.Faster starts on both sides of the ball would allow this team to build separation rather than fighting until the final whistle.\n\nThe Saints have officially made things interesting. With a rookie quarterback leading the way, New Orleans has rattled off back-to-back wins after once being projected to pick inside the top 3-5 of next year’s draft – with major questions still looming at quarterback. That narrative is starting to shift. If this upward trend continues, the Saints may pivot from searching for a quarterback to aggressively building around one. How they close out the final three games will go a long way in shaping the organization’s offseason approach.\n\nNext Sunday, the Saints return home to host the New York Jets – a matchup with real implications for draft positioning at the top of the board. That said, based on recent play, this is another winnable game for New Orleans and an opportunity to secure a third straight victory.\n\nFinishing the season strong may be the most important objective for this team moving forward. With a young quarterback instilling confidence across the roster, momentum matters — not just for the locker room, but for the veterans already in place and the free agents the organization will evaluate come March.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Instant analysis: What went right, what went wrong in Saints-Panthers",

    "fullText": "The Patriots entered Sunday 11-2 with a chance to clinch the AFC East with a win.\n\nThey started the game against the Bills looking like they’d have a great chance to do just that, going up 21-0 and taking a 24-7 lead into halftime.\n\nBut then things fell apart in the second half, with Buffalo going on to win 35-31.\n\n“I mean, we weren’t able to get any stops,” head coach Mike Vrabel said postgame, via transcript from the team. “When we had an opportunity to make a play, we weren’t able to make it. Penalties. And that’s how this game goes. A few small plays make the difference. We were very prepared for this team to — we were going to need 60 minutes to beat this team.\n\n“This is a good football team. We had a lot of good football in there. And we had a lot of plays that, a few plays we’d like to have back that we’ll have to learn from.”\n\nQuarterback Josh Allen specifically made plenty of second-half plays — which was no surprise from the reigning MVP. He finished the contest 19-of-28 passing for 193 yards with three touchdowns and no picks. He added 48 yards on the ground via 11 carries.\n\n“He’s 6’5″, 250 pounds, runs fast, hard to tackle, hard to get down on the ground. He has an accurate, strong arm. I’m giving you a dissertation on a league MVP,” Vrabel said. “Just watch all the games and know that it’s the same as it was last week. Had a guy free. Weren’t able to make the play. Last week’s team had a guy free, we weren’t able to make a play. That’s why they drafted him and that’s why they pay him 60 million dollars.\n\n“I don’t know what to tell you. Just exactly what we knew what it was going to be, that we were going to need to get a stop or be able to tackle and if we pressured and we came free — so hopefully we get another opportunity to do that. But that won’t be for, I don’t know, but whenever we do… We’ll have to be ready for the quarterback that we have this week.”\n\nThe Patriots will be on the road to face quarterback Lamar Jackson and the Ravens before facing the Jets on the road and the Dolphins at home to cap the 2025 regular season.",

    "fullText": "Broncos may have some significant injury concerns coming out of win over Packers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Denver Broncos were victorious over one of the best teams in the NFC on Sunday. They clinched a playoff berth and saw the Kansas City Chiefs officially eliminated from playoff contention. It was a good day to be a Broncos fan. But good news often comes with some bad news.\n\nDuring the 34-26 win over the Packers, the Broncos saw starting safety Brandon Jones and running back RJ Harvey leave the game with injuries. These would be considered significant losses if these players miss any time, and it seems as though that could happen.\n\nStarting with Jones, who has been nothing short of terrific for the Broncos, he left the game with a chest injury, which is also being reported as a pectoral injury. P.J. Locke stepped in for him, but Locke is a considerable downgrade from Jones.\n\nThe combination of Jones and Talanoa Hufanga at safety has been one of the main reasons the Broncos' defense has been what it is this season. Locke has plenty of playing experience, but he lacks the physicality and overall athleticism that Jones brings to the lineup.\n\nAs for Harvey, he left the game late, after scoring his 10th touchdown of the season, with what was called a rib injury by sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson. That is concerning mainly because the Broncos are already thin at running back following the loss of J.K. Dobbins a few weeks ago.\n\nNot having Harvey available would force the Broncos into a tight spot. The only other running backs on the 53-man roster are Tyler Badie and Jaleel McLaughlin. Neither of them is an every-down back. The team recently signed Sincere McCormick to the practice squad, so he could get a look as well.\n\nREAD:Broncos' Christmas night showdown vs. Chiefs has become easier, less interesting\n\nBoth of these players missing any length of time would be a tough blow for the Broncos to deal with at this stage of the season.

    "description": "The young Longhorns couldn’t match the Badgers in a decisive loss.",
    "fullText": "Another deep run in the NCAA Tournament is over for the No. 1 seed Texas Longhorns (26-4) after falling to the No. 3 seed Wisconsin Badgers (28-4) in the Elite Eight on Sunday at Gregory Gymnasium in a 3-1 defeat.\n\nTexas was consistently out of system for the entire match and struggled to consistently match Wisconsin in any area of the game even though the Horns held a statistical edge in several categories. The biggest issue was the subpar performance from junior outside hitter Torrey Stafford, who hit .132 with nine kills and four attacking errors — the Longhorns needed more from their star, outshone on her home court by Badgers standout Mimi Colyer notching a match-high 23 kills on a .309 hitting percentage.\n\nThe young Texas team struggled to find answers across the board as head coach Jerritt Elliott tried to find sparks from his bench, a failed effort.\n\nIn the first set, both teams came out swinging and stayed neck to neck attacking the net at 5-5. True freshman outside hitter Abby Vander Wal aided the Longhorns with four kills during the set, alongside fellow true freshman outside hitter Cari Spears landing three kills in the first set. Texas was able to gain a small lead as Wisconsin continued to capitalize on attacks and force errors to gain a 23-17 lead. Longhorn middle blocker Nya Bunton snagged a two kills for Texas as the match closed out with Wisconsin taking the opening set, 25-22, despite the Longhorns saving five set points.\n\nIn the second set, Wisconsin jumped out to an early 4-2 lead with Colyer snagging early kills. The Longhorns cut the lead to 11-10 by forcing attacking errors, but the Badgers stayed steady, maintaining their lead with outside hitter Grace Egan swinging strong at the net to extending the lead to 18-13. The Longhorns stayed in the match with the leadership of senior outside hitter Whitney Lauenstein tagging four late kills, but the Badges closed the second set, 25-21, having never trailed in it.\n\nAll gas in the intense third set with both teams pumping attack after attack with the Longhorns taking a 8-7 lead. While both teams stayed on each others heel’s by countering each other’s attacks until Longhorn setter Rella Binney served back-to-back aces to put Texas up 15-12. The Longhorns stood strong at the net, forcing Badger errors to close the third set, 25-20, to prolong the match, albeit only briefly.\n\nIn the fourth set, the Longhorns use the momentum from the third set and go on a 4-0 run with kills from Vander Wal and Spears. The Badgers did not lay down as they were able to for errors and counter attack with the aid of outside hitter Una Vajagic to go on a 12-4 run, putting Wisconsin up, 12-8. The Longhorns managed a 4-0 run while libero Ramsey Gary landed an ace bring the match to 18-15, but the Badgers eventually closed the fourth and final set by forcing seven Longhorn errors to end the match, 25-19.",

    "fullText": "Bayern hosted Hamburger SV for the first time in 13 years in the Frauen-Bundesliga. HSV was promoted to the top division this season, but has struggled in this campaign — with only one win twelve matches so far.\n\nIt took Bayern more than a quarter hour to get on the scoresheet, but Germany captain Giulia Gwinn opened the scoring with a beautiful goal. In the 28th minute, Bayern captain Georgia Stanway earned a penalty and stepped up to take it herself. She buried it to make it 2-0. Shortly before halftime, Klara Bühl ran onto a rebounded ball in the box and slotted it low and strong into the back of the net. Bayern was cruising at halftime, up 3-0.\n\nThey did not wait too long to get back to scoring after the break. In the 48th minute, Gwinn played a ball into the box, looking for Pernille Harder, but a HSV defender headed it into the back of the net. The own goal put the hosts up 4-0. Harder would have to wait until the 64th minute, but she finally got her goal to make it 5-0. The final goal came in the 86th minute, when Lea Schüller fired home beautiful header after a Bayern freekick to make it 6-0.\n\nBayern had five different goal scorers — plus the own goal in their dominant performance. They remain at the top of the table with 37 points — six points ahead of second place Wolfsburg. They will host Norwegian side Valerenga in the Champions League play before finishing the calendar year with a trip to Leverkusen for a league match. In March Hamburg will host Bayern in the next round of the DFB-Pokal Frauen.",

    "description": "The former BYU quarterback was a late transfer from BYU to Tulane, but things worked out — for BYU and for Retzlaff.",
    "fullText": "Long before BYU knew it was out of the College Football Playoff, Jake Retzlaff was already in. As a result of Tulane’s 34-21 victory over North Texas on Dec. 5 in the American Conference championship game, the Green Wave, led by the former Cougar quarterback, clinched a spot in college football’s ultimate contest.\n\nRetzlaff and No. 11 Tulane play at No. 6 Ole Miss on Saturday (1:30 p.m., TNT) in a rematch of their Sept. 20 game that didn’t go so well for the Green Wave. The Rebels limited Retzlaff to 56 yards passing and 51 yards rushing in a 45-10 victory.\n\n“I’m excited. It’s going to be a great opportunity, especially considering we didn’t even get off the plane when we played those guys the first time,” Retzlaff said. “This is a chance to make a statement on a national spotlight.”\n\nLast summer, Retzlaff was in the national spotlight for a different reason. A woman filed a civil lawsuit accusing the quarterback of sexual assault. The case was dismissed but a looming multiple-game suspension related to BYU’s honor code led Retzlaff to look elsewhere for his senior season.\n\nDisappointed, but determined, Retzlaff quietly slipped out of town.\n\n“I’ve had some really good guidance over my career — people telling me to go out the right way and stay connected to so many people that are important to me,” he said. “There are a lot of special people at BYU who are family to me, especially in that locker room.\n\n“I could probably say a lot about how or why I left, but Cougar Nation has been so great to me. I don’t feel the need to tear anyone else down. There are too many guys I care about there to say anything bad about that program.”\n\nAs Retzlaff drove away from the BYU campus last summer, his mind was full of questions. The place he had grown to love was in his rear-view mirror with an open road of uncertainty in front of him.\n\n“I knew that wherever I went, if there was an opportunity to play, that I’d have a chance to succeed,” he said. “When I found out it was Tulane, I knew we had a great chance to be that G5 team to break into the playoff.”\n\nWith no guarantee of playing time, Retzlaff had to win the starting job during fall camp and win over the team while he was doing it. As for getting the playbook down, for that he relied on his BYU experience.\n\n“I learned a lot about football from A-Rod (Aaron Roderick), Matt Mitchell, Fesi (Sitake), Harvey (Unga), TJ Woods. I learned a lot from those guys,” Retzlaff said of his former staff at BYU. “So, a lot of it was just translating the verbiage. I had already done a lot of these things before.”\n\nAfter being named Tulane’s starter, Retzlaff led the Green Wave to victories against Northwestern (23-3), South Alabama (33-31) and eventual ACC champion Duke (34-27) before running into Ole Miss. He followed the loss with another trio of wins against Tulsa (31-14), East Carolina (26-19) and Army (24-17).\n\n“This team came together like glue throughout the season,” Retzlaff said. “Truthfully, I didn’t know how it would go with me being so new and trying to get to know the guys. We have grown a lot.”\n\nFlying high at 6-1 and just outside the top 25, Tulane took a road trip to face UTSA on Oct. 30 in San Antonio. Retzlaff knew he missed BYU, but he didn’t realize how much until Tulane’s team bus pulled up to the Alamodome.\n\nDue to his untimely departure, Retzlaff never had a “last game” experience at LaVell Edwards Stadium. There was no senior walk or final hurrah in front of the home fans. But he did have the Alamo Bowl.\n\n“The emotions that came to me when I walked into that building were the exact same feelings I had when I walked in with BYU,” he said. “I went over to the locker where I had sat at — it was surreal.”\n\nIn what had to seem like only days before, Retzlaff’s mind raced back to Dec. 28 when his underdog Cougars lit up No. 23 Colorado 36-14. Not only did the victory push BYU (11-2) up to No. 13 in the final AP Top 25, but an Alamo Bowl record 7,996,679 television viewers watched them do it.\n\nThe win catapulted the Cougars into an optimistic offseason and spring practice, fused by the kind of momentum that fuels a contender for the following year. But it wasn’t to be. At least not in the way Retzlaff had thought — and certainly not in a green and white uniform.\n\n“It was an emotional experience going back to the Alamo Bowl. It just goes to show how I feel about my time at BYU,” he said. “I’m so grateful for my experience and it’s something nobody can take away from me.”\n\nUTSA hammered Tulane 48-26. Retzlaff and the Green Wave responded by winning the next five games to crack into the top 25 and reach the program’s first College Football Playoff. Throughout all of it, he has kept a close eye on his former team.\n\n“They have been so fun to watch. Every time they were on, I was glued to the television,” he said. “Boy, has that little kid, LJ Martin, grown up and become something.”\n\nMartin rushed for 1,305 yards and 12 touchdowns during BYU’s 11-2 regular season and was named Big 12 Offensive Player of the Year.\n\n“One of our first interactions on the field was during a player-run-practice before our first seasons,” Retzlaff said. “I was getting mad at him because he screwed up a play. It is literally his first day on the field, but that never changed our relationship.”\n\nWith Retzlaff’s departure, BYU turned the offense over to true freshman Bear Bachmeier who earned the Big 12’s Freshman Offensive Player of the Year.\n\n“Me and Bear have a good relationship,” Retzlaff said. “I texted him once or twice during the season.”\n\nJust as Retzlaff transformed Tulane, Bachmeier led the Cougars to the program’s first Big 12 championship game and a date in the Pop-Tarts Bowl against No. 22 Georgia Tech on Dec. 27 (1:30 p.m., ABC).\n\nRetzlaff’s 2025 stats at Tulane are comparable to what he did last season at BYU. He threw for 2,947 yards and 20 touchdowns for the Cougars, and he is up to 2,862 yards passing and 14 touchdowns for the Green Wave. Retzlaff reduced his interceptions from 12 to 6 and increased his touchdown runs from 6 to 16.\n\n“The biggest and hardest thing was getting that chemistry with the guys,” he said. “I’ve run the ball super effectively this year and learning to command a new offense has been fun.”\n\nMost of all, Retzlaff continues to win. Over the last two seasons at BYU and Tulane, he is 22-4 as a starter with a win in a bowl game and an upcoming date in the playoffs.\n\n“Doing it as a team. That might be a boring answer, but that’s the truthful answer,” said Retzlaff about his successes. “I’ve also been lucky. I’ve had some great defensive teams to play with, some great coordinators and coaches. The way it works is the team has to come together as one with no one out there being selfish.”\n\nThese are good days for Retzlaff. After winning the American Championship, ABC cameras followed him parading around Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in New Orleans as if he had been riding the Green Wave his entire life.\n\nAlong the way, Retzlaff stopped and pulled a young lady from the stands — his longtime girlfriend Jaelynn Lambert, a senior on the BYU softball team. She has been there for him through his wild ride and this spring, Retzlaff vows to be back at Gail Miller Field — for her.\n\nAlso noticeable on championship night was his mustache.\n\n“I decided to give it a shot, why not? It’s been working for me,” he joked. “I added it in the middle of the season. It was a process to get it to where it is now.”\n\nThe same can be said for Retzlaff himself. It has been a process to get to where he is now. He’s been up, down and in between — and always imperfect. Humbled by his mistakes and motivated by redemption, Retzlaff remains a BYU story even as he marches Tulane into the College Football Playoff.\n\nDave McCann is a sportswriter and columnist for the Deseret News and is a play-by-play announcer and show host for BYUtv/ESPN+.

    "title": "Quinn Hughes ‘Extremely Open-Minded’ About Future With Wild After First Night In Minnesota",
    "description": "Hughes arrives in Minnesota, impressing immediately with his calm demeanor and on-ice performance, fueling excitement for his future with the Wild.",
    "fullText": "ST. PAUL, Minn - Quinn Hughes has been in Minnesota for about a day. He came in on a flight last night with Wild General Manager and President of Hockey Operations Bill Guerin and Assistant General Manager Chris Kelleher.\n\n\"Yeah, he’s a funny guy,\" Hughes said about Guerin and his flight. \"Obviously, a tremendous career, and I really appreciate him trading the assets that he did to get me. Some teams, they’re in until they hear what they have to trade to get me, but Billy was just full in. I think that was his first offer. So, obviously I want to do what I can here and prove him right. How he handled me with the 4 Nations last year, too, gave me a glimpse of what a good person he is. And, honestly, he was a big reason why I wanted to come here.\"\n\nHis comfort level stood out immediately. The way he carried himself after the game was incredible. He was calm, confident, and thoughtful. It made it feel less like he had just arrived and more like he had been part of the organization for years.\n\nThat ease carried over onto the ice.\n\nHe played his first game with the Wild on Sunday night amid a raucous home crowd that made its presence felt long before the puck dropped.\n\nWarmups brought a noticeable buzz. Each touch of the puck drew a reaction from the 18,322 in attendance. The response from the stands was immediate, and so was Hughes’ awareness of it.\n\n\"It was pretty special honestly,\" he said. \"I wasn’t expecting that. But that was very cool. I know it’s a hockey market but that was exciting.\"\n\nThe Roar Said Everything: Wild Fans Welcome Quinn Hughes From roaring ovations to custom jerseys, Minnesota Wild fans declared their support for new defenseman Quinn Hughes.\n\nFor a player of Hughes’ stature — a Norris Trophy winner, a franchise defenseman, and one of the NHL’s premier puck-movers in the league, first impressions matter. Minnesota, in a span of hours, made one.\n\nMinnesota toppled the Boston Bruins on Sunday for Hughes' debut by beating them 6-2. Hughes scored a goal and was the first star of the night even though both Kirill Kaprizov and Ryan Hartman had three points.\n\nHeck, Kaprizov tied Mikko Koivu for second all-time in goals and the media still selected Hughes as the first star.\n\n“The first thing is just the players and the guys in the room. Just getting a glimpse, obviously I met everyone four hours ago. Just how great the room has been and welcoming and obviously on the ice today just some of the elite talent they have,\" Hughes said on what excites him most about the Wild.\n\n\"Kirill gave me a pass in the second. I just wasn’t ready for it, and I would have had an open net. But as time goes on here, I start to read off him he starts to read off me. I think it’s going to take four, five, six games. But once we get rolling, I think we’re going to be hard to beat.”\n\nthe smile speaks for itself 😃 pic.twitter.com/GincKFeZ6E\n\n— Minnesota Wild (@mnwild) December 15, 2025\n\nHughes, 26, was drafted by the Vancouver Canucks in 2018. He had been with them since but knew his time there could be coming to an end recently. His agent Pat Brisson and Canucks President of Hockey Operations Jim Rutherford worked on a list of places that Hughes would fit well in.\n\n\"Yeah, honestly, I don’t know how much I’m allowed to say, but the ultimate respect for Jim Rutherford and Francesco Aquilini and the Aquilini Family. They were first class with everything that was going on. Obviously, it was a tough situation, but it felt like it was time. And I think Jim did too. But Jim and Pat, very lucky to have him. They were kind of talking a lot about places I might feel comfortable. And Jim was amazing with that. He cared about the person. He wanted me to go where he thought I’d be happy.\"\n\nIn the third period, Brock Faber made a play in the neutral zone to send the puck up the gut. Nicolas Aube-Kubel once touched passed it to Ryan Hartman who skated in and dropped it off for Hughes who scored his first goal with the Wild.\n\nWELCOME TO QUINNESOTA pic.twitter.com/fqO9796iVC\n\n— Minnesota Wild (@mnwild) December 15, 2025\n\nIt was the loudest I have ever heard the arena when he scored and when they announced his goal call. The State of Hockey is so pumped to have a superstar like Hughes and Sunday night showed why.\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely, warm-ups I think was the loudest I’ve ever heard it since I’ve played here,\" Faber said. \"Obviously, everyone’s excited. The State of Minnesota is excited to get a player and person of that caliber, it doesn’t happen often that a guy like that gets moved, so it was really cool and it’s going to be a lot of fun to watch for our fans.\"\n\nBut this really doesn't all happen without the Wild's management and Hughes spoke so glowingly of them, but especially Guerin.\n\nThe hockey fit was important, obviously, but the people fit may have mattered just as much to Hughes and to the Wild.\n\nHughes spent time with Wild general manager Bill Guerin during the flight to Minnesota, and that interaction left an impression that extended far beyond small talk.\n\nMeatballs, Latex Gloves, And A Franchise Defenseman: Inside The Wild's Blockbuster Trade For Quinn Hughes A kitchen, meatballs, and latex gloves. That's where the Wild's blockbuster move for franchise defenseman Quinn Hughes ended. The window is now open.\n\nThe superstar defenseman was well aware that other teams were interested in him and sent offers. He was also aware that interest often stops once the real price becomes clear. Guerin didn’t hesitate. He committed and made the deal.\n\nThat matters to players and especially to the elite ones.\n\nHughes didn’t frame the trade purely in transactional terms. He framed it as belief and revealed how much weight he places on how organizations operate behind the scenes.\n\nFor Hughes, this wasn’t just about joining a good roster. It was about joining leadership he respected.\n\n“I just got here, but a big reason why is obviously because I thought they’re a tremendous group, just playing them over the years. Hard to play against, really hard to play against, but got elite skill as well. Obviously, knowing that I was going to be able to play with Faber, Spurgeon, too, two elite players and Brodin and some other guys that are great back there, Bogo. But yeah to play with those guys I knew would be pretty good for me, too.”\n\nIt goes beyond the players though. Everyone knows how close this group of guys are. The core here is tight and all elite. When talking about Matt Boldy, Faber, Kaprizov and so on. Now adding Hughes to the core is dangerous.\n\nAnd he respects the crap out of Guerin for trading the players he did to acquire the star.\n\nSo much so that even the rumors of him wanting to play with his brother in New Jersey or him wanting to be back home in Michigan and signing with Detroit, didn't even sound like they were serious when Hughes talked.\n\nSo how open-minded is he about signing long-term in Minnesota?\n\n“Extremely open-minded. They got an amazing core,\" he said. \"I’ve only been here four hours but getting to know some of the guys and how energetic and positive guys are and then Minnesota being so close to Michigan and just the State of Hockey and the passion here. Just seeing how the fans reacted to me as well in warmups.\"\n\nNothing about Hughes’ first night in Minnesota felt temporary. From the roar during warmups to the trust shown by the front office, the Wild didn’t just acquire a superstar, they made a statement. Hughes hasn’t been here long enough to make promises, but he’s been here long enough to notice who believed in him, who valued him, and what it feels like to be wanted. For Minnesota, that impression may end up mattering just as much as the trade itself, the money itself or any other factor you want to put into it.\n\n\"I got a lot of time for Billy for quote unquote sacking up and making the deal like he did and just how he valued me. There are other teams that probably could have thrown in certain packages like that, too, but at the end of the day they didn’t want to do that or they didn’t want to trade two or three assets from their team. Billy did, so I’ll remember that and that means a lot to me that Billy did that.”\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "With the MLB Winter Meetings heading up all the headlines for the previous week-plus, there has been very little other San Diego Padres news. The rumors, on the other hand, have been running rampant.\n\nIt started with many prominent baseball writers opining that there is no way for the Padres to survive their change of ownership and budget cuts without trading Fernando Tatis Jr. President of baseball operations A.J. Preller did his best to dispel those rumors during his media appearance at the meetings by stating that Tatis was staying put.\n\nThe other prevailing rumor was that the Padres would be converting either Mason Miller or Adrian Morejon from the bullpen to the starting rotation. This was at least a credible rumor as Preller had acknowledged it was being considered in previous statements. He stated on Day 1 of the meetings that idea was largely dismissed.\n\nThe next rumor floated was that members of the bullpen, Miller and Morejon included, are on the trading block in order to bring back starting pitching.\n\nPreller stated that was not part of the plan, as the bullpen is a strength and he was not interested in diluting that advantage.\n\nThe next subject of the rumor mill was Jake Cronenworth, who is considered to be sought after by teams who need a defensively-talented and versatile infielder who is a valuable offensive player.\n\nThe Cronenworth rumor seems to occur every offseason since he was signed to an extension that gives him $12 million annually through 2030. Up ‘til now, Cronenworth continues to be a Padre and is considered a leader on the team.\n\nThe latest rumors involve Miller, Morejon, Jeremiah Estrada, Nick Pivetta and Ramón Laureano all coveted by the New York Mets, and the Padres are actively in discussions to acquire both pitchers and position players from the Mets’ young prospects and major leaguers (mlbtraderumors).\n\nThe Padres seem to have a complete coaching staff now, though the announcements have not been made officially. Many of the new coaches have connections to new manager Craig Stammen.\n\nAfter retaining bench coach Brian Esposito, pitching coach Ruben Niebla, bullpen coach Ben Fritz, first base coach Dave Macias and the two assistant hitting coaches, the Padres named a second bench coach in Randy Knorr. Mike McCoy and Pat O’Sullivan remain as assistant hitting coaches with new hitting coach Steven Souza.\n\nSouza was a special assistant with the Tampa Bay Rays, was a power hitter as a player and seems to reflect the organization shifting its offensive focus to more aggression. Niebla was given a new title as assistant manager as well as pitching coach.\n\nRyan Goins, hired as an infield coach, was an infield specialist and was on Ron Washington’s staff with the Los Angeles Angels before Washington left due to illness. He was named bench coach after the previous bench coach was named interim manager. Goins was considered a glove-first player as a major leaguer.\n\nKevin Plawecki has been with the Padres as a catching coach in the minor leagues and will move into that role with the major league team. He was a catcher in both the minor leagues with the Padres and a back up catcher with the Mets and Boston Red Sox. He retired after the 2024 season and assumed a coaching role with the Padres.\n\nBob Henley, who spent almost his entire baseball career with the Montreal Expos/Washington Nationals, has been hired as the new third base coach. He first had the role in 2014-2021 with the Nationals and then went into a player development role. Stammen pitched with the Nationals from 2009-2015 so there is significant familiarity between them.\n\nRHP Misael Tamarez, who was a free agent after the 2025 season, re-signed with the organization on Dec. 4. RHP Evan Fitterer also signed a minor league contract as a free agent on Dec. 8.\n\nFormer Padres closer Suarez joined former starter Dylan Cease in signing a free agent contract and earning a big payday. Suarez is committed to the Atlanta Braves for three years and $45 million in a setup/ backup closer role.\n\nPadres to the World Baseball Classic\n\nFernando Tatis Jr. and Manny Machado will be managed by Albert Pujols with the Dominican Republic team. Shortstop Xander Bogaerts will play for the Netherlands team as a native of Aruba. There is a report that Nick Pivetta is considering committing to the Canadian team.\n\nLuis Campusano finishes in winter ball\n\nA.J. Preller stated at the winter meetings that Campusano has finished his time with Tigers de Licey in the Dominican Winter League. He finished with 19 games played and 50 at-bats. His batting line was .200/.293/.340 with a .633 OPS. He had two homers and eight RBI.\n\nPreller has had multiple questions asked regarding Campusano’s future with the team. He will be given another opportunity this spring to show that he belongs on the major league roster. If he is not successful there are no more options for him to be sent to the minors. The options will be to trade him or try to pass him through waivers in order to be optioned.",

    "fullText": "Frankie de la Noche was different from Gus Marlowe and Professor Saber in that he only technically appeared once this season—though his creation was preceded by a detective article that served as a proof of concept. That first noir piece was also the first time I stepped outside my usual voice and wrote in an entirely different style.\n\nUp to that point, my writing had followed a pretty clear progression. My first fan post was a classic Crescibene smackdown of ESPN’s Watchability Index—pure fire, pure indignation, very much in the same voice as my anti-corruption writing on Medium. The next two articles were more traditional baseball analysis, focused on the player pipeline and the GM pipeline within the Cleveland organization. Those pieces were still written in my voice, but structurally they were recognizable as standard sports analysis.\n\nThe detective article broke from all of that. It wasn’t just a tonal shift; it was a structural one. And as far as I’ve been able to tell, no one else is doing sports journalism quite like this.\n\nEarly in the season, after my first few fan posts, I wrote a one-off detective noir piece that explored the Guardians roster as a mystery. At that point, there was no Frankie de la Noche. What I was really doing was experimenting with style—seeing if I could write a roster analysis in a completely different way. Instead of presenting information directly, I treated the roster like a case file. It was a risk, but it worked.\n\nThe response to that article made it clear that style itself could carry meaning, and that a strong narrative voice could make familiar information feel fresh again. At the time, I didn’t know I was laying the groundwork for a recurring character. I just knew it was a style I wanted to return to later.\n\nOnce Gus Marlowe had established himself as a recurring presence, I realized I needed other recurring characters to join him. That’s when the idea of a detective character took shape—a way to return to the noir style, but this time with a defined voice behind it rather than just an experiment in form.\n\nThat’s when Frankie de la Noche was born.\n\nFrankie is the dramatized version of my internal dialogue when I’m trying to make sense of roster construction, call-ups, logjams, and front-office decisions that don’t quite add up. In Frankie’s first true appearance, I introduced him in his office at Progressive Field—a single light glowing beneath a door on the fourth floor, late at night, rain tapping against the windows. It was a classic noir setting, and a deliberate callback to the original detective article. Noir characters are inseparable from their environments, and I wanted readers to feel like they were stepping into Frankie’s space in an immersive way.\n\nThat said, Frankie is still very much a character in formation. The setting is established. The tone is established. The function is established. But his mannerisms, rhythms, and specific quirks are still emerging. Characters like this aren’t built all at once; they reveal themselves through repetition.\n\nThat was something Gus taught me over the course of the season. His abrupt entrances, clipped phrasing, and chaotic exits weren’t planned in advance—they were discovered over time. They came from seeing him in different situations and letting consistency form naturally. Frankie is now going through that same process of discovery.\n\nFrankie de la Noche will certainly be back as there will be no shortage of roster mysteries next season. I already know there are other settings where Frankie belongs—and yes, there will absolutely be a late-night encounter under a bridge in the Flats. Maybe Frankie has an informant. Maybe someone slips him an inside scoop.\n\nThe goal going forward is the same one I had with Gus: to make Frankie feel immediately recognizable. I want readers to know his voice the moment he starts talking. When Frankie shows up, it should feel like running into someone you’ve met before.\n\nIn review, Frankie de la Noche this season was more of an exploration than a finished product. He emerged out of a stylistic experiment, found a purpose once the cast of characters began to take shape, and made his first real appearance with more potential than polish. And that’s fine. That’s how characters should start. Where it goes from here… only Frankie knows.\n\nSo what do you think? Did the noir pieces work for you? Did Frankie feel like someone worth revisiting? And when the next mystery comes along, would you like to see him take another case?\n\nLet me know your thoughts in the comments.",

    "description": "The NY Giants hold the No.1 pick after their eighth consecutive loss.",
    "fullText": "The New York Giants suffered a frustrating 29-21 loss to the Washington Commanders on Sunday as they returned from their bye week. As a result, the Giants continued to hold the No.1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThere were some flashes, like Abdul Carter having a breakout game, big plays from tight ends Daniel Bellinger and Theo Johnson, DB Dru Phillips, and RB Tyrone Tracy. But there were simply too many miscues and missed opportunities to overcome with late magic. But ultimately it was too little, too late for the Giants and their frantic comeback fell short.\n\nThe loss also highlighted the shortcomings of the Giants’ roster, as the receivers consistently failed to get open, once again forcing Jaxson Dart to hold the ball or take a big hit when scrambling, and struggled to hang onto the ball when they did find separation. This was also (probably) Jermaine Eluemunor’s worst game of the season, as he struggled against veteran pass rusher Von Miller, and the Giants struggled to consistently move the ball in short-yardage situations on the ground.\n\nThe Giants’ eighth-consecutive loss comes one day after Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza won the Heisman Trophy.\n\nThat brings us to the upside of the loss for the Giants: there are a number of quarterback-needy teams in the Top 10 of the draft, and it’s possible that Mendoza will be the only highly-regarded quarterback to come out this year. That could make the first overall pick highly valuable if teams like the New York Jets, Las Vegas Raiders, Cleveland Browns, and New Orleans Saints are all vying for the top quarterback prospect.\n\nNobody wants to see the Giants lose, but trading the first overall pick could net valuable assets to fill multiple holes in the first two or three rounds. The Giants could use a highly-drafted receiver as well as a long-term answer at right tackle. Likewise, the Giants need a long-term answer at right guard and an infusion of youth and athleticism at linebacker.\n\nMost early mock drafts have the Giants drafting a wide receiver or an offensive tackle with their first pick. A sizeable haul of picks could allow them to address both positions with high picks, as well as add one of the talented linebackers or defensive backs in this class.\n\nIt remains to be seen who will make that pick, but the Giants could have a tremendous amount of capital to go with a young roster.\n\nThe Giants’ road to the first overall pick is a tight one. They share a 2-12 record with the Tennessee Titans and Las Vegas Raiders (who they play in two weeks). The Jets, Browns, and Arizona Cardinals are also each a game out of the first pick at 3-11, though the Saints managed to beat the Carolina Panthers and improve to 4-10 on the season.\n\nNew York still has games against the Minnesota Vikings, the afore-mentioned Raiders, and the Dallas Cowboys to end the season. They remain a team that can compete with any in the NFL, as well as lose to any in the NFL, so no outcome between 1st and 10th overall is out of the question.",

    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) — The Detroit Lions know what it takes to compete with the best in the loaded NFC after a 41-34 loss to the conference-leading Los Angeles Rams on Sunday.\n\nBut with three games and zero margin for error remaining to make the playoffs, the Lions are running out of time to be able to put those lessons to use.\n\n“You know what it is. And we’re not there right now,” Lions coach Dan Campbell said. “Doesn’t know we can’t be, but now we know what it looks like, and you got to get better. We got to get better. We got to move on. Can’t sulk about it. Can’t felly sorry for ourselves. We make the corrections, and we move on.”\n\nThe Lions (8-6) haven’t made the postseason in three consecutive campaigns since 1993-95, and understood coming into the weekend that even winning out might not be enough to get a playoff berth and end that streak.\n\nThey came out with a first half worthy of the Super Bowl aspirations they entered the season with, taking a 24-14 lead with 30 seconds remaining behind a dynamic passing attack from quarterback Jared Goff to wide receivers Amon-Ra St. Brown and Jameson Williams, plus a jaw-dropping interception by edge rusher Aidan Hutchinson on a tight end screen and returning it 58 yards.\n\n“Aidan made a great play,” Los Angeles quarterback Matthew Stafford said. “Looked like he was the primary receiver on the damn play. Made me look silly in space.”\n\nBut the Rams (11-3) snatched a field goal to end the second quarter, and the Lions could not regain momentum after the break, going three-and-out on both possessions in the third quarter while the defense gave up 17 points.\n\nGoff pointed to ineffectiveness on first down in the second half, forcing the offensive line into situations where Los Angeles could turn to its powerful pass rush. Campbell essentially agreed, noting an overall inability to run the ball as Detroit had two carries for 11 yards in the third quarter, plus a holding penalty which negated a first down and left the offense facing third-and-long.\n\n“But, the bottom line is, we weren’t able to convert, and so then we strung the defense out, and then all of a sudden it flips,” Campbell said. “You’re up 10, you’re down 10, and that was a rough quarter for us.”\n\nThe Lions finished with just 70 yards rushing on 20 carries, having failed to win any of their five games this season when totaling less than 100 yards on the ground.\n\nGoff went 25 of 41 for 338 yards and three touchdowns, finding St. Brown 13 times for 164 yards and two scores and Williams seven times for 134 yards and a score, though their overall effectiveness dropped off in the second half.\n\nDetroit needs to win its final three games — against Pittsburgh, at Minnesota on a short week, and at Chicago — and get help to have a shot at the playoffs\n\nGoff expressed belief the Lions can still put a streak together, even after alternating wins and losses for the past 10 games.\n\n“We’re resilient,” Goff said. “I hope I can give you a really good answer in a couple weeks. But we’re resilient. We really are, and I expect us to bounce back from this, and we still have plenty of stuff in front of us.”\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "description": "We discuss the most important golf figures of the last 12 months, the drama of PGA Tour Q-School, an insane golf record and more.",
    "fullText": "Check in every week for the unfiltered opinions of our writers and editors as they break down the hottest topics in the sport, and join the conversation by tweeting us at @golf_com. This week, we discuss the most important golf figures of the last 12 months, the drama of PGA Tour Q-School and more.\n\nAs we count down the final days of 2025, let’s take a quick moment to reflect on the year that was. Who were the most important golf figures of 2025?\n\nJack Hirsh, associate equipment editor (@JR_HIRSHey): Important? I think it's got to be new PGA Tour CEO Brian Rolapp and new LPGA commissioner Craig Kessler. Both have taken over legacy properties badly in need of fresh ideas and new perspective. Already we're hearing talks of massive changes for the PGA Tour schedule as soon as 2027. Whether you like them or not, the Tour is clearly looking for something that will put its LIV Golf problem to bed. With Kessler and the LPGA, a new TV deal seems like it could be the spark to get the Tour to ride this new wave of interest in women's sports around the world. There are certainly more important names in the golf world right now, but none will have more pressure to achieve their goals in 2026 than these two.\n\nZephyr Melton, associate game-improvement editor (@zephyrmelton): Jack laid it out well, but I'll go ahead and give Tiger Woods his obligatory mention. The popularity of the sport still ebbs and flows with Tiger - as evidenced by the heaps of coverage when he so much as posts a swing video. His competitive career may be behind him, but his influence on the game remains unmatched.\n\nJosh Sens, senior writer (@JoshSens): Good answers above. To them, I'd add Rory McIlroy for providing the most compelling entertainment of the year at both the Masters and the Ryder Cup. And Tommy Fleetwood for best feel-good story. But that's more about rooting interest than importance. Beyond those guys, some non-traditional golf figures come to mind, especially at a time when the game is stretching increasingly beyond its old boundaries. Caitlin Clark getting into golf. LeBron James going viral with every swing posted online. And though I'd rather get a root canal than watch a bunch of \"influencers\" knock it around, clearly people are interested, as we saw with the success of the Internet Invitational. Welcome to the future, for better or worse.\n\nAnd who - not mentioned above - might we be talking about in this space a year from now as a key figure of 2026?\n\nHirsh: I think it will be someone like Jon Rahm. His prominence in the game has seemed to diminish since his move to LIV, but he’s still played pretty well and I think will start making more of an impact in majors. He still hasn’t won one since the 2023 Masters.\n\nMelton: How bout Brooks Koepka? Speaking of LIV, he's long been rumored to want out of his LIV deal in order to get back to the PGA Tour. Could 2026 be the year we see a LIV star defect back to the Tour? If it is, BK is likely the first domino to fall.\n\nSens: Bryson. His impact shows no sign of slowing.\n\nFive players earned Tour cards for 2026 via PGA Tour Q-School Sunday at TPC Sawgrass. Which outcome - the good or bad - stuck out to you the most?\n\nHirsh: Sad to see one of the Tour's great people, Camilo Villegas, come up one shot short of a playoff to keep full playing status on the Tour. He'll still be around as a former winner, but I wouldn't be surprised if former winners hanging onto fringe status is exactly what shrinking the number of exempt players from 125 to 100 is targeting.\n\nMelton: Alejandro Tosti is headed back to the Tour - and the content gods thank him.\n\nSens: Villegas' final missed shorty on 18 was painful. But it was touching to see him stick around to celebrate with his friend and countryman Marcelo Rozo. Personally, I was rooting for Spencer Levin, who has been around the block and then some and just didn't have his best stuff today.\n\nSpeaking of the Tour’s aforementioned card changes, are five cards from Q-School enough? Too little? And is Q-School still a key part of the Tour’s construction?\n\nHirsh: We absolutely need Q-School, especially now that Monday Qs are gone. I think five is a good number, especially with the Korn Ferry Tour shrinking to 20 cards. I also like the hard five instead of the ties, because a playoff, like we got this year, for the last PGA Tour card of the season is pretty awesome. But I'd also like to use this space to mention we still need Monday Qs.\n\nMelton: I'd like to see Q-School give even more cards. We always talk about \"life-changing\" weeks in pro golf, but there's no tournament where that's more true than the Final Stage of Q-School. The drama of it is unlike anything else in the sport, and that makes it one of the coolest weeks of the year.\n\nSens: Five feels about right. And eliminating ties only adds to the excitement. Nothing like a sudden-death playoff to cap a four-day stress test.\n\nOur Josh Sens recently wrote about a golfer who just broke a world record for most courses played in a year. What’s your number? And if you could pick one course you have already played to tee it up on for the rest of your life, which is it?\n\nHirsh: First of all, that's a level of golf sicko-ness of which I'm not familiar. Bravo! I have no idea what the most courses I've ever played is. Probably around 20. I'm sure Zephyr has played some ungodly number of courses the last couple years. If I had to pick one course though, it would probably be Royal Dornoch. Links golf is undefeated.\n\nMelton: I wish I played half as much golf as my co-workers think I play. I only logged 40 rounds in 2025! As for the most courses, it's likely in the range of 30 or so. When you don't belong to a club, variety is the name of the game. As for one course for the rest of my life? Give me Pasatiempo. Elite course. Elite vibe. Elite logo.\n\nSens: I'd only be guessing at an annual number. Probably 50? That was a year in my 20s when I waited tables at night and would sneak out to the muni pre-weekday shifts. As for a single course, tough question. In the absence of a perfect answer: Cruden Bay. I don't think I've ever had more fun on a course.\n\nThe post Tour Confidential: The most important golf figures of 2025 appeared first on Golf.",

    "fullText": "The semifinal stage is set for No. 1 seed Kentucky volleyball, as the Wildcats prepare to take on No. 3 seed Wisconsin in the NCAA Final Four on Thursday, Dec. 18, at 9:00 PM ET inside the T-Mobile Center in Kansas City.\n\nKentucky has been dominant throughout the NCAA Tournament, including a 3–0 sweep of Wofford, a sweep against Cal Poly in the Sweet 16, and a sweep over Creighton in the Elite Eight. Their only dropped set came in the Round of 32 against UCLA. Outside of that brief hiccup, Kentucky has controlled matches from start to finish and remains undefeated at home this season.\n\nWisconsin arrives in Kansas City after a statement win over No. 1 Texas in the Elite Eight. The Badgers earned a measure of revenge against the Longhorns, who handed Wisconsin one of its four losses during the regular season. Kentucky accounted for Texas’ other two defeats, beating the Longhorns in both the regular season and the SEC Tournament championship.\n\nThursday’s matchup also carries historical weight for Big Blue Nation. Wisconsin was the team that ended Kentucky men’s basketball’s perfect 38–0 season in the 2015 Final Four, denying the Wildcats an undefeated national title.\n\nNow, Kentucky volleyball has an opportunity to write a different ending against the Badgers on the sport’s biggest stage.\n\nIf the Wildcats advance, they’ll face the winner of the other national semifinal matchup, which sees No. 1 seed Pittsburgh, who actually handed Kentucky one of its regular-season losses, take on No. 3 seed Texas A&M, whom the Cats defeated in College Station.\n\nWith a spot in the national championship match on the line, the Wildcats will look to continue their dominant run and settle an old score. The national championship game is Sunday, Dec. 21, on ABC at 3:30 PM ET.\n\nThe semifinal is set. \n\nvs. Wisconsin on Thursday, 9:00 p.m. ET at T-Mobile Center in Kansas City😼\n\nTickets: https://t.co/sv5Hlwlsn1#WeAreUK x #BBN pic.twitter.com/BxN8vh57w8\n\n— Kentucky Volleyball (@KentuckyVB) December 15, 2025",

    "fullText": "Cowboys vs. Vikings live score, updates, highlights from NFL 'Sunday Night Football' game originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhere to watch the NFL game tonight\n\nEntering the final quarter of the NFL season, it’s officially do-or-die for the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nSitting at a precarious 6-6-1 after a damaging Week 14 loss to the Detroit Lions, the Cowboys are clinging to life in the NFC playoff picture. The road to the NFC East crown has become a steep uphill climb, with the division-leading Philadelphia Eagles holding a significant advantage at 8-5. For Dallas, the margin for error has evaporated; it can no longer afford the inconsistent performances that have defined its season.\n\nWith the NFC wild-card race stacked — featuring contenders like the Lions, Panthers and Buccaneers — the Cowboys need a near-perfect run to separate themselves. Their remaining schedule features three of four games against NFC opponents with playoff implications. The crucible begins immediately in Week 15 with a pivotal home Sunday Night Football clash against the Minnesota Vikings (5-8).\n\nWhile Minnesota will almost certainly miss the playoffs, it provides a tough matchup for Dallas. The Vikings' defense is coming off a game where it shut out the Commanders, forcing three turnovers and giving up just over 200 yards in a 31-0 win. Offensively, while J.J. McCarthy has had his struggles in his first year as a starter, the Vikings still have plenty of weapons to boats, including a top wide receiver duo in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison; with these two, CeeDee Lamb and George Pickens, the receiving talent is off the charts.\n\nDallas needs a home primetime win to keep its playoff aspirations alive, while Minnesota is looking to build on the momentum it generated last week.\n\nFollow along for all the action from AT&T Stadium.\n\nSTREAM: Watch Vikings vs. Cowboys LIVE with Peacock\n\nNFL HQ:Live NFL scores | Updated NFL standings | Full NFL schedule\n\n10:42 p.m.: Williams is back with two big carries.

It was noted that the injury occurred on the final kickoff to end the first half.\n\nLuke Schoonmaker (really) had an amazing catch that put the Cowboys at the Minnesota 11-yard line.

It was a Christmas miracle.\n\nDallas tried to get KaVontae Turpin involved on offense on the next possession, a curious move given that George Pickens had not really had many moments at this point in the game. But hey, whatever.\n\nThings stalled out yet again and Brandon Aubrey delivered once more.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 41-yard field goal)\n\nRight off the bat the Vikings were across midfield. Playing with your food has consequences.\n\nNot long after that the Vikings were up against the goal line. Keep in mind before you reed the next sentence that the previous Cowboys four possessions ended with a field goal kick (they missed one obviously).\n\nBoom. Vikings touchdown. The lead changed hands.\n\nC.J. Ham is in for the go-ahead touchdown\n\nMINvsDAL on NBC\nStream on @NFLPlus + Peacock pic.twitter.com/Mr3FNwwnmg\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 23, VIKINGS 24 (C.J. Ham touchdown)\n\nTwo plays into the second quarter… the Cowboys had a touchdown once more. This one was courtesy of Malik Davis who was (obviously) in for Javonte Williams.\n\nMALIK DAVIS TD! pic.twitter.com/C3fbKMycuX\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 7 (Malik Davis touchdown)\n\nThe Vikings made sure to show up for the next drive, though. They moved thoroughly down the field and kept getting in their own way to keep themselves from scoring a touchdown. They wound up with a short situation right on the goal line and then J.J. McCarthy pulled the Peyton Manning bootleg.\n\nEmbarrassing pic.twitter.com/AJugDLlRaS\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 14 (J.J. McCarthy touchdown)\n\nThe game was tied at this point which felt weird because it had for so long felt like Dallas was in control. The Cowboys nevertheless began moving once more and ultimately stalled out in field goal range. Brandon Aubrey, though.\n\nUnfortunately Aubrey pushed his 51-yard attempt wide to the right which kept things tied and gave the Vikings solid field position to work with.\n\nMinnesota was able to scrap out a field goal which gave them their first lead of the night. It set Dallas up with a chance to score and 1:48 to do so. Given that Dallas deferred to start the game the drive also offered a potential double-dip opportunity.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 14, VIKINGS 17 (Will Reichard 29-yard field goal)\n\nThe Cowboys were able to work quickly to get in field goal range themselves. Given Aubrey’s recent miss there was a little bit of breath holding for the first time in a while with him.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 17, VIKINGS 17 (Brandon Aubrey 17-yard field goal)\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys won the toss and deferred which put the defense on the field first. Given that there were reports about how Logan Wilson was set to start at linebacker… it was exciting to say the least.\n\nIt took two plays for things to get legitimately exciting. Donovan Wilson got pressure in J.J. McCarthy’s face and wisely put his hand up to block a pass. That errant ball landed in the expectant arms of Quinnen Williams to give the Cowboys a turnover and more importantly… the ball!\n\nQUINNEN WILLIAMS INT! pic.twitter.com/ImWT83EQCu\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAfter a couple of plays the Cowboys appeared to stall out and had to settle for a Brandon Aubrey field goal. They didn’t, though! They ran a fake! And got it!\n\nBRANDON AUBREY WITH THE WHEELS pic.twitter.com/GGGBuE5B1i\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nAmazingly the Cowboys got down to another fourth down and went for it yet again, although this time conventionally by way of a Javonte Williams run.\n\nAfter getting it Javonte was in the end zone one play later.\n\nJAVONTE TD! pic.twitter.com/3ObBLpnpmW\n\n— Blogging The Boys (@BloggingTheBoys) December 15, 2025\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 0 (Javonte Williams touchdown)\n\nThe Cowboys defense went to work and while they were not able to generate a turnover they did force a punt. Dante Fowler was a particular point of pride on the possession in question and helped stop Aaron Jones.\n\nUnfortunately KaVontae Turpin let a punt go that he maybe should have fielded. The bounce really worked against Dallas and put them just about on their own goal line.\n\nMalik Davis was in at running back for the possession as it was reported that Javonte Williams was dealing with a shoulder injury. Ultimately the Cowboys wound up punting after a three and out as they did not want to get too cute.\n\nIt took two plays once more for Minnesota to have a moment. On the first one of them Aaron Jones had a massive gain and a penalty added to it to make matters worse. A few seconds later J.J. McCarthy hit Jalen Nailor for a game-tying touchdown.\n\nSCORE: COWBOYS 7, VIKINGS 7 (J.J. McCathy to Jalen Nailor touchdown)\n\nWhen the Cowboys took over it was noted by the NBC broadcast that Javonte Williams was questionable to return with a shoulder injury so that corroborated everything to date.\n\nDak Prescott hit CeeDee Lamb for a huge gain and the Cowboys were in striking distance as the opening quarter came to a close. To help matters a facemask penalty really put Dallas close to another score.",

    "fullText": "SEATTLE (AP) — Noah Ostlund, Tage Thompson and Zach Benson all scored and the Buffalo Sabres beat the Seattle Kraken 3-1 on Sunday for their third straight win.\n\nAlex Tuch had two assists and Alex Lyon made 23 saves for the Sabres.\n\nChandler Stephenson scored for Seattle, and Joey Daccord stopped 20 shots. The Kraken have lost eight of their last nine games (1-7-1).\n\nOstlund opened the scoring on a 2-on-1 alongside Josh Norris with 2:51 to go in the first period. Ryker Evans failed to intercept two passes between the Sabres skaters.\n\nNot long after a successful penalty kill by the Sabres, Thompson doubled Buffalo’s lead with 9:52 left in the second. Payton Krebs set him up for the shot with a short pass close to the net, as the two were left unguarded by Seattle. It was Thompson’s 16th goal of the season.\n\nStephenson put the Kraken on the board with 7:36 left in the middle period. The goal came 6 seconds into Seattle’s second power play of the night.\n\nBenson added an empty-net goal with 46 seconds left.\n\nDespite the recent win streak, Sabres general manager Kevyn Adams entered this season on the hot seat and there are concerns owner Terry Pegula could shake up his front office sometime this week. Adams is in his sixth season as GM and the Sabres are once again near the bottom of the standings and already in jeopardy of extending their NHL record playoff drought to a 15th season.\n\nSabres: Host Philadelphia on Thursday night.\n\nKraken: Host Colorado on Tuesday night.\n\nAP NHL: https://www.apnews.com/hub/NHL",

    "description": "Following the Colts' Week 15 loss to Seattle, here are three quick takeaways from what took place with Phillip Rivers at quarterback.",
    "fullText": "The Indianapolis Colts came up short in Week 15 against Seattle. A field goal in the final seconds would secure the win for the Seahawks.\n\nWith the dust having settled on Sunday's game, let's take a look back at what took place with the three things we learned from the Colts' performance.\n\nThis was far from a flashy performance, but Rivers delivered what the Colts needed -- stability at quarterback. He completed 18-of-27 passes for 120 yards with a touchdown and an interception.\n\nRivers helped the Colts' offense sustain drives and kept the ball out of harm's way until the very end.\n\nIndianapolis leaned into the running game to keep Rivers and the offense ahead of the sticks and out of long down-and-distance situations, and they relied on the qick passing game as well.\n\nOn both sides of the ball, the Colts fought hard in this game and this team needed some juice after Daniel Jones exited last week's game -- which Rivers provided.\n\nThe Seattle offense entered this game as one of the most productive in football, both in points and in yards, especially through the air. But the Colts were able to contain the Seahawks for much of the game.\n\nFor one, Seattle didn't score a single touchdown in this game. The Colts also did well getting off the field, holding Seattle to just two third-down conversions. The Seahawks offense also averaged a modest 5.3 yards per play.\n\nThe Colts did this while down their top two cornerbacks and without DeForest Buckner.\n\nUltimately, with the game close late, Seattle's more talented offense prevailed. But as the Colts' offense tried to find its footing in this game, the defense kept things close.\n\nAll of that sounds good -- and those are positives -- but the reality is the Colts also lost, and their playoff hopes took another hit.\n\nThe Colts are now 8-6 on the season. With Jacksonville winning on Sunday, Indianapolis is now two games back of the AFC South lead. Houston's win helped them improve to 9-5.\n\nThe Colts now trail the Texans by a game for the AFC's final wildcard spot and are two games back of the 10-4 Chargers and Bills.\n\nThe Colts do play the Texans once more, but also have to face the 10-win 49ers and the 10-win Jaguars.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Colts Wire: Colts lose to Seahawks: 3 takeaways from performance",

    "description": "The San Francisco 49ers took on the Tennessee Titans on Sunday and earned a win, but there were a few 49ers who didn't have their best games.",
    "fullText": "After a week off, the San Francisco 49ers welcomed the Tennessee Titans to Levi's Stadium for a Week 15 battle, and Kyle Shanahan's squad earned a _ victory, moving them to 10-4 on the season.\n\nWhile San Francisco secured the win, they played far from their best game, and there are quite a few 49ers who will probably want to move on quickly.\n\nHere are some of San Francisco's worst performers from Sunday's win.\n\nBurford has jumped in as the starting left guard after Ben Bartch suffered a season-ending injury and Connor Colby was benched. On Sunday, he allowed the pressure that resulted in Brock Purdy's strip sack. He was also called for a false start on San Francisco's second-to-last possession.\n\nTennessee doesn't boast the best passing game in the league, but they have a decent ground attack. Robert Saleh's unit should've been keyed in on stopping Tony Pollard and Tyjae Spears, but the duo combined for 138 yards and a score (Pollard's) on 8.1 yards per attempt. Injuries have decimated San Francisco's defensive front, but they still should be better than that.\n\nRobinson hasn't done much the last couple of weeks, and that streak continued in Week 15, as he ran for just 21 yards on an abysmal 2.3 yards per carry. Christian McCaffrey wasn't efficient either (rushing for 73 yards on 3.3 yards per carry), but he at least found the end zone.\n\nSimmons was wide open in the back of the end zone to catch the second touchdown of his career. That's inexcusable. Luke Gifford was the player closest to Simmons, so he should get the most blame, but no one should be happy after that play.\n\nMore 49ers: Kyle Shanahan says 2025 49ers aren't the team he's been most proud of\n\nThis article originally appeared on Niners Wire: Worst performances from 49ers' unsatisfying win vs. Titans in Week 15",

    "fullText": "Want to call someone a quick-thinker? The easiest cliché for doing so is calling her a computer – in fact, “computers” was the literal job title of the “Hidden Figures” mathematicians who drove the success of early NASA.\n\nBut while modern electronic computers are far faster than even those mathematical geniuses were with paper, pencils, and slide rules, there’s another type of computing that leaves it eating space dust – optical computing, as fast as the speed of light because instead of using electrons, it uses light itself.\n\nThe need for faster computing isn’t just to satisfy impatient consumers screaming to stream movies while video-chatting, VR gaming, and 3D printing. It’s to handle the Big-Bang-level of data expansion of the modern digital world. The humble graphics processing units (GPUs) in standard computers simply can’t scale or work quickly enough to meet such massive overflow. Even worse, as The Smithsonian Magazine and Sustainability Magazine report, AI data centers filled with GPUs are consuming massive amounts of electricity (mostly from nonrenewable sources) and water (often in arid regions).\n\nEnter Yufeng Zhang (Photonics Group at Aalto University’s Department of Electronics and Nanoengineering) and Xiaobing Liu (Chinese Academy of Sciences, Changchun). In their Nature Photonics paper “Direct tensor processing with coherent light,” lead author Zhang and colleagues reveal their computational method employing a single propagation of light, hence what is known as \"single-shot tensor computing at light speed in a parallel optical matrix–matrix multiplication\" (POMMM).\n\nThat kind of breakthrough brings artificial general intelligence one major step closer.\n\n“Our method performs the same kinds of operations that today’s GPUs handle,” says Zhang, such as “convolutions and attention layers, but does them all at the speed of light.” Instead of standard binary coding information utilizing electronic circuits using signals of ones and zeros, the researchers use the amplitude and phase of light waves to store, process, and communicate data. Doing so not only saves energy, but provides a gigantic expansion of bandwidth and processing speed – in fact, it performs many of its processes simultaneously.\n\nThe combined interactions of light fields naturally produce mathematical operations including tensor multiplications. Tensor processing organizes data into multi-dimensional arrays (think of a 2D array as a single shelf in a filing cabinet, and a 3D array as a filing cabinet with several shelves stacked vertically) called data tensors. Tensor processing is everywhere in leading-edge technology, particularly in data analytics and artificial intelligence, including natural language processing and image recognition. It’s at the heart of deep learning algorithms.\n\nHowever, current optical methods fare poorly with tensor-based tasks, rendering them inefficient for neural networks and other highly complex applications. That’s where the Aalto method offers a major leap forward, by employing multiple wavelengths of light which can handle even extremely demanding tensor operations.\n\nTo explain the difference between electronic and his team’s optical computation, Zhang uses an analogy of package-sorting to explain the difference between electronic and optical computation.\n\n“Imagine you’re a customs officer who must inspect every parcel through multiple machines with different functions and then sort them into the right bins,” says Zhang. “Normally, you’d process each parcel one by one. Our optical computing method merges all parcels and all machines together [by creating] multiple ‘optical hooks’ that connect each input to its correct output. With just one operation, one pass of light, all inspections and sorting happen instantly and in parallel.”\n\nTensor parallel (also called tensor model parallel or TP) processing is an execution strategy for deep learning that deploys multiple devices to address components of the same model, allowing them to compute larger models more quickly. Put another way, many minds make lighter work. Or, in this case, speed-of-light work.\n\nAccording to Zhipei Sun, leader of Aalto University’s Photonics Group, the new method can work on nearly any optical platform, and his team plans “to integrate this computational framework directly onto photonic chips, enabling light-based processors to perform complex AI tasks with extremely low power consumption.”\n\nIf the method works, they expect to deploy it for integration with existing hardware and major platforms within five years. Doing so “will create a new generation of optical computing systems, significantly accelerating complex AI tasks across a myriad of fields.”",

    "description": "Move marks big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as safeguard against Russian attacks",
    "fullText": "Move marks big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as safeguard against Russian attacks\n\nVolodymyr Zelenskyy has offered to drop Ukraine’s aspirations to join the Nato military alliance, as he held five hours of talks with US envoys in Berlin on Sunday to end the war with Russia.\n\nDonald Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff said “a lot of progress was made” as he and the US president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, met Zelenskyy in the latest push to end Europe’s bloodiest conflict since the second world war – though full details were not divulged.\n\nDmytro Lytvyn, an adviser to the Ukrainian president, said Zelenskyy would comment further when the talks conclude on Monday. He added that officials are now considering the draft documents.\n\nBefore the talks, Zelenskyy had offered to drop Ukraine’s goal to join Nato in exchange for western security guarantees.\n\nThe move marks a big shift for Ukraine, which has fought to join Nato as a safeguard against Russian attacks and has such an aspiration included in its constitution. It also meets one of Russia’s war aims, although Kyiv has so far held firm against ceding territory to Moscow.\n\n“Representatives held in-depth discussions regarding the 20-point plan for peace, economic agendas, and more. A lot of progress was made,” Witkoff wrote in a post on X.\n\nThe talks were hosted by the German chancellor, Friedrich Merz, who a source said had made brief remarks before leaving the two sides to negotiate. Other European leaders are also due in Germany for talks on Monday.\n\nZelenskyy described the concession on Nato as a compromise.\n\n“From the very beginning, Ukraine’s desire was to join Nato: these are real security guarantees. Some partners from the US and Europe did not support this direction,” he said – adding that legally binding security guarantees from the US, Europe and other countries such as Canada and Japan could “prevent another Russian invasion”.\n\nVladimir Putin has repeatedly demanded that Ukraine officially renounce its Nato ambitions and withdraw troops from approximately 10% of Donbas that Kyiv still controls. Moscow has also said that Ukraine must be a neutral country, and that no Nato troops can be stationed there.\n\nRussian sources said earlier this year that Putin wants a “written” pledge by leading western powers not to enlarge the US-led Nato alliance eastwards – shorthand for formally ruling out membership to Ukraine, Georgia, Moldova and other former Soviet republics.\n\nZelenskyy had earlier called for a “dignified” peace and guarantees that Russia would not attack Ukraine again.\n\nUnder pressure from Trump to sign a peace deal that initially backed Moscow’s demands, Zelenskyy accused Russia of dragging out the war through deadly bombings of cities, as well as Ukraine’s power and water supplies.\n\nSending Witkoff, who has led negotiations with Ukraine and Russia on a US peace proposal, appeared to be a signal that Washington saw a chance of progress nearly four years after Russia’s 2022 invasion.\n\nZelenskyy said Ukraine, Europe and the US are looking at a 20-point plan, and that at the end of this there is a ceasefire. He said Kyiv has had no direct talks with Moscow.\n\nA ceasefire along the current frontlines would be a fair option, he added.\n\nBritain, France and Germany have been working to refine the US proposals, which in a draft disclosed last month called for Kyiv to cede more territory, abandon its Nato ambitions and accept limits on its armed forces.\n\nEuropean allies have described this as a “critical moment” that could shape Ukraine’s future, and sought to shore up Kyiv’s finances by leveraging frozen Russian central bank assets to fund Kyiv’s military and civilian budget.",

Writing code consistently helps us\n\nSolving programming questions is about developing logic but things become a little trickier when we build a complex system, as it requires us to take our programming skills to go up a notch. Some examples of complex systems are - a Library management system, a Twitter clone, an Instagram clone, etc. Building a complex system\n\nAfter we spend some time writing programs and solving problems, things become monotonous and do not seem to challenge us anymore, so to spice things up a bit we should model something from the real world, like\n\nThere are lots of libraries and framework like p5.js that makes visual programming simple.\n\nIt is not only writing code that improves our programming skills but it is reading some quality code written by expert programmers that make the difference. Reading code written by experts improve our programming vocabulary and by doing this we\n\nThe best way to start doing it is by picking up an open-source project and start skimming the code. It is okay to not understand it in the first go but it is important to skim it a few times and get acquainted. After a few skim, everything will fall in place, the code becomes familiar and we start to understand the flow and business logic.\n\nThere is always someone sitting on the other side of the globe, who knows a thing or two more than us. Look for them and collaborate on a project. The developer community is filled with super smart and super enthusiastic developers who love to share and collaborate. Use websites like Dev.to, Hashnode and Twitter to find and interact with like-minded people.\n\nA programming language is just a tool to express business logic. While learning a programming language we should try to understand the constructs and paradigms used - for example: Functional programming, Polymorphism, Event driven programming, Actor model, etc. It is important to do so because we could pick constructs from one language and use it in another to solve our problem. For example: picking Functional programming (Callbacks) from Javascript and using it in Python to create generic action functions.\n\nWriting code before putting in some thought is degraded the code more often than not. The code written like this lacks simplicity, reusability, and extensibility. Spending some time thinking about problem statement or task at hand and having a rough execution plan always helps.\n\nThese rituals have helped me get better at programming with time and in parallel, I pick at max 3 and act on the action items. Programming is simple but being better than most is difficult. Doing it consistently makes one get better by the day.",

    "fullText": "Rebecca Ann “Burger Becky” Heineman passed away last month, after a brief but intense battle with cancer. Her contributions to video game history are innumerable; if you’ve played a video game made within the past 30 years, chances are she had a hand in its creation in some way. After meeting her at GDC in March 2014, she quickly became one of my mentors. But more than that, I am proud to call her my friend, both of her and her late wife Jennell Jaquays.\n\nBecky and I would chat about all sorts of things, ranging from industry gossip to life to pop culture to programming. I am sad that my friend is no longer available for late night messages or calls, but I’ll always have fond memories to look back upon, not to mention her valuable lessons and wisdom. Some of these I’d like to share in this post.\n\nMy “first encounter” with Becky was not with her directly but, as with most people, through her work, though I didn’t know it at the time.\n\nMy dad—now retired—was a high school band director in 1994. That fall, one of his students gave him a floppy disk with the three-level shareware First Encounter of Wolfenstein 3D for Mac, and encouraged my dad to take it home and play it. Dad played it for about ten seconds and quickly determined it wasn’t for him, but knowing my penchant for gaming, he let me give it a try instead. My sister and I played through those three levels over and over through the rest of that year. I asked for—and got—the full ninety-level version for Christmas.\n\nI had never seen a game like it before; its first-person perspective and animation (such as it was; my dad’s 16MHz Macintosh II could barely run it) blew me away and set my expectations for what a computer game could be. Yet at that time, young me thought that software creation was the work of teams of white-coated scientists in sterilized laboratories like I saw in cartoons; surely this game had to have been developed by a large company armed with legions of workers. After all, the game opened with logos for two very legitimate-looking studios: MacPlay, and id Software. Still, the seed was planted in my head as I slowly taught myself programming that maybe, someday, I could be good enough to work for a company making something as enthralling as Wolfenstein.\n\nMy first interaction with Becky would come several years later, in 2001.\n\nI was following Becky on social media by this time, but I received an unsolicited message from her on Facebook in September 2013. Seems she had seen the news about the Keen source code, and wanted to talk. 😀 I was more than willing to chat, especially knowing that she had the source code to the Mac version of Wolfenstein 3D she had done almost a decade prior. I finally met Becky in person for the first time at GDC 2014, ambushing her after a panel she was on at Moscone North. She fortunately recognized me and we became Facebook friends very shortly after that, instantly bonding over game programming and industry history. At GDC 2016 I offered to buy her dinner at Buca di Beppo; the deal we arranged was that I’d provide the food, and she would provide the entertainment in the form of war stories. 😀 I got to learn the “true Hollywood story” of the Mac versions of not only Wolfenstein 3D, but of the cancelled port of Half-Life. Someday maybe I’ll write a bit about what I learned that night.\n\nI shipped The Journeyman Project: Pegasus Prime on DVD and GoG in late 2013 to coincide with The Journeyman Project’s 30th anniversary. The production of that by itself warrants its own story, but leading up to the fall of 2016 I was putting the finishing touches on a version for Steam that integrated the Steamworks API for achievements, cloud saves, and controller support. It was with the lattermost that I was having trouble; I encountered, verified, and documented—with reliable repro steps—a bug in Steamworks’s controller code… but could not find a way to communicate any of this to Steamworks engineers at Valve! The official way to report bugs, as it was explained to me, was to make a post on Steam’s forums. I did so, but was met with fellow programmers and non-programmers—none of whom from Valve—advising me to follow the same steps outlined in the Steamworks documentation with which I was well familiar. Ugh. No amount of my explaining “no, I found a legitimate bug here” would get me an audience with an engineer who could help upstream a patch.\n\nWith myself going nowhere through the “official” channels, I realized: Steam Dev Days is coming up in October 2016. I registered myself and scored an invitation to Valve’s developer conference in Seattle. For the price of round-trip plane tickets, my goal was to track down and corner a Steamworks programmer and show them the bug I was fighting. I managed to do so; after waiting in line for a couple hours (most folks were there to talk about Valve’s forays into virtual reality) it took only 30 seconds to demonstrate and explain the problem to the engineer, and sure enough, two weeks later the release notes of the latest version of the Steam client indicated my bug was fixed. ❤️\n\nBecky and Jennell were living in a high-rise apartment in the Belltown neighborhood of Seattle. They graciously offered to let me stay with them, which was great because my visit was pretty low-budget anyway. That evening, I arrived at their apartment complex, but because Becky was out running an errand, nobody was there to meet me. The neighborhood was perhaps not the safest in town; not that I was worried for myself, but I preferred being indoors at that time of the night. The complex wouldn’t let me in without somebody to come get me, so Jennell came down to greet me, and it was here that I met Jennell for the first time. We talked for hours about her time at id Software, and stories—with varying degrees of “juiciness”—about her experiences there.\n\nBecky and Jennell moved down to El Cerrito in 2018. I loved this; it meant they lived close enough to me that I could hang out with them a lot more often, which I did. I would often deliver them food, watch their place, and grab any delivered packages while they were away. Becky likewise came down to my housewarming in 2018.\n\nTheir archives took up their entire two-car garage, but Becky and Jennell spent most of their time in the front room both doing what they loved most: making games and caring for their cats. Jennell also liked to make and paint miniatures. Years ago, at SVVR 2016, I had myself 3D scanned in a couple of different poses. I sent Jennell one of the files and, on one visit, was delighted to find a tiny painted 3D-printed miniature of myself in her collection, done up to resemble a zombie.\n\nI drove Becky and Jennell up to Portland for the October 2018 Portland Retro Gaming Expo in my 2007 Mitsubishi Eclipse. They in turn let me stay with them in their room at the Crowne Plaza downtown. We went to Prime Rib + Chocolate Cake for dinner (RIP), and the next day I joined Becky with David Crane, Garry Kitchen, and other Activision alumni for lunch at the Red Robin across from the convention center.\n\nBecky bought herself a boxed LaserDisc player at the show, and sat with it in the back seat of my Eclipse the whole ride home. Poor Jennell rode in the front seat and was uncomfortable most of the ride, owing to her stature, though she opted to recline as much as she could for as long as she could during the return trip.\n\nIn 2020, Becky and Jennell moved to the Dallas area into the home that Jennell had designed during her time at id Software. Becky would appear at several QuakeCons after that and we’d often hang out; I’d always save her a spot next to me in the BYOC, and she got to meet several members of my Quake clan as well as catch up with friends of hers connected to id, Microsoft, and the 90s gaming scene. One QuakeCon in particular stands out to me: in 2023, I made a point to get lunch with Becky and Jennell at the nearest Torchy’s Tacos. That turned out to be the last time I’d ever see Jennell; she sadly passed away in January 2024. Becky and I continued to hang out whenever I was in Dallas, usually preferring Torchy’s again in memory of that first lunch with her and Jennell. She would also occasionally host her Burgertime streams where I participated in the chat, and when gossip got “too hot for TV” we’d talk on the phone every now and again.\n\nLike most folks close to her, I learned of her cancer diagnosis via her social media announcement. In my last phone call with her, I asked how she was feeling and expressed how confident I was that she’d beat it given how prompt she was with her discovery and medical attention. She continued to have an upbeat attitude and sense of humor in spite of two rounds of chemotherapy and the ultimately unfortunate prognosis. I was in midtown Manhattan when she shared the news from her doctors that she was unlikely to make it through the rest of the following week. She and I had a brief exchange on Discord that Sunday night, but I had a gut feeling that I should try to see her as soon as possible, so upon arriving home early Monday morning I got on the first flight to Dallas.\n\nI made it to the hospital just in time to see Becky and say goodbye. Along with several members of her family, I was with her two hours later when she passed that Monday afternoon.\n\nAs I’m writing this, it still hasn’t quite hit me that she’s gone. Her work endures, and there is so much that she created and put out into the world that memories of her will linger probably well after I have left this earth. The late-night Discord chats, the GDC dinners and meet-and-greets, the random shenanigans, encounters at nerdy conventions… there will always be an empty spot—both physically and metaphysically—in these places from now on. I owe a lot of my career in games to Burger Becky, and with her passing, the world has suffered a great loss. But for all that the loss of Becky has taken from us, she has put so much back into the world. Over the past month I’ve met a number of her friends—both industry and not—who through very personal stories have corroborated just how generous of a person she was. I used to selfishly think I was her protégé, but she was a mentor to so many more people both in their careers and in life. I will miss her greatly, but as long as her memories persist and I pay forward her generosity, she’ll always be with me in some form. I hope that in this way I can introduce new friends to Becky who weren’t as lucky to have met her in real life.\n\nRest in power, Burger Becky. Narf! ❤️",

    "title": "Dark mode is essential, not a design preference",
    "description": "Dark mode is often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a necessity or assistive technology.",
    "fullText": "Dark mode has emerged as one of the most significant accessibility considerations in digital design, yet it is still often treated as a nice-to-have rather than a fundamental feature. Many organisations adhere to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure accessibility compliance, but compliance does not always equate to usability.\n\nFor blind and low-vision users, as well as some neurodivergent individuals, dark mode is not just a preference—it is a necessity. It reduces glare, enhances contrast, and extends the time users can comfortably engage with digital content. Without it, users experience fatigue, headaches, and even an inability to complete tasks, ultimately leading to frustration, abandonment, and exclusion from digital services.\n\nWhen we speak directly to users with lived experience, the importance of dark mode becomes even clearer.\n\nDaniel describes why his phone is permanently set to dark mode:\n\n“My phone's permanently set on a dark mode to reduce the glare of any of the white screens or anything just blasting me in the eyes. It helps me use screens for longer so my eyes don't get as fatigued at the end of the day. Even people who have lost 99% of their vision still have a light sensitivity.”\n\nThis statement challenges a common misconception about blindness—many blind individuals still have some residual vision, and light sensitivity remains a significant issue. For them, bright screens are not just inconvenient; they are painful and actively reduce their ability to engage in digital work and communication.\n\nDan emphasises the connection between screen brightness and headaches and fatigue:\n“When you have this bright light just blasting you in the eyes, it's painful, it gives you headaches. Most of your job you're doing these days, you're looking at a computer screen. There are very few jobs where you're not looking at a computer screen. So if you want to extend how long you're able to do that work for, you need to try and get the most favourable conditions for your eyes.”\n\nThis highlights the occupational accessibility barriers that bright screens create. Digital tools should empower people to work efficiently, not force them into discomfort and early fatigue.\nAnother challenge with bright white backgrounds is the way it affects readability:\n“A bright white background is an issue because it causes bleeding into the other colours. So if you have thin black writing on a white background, the white's so bright that it kind of makes it hard to look at the black writing.”\n\nThis phenomenon, known as halation, makes text appear blurred or distorted for many users, reducing legibility and comprehension. Conversely, dark backgrounds with white text provide greater clarity. Patrick, who has a degenerative eye condition explains:\n“White text on a black background doesn't just look cool, it's much easier on the eyes. When I used white on black, it was easier because the print would stand out much more. Even looking at the time was much easier. The numbers would just jump at you.”\n\nFor users with low vision, neurodivergent conditions like dyslexia, and even those experiencing age-related vision decline, dark mode significantly improves readability and usability.\n\nDespite dark mode's widespread popularity, there is surprisingly little formal research or quantitative data on its accessibility benefits. However, after aggregating insights across multiple See Me Please user testing projects—each involving 18 diverse participants, including 3 blind, 3 with low vision, 3 neurodivergent, 3 Deaf or Hard of Hearing, 3 over 70, and 3 with limited English proficiency—we were struck by how often dark mode emerged as the most requested feature. It was consistently the top accessibility request across companies, often ranking higher than other common accessibility improvements. Based on our experience, we estimate that around 75% of our low vision testers and at least half of our blind testers express a strong preference or need for dark mode.\n\nThis aligns with broader user preferences, as many others—including neurodivergent users and those sensitive to screen brightness—also value dark mode for comfort and usability. While accessibility standards often overlook dark mode, our findings suggest it is a critical feature that enhances real-world usability for a wide range of users.\n\nDesign and development teams only have so much capacity, and when considering investments in accessibility, it's crucial to prioritise features that deliver the greatest impact for users. Our user testing strongly suggests that dark mode is not just a preference but a necessity, resonating far more than the collective value placed on embedded read-aloud features, which are often included on websites but rarely requested by people with a disability with the same urgency. If organisations are weighing accessibility investments, particularly in enterprise settings, thinking about how dark mode can be integrated—at least in new applications—could provide far greater usability benefits than other commonly implemented accessibility features\n\nWCAG provides an essential foundation for digital accessibility, yet it does not specifically require dark mode support. While it recommends sufficient contrast (WCAG 2.1, Success Criterion 1.4.3), the standard does not ensure that interfaces are comfortable for all users.\nStudies on dark mode’s impact show that:\n\nDespite these benefits, many organisations assume meeting WCAG contrast requirements is enough. However, true accessibility is about usability, not just compliance. If a user is technically able to read content but experiences discomfort, pain, or excessive strain, that content is not truly accessible.\n\nWithout dark mode, users often face severe consequences:\n\nFor businesses and government agencies, failing to offer dark mode creates barriers to service access, particularly for those who rely on assistive technologies.\n\nMany users rely on plug-ins and third-party tools like Dark Reader, Midnight Lizard, and Stylus to force dark mode on websites that don’t natively support it. While these tools provide short-term solutions, they are essentially overlays, which introduce several accessibility issues.\n\nOverlays modify the display at the browser level, rather than adjusting the UI in a way that is intended, tested, or optimised by the original developers. This can cause:\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions about overlays is that they solve accessibility problems. In reality, they often introduce new barriers rather than removing them.\n\nThe key difference between pushing colour inversion with a plug-in versus native dark mode comes down to control and consistency. Colour inversion, when applied through a plug-in or system-wide setting, works as an overlay that forcibly inverts colours at the browser level rather than adjusting the UI as intended. This can cause significant distortions to images, icons, and visual elements, often making essential content unreadable— for example, a blue sky might turn orange, and important graphs or charts may lose their meaning. Additionally, colour inversion frequently results in inconsistent styling, breaking UI elements, making text difficult to read, and creating poor contrast ratios that worsen accessibility instead of improving it. Users often find themselves constantly adjusting settings, toggling between modes just to complete simple tasks, leading to unnecessary frustration and cognitive load.\n\nIn contrast, native dark mode is designed intentionally within an application to provide a seamless and accessible experience. It ensures proper contrast and readability, preserving the original intent of the design while keeping images and key visual cues intact. Native dark mode works smoothly with assistive technologies, including screen readers, and prevents the need for users to rely on third-party fixes. While plug-in-based colour inversion can serve as a temporary workaround, it is ultimately a patchwork solution that introduces new usability issues, whereas native dark mode provides a structured, user-friendly approach that truly enhances accessibility.\n\nAnother common workaround is colour inversion, available in operating system accessibility settings. This setting flips light to dark and vice versa, making bright screens easier to tolerate. However, this also inverts images, icons, and visual elements, which can:\n\nThis constant toggling between modes adds unnecessary cognitive load and frustration, making simple tasks time-consuming and exhausting.\n\nInstead of relying on overlays and forced inversion, websites and apps should natively support dark mode in their design. A well-implemented dark mode ensures that all visual elements are designed intentionally, avoiding the distortions caused by inversion, colour contrast and legibility are optimised for all users and dark mode can be toggled at the user’s preference, rather than relying on inefficient and frustrating workarounds.\n\nGlobally, over 2.2 billion people have some form of vision impairment, and 1 in 5 people are neurodivergent. Many of these individuals benefit from dark mode, making it a high-impact accessibility feature.\nMoreover, the value of offering dark mode and benefit so many more users. For example\n\nDark mode is not just a design trend—it is a fundamental accessibility need. While WCAG provides a great starting point, lived experience must drive digital accessibility efforts. By offering native dark mode support, organisations can create truly inclusive digital experiences and ensure that all users can engage comfortably and effectively.\n\nAs Mary, our wise blind tester said\n“We know what we need and we know what we want from programmes or apps. So it is always best to ask the user.”\n\nLets start listening on those who rely on accessible online services, rather than obsessing over WCAG conformance.",

    "description": "The two-time Emmy winner and Oscar nominee and his wife, Michele, were found dead in their Brentwood home.",
    "fullText": "Rob Reiner, who directed such beloved Hollywood classics as This Is Spinal Tap, Stand by Me and When Harry Met Sally after starring in the trailblazing sitcom All in the Family, died Sunday along with his wife, Michele, in their Brentwood home, TMZ reported. He was 78.\n\nReiner and his wife, 70, were found dead in their home on Chadbourne Avenue, with the couple “suffering lacerations consistent with a knife,” law enforcement sources told TMZ. The Los Angeles Fire Department had been called to their house at about 3:30 p.m., and LAPD Robbery Homicide Division detectives were investigating.\n\nThe Princess Bride (1987), Misery (1990), the Oscar best picture nominee A Few Good Men (1992), The American President (1995) and The Bucket List (2007) also were among Reiner’s 20-plus directing credits.\n\nReiner was also a co-founder of Castle Rock Entertainment, the production company behind such films as City Slickers (1991), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Waiting for Guffman (1996), Miss Congeniality (2000), Best in Show (2000), Michael Clayton (2007) and Seinfeld, one of the most lucrative television properties of all time.\n\nFrom the outset of his feature directorial career with This Is Spinal Tap (1984), Reiner seemed to reimagine Hollywood standards, creating and starring in the first mainstream mockumentary — a rock ’n’ roll satire so dead-on, film critic Roger Ebert called it “one of the funniest movies ever made.” From there, he would move seamlessly from comedy to drama, from fantasy to horror, as few directors ever have.\n\nReiner would establish yet another benchmark — this time for romantic comedies — with When Harry Met Sally (1989), screenwriter Nora Ephron’s ode to true love (based loosely on her and Reiner’s lives) that starred Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan.\n\nHis biggest box office hit, the gripping courtroom drama A Few Good Men, based on Aaron Sorkin’s 1989 play and starring Tom Cruise and Jack Nicholson, could not have been more different.\n\nSome of Reiner’s movies took a while to capture the world’s attention. The Princess Bride, his timeless fairy tale adventure that was based on the William Goldman novel and starred Robin Wright, Mandy Patinkin and Peter Falk, was one of several films that grew in popularity over decades on the way to cult status.\n\nOn television, Reiner played to some of the biggest audiences in history, first in the role of Michael “Meathead” Stivic, the liberal antagonist of Carroll O’Connor’s Archie Bunker, on CBS’ All in the Family, and then as a ground-floor executive on NBC’s Seinfeld, which he fought to keep on the air.\n\n“We knew we had a great show,” Reiner told Howard Stern in 2016.\n\nBut after a rocky launch in the summer of 1989, the network was concerned that Seinfeld — famously a show “about nothing” — was a misfire. After four episodes, it was on the brink of cancellation.\n\n“I went in there and had a screaming crazy thing with [NBC president] Brandon Tartikoff,” Reiner said. “And I promised him — there will be stories!”\n\nIn 1993, Reiner and Castle Rock partners Andrew Scheinman, Alan Horn, Glenn Padnick and Martin Shafer sold their company to broadcast mogul Ted Turner for about $160 million. (It became part of Time Warner when it acquired Turner Broadcasting in 1996.)\n\nThe principals stayed on, holding to their original ideal: to make independent movies outside the traditional studio system. But after a run of poorly performing films starting in the late ’90s, Castle Rock initiated layoffs and eventually was absorbed into Warner Bros.\n\nIn 2020, Reiner relaunched the company and revived its film division a year later, with Spinal Tap II: The End Continues (2025) among its offerings.\n\n“There’s not one film that I’ve ever made that could get made today by a studio, not one — even A Few Good Men,” Reiner said. “Every movie that I make, have made and will make is always going to be independently financed.”\n\nThroughout his behind-the-camera career, Reiner continued as a working actor. He played the well-intentioned plastic surgeon Dr. Morris Packman, who affectionately spars with Goldie Hawn, in The First Wives Club (1996); Tom Hanks’ pal in Ephron’s Sleepless in Seattle (1993); and the father of Zooey Deschanel on the 2011-18 Fox sitcom New Girl.\n\nHe was particularly memorable in Martin Scorsese’s The Wolf of Wall Street (2013) as stockbroker Max Belfort in scenes with Leonardo DiCaprio and Jonah Hill that were largely improvised.\n\nReiner’s sense of what worked onscreen was honed early on — first at home as the oldest child of comedy icon Carl Reiner and later around his dad’s close friends, among them Sid Caesar, Neil Simon, Mel Brooks and the most influential of all, Norman Lear, the TV auteur whose 1970s activist comedies All in the Family, The Jeffersons, Good Times and Maude sparked seismic shifts in popular culture.\n\n“Norman was the first guy who recognized that I had any talent,” Reiner wrote for The Hollywood Reporter in the wake of Lear’s 2023 death, noting that he viewed him as “a second father.”\n\n“It wasn’t just that he hired me for All in the Family,” Reiner told American Masters in 2005. “It was that I saw, in how he conducted his life, that there was room to be an activist as well. That you could use your celebrity, your good fortune, to help make some change.”\n\nAs the Hollywood scion forged his directing career, it was Lear who put up the money for Stand by Me (1986) and Reiner’s other early films, including the John Cusack-Nicollette Sheridan romp The Sure Thing (1985), lauded for elevating the teen comedy genre.\n\nStand by Me — regarded as among the finest of coming-of-age movies — marked Reiner’s ascent into Hollywood’s highest ranks, no longer just a sitcom actor or the genial ex-husband of a fellow TV comic, Penny Marshall, star of Laverne & Shirley. (Marshall too would go on to become a top Hollywood director.)\n\nFamed author-screenwriter Goldman, who penned the Misery screenplay, said Reiner became a success because his work is “funny, but not simpy.”\n\n“His films have a certain comedy style … a sweetness and toughness,” Goldman told The New York Times in 1987. “Stand by Me is not just about four kids coming of age before junior high school — they’re going to see a corpse. If John Hughes had made Stand by Me — and I’m not knocking Hughes — they would have been searching for a convertible.”\n\nStephen King, author of the 1982 novella The Body (on which Stand by Me was based) and the 1987 novel Misery, became one of Reiner’s most-steadfast collaborators.\n\nAmong other King books turned into movies by Castle Rock — Reiner named the company for the fictional setting in many of the author’s novels — were Shawshank, The Green Mile (1999)and Dolores Claiborne (1995).\n\nAfter several false starts, King finally agreed to develop Misery for the screen, but only if Reiner put “his name on it” as producer or director.\n\n“It was a very personal book to him,” Reiner told TCM in 2021. “It was all about himself as a writer and feeling trapped … And so he let us option the book for $1. In fact, I think we made seven Stephen King films, and each one of them we got an option for $1.”\n\nThe 1990 Kathy Bates-James Caan starrer remains one of Hollywood’s finest horror pieces, with Bates winning an Oscar for her role as the obsessive fan Annie Wilkes, who tortures author Paul Sheldon (Caan) while holding him hostage in her remote cabin.\n\n“Rob had a fantastic crew of people — people he had worked with for years, just the creme de la creme,” Bates said of the Misery shoot in a 2020 interview with Vanity Fair. “I learned so much just hanging out [on set] and watching.”\n\nBates, 42 years old at the time, had predominantly been a stage actress. At the Academy Awards, where she bested Meryl Streep, Joanne Woodward, Anjelica Huston and Julia Roberts, she thanked Reiner “for taking a chance on me.”\n\nOften the most memorable scenes in Reiner’s filmography came from his comedies — notably Ryan’s climactic moment in When Harry Met Sally in which she feigns an orgasm over lunch with Crystal’s character at Katz’s Deli.\n\nYet it was Reiner’s mother, Estelle Reiner, who landed the film’s renowned punchline: “I’ll have what she’s having.”\n\n“I said to her, mom, the line you have is the last line in the scene, and if it doesn’t pop and top everything that’s come before it, I won’t use it,” Reiner told the AFI in a joint interview with Ephron in 2009. “We’ll shoot it but be prepared, it might have to be cut.\n\n“And she said, ‘I don’t care, I just wanna spend the day with you and be with you on the set. I don’t care if it’s in the movie or not.’”\n\nRobert Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 6, 1947, one of three children of the former Estelle Lebost, an artist and set designer, and Carl Reiner, the comic and writer who got his start as an entertainer in the U.S. Army and then in Broadway musicals.\n\nThe family lived just off Grand Concourse, across the street from Marshall and her brother, future writer-producer-director Garry Marshall. But it would be decades before Rob and Penny actually met — at the 1970 audition in Los Angeles for the roles of Mike and Gloria Stivik on All in the Family. (The role of Gloria, of course, would go to Sally Struthers.)\n\nAs Carl’s career gained steam (he would win 11 Emmys), the family moved to Bonnie Meadow Road in the bucolic New York suburb of New Rochelle. It was the very street where Reiner would set his landmark 1960s CBS sitcom The Dick Van Dyke Show, about a rising comedy writer, Rob Petrie, and his beautiful wife, Laura.\n\n“Basically he wrote his own life in The Dick Van Dyke Show,” Rob Reiner said of his father. “And my mother was Mary Tyler Moore.”\n\nRob got his start as an apprentice at the Bucks County Playhouse in Pennsylvania and with small guest roles on such shows as That Girl, Room 222 and The Beverly Hillbillies.\n\nAfter UCLA Film School in 1967, he was paired with another young comic, Steve Martin, as a writing team on CBS’ The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour. The two were barely out of their teens.\n\nThe All in the Family role, for which Reiner would win two Emmys, followed in 1971. Convinced the show’s incendiary subject matter would be rejected by viewers, he initially viewed the gig as a stopgap to tide him over between writing gigs.\n\nWhen the sitcom became a hit (Reiner stayed for eight of its nine seasons), he continued writing anyway, penning four episodes of the show and co-writing (with Garry Marshall and Phil Mishkin) the first episode of ABC’s Happy Days in 1974.\n\nAs a filmmaker notably surrounding himself with many of the industry’s top writers — Goldman, King, Sorkin, Ephron, Crystal — Reiner showcased their dialogue to everlasting effect.\n\nThe Princess Bride’s “Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die”; Misery’s “I’m your No. 1 fan”; A Few Good Men’s “You can’t handle the truth”; and When Harry Met Sally’s “I’ll have what she’s having” (Crystal actually came up with that line) reigned in pop culture for decades.\n\nBut as Penny Marshall would humorously point out, no matter how substantive their accomplishments, “For me, all they say is ‘Laverne,’ and for Rob … it’s ‘Meathead,’” she told the New Yorker in 2012. “We’re stuck with it.”\n\nThe couple performed together infrequently but did co-star in the well-received 1978 romantic comedy More Than Friends. The ABC telefilm, written by Reiner and Mishkin and directed by James Burrows, was something of a precursor to When Harry Met Sally, about childhood pals unsure if they should pursue love as adults.\n\nReiner also made an appearance as “Sheldn” (no “o”), the fiancé of Penny’s Myrna Turner, on Garry Marshall’s ABC series The Odd Couple.\n\nTheir 10-year marriage came to an end in 1981 — amid tension as Laverne & Shirley shot Marshall to superstardom while Reiner was quietly forging his post-sitcom film career.\n\nUpon Marshall’s death in 2018, Reiner professed his admiration for her, tweeting “so sad about Penny.” He added, “I loved Penny. I grew up with her. She was born with a great gift. She was born with a funny bone and the instinct of how to use it. I was very lucky to have lived with her and her funny bone. I will miss her.”\n\nThe couple were the parents of actress Tracy Reiner, born in 1964 to Marshall during a brief first marriage and adopted by Reiner soon after their 1971 wedding.\n\nIn 1989, Reiner married Michele Singer, a photographer whom he met on the set of When Harry Met Sally. He said she was the inspiration for the film’s happily-ever-after script change. In 2020, she joined Reiner in running Castle Rock. The couple had three children, Nick, Jake and Romy.\n\nA lifelong political activist who with King was among the public figures to urge President Joe Biden to hand the 2024 re-election reins to Kamala Harris, Reiner rarely missed a week on social media, penning calls to action on a range of social justice issues for his millions of followers.\n\nHe was among Hollywood’s most vigorous and constant voices opposing Donald Trump.\n\nAmong his other causes, Reiner was the co-founder of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, which fought to overturn California’s ban on same-sex marriage. In the late-’90s, he and his father were activists for higher taxes on cigarettes — money that was earmarked for prenatal care.\n\nHis advocacy was often part of his writing and filmmaking, from his earliest days with the Smothers brothers to LBJ (2016) and Shock and Awe (2017), about journalists investigating the Bush administration’s 2003 invasion of Iraq.\n\nReiner was often a Hollywood peacemaker, well known for putting actors and crew at ease. When Bates and Caan clashed early in the production of Misery (she liked rehearsing; he preferred winging it), Reiner brokered a wary peace while using the tension to elicit superb performances.\n\n“I want everyone around me to feel comfortable and happy,” he told The Guardian in 2018. “People only act up out of insecurity, and when they make it difficult, I just say, ‘We’re playing make-believe here — enjoy yourself!’”",

    "fullText": "GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) — Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo on Sunday said he had declared a state of emergency in two municipalities in western Guatemala a day after armed men attacked a military post and a police station, cut off roads and hijacked buses, killing at least five people.\n\nCriminal gangs are attempting to force security forces to withdraw in order to take control of the region, Arévalo said. He said his government would reinforce security.\n\nThis state of emergency, the first declared by his government, will last for 15 days in the municipalities of Nahuala and Santa Catarina Ixtahuacan in the department of Solola.\n\n“We are at a critical moment for the department of Solola and the security of the country,” Arévalo said, accompanied Interior Minister Marco Villeda and José Giovanni Martínez Milán, the acting Defense Minister and head of General Staff.\n\nArévalo showed videos and photos from Saturday’s events, in which armed men - some dressed in camouflage or military uniforms, wearing helmets and bulletproof vests and carrying high-caliber weapons - can be seen shooting or taking cover just meters away from a busy main road.\n\nThe criminal groups are linked to extortion and drug trafficking and pose a threat to the local communities, Arévalo said.\n\n“The communities are not alone,” he said.\n\nInterior Minister Marco Villeda said that five people had died. On Saturday, the director of the National Civil Police, David Botero, said that six people had died, including a soldier.\n\nThe incidents are believed to have started last Thursday when armed men attacked the military post, leaving four people wounded at that time.\n\nThe two municipalities have had disputes for several decades over water sources and local roads they both claim as their own. These disputes have led to dozens of deaths.\n\n“In this case, there was no attack between the communities. This was an attack on the military post, intentionally and specifically,” Arévalo said.\n\nThe state of emergency limits the rights to open-air meetings, public demonstrations and events. It allows for the dissolution by force of any unauthorized gatherings, groups, or public demonstrations, particularly those involving weapons or violent acts.\n\nIt also limits the right to protests that affect free movement or public services, which can be forcibly dissolved, and restricts the right to carry weapons.",

    "description": "A tragic irony.",
    "fullText": "On a stormy Monday in March, 1827, the German composer Ludwig van Beethoven passed away after a protracted illness.\n\nBedridden since the previous Christmas, he was ravaged by jaundice, his limbs and abdomen swollen, and every breath a struggle.\n\nAs his associates sorted through personal belongings, they uncovered a document Beethoven had written a quarter of a century earlier – a will beseeching his brothers to make details of his condition known to the public.\n\nToday it is no secret that one of the greatest musicians the world has ever known was functionally deaf by his mid-40s.\n\nIt was a tragic irony Beethoven wished the world understood, not just from a personal perspective, but a medical one.\n\nThe composer would outlive his doctor by nearly two decades, yet close to two centuries after Beethoven's death, a team of researchers set out to fulfill his testament in ways he would never have dreamed possible, by genetically analyzing the DNA in authenticated samples of his hair.\n\nWatch the video below for a summary of the research:\n\n\"Our primary goal was to shed light on Beethoven's health problems, which famously include progressive hearing loss, beginning in his mid- to late-20s and eventually leading to him being functionally deaf by 1818,\" biochemist Johannes Krause from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany explained in a press statement in 2023, when the results were unveiled.\n\nThe primary cause of that hearing loss has never been known, not even to his personal physician Dr Johann Adam Schmidt.\n\nWhat began as tinnitus in his 20s slowly gave way to a reduced tolerance for loud noise, and eventually a loss of hearing in the higher pitches, effectively ending his career as a performing artist.\n\nFor a musician, nothing could be more ironic. In a letter addressed to his brothers, Beethoven admitted he was \"hopelessly afflicted\", to the point of contemplating suicide.\n\nIt wasn't just hearing loss the composer had to deal with in his adult life. From at least the age of 22 he is said to have suffered severe abdominal pains and chronic bouts of diarrhea.\n\nSix years before his death the first indications of liver disease appeared, an illness thought to have been, at least in part, responsible for his death at the relatively young age of 56.\n\nIn 2007 a forensic investigation into a lock of hair believed to belong to Beethoven suggested that lead poisoning could have hastened his death, if not have been ultimately responsible for the symptoms that claimed his life.\n\nGiven the culture of drinking from lead vessels and medical treatments of the time that involved the use of lead, it's hardly a surprising conclusion.\n\nThis latest study, published in March 2023, debunks the theory, however, revealing that the hair never came from Beethoven in the first place, but rather an unknown woman.\n\nMore importantly, several locks confirmed as far more likely to be from the composer's head indicate his death was probably caused by a hepatitis B infection, exacerbated by his drinking and numerous risk factors for liver disease.\n\n\"We cannot say definitely what killed Beethoven, but we can now at least confirm the presence of significant heritable risk, and an infection with hepatitis B virus,\" explained Krause.\n\n\"We can also eliminate several other less plausible genetic causes.\"\n\n\"We were unable to find a definitive cause for Beethoven's deafness or gastrointestinal problems,\" Krause said.\n\nIn some ways, we're left with more questions on the life and death of the famous classical composer.\n\nWhere did he contract hepatitis? How did a lock of woman's hair pass as Beethoven's own for centuries? And just what was behind his gut pains and hearing loss?\n\nGiven the team was inspired by Beethoven's desire for the world to understand his hearing loss, it's an unfortunate outcome. Though there was one more surprise buried among his genes.\n\nFurther investigation comparing the Y chromosome in the hair samples with those of modern relatives descending from Beethoven's paternal line point to a mismatch.\n\nThis suggests extramarital sexual activity in the generations leading up to the composer's birth.\n\n\"This finding suggests an extrapair paternity event in his paternal line between the conception of Hendrik van Beethoven in Kampenhout, Belgium in c.1572 and the conception of Ludwig van Beethoven seven generations later in 1770, in Bonn, Germany,\" said Tristan Begg, a biological anthropologist now at the University of Cambridge in the UK.\n\nIt could all be a little more than a younger Beethoven bargained for, considering the fateful request he put to paper.\n\nNever would he have dreamed of the secrets that were being preserved as his friends and associates clipped the hair from his body in the wake of that somber stormy Monday night in 1827.\n\nThis research was published in Current Biology.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was published in March 2023.\n\nScientists Analyzed The Obituaries of 38 Million Americans.

    "fullText": "SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) — Puerto Rico Gov. Jenniffer González signed a polemic bill on Sunday that critics say is a blow to democracy and will make it more difficult to access public information in a U.S. territory long known for its lack of government transparency.\n\nGonzález said the bill amends an existing law to provide more defined rules, avoid confusion and reduce what she said was a “considerable number of lawsuits.” She said it also sets penalties for non-compliance\n\nMore than a dozen journalism organizations and civil rights groups have rejected the bill, noting that only one day of public hearings was held on short notice.\n\n“It is inconceivable that Puerto Rico’s leaders would go out of their way to harm their constituents’ access to information and degrade the quality of press freedom on the island,” said Clayton Weimers, executive director for Reporters Without Borders in North America.\n\nWith the new law, government agencies now have 20 business days instead of 10 to hand over documents with fewer than 300 pages or that were created less than three years ago.\n\nAgencies also now have up to one month to release documents longer than 300 pages or more than three years old, with a 20-day extension upheld.\n\n“By signing this measure into law, despite widespread opposition, the governor makes it clear that her interest is not in government transparency,” the ACLU of Puerto Rico said. “(The law) is not in anyone’s best interest, except for any public official who seeks to hinder or prevent the public from receiving the information they have a right to see.”\n\nEarlier this month, a coalition of journalism organizations and civil society groups sent a letter to the governor asking that she veto the bill, calling it a “dangerous infringement on the public’s right to know.”\n\nThe letter noted the bill not only doubles the length of time government agencies have to release requested information, it would also “allow the government to classify information as confidential without judicial review and eliminate personal privacy protections for those requesting information.”\n\nThe bill also removes “the government’s previous obligation under the 2019 law to provide information in the requested format, making data analysis more difficult …(and) would also allow the government to deny valid requests because the information is spread across several documents or agencies,” according to the letter.\n\nObtaining public information in Puerto Rico has long been difficult, often forcing local media organizations that could afford it to go to court despite the government approving a law in 2019 to allow access to public information held by state agencies.\n\nThe 2019 law noted that in Puerto Rico, “citizens and the press are subject to discretionary court processes that are costly and can take months when they request public information. Although the right to access information is enshrined in the Constitution, the lack of a procedural mechanism to enforce it leads to frequent violations.”\n\nThe 2019 law also stated that “many governments have promised transparency but have never committed to it. This is one of the factors that has contributed to the erosion of public trust in the government, which has become a complex, bureaucratic, and opaque structure in its decision-making.”\n\nSeveral years ago, one local newspaper made it a habit to publish its requests for public information and how much time had passed without receiving a response from state agencies.\n\nPuerto Rico’s Senate approved the bill in mid-October with 18 votes in favor and nine against, with no public hearings held. The House passed it in November after only one day of hearings, with 29 votes in favor and 24 against.",

    "fullText": "A major European grocery store recalled one of its goods because it may contain clear plastic pellets.\n\nIrish grocer Dunnes Stores and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland issued the notice for 1-kilogram (2.2-pound) packages of Dunnes organic porridge oats, The Irish Sun reported.\n\n\"Customers are advised not to consume this product, instead to return it to a Dunnes Stores store for a full refund. No receipt is required,\" the company stated, per the Sun. \"We apologize that it has been necessary to recall this product and for the inconvenience caused.\"\n\nThe products were stamped with the batch code 5284 FI, the best-before date of Nov. 10, and times between 06:00 and 12:00. The oats cost €1.39 ($1.62).\n\nDunnes, which has 138 locations in Ireland, Northern Ireland, and Spain, also recently recalled desiccated coconut items because of a similar issue.\n\nPlastic pellets in food are a health hazard. It may be most concerning, however, that the oats reached store shelves before the problem was addressed. If food manufacturing and safety regulations don't prevent this from occurring or stop products from leaving facilities after such events, it raises questions about the ability of companies and agencies to protect the public.\n\nSince plastic is ubiquitous in production and packaging systems, it is common, if not usual, for all kinds of merchandise to be recalled because of plastic contamination. This happens in countries around the world and with various products, including pulled pork sandwiches, whitefish spread, and brownies.\n\nWhile some contaminants may be large enough to see (or choke on), others are microscopic, and microplastics have been linked to a number of health problems, including cancer, infertility, strokes, and heart attacks.\n\nDunnes removed the affected oats from shelves and posted the recall information. Other pollutants, however, create more complex problems. For example, a biodegradable plastic used in food packaging was shown to reprogram mice's metabolic systems.\n\nYou can lower your risks by using less plastic, especially when it comes to water bottles, food containers, and clothing. Choose reusable glass receptacles, bring your own to-go boxes to restaurants, and buy garments made with natural fibers. You can also wash your apparel with powdered detergent — and without fabric softener — and use wool dryer balls.\n\nWhen it comes to eating, whole foods are generally cleaner than processed options.\n\nDo you worry about having toxic forever chemicals in your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "CASABLANCA, Morocco (AP) — Exposure to freezing temperatures near Morocco’s border with Algeria killed nine African migrants, a tragedy that rights groups in the North African country called deeply concerning and a violation of the right to freedom of movement.\n\nThe bodies of seven men and two women were found in Ras Asfour, a remote mountainous Moroccan area known for its plunging temperatures in winter, the Moroccan Association of Human Rights said Saturday in a statement.\n\n“They died from extreme cold, which their exhausted bodies could not withstand,” it said.\n\nOne of the migrants was from Guinea, the group said. The rest were from various countries throughout sub-Saharan Africa, though specific information about their identities remains unknown. Morocco’s Interior Ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the individuals who died.\n\nEvery year, thousands of migrants seeking better living conditions attempt to crossing illegal from North Africa to Europe, including from Morocco to Spain. Some aim for Ceuta and Melilla – two tiny Spanish enclaves in North Africa – by scaling border fences or swimming. Others attempt to reach Spain’s Canary Islands, taking a longer route through the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe North African nation’s security forces regularly report blocking such attempts.\n\nThroughout Europe and Africa, North Africa is known as a transit point for migrants en route to Europe’s southern border.\n\nSecurity agreements with the European Union have strengthen authorities' ability to deter migration in North Africa. Many who originally intended to migrate to Europe spend months or years working informally — doing construction, agriculture or domestic work. Others rely on aid while waiting for opportunities to cross the Mediterranean Sea or Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThe Moroccan Association of Human Rights statement said six of the bodies were buried last week and two were kept at the request of their relatives. “We will make sure that this case is followed up on,” it said.\n\nThe Moroccan Organization of Human Rights — a different association — earlier this week called for the humanization of borders, the decriminalization of illegal migration and residence, and the creation of a mechanism to track missing migrants to prevent tragedies like the one in Ras Asfour.\n\nFollow AP’s global migration coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/migration",

    "fullText": "A bystander is being hailed as a national “hero” after a shocking mass shooting at an iconic beach in Sydney, Australia, that was hosting a Jewish event.\n\nGraphic scenes have emerged from Bondi Beach after at least 16 people were shot dead and 38 others were injured, local police confirmed. Among the casualties was Rabbi Eli Schlanger, the assistant rabbi at the Chabad of Bondi, a Chabad official told the New York Times.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy,” said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. He added: “An attack on Jewish Australians is an attack on every Australian.”\n\nThe two shooters were a 50-year-old man who was fatally shot by police and a 24-year-old man who suffered “critical injuries,” police said.\n\nGunfire was heard on the popular beachfront around 6:47 p.m. local time Sunday, authorities said. Witnesses told the Daily Mail that they saw two men exit a vehicle close to the waterfront and begin firing dozens of rounds at beachgoers.\n\nNSW Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said that more than 1,000 people were at the Hannukkah event at Archer Park on the northern end of the beach when the shooting took place. “As a result of the circumstances of the incident tonight, at 9:36 p.m. this evening, I declared this to be a terrorist incident,” Lanyon said.\n\nFootage widely shared on social media shows a bystander tackling one of the gunmen, wrestling the weapon from his hands, and then turning it back on him, forcing the attacker to retreat.\n\n“It’s the most unbelievable scene I’ve ever seen,” NSW Premier Chris Minns said in a late-night press conference. “Walking to a gunman… and singlehandedly disarming him, putting his own life at risk... that man is a genuine hero and I’ve got no doubt there are many, many people alive due to his bravery.\"\n\nExtraordinary vision reportedly taken from the scene of the Bondi Beach shooting appears to a show a man heroically tackling and disarming one of the shooters.\n\nVision circulating social media shows an unidentified bystander approaching the gunman, who had just discharged his… pic.twitter.com/GJIRYJcD0W\n\n— 10 News (@10NewsAU) December 14, 2025\n\nThe hero bystander was identified by relatives as 43-year-old Ahmed al Ahmed. His cousin told 7News that the dad of two was shot twice and will undergo surgery.\n\n“He’s in hospital and we don’t know exactly what’s going on inside,” said the cousin, identified by the outlet only as Mustafa.\n\n“We do hope he will be fine. He’s a hero 100 percent.”\n\nIn separate footage, two men can be seen standing on a passenger bridge while firing multiple shots into the parkland that surrounds the beach.\n\n“This cowardly act of terrifying violence is shocking and painful to see and represents some of our worst fears about terrorism in Sydney,” Minns added.\n\n“This attack was designed to target Sydney’s Jewish community on the first day of Hanukkah, what should have been a night of peace and joy celebrated in that community with families and supporters, has been shattered by this horrifying, evil attack.”\n\nBondi is an area of the city with a large Jewish population, and Sunday marks the first day of the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.\n\nA “Chanukah by the Sea” event, planned for Sunday, began at 5 p.m. local time on the beach where community members were set to light the first candle on a giant Menorah, enjoy a petting farm, and receive free face painting.\n\n“Join Chabad of Bondi for our Annual Chanukah Festival as We Celebrate Jewish Life by lighting up the Iconic Bondi Beach,” the event information page reads.\n\n“This is a targeted attack on Jewish Australians on the first day of Hanukkah, which should be a day of joy, a celebration of faith,” Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese added at the press conference. “This is an act of evil antisemitism terrorism that has struck the heart of our nation.”\n\n“Every Australian tonight will be like me, devastated over this attack on our way of life. There is no place for this hate, violence and terrorism in our nation. Let me be clear, we will eradicate it.”\n\nTension between community groups has been increasingly strained in Australia following the outbreak of the war in Gaza in 2023.\n\nSydney has been the site of numerous pro-Palestine protests, including one demonstration in August that saw an estimated 90-300,000 people march across the famous Harbour Bridge.\n\n“The events at Bondi Beach are an absolute atrocity. A horror for the victims and a massive escalation of the hatred directed at Australia’s Jewish community,” former conservative Prime Minister Tony Abbot said on X.\n\n“There should be no place in Australia for the kind of evil we’ve seen this evening,” he added. “Thank God one bystander heroically intervened showing the good side of our country.”\n\nBondi Beach is one of the world’s most iconic beaches and a central hub of Sydney life. With close proximity to the CBD, a vibrant community, and world-class surf, this waterfront neighbourhood is known for its luxury properties and upper-class living.\n\nOn Sunday evening, the beach was packed with holidaymakers and locals cooling off in the water from the 90-degree heat when the shooting began.\n\nVideo footage of the incident shows hundreds of people sprinting across the white sand for cover as shots ring out in the background.\n\nWitnesses say dozens of shots were fired, while other imagery shows bullets and casings from high-powered rifle weaponry on the floor.\n\n“For twenty minutes, they shoot, shoot. Change magazines and just shoot,” one Israeli eyewitness told a 7 News journalist who was on the scene.\n\n“It’s terrible. In the middle of Bondi. It’s terrible.”\n\nThis community is no stranger to tragedy. The Bondi neighborhood was the subject of a mass stabbing incident in April of last year, with six people stabbed to death and 12 people injured at the Westfield Bondi Junction shopping centre. That incident was not considered a terror attack.\n\nMass shootings are rare in Australia following the Port Arthur massacre in Tasmania in 1996 in which 35 people were shot dead and a further 23 wounded. In the immediate aftermath of that event, then Prime Minister John Howard implemented a mandatory firearm buyback scheme which saw 650,000 newly prohibited firearms removed from circulation in Australia.",

    "fullText": "Moneywise and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nConsumer confidence dropped sharply in November, falling to its lowest point since April, when concern over President Trump’s tariffs was driving economic anxiety (1).\n\nPossibly as a result, Americans have pulled back on spending. A delayed report from the Department of Commerce shows that while consumer spending rose 0.02% from the previous month, sales are sluggish compared to the 0.6% increase recorded in July and August and 1% increase in June (2).\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nApproaching retirement with no savings? Don’t panic, you're not alone. Here are 6 easy ways you can catch up (and fast)\n\nWhat are they doing with their money instead? New research from JPMorgan Chase's Institute of Financial Health and Wealth Creation found that after accounting for inflation, savings and checking balances have essentially been stagnant for nearly two years .\n\nWhen it comes to high-income households, bank balances have even been shrinking, landing at negative 2% in October 2025 (3).\n\nThe report notes that higher-income households are instead moving cash out of regular bank accounts and into higher-yield options, such as money market funds, brokerage accounts and certificates of deposit (CDs) (3).\n\nWith inflation hovering around 3.0% — well above the 2% target — it seems traditional accounts just aren’t cutting it (4).\n\nWith incomes barely improving and everyday costs still high, many consumers now have “just enough to spend but not enough to splurge,” which explains why spending is falling.\n\nRather than spending more, many households are turning to investment-style options with higher returns for their cash. If you're thinking about doing the same, here are some of the most popular alternatives:\n\nThese function like regular savings accounts but offer much higher interest rates. For example, a SoFi checking and savings account can help you build your wealth base through a combination of high-interest rates, zero fees and ease of access.\n\nA SoFi account can provide a base 3.60% APY, but new clients can get a 0.70% boost for up to 6 months for a total APY of 4.30%. That’s over ten times the national deposit savings rate, according to the FDIC’s November report.",

    "fullText": "If you needed a sign for how determined AI-land is to achieve AGI quickly, it's that one of its leaders sees the speed of human typing as one of its biggest roadblocks.\n\nAlexander Embiricos, who leads product development for Codex, OpenAI's coding agent, said on \"Lenny's Podcast\" on Sunday that the \"current underappreciated limiting factor\" to AGI is \"human typing speed\" or \"human multi-tasking speed on writing prompts.\"\n\nAGI, or artificial general intelligence, is a still theoretical version of AI that reasons as well or better than humans. It's the thing all the big AI companies are competing to be the first to realize.\n\n\"You can have an agent watch all the work you're doing, but if you don't have the agent also validating its work, then you're still bottlenecked on, like, can you go review all that code?\" Embiricos said.\n\nEmbiricos' view is that we need to unburden humans from having to write prompts and validate AI's work, since we aren't fast enough.\n\n\"If we can rebuild systems to let the agent be default useful, we'll start unlocking hockey sticks,\" he said.\n\n\"Hockey stick growth\" is a term used to describe a growth curve that starts out flat and suddenly spikes, mirroring the shape of a hockey stick.\n\nEmbiricos said there's no simple path to a fully automated workflow — each use case will require its own approach — but he expects to see progress toward this level of growth soon.\n\n\"Starting next year, we're going to see early adopters starting to hockey stick their productivity, and then over the years that follow, we're going to see larger and larger companies hockey stick that productivity,\" he said.\n\nSomewhere in between the time early adopters start to see gains in productivity and when tech giants manage to fully automate processes with AI agents is when we'll see AGI, Embiricos said.\n\n\"That hockey-sticking will be flowing back into the AI labs, and that's when we'll basically be at the AGI,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "A 1,000-strong \"dark fleet\" of rogue oil tankers skirting sanctions has emerged as a new target for the U.S. and Ukraine, a senior maritime intelligence analyst claims.\n\nMichelle Wiese Bockmann warned the aging fleet poses geopolitical risks and threats of $1 billion oil spills, with the recent U.S. seizures in Venezuela and Ukrainian drone strikes in the Black Sea marking a turning point for both nations in their efforts.\n\n\"There are about 1,000 vessels worldwide that are trading sanctioned crude tankers containing sanctioned Iranian, Venezuelan and Russian oil,\" Bockmann told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"These vessels are a lifeline for these regimes, because they’re used for shipping oil to fund the war in Ukraine, and also give money to the illicit Maduro regime,\" she added.\n\nIran Backs Maduro To Keep Latin America Foothold As Trump Increases Pressure On Venezuela\n\n\"This is a brand-new problem for the U.S., and now Ukraine has signaled they are going to target these vessels the same way,\" she said. \"There is a new strategy to deal with this dark fleet, which is the lifeline of sanctioned oil revenues, and now under attack by the U.S. and Ukraine. The strategy is all to counter what we call gray-zone aggression.\"\n\nUs Escalation With Maduro Halts Deportation Flights To Venezuela\n\nRecent Ukrainian naval drone strikes have disabled several tankers in the Black Sea, including the Dashan, part of Russia’s so-called shadow fleet that Ukraine says helps Moscow export oil in defiance of sanctions, according to Reuters.\n\n\"It is dangerous and could be interpreted as a form of gray-zone aggression in order to continue to keep oil revenue flowing,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"This is all a billion-dollar oil spill catastrophe waiting to happen,\" she added, pointing to the environmental and navigational risks posed by poorly maintained, uninsured ships.\n\nVenezuela Mobilizes Troops, Weapons In Response To Us Warship Buildup In Caribbean\n\nShe said a subset of \"about 350 to 400 vessels at any one time are not only sanctioned but falsely flying flags, which is dangerous,\" because false registration leaves vessels stateless and uninsured, putting crews at risk.\n\n\"This is a huge issue for maritime safety, it’s a menace to the environment, and it entails crew welfare,\" Bockmann said.\n\nThese vessels, she said, are typically \"elderly\" and used solely for sanctioned oil trades. Many also \"manipulate AIS\" to show they are in one place when they are actually elsewhere.\n\nTrump Sends World's Most Powerful Warship To Latin America — Historic Echoes Of Regime Change\n\n\"They use false flagging, but also spoofing and manipulating its AIS to show it's in one place when it's not. These vessels have also gone to fraudulent registries that don't exist, which means they have no insurance,\" she said. \"Their certificates of seaworthiness are invalid, and they have relied on international maritime conventions to have what's called the ‘right of innocent passage’ so they can't get intercepted.\"\n\nBockmann said U.S. forces have used legal tools including Article 110 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which allows boarding of stateless vessels, to stop these ships.\n\n\"It's my belief that they used Article 110, and they got on board that vessel, and they were absolutely entitled to remove that vessel from global trade,\" she said.\n\nVenezuela Accuses Us Of 'Piracy' After Seizing Massive Oil Tanker\n\nIn the Caribbean, U.S. forces recently seized the tanker Skipper, sanctioned in 2022 and found to be masking its location, under a federal warrant as part of a broader campaign to disrupt illicit oil shipping.\n\n\"The recent Venezuelan tanker was carrying 1.8 million barrels of oil uninsured, so that's a billion-dollar maritime disaster waiting to happen,\" Bockmann said.\n\nAs reported by Fox News Digital, Dec. 12 saw Attorney General Pam Bondi frame the U.S. seizure of a Venezuelan crude tanker as a sanctions-enforcement action rooted in a federal court warrant.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Black Sea, Ukraine targeted multiple alleged \"shadow fleet\" tankers with sea drones, according to Reuters.\n\n\"The three tankers that have been targeted by Ukraine are all in ballast, which means that they weren't carrying oil,\" Bockmann said.\n\n\"That was carefully chosen, and they were also falsely flagged, just like in the recent case of the three tankers attacked in Ukraine. That flag was Gambia. In the U.S. case of Skipper, the flag was Guyana,\" Bockmann said.\n\nFox News Digital's Morgan Phillips contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article",

    "title": "All my kids have grown up, so we've changed our holiday traditions. We scaled back on decorations and added a day of festivities.",
    "description": "As our blended family grew, our holiday traditions shifted — from expanding Christmas to embracing new rituals that match who our kids are today.",
    "fullText": "Cookie baking, decorating, stuffing stockings, building a holiday village scene with Iron Man and Thor action figures — just like a huggable snowman discovered, everyone has traditions for that time of year.\n\nWe're a blended family with kids ranging in age from 17 to mid-30s. As our kids have moved from being wide awake at 5:30 am to testing Santa to creating their own holiday magic as adults, our traditions have grown and changed with them. As a result, it's all less stressful.\n\nRight around Thanksgiving, I am reminded that it's not just wonderful, it's also a wacky and wearisome time of the year.\n\nI grew up in blended families. By middle school, both of my parents had remarried, doubling the number of families to see during the festive season. By the fifth stop on a whirlwind Christmas Day in high school, my brother and I were stuffed with cookies and even burned out on opening presents.\n\nFor most of our 20-year marriage, I've felt like I'm reliving those teenage years all over again as we try to squeeze in his family, my multiple families, and the kids' other family commitments into two overstuffed days of festive cheer.\n\nAs the kids got older and added commitments to their significant others and time for their own families, we realized Christmas is too short. Two days were just not enough time to cram in all the festivities and have at least a little time left for our family.\n\nSo, some years, we celebrate what we call \"Christmas Tweve,\" the day before Christmas Eve. We spend most of the day hanging out, having a festive feast, and then opening gifts. Sometimes we have a houseful overnight, and everyone stays up late watching Christmas movies and eating my feeble attempts at pancake art for breakfast.\n\nWe are down to two kids living at home, and the number of holiday decorations has reduced.\n\nOne year, we had multiple trees, each decorated in a different theme — a candy-themed 5-foot tree, a mini tree in the kids' rooms, and a fancy ornament 7-foot tree.\n\nThere were two Christmas villages, one in the kitchen. The kitchen and living room looked like Christmas exploded in them. Every room had a few decorations — a tree, figurines, holiday towels, and a wreath on the door.\n\nThere was a time when seven of us were decorating. Now it's down to four, and we're focusing more on the nostalgic and sentimental decorations. Our tree is covered in ornaments from places we've traveled and the kids created.\n\nI used to frame the sliding door in our kitchen with the kids' artwork - cotton-ball snowmen, sparkly handprint reindeer, and a painted winter scene.\n\nA few years ago, my youngest and I had a holiday moment of tension when I displayed elementary school artwork with their previous name. They're nonbinary, and it bothered them seeing that name plastered all over the kitchen.\n\nI got creative and modified my favorites — erasing letters, trimming corners, and folding back edges. Now I display favorites onl,y and it's down to one wall shared with our Advent calendar.\n\nWhen the kids were younger, we had multiple Advent calendars — one with treats and one with toys. One year, it was Disney Tsum Tsums, there was \"Star Wars\" Lego, and then socks. A few years ago, no one was really interested, and we got one for the dog.\n\nNow, our Advent calendar is a meaningful tradition. It's the same one each year, and this year, my youngest helped shop for the candy, hopefully marking the start of a new tradition.\n\nWhen she was in college, my stepdaughter started making an annual ornament with a silly picture of herself. The perfect gift on a tight budget — inexpensive and very meaningful.\n\nNow she's a mom, married, and decorating her own place. Every year, my husband, the two youngest kids, and I put all 11 ornaments she's created on the tree — her with Chipotle burritos, in a snow globe, and with her son.\n\nA few years ago, our oldest came to stay when his spouse was out of town. I put him and his two younger siblings in charge of the holiday village.\n\nWhen I heard my youngest rummaging through their toys, I knew the holiday village was going to have a different vibe than it had in past years. Lego minifigs, Power Rangers, and assorted superheroes perched on festive rooftops and hid in the snow.\n\nEvery stage of our kids' lives means something new. Sometimes it's capped with a major milestone, such as a driver's license, wedding, or graduation, as a reminder to stop and savor this time.\n\nWith the holidays, there wasn't a big event to mentally prepare for the change. Gradually, things were different — gone were the days of classroom holiday party crafts and a big group decorating the tree. Now it's crafts from doggy day care, Christmas Tweve, and Spider-Man in the village. And I love it.",

    "description": "The cheapest ticket to attend the USA's opening 2026 World Cup match against Paraguay is $1,120 — a steep jump from initial estimates shared in 2018.",
    "fullText": "It's been over 30 years since Americans have had the chance to watch their national soccer team play on their home turf.\n\nThey'll get another chance next year, but it'll cost them.\n\nFans could pay over $2,700 for a ticket to watch the USA's first match in the 2026 FIFA World Cup against Paraguay, which is scheduled to take place in June at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California.\n\nThat far exceeds the estimated ticket prices included in the original joint bid submitted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico to host the World Cup.\n\nFIFA, which sets ticket prices, says it is using variable pricing to determine ticket costs, and \"may adjust ticket prices throughout the sales phases based on a review of demand and availability for each match.\"\n\nThe organization said it isn't using dynamic pricing — when ticket prices change in real time based on demand and other factors — for the 2026 World Cup. In addition to third-party sites like StubHub, which sell tickets, FIFA offers a resale and exchange marketplace for fans.\n\nFIFA launched its third phase of ticketing last week. Soon after the portal opened, fans took to social media, expressing shock over what they described as steep prices.\n\nWorld Cup tickets are divided into four categories, with Category 1 selling the most expensive tickets and Category 4 the cheapest options.\n\nAs of Saturday, there are no available Category 4 tickets for the USA's opening match against Paraguay on June 12. Instead, the cheapest ticket is selling for $1,120 under Category 3. The most expensive ticket costs $2,735, followed by $1,940.\n\nThe most expensive ticket for Mexico's opening match against South Africa costs $2,355, and Canada's opening match costs $2,170. Neither of those matches is offering Category 4 tickets.\n\nAs the tournament continues, ticket prices drop but are typically still far above original estimates.\n\nWhen the USA faces off against Australia on June 19, the most affordable ticket is $265, while the most expensive is selling for $700. When the USA plays on June 25, fans will have to pay between $910 and $340.\n\nThose prices are a far cry from what the United States, Canada, and Mexico estimated in their bid to host the tournament. The countries submitted a combined bid — dubbed the \"United bid\" — and were selected in 2018.\n\nIn their pitch, the countries estimated that a Category 1 ticket for an opening match would cost $774, followed by $614 for Category 2, $320 for Category 3, and $60 for Category 4.\n\nTickets for the final match were estimated to cost between $1,550 and $128. Under FIFA, the current final match prices — held at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey — start at $4,185. The most costly ticket is $8,680.\n\nDespite the hefty price, fans eager to snag tickets in this phase can purchase them now until January 13.\n\nThe 23rd edition of the tournament will take place this summer in 16 cities across North America. The first game kicks off on June 11, and teams will play until the final match on July 19.",

    "description": "\"Mighty Nein\" is the Critical Role crew's second animated series project with Amazon.",
    "fullText": "The eight cofounders of the nerdworld business Critical Role came roaring back to Prime Video with the November debut of \"The Mighty Nein.\"\n\nThe business's eight cofounders first started out streaming their home \"Dungeons & Dragons\" game on Twitch. Then, in 2019, CR raised seed funding of over $11.3 million to create the animated series \"The Legend of Vox Machina.\"\n\n\"The Mighty Nein,\" based on their second Twitch-streamed \"D&D\" campaign, is their second animated series on Prime Video.\n\nIn an interview with Business Insider in November, the cofounders outlined some of the biggest challenges they faced — and the lessons they learned — making the show.\n\n\"The largest challenge was trying to figure out how we were going to reorganize, and how we introduced the world,\" Critical Role CEO Travis Willingham said.\n\nConverting a 141-episode campaign into a show for Prime Video meant covering lots of on-stream ground, Willingham said. The team had to make a \"massive shift\" in how characters and plot points were introduced.\n\n\"For us, the livestream campaign was so good at sort of feeding one little nugget at a time, and the world got bigger and bigger and bigger. We thought it was far more effective to just hit you with the larger pieces at play and let those things sort of inform the characters and the storylines as you go along,\" Willingham added.\n\nWillingham said these hints set the stage for more developments down the road.\n\n\"We are going to sort of peel back the layers of that onion as we go along,\" Willingham said. \"But we are certainly taking our time and saving things for season two as well. So we're not in a rush.\"\n\nCofounder Sam Riegel told Business Insider that the crew's longtime game master, Matthew Mercer, had created an \"incredible continent filled with politics and socioeconomic strife and war, and ruin, and religious exploration.\"\n\n\"To show all of the antagonists, the villains, the political intrigue that's going on around our characters, we needed a whole other plot line to show what was going on in the background,\" Riegel said.\n\nRiegel added that another key challenge with the \"Mighty Nein\" was the complexity of some of the main characters' backstories.\n\n\"We don't want to throw all those backstories in the audience's face right at the top, but we do want to tease out that they come with baggage and trauma and issues that they have to work through,\" Riegel said.\n\n\"Luckily, we were afforded hourlong episodes in which to do so, and I think it paints a rich tapestry,\" Riegel said.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercer wove in information and plot points from the campaign that even Twitch viewers back in the day weren't aware of. That included more information on the series' key antagonists, the wizard Volstruckers, and the mysterious and enigmatic academic, Essek Thelyss, whom Mercer voices.\n\n\"We had the opportunity to dig in with the writer's rooms and the rest of the creative team to collaborate on how best to see that now fleshed out and shown and explored with the audience through this animated series,\" Mercer said. \"So there weren't too many changes. A lot of it was mainly just taking what was there or things that were sitting in my head and going, 'Alright, now we get to actually show this. That's really cool and exciting. Let's do it.'\"\n\nOne of the big challenges the team had to overcome was articulating the intricate aspects of an in-game world through animation. And that spanned character costumes and memorable campaign locations.\n\n\"When I sent Matt (Mercer) my idea of where Jester grew up and what the Lavish Chateau was, I had this strong visual in my mind,\" cofounder and cast member Laura Bailey said, referring to her character, the trickster cleric Jester.\n\n\"And then to see it in the animated series, it's so strange that they can capture exactly what it was that we've visualized for so long, and now everybody else gets to see these stunning set pieces that have existed only in this little world,\" Bailey added.\n\nCofounder Taliesin Jaffe said that he'd been \"very, very specific\" as well about how the carnival his character, Mollymauk Tealeaf, traveled with — should be animated.\n\n\"I'm famous for making very easy-to-animate character designs — I say deeply sarcastically,\" Jaffe joked.\n\nThe Critical Role team also had to look into how each character's magic was represented on-screen. For Liam O'Brien, it was crucial that his wizard, Caleb Widogast, cast magic in a manner that resembled a \"learned science,\" complete with alchemy and specific components.\n\nThe crew, O'Brien said, was also just happy to have the \"luxury of time\" to go back and revisit moments from their old \"D&D\" campaign.\n\n\"I am in love with the complicated world that this show has created — and that Sam and Travis have helmed — as we've all, in an all-hands effort, just created everything with love,\" O'Brien said.",

    "description": "Leon Spencer, an Australian dad, wants his kids to meet up with friends in person, not become products for advertisers.",
    "fullText": "The number of times my 11-year-old daughter has asked to join Messenger Kids has jumped noticeably this year.\n\nI've always believed I had good grounds to refuse, but to her, it's just a way to chat with friends. What's the harm? I've tried explaining how one app can lead to others, and how dependence on digital platforms can form quickly at her age.\n\nNow, with Australia's new ban on certain social media platforms for kids under 16, I can point to something more concrete: It's against the law.\n\nHere's the thing, though: the Messenger Kids platform isn't actually banned under the new legislation. Not yet anyway, even if its older sibling, Facebook, is. But the social media ban provides parents like me with a new reference point that normalizes our decision to say no.\n\nI'm not a Luddite. As an editorial lead for a media and communications agency in Australia, I work with content designed for social media platforms. Technology is key to what I do, and I understand the value of it, including social media platforms.\n\nBut we all know these apps are designed to be addictive and to keep users — including children — scrolling. Research increasingly shows links to declining mental health and even potential effects on brain development.\n\nI was concerned that the peer pressure to allow my children to join social media could make the decision to say no much harder than it ought to be. I'm hoping the ban will make it easier.\n\nI have two kids, 11 and 8. I don't want them to get into the habit of using social media platforms to interact with friends. I want them meeting friends in person or calling them, not becoming products for advertisers.\n\nMy children sometimes use my WhatsApp account for video calls with friends and family. Occasionally, they'll watch an Instagram reel with Mum on her phone. But I think it's important for most of their peer group interaction to occur at playdates, at school, or around the local neighborhood.\n\nI live on the Sunshine Coast, in Queensland, a part of Australia that lends itself to a rich outdoor lifestyle, year-round. It's easy for me to let my kids walk down the street to the park or visit friends nearby without constant adult supervision.\n\nAmong the other parents I speak with, the ban is a welcome shift in our relationship with social media platforms.\n\nTaking social media out of the equation completely also means less overall screen time. I'm good with this. Less screen time means less passive consumption and more active play. Yes, my kids get bored. But wait a little while, and they always find interesting things to do.\n\nRecently, after complaining for the better part of an hour about having to turn off the TV, my kids took themselves off and created a play. They wrote a script, rehearsed the lines, dressed in costumes, and performed.\n\nIt wouldn't have happened if the screen had stayed on.",

    "description": "Heath Kitson and William Lu planned a trip to Bali to learn surfing after getting laid off from their bank jobs.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Heath Kitson and William Lu, who worked at ANZ Bank in the company's Melbourne office. The essay has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nHeath Kitson: I managed a team of data analysts, and I was at ANZ for seven years before I was laid off a couple of months ago.\n\nWilliam Lu: I was at the bank for eleven years, and I reported to Heath.\n\nI've always said to people that it's been one of my dreams to be made redundant and enjoy some time off, but when it actually happens, it hits you hard. Part of me still thought that maybe I should just try to make an effort to find another role here. But then, toward the end of the consultation process, I had this overwhelming feeling, like Heath, that the change of strategy and direction meant that the exciting work we were doing was now over. It felt like a time to reset.\n\nKitson: We both got generous payouts, and the layoff did not hit us financially, and won't for a while. But it's definitely been a change — ever since I started work 20 years ago, I haven't even been out of work for even two weeks.\n\nLu: I haven't dived into looking for other roles yet. I'm fairly confident in the networks I have and the people I know, so I'm sure I'll be able to find somewhere warmer to go.\n\nKitson: Our outplacement service had a recruiter who had spent his career talking to executives in my position. He said that job hunting is a very deflating experience.\n\nHis advice was not to try to job hunt for eight hours a day and really grind yourself down, only to arrive at an interview all flat and disillusioned. He suggested spending only two hours a day looking for work and using the rest of the time to do whatever would make me feel happy and refreshed. He said we should be signaling to future employers: 'I'm the freshest I've ever been, I can't wait to start, I'm back from a trip.'\n\nIt reinforced to me that a break was not just part of the long service leave that was given to me, but also something that would help me get my next role. Even when I've changed jobs in the past, the companies have wanted me to start right away.\n\nLu: My outplacement experience wasn't as profound. My guy started the motions and informed me about the services available to me and the workshops I should attend. I was the one to say: 'Hold on, I'm not ready to think about this yet. Can we reconvene in February?'\n\nThe longest break I've had was when I went on my wedding and honeymoon, which lasted three weeks, so this period of paid leave was very welcome.\n\nKitson: When I started looking into how I wanted to spend my break, I knew I wanted to do something active. So I was thinking skiing, hiking, surfing, or those CrossFit camps. The goal was to find something that energizes me and to come back in better shape than when I left. I did not want to sit around drinking or being hungover for seven days and coming back more tired.\n\nLu: Heath and I had never hung out outside work at this point, but we were on a call one day after we were let go, when Heath shared that he wanted to go somewhere but did not have someone to go with. I told him that my wife also suggested taking a trip, and I would be up to go with him. We were just exchanging ideas when a surf camp in Bali came up.\n\nFor me, it was about experiencing something new as well. I've been surfing before, but to go seven days straight and have the opportunity to actually develop that skill properly, I think that was probably what got me over the line.\n\nKitson: I probably would've come on my own if we couldn't have worked something out together. But part of the appeal of this place was that we were coming to a community where we'd meet other people.\n\nLu: It didn't take too much to convince me, but the thought did cross my mind if it was a really good idea to travel with my ex-boss. But we've always had a good relationship and a lot in common.\n\nKitson: We just got back from our first session this morning, and I felt like I was not thinking about things back home and could focus on the waves. I've had a couple of sleepless nights over the past few weeks, but I think I'll sleep well tonight.\n\nLu: I wasn't thinking about work either. When part of you is just slightly worried about drowning, I don't think you can really think about too much.\n\nKitson: Our families were pretty happy to have us out of the house, since we'd gone pretty stir crazy. From friends and other coworkers, there was a little bit of friendly jealousy when they heard, and quite a few people wanted to come along. Lots of people asked us when we're doing the next one.\n\nLu: It's only our first day here, but I definitely could come again. There was quite a bit of work leading up to it, like getting visas and SIM cards. But as soon as we got on the plane, I was completely relaxed.\n\nKitson: I've thought already that if I get a job offer with a longer runway, I would go and do something similar again. I like that at surf camp, my day-to-day schedule is planned, and I can switch off about where to go and having to cook or go out to eat. It's different from a family beach vacation, which lacks this sense of freedom and rest because you're planning your own schedule and looking after the kids.\n\nLu: It's the same for me, since it's usually me who does all the planning.\n\nKitson: I'd suggest that anyone in a similar situation maintain their routines back home, but also try to take a short, refreshing break like this while waiting for things to happen on the job front.\n\nAre you based in Asia-Pacific and have a story to share about dealing with layoffs?

    "description": "The bankruptcy announcement comes after cash struggles and a failed acquisition by Amazon.",
    "fullText": "The parent company of Roomba, which has sold millions of cleaning robots, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Sunday after 35 years of operation.\n\nIn a Sunday press release, Massachusetts-based robotics company iRobot said it had filed for bankruptcy protection in the District of Delaware court.\n\nThe company said that it would be wholly acquired by its main manufacturer and lender, vacuum cleaner maker Shenzhen PICEA. Picea has R&D and manufacturing facilities in China and Vietnam, per the release.\n\nThe Picea deal would allow iRobot to continue operating, developing new products, make \"timely payments to vendors and creditors,\" and meet its commitments to employees, the release said.\n\nUnder the deal, iRobot will be a private company owned by Picea, and its common stock will be wiped from stock exchanges.\n\niRobot was founded in 1990 by three roboticists from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The company introduced the Roomba, its iconic disc-shaped vacuuming robot, in 2002.\n\nThe bankruptcy deal follows several quarters of weak sales and a cash crunch. The company wrote in its third-quarter earnings report that, as of September 27, its cash totaled $24.8 million, compared to $40.6 million as of June 28.\n\niRobot said it had withdrawn $5 million in restricted cash on September 27, after which it had \"no sources upon which it can draw for additional capital.\"\n\nIts third-quarter revenue, $145.8 million, was about a 25% drop compared to the same period the year before, with sales dropping 33% in the US.\n\nLast month, the company warned that the last possible iRobot buyer had backed out of a deal, which left it likely to pursue bankruptcy.\n\niRobot went through a failed acquisition attempt by Amazon. In 2022, Amazon announced that it would buy iRobot for $1.7 billion, but pulled the deal in January 2024, citing regulatory hurdles in the US and Europe.\n\nThe collapse of the Amazon deal hit iRobot hard. On the same day as Amazon's announcement, iRobot said it would lay off 31% of its staff, and its CEO, Colin Angle, would step down.\n\niRobot's stock price has dropped more than 50% in the past year and more than 90% in the past five years.",

No safety driver.Fully autonomous.This is actually happening. pic.twitter.com/MSmRaeyJwj\n\nAccording to Robotaxi Tracker — run by Austin-based robotaxi watcher Ethan McKenna — there are 31 active vehicles in Austin, up from 29 in November. Speaking on the \"All-In\" podcast in October, Musk said that Tesla was aiming to increase its robotaxi fleet to 500 cars in Austin by the end of the year.\n\nMusk said in a video call at an xAI \"hackathon\" event last week that Tesla would remove human safety monitors from its robotaxi cars by the end of the year, according to Teslarati, a news site focused on Musk-run companies.\n\n\"There will be Tesla robotaxis operating in Austin with no one in them, not even anyone in the passenger seat, in about three weeks,\" Musk said, the outlet reported.\n\nWhen Business Insider tested a robotaxi in Austin in July, it required multiple interventions from the safety monitor in the passenger seat, including at one point when the car went the wrong way on a one-way street.\n\nTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Jennifer McGuire was afraid of waiting around for her four adult sons to visit, so she booked a solo trip to Italy, France, and Northern Ireland.",
    "fullText": "I never used to know what kind of pizza I liked. A small but strangely telling detail about my life.\n\nI was always the adult ordering for me and my four sons — usually an extra-large cheese, maybe pepperoni if I felt wild. Economical crowd-pleasers. Perfect for our family, and for a single mom who didn't have the time to think about her own preferences.\n\nMaybe that's part of why I moved to Europe alone after my youngest left for college. I wanted to figure out what I liked on my pizza.\n\nOf course, it was more than that. I'd romanticized long stretches in Europe for years. I used to dream about Italy and France when I was deep in the trenches of motherhood, when a trip to the grocery store felt like an expedition, and the school parking lot was as far as I ever got.\n\nEurope felt impossibly distant from our small town. At that point in my life, even getting to the airport felt too far.\n\nBut when the time came, as afraid as I was to go, I was more afraid of staying put — of waiting for my kids to visit so I could feel like a person again.\n\nDetermined not to let fear stop me, I booked my first flight to Rome with my tax return. I packed my laptop so I could work remotely, a blessing that meant I could rent a place of my own.\n\nFirst, a tiny studio in the old town of Tivoli, just outside Rome. Then a month in Avignon in the south of France. Then Belfast in Northern Ireland. My choices were based almost entirely on friends' recommendations and the cheapest monthly Airbnbs I could find. I knew so little about the world beyond our house in Canada. I just wanted to go and see.\n\nFor the next six months, I learned how to be a person in the world without my \"mom\" qualifier. I learned how to make friends on my own — not mom friends or work friends, but actual friends.\n\nIn Italy, I joined a local hiking group and met a woman who became my closest Italian friend. Every day we walked and translated for each other until my Italian improved. Another shock: learning a new language in middle age.\n\nI felt foolish and more like myself at the same time.\n\nI walked everywhere. I learned how to be quiet inside — riding trains, gazing out the windows, wandering through museums, and drinking wine.\n\nIn the mornings, I took my coffee to the local courtyard to watch kids play soccer, women fill water at the fountain, and men play bocce. I embraced every cliché without a hint of embarrassment.\n\nI missed my kids, enough that I considered flying home at least a dozen times. But missing them somewhere new felt easier than missing them in our small town. Back home, I felt left behind. Leaving for my own adventure made me feel like I was choosing myself again.\n\nWhen I left Italy for Avignon, something softened. I already spoke a little French, which helped, and the city itself was easy to navigate. Each café and tiny shop felt like a gentle invitation.\n\nI met empty-nester moms everywhere — women who linked arms on their way to lunch and insisted I come along. They were building new lives while keeping their children at the center of their attention. I recognized myself in them.\n\nThat's what I learned in those six months: I could build a new life, return to an old version of myself, and still carry my mother-ness with me. I could be all of those people at once. I could still grow.\n\nIn Belfast, I wrote. I hiked Cave Hill with new friends and often by myself. I took a bus to the Giant's Causeway and ate fish chowder by the sea.\n\nEach day I chose something new and something familiar — yoga classes in the Cathedral Quarter, music nights at the Sunflower Pub, a book by the fire in White's Tavern on Sunday afternoons.\n\nAnd I wrote and wrote and wrote — an entire book — because finally I had the time and the quiet to write one. Because I felt like I was stepping into my own life for the first time in a long time.\n\nAt the end of my trip, I flew my sons over for a two-week visit. We went back to Rome, and I showed them everything — the Trevi Fountain, the Spanish Steps, all the obvious highlights. But more than that, I introduced them to the woman I'd become. A mom, yes, but also a friend, a hiker, a writer.\n\nAnd a lover of all kinds of pizza.\n\nDo you have a story about taking a gap year that you want to share?

    "description": "In a lawsuit challenging an Australian law barring children under 16 from having social media accounts, Reddit argues it's not a social media company.",
    "fullText": "A new law barring children under 16 from opening or maintaining social media accounts took effect last week in Australia, forcing platforms to deactivate accounts for swaths of young users.\n\nIn the words of Taylor Swift, however, Reddit would very much like to be excluded from this narrative because, it says, it's not a social media platform.\n\nReddit made the argument in a lawsuit it filed against the Commonwealth of Australia and its Minister of Communications on Friday. The Australian law is meant to protect young people from what it says are the harmful and addictive effects of social media use.\n\nReddit is seeking to overturn the country's new law, which it says \"infringes the implied freedom of political communication.\"\n\nAs part of the legal filing, Reddit also pushed back at being labeled an \"age-restricted social media platform\" within the meaning of Australia's law.\n\nInstead, Reddit said it \"operates as a collection of public fora arranged by subject.\"\n\n\"That is because it is not the case that the sole purpose, or a significant purpose, of Reddit is to enable 'online social interaction' between two or more end-users,\" the company said in its 12-page legal filing.\n\nThe company added that, in most cases, users don't know each other's real identities.\n\n\"Reddit does not import contact lists or address books. The 'upvote/downvote' functionality enables users to indicate how helpful they found the information that was posted by an end-user,\" the company said in the lawsuit. \"It is not intended to be used as a way for users to express any view about the poster themselves. In this way, Reddit is significantly different from other sites that allow for users to become 'friends' with one another, or to post photos about themselves, or to organise events.\"\n\nReddit, founded in 2005, allows users to post and reply to those posts on \"subreddits\" dedicated to almost any topic imaginable. Users have the option to upvote or downvote posts and can send each other direct messages. While Reddit users can use their real names, most of them operate anonymously.\n\nThe company went public in 2024 with a valuation of $6.4 billion.\n\nReddit elaborated on its argument in a statement addressed to its users, which was shared on the platform last week.\n\n\"This law is applied to Reddit inaccurately, since we're a forum primarily for adults and we don't have the traditional social media features the government has taken issue with,\" the company said in the statement.\n\nAustralia's new law, which would place the onus on social media platforms to verify users' ages, has drawn criticism from other companies it targets as well, such as TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, and Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram.\n\nReddit, which says it is complying with the law, told its users that doing so could have unintended consequences.\n\n\"This law has the unfortunate effect of forcing intrusive and potentially insecure verification processes on adults as well as minors, isolating teens from the ability to engage in age-appropriate community experiences (including political discussions), and creating an illogical patchwork of which platforms are included and which aren't,\" the company said.\n\nAustralia isn't the only country considering restricting social media use among young people.\n\nMalaysia plans to ban children under 16 from having social media accounts in 2026. In Norway and Denmark, lawmakers have proposed laws that would ban social media accounts for children under 15.\n\nA handful of US senators earlier this year introduced the Kids Off Social Media Act, which would bar social media platforms from allowing children under 13 years old to create or maintain accounts. The act would also bar platforms from using algorithms to target children under 17.\n\n\"Australia is stepping up to protect kids from the addictive and harmful content being constantly fed to them on social media. It's now time for Congress to do the same and pass the Kids Off Social Media Act,\" Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii, a Democrat, said in a statement to Business Insider.",

    "fullText": "The person of interest detained in connection with the Brown University shooting, identified by law enforcement sources as Benjamin Erickson, is a decorated soldier who had served in a position at Arlington National Cemetery, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n\nErickson, a 24-year-old Wisconsin native, served as an infantry soldier in the US Army, where he passed sniper training, had experience with firearms instruction and had served as a rifleman between 2021 and 2024, according to the profile.\n\nErickson also received a good conduct medal, participated in “security duties” near the president and assisted with funeral ceremonies at Arlington, the profile stated.\n\nThe LinkedIn page stated he planned to continue his college education at Brown University in the fall 2025 semester.\n\nA spokesperson for the US Army said Erickson had no deployments and left last year with the rank of specialist. Brown University did not immediately respond to questions about Erickson’s record.\n\nAuthorities said the person of interest was not a current student at Brown, but law enforcement sources indicated to CNN that he might have been recently enrolled.\n\nErickson took online classes with a focus on psychology at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee after graduating from high school in July 2020, and then transferred to Brown for this fall semester after his military service ended, according to the profile, which noted a variety of interests including animal welfare, veteran support and helping the poor.\n\nThe profile further noted that he had interned as a carpenter and helped out at a horse rescue center.\n\nA staff member at the rescue, the Gentle Giants Draft Horse Rescue in Maryland, told CNN that Erickson was part of an Army unit that learned horse handling techniques at the rescue center between 2023 and 2024. Erickson was training with the Caisson Detachment of the US Army’s 3d US Infantry Regiment, the staff member said – a unit that provides escorts for military and state funerals.\n\nA high school yearbook included a photo of Erickson on his school’s wrestling team. A profile on X that appeared to belong to Erickson posted in 2016 and 2017 about wrestling, music and political satire.\n\nOne of Erickson’s former high school classmates, Bryce Jankowski, said he recently exchanged texts with Erickson, who said he was studying at Brown.\n\n“He said he was doing good,” Jankowski said. “He said he was living at a hotel because his apartment flooded,” though he said that did not seem to bother him.\n\nJankowski described Erickson as a well-behaved, smart individual. He did not recall Erickson making any concerning statements, harboring extremist views or having any behavioral challenges. “He was wicked smart.”\n\nAfter high school, he said Erickson had told him that he was in sniper school with the US military.\n\nA former wrestling teammate from high school, who asked not to be quoted by name, described Erickson as a “pretty nice guy, he was quiet… he becomes really outgoing when you get to know him, but he’s pretty quiet when you don’t.”\n\nOn Sunday afternoon, CNN observed the FBI at a Wisconsin home owned by Erickson’s family.\n\nA search of court databases showed no clear criminal history for Erickson aside from a 2023 case in which he was cited for driving on a sidewalk, a charge that was dismissed.\n\nCNN’s Bill Kirkos, Thomas Bordeaux and Jeff Winter contributed to this report.",

    "description": "No matter where you live relative to the Arctic, the discovery will likely impact you.",
    "fullText": "A research team examined how increasing Arctic rainfall is driving significant changes — and the implications hit closer to home than some might think.\n\nThe researchers used climate model simulations to study how sea-ice retreat impacts summer rainfall patterns. The results, published in Geophysical Research Letters, showed that rainfall would increase by 17% if global temperatures rise to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels, with 16% of the uptick attributed to sea-ice retreat.\n\nThis is because melting sea ice alters the \"white cold cap\" effect, weakening the region's ability to reflect solar radiation and thus pushing the Arctic toward a warmer, \"rain dominated\" water cycle, according to a Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS) analysis published in Phys.org.\n\nResearchers from the CAS' Northwest Institute of Eco-Environment and Resources, Beijing Normal University, and the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences also participated in the study.\n\nFirst author Yang Jiao explained that in the Arctic, animals that depend on sea ice for food and shelter, such as reindeer and polar bears, would \"face survival crises,\" per Phys.org. These crises would disrupt the region's ecological balance, which is vital for limiting disease spread and supporting the food web.\n\nAnd what happens in the Arctic wouldn't stay in the Arctic. Increased rainfall would accelerate permafrost thawing, releasing additional gases that warm the planet, per the study.\n\nWhile extreme weather phenomena occur naturally — and events can't be solely tied to a warming planet, as complex factors influence weather, per the NOAA — human activities are pumping billions of tons of heat-trapping gases into the atmosphere each year.\n\nThis has led to more intense extreme weather, according to scientific consensus. At home, this can mean sky-high insurance premiums, shortages of essential goods, and a higher risk of grid outages.\n\nThe researchers believe their insights into this critical climate issue could help in developing more accurate predictive models for Arctic weather.\n\n\"This study not only deepens our understanding of the warming and humidification processes in the Arctic, but also establishes a quantitative relationship model of 'sea ice-precipitation,' providing a powerful tool for enhancing the prediction capability of extreme weather and climate events in the Arctic,\" Yang said, per Phys.org.\n\nShould we be pouring money into nuclear fusion technology?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

In a statement on X on Sunday, he said subsequent investigations established he was \"deceived, and at no time did I act maliciously\".\n\nHe has not been prevented from continuing his career in football and has worked at seven clubs since the incident, including two in the Football League.\n\nBury, who play in the eighth-tier Northern Premier League Division One West, announced the 48-year-old's appointment on Friday.\n\nIt drew criticism on social media and Bury fans chanted for his removal as he watched Saturday's 2-1 win against Mossley in the stands at Gigg Lane. The away team's supporters also sang derogatory songs about him.\n\nIn a statement on Sunday, Bury said the club recognised \"the strength of feeling expressed in recent days by supporters, staff, partners and players, and the very real impact the board's decision to appoint Michael has had on individuals connected to the club\".\n\nThey included a statement from Jolley, which said: \"I do not wish my presence to deter the board from its mission of returning the club to its rightful place in the EFL.\"\n\nIn his statement on X, Jolley said his appointment had become a \"distraction\" for the club and he would \"relinquish the opportunity to become first-team manager\".\n\nBury said he had been \"relieved of his duties by mutual consent\".\n\nIn response, some fans called on board members to resign.\n\nBury said assistant manager Tim Lees would take charge of the side on an interim basis while the board undertakes \"a wider review of club operations\".\n\n\"We will also be engaging directly with players, staff and stakeholders to listen, learn and ensure that appropriate support is available,\" the club added.\n\n\"Our immediate priority is the welfare of our people and the stability of the club and our community.\n\n\"We believe this step is necessary to help restore confidence, create space for reflection and allow Bury FC to move forward in a way that reflects our values and responsibilities.\"\n\nThe club said it remained committed to \"acting with integrity, transparency and respect\".\n\nSamantha Harman - a Her Game Too ambassador for the club's supporters' group - said there had been no advance notice of Jolley's appointment.\n\n\"At the time the news was released, I was away with work and flew back immediately,\" Harman posted on X. \"I went straight to the game and made my feelings very clear to members of the board at the earliest possible opportunity.\n\n\"Since the announcement, I have had to manage the very real impact this decision has had on our volunteer base, including volunteers stepping down. This has been an extremely difficult situation to navigate.\n\n\"As volunteers, we are required to adhere to a social media policy, which limits our ability to publicly express personal feelings or opinions online.\n\n\"However, I want to be absolutely clear - the Her Game Too team at Bury FC was fully aligned with the concerns raised by supporters and did not stand by the decision made in this appointment.\"\n\nJolley was put in charge after Dave McNabb stepped down as manager earlier this month to become head of football operations.\n\nAnnouncing his appointment on Friday, a Bury statement said: \"Michael's blend of strategic expertise, coaching pedigree and global management experience makes him the right leader to inspire our squad and unite our supporters.\"\n\nIn his statement on X, Jolley said: \"I am grateful to have had the opportunity to work at seven fantastic professional clubs since 2009. On joining each of those clubs, I have always proactively raised this incident after being offered employment. All those clubs considered the evidence and reached their own judgement based on the facts.\n\n\"Now in 2025, 16 and a half years later, my CRB [Criminal Records Bureau] check has long since shown as clear but in the interests of transparency and openness, I still ensure that any prospective employers have visibility of the issue if I do receive any offer of employment, and I did so once again in my discussions with Bury FC.\n\n\"If prospective employers wish to view the evidence or character references that were heard in court in 2009, I also ensure these documents are made available to them.\n\n\"Football being what it is, I have become accustomed to being abused in stadia and online by people unwilling or unable to accept the facts. Since I have a clear conscience regarding the incident, I have always believed that it is right that I stand my ground in the face of the abuse I have received during my football career.\n\n\"However, now with a young family of my own who wish to attend matches and support the club, I naturally place their wellbeing above my own and take a different perspective on this issue.\"",

    "fullText": "On a weekend when Phil Foden and Cole Palmer helped Manchester City and Chelsea to vital Premier League victories, Aston Villa's Morgan Rogers showed just why he retains a firm grip on the number 10 position in Thomas Tuchel's England set-up.\n\nVilla's eight-match winning run in all competitions appeared under serious threat at the midway point of Sunday's game at third-bottom West Ham, who led 2-1 at the break against a side who appeared jaded and short of inspiration after Thursday's Europa League victory at Basel.\n\nIn the second half, however, Rogers decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\nThe 23-year-old scored his first of the afternoon five minutes into the second half, making it 2-2 from close range after West Ham had failed to clear Youri Tielemans' low cross into the box.\n\nThen, with the final 10 minutes approaching, Rogers collected a loose ball 30 yards from goal and was given time and space to slam a powerful, swerving strike into the top right corner of Alphonse Areola's goal and clinch a ninth straight victory for Unai Emery's third-placed team.\n\nThat magnificent effort capped a fine all-round performance from Rogers and reaffirmed his status as England's first-choice number 10 at next summer's World Cup - despite world-class competition from Foden, Palmer and Real Madrid's Jude Bellingham.\n\n\"He scored two fantastic goals and, for me, he is not just going to be in the squad next summer,\" said former England forward and Match of the Day pundit Theo Walcott. \"He is a dead cert to be a starter for England at the World Cup - 100%.\n\n\"He does everything, he's not just a goal threat. I like all [the contenders for the number 10 position], but one of them is going to have to miss out on the squad itself - and Rogers, for me, has to start.\"",

We should have more points, especially this season. So, I take that naturally.\n\n\"Sometimes they don't have all the information and see Manchester United with the standards they lived here, always winning. It's hard for them to see their club in this situation.\"\n\nAmorim rejects the theory the attacks make his job more difficult. His assessment is more simplistic.\n\n\"No,\" he added. \"Not winning is the issue.\n\n\"The problem is that me as a manager, I'm not doing good enough. That is a fact also and I can accept that. The only problem for them is that Manchester United is not winning and is not in the position that it's supposed to be.\n\n\"If you are winning, there is no issue.\"",
