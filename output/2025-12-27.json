    "title": "Letters to Sports: Playing the blame game in USC-Notre Dame debacle",
    "description": "Readers of the Los Angeles Times Sports section share their thoughts on the USC-Notre Dame rivalry, the Rams, UCLA, Angels and college football.",
    "fullText": "Bill Plaschke writes, “If the Trojans truly want to return to greatness, being selected for the CFP is the goal. Not beating Notre Dame. Not even beating UCLA.” That's 100% wrong.\n\nAs a USC alum (1965) and longtime fan, those are the only things that do matter. I have often said that if USC beats UCLA or Notre Dame, the coach deserves another season. To give up this grand tradition in pursuit of the arguably artificial and profit-driven CFP would be an unforgivable sin.\n\nA USC national football championship without playing Notre Dame rings hollow — an asterisked title, a meal that never satisfies, a taste you can’t quite wash away. It may shine in the record books, but it will always feel unfinished to those who know what real college football tradition demands. Earth to Lincoln Riley: an undefeated season is still a loss without playing the Fighting Irish. What’s next? If UCLA becomes competitive, then there will be no crosstown game?\n\nSo the Fighting Irish own a series edge of 53-37, have won 3 in a row, 7 of the last 8, and 11 of the last 15 games. Yet Bill Plaschke now claims that Notre Dame is running away from the series and is afraid of \"Ole SC.\" To paraphrase the late, great Jim Healy, Plaschke is on the Leonard Tose highway!\n\nNotre Dame is the Burger King of college football — always having it their way. From backdoor deals with the corrupt [CFP] guaranteeing a playoff spot if they finish ranked in the top 12 to refusing to join a conference so that they can pocket all bowl game money, the Irish are treated like college football royalty. Glad USC told the Irish toddlers they can’t have ice cream for breakfast!\n\n“USC and Notre Dame recognize how special our rivalry is to our fans …\" A joint statement by the athletic directors of the two schools. Really? Fake news!\n\nNo USC-Notre Dame football game! Who’s next to be cut from the Notre Dame football schedule, Navy? Oh wait, the Irish can’t afford to drop Navy. That might hurt their chance$ at a playoff berth.\n\nI don't think firing the Rams' special teams coach is the answer. How about running some tackling drills with the defensive backs during the week. I know there's \"no crying in baseball,\" but is it now \"there's no tackling in football?\" Throw in some deep coverage drills too!\n\nSo it looks like athletic director Martin Jarmond has forced UCLA followers to accept his decisions made outside of public scrutiny once again with a contract extension for Mick Cronin. If you haven’t noticed, UCLA basketball has been sliding into mediocrity. Seats at home games are increasingly vacant. USC is outrecruiting UCLA. Prices for seats would make you think you are going to see a top-tier team. UCLA has been sitting on distant memories. How long will it take to fully trash those memories? Jarmond’s easy-way-out decision is dooming the basketball program.\n\nHaving been a Kings fan since Luc Robitaille's rookie year, I have seen some very good Kings teams and some very bad ones. But never have I seen a team with so much potential and skill be so absolutely lethargic and unwatchable this season. This team currently ranks 31st out of 32 teams in overall scoring and power-play percentage. How bad is it? As of Christmas Eve, in the last 5 games the team has a total of 8 goals and 8 assists, or 16 points, the sum total of all 18 skaters on the ice over 5 games. Connor McDavid, the leading NHL scorer, has racked up 15 points in his last 5 games … just one skater. The saying goes that the fish rots from the head. Time to show coach Jim Hiller and his entire staff the door. A fresh start, a new motivator. Is Darryl Sutter available again?\n\nRonald J Peters\nColorado Springs, Colo.\n\nIn his Dec. 22 analysis, Bill Shaikin implies that payroll is the difference between winning and losing baseball teams. For the Angels, the on-field problems are rooted in off-the-field issues that have gone largely unchecked for at least a decade. As Angel fans, we can only hope that the settling of the Tyler Skaggs lawsuit, a low 2026 payroll, and one-year contracts to the GM and manager indicate that Arte Moreno is readying the Angels for sale. New ownership and upper management are what’s needed, not a higher payroll.\n\nIt was fitting that rapper 50 Cent performed live during Oklahoma’s first-round College Football Playoff loss, since the Sooners basically showed up for only two quarters.\n\nThe Los Angeles Times welcomes expressions of all views.

    "description": "With Baltimore pounding the rock with Derrick Henry and getting solid play from Tyler Huntley under center, they should cover this spread in a desperation spot.",
    "fullText": "The Green Bay Packers host the Baltimore Ravens in the penultimate week of the NFL regular season tonight.\n\nBaltimore will likely be missing superstar quarterback Lamar Jackson, but I expect the road team to play hard as they fight for their playoff lives.\n\nHere are my best free Ravens vs. Packers predictions and NFL picks for Week 17.\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens moved from +2.5 to +4.5 after Lamar Jackson was designated as doubtful. That’s puzzling, since it already seemed highly unlikely he would play, and the Green Bay Packers now have less motivation after clinching a playoff spot when the Lions lost on Christmas.\n\nKeep in mind that Jackson has been less than full strength due to multiple injuries, and backup quarterback Tyler Huntley is experienced. In Huntley’s lone start this year, he led Baltimore to a win against Chicago by completing 17 of 22 passes for 186 yards, adding another 53 yards on the ground.\n\nHuntley had seven completions to Zay Flowers in that game, and he also connected with Flowers three times in the fourth quarter after replacing Cooper Rush in Week 6. Flowers is easily Baltimore’s best receiver and should see plenty of targets this week.\n\nThe Ravens will take pressure off Huntley by relying on running back Derrick Henry. The Pro Bowler has rushed for more than 90 yards in three straight games, and the Packers were gashed for 150 rushing yards on 26 carries last week.\n\nOdds are correct at the time of publishing and are subject to change.\nNot intended for use in MA.\nAffiliate Disclosure: Our team of experts has thoroughly researched and handpicked each product that appears on our website.

    "description": "Max Verstappen says the sound of Formula 1's 2026 engines is \"crisp\"",
    "fullText": "Max Verstappen has shared his verdict on the audio recordings of the 2026 Formula 1 engines, claiming they sound \"crisp\".\n\n2026 will bring in a new wave of regulations to the championship, which will see power units with a 50/50 split between internal combustion engine and electric power.\n\nSome teams, including Aston Martin with the upcoming Honda engine and Mercedes, have shared the sounds of the new power units on social media. While we are yet to hear Red Bull's new engine, which will mark the start of Red Bull Powertrains in collaboration with Ford, Verstappen shared his thoughts on the Talking Bull podcast.\n\n\"Yeah. I mean, it sounded good. Of course, you hear it on a dyno, but it sounded crisp. I'm not sure they actually developed on the noise, but it made a good noise.\"\n\nThe four-time champion previously shared some of his hesitations about the new regulations, revealing that he would be open to leaving the series if he didn't find them \"fun\".\n\n“My contract runs until 2028, but it will depend on the new rules in 2026, and if they are nice and fun,\" he told PA about his F1 future. \"If they are not fun, then I don’t really see myself hanging around.\n\n“Winning seven titles is not on my mind. I know that there are three more years after this one, so it could be possible, but it is not something I need to do before I leave the sport. I can leave the sport easily tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Red Bull driver added: \"I have a lot of other passions; other racing categories, I want to spend more time with the family, and live off my own schedule. And in my mind, I know if I close the chapter, it is closed. I don’t see myself stopping and coming back. Once I stop, I really stop.\"\n\nMercedes releases 2026 F1 engine sound teaser ahead of regulation change\n\nHonda finally teased its 2026 F1 engine sound, and fans are obsessed\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "Manchester City arrive at the City Ground with momentum, confidence and one significant late decision to make. Whether Rodri is deemed fit enough to return against Nottingham Forest could shape both the rhythm of the contest and the wider Premier League picture.\n\nThe Spain midfielder has not featured since early November after suffering a hamstring injury, yet optimism has grown inside City’s camp. Pep Guardiola offered a guarded but positive update as preparations concluded.\n\n“Rodri is much, much better,” said Guardiola on Friday.\n\n“Available or not, we’ll decide today.”\n\nManchester City are chasing a result that would lift them above Arsenal, who face Brighton later on Saturday, and Guardiola is acutely aware of the need to preserve form while navigating a demanding festive schedule. Seven straight wins across all competitions have reinforced belief, and continuity has been key.\n\nGuardiola made no changes to his starting line-up for consecutive Premier League victories over West Ham and Crystal Palace, wins that delivered a combined score of 6-0. That settled selection speaks of a manager comfortable with his current formula, even as the calendar tightens with back-to-back away trips to Nottingham Forest and Sunderland.\n\nManchester City remain without Jeremy Doku and John Stones, with Guardiola confirming, “Doku and John still aren’t there but soon they’ll be back.” Oscar Bobb and Mateo Kovacic also remain sidelined, while Rayan Ait-Nouri and Omar Marmoush are unavailable due to international duty at AFCON.\n\nDefensive rotation options are limited. Abdukodir Khusanov is a possibility, but Guardiola is expected to trust the experience of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol against a direct Nottingham Forest side that thrives on physicality and tempo.\n\nAt the sharp end, City look well equipped. Erling Haaland has six goals in his last five matches and continues to lead the line with authority. Behind him, Rayan Cherki and Phil Foden have developed an increasingly influential partnership, blending invention with intensity.\n\nThat attacking trio is likely to be unleashed once more, placing immediate pressure on Nottingham Forest as City seek to control territory and dictate the pace from the outset.\n\nPredicted Man City XI (4-3-2-1): Donnarumma, Nunes, Dias, Gvardiol, O’Reilly, Silva, Gonzalez, Reijnders, Cherki, Foden, Haaland\n\nInjured: Kovacic, Doku, Stones, Bobb\n\nUnavailable: Ait-Nouri, Marmoush\n\nKick-off: 12.30pm GMT, Saturday December 27, 2025",

    "fullText": "Feelings around the New Orleans Saints’ season have gone in an entirely different direction in recent weeks, and with that, their draft pick continues to fall.\n\nLos Angeles Rams (previously owned by Atlanta Falcons)\n\nNew York Jets (previously owned by the Indianapolis Colts)\n\nDallas Cowboys (previously owned by the Green Bay Packers)\n\nCleveland Browns (previously owned by the Jacksonville Jaguars)\n\nLike the past few weeks, the Saints dropping in the draft order is not the end of the world. There are still several great players available, and S Caleb Downs could be one of the top options. Safety is not a position of need for New Orleans, but this is all about the best player available and talent. Downs is one of the best players in the draft.\n\nIf positional value were removed, Downs would be in the race for #1 overall. He can play throughout the defense, is a great tackler, and plays like a cornerback in coverage. Instead of safety, where his central college position is, Downs could play slot corner for the Saints. This would both fill a need and add top-end talent to the roster. This would become an even better pick if Alontae Taylor, who is out of contract after this season, leaves in free agency.",

    "description": "Here’s everything you need to know about Dakar 2026, including the full route and schedule for the two-week rally-raid",
    "fullText": "The 47th edition of the Dakar Rally will begin on 3 January and mark the start of the 2026 motorsport season.\n\nAs has been the case every year since 2020, the event will run entirely in Saudi Arabia, having moved from its former base in South America. This means the Gulf nation will be the sole host of the world’s most prestigious cross-country rally for the seventh consecutive year\n\nBut while the location remains the same, organiser ASO has significantly reworked the route for 2026, offering competitors a fresh challenge across Saudi Arabia’s vast deserts.\n\nThe 2026 Dakar Rally will feature 13 full stages, plus the traditional Prologue that will help determine the starting order for the first full day of action. The rally will be split by a rest day in the capital Riyadh, allowing crews some vital recovery time before the decisive second week.\n\nCompetitors in the cars category will cover 7,994 kilometres over two weeks, including 4,880km in the form of competitive special stages, with the remainder made up of transport sections.\n\nWith nearly 5,000km of timed running, the 2026 edition will be one of the longest Dakars in terms of competitive distance, making it potentially one of the toughest events in the rally’s recent history.\n\nOne of the biggest changes for 2026 is the removal of the 48-hour chrono stage, which was introduced in 2024 and revised for last year’s event.\n\nThe decision was made in the wake of a crash-heavy 2025 event in which several leading contenders were knocked out in the opening week, including on the brutal 48-hour stage early in the rally.\n\n\"That's not the case because last year we had a small problem, especially with the cars, but also with the motorcycles,\" Dakar director David Castera explained.\n\n\"It was mainly about strategy, starting order, and so on. A 48-hour stage doesn't really help in that regard, so I scrapped it. We'll see if we can find another solution later.\n\n“But last year we already saw that many competitors deliberately stopped at the end of the stages so they could start later the next day. So they deliberately lost time.\"\n\nIn place of the 48-hour stage, the old two-day marathon format returns in 2026 and will appear twice on the route. As per marathon rules, competitors will not be allowed any external assistance from their support crews at the overnight bivouac.\n\nThe first marathon will take place stages on 4 and 5 through Al Ula and Hail, while the second one will comprise stages 9 and 10 when competitors traverse through Wadi Ad Dawasir and Bisha.\n\nFurther, Dakar will not venture into the unforgiving Empty Quarters desert in Saudi Arabia as part of the new route. However, there will be no shortage of sand dunes this year, particularly in the second week when drivers and riders tackle the barren regions around Wadi Ad Dawasir.\n\n\"The difficulty is different from last year or the year before, because now the number of kilometres is the most important factor,” said Castera.\n\n“We have almost 5,000 kilometres of timed stages, and that's a lot. It's been a long time since we've had that many kilometres. I think this is one of the longest Dakars ever.”\n\n*denotes marathon stages Read Also:\n\nRed Bull co-owner Mark Mateschitz to enter Dakar Rally under an alias\n\nSebastien Loeb admits you “need some luck to win” Dakar ahead of 10th start\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "Bryce Harper is not letting bygones be bygones, if the shirt the Phillies slugger wore in the batting cage is any indication.",
    "fullText": "Phillies’ Bryce Harper sends subtle shade to Dave Dombrowski with ‘Not Elite’ shirt appeared first on ClutchPoints. \n\nBryce Harper does not forget. Nor does he even want to. On Friday, the Philadelphia Phillies slugger made waves when he wore a shirt that appears to be a clapback towards an earlier comment made about him by Phillies president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski.\n\nDombrowski, when asked about Harper and his contributions for the Phillies this past 2025, remarked that the 33-year-old slugger “didn’t have an elite season like he’s had in the past”. Making matters worse, Dombrowski then questioned if Harper could return to that elite level or if he “continues to be [just] good” moving forward.\n\nThe Phillies slugger seems to have taken that comment to heart, and the shirt he wore during practice in a batting cage has a print that says “NOT ELITE”, referencing that comment from Dombrowski.\n\nBryce Harper posted a video on TikTok hitting in a shirt that says “NOT ELITE” https://t.co/ShlwxDFoK8 pic.twitter.com/yKxYRrsCKt\n\n— Talkin' Baseball (@TalkinBaseball_) December 27, 2025\n\nHarper has already said in the past that these comments hurt him and being in trade rumors after the Phillies’ NLDS exit made him feel very uncomfortable. Perhaps he responds well to negativity and returns to elite form in 2026 just to stick it to management. And maybe this is why Dombrowski said what he said in the first place.\n\nHarper did have a bit of a down season for the Phillies in 2025, especially when compared to 2024 when he put up 5.1 fWAR thanks to an OPS of .898. But he did miss 30 games in 2025, and his peripheral stats did stay mostly the same — with a decline in batted-ball luck contributing to an overall decline in level of production (a 13-point drop in wRC+ and a .054 decline in OPS).\n\nMake no mistake about it, Harper remains a very good player. And at 33 years of age, he has plenty of gas left in the tank. The Phillies have to concentrate on keeping him healthy, and a healthy level of production should follow.",

    "fullText": "After a much-needed holiday break, Barcelona will return to training soon as they gear up for the all-important Catalan derby to start the new year.\n\nHowever, as Barcelona look to return to training, there is uncertainty surrounding the return of two of their stars.\n\nThe players in question are Dani Olmo and Ronald Araujo, who have been out of action for Barcelona in recent matches on account of very different reasons.\n\nAccording to SPORT, Araujo’s return to training seems uncertain right now as the club do not want to rush him back to the pitch.\n\nThe Uruguayan international had been struggling with his mental health following the backlash received after a costly error against Chelsea.\n\nHe was tipped to return to training on December 29 to prepare for the game against Espanyol. But it appears the club have left it up to the player to decide when he wants to return to training.\n\nRonald Araujo’s immediate return still remains uncertain. (Photo by Angel Martinez/Getty Images)\n\nAs for Olmo, he was expected to be only for a month. But it appears his injury is extremely sensitive, and given his past record, Barcelona are taking extreme caution.\n\nThe club, after all, cannot afford Olmo to aggravate his injury, especially before going into an important phase of the campaign. He was initially expected to play a few minutes vs Espanyol, but that appears to be a doubt at the moment.\n\nOlmo was looking like one of the most in-form players at Barcelona before picking up an injury. The club, therefore, will want him fully fit during the second half of the campaign.\n\nAs for Araujo, his return will also be imperative given that Barcelona have also lost Andreas Christensen due to injury.\n\nAlthough the Catalans are actively looking for a potential replacement from the market, nothing can be guaranteed given the club’s economic situation. Therefore, Barcelona want Araujo mentally and physically fit when he returns to the fold.",

    "description": "Everyone's favorite non-CFP bowl is back, and this time, it will feature a grand total of six edible Pop-Tarts mascots.",
    "fullText": "It's time for everyone's favorite non-CFP bowl game.\n\nWhile the Pop-Tarts Bowl game itself has been in existence since 1990, it only adopted the Pop-Tarts branding in 2023. Its viral marketing strategy has quickly made it one of the most anticipated games on the entire bowl calendar, in large part thanks to its conclusion, in which the edible mascot is lowered into a giant toaster and consumed by the winning team.\n\nGeorgia Tech and BYU are squaring off in the 2025 Pop-Tarts Bowl in Orlando on Saturday, with both teams wearing Pop-Tarts-inspired helmets. They will also be joined on the field by not one but an entire platoon of edible Pop-Tarts mascots.\n\nThe mascots are divided into two teams — \"Team Sprinkles\" and \"Team Swirls.\" The two Pop-Tarts teams will battle it out during the game for the right to be consumed by the winning football team.\n\nWith the Pop-Tarts rosters featuring a mix of recurring characters and newcomers, here are our official (and entirely objective) power rankings of all six mascots.\n\nIt's nothing personal against Frosted Cherry, which is a very solid Pop-Tart. However, it's simply outmatched by some of the remaining contenders on this list.\n\nLike Frosted Cherry, Frosted Wild Berry just struggles to contend with some of the more iconic competitors on this list. However, it does bring some interesting aesthetics to the table with its purple frosting, and its status as a Pop-Tarts Bowl veteran gives it the edge over a rookie like Wild Cherry.\n\nBoth an iconic Pop-Tarts flavor and a returning mascot for the Pop-Tarts Bowl, this ranking feels a bit low for Frosted Hot Fudge Sundae. It's a great flavor and brings a ton of nostalgia with it. Plus, it's been there before. Still, all of that was not quite enough to crack the top three.\n\nNow, we're getting into the real heavy-hitters. It's here where I must admit that this list isn't entirely objective. I'm a biased author who loves my Frosted Cookies & Crème Pop-Tarts. If I were basing this list entirely off of my preferences, it would be No. 1 on this list. But I must set that aside, because the two team captains are absolute legends of the game.\n\nAfter making its return to the shelves following its discontinuation in 2022, Frosted Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough is now making its Pop-Tarts Bowl debut in a major leadership role as it will serve as the captain of \"Team Swirls.\" This iconic flavor is available once again thanks to popular demand, and its glorious return is enough to earn the No. 2 spot in these rankings.\n\nWho else could have been No. 1? While it's simple, the Strawberry Pop-Tart is the most iconic member of the lineup, and its extra protein variety will serve as the captain for \"Team Sprinkle.\" The chiseled veteran is back and hoping to be consumed once again.\n\nOh, and did I mention it's absolutely yolked?\n\nProtein Slammin Strawberry has entered the chat…and the weight room.\n\nCatch them pumping everyone up at the Pop-Tarts Bowl on Dec. 27! pic.twitter.com/XWpee5wg5O\n\n— Pop-Tarts Bowl (@PopTartsBowl) December 10, 2025\n\nDid you need a png of Protein Strawberry? https://t.co/NzXfU7FnQ3 pic.twitter.com/wEiwIFJuub\n\n— Sickos Committee (@SickosCommittee) December 10, 2025\n\nThis was an absolute no-brainer.\n\nThis article originally appeared on For The Win: 2025 Pop-Tarts Bowl: Power ranking every edible mascot",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have accumulated the fewest disciplinary points in the league, with 22 points made up entirely of yellow cards, placing them ahead of Manchester City and Leeds United, who both sit on 27 points.\n\nThe figures mark a clear shift from last season, when Arsenal were shown three red cards in their opening eight league matches.\n\nThose dismissals involved Declan Rice, Leandro Trossard and William Saliba, with Rice and Trossard sent off for kicking the ball away and delaying the restart against Brighton & Hove Albion and Manchester City.\n\nThey have not received any red cards so far this season.\n\nSpeaking ahead of Saturday’s home match against Brighton, Arteta said he believes a change in how the laws are being applied has played a role in Arsenal’s improved red card record.\n\n“I think the rules are different now,” he said.\n\n“So, we paid a big price with that (delaying the restart) rule, and hopefully that stays away and we continue to play with 11 players.”\n\nArteta also reflected on Rice’s dismissal at the Emirates Stadium in August last year, admitting the manner of that performance left a lasting impression.\n\n“I remember it very well,” he said. “I was very hacked off in the manner that we played with 10 men. So hopefully it is going to be very different this time.”\n\nAsked about Arsenal’s position at the top of the fair play standings, Arteta said he was unaware of the statistic but welcomed it.\n\n“I didn’t know. That is good, very good.”\n\nArsenal’s record leaves them ahead of several direct rivals, including Manchester United, Aston Villa and Liverpool, while Tottenham Hotspur and Chelsea sit at the bottom of the table.",

    "fullText": "If appeal fails, every person in UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to compensation\n\nApple is seeking to overturn a landmark £1.5bn court ruling on behalf of millions of UK customers, which found the company overcharged them for years in its App Store.\n\nThe iPhone maker has applied to the court of appeal to challenge a verdict that campaigners heralded as the start of a “tidal shift against big tech”.\n\nIt is one of a cluster of cases heading towards trial in 2026 as consumers realise the mounting cost of paying up to 30% commission – what campaigners call the “Apple tax” – on apps and in-app purchases, which more people rely on for activities from fitness to dating.\n\nThe appeal, if allowed, involves one of several class action suits against Apple and Google in which consumers, small businesses and entrepreneurs are demanding over £6bn in combined compensation. The class action cases use an opt-out system that means millions of people can be represented at once in claims of breaches of competition law.\n\n“It’s definitely a tipping point,” said Dr Rachael Kent, an academic at King’s College London who won the £1.5bn case against Apple on behalf of 36 million UK consumers. “People are pushing back against the harms from digital worlds, which they have to be living in and through every day and the financial implications of that,” she said.\n\nKent added that the win in October still felt “a bit pinch me”. If Apple’s appeal fails, every person in the UK who made App Store purchases between 2015 and 2024 could be entitled to a payout.\n\nIn the suite of class action cases, Apple and Google are accused of overcharging British consumers and developers in their app stores and, in the case of Apple, of “trapping” and overcharging customers with its iCloud data storage service.\n\nInstead of up to 30%, Apple should be charging commission of 17.5% when selling apps and 10% on in-app purchases, while app developers should pay 10%, the competition appeal tribunal found in Kent’s case.\n\nAnother of the cases is being brought by Barry Rodger, a law professor at the University of Strathclyde, on behalf of more than 2,000 app developers who he argues are collectively entitled to up to £1bn in compensation.\n\n“Small and medium-sized app developer businesses have suffered as the result of excessive profiteering by the App Store and Google Play,” he said. His case alleges Google Play has charged “excessive, arbitrary and discriminatory commissions” against developers, with the makers of dating and games apps particularly affected.\n\nHis suit is expected to reach trial at the competitions appeal tribunal in October 2026, and will be jointly managed with a claim for about £1bn on behalf of 19 million Google Play customers, who are alleged to have been overcharged. That case is being brought by the consumer activist Liz Coll and accuses Google of “excluding competition and/or charging an unlawfully high level of commission on digital purchases”, breaching competition law.\n\nColl said: “These types of large collective proceedings are new in the UK, but I’m really excited about the potential of the Kent decision to not only make people aware they were paying too much for apps through opaque commission but also that there is now a clear route to getting that put right. Where we need consumers to get really active now is in claiming back the money they’re owed.”\n\nA Google spokesperson said: “Android provides more choice than any other platform and our fees are the lowest of any major app platform. We’ll defend these cases vigorously.”\n\nGoogle argues that the class action cases seek to upend a system that has lowered prices and increased choice and that, if successful, would make downloading and using apps on Android phones more complicated and less safe.\n\nAnd in the largest of all the claims, November saw the consumer campaign group Which? announce a £3bn claim against Apple over its iCloud services, claiming it is “trapping” customers with Apple devices into using it.\n\nApple called the Which? claims unfounded and said no customers are required to use iCloud. The company said it strongly disagrees with the ruling in Kent’s case over the App Store, and the tribunal took a flawed view of the “thriving and competitive app economy”, with other platforms providing “vigorous competition”. It said most apps are subject to a 15% commission, and the App Store helps drive the UK’s digital economy, facilitating billings and sales of over $55bn (£41bn) in the UK in 2024.\n\nKent said that people are “waking up to the harms of digital life and how it can be detrimental mentally, physically and financially”.\n\n“There is a tidal shift that is happening against big tech,” she said. “Consumers are looking at all of the tools that they have to use every day. Covid really accelerated our reliance on technology and many of us went from using five apps in a week to perhaps 10 apps in a day to manage food shopping, food delivery, retail, fitness and diet tracking, keeping in close communication with friends and family, much more social media, increased screen time.\n\n“A big part of the last six years working the case has been about educating people that this is actually happening. That’s what tech giants and marketeers like Apple are so brilliant at. It’s creating an ecosystem where we are foreclosed into decision making and we don’t even realise that this is actually how it’s happening.”",

    "fullText": "Merlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 bird species around the world\n\nWhen Natasha Walter first became curious about the birds around her, she recorded their songs on her phone and arduously tried to match each song with online recordings. After a friend recommended Merlin Bird ID, a free app, she tried it in her London garden and was delighted to discover the birds she assumed were female blackbirds – “this is how bad a birder I was” – were actually song thrushes and mistle thrushes.\n\n“I’m obsessed with Merlin – it’s wonderful and it’s been a joy to me,” says Walter, a writer and human rights activist. “This is what AI and machine-learning have been invented for. It’s the one good thing!”\n\nMerlin is having a moment. The app, developed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology in New York, which listens for birdsong and identifies the species singing, has been downloaded 33m times, in 240 countries and territories around the world. Britain has the second highest total number of users – more than 1.5 million in 2024, an 88% increase from 2023. Every month, there has been a 30% increase in new users of the app, whose sound identification function was launched in 2021.\n\nMerlin has been trained to identify the songs of more than 1,300 species around the world, with more birds added twice a year. Different songs make distinct patterns on spectrograms and Merlin is trained to recognise these different shapes and attribute them to a species.\n\nFor latecomers to birding, or those lacking a knowledgeable friend, the app has become their teacher. “My fear at first was I wouldn’t actually learn because I’m outsourcing my understanding of birds to this app,” says Walter. “But that hasn’t come to pass. It’s helped me continue my journey of learning.” Nowadays, she guesses, and uses Merlin to confirm her hunches. “It’s wonderful if you’re coming to bird-watching late and don’t really have a mentor,” she says.\n\nAngela Townsend from Bedfordshire began using Merlin after going on a nightingale walk one spring and being overwhelmed by the range of bird-voices in the evening chorus. She has found it has steadily built up her bird knowledge. “Warblers were just little brown jobbies but I can now recognise Cetti’s warblers and willow warblers when I’m out without having to put the app on,” she says.\n\nMary Novakovich, author of My Family and Other Enemies, is another recent adopter. She has found it particularly useful when travelling across Croatia, where her parents are from. “I love putting a name to a face and a name to the sound,” she says. “It really brings you closer to the natural world, rather than it being disconnected from your life. It’s part of what makes life a joy.”\n\nMerlin is not flawless, however. The first time Kasper Wall, 12, tried it in his Norfolk garden, it detected a northern cardinal and a brown-headed cowbird – North American species not found in Britain.\n\n“I think it was figuring out where we live,” says Wall, who enjoys using it even though he is now an extremely knowledgeable birder. “A couple of weeks ago we were looking at a large group of goldcrest and it came up with a firecrest. I thought, ‘Oh, there must be a firecrest in here too’ and 30 seconds later we saw one, which was the first I’d ever seen. I like it and it’s very good but I wouldn’t say that it’s better than the best people at identifying bird-calls like [the naturalist] Nick Acheson. It can definitely be fooled.”\n\nWall enjoys fooling Merlin with his uncanny impressions of a curlew, barn owl and greenshank.\n\nAcheson doesn’t use Merlin. He welcomes it, but points out it can replace learning. “Anything that gets people out, thinking about and reacting to nature is a great thing,” he says. “But there’s certainly a risk that people don’t learn and just abdicate responsibility for learning to Merlin.”\n\nHe has noticed a glitch where Merlin interprets a certain type of chaffinch call as a redstart, leading to people being absolutely adamant that there is a rare bird in their garden. “There’s no substitute for a real person explaining to you how a birdsong feels and encouraging someone to engage with it emotionally,” he says.\n\nJohn Williamson, who works as a guide for Norfolk Wildlife Trust, has found Merlin repeatedly identifying high-pitched calls as a spotted flycatcher, a bird that is very unlikely to be found in the middle of Hickling Broad nature reserve’s large reedbeds. “Merlin can’t do habitat,” he says.\n\nMerlin has also excited visitors by identifying a golden oriole, a very occasional rare migrant, in Hickling woods, but no one has actually seen the species. Williamson is convinced it is misinterpreting a fairly unusual “catcall” of a female jay, a common woodland bird.\n\nThat said, Williamson finds it a “good tool” and welcomes how it is encouraging new people to enjoy birdsong, and particularly its mental health benefits. He knows one person who suffers from acute anxiety but Merlin has got him out into the world again and into nature, providing a focus for calming trips outdoors. “I find it impressive that an app can empower people to go out into nature,” he says.\n\nResearch has found that birdsong is particularly beneficial to mental health, and has a lasting positive impact on wellbeing. For millions around the globe, that’s exactly what Merlin is doing.\n\n“It reminds you that there are birds knitted into your daily life,” says Walter. “It’s not about, ‘now I’m going to do a bit of birdwatching’, you may simply be walking through the park and you hear something and it gives you a sense that these birds are singing away all the time, even in London.”",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Davon Moseley, the content creator and food influencer behind Royale Eats. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhile I was in graduate school pursuing my master's degree, I began posting photos and videos of the meals I was cooking. I didn't think much of it at first — I certainly didn't have a road map or business plan — but people started responding in a way I didn't expect.\n\nAs more people followed my page, I decided to release my first real product: an eBook. I had no idea how it would perform, but it turned out to be a huge success. That was when I realized this could be more than just a hobby. It could be a real business.\n\nToday, with millions of followers across platforms, Royale Eats is my full-time job. What started as a creative outlet has become a sustainable business that supports not only me but also the small team I've built.\n\nI work with a management team and a few contractors — videographers, photographers, and graphic designers. Right now, everyone is contract-based, but I'm working to bring everything in-house and build a full-time team on payroll. Collaboration is important to me; everyone brings something unique to the table, and that helps elevate the brand as a whole.\n\nLike most content creators, my income comes from multiple streams. Here's how it breaks down:\n\nBrand collaborations — about 30%\n\nI partner with different brands to create sponsored content or consult on food-related campaigns.\n\nThis includes eBook sales, other digital products, and my first cookbook.\n\nI earn money through ads on my website and blog.\n\nI invest in brands that align with my values and interests.\n\nSocial media platform revenue — about 20%\n\nThis comes from monetized content on platforms like Instagram and YouTube.\n\nI'm proud that the business generates enough income for me to live comfortably, especially compared to what I'd earn in a traditional corporate role. But more than that, I get to do something I genuinely love every day.\n\nThis year, I launched First Bite Studios, my own production company. We already released our first show, \"Borders,\" which just wrapped its first season on YouTube. My goal is to eventually bring it to television — but for now, I'm focused on growing the audience and building quality content.\n\nMany of my followers are novice cooks: individuals who are just beginning to learn their way around the kitchen. I found that they connected most with my slower-paced, instructional style. I tried making fast-paced, entertainment-style videos for a while, but my audience didn't respond to them the same way. They wanted to learn — not just watch. And that's where I've found my niche.\n\nI always tell people: stay curious and be a student. You can't afford to have an ego in this business. The moment you think you know everything is the moment you stop growing.\n\nMy debut cookbook came out on November 4, and it was a major learning project to bring it to life. Now, I'm focused on expanding my production company and continuing to create new shows and collaborations. I want Royale Eats to be a brand that not only teaches people to cook but also inspires them to connect with food, family, and creativity.\n\nI've learned that growth occurs when you stay true to your vision, remain humble, and continue learning. That mindset has taken me from a simple side hustle to a full-time business in less than three years — and I'm just getting started.",

    "title": "There's no silver bullet to the US Navy's shipbuilding woes: report",
    "description": "The US Navy is struggling to compete with China due to a spate of failed ship classes. A new report warns there's no easy fix.",
    "fullText": "The US Navy faces a number of challenges in its goal of growing the fleet. None are easily or quickly solvable.\n\nA new report from naval and defense policy experts assesses that a number of actions are urgently needed across shipbuilders and the government to fix the Navy's delays and cost overruns, especially as China's fleet surpasses the US' in size and adopts new technologies to become a dominant naval power.\n\nMany of the Navy's problems, including retiring more ships than it is building, a slowed and expensive shipbuilding process with only a handful of commercial shipyards, and program mismanagement, trace back to the end of the Cold War. They've gotten worse in the decades since and are reaching a boiling point as the US military attempts to focus on countering China's military rise.\n\n\"Despite the Navy's plans for growing the fleet and bipartisan efforts and funding from Congress, the US shipbuilding enterprise — including the Navy, Department of Defense, Congress, and industry — has failed to consistently produce ships at the scale, speed, and cost demanded,\" authors of the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, or CSIS, report wrote.\n\nAmong the failed projects: Two types of littoral combat ships, an advanced stealth destroyer the service will only have three of, and the newly canceled Constellation-class frigate.\n\nNo one entity, incident, or program is solely to blame. Washington's demand signal for building new vessels has been inconsistent, leaving shipbuilders unable to plan long-term projects. And the Navy's requirement process and ship designs have sometimes resulted in vessels not meeting expectations, being delayed by years, and coming in far over budget.\n\nRight now, Navy Secretary John Phelan, officials in DoD, and shipyards are focused on fixing these problems and avoiding the same mistakes in the future. Shipbuilding is a top priority, and it's gotten a lot of attention throughout the first year of the second Trump administration.\n\nBut, per the report, there is no single solution to arrest the decline in American shipbuilding, \"and resolving any one of the underlying issues does not guarantee a drastic improvement of the situation.\" Instead, the Navy, Congress, and shipyards will have to find the right way forward through years of work.\n\nThe Navy's battle force, including surface ships, submarines, and aircraft carriers, peaked during the build-up in the second Reagan administration at 568. After the Cold War, the number dwindled, as the US focused on land wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; the fleet hit its low point of 271 in 2015. A year later, the Navy released plans of a 355-ship goal, which increased in 2023 under the Biden administration to 381 and 134 large uncrewed surface and underwater vehicles.\n\nThese goals have proven unreachable without an effective small warship whose price tag is well below $13 billion Ford-class aircraft carriers and $2 billion guided-missile destroyers.\n\nCompared to the US, China has amassed a huge fleet over the last 25 years. Thanks to its state-owned shipbuilders and dual-use commercial and military shipyards, equipment, and workforce, China's fleet reached a height of an estimated 370 battle force ships last year. China's naval growth has alarmed officials even if they are not all a match for the US' highly advanced, well-built vessels and weapons.\n\nNavy officials have increasingly looked at uncrewed vessels to rapidly add new capabilities to the fleet. A mix of large, medium, and small drone boats would be useful for a number of intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance missions, and could expand the Navy's reach in regions like the Indo-Pacific while keeping sailors out of harm's way. Companies can build these autonomous vessels fast but questions remain on how effective drone ships are; the few operational drone boats today largely act as surveillance vessels. It's still a relatively new field, but it could present short-term answers to fleet problems by reducing the demand for crewed ships.\n\nThe Navy's current fleet has also seen a higher tempo of operations, putting \"greater stress on the fleet and its crews as a smaller number of ships must deploy more regularly to mission demands, thereby increasing the need for greater maintenance and sustainment,\" the CSIS report noted.\n\nEarlier this year, then-acting Chief of Naval Operations Adm. James Kilby said the Navy was clocking in at a 68% readiness rate for surface ships and 67% for submarines, while aviation stands at 70%. The service aims for 80% by 2027.\n\nPart of the disparity stems from ship maintenance delays. The US's current capacity to keep its fleet running has been strained across shipyards, resulting in repairs often taking 20% to 100% longer than estimated, according to a new Congressional Budget Office analysis. There are many causes for that: the average age of the Navy's ships is older than it used to be and require more work and the scope of maintenance is often larger than anticipated.\n\nKeeping older vessels ready is one challenge but the Navy's goals of building new ones has continued to face hurdles with increased construction times, holdups across major programs, and cost overruns. In a US Government Accountability Office report earlier this year, the government watchdog agency assessed that 37 of the 45 battle force ships under construction were delayed as of fall 2024.\n\nThat's been blamed on several things, including the Navy's focus on price in contracting rather than speed, rising prices for ships due to purchasing fewer hulls, and changes to ship designs and capabilities during construction. The recently cancelled Constellation-class frigate is a prime example of how design changes can doom a program by causing delays and soaring costs. The frigate was originally supposed to have 80% commonality with its Italian navy version but only ended up with 15%.\n\nOn the industry side, the shipbuilding sector has shrunk and largely serves to build ships for the Navy and Coast Guard and a few merchant ships; most commercial shipbuilding has shifted to countries like Japan, South Korea, and China, where they are cheaper to build.\n\nWashington, the Navy, and shipbuilders are pursuing several avenues to address these problems. Billions are being invested in the industrial base, with a major focus on submarines, and broader initiatives are focused on training the next generation of workers. Modernization efforts in shipyards, including automation, artificial intelligence, and robotics, are a priority as well to drive down costs.\n\nGiven the vast lead and advantages of competitors like South Korea and China, it's these could drive down ship production costs. But they are unlikely to revitalize a commercial ship industry that can be converted to war-time use, as occurred in World War II.\n\nBut the issues afflicting American shipbuilding are complex. \"There is no single policy solution to solve the overall problem,\" CSIS authors wrote, \"Moreover, resolving any of the underlying issues does not guarantee a drastic improvement of the situation.\"\n\nIn its conclusion, the report suggests that continuous production of Navy vessels based on multi-year contracting would stabilize projects, budgets, and the workforce.\n\nAnother solution could involve more cooperation with US partners and allies, something Washington is already pursuing. South Korean shipyards, some of the most advanced and busiest in the world, are conducting more maintenance on US Navy vessels and major partnerships between these yards and the US are aimed at modernizing American shipbuilding processes and workflows.",

    "title": "Immigration lawyers say the H-1B chaos is forcing tough business calls",
    "description": "H-1B visa policy shifts in 2025 cause firms to reconsider staffing, use alternative visas, and update HR travel guidance.",
    "fullText": "Since September, the H-1B visa program has been caught in a whirlwind of changes.\n\nAs a result, companies nationwide are scrambling to determine their next steps, rewriting travel guidance for foreign workers, and lining up backup staffing plans, including shifting some work overseas, according to five immigration attorneys who spoke with Business Insider.\n\n\"Unpredictability is one of the number one enemies for business,\" said Rohit Srinivasa, an immigration attorney based in Los Angeles who works with startups and medium-sized tech companies.\n\nFirst came a $100,000 fee on new applications in September. Then came social media vetting requirements that left visa holders stranded abroad during the holidays. Now, a wage-based lottery system will favor the highest-paid applicants by giving them more chances in the annual H-1B lottery.\n\nImmigration lawyers say the constant policy shifts have companies tightening sponsorship guidelines, re-budgeting for higher costs, and gaming out contingency plans for a program that keeps changing shape.\n\nCompanies are taking a more calculated approach to who they sponsor for work visas and how they do so, attorneys told Business Insider.\n\nDivij Kishore, an immigration attorney at New York-based Flagship Law, which represents clients across various sectors, including tech, healthcare, and energy, told Business Insider that he has seen a 40% to 50% drop in H-1B sponsorship inquiries compared to previous years.\n\nTypically, by this time of the year, clients reach out with lists of employees they'd like to sponsor for the spring lottery, Kishore said.\n\n\"This year, that's not been the case because employers are just not sure what the costs are,\" Kishore said.\n\nOn the other hand, K. Edward Raleigh, a partner at immigration firm Fragomen, which represents some of Silicon Valley's largest tech companies, including Apple and Nvidia, told Business Insider that he hasn't seen a material slowdown in H-1B filings overall, as most are renewals for existing workers.\n\nStill, companies are \"tightening up their sponsorship guidelines\" and \"proceeding with caution, understanding that various things could trigger the fee,\" he said.\n\nThis recalculation is occurring despite the $100,000 fee having a narrow scope. It applies to new visa petitions for workers living abroad and does not apply to the vast majority of cases, such as foreign students already in the US switching from an academic visa to a work visa or existing H-1B holders changing employers.\n\n\"One of the main attributes of this administration is that they keep people guessing,\" said Ted Chiappari, who leads the immigration practice at law firm Duane Morris. \"Just because things are one way on Monday doesn't mean they're going to be the same way on Tuesday, and they won't switch back to things on Wednesday.\"\n\nFewer H-1B visas have been issued to Indian IT consulting firms, according to data from the National Foundation for American Policy, an Arlington-based nonprofit research organization focused on immigration and international trade.\n\nInstead, for the first time in the program's history, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupied the top four spots for H-1B approvals in fiscal year 2025, a shift that began before the recent policy upheaval. The trend suggests companies were already reassessing tech hiring strategies before the recent policy changes.\n\nDespite the turmoil, Srinivasa believes the H-1B will endure, saying the program is \"so baked in\" to the US economy, he said, that it's undergoing overhaul rather than replacement.\n\nSome sectors saw more impact than others. Universities and nonprofit healthcare organizations that have historically recruited professors and medical workers from abroad have largely stopped filing petitions subject to the fee, Chiappari said. Unlike for-profit companies, these institutions can hire H-1B workers throughout the year without going through the annual lottery.\n\n\"That pipeline is now dried up,\" Chiappari said.\n\nRather than abandoning H-1B sponsorship, companies are exploring alternative pathways and backup strategies.\n\nSrinivasa said interest in O-1 visas for workers with \"extraordinary ability\" has surged, though not everyone qualifies. To qualify, applicants typically need to demonstrate a track record of impact and achievements in their field as evidenced by patents, awards, membership in select associations, and media coverage about them.\n\nSome founders from countries with US trade treaties are turning to E-2 investor visas, which also provide work authorization for spouses. Others are using the EB-1C path, where companies send managers abroad for a year before bringing them back to the US.\n\nCompanies are also increasingly establishing international offices and using L-1 visas to transfer employees to the US, or opting for services like Deel and Rippling that serve as the official employer, handling immigration paperwork on behalf of client companies.\n\nBig Tech, as well as Wall Street firms such as JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs, have been expanding their operations in Indian cities like Bengaluru and Hyderabad.\n\nKishore said some clients are preemptively reaching out to offshore providers to ramp up staffing capacity in case they are unable to bring workers to the US as planned.\n\n\"If they can't spend that same hundred dollars within the US next year, they will spend a hundred dollars outside the US,\" he added.\n\nStarting with the 2026 lottery, visa applications will be weighted based on salary level. Workers offered the highest wages will get four entries in the lottery, while those at the lowest tier get just one. The administration says this will ensure visas are awarded to the most skilled workers.\n\nRaleigh said companies are already thinking about how this will affect their recruitment strategy, \"without the exact terms of how those rules are going to work.\"\n\nThe change will likely benefit large tech companies that can afford to place workers in top salary bands, while creating challenges for smaller companies, nonprofits, and early-stage startups.\n\n\"Often the best startup founders forgo being paid a living wage because they're so dedicated to the mission,\" said Sophie Alcorn, a Bay Area immigration attorney who focuses on startups and entrepreneurs. \"Those same startups may be the ones that have the most difficulty in getting the right people through this future system.\"\n\nKishore said that a higher salary doesn't always mean more skill. A first-year associate at a major law firm might make $225,000, while an equally qualified associate at a smaller firm makes significantly less. Under the new system, the big-firm lawyer would have much better lottery chances, he said.\n\nSome attorneys are advising clients not to artificially inflate salaries to game the system. Chiappari said the spread between wage levels is typically $20,000 to $30,000 — far less than the $100,000 fee — and companies aren't rushing to increase compensation anyway.\n\nImmigration attorneys previously thought that the $100,000 fee might improve the chances for foreign students already studying in the US by increasing their chances if fewer companies enter candidates in the lottery. Now, the wage-based lottery means that it might not happen.\n\n\"That logic's been turned on its head,\" said Kishore, adding that students, who typically enter the workforce at lower salaries, will get fewer chances at the lottery.\n\nBeyond policy changes, companies are also recalibrating their compliance strategies to avoid triggering fees or violating new rules.\n\nRaleigh said that ensuring workers maintain valid immigration status has become even more critical, as any lapse could force someone to leave the country and return on a new H-1B visa, potentially triggering the $10,000 fee.\n\nCompanies are updating their HR policies, including guidance on social media presence for foreign hires, in response to new vetting requirements, Srinivasa said. Some are advising employees to avoid international travel altogether, even when technically permitted.\n\nChiappari said he still gets constant questions from worried H-1B holders about whether it's safe to travel internationally.\n\n\"Even if I write a three-page affidavit explaining how they're not going to have any trouble coming back to the United States, they're just not going to believe it, and they're staying here,\" Chiappari said. \"They're just not traveling.\"\n\nThe human cost is real: postponed weddings, skipped vacations, and delayed work travel.\n\n\"Employers,\" Kishore said, \"need to be prepared and agile for what's coming in the next few months.\"",

    "title": "From Social Security to jobs: America's oldest workers were anxious this year",
    "description": "This year, I've spoken to over 250 older Americans. Most, including those with sufficient savings, expressed anxiety about their financial situations,",
    "fullText": "Kathleen York, 80, hopes she doesn't run out of money by 2026.\n\nYork works as a contract industrial designer consultant in Illinois, but has not received a substantial pay raise since 2000. York, who is unmarried and doesn't have children, now works on her online business selling training videos in hopes of earning enough passive income to work less. If her business fails, she's worried about losing her home.\n\nShe spends two hours each day looking for work, knowing this year's frozen job market hasn't done her any favors. She recently learned the basics of AI and social media marketing to stay relevant.\n\n\"I can't afford to hire anybody else. I can barely afford myself,\" York said. \"We're trying to capitalize on what we know, what we can do, and keep up with our skills as best as we can.\"\n\nThis year, I've spoken to over 250 older Americans, many of whom are still working into their 80s. Most, including those with sufficient savings, expressed anxiety about their financial situations or those of their peers. Many said they felt more apprehensive this year than in the previous few — or at any point in their 60-year careers.\n\nInflation and tariff uncertainty led to temporary spending cutbacks, including at the grocery store. Reports of staff cuts at the Social Security Administration led to fear of benefits disruptions. Some states cut Medicaid, and a weaker, more highly competitive job market has made the job application process more cumbersome.\n\nMany felt that older Americans were often forgotten in policy decisions this year. Though some programming has resumed, federal funding for the Senior Community Service Employment Program was delayed for a few months starting in July. Some said it's become more apparent to them this year that there aren't enough financial resources set aside for more vulnerable older Americans.\n\n\"We put our elders out faster just because they're elderly, which is just a tragedy,\" said Joyce Johnson, 80, who works in visitor services for the Indiana State Museum. \"I regret that people are expected to retire and are no longer considered useful.\"\n\nOlder Americans are living longer and working later, and many fear their savings won't last them a decade from now. Some said they returned to work after retiring for extra financial security.\n\nEven with the stock market at all-time highs, many said their confidence in the economy is low, echoing near all-time lows in consumer sentiment. Prices for many items older Americans consume, such as medical care services, household insurance, and housing maintenance, have increased faster than overall inflation, according to the Consumer Price Index, leading many to trim their spending.\n\n\"As a country, we need to invest in supports for broad coverage for basic health and basic financial security, and to do that, it requires public investments in the ability for people to have a good, healthy start in life,\" said Dawn Carpenter, director of financial longevity at the Milken Institute.\n\nNearly all Americans in their late 60s and beyond collect Social Security, averaging about $2,000 monthly. About two-thirds rely on Social Security as a major income source, according to AARP.\n\nCost-cutting efforts under the Trump Administration brought changes this year at the Social Security Administration. Dozens of older Americans told Business Insider that they worried about benefit disruptions or not being able to reach a service representative. Benefits were not cut, though many said that they were more worried about their checks coming on time than in previous years, especially after enduring longer wait times for calls, a Washington Post analysis found.\n\nEarlier this year, online Social Security portals went down on multiple occasions, while some documents and display metrics became inaccessible. In February, the SSA announced plans to cut about 7,000 workers from its 57,000-person workforce, which led to an uptick in customer service calls. The short-lived Department of Government Efficiency had identified 47 SSA offices it planned to close or consolidate.\n\nDespite a brief uptick in call times, fears of major disruptions did not materialize. In a statement, an SSA spokesperson said the SSA reduced the year-over-year average answer speed to 15 minutes this year, down from 28 minutes last year, and served 65% more callers. The spokesperson also said visitor wait times at field offices declined by nearly 30% year-over-year, while the SSA decreased the backlog of pending initial disability claims.\n\n\"Under President Trump's leadership, Commissioner Bisignano continues to transform SSA into a model of excellence—an organization that operates at peak efficiency, delivers world-class service to every American, and protects and strengthens Social Security for future generations,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nOlder Americans also said they feared that their allotments would decrease in a few years, as Social Security's trust funds may begin depleting by 2033, potentially reducing benefits by about 20%. Some said they took Social Security years before turning 70, accepting a lower monthly allotment to have extra financial padding.\n\nAnother concern was that the cost-of-living adjustment would not keep up with their budgets — benefits will increase by about $60 next year due to a 2.8% COLA — while a few worried the raise could propel them above qualifying income thresholds for aid programs.\n\nLinda Kemp, 84, gets around $600 a month in Social Security, as she was a caregiver for her seven children for much of her working years. She moved into a house her son owns, where she pays for utilities with her Social Security income and her earnings working for her son's law firm. Social Security isn't, and likely will never be, enough for her to live on.\n\n\"I don't know what the options are for my future, and I have to figure it out,\" said Kemp, who lives in Florida. \"At 84, I'm slowing down and don't have all the energy I used to have.\"\n\nMedicare and Medicaid are lifelines for many older Americans, especially the roughly 45% of older households with limited savings, but recent shifts have magnified some recipients' anxiety. For millions of lower-income older Americans, Medicaid provides long-term care services. As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Medicaid spending could be cut by about $911 billion over the next decade. The bill included new work requirements for adults under 65, some of whom need long-term care support.\n\nPeople over 65 can qualify for Medicaid if they have limited assets and low incomes, though receiving benefits has sometimes come at a cost.\n\n\"This has created a demoralizing situation, because if you have the money, you have to spend it on long-term care, which is super expensive. If you don't have the money, then your life quality is going to suffer, but you're fully admitted into the long-term care facilities run by the government,\" said Mo Wang, a distinguished professor at the University of Florida's Warrington College of Business.\n\nIt's likely that many of the over 7 million low-income older Americans could have their benefits cut, burdening people needing nursing facility care or facing out-of-pocket medical expenses.\n\nMedicare premiums will also rise next year. Rising healthcare costs will push the monthly Medicare Part B premium up nearly 10% to $203, which will eat into Social Security benefits.\n\n\"When you get Social Security, they give you a 3% raise, and then Medicare takes a good portion of that because Medicare rates also increase,\" said Vince Scidone, 91. \"That 3% is not really a 3% raise.\"\n\nOlder Americans comprise the fastest-growing demographic in the workforce. Nearly 550,000 Americans 80 and older work at least part-time.\n\nThis year's labor market felt \"impenetrable\" and \"impossible\" to navigate, according to some older job seekers. Job growth slowed this year, while unemployment has risen above 4%. Despite some gains in healthcare, many industries remained stagnant, hiring few workers but holding off on major layoffs.\n\nSome in their 70s and 80s said the only jobs they could find were lower-paid, inflexible, or physically demanding. Very few landed a job with a comparable salary to what they held at the peak of their careers. Others resorted to opening a business or doing gig work. As a few older job seekers put it, ageism felt even more rampant this year.\n\nMany older workers cited AI as an extra stressor. Some said they've noticed more jobs this year requiring AI proficiency, while others with necessary qualifications felt they were instantly disqualified from tech-focused jobs because of their age. Some suspected AI screened out their applications.\n\nPeter Berg, a professor of employment relations at Michigan State University, said companies should do more to attract older talent through more flexible work schedules, hybrid opportunities, and intergenerational training — which could have longer-term economic benefits.\n\nLinda Styers, 83, worked as a contractor for the Arizona Department of Economic Security before she was laid off this year. She hasn't found any jobs in her few months of searching, including low-wage roles at retailers. She's frequently met with no response, and interviews have been sparse. While she has enough saved to cover her expenses, she wants \"frivolous money\" in case something breaks. She adopted four grandchildren in her 60s, and much of her past earnings have gone toward supporting them.\n\n\"Everything is so different with technology because it's so easy to apply to jobs instead of showing up\" to an in-person interview, Styers said. \"I guess I'll just hope for the best.\"",

    "description": "Rishab Jolly, a senior PM at Microsoft, uses AI tools to help him draft documents for work, and to speed up research for his podcasting hobby.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Rishab Jolly, 37, a senior program manager at Microsoft, based in Washington. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI landed a job at Microsoft as a program manager in 2017, after moving to the US for my MBA.\n\nI'm now a senior PM and find my role very fulfilling. My role involves developing ideas for products and features that enhance the customer experience, but also drafting plans that take the product from development to shipping to the customer. PMs are like the glue that brings different teams, across engineering, marketing, and business, together to work on each project.\n\nAs AI tools have become more prevalent, I've felt excited about the technology's potential to help me in my role. I consider myself an early adopter who's been upskilling to make sure I have AI as a new tool in my toolbox.\n\nHere are the ways AI helps me, both in my job and personal life, that are relatively easy to replicate.\n\nI studied computer science engineering for my bachelor's degree in India, where I'm from, before moving to the US in 2015 for my MBA. I also worked as a software engineer in India for four years, at companies using AI and machine learning in some form, before LLMs arrived on the scene. I wouldn't have called myself an AI expert, but I understood how the technology worked.\n\nAs AI tools have become more commonplace, I've used them to make my work faster and easier.\n\nPMs like me spend a huge amount of time in meetings. When I first joined Microsoft, I compiled notes manually to help me understand what I needed to action afterward. Now, I use can use AI tools for note-taking, which has given me back a lot of time to focus on more meaningful work, like strategic thinking and prioritization.\n\nPart of my job as a PM is to write documents that provide clarity to engineering teams about our goals and priorities. AI tools can help reduce the time spent on an initial draft. I then review, edit, and shape the AI-generated content myself, applying my judgment and experience before sharing the document with the team.\n\nAt work, I use the tools available at Microsoft, but in my personal life, I like experimenting and getting my hands dirty with a wide range of tools, from ChatGPT and Perplexity to Gemini.\n\nI started a podcast called \"Curious Souls\" in 2022 with my wife, who also works in tech, where we talk about our passion for product management, AI, fitness, and other topics with guest speakers. It's my hobby.\n\nResearching topics by asking PMs what they wanted to hear about and coming up with ideas for guests was very time-consuming.\n\nNow, I can speed up the process by prompting LLMs to search Reddit for hot topics that PMs are talking about and ask the chatbot to generate a script about the chosen topic. I can even generate an audio clip of the script to listen to while driving to the gym and ponder on how the podcast might sound if I used the script.\n\nI still dedicate between four and five hours each weekend to the podcast, but with AI, I'm able to accomplish much \n\nExperimenting with AI in personal projects has helped me understand where AI is helpful and where it isn't. For example, when I was using AI to generate podcast scripts, I found that it sometimes generated inaccurate outputs, like placeholder links that don't actually exist, so I usually treat AI output as a starting point and make sure to check it.\n\nAs a result, I'm more intentional when I use AI at work, knowing when to rely on automation and when human judgment is essential. I think it's worth experimenting with AI outside of work on low-risk projects, like planning hobbies or trips, before applying similar techniques professionally.\n\nInstead of being fearful of AI, I've decided to embrace it. In the future, I think PMs will be expected to know how to use AI to do things faster.\n\nEven with AI, I think the crux of the PM role will remain the same: being empathetic to customers and solving their problems. AI will make us more capable of solving those issues, and it can give us suggestions for how to approach issues, but the judgment calls will always be made by humans. It won't replace us, but it will be an essential tool to make our lives easier.\n\nMy advice to PMs is to embrace AI and get your hands dirty by experimenting with it, not just in your job, but in daily life. There's no way around it, and the sooner you start doing it, the faster you'll see benefits.\n\nDo you have a story to share about how you use AI at work?

    "title": "The state of media RTO: Here's what companies from Paramount to Netflix are telling workers heading into 2026",
    "description": "Remote work policies are changing at many large companies, including NBCUniversal and Paramount. Here's which media giants still allow remote work.",
    "fullText": "It was a year of RTO mandates in the media industry.\n\nThose issuing new guidance included media giants like NBCUniversal and Paramount Skydance, which this fall told thousands of employees to prepare to work in person four or five days a week in early 2026.\n\nWork-from-home policies haven't gone extinct at Netflix or its acquisition target, Warner Bros. Discovery, however. YouTube also has a flexible approach to remote work.\n\nHere's the latest on work-from-home and return-to-office policies at six major media and tech companies heading into 2026.\n\nParamount announced this year that it would be calling thousands of employees back to its New York and Los Angeles offices to work in-person five days a week starting January 5, 2026. The decision came in early September, less than a month after CEO David Ellison took charge after the Paramount-Skydance merger.\n\nStaffers who weren't up for in-person work were offered a severance package, which about 600 employees took, Paramount said in its third-quarter shareholder letter in mid-November.\n\nSome Paramount staff members can continue to work from home for now, including those based outside the US and those who were hired for fully remote roles. These employees who aren't assigned to the NY or LA offices will hear about \"Phase Two\" of Paramount's return-to-office plan in 2026, Ellison told employees in his September memo.\n\nParamount has been preparing its offices in NY and LA for an influx of remote workers by having employees in those areas work from home throughout December.\n\nComcast's NBCUniversal followed in Paramount's footsteps, telling employees to report to its office four days per week starting January 5, 2026. NBCU staffers can still work from home on Fridays.\n\n\"In-person work and collaboration spark innovation, promote creativity, and build stronger connections,\" NBCU operating chief Adam Miller said in a memo to staffers about the change.\n\nNBCU also gave a severance offer to employees who weren't willing to return to the office. Notably, this exit package was one-size-fits-all, meaning that it wasn't dependent on how long staffers had worked for the parent of Peacock and Universal Studios.\n\nDisney's return-to-office edict came nearly three years ago in early 2023, when CEO Bob Iger called most Mouse House staffers back to the office four days a week.\n\n\"It is my belief that working together more in-person will benefit the company's creativity, culture, and our employees' careers,\" Iger told employees at the time.\n\nHowever, Disney's remote work policy isn't always enforced equally. Some staffers have told Business Insider that their managers strictly enforce the four-day rule, while others have said that their bosses are more lax about badge swipes.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery requires most of its employees to work in person three days a week, with a work-from-home option on the other two days.\n\nHowever, that policy could change if the company behind HBO and Warner Bros. Studios were bought by either Netflix or Paramount Skydance.\n\nYouTube-parent Google's remote work policy may be confusing, but it offers a certain level of flexibility.\n\nThe tech giant's remote work policy lets employees work from home two days a week. It also offers a \"Work From Anywhere\" program, allowing staff members to telecommute for four weeks a year.\n\nGoogle revised that \"Work From Anywhere\" policy this fall, CNBC reported, citing an internal memo telling employees that using one so-called \"WFA\" day in a week would count as using an entire week. That's because these \"WFA\" weeks are intended for use when employees work away from their homes or worksites, and not as a substitute for a work-from-home or paid-time-off day.\n\n\"The policy was always intended to be taken in increments of a week and not be used as a substitute for working from home in a regular hybrid workweek,\" John Casey, Google's VP of performance and rewards, said of the change in a call with employees, CNBC reported.\n\nNetflix hasn't set a companywide work-site policy, meaning that employees can be fully remote, work in the office every day, or anywhere in between.\n\nEmployees' working locations can vary by team and position, which a Netflix spokesperson said gives teams \"the information and freedom to make decisions that best suit their type of work.\"\n\nThat relaxed remote work policy has long been common among tech companies, though that's starting to shift — even at video-conference giant Zoom.",

    "title": "The top 5 things that happened in the AI race this year",
    "description": "From bubbles to talent wars, 2025 was a turning point for AI's future.",
    "fullText": "2025 was unquestionably the year of AI.\n\nBig Tech shelled out roughly $400 billion on capex, a spending spree so extensive that some economists believe it staved off an overall recession. Nvidia became the first $4 trillion company. And AI content became inescapable, seeping into everything from Hollywood to campaign ads — even Mickey Mouse is getting into AI.\n\nIt hasn't been an endless party. Seemingly every few weeks, the stock market gets spooked that music is about to stop. Only Universal's Wicked for Good was more focused on a bubble.\n\nHere's a look back at the biggest AI storylines of 2025.\n\nIn an era of nostalgia traps, traders can't decide whether this is the Dot-Com era all over again.\n\nTech and AI CEOs can't agree either. In August, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman touched off concerns that a bubble had already formed. Since then, Bill Gates, Nvidia's Jensen Huang, Mark Cuban, and Mark Zuckerberg have offered their own similar or dissenting views.\n\nThe optimists' train of thought often ends up at the railroads and other breakthrough innovations that transformed the economy.\n\n\"There's been a lot of talk about an AI bubble,\" Huang said during Nvidia's third-quarter earnings call. \"From our vantage point, we see something very different.\"\n\nEven those at the forefront of AI's advancements express concern that some of their competitors are being too bold.\n\n\"There's genuine uncertainty, there's genuine dilemma, which we as a company try to manage as responsibly as we can,\" Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said in early December at a New York Times event. \"And then I think there are some players who are yoloing, who pull the wrist dial too far, and I'm very concerned.\"\n\nThe sheer size of spending is breathtaking.\n\nJPMorgan Chase concluded that AI-related spending contributed to 1.1% of GDP growth in the first half of the year.\n\nThe spending isn't likely to slow down.\n\nOver the last two years, Wall Street has underestimated capex growth, according to Goldman Sachs Research. Right now, Goldman said, the consensus estimate is that hyperscalers will spend $527 billion on capital expenditures next year.\n\nZuckerberg and OpenAI's leadership have separately suggested that the biggest risk is not spending enough.\n\n\"We want to be ahead of the curve,\" OpenAI President Greg Brockman said in a recent video posted on X. \"And the truth is, I don't think we will be, no matter how ambitious we can dream of being right now. I think demand will far exceed what we can think of.\"\n\nSilicon Valley's turf wars were a lot greener in 2025. Over the summer, the AI talent wars reached another level.\n\nPerhaps no company was as aggressive as Meta. Zuckerberg moved to poach top talent by wooing workers with tens of millions of dollars.\n\nAltman said OpenAI offered his best employees $100 million signing bonuses. Another top OpenAI official said Zuckerberg even made homesoup for one of his targets.\n\nOpenAI boasted that it largely fended off Meta's efforts, though ChatGPT co-creator Shengjia Zhao later joined Meta's Superintelligence Lab.\n\nEven the hyperscalers need some extra help to maintain their spending habits.\n\nThat's why Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle issued roughly $100 billion of bonds, powering global bond sales to another record year.\n\nThe interconnected nature of many AI deals has also raised concerns among some analysts and traders. Take Anthropic's pledge to spend $30 billion on Microsoft Azure to scale up Claude's compute. As part of the deal, Microsoft will invest up to $5 billion in Anthropic. Nvidia, whose chips are at the certain of this deal and many like, also agreed to invest up to $10 billion.\n\nNot all spenders are created alike, either. OpenAI, which is expected to be in the red by $9 billion this year, has about $1.4 trillion in spending commitments for AI data centers over the next decade. Unlike Google, Meta, and Microsoft, OpenAI doesn't have an established revenue base to fall back on, either.\n\nIt's why OpenAI CFO Sarah Friar sparked a brief firestorm when she appeared to suggest that the startup would want the possibility of a government bailout to backstop its data center bets. Friar walked back her remarks, and Altman later emphasized that OpenAI didn't believe in bailouts.\n\nOpenAI has led much of the AI-model race since the release of ChatGPT in 2022.\n\nThree years later, it was Altman who declared a \"code red,\" just over a month after OpenAI completed its corporate restructuring, aimed at giving it more freedom to raise money to fund its AI advancements.\n\nGoogle is now fighting back, and in the view of some observers, has caught up to OpenAI with the widely praised release of Gemini 3.\n\nCEO Sundar Pichai might as well have struck Steph Curry's signature celebration when he was asked what was next for his AI team.\n\n\"I think some folks need some sleep,\" Pichai said of the company's staffers following Gemini 3's release.",

    "description": "Something about Mormons in pop culture is scratching an itch for lonely, sober-curious, and economically anxious young Americans.",
    "fullText": "What do half-and-half-infused Dr. Pepper, group ketamine therapy, and a swinging scandal have in common?\n\nThey're all part of the new strain of Mormon mania sweeping American culture. When I asked \"Real Housewives of Salt Lake City\" star Heather Gay about the phenomenon last week, she called it \"undeniable and crazy.\"\n\n\"I just think that the Mormon moment is because we're taking over, we're industrial, we're enterprising,\" Gay said.\n\nTwo percent of the US population self-identifies as members of the Church of Latter-day Saints, but they've dominated our screens and conversations in 2025 like never before, from \"Dancing With The Stars\" to the heated discourse around influencers like Hannah Neeleman.\n\nIt's a phenomenon that's complicated for the church itself, which pointed Business Insider to a 2024 commentary post titled \"When Entertainment Media Distorts Faith.\"\n\n\"The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, like other prominent global faith communities, often finds itself the focus of the attention of the entertainment industry,\" the church wrote in its commentary. \"Some portrayals are fair and accurate, but others resort to stereotypes or gross misrepresentations that are in poor taste and have real-life consequences for people of faith.\"\n\nIndeed, social media and reality TV can't represent an entire religion, but the small window they provide into the culture has an undeniable appeal. The curated aesthetics, tight-knit families, and entrepreneurial spirit that shine through our screens are scratching an itch for lonely, sober-curious, and economically anxious young Americans. As we look ahead to 2026, forecasts predict more of the same: a frozen job market, elevated inflation, and high housing costs.\n\n\"I think there is a willingness to embrace Mormon culture from the outside in a way that did not exist 10, 15 years ago,\" said Talia Burnside, a philosophy and religious studies lecturer at Morgan State University.\n\n\"It's the perfect storm of social and political awareness, social media, and this trad wife tradition,\" said Gay, who has left the church and documented her separation in books and a new docuseries. \"The swing of the whole nation to something that Mormonism exhibits so well — life that seems perfect, and I think people are longing for that.\"\n\nIt's a familiar scene in the reality TV blockbuster \"The Secret Lives of Mormon Wives,\" which is popularly known for a swinging scandal, interpersonal hair drama, and ketamine therapy sessions. Utah-based cast members — picture-perfect influencers who frequently collaborate as a group known as Momtok — meet up for \"dirty sodas,\" gossip, and advice.\n\nThe distinctly Mormon treat — a soft drink flavored with syrups, creamers, fruits, sugars, and all sorts of other combinations — is gaining popularity nationwide. On a recent chilly December day, I took my own crew of coworkers to do the same in New York City, at a chain called Cool Sips. One coworker got a Dr. Pepper with coconut, half-and-half, and lime. They said they could see it as a feasible alternative to their coffee habit, which is fitting: Dirty sodas have been called the Starbucks for Mormons, who do not generally drink coffee. The sodas have also broken out from Mormon strongholds like Utah and Arizona. Quick-service industry publication QSR reported in October that original dirty soda brand Swig's revenue increased by 39% for the year, and the company is looking to expand its franchise presence further across the country. In a statement, the privately held Utah-based beverage maker said that it has grown to over 140 locations across 16 states, with a larger share of those outside Utah.\n\nA Swig spokesperson said that the company welcomes and serves \"people from all walks of life,\" and that \"where there is or isn't a certain cultural or religious presence doesn't factor into our growth strategy.\"\n\nCrumbl cookies, which was founded in Utah and whose creators have LDS roots, has launched collaborations with celebrities like Jimmy Fallon and Olivia Rodrigo. Crumbl told Business Insider in a statement that as a global company, it's committed to inclusion. The privately held company also still honors its Utah roots.\n\n\"We also support our employees by remaining closed on Sundays to allow time away from work,\" it said. \"Our growth has been driven by innovation, strong customer engagement, and the enthusiasm of our fans around the world.\"\n\nThe influencers hitting up businesses like Swig and Crumbl might also signify something Americans are craving — friend circles congregating around places to go that are not work, school, or a bar. Young Americans are drinking less and spending more time alone. They have fewer close friends than past generations. The appeal of a collective of friends and neighbors who — despite dramatic ups and downs — show up as a village, share cookies, and offer structure is even stronger right now.\n\n\"Even people who are not trying to necessarily embrace the kind of heteronormativity and patriarchal notions of the church are interested in the aesthetics of it and the community of it in having a built-in structure that enables them to have third spaces,\" said Morgan State's Burnside.\n\nFor the most part, famous Mormons of today don't necessarily use their platforms to focus on the religion. A good number of the cast members on shows like \"Secret Lives of Mormon Wives\" are no longer practicing, and they have varying levels of adherence to doctrines that forbid coffee, alcohol, divorce, and premarital sex.\n\nInstead, young, Mormon-adjacent influencers like Nara Smith and Hannah Neeleman are all about the lifestyle. They offer a more appealing glimpse into LDS culture than previous pop culture moments, such as Mitt Romney's presidential bid, the \"The Book of Mormon\" musical, and even the first Sherlock Holmes story in 1887.\n\nPeople are drawn toward what Margaret Toscano, a classics professor at the University of Utah, describes as an alternative that still fits within American cultural norms. In a time of high inflation, white-collar layoffs, and concerns about what an AI-driven world will bring, go-getters who run their own show — homemakers, influencers, writers, or business owners — are aspirational for many Americans.\n\n\"Mormon women have always had a sort of entrepreneurial aspect that even if they were stay-at-home moms, they would think of ways in which they could supplement the income of their family,\" said Toscano, who was excommunicated from the church for her writings on Mormon feminism.\n\nNext year is shaping up for more Mormon mania. Whitney Leavitt, one of the \"Mormon wives,\" has cultivated such a large fan base that she was cast on season 34 of \"Dancing With The Stars,\" and landed roles in the Broadway production of \"Chicago\" and in a rom-com. She'll now be headlining a show just down the block from where the satirical \"Book of Mormon\" musical is still running.\n\nAt the same time, Leavitt's castmate Taylor Frankie Paul is set to helm ABC's \"The Bachelorette,\" casting a Mormon as one of the country's most prominent eligible women.\n\n\"It's belonging, it's structure, it's comforting,\" Gay said of the appeal of Mormon influence. \"It's like the new Norman Rockwell in many ways because it's this version of consumerism and America that we are drawn to.\"",

    "description": "CEO turnover was high in the retail sector in 2025. Here are some of the large chains that are getting new leaders.",
    "fullText": "2025 may go down as the end of an era in retail.\n\nThis was the year that the longtime CEOs at two of the largest chains decided to hand the reins over to their corporate proteges.\n\nThe retirements of Walmart's Doug McMillon and Target's Brian Cornell come as the industry is facing an array of new (and long-term) challenges in the form of a global trade rebalancing, accelerated adoption of AI, and increasingly stretched US household budgets.\n\nFresh legs might be a welcome addition in this race.\n\nDozens of smaller retailers have taken the opportunity to shake up the C-suite as well.\n\nAnalysis from leadership consultancy Challenger, Gray & Christmas found that 43 retail companies announced CEO exits in the first 10 months of this year, up from 32 in the same period last year. A few more announcements have come through since.\n\nHere are some of the major retail chains that are getting a new CEO in the new year.\n\nWalmart said in November that the company's US division CEO, John Furner, would become president and CEO on February 1.\n\nLike outgoing CEO Doug McMillon, Furner has been with Walmart for decades, starting as an hourly associate and working his way up through the ranks.\n\nTarget said in August that chief operating officer Michael Fiddelke would succeed Brian Cornell on February 1, with Cornell remaining on the board as Executive Chair.\n\nFiddelke has been with the company for 20 years, starting as a finance intern and moving through roles in merchandising, finance, operations, and human resources.\n\nRV dealer Camping World said in December that founder Marcus Lemonis would step down as CEO on January 1, with company president Matthew Wagner taking over.\n\nWagner has been with Camping World since 2007, serving in numerous leadership roles before being appointed chief operating officer in 2023 and president in 2024.\n\nKraft Heinz said in December that it has snagged Kellanova CEO Steve Cahillane to take over from Carlos Abrams-Rivera on January 1.\n\nThe company will later split into two publicly traded companies, North American Grocery Co. and Global Taste Elevation Co., with Cahillane remaining in charge of the latter.\n\nCahillane has a long career leading consumer products companies like The Nature's Bounty Co. and Coca-Cola's Americas division. He also spent eight years with AB InBev.\n\nIn fairness, Michael Bender's transition effectively happened back in May, but Kohl's made it official in late November when the retailer said Bender would go from interim CEO to a permanent appointment.\n\nThat means Kohl's will start the new year with one less distraction under the leadership of a highly experienced retail executive who has already had a positive impact on the company.\n\nAthleisure brand Lululemon said in December that it was parting ways with CEO Calvin McDonald on January 31, but hasn't yet identified a permanent successor.\n\nIn the meantime, the company said board chair Marti Morfitt would expand her role to become executive chair, and that CFO Meghan Frank, chief commercial officer André Maestrini would serve as interim co-CEOs following McDonald's departure.\n\nParent company Seven & i Holdings said in December that CEO Joe DePinto would retire at the end of the year. The company's current president, Stan Reynolds, and chief operating officer, Doug Rosencrans, are set to serve as co-CEOs until a permanent successor is hired.",

    "description": "Joshua Nelken-Zitser, a senior reporter at Business Insider,  balanced his job with writing his first book. Consistency and celebrating small wins were key.",
    "fullText": "When I got my book deal with HarperCollins UK, I was thrilled that a childhood dream of becoming an author was coming true.\n\nThen, reality hit. I had less than a year to research and write an 80,000-word book.\n\nI had never taken on anything this big before, and certainly not alongside a full-time job. The prospect of juggling a 9-to-5 as a journalist with such a time-consuming passion project felt terrifying.\n\nBut by being intentional with my time and relying on a few key productivity habits, I've ended up with a book I'm proud of, all without losing sleep.\n\nI asked a couple of author friends how they balanced their day job with writing a book. One said he wrote in the twilight hours; the other woke up at the crack of dawn.\n\nI also looked for clues from people I interviewed at work, like 21-year-old Nathaneo Johnson, who ran a startup while studying at Yale and told me he often put in 18-hour days.\n\nIt became clear they found time for their passion projects by eating into their sleep. But sacrificing precious shut-eye was not something I was prepared to do.\n\nWhile some people are able to get by on less than the recommended seven to nine hours of sleep, I'm not wired that way. When I'm sleep-deprived, I am not my best self, nor my second or third best. I tend to get grouchy, lose focus more easily, and become more prone to getting sick.\n\nIf sleep was non-negotiable, I knew that I needed to carve out time elsewhere.\n\nMy free hours after finishing work and at weekends seemed like the most obvious place to claw back some time to write my book. Normally, those slots would be filled with episodes of \"Below Deck,\" reading fiction, or meals with friends.\n\nI worked out that freeing up roughly two hours on workdays and a sensible eight hours on weekends, by cutting down on my favourite activities for almost a year, would be manageable. Although it doesn't sound like much, the hours add up.\n\nOver a month, it would give me more than 100 hours to work with.\nAcross the eleven months between signing my deal and my deadline, that would come to almost 1,000 potential hours — the equivalent of 45 straight days of work without sleep.\n\nI didn't know how many hours it would take to finish my book, but the math showed that the workload would be feasible if I chipped away at it steadily, rather than cramming the writing into an impossible final stretch.\n\nIn the end, I doubt I racked up anywhere close to 1,000 hours (I took days off to relax, socialize, and vacation), yet I still managed to finish my first draft several weeks ahead of schedule.\n\nWhile writing a book is a creative process, I approached my schedule with scientific precision.\n\nI built a basic Google Sheet template to track my progress and created a formula that took into account my total word count target and the number of days I had left. This gave me a total number of words I needed to write each day to stay on track. I updated it after every writing session.\n\nWatching the total word count climb and the daily target shrink gamified the process, which was both motivating and reassuring. It also helped me judge when I was ahead of schedule and could therefore say \"yes\" to social plans.\n\nI saw how my incremental efforts were adding up. Consistency, I learned early on, was the only way to tackle such a project.\n\nI didn't follow my schedule perfectly: there were impromptu reporting trips, days I was too exhausted to work, and social plans I didn't want to turn down. But being consistent on average gave me enough wiggle room that these interruptions didn't derail my entire schedule.\n\nThroughout the process, I tried not to become a recluse. I didn't want to lose friends or my sanity along the way, so I made sure to have at least one thing each week to look forward to, whether it was hanging out with family or simply taking a long walk and enjoying a chai latte with friends.\n\nMarking milestones mattered, too. At a third, halfway, and two-thirds of the book, my husband and I either went out for dinner or popped open a bottle of Prosecco. And when I finally handed in my manuscript, we went on vacation.\n\nCelebrating the small wins gave me concrete, near-term rewards to work toward, which kept me motivated and protected my mental health. I locked in time for the gym, where I'd watch reality TV on the elliptical, to make sure that I was staying happy and healthy.\n\nI tried to adopt a \"work smart, not hard\" mindset, occasionally using online tools to make my life easier. Instead of wasting time formatting or tidying my chaotic notes, I'd prompt ChatGPT to turn them into clear, bullet-point summaries. I also used AI transcription software to write up interviews.\n\nSimple shortcuts like these saved me from tedious admin and freed up time for the stuff that actually mattered, like research and writing.\n\nI didn't get everything right. Some days I was well ahead of schedule, but pushed myself to work anyway, out of guilt for feeling lazy. A couple of times that brought me close to burnout and forced me to take a few days off from writing to recuperate. I should have listened to my body and paced myself.\n\nI also recognize that I had some advantages: I don't have kids or other caregiving responsibilities, my husband kindly took on more than his fair share of household chores, and my workplace allowed me a short period of unpaid leave to focus on my book.\n\nStill, being intentional with my time made juggling a full-time job and a book far more manageable than I could have ever imagined.\n\nI learned that I didn't need to sacrifice sleep to live out a lifelong dream, as long as I used my waking hours wisely.\n\nNow, with all that work behind me. I can simply look forward to Trauma Bonds being published in January 2027.",

    "description": "Bankruptcies are suddenly everywhere, from billion-dollar giants to small businesses to individuals. Experts are stumped at the breadth of industries.",
    "fullText": "Bankruptcies aren't just rising — they're suddenly everywhere.\n\nFrom billion-dollar giants to mom-and-pop shops to everyday individuals, bankruptcies are piling up across the US this year, with large corporate bankruptcies already hitting their highest level in 15 years.\n\nThe surge in bankruptcies highlights the growing financial pressures facing consumers and companies as costs climb amid a tougher borrowing environment.\n\n\"Rising costs, tighter credit conditions, and ongoing geopolitical volatility continue to exert pressure on households and businesses already facing financial strain,\" Amy Quackenboss, the executive director at the American Bankruptcy Institute, said earlier this month.\n\nUnlike past downturns, this wave of bankruptcies appears to be hitting nearly every corner of the economy. It's sweeping across a range of sectors in what one veteran bankruptcy attorney described as a strikingly \"unusual\" pattern.\n\nTypically, corporate failures tend to be \"industry sticky,\" meaning they cluster within the same sectors, Robert Stark, a partner at the law firm Brown Rudnick and chair of its bankruptcy and corporate restructuring practice group, recently told Business Insider.\n\nIn 2022, for example, he said there was the \"big crypto winter\" culminating in a string of cryptocurrency firm bankruptcies, including Sam Bankman-Fried's FTX.\n\n\"That was a sticky event — a lot in the industry kind of went through bankruptcy at the same time,\" Stark said. \"What we have now, which is the thing that I find kind of interesting, is I don't see as much stickiness as I'm used to seeing.\"\n\n\"Bankruptcies seem to be kind of all over the place,\" added Stark, who represents creditor groups in the 2025 bankruptcies of auto parts company First Brands and fintech startup Linqto, as well as the equity committee in the Chapter 11 case of genetic testing company 23andMe.\n\nStark said that he can't pinpoint a clear cause for the \"broad smattering of industries\" now in bankruptcy, but he called it \"unusual\" in his 30 years of experience and \"shockingly so.\"\n\nMajor corporate bankruptcies this year have included hospitality company Sonder, Spirit Airlines, Del Monte Foods, retailer Claire's, and CVS Health subsidiary Omnicare. Each, in court filings, listed more than $1 billion in liabilities, placing them among the largest bankruptcies of 2025.\n\nAccording to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, which tracks public and private companies of a certain size, bankruptcy filings climbed to 717 through November, topping last year's tally of 687.\n\nEven without December figures, 2025 has already logged the highest annual count for large corporate bankruptcies since 2010, when filings totaled 828, according to S&P Global.\n\nData from the intelligence firm shows that the industrials sector was the most distressed through November, with 110 companies filing for bankruptcy. The consumer discretionary sector followed with 85 bankruptcy filings, and healthcare was next up with 46 firms filing.\n\nThe spike in bankruptcies extends well beyond the corporate sphere, with an increasing number of small businesses also filing for bankruptcy, data shows.\n\nSmall businesses carrying $3,024,725 or less in secured and unsecured debt have the option to file for bankruptcy under Subchapter V of Chapter 11, which offers a more streamlined reorganization process.\n\nData from Epiq Bankruptcy Analytics shows Subchapter V filings, made by small firms and individuals, at more than 2,300 year-to-date through mid-December — a nearly 10% increase from the same period last year.\n\nIn November alone, Subchapter V bankruptcy filings totaled 223 — a 23% bump from the previous year, according to the American Bankruptcy Institute, which cited data from Epiq.\n\nIn addition to big and small businesses, individual bankruptcies have also increased amid rising costs.\n\nIndividual bankruptcy filings saw an 8% jump to 40,973 in November 2025, up from the 37,814 filings in November 2024, the data cited by ABI shows.\n\nLast month, there were 25,329 individual filings for Chapter 7, known as \"clean slate\" or liquidation bankruptcy, up 11% from the 22,871 filings recorded in November 2024.\n\nIndividual filings for Chapter 13, also called a \"wage earner's plan\" to repay all or part of someone's debts, accounted for 15,558 in November 2025, a 5% jump over the 14,865 filings in November last year, according to the data cited by ABI.\n\n\"For debt-burdened families and companies, bankruptcy remains a critical pathway to restore stability and rebuild toward a stronger financial future,\" Quackenboss, the ABI executive director, said.",

    "description": "We spoke to over 40 dietitians, nutritionists, longevity scientists, and gut health researchers this year. Here's their best diet advice.",
    "fullText": "On the surface, eating well seems simple enough. Eat whole foods. Cut down on ultra-processed snacks.\n\nIt gets more complicated once you start focusing on specific nutrients. Striking the right balance of protein, fiber, carbohydrates, healthy fats like omega-3s, vitamins, and minerals can feel like a full-time job.\n\nLuckily, there are people out there whose job this actually is. We spoke to over 40 registered dietitians, sports nutritionists, longevity scientists, and gut health researchers, all of whom shared their best diet advice with us this year.\n\nIncidentally, a lot of it overlapped. Many tips were aligned with the Mediterranean diet, considered the healthiest diet in the world. Plenty of meals also tackled multiple nutrients at once, making it easier to hit targeted nutrition goals.\n\nWhether your goal this year is to lose fat, build muscle, or boost your gut health, here's a meal plan full of bang-for-your-buck recipes — no guesswork required.\n\nIt doesn't hurt to get as many nutrients in as you can, as early in the day as you can.\n\nAt the same time, it's easy for common breakfasts — like cereal or bagels — to skimp on important nutrients like protein and fiber.\n\n\"A meal where people — I don't say under-consume protein — but that tends to be carbohydrate-heavy is breakfast,\" Stuart Phillips, a protein researcher, told Business Insider.\n\nEating a high-protein and high-fiber breakfast not only assures that you get some good nutrients in, but it also keeps you fuller for longer (especially after a morning workout).\n\nMost Americans don't consume enough fiber, which is crucial for good gut health, heart health, and weight management.\n\nKevin Hall, one of the US's top nutrition scientists, shared a great fiber tip with Business Insider earlier this year: Add more veggies to every bite. Even if you use ultra-processed ingredients (like store-bought salad dressing), packing in more vegetables helps you feel fuller and gets you closer to getting your recommended daily fiber intake.\n\nAnother great hack? Beans. Kylie Sakaida, a registered dietitian and cookbook author, previously told Business Insider that she often focuses on plant-based protein sources like beans and legumes because of their high fiber content.\n\nEating about one cup of beans a day can also help reduce inflammation and bad cholesterol. Plus, they make for a very cheap lunch.\n\nA few high-fiber lunch options include:\n\nEating enough protein in a day can be challenging, especially if you're trying to build muscle.\n\nMorgan Walker, a sports dietitian, said one of the best ways to hit your goals is to pack protein into your snacks. Personally, she likes to snack on smoothies with protein powder or low-fat Greek yogurt topped with fruit, nuts, and dark chocolate.\n\nSnacks are also great vehicles for eating more fiber. Dr. Susan Bullman, a cancer and gut health researcher, often snacks on pears, one of the highest-fiber fruits.\n\nAt the end of a long day, you want something simple that still helps you eat enough protein, fiber, complex carbohydrates, and healthy fats.\n\nSheet-pan dinners are one of the best and versatile ways to pull together a home-cooked meal without making it your whole evening. Roxana Ehsani, a sports dietitian, previously told Business Insider that she regularly bakes chicken, salmon, or sablefish along with vegetables like sweet potatoes or broccoli for a quick, nutritious meal.\n\n\"I chop a little bit, throw it in the oven, and then I can go shower and get ready,\" Ehsani said. \"It just gives me all those nutrients in one.\"\n\nUltra-processed foods, which are often highly palatable, can cause you to overeat about 500 calories a day, according to Hall. At the same time, he doesn't advocate for completely eliminating them.\n\n\"I don't stand on my soapbox to claim to know all the answers,\" he previously told Business Insider.\n\nCompletely restricting dessert isn't just difficult (and pretty miserable); it can actually backfire and prompt you to overeat. Tara Schmidt, lead dietitian for the Mayo Clinic diet, previously told Business Insider that better alternatives include eating smaller portions, making more nutritious swaps, and going out for dessert (instead of having a ready supply at home).\n\nSome great dessert options include:",

    "fullText": "THEY CALLED HER Gypset. The name, a combination of gypsy and jet set, wasn’t one she’d come up with herself; she’d gotten it from the writer Julia Chaplin, who coined the term in her 2009 book, Gypset Style, to evoke the vibe of bright young things who waft from Sayulita to Tangier to Topanga Canyon, crafting eclectic necklaces and draping yurts with Hermès cashmere. Athletic and glamorously bohemian, with glacial blue eyes and a silver ring in her nose, Gypset embodied her nickname’s ideal, always flying off to go skiing or hang out backstage at a rock show.\n\nHer given name was Lindsey Gleiche. She was 31 and lived in Huntington Beach, California, a short walk to the Pacific surf. Being a gypset is an occupation best suited for the independently wealthy, and Gleiche wasn’t that; she had a normal job, designing websites for Dollar General. But she was beautiful, friendly, and free-spirited.\n\nIn mid-2022, she met a man five years her junior, Riese Lenders, on a ski trip to Mammoth. Lenders was a pilot who was building his flight experience in Cessnas, turboprops, and small jets. He took her on jaunts to Las Vegas to see shows; to Arizona for her birthday; to the Bay Area for more music.\n\nIt was an intense but short-lived relationship. The two called it quits in spring 2023, but they continued to see each other occasionally, as exes sometimes do. On a Friday night in July, Gleiche was in her apartment getting ready to have dinner by herself when her phone rang. It was Lenders. He was about to take a spur-of-the-moment flight to Las Vegas with two older couples. The relationship was personal and professional—Lenders was working for Manuel Vargas, but the two were also friends. Perhaps that’s why Lenders was allowed to ask Gleiche if she wanted to tag along—they could make a night of it, hit some bars, and then fly home. What did she think?\n\nShe said yes right away. It was a nearly two-hour drive across the mountains to get to French Valley, the airstrip Lenders was departing from—a slog, but better than sitting at home on a Friday night.\n\nThe plane, a white Cessna Citation II jet with red and tan speed stripes, took off at 9:18 p.m. from the exurbs on the far side of the coastal mountains. Lenders, the pilot in command, sat in the front-left seat. To his right was his copilot, 32-year-old Vargas. Vargas had a successful real estate and landscaping business and flew helicopters, jets, and prop planes for both business and pleasure. He and his wife, Abby, had five kids, ranging in age from 1 to 14, and lived in a sprawling compound in Temecula. Abby was sitting in the back of the plane with Gleiche and the other couple, Alma, 51, and Abe Razick, 48. The Razicks had seven kids and owned several car dealerships in California and Arizona.",

She asked whether there was any way to make the student loan balance \"go away.\"\n\n\"Good Lord,\" personal finance expert Dave Ramsey said after confirming her age.\n\nLaRhonda told the hosts about her educational background. She said she holds three degrees: a bachelor's degree in multidisciplinary studies focused on criminal justice and religion, a master's degree in accounting, and a master's degree in divinity with a focus on theology and homiletics.\n\nEarn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nMissed Tesla?

LaRhonda said accounting jobs she explored in her area paid less than her current position.\n\nWhen co-host George Kamel asked whether she was working in accounting, LaRhonda said she was not. She said she works in logistics as a logistics specialist at Volvo Trucks.\n\nKamel questioned how her degrees were being used and said her current role was in logistics rather than accounting or divinity. Ramsey added that accounting skills can apply in logistics but said her multidisciplinary criminal justice degree was not part of her work.\n\nReferring to her age and loan balance, Ramsey said the numbers were \"disturbing\" and told her she had \"not monetized your knowledge base very well.\"\n\nTrending: An EA Co-Founder Shapes This VC Backed Marketplace—Now You Can Invest in Gaming's Next Big Platform\n\nThe discussion then shifted to income. Ramsey said the debt itself was not the main issue and that the figures do not work at her current income level. He said many people with a master's degree in accounting earn six figures, often starting between $100,000 and $125,000, and said moving into higher-paying roles would be required.\n\n\"I'd like you to be at 120 heading towards 220,\" Ramsey said. He added that Roanoke is \"not a backward town\" and said the area could support higher-paying roles. He also said supply chain positions generally pay more than $60,000.",

    "description": "More than 122 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles for Christmas and New Year's holidays this year.",
    "fullText": "More than 60 million people across the U.S. are under winter weather alerts as a powerful storm system targets the Northeast after Christmas, while a separate atmospheric river continues to batter California with flooding rain, high winds and dangerous conditions.\n\nForecasters warn the systems could disrupt flights and road travel as millions of Americans head home after the holidays.\n\nThe severe weather is expected to unfold over several days, with impacts stretching from the West Coast to the Northeast. Forecasters say conditions on the ground could change quickly, affecting everything from short drives to long-distance travel. Here’s what to know about the most affected regions.\n\nThe tristate area is expected to bear the brunt of a major winter storm on Friday, with snow, sleet and freezing rain forecast to create hazardous travel conditions. Accumulating snow is forecast to hit New York, Connecticut and New Jersey — where a state of emergency has been declared — beginning Friday through early Saturday. Some forecast models suggest that parts of New York and New Jersey will see up to 9 inches of snow, depending on the storm’s track.\n\nThe storm is already disrupting air travel in the region. As of Friday morning, at least 1,300 flights across the U.S. had been canceled, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware, with delays expected to grow as the storm intensifies.\n\nSnowfall totals of roughly 1 to 6 inches are expected across northeastern Pennsylvania, much of New Jersey, large portions of New York state and parts of southern and central New England, with higher amounts possible in elevated areas north and west of New York City.\n\nThe system is also expected to bring sleet and freezing rain to parts of Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia and northern Virginia. A wintry mix is likely in cities including Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington, D.C.\n\nOn the West Coast, California is facing dangerous conditions from a powerful atmospheric river system bringing flooding rain, high winds and heavy mountain snow to the state.\n\nWith atmospheric rivers, intense rainfall, and strong winds ahead, I’m declaring a state of emergency in Los Angeles, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, San Diego, and Shasta counties to activate emergency authorities and preposition resources to keep our communities safe. pic.twitter.com/C3eLImPkwx\n\n— Governor Gavin Newsom (@CAgovernor) December 24, 2025\n\nThe storm has already turned deadly, with at least three deaths reported in Southern California.\n\nParts of Southern California saw record-breaking rainfall earlier this week, with some locations seeing their wettest Christmas Eve or Christmas-week totals in decades.\n\nThe prolonged rainfall has increased the threat of mudslides, particularly in areas recently burned by wildfires. Officials have urged residents to avoid flooded roadways and to be prepared to evacuate if conditions worsen.\n\nAt higher elevations, the same storm system has delivered dangerous winter weather to the Sierra Nevada, making mountain travel hazardous across parts of California and western Nevada.\n\nAvalanche warnings were issued for parts of the Sierra as heavy snow and strong winds created unstable conditions in the mountains. Forecasters say 5 to 10 feet of snow could pile up in some high-elevation areas, significantly increasing avalanche risk and making travel especially dangerous through the weekend.\n\nThe Sierra Avalanche Center has issued a Backcountry Avalanche Watch for the backcountry areas around the Greater Lake Tahoe region as high avalanche danger is expected Thursday.

The American Automobile Association estimates that more than 122 million Americans are expected to travel at least 50 miles during the end-of-year holiday period, increasing the potential for widespread delays as severe weather moves across the country.",

    "description": "Joe Rogan has criticized President Donald Trump's recent behavior amid growing concerns about the politician's health.",
    "fullText": "Joe Rogan has criticized President Donald Trump's recent behavior amid growing concerns about the politician's health.\n\nThe famous podcaster described Trump's actions as \"nutty\" and suggested that the president may need a trusted right-hand man to help rein in some of his more extreme tendencies.\n\nThe White House recently released a statement claiming that the president was in good health. However, concerns about Donald Trump's health were renewed following his December 18 presidential address.\n\nIn a recent episode of his podcast, Joe Rogan hosted fellow comedian Tom Segura, and together, the two discussed several decisions the president has made in recent months.\n\nDuring the conversation, Segura suggested that some of Trump's recent actions, including the renaming of the Kennedy Center after himself, indicate that the president may be \"losing it.\"\n\nRogan responded by agreeing with Segura's assessment while also suggesting that Trump's \"nutty\" behavior could be attributed to his advanced age.\n\n\"I think everybody does when you get to a certain age,\" Rogan said about Trump, who turned 79 this year, per the Daily Mail.\n\nThe podcaster went on to blast Trump's new \"wall of fame\" of past presidents, in which he trolled his predecessor on a plaque as \"Sleepy Joe Biden\" and \"by far, the worst President in American History.\"\n\n\"There's nothing nuttier than the plaques underneath the president's names,\" Rogan said of the gesture. He asked further, \"How is this real? How are you allowed to do that?\"\n\nLooking ahead, Rogan said he believes Trump needs a trusted \"right-hand man\" who would advise him and help curb his more reckless tendencies.\n\nTo further his point, Rogan said it is even more necessary given everything Trump has faced in recent years.\n\nThis includes past accusations that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 election to help Trump, a notion Trump has repeatedly referred to as the \"Russian hoax.\" Rogan also referenced the assassination attempt on Trump that occurred prior to his second-term election victory.\n\n\"The stress of going through what that guy went through, where they were trying to jail him when they were going after him with the Russia thing, the Russia hoax, and all that sh-t,\" said Rogan.\n\n\"Like they were trying everything they could to destroy him, just that alone has gotta break your brain, and then they took a shot at him,\" he added.\n\nEarlier in the month, the White House attempted to clarify rumors about Trump's health in a statement to reporters.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, the White House press secretary, shared that the president's MRI was \"perfectly normal,\" his major organs \"appear very healthy and well perfused,\" and that he \"remains in excellent overall health.\n\n\"Everything evaluated is functioning within normal limits with no acute or chronic concerns,\" Leavitt said, per Politico. \"In summary, this level of detailed assessment is standard for an executive physical at President Trump's age.\"\n\nLeavitt also mentioned that the tests, which were carried out in October, were meant to determine whether the president had any issues.\n\nHowever, none were found, and the information is now being shared in a bid for transparency.\n\n\"I think that's quite a bit of detail in the effort of transparency,\" Leavitt said at the time. \"The president promised it… and we have it delivered.\"\n\nThe concerns about Trump's health were further renewed after his presidential address on Wednesday night, December 17.\n\nDuring the speech, the president took aim at his predecessor while also boasting about the success of his administration.\n\nHowever, Dr. Jonathan Reiner, the former cardiologist of the late Vice President Dick Cheney, claimed that Trump's manner of speaking during the address showed that there were some issues with his health.\n\n\"The pace of this address is manic,\" the veteran doctor wrote on X, which he followed with another tweet saying, \"I'm seriously concerned about the health of the president.\"\n\nHe later wrote, \"No one should be happy to see the president like this. He looks unwell.\"\n\nNetizens also supported Dr. Reiner's concerns about Trump's health in the comment section of his post.\n\n\"His behavior has grown even more erratic. In my view, the entire world should be concerned. No one in the industry could keep their job behaving this way,\" a user remarked.\n\n\"Slurring his words, unable to read, leaning onto the podium and clutching it with his left hand so he doesn't fall,\" another netizen wrote, adding, \"Trump is not well.\"\n\nHowever, some criticized Dr. Reiner's comments, accusing him of being more critical of Trump than his predecessor, former President Joe Biden.\n\nA person wrote, \"It's funny how unconcerned you were with Biden's health until the country was slapped in the face with it during the debate, and your only concern was possible sleep apnea? Go away.\"",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 27 (Reuters) - China passed a revised law that for the first time formally regulates unmanned aircraft, a move set to reshape the country's ​fast-growing drone and low-altitude economy sectors, according to state media on Saturday.\n\nThe Standing ‌Committee of the National People's Congress approved the changes under the Civil Aviation Law on December 27, adding provision ‌on airworthiness certification for drones that plugs a key regulatory gap.\n\nThe overhaul comes as China's low-altitude economy - a national strategic initiative focusing on commercial activities below 3,000 meters - is forecast to grow to more than 2 trillion yuan ($280 billion) by 2030, from a 1.5 trillion yuan ⁠in 2025, according to estimates from ‌the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Peking University and China's Civil Aviation Administration (CAAC).\n\nUnder the new rules, effective on July 1 next year, all entities ‍involved in the design, production, import, maintenance and operation of drones must obtain airworthiness certification.\n\nDrone manufacturers will be required to assign a unique product identification code to each unit, in accordance with relevant ​national regulations.\n\nChina has implemented \"interim regulations\" for unmanned aircraft starting from 2024, which stipulate that ‌civil unmanned aircraft must be registered under real names. The regulations also specify that micro, light, and small civil unmanned aircraft do not require airworthiness certification, while medium and large ones must apply to CAAC for airworthiness certification.\n\nAs China's drone market has rapidly expanded, oversight has lagged. In recent years, several cities have reported flight delays caused by illegal drone ⁠operations, prompting fines and other penalties.\n\nThe tighter requirements will ​affect manufacturers such as DJI, the world's largest ​consumer drone maker, and EHang, which produces passenger drones.\n\nDrone logistics have become an important driver of China's low-altitude economy, with 2.7 million packages containing everything ‍from hamburger lunches to ⁠life-saving medicine delivered throughout 2024, according to transport ministry data.\n\nE-commerce and food delivery leaders like JD.com and Meituan have long talked about investing in drone logistics to ⁠improve supply chain efficiency.\n\nJD Logistics has tested drone delivery networks in Jiangsu, Shaanxi, and Sichuan, and has said ‌drones can reduce shipping times for rural customers by up to 70%.\n\n(Reporting ‌by Sophie Yu, Casey HallEditing by Shri Navaratnam)",

    "fullText": "A Manchester man was fined more than £1,000 ($1,333) for illegally dumping a large pile of construction waste on public property.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Stephen Cawley, 36, pleaded guilty to the illegal waste-disposal incident that happened more than two years ago.\n\nOn April 17, 2023, a massive pile of household and construction waste was found on the land next to a footpath on Altrincham Road — the same road that Cawley lives on.\n\nInvestigators traced the mysterious pile of trash to a nearby property undergoing renovations, which investigators learned was a job contracted to Cawley's building company, Builder Boys Ltd.\n\n\"So he dumped it on his own f****** road?\" one commenter asked in disbelief under a Reddit post that shared the BBC report.\n\nUsing public roads to improperly dispose of commercial or household waste is not only illegal and an eyesore, but it also costs taxpayers money. The city has to dispatch a cleanup crew to remove the trash from the roads so they are safe to use again.\n\nMany Reddit commenters took issue with the fact that Cawley, who had generated the massive pile of waste and debris through his building business, pushed the government to foot the bill.\n\nHe left the trash uncovered and unaddressed, which could have sent loose debris into waterways, polluting our oceans, or into nearby animal habitats.\n\nCawley was ordered to pay £320 to the Manchester Magistrates' Court, as well as £750 for the cost of illegal dumping. The court also imposed an additional £128 victim surcharge.\n\n\"Flytipping remains a selfish and disgusting crime which impacts our communities and environment,\" said councillor Lee-Ann Igbon, per BBC.\n\nDo you think the construction industry is too wasteful?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nProtecting public spaces and the environment from illegal waste dumps ensures that everyone has the chance to experience the natural world as it should be.\n\nAnother Reddit commenter grumbled about the punishment issued.\n\n\"Still seems cheaper than getting rid of it properly,\" another Reddit user added.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "LARNACA, Cyprus (AP) — Photis Gaitanos’ rough fingers adroitly untangle the venomous spikes of a lionfish from a net, throwing the exotic-looking creature into an ice-filled rubber bin along with other fish from the day’s catch.\n\nUnlike a few years ago when he would have mostly caught local staples as sea bream, red mullet or bass, the veteran fisherman now hunts for the invasive species that made its way from the Red Sea to the warming waters of the Mediterranean,\n\nLionfish, with their red and orange-hued stripes and antennae-like barbs that menacingly ward off enemies, threaten to decimate indigenous fish stocks, wreaking havoc on the livelihoods of the roughly 150 professional fishermen in Cyprus.\n\nThe prickly fish has even made its way as far north as the Ionian Sea, where Italian authorities have asked the public to photograph and report sightings.\n\nThe East Mediterranean has also seen another invasive Red Sea fish in the last decade: the silver-cheeked toadfish. Known as an eating machine whose powerful jaws cut through fishing nets, decimating fishermen’s catch, it has no natural predators off Cyprus, allowing its population to explode.\n\nThat toadfish also produces a lethal toxin, making it inedible.\n\nGaitanos, the 60-year-old fisherman, has fished for years in an area a few kilometers off the coastal town of Larnaca, once famous for its fishing bounty. Now, he says, it’s been more than two years since he’s caught a red mullet, a consumer favorite.\n\n“I have been practicing this profession for 40 years. Our income, especially since these two foreign species appeared, has become worse every year. It is now a major problem (affecting) the future of fishing,\" he said. \"How can it be dealt with?”\n\nEurope’s General Fisheries Commission for the Mediterranean says with the sea warming some 20% faster than the global average, the presence of invasive species “is progressively increasing in the western basin.”\n\nModels show that warmer seas as a result of climate change could see lionfish swarm the entire Mediterranean by the century’s end. Warmer waters and an expanded Suez Canal “have opened the floodgates” to Indo-Pacific species in general, according to Cyprus’ Fisheries Department.\n\nThe European Union’s Fisheries Commissioner Costas Kadis, a Cypriot himself, told The Associated Press that more frequent and intense extreme weather, often linked to climate change, could make the Mediterranean more hospitable to invasive species.\n\nAnd that’s taking a heavy toll on Europe’s fishing industry as fishermen’s catches diminish while their costs shoot up as a result of repairs to fishing gear damaged by the powerful intruders.\n\n“The native marine biodiversity of a specific region, as in the case of Cyprus, faces heightened competition and pressure, with implications for local ecosystems and industries dependent on them,” said Kadis.\n\nGaitanos, who inherited his father’s boat in 1986, is not sure the fishermen’s grievances are being handled in a way that can stave off the profession’s decline.\n\n“We want to show the European Union that there’s a big problem with the quantity of the catch as well as the kind of fish caught, affected by the arrival of these invasive species and by climate change,\" he said.\n\nSome EU-funded compensation programs have been enacted to help fishermen. The latest, enforced last year, pays fishermen about 4.73 euros ($5.5) per kilogram (2.2 pounds) to catch toadfish to control their number. The toadfish are then sent to incinerators.\n\nAnother project, RELIONMED, which began in 2017, recruits some 100 scuba divers to cull lionfish around wrecks, reefs and marine protected areas. The Cyprus Fisheries Department says surveys show that frequent culls could buy time for native species to recover, but it’s not a permanent fix.\n\nWhat local fishermen are hoping will catch on with the fish-loving public is a new campaign to serve lionfish as a delicacy after its poisonous spines are carefully removed.\n\nKadis, the EU Fisheries commissioner, said a social media campaign that began in 2021, #TasteTheOcean, had top European chefs and influencers plugging invasive species as a tasty alternative to the more commonly consumed fish. Renowned Cypriot chef Stavris Georgiou worked up a lionfish recipe of his own.\n\nFor most Cypriots, local taverns with their rich meze menus that feature numerous plates different fish is the way to go. Although eating lionfish has been slow to catch on, many tavernas and fish restaurants have started to introduce it as part of their menu.\n\nThe bonus is that lionfish is now priced competitively compared to more popular fish like sea bass. At the Larnaca harbor fish market, lionfish cost less than half as much as more popular fish like sea bass.\n\n“By incorporating invasive species such as lionfish into our diet, we can turn this challenge into an opportunity for the fisheries sector and at the same time help limit the environmental threat caused by these species,” Kadis said\n\nStephanos Mentonis, who runs a popular fish tavern in Larnaca, has included lionfish on his meze menu as a way to introduce the fish to a wider number of patrons.\n\nMentonis, 54, says most of his customers aren’t familiar with lionfish. But its meat is fluffy and tender, and he says it can hold up against perennial tavern favorites like sea bream.\n\n“When they try it, it’s not any less tasty than any other fish,\" he said.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHad Marcell Ozuna not had the season he did in 2025, he likely would be the most sought-after DH in this free agency cycle. However, that isn’t the case, and teams currently view him as a potential risk to sign. The Atlanta Braves attempted to trade him several times last season, but he refused every offer.\n\n“It’s possible that while Anthopoulos was discussing trades, he couldn’t agree on a deal that Ozuna’s agent could also sign off on. Just because Ozuna is leaving the deadline out of his hands doesn’t mean the 10-5 rights go out the window. He could have simply handed over those rights to his agent for the discussions,” SI’s Harrison Smajovits wrote.\n\nWith Ozuna aging and other factors at play, he isn’t an especially appealing free agent candidate so far this offseason.\n\n“The problem Ozuna faces now is that he has only gotten older, his performance last season was subpar at best, and the teams that were previously considered to be landing spots for him feel unlikely to pursue him this offseason especially with how more and more organizations are treating the DH position,” HTHB’s Eric Cole wrote.\n\nFanSided’s Christopher Kline believes the Cleveland Guardians could sign Ozuna to a low-risk deal, adding protection in the lineup alongside José Ramírez.\n\n“This Cleveland Guardians team desperately needs more pop in the heart of the lineup. Kyle Manzardo made a strong first impression as a rookie. Chase DeLauter and Travis Bazzana are coming behind him as top prospects who can rip it. But even if it's a one-year deal, Ozuna has the goods to protect José Ramírez in the heart of the order and pop a few more dingers than Cleveland fans are used to,” Kline wrote.\n\nThe Guardians won the AL Central last year after a late-season comeback against the Detroit Tigers. Ozuna, meanwhile, just wants to finish his career on a strong note after a difficult 2025 season.\n\nCleveland is a playoff-caliber team that could benefit from Ozuna’s bat and veteran presence in the clubhouse. This type of one-year deal could pay major dividends for the Guardians.",

    "fullText": "Erik Spoelstra sees potential big role for Nikola Jovic after promising performance originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Miami Heat have had a rollercoaster season with a 16-15 record after 31 games. Despite some disappointment after the hot start to the year, there were some promising signs for head coach Erik Spoelstra and the Heat.\n\nPlayers like Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Nikola Jovic have carved out roles for themselves, as the former has become a top scorer for Miami. On the other hand, Jovic has continued to improve as a role player, which Spoelstra appreciates.\n\nWhen people speak about the Heat, most people will bring up the stars, which are Bam Adebayo, Tyler Herro, and Norman Powell. They also have Kel'el Ware, who is the most prominent young player on the roster.\n\nIt is a promising roster because they have a good mix of talented veterans and youngsters. Spoelstra always wants to make a difference with his team, and he feels Jovic's performance against the Atlanta Hawks was quite impressive. In just 21 minutes, he had 10 points, seven rebounds, and four assists off the bench.\n\nMore: Heat’s Nikola Jovic believes the team is better than their current record shows\n\nSpoelstra can be a tough coach to impress, as seen with his dynamic with Ware. However, Jovic is a different story because he has been one of the Heat's long-term projects for the past few years. Spoelstra is seeing the results, so he sees a bright future ahead.\n\n\"I think this was a good step for him to contribute and impact the game without making shots. You didn't see the body language stuff when he misses open 3s or layups/turnovers. He got onto the next play. He did some very good things. When he gets in better rhythm, I have no doubt the shooting will be better,\" Spoelstra said about Jovic's game.\n\nMoving forward, Jovic could be one of the most impactful players on the roster. Of course, Jovic is not a star player like some of his teammates, but he will do his best to be impactful.\n\nSpoelstra has long-term plans, and if Jovic continues to play like this, he will be part of them. It will be a promising future for the Heat and their fans, which should be quite exciting.\n\nWild proposed trade has Heat landing 3 future Hall of Famer\n\nBam Adebayo is going with the flow with his recent slump for the Miami Heat\n\nPacers sign former Ohio State, Wisconsin star but release James Wiseman to make room\n\nLuke Kornet found success by letting go: Inside Spurs big man's evolution away from 3-point specialist\n\nAce Bailey injury update is bad news for Jazz rookie",

    "fullText": "Real Oviedo are in dire need of improvement in the second half of the season, and have made their first signing of the January transfer window to that end. Los Carbayones currently sit second-bottom, with just 11 points to their name, and a gap of five to make up in order to get themselves to safety.\n\nTheir first signing of the winter window, and indeed the Guillermo Almada era, will be a compatriot of their new manager. Midfielder Nicolas Fonseca has been brought in on loan until the end of the season from Club Leon in Mexico.\n\nAfter spending time at AC Milan as a youngster, Fonseca returned to Uruguay to play for River Plate (URU) and then Montevideo Wanderers, before a €2.07m to River Plate across the water in Buenos Aires. In January last year, Fonseca made a €2.15m switch to Club Leon, where he has 15 appearances, of which 13 were starts.\n\nWith six caps to his name, Fonseca is also hoping to earn himself a spot in Marcelo Bielsa’s Uruguay squad for the 2026 World Cup next summer.\n\nUndoubtedly Real Oviedo’s biggest need is up front. Veteran Venezuelan forward Salomon Rondon has struggled to replicate his form from yesteryear in La Liga, while Federico Vinas has also been estranged from goals. Between them, just three goals have come, contributing to their league-wide lowest total of seven. Oviedo have been linked with Bournemouth forward Enes Unal, who is seeking more game time in the second half of the season.\n\nOviedo have rotated through their midfield options this season, but Fonseca will be competing for a spot with Leander Dendoncker, Alberto Reina, Santiago Colombatto, Kwasi Sibo, Luka Ilic, Brandon Domingues and Santi Cazorla. There has been a suggestion that Sibo could be on the move in January too.",

    "description": "Should FC Bayern sell Leon Goretzka in January?",
    "fullText": "Another club has emerged as a contender to acquire oft-maligned Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka — Napoli.\n\nHowever, one obstacle is that Napoli wants Goretzka…now.\n\nWhile that would make Goretzka’s vocal legion of haters happy (Come on, show your faces in the comments! 🤣), the Bavarians would probably not thin out their depth for the stretch run of the season:\n\nNapoli are looking to strengthen their midfield in January and see Leon Goretzka as the preferred candidate. However, Bayern are unlikely to sell Goretzka mid-season even though his contract will expire in the summer. Therefore the Italian champions are looking at other names like Kobbie Mainoo, Soungoutou Magassa and Lorenzo Pellegrini.\n\nGoretzka seems to have a lot of clubs eager to bring him now right now. For his sake, let’s hope that remains the same for the summer and he can land on his feet after leaving Bayern Munich — which seems inevitable at this point.\n\nBayern Munich striker Nicolas Jackson earned a place on WhoScored.com’s AFCON Team of Matchday 1 where he had a brace for Senegal:\n\nNicolas Jackson in @WhoScored's AFCON Team of Matchday 1 pic.twitter.com/xqCsxYX6i8\n\n— Bayern & Germany (@iMiaSanMia) December 26, 2025\n\nMeanwhile, Luis Díaz and Dayot Upamecano were the only two Bayern Munich players to earn a spot on Goal’s European Team of the Season (so far):\n\n– @goal's European Team of the Season so far with Dayot Upamecano and Luis Díaz pic.twitter.com/grbp9IZxHs\n\n— Bayern & Germany (@iMiaSanMia) December 26, 2025\n\nBayern Munich has been closely linked to Crystal Palace center-back Marc Guéhi for months now, but Manchester United could be looking to swoop in and steal the England international:\n\nOne of the top targets remain Jarrad Branthwaite. The Everton defender’s Premier League experience, physical presence, and improving composure in possession make him a strong candidate for Amorim’s system.\n\nAnother key option is Marc Guéhi. Beyond his defensive quality and leadership, Guéhi also helps United meet homegrown player requirements, an increasingly important factor in squad construction.\n\nUnited are also casting an eye toward the future. Honest Ahanor, the highly rated 17-year-old from Atalanta, is firmly on the club’s radar. Seen as a high-upside project, Ahanor fits Amorim’s preference for recruiting young talents who can be developed internally.\n\nOn the left side, Nathaniel Brown is another name being considered. His athleticism and comfort pushing forward make him an appealing option in a system that demands attacking output from wide defenders.\n\nSure, Bayern Munich has met with Guéhi’s representatives multiple times, but that does not guarantee anything. As a pending free agent, the wild west opens up for Guéhi in just a few days. Will Bayern Munich be ready for a battle?\n\nFormer Bayern Munich star David Alaba looks like he is in his final months with Real Madrid:\n\n🚨⚪️ Real Madrid and David Alaba are still expected to part ways in summer 2026.\n\nNo changes at this stage, still no formal of official communication between the parties but clear indications. pic.twitter.com/8jEhhnGZQ3\n\n— Fabrizio Romano (@FabrizioRomano) December 26, 2025\n\nAlaba’s exit from Bayern Munich was not exactly smooth, but he is still a beloved figure in the club’s history. As far as Alaba and Real Madrid go, well, Total Recall has a line for that:\n\nFormer Bayern Munich star and current FC Barcelona striker Robert Lewandowski was once rumored to eschew the thought of going to Saudi Arabia.\n\nBarcelona striker Robert Lewandowski is keen to continue playing for as long as possible and is tempted by a two-year deal in Saudi Arabia, according to AS. The 37-year-old’s agent, Pina Zahavi, is set to meet Saudi Pro League representatives about a deal that would compete financially with the one currently on the table from MLS’ Chicago Fire. Meanwhile, the Spanish champions are keeping a watchful eye on the form of Levante striker Etta Eyong, according to Fabrizio Romano, with the forward enhancing his reputation by scoring the winning goal for Cameroon against Gabon at the Africa Cup of Nations on Christmas Eve.\n\nThe money could be overwhelming, but it still seems like a longshot that the “sometimes Foul Pole” would move his family to to Saudi Arabia at the moment.\n\nManchester United defensive midfielder Casemiro will be on the move…but to where? MLC and the Middle East are both eager to bring him in:\n\nCasemiro’s future is approaching a decisive moment as his Manchester United contract runs toward its conclusion, with growing interest from Major League Soccer and the Middle East shaping the next chapter of his career. The Brazilian midfielder remains a respected figure at Old Trafford, but any extension beyond the current deal is far from straightforward, sources close to the agents industry have informed CaughtOffside.\n\nWhile a new contract remains on the table, United are reluctant to activate a 12-month option at Casemiro’s existing salary level, making it clear that any stay would require a significant pay cut. That stance has opened the door to serious conversations elsewhere. In MLS, Columbus Crew have emerged as a particularly strong option. Columbus would likely need to structure a deal outside the designated player (DP) slot, placing Casemiro on a lower wage band supplemented by incentives, bonuses, and appearance-related triggers.\n\nThe financial contrast becomes stark when compared with Saudi Arabia. Interest from Al Nassr, Al Ittihad, and Al Hilal is described as firm, with all three capable of offering substantially more aggressive salary packages than any MLS side. A Saudi move would likely include a sizeable signing bonus, a high weekly wage, and performance-related add-ons.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "description": "As we close out 2025, why not look back at an excellent year of college and amateur golf.",
    "fullText": "Another year of college and amateur golf is in the books.\n\nAs the year winds down, it's time to look back at some of the best moments throughout the year in the college and amateur game. Whether it was teenagers breaking out on a national stage or established players making history in their own journey, it was an exciting year for fans who follow golf up-and-coming stars.\n\nLet's take a look back at some of the biggest stories of the year, starting with perhaps the biggest breakout of them all.\n\nFirst, Howell won medalist honors at a U.S. Open qualifier to earn his first major championship start. Then he won medalist honors at the U.S. Junior Amateur. That wasn't enough. He got into the U.S. Amateur match-play bracket via a playoff and proceeded to win the biggest amateur championship in the world and represented the U.S. on the Walker Cup team, going 2-1. Mason Howell is here.\n\nAs time goes on, we'll be able to look at this result and truly measure its significance in the sport, but Northwestern knocking off No. 1 Stanford in the championship match at the NCAA Women's Golf Championship is arguably the biggest upset in women's college golf history. Anything can happen in match play, and Northwestern pulled off the miraculous win for its first championship in school history.\n\nIt's hard to describe what an incredible week it was at the Walker Cup. Cypress Point is one of the cathedrals of golf in the entire world, ranked No.1 on Golfweek's Best list of Classic Courses in the U.S., and it was a perfect venue for many of the best amateurs in the U.S. and Great Britain & Ireland to battle it out. The crowds were spectacular, sights breathtaking and Cypress Point got to show off in primetime. Hard to find how it wasn't an unforgetable week for players and fans alike.\n\nFrom one Pacific coast beauty to another, Bandon Dunes was spectacular theater for the 2025 U.S. Women's Amateur, but perhaps it's fitting that Megha Ganne found a way to come out on top. She's long been a star in the game of golf, but her triumph at Bandon Dunes was her crowning achievement on one of the biggest stages in golf. She was spectacular all week in Oregon and got to hoist the trophy after a dominant week.\n\nLuke Clanton was a professional for more than half the year, but the first five months of 2025 belonged to Clanton in the amateur game. The former No. 1 earned his PGA Tour card thanks to his play in those events, and he also dominated at the collegiate level, winning the Ben Hogan Award and nearly claiming the Fred Haskins, too. Now, it seems he's due for his first PGA Tour win in 2026.\n\nFrom one former Florida State No. 1 amateur to another, Woad was a constant presence near the top of leaderboards all year. So much so, that she won the Women's Irish Open as an amateur and then finished third at the Amundi Evian Championship, locking up her LPGA card and turning pro the next week. And then guess what? She went and won the women's Scottish Open. She won the 2024 Augusta National Women's Amateur to put her on the map, but she was destined to be a star long before.\n\nAnd how did Woad get her card? LEAP is how. The program, which is similar to PGA Tour University in that college players earn points based on finishes in top college and amateur events to provide a pathway directly to the Tour, had a stellar debut with Woad earning her card after the third-place finish at the Amundi Evian. Don't be surprised to see Kiara Romero earn her LPGA card via the same pathway in 2026.\n\nThere was a college golfer who made Division II history this fall. Drew Zielinski, a senior at Lee University, won the Golfweek Fripp Island to Bermuda Invitational, becoming the first player to win a D-II event that offered an exemption into a PGA Tour event. He later played in the Butterfield Bermuda Championship, where he finished T-15 in the field in birdies made but just missed the cut.\n\nTwo golfers at Purdue Fort Wayne jumped into an icy pond to save a man from drowning. What an incredible story of heroism.\n\nNiel Phillips had a day he will never forget in October. He aced the same hole not once, but twice in the same day. Phillips began the first round on Monday on the 182-yard hole, and he pulled a 6-iron and made it on his first shot of the day. He shot even-par 72 in the opening round before returning to the eighth hole in the afternoon for the second shotgun start of the day. This time, he hit a 7-iron. Different club, same result. His second ace in about 6 hours in the same spot where he made the first one.\n\nSeve. Jose Maria. Sergio. Jon. Carla. Carla Bernat Escuder added her name to the list of Spanish legends who have won at Augusta National, becoming the first woman from Spain to win the Augusta National Women's Amateur.\n\nIt's coming. A 59 in a college golf event is going to happen soon, possibly in the spring. It happened early this year in a practice round, with Utah's Sergio Jimenez accomplishing the feat. But how long until it happens in competition?\n\nThis article originally appeared on Golfweek: Looking back at the best moments from college and amateur golf in 2025",

    "description": "ESPN personality Kendrick Perkins said that the time has come for the Lakers to make a bold move with LeBron James.",
    "fullText": "After missing the first 14 games of this season due to sciatica, LeBron James has looked more like his usual self over the last few weeks. In his last seven games, he has averaged 25.6 points, 5.7 rebounds and six assists a contest while shooting 53.3% from the field and 35.3% from 3-point range.\n\nBut his performance on Christmas Day in the Los Angeles Lakers' 119-96 loss to the Houston Rockets left something to be desired. He took a modest 13 shot attempts, making seven of them, and ended up with 18 points and five assists. He didn't assert himself that much, and according to one ESPN personality, his body language was poor.\n\nKendrick Perkins said that James' body language was \"awful,\" and he seemed to suggest that the superstar needs to be traded.\n\n\"When he's not engaged or he feels some type of way, it speaks in his body language. Last night his body language was awful. He was not engaged, he was pouting, he was moping, he was walking up and down the damn floor, he was complaining.\n\n\"LeBron and the Lakers -- their relationship has run its course, and they need to figure out a solution and the solution is not him being in a Los Angeles Lakers uniform. ... He knows that this roster is not built. ... He knows that this roster don't have enough.\"\n\nJames does have somewhat of a history of displaying poor body language when things haven't gone well for his team. Right now, things aren't exactly going well for the Lakers.\n\nAfter starting the season 15-4, they have lost six of their last 10 games, and their lackluster defense is being exposed by the rest of the league. Following Thursday's loss, coach JJ Redick publicly called out the lack of effort and execution by his players and accused them of not caring enough.\n\nEven worse, Austin Reaves, who has arguably been playing at a borderline superstar level this season, will now be out for at least four weeks due to a Grade 2 gastrocnemius strain. He recently missed three games due to a left calf strain, and he didn't play in the second half of Thursday's game after experiencing soreness in that same left calf.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Kendrick Perkins says Lakers should make bold LeBron James move",

    "fullText": "Myles Garrett guarantees record-breaking sack ahead of Steelers originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Browns are out of the playoff picture, but they still have a chance to play spoiler and shake up the AFC North when they face the Pittsburgh Steelers in Week 17. Individually, however, Myles Garrett has plenty left to chase.\n\nThe star edge rusher sits one sack shy of the single-season record shared by Michael Strahan and T.J. Watt. If that milestone comes Sunday, it could arrive in historic fashion — potentially against 42-year-old Aaron Rodgers, a future first-ballot Pro Football Hall of Famer like Garrett himself. A sack of Rodgers in a record-breaking moment would instantly rank among the most memorable in NFL history.\n\nThat scenario, of course, hinges on who starts at quarterback. Rodgers is not listed on the injury report, though he is dealing with a fractured wrist on his non-throwing hand. If he were a late scratch, Mason Rudolph would take over — a familiar and infamous matchup for Garrett.\n\nEither way, Garrett isn’t hedging. He has guaranteed a sack on Sunday, regardless of who lines up under center, adding that there is no bad blood between him and Rudolph.\n\n“I don’t think there’s a lot of history between the two of us,” Garrett told reporters Friday. “But whether I get it against him or I get it against Aaron, it makes no difference to me. It gets got.”\n\nGarrett is also chasing a much larger piece of NFL history. The star pass rusher, who turns 30 on Monday, believes he has a realistic shot at breaking Bruce Smith’s all-time sack record within the next five years. Smith finished his 19-year career with 200 sacks, while Garrett already has 124.5.\n\n“At the pace I am now, I can get it in like five years,” Garrett said. “Five years is right at that time to think I’ll go and hang the cleats up. So I do think about if I can do it. And I think I’m only getting better, I think the numbers will only continue to look similar to how they are right now. So I’ll be knocking on his door pretty soon.”",

    "fullText": "Hornets coach Charles Lee is excited about Tidjane Salaun's recent development originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nTidjane Salaun has not been the most popular player on the Charlotte Hornets roster since he was selected sixth overall in the 2024 NBA Draft. Considering he was chosen with such a high pick, many people expected him to be a star-level talent.\n\nUnfortunately for the Hornets and their fans, Salaun might not pan out as the star player they were expecting. However, he is working hard to become a productive contributor to Charles Lee's system with the Hornets.\n\nConsidering Salaun is only in his second NBA season, he has a lot of room to grow. He is only 20, so his development is still pending. Most players' development is not linear, so these recent performances might be a good sign for the Hornets moving forward.\n\nCoach Lee would love to see Salaun further improve because he is a big believer in the 20-year-old Frenchman. After an underwhelming rookie year, Salaun is playing fewer minutes this season, but he has been more efficient.\n\nMore: Hornets' Kon Knueppel ruled out against Magic with ankle injury\n\nThe 20-year-old is averaging 7.1 points on 51.1% from the field and 45.7% from three. Salaun has accepted his role, and he is doing his best to be as productive as possible. Coach Lee is pleased to see this because he sees solid potential with Salaun.\n\n\"He's totally embraced his role. He just realizes how much he can impact the game on both ends of the floor without just scoring, and that's what we're seeing. We're seeing more of a well-rounded game from him, where he's rebounding defensively and guarding multiple different guys,\" Lee said after winning on Friday.\n\n\"Offensively, that play where he had an opportunity to shoot an off-the-dribble step-back three, which he has in the past, and to make the one-more pass was very encouraging to see. It just shows how much he's about team, trying to compete, and do everything he can to impact winning.\"\n\nAgainst the Orlando Magic, Salaun had a superb game, posting 14 points on 6-7 shooting from the field while grabbing nine rebounds. It was an impressive performance that could lead to some consistency in the long run.\n\nAs long as Salaun is playing this way, one can expect that the Hornets will have a reliable wing moving forward. It will be a lengthy journey, but Salaun is only 20, so he has plenty of time to develop.\n\nHornets' LaMelo Ball held back after hard foul against Wizards\n\nCharlotte Hornets sign former Clemson star PJ Hall\n\nLuke Kornet found success by letting go: Inside Spurs big man's evolution away from 3-point specialist\n\nNBA trade rumors: Ranking 9 most likely stars to be traded, from Giannis Antetokounmpo to Anthony Davis\n\nAce Bailey injury update is bad news for Jazz rookie",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIndiana Hoosiers coach Curt Cignetti doesn't make the rules regarding the College Football Playoff. He just plays by them.\n\nThe Hoosiers earned the No. 1 seed in the 12-team field after beating the Ohio State Buckeyes in the Big Ten title game Dec. 6 in Indianapolis, which guaranteed the defending national champions wouldn't finish the season undefeated regardless of when it ends.\n\nGiven the Hoosiers' recent football history, a bye week is uncharted waters for Cignetti. But it's nothing his team can't handle, he told reporters Monday.\n\n“Would I prefer to play earlier? Yeah, I probably would, to be quite honest with you. But that’s not the case, so,\" Cignetti said. “We’re excited about playing. We’re off to a good start. And, it’ll be a tremendous challenge.”\n\nWith the Crimson Tide's road win against the Oklahoma Sooners this past Friday, Cignetti said Indiana didn't feel pressure to take its foot off the gas even though the result (an eventual 34-24 slugfest) was unknown.\n\n\"Well, you know, it is what it is, so you make the most of it,” Cignetti said. “The way we approached it until we knew the opponent? We treated it like two bye weeks, and now we have almost two weeks to prepare for the opponent.”\n\nThe game will likely come down to whoever is the most efficient quarterback between Fernando Mendoza and Ty Simpson, which should make for a potentially thrilling shootout in Pasadena, Calif.\n\nKickoff is set for 4 p.m. ET, as the winner extends the season.",

    "description": "Utah’s Morgan Scalley will make his head coaching debut in the Las Vegas Bowl. Here’s what he said after Kyle Whittingham left for Michigan.",
    "fullText": "After Kyle Whittingham stepped down as Utah’s coach two weeks ago, it was only a matter of time until Morgan Scalley’s first game as the Utes’ new head coach.\n\nScalley’s head coaching debut was supposed to be Sept. 3, 2026, when Utah opens next season at home against Idaho, but after Whittingham accepted the head coaching job at Michigan, that date has been moved up.\n\nScalley will be leading the Utes in the Las Vegas Bowl on New Year’s Eve when they take on Nebraska.\n\n“I’m fired up. I’m excited. I mean, there’s going to be learning on the go. At the same time, I have complete trust in our coaching staff and our players. They’re locked in. They’re dialed in,” Scalley said on Friday night in Las Vegas.\n\n“You see in that first team meeting guys that are intent on finishing this season off the right way. Eleven wins, we’ve only had that three times in University of Utah football history and we want to make that four.”\n\nPrior to news breaking Friday that Whittingham was taking the Michigan job, there were only three opt-outs among the two-deep on the Utes’ depth chart — offensive tackle Spencer Fano, offensive tackle Caleb Lomu and defensive end Logan Fano, all of whom have declared for the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nOn Friday, Scalley said he did not expect the roster for the Las Vegas Bowl to change.\n\n“No, and again, I think a lot of it has to do with the fact that the players have known that this has been coming,” Scalley said.\n\nWhile Utah senior offensive tackle Jaren Kump won’t be coached by Scalley next year, he is motivated to get Utah’s new leader his first win on New Year’s Eve.\n\n“I’m really happy for Coach Whitt, honestly, and I’m really happy for him to have this opportunity, but I’m also excited to be coached by Morgan Scalley and I’m going to tell our team ‘Let’s go get Coach Scalley’s first win on Wednesday,’” Kump said.\n\nIn the wake of Whittingham leaving for Michigan, Scalley expressed gratitude for the former Utah coach.\n\n“Well, you never want to be the guy that follows the guy and unfortunately that’s me, but he got me into the profession. He got me to switch from offense to defense as a player. I’ve been with him since 2001,” Scalley said.\n\n“So I’m just grateful for everything he’s done for me personally everything he’s done for the program, and the biggest thing that I’ve learned from him is it’s all about the players and in this profession, you can’t let your ego get in the way and he never did that and I’m so grateful for his legacy, what he’s taught me and for his mentorship along the way.”\n\nESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Whittingham informed Utah’s team in Las Vegas that he planned to take the Michigan job before flying to Orlando — where Michigan will play in the Citrus Bowl versus Texas — to meet with his new team.\n\n“What I do know is that I guess it was his initial intent to truly retire, but then he did express that if there were certain opportunities that came up, that he would think about those, and he expressed that one of those opportunities did come up,” Kump said.\n\n“But initially it was his intention to retire and to just be done with coaching, unless there was some opportunities that arose, and he expressed that one of those opportunities arose, so he put some thought into it and considered it with his family and did what is, I believe, a great decision for him.”\n\nScalley is at work trying assembling his staff while preparing his team for the bowl. Meanwhile, CBS Sports’ Matt Zenitz reported Friday that Utah offensive coordinator Jason Beck and BYU defensive coordinator Jay Hill are targets for Whittingham’s coaching staff at Michigan.\n\nHowever, Scalley says that everyone is focused on getting Utah that 11th win. Beck and the rest of Utah’s staff were on the team flight to Las Vegas.\n\n“A lot of it is understanding it’s all about the players,” Scalley said. “We’ve got an unbelievable staff that’s handled this thing the right way and their intent as well is to get that 11th win for our players, so it’s been a pretty seamless transition and because of how the administration and how coach Whittingham has handled the whole thing.”",

    "description": "A 2015 study showed that ten other men have a lot of descendants. The paper is just one of several genetic studies revealing the secrets of descent",
    "fullText": "Since a 2003 study found evidence that Genghis Khan’s DNA was present in about 16 million men alive at the time, the Mongolian ruler’s genetic prowess has stood as an unparalleled accomplishment. But he isn’t the only man whose reproductive activities still show a significant genetic impact centuries later. A 2015 study published in the European Journal of Human Genetics found that a handful of other men had prolific lineages, too.\n\nTo identify those lineages, the geneticists analyzed “the Y chromosomes of more than 5,000 men from 127 populations spanning Asia,” wrote Nature News’ Ewen Callaway in 2015. The Y chromosome is a part of the human genome handed down only from father to son. They found 11 Y-chromosome sequences that were each shared by more than 20 of the analyzed subjects. Chalk down one of those as Genghis Khan’s, and that leaves ten other men who initiated long-lived and widely spread family trees.\n\nWhen he ruled during the 13th century, Genghis Khan presided over land that spanned from the Pacific coast of China to the Caspian Sea. Historians don’t know exactly how many children Genghis Khan sired, but many agree his lineage is broad. In 1260, Persian historian ‘Ata-Malik Juvaini wrote: “Of the issue of the race and lineage of Chingiz [Genghis] Khan, there are now living in the comfort of wealth and affluence more than 20,000.”\n\nMongol rulers such as Genghis Khan could have spread their genes widely, because of rapes during conquests and because the khans had access to many women in the areas they ruled, Oxford University geneticist Chris Tyler-Smith told Nicholas Wade of the New York Times in 2003.\n\nGenghis Khan’s sons may have followed in their father’s footsteps and had large harems. Tushi, the emperor’s oldest son, had 40 sons himself, per the New York Times.\n\nSo, who were the other super-fertile fathers? One genetic sequence is attributed to Giocangga, the grandfather of the founder of the Qing dynasty. His Y chromosome was linked in a 2005 study to 1.5 million men in modern northern China. This large number likely resulted from his descendants taking many wives and concubines.\n\nThe other nine men are currently mysteries. Yet, by assuming they lived in the area where their genomes were most commonly found and by studying mutations in the genetic sequences, scientists suggest they originated throughout Asia between 2100 B.C.E. and 700 C.E., per Nature News.\n\nAccording to Nature News, the founders who lived at the earlier end of this range, between 2100 B.C.E and 300 B.C.E., were part of both agricultural and nomadic cultures. They lived during the emergence of hierarchical, authoritarian societies in Asia. And the three lineages connected to more recent times, including those linked to Genghis Khan and Giocangga, were associated with nomadic peoples in Mongolia and northeast China.\n\nLarge genetic legacies are not confined to that part of the globe. According to a 2006 study in the American Journal of Human Genetics, 1 in 12 Irishmen worldwide can trace their heritage back to a single individual. That man may be a fifth-century Irish warlord dubbed Niall of the Nine Hostages, who could have as many as three million direct male descendants in modern times.\n\nGenetic studies published in the last few years have continued to reveal more information about the heritage of peoples around the world. From uncovering the genetic history of the Viking age to confirming the origins of the Swahili people and pinpointing Neanderthal genes in modern populations, techniques analyzing ancient DNA have opened another window to understanding how genes flowed in the past.\n\nAs far as the nine unknown founders with impressive genetic lineages, more research is needed to discern their identities. But one thing is certain: Genghis Khan has never been the only big kid on the genetic block.",

    "description": "Brian Cox once toured as a keyboardist in major rock and pop bands. Now he’s a particle physicist on a new world tour with a dazzling show he designed in an era of science disinformation and denial.",
    "fullText": "Stefano Montali traveled to Redditch, England, in November to attend a warm-up show for Prof. Brian Cox’s coming world tour.\n\nProf. Brian Cox flashed a wide smile toward the crowd, picked up an iPad, looked up at the enormous screen behind him and started to write out a complex equation. “This is what I call a live math solo,” he said.\n\nThe audience chuckled. Many in the packed theater that night last month in the small English town of Redditch seemed to be in on the joke.\n\nBecause before he became Brian Cox, the particle physicist renowned for his adroitness in explaining the intricacies and magnificence of space, he was Brian Cox the rock star.\n\nHis first professional gig, in fact, was playing keyboards in the opening band on a tour with Jimmy Page, the lead guitarist of Led Zeppelin. His second band, D:Ream, had a song that hit No. 1 on the British pop charts in 1994.\n\nNow, Professor Cox is the star of his own show, albeit one about science.\n\nHe has sold out venues often reserved for sports and pop stars, like Wembley Arena (not the stadium) and the O2 in London. His coming tour, “Emergence,” will take him to places like Singapore, Serbia and Australia, before arriving in the United States in late 2026.\n\n“If you believe, as I do, that science is one of the necessary foundations of society, alongside the arts and politics,” Professor Cox said in an interview, “it has to be there with them on an equal footing.”\n\nWith his geniality, Beatles-esque haircut and a dazzling show that explores black holes, galaxies and the significance — and insignificance — of human beings in the universe, Professor Cox, 57, has reached mainstream audiences, when many scientists cannot.\n\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and popular science communicator, said in an interview that Professor Cox, whom he has known for years, “has a force of rationality, and a force of reason, and a force of science.” He added, “Society needs all three, lest we regress back to the caves whence we came.”\n\nIn an era when science denial and disinformation are common, Professor Cox, who teaches particle physics at the University of Manchester, has sought to make science accessible through Peabody Award-winning BBC documentaries and podcasts, books and appearances on other media, like “The Joe Rogan Experience.”\n\nThis year, the United Nations named Professor Cox its Champion for Space, a role in which he will work with the organization to promote space as a “force for progress.”\n\nAs a child, Professor Cox spent many Saturday mornings at the Manchester Airport, near his hometown, Oldham, England, spotting planes with his father. “I liked the engineering, the big machines,” he said. “The Apollo moon landings, astronomy, science fiction — I wanted to see ‘Star Wars,’ ‘Star Trek,’ ‘Alien,’ all of it.”\n\nEventually, Professor Cox’s interests expanded to include music.\n\nAt 18, he deferred going to university for a year to join the band Dare, founded by a member of Thin Lizzy who lived nearby. The band recorded its debut album with A&M Records in Joni Mitchell’s private studio.\n\nAfter one London show where Dare opened for Jimmy Page, Professor Cox said he found himself having a drink backstage with George Harrison.\n\nEven while touring, Professor Cox read popular science books.\n\nHe left Dare at 23 — after a bar fight with his bandmates in Berlin, he said — to study physics and astronomy at the University of Manchester. He soon joined D:Ream, whose No. 1 pop anthem “Things Can Only Get Better” was later appropriated by the Labour Party.\n\nEventually, he left that band to shift his focus to science. Stints at particle accelerators in Hamburg, Chicago and Geneva followed.\n\nIn 2001, Professor Cox met Gia Milinovich, a TV presenter and writer, whom he married two years later at her mother’s house in Duluth, Minn. The pair started writing documentary ideas “with the sole aim of ‘making science part of popular culture,’” she told The Guardian in 2010. Today, they live in London with their 16-year-old son, George.\n\nStill, the draw to the stage never truly left Professor Cox, who eventually found his way back to it.\n\nThe show in Redditch, about 45 minutes south of Birmingham, was the beginning of a slate of warm-up performances. For Professor Cox, they are a chance to work out new material. The show changes night to night.\n\nProfessor Cox’s enthusiasm is as much a character in the show as the planets and the stars. He kept the audience captivated, even on topics that might seem out of reach, like the origin of space and time or quantum entanglement.\n\nDavid Attenborough, whose nature documentaries on the BBC helped carve out a place for science presenters on television, said in 2013, “If I had a torch, I would hand it to Brian Cox.”\n\nBut the worlds in which Mr. Attenborough first rose to fame and in which Professor Cox works now couldn’t be more different. Disinformation on social media has contributed to a growing skepticism of experts.\n\n“Our instinct, which is a good instinct,” Professor Cox said, “is to say, ‘I want to listen to as many voices as possible.’” Still, he stressed that there needed to be a weighting to people who have expertise.\n\nBut his expertise has been poached by hyper-realistic deepfakes. Days before the Redditch show, several appeared online depicting him falsely claiming that the 3I/ATLAS comet, which was passing through the solar system, was an alien spacecraft.\n\nThe mother of a friend of his was so convinced by the deepfake that she was “starting to hoard things,” Professor Cox said the friend told him.\n\nWith the deepfakes multiplying and looking increasingly realistic, the effort to take them down can feel like full-time job, he said.\n\nEarlier in his career, Professor Cox made light of conspiracies.\n\nWhile he was working in Geneva at CERN on the Large Hadron Collider, or LHC, several doomsday theories circulated online claiming the accelerator could cause the end of the universe by creating microscopic black holes.\n\n“My first instinct was to laugh it off,” Professor Cox said. He told the The Daily Telegraph that “anyone who thinks the LHC will destroy the world” is a fool, though he used a word that many find offensive.\n\nIt caused an uproar. “It’s probably my most famous quote,” Professor Cox said.\n\nBut he says he came to understand of conspiracy theories that it’s important to be sensitive that even if people believe in something that isn’t true, the strong emotion that belief can evoke — panic or fear, in the case of the collider — is real.\n\n“If people are getting information that’s saying that there’s a chance that the world will be destroyed,” he said, “it’s not silly to be worried about that.”\n\nHe has appeared three times in the past decade on Joe Rogan’s podcast. While he acknowledges that Mr. Rogan and his guests have indulged in conspiracy theories or denial about climate change and other accepted science, Professor Cox regards the appearances as an opportunity to reach an important new audience.\n\nAt the start of his show in Redditch, Professor Cox appeared in front of a projection of the Charles Bridge in Prague on a snowy night, and he told the story of how the astronomer Johannes Kepler pondered the physical makeup of a six-pointed snowflake. Eventually, the visual zoomed deeper and deeper into one of the falling snowflakes, revealing its intricacy.\n\nAs he stood to the side of the stage in the dark, Professor Cox described how Kepler’s bridge walk, along with Galileo’s discovery of Jupiter’s four largest moons, contributed to a revolution in science — a refocusing away from the reliance on ancient knowledge and toward the modern method of observation and questioning.\n\nThat drive for discovery, Professor Cox said, lies at the center of his show and at the heart of his questions. How do we acquire reliable knowledge? How do we remove our opinion and biases?\n\n“Certainty is kind of a brutish thing,” he said, “it doesn’t really get you anywhere.”\n\nAs for the music world, Professor Cox still has a toe in. He reunited with D:Ream, onstage at the Glastonbury Festival in 2024. And at another event, he said, he was approached by a fan who expressed his awe at a show Professor Cox had done about Enceladus, one of Saturn’s moons.",

    "title": "The Economy Avoided a Recession in 2025",
    "description": "A feared recession didn’t materialize, but unemployment rose, wage growth slowed and affordability challenges are mounting.",
    "fullText": "After a chaotic year filled with trade wars, market gyrations and the longest government shutdown in history, the U.S. economy has, once again, proved more resilient than many forecasters feared.\n\nBut “resilient” isn’t quite the same thing as “good.”\n\nMany Americans are entering 2026 worried about their jobs, stressed about their finances and unconvinced that things will improve in the new year.\n\nThe flow of official economic data resumed last week after a prolonged delay caused by the government shutdown. The reports were muddled by technical quirks related to the shutdown, but on balance they suggested the economy remained stuck in the same uneasy limbo it was in before the data blackout began.\n\nJob growth was decent in November, but unemployment rose. Retail sales were solid, but wage growth slowed. Inflation cooled, but remains elevated.\n\nThat mixed picture is far better than the dire forecasts of last spring, when many economists warned that President Trump’s tariffs would lead to runaway inflation, a recession — or both.\n\nInstead, data this week is expected to show that gross domestic product, which measures overall economic output, grew at a robust pace in the third quarter. Full-year data, when it becomes available early next year, is likely to show that output, adjusted for inflation, grew at about a 1.5 percent pace in 2025, a downshift from 2024 but far from a recession.\n\nA gradual deterioration, though, is still a deterioration. In surveys, Americans overwhelmingly say they are struggling with the cost of living and do not believe the economy is working for them — an impression borne out by data showing that consumer spending is being driven by a relative handful of rich households.\n\nMr. Trump tried to shift that narrative in a combative — and often misleading — prime-time speech last week in which he blamed his predecessor for economic problems and promised that a “Golden Age” was just around the corner.\n\nMany forecasters do expect a rosier backdrop next year. But the problem for Mr. Trump is that few of the larger economic problems that pushed voters away from the incumbent party in 2024 have improved, and some have gotten worse.\n\nTariffs haven’t caused a spike in inflation, but they have pushed up prices for some consumer products. Homeownership remains out of reach for many Americans. Child care is still broadly unaffordable, electricity bills are rising and health care premiums are set to rise for millions of families when insurance subsidies expire at the end of the year.\n\n“When individual Americans think about the economy, they are thinking about: ‘Can I afford the things I need and want? Do I have economic opportunities?’” said Heather Boushey, who served as an economic adviser to President Joseph R. Biden Jr.\n\nWhen the answer to those questions is “no,” she said, it is hard to convince people that the economy is strong — a lesson she and her Biden administration colleagues learned the hard way.\n\n“You can’t tell people what their reality is,” Ms. Boushey said.\n\nDespite Mr. Trump’s claim that he “inherited a mess,” the economy when he returned to office was strong by most measures. Unemployment was low. Wages were rising. Inflation, though higher than normal, had fallen significantly from its peak in 2022.\n\nThe frenetic early months of the Trump administration threatened to derail that progress. The president’s on-again, off-again tariff threats, combined with Elon Musk’s efforts to eliminate programs and cut the federal work force, led to steep drops in consumer confidence and wild swings in the stock market.\n\nThen on April 2, Mr. Trump announced tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners. Markets plunged, and economists warned of a recession or “stagflation,” the dreaded combination of high inflation and weak growth last seen in the United States in the 1970s.\n\nThe worst predictions never came to pass, partly because Mr. Trump reversed course, rolling back some tariffs and delaying others. That gave companies an opportunity to build up inventories and re-engineer supply chains. Companies also proved more reluctant to pass price increases on to consumers than many economists initially expected, perhaps because they doubted that customers would be willing or able to stomach the extra cost.\n\nThe U.S. economy also turned out to have unexpected sources of strength that helped offset the drag from the trade war. A surge in construction of data centers for artificial intelligence models helped prop up business investment, while a rising stock market — also tied primarily to optimism around A.I. — encouraged consumer spending.\n\n“If it weren’t for the A.I. spending boom, we would be in a different place,” said Michael Strain, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank.\n\nBut the benefits have not been evenly distributed. Wealthy households have reaped most of the stock market gains, even as the softening labor market has led to slower wage growth, particularly for the lowest earners. As a result, consumer spending has become bifurcated, with high-income households spending and lower-income households increasingly falling behind on financial obligations. Car repossessions and other signs of financial stress have picked up this year.\n\n“Yes, there are people who are doing great, but I don’t think there’s this sense that the tide is really coming in and lifting all the boats,” said Michael Madowitz, an economist at the Roosevelt Institute, a liberal think tank.\n\nFor some groups, the cooling labor market has turned downright icy. Recent college graduates are having the hardest time finding jobs since the aftermath of the Great Recession more than a decade ago. The unemployment rate for Black workers jumped to 8.3 percent in November, up from 6.1 percent at the end of last year and double the rate for white workers.\n\n“That’s a level that would be considered an economic crisis if they were happening to Americans overall,” said Jessica Fulton, a senior fellow at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a think tank focused on issues affecting Black Americans.\n\nCuts to the federal government have hit Black workers disproportionately, Ms. Fulton noted. But she warned that the problems affecting Black families today — a weakening labor market, cuts to federal safety net programs, rising electricity prices that are partly a result of the rapid growth of A.I. data centers — may soon be felt more widely.\n\n“People are being squeezed from all sides,” Ms. Fulton said. “We’re seeing that from Black workers now, which I think could foreshadow the same thing for everyone else.”\n\nDespite such concerns, many forecasters expect growth to pick back up next year, and for the labor market to improve rather than deteriorate further.\n\nThey point to several potential sources of strength. The tax cuts that Congress passed this year should lead to larger refunds for many Americans, which should provide a lift to consumers early in the year. The law also included provisions to encourage companies to invest.\n\nLower interest rates — the result of a series of cuts the Federal Reserve made this fall — should also help businesses and consumers. Policymakers are weighing whether to deliver more reductions in the coming year.\n\nBut perhaps the biggest lift could come from reduced uncertainty after a uniquely tumultuous year in which businesses and investors contended with seismic changes related to tariffs, immigration restrictions and government regulation.\n\n“2025 was hampered by all the policy-related uncertainty,” said Stephen Stanley, chief U.S. economist at Santander, a bank. “The policy landscape is going to allow businesses to re-engage, and when they do that, I think you’ll see a pickup in investment.”\n\nPolicymakers are similarly optimistic. John Williams, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in an interview with CNBC on Friday that he was “feeling actually pretty good” about the economy.\n\n“We got through 2025,” he said. “This has been an uncertain year. A lot has happened, and the economy has come through this.”\n\nBut that rosy outlook could be upended if the A.I. boom fades and takes the stock market along with it, or if the calmer year many hope for from Mr. Trump does not come to fruition, either because of new tariffs or other policy changes.\n\nEven without a new shock to the system, there is a risk that the steady deterioration could continue. Veronica Clark, an economist at Citigroup, forecasts that sluggish monthly jobs growth and more muted wage gains will finally start to weigh on consumer spending next year. Higher unemployment will offset the benefits of larger tax refunds and other tailwinds, she predicts.\n\n“If the labor market is really weakening, then those other things almost don’t matter,” Ms. Clark said.",

    "description": "The compiler is a powerful tool, yet many developers have a painful relationship with it. Can we do better?",
    "fullText": "Note: this is a \"script\" for a podcast that I recently recorded, as such it's more conversational and less technical than the usual content of this blog. Not a single code block in sight...\n\nImagine you wake up one night to find out that production is crashing. It takes you a while to unearth the root cause. It turns out to be a null pointer exception deep inside a service. It crashed the whole system. How did it get there? Where did it come from?\n\nNow imagine a different story. One day a developer had to struggle for a whole of 20 minutes fixing some informative compilation errors. And that's it, that's the whole story. Nobody had to wake up at night, production never crashed.\n\nOne of these stories is a story of lies and deceit, the other a story of dialogue and cooperation. Today we will learn how to stop lying to the compiler, and how to get a good night's sleep.\n\n(If you're familiar at high-level with how compilers work, feel free to skip to the next part)\n\nBut first things first. What is a compiler?\n\nIn the broadest sense, a compiler is a function, that takes an input in one format and produces an output in another format. This definition is so broad as to be useless... Although, if you take this definition seriously, it has some interesting implications on how we approach solving problems in everyday code. But I digress.\n\nLet's try again, more concretely this time. A typical compiler takes source code in some programming language and produces an output in some other language. For example, a C compiler takes files written in C, and produces assembly code.\n\nA typical compiler pipeline might have the following steps:\n\nAs we will soon see, the typechecking step is probably the most relevant for most developers.\n\nLike most things, nothing is that simple. Different languages have differently flavored compilers, doing a wide range of things. This is not a thorough review on all things compilers, so instead, let's take a sample of languages and see what kind of compilers they have.\n\nRust is similar to C, in that it compiles directly to machine code. To distinguish this \"classic\" compiler from the rest, we call this style an \"ahead of time\" compiler. This means that everything that the compiler does starts and ends before runtime. Once we created the binary output, the work of the compiler is done.\n\nBut, this doesn't mean that the job of the compiler is easy. Rust is quite sophisticated, apart from parsing the source code the compiler needs to do things like macro expansion, type checking, borrow checking, and lots, and lots of optimizations.\n\nOptimization, and generally performance is a common benefit of using compiled languages. Compiled languages tend to be faster than languages that don't use a classic compiler, but are instead dynamically interpreted on the fly (like Python). And Rust is famous for its optimizations in the style of \"zero cost abstractions\".\n\nZero cost abstraction means that despite Rust being a low-level language, in many cases one can write pretty high-level code and still get the performance of handwritten low-level code. This is possible because the compiler analyzes the code, and manages to translate a high-level construct like map on an iterator into a low-level, fast loop. This includes optimizations like inlining and loop fusion.\n\nAs a developer writing in Rust though, the thing that you would notice the most during development is all the memory safety checks the compiler does for you at every step.\n\nRust makes it possible to safely manage memory without using a garbage collector, probably one of the biggest pain points of using low-level languages like C and C++. It boils down to the fact that many of the common memory issues that we can experience, things like dangling pointers, double freeing memory, and data races, all stem from the same thing: uncontrolled sharing of mutable state. For example, if two different variables share a pointer to the same data, if one of them frees the pointer, the other will end up with an invalid pointer without knowing it. Likely breaking something upon pointer dereference.\n\nSo Rust forbids us from freely sharing pointers. Each pointer has exactly one owner at every moment of time. Once the owner goes out of scope, memory is freed automatically. Since there are no other owners, this is safe and cannot lead to dangling pointers and the like.\n\nWhat makes Rust special is that all of this happens at compile-time. The compiler tracks pointer ownership, using something called a borrow checker, forbidding us from doing anything that violates the single ownership of pointers. Memory unsafe code will simply fail to compile.\n\nRust's powerful type system is one very compelling (and painful) reason to use it. A broken elevator and walking 21 floors up the stairs can really motivate you to invent such a safe language.\n\nPeople often think of Java as a static, compiled language. But actually, the Java compiler doesn't produce machine code. Instead, it produces bytecode. An intermediate (stack-based) language that is then dynamically interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) when the bytecode is executed.\n\nThe reason for going through all this trouble is portability. By using intermediate bytecode, Java can be compiled once on any platform, but then executed on any other platform that has an implementation of the JVM. That's cool and all, but didn't we just say that interpreted languages are slow?\n\nTrue, in the early days of Java, people were worried that running such a \"dynamic\" language will be too slow to be useful, and surely will never be able to compete with something like C++. And that's why we have \"just in time\" compilation. Or JIT for short.\n\nThe Java compiler does a lot less than Rust's. The translation from Java to bytecode is comparatively simple. The compiler doesn't make optimizations as far reaching as the Rust compiler. And if we left things that way Java would indeed be quite slow.\n\nThe real fun begins at runtime. The Java runtime has a JIT compiler enabled. The JIT compiler monitors the execution of the bytecode, as it gets slowly interpreted step by step. After a while, the JIT starts recognizing various hotspots in the code, like long loops, or common branching points. It then takes the bytecode for the hotspot and compiles it down to an efficient machine code representation. From that point onwards, that segment of code should run much more quickly.\n\nLike a sophisticated ahead of time (AOT) compiler, the JIT compiler can apply nontrivial optimizations to the code. But unlike an AOT compiler, the JIT compiler has access to the actual usage patterns at runtime. Meaning that it can be more aggressive in optimizing the real bottlenecks in code. Things like dynamic dispatch in an object-oriented class hierarchy can be converted to static dispatch at runtime.\n\nIf you ever wondered why your JVM app takes time to \"warm up\" before it's actually fast, the JIT compiler is your answer. It takes time for the JIT compiler to recognize and compile the actual hotspots in code.\n\nThese days, Java has an AOT compiler as well, called Graal. As a result we can use the very same Java code and produce two completely different artifacts, either in bytecode or machine code (with some limitations).\n\nMore generally compilers can have more than one compilation target, or \"backends\". For example, both Scala and Kotlin can be compiled to either JVM bytecode, JavaScript, and native machine code. To support such use cases, and to avoid repetition between different backends, the compiler will have some intermediate representation of the language that is being compiled, the AST. This way, most of the compiler's work like parsing, typechecking, and various optimizations can produce one AST, but then that one AST can be converted into different outputs.\n\nDespite all that complex work being done by the various compilers, most of the interaction that Java programmers have with the compiler is with the type checker. Java's type-system is not nearly as strict as Rust's, often being more annoying than helpful. So it's not uncommon for us the developers to \"know better\" than the compiler and use a cast every now and then. These are the first signs of trouble...\n\nSeeing that a compiler can be quite the complex beast, you would be quite correct in asking:\n\nOr more specifically, in what language is the compiler written? It would seem natural for the developers of a new language X to write the compiler in X. Surely it's their favorite language. At the very least, it's a good idea for them to dogfood their own creation.\n\nAmong people who write compilers, writing the compiler in the very same language it's supposed to compile is considered an important milestone. It shows that the language is mature enough to be able to implement such a complex piece of code. When a language does it, it is said to be \"self-hosting\".\n\nHere we have a paradox. If I have a compiler written in X, to be able to use it I first need to compile it, and for that I need a compiler for language X. But I don't have one compiled, I need to compile it first... And so we find ourselves with a chicken and egg problem.\n\nThe way to get out of this conundrum is by a procedure called \"bootstrapping\". Here things are going to get a bit meta.\n\nIt goes like this. First write a compiler in language X, the \"bootstrapped compiler\". Ideally you do that using as few features of X as possible. Then choose another existing language Y (can be assembly or some high-level language), and write a compiler for X in Y, the \"bootstrapping compiler\". It doesn't have to handle all of the features of X, only the ones that were used in the code for the bootstrapped compiler. Once you run the bootstrapping compiler on the code for the bootstrapped compiler, congratulations, you now have a brand new self-hosting compiler for X. From this point onwards, you can improve the compiler and add features to it all without leaving the comfort of your favorite language X.\n\nWe can follow this process with the Rust compiler. Originally, it was written in the OCaml language. But the current Rust compiler was rewritten in Rust, which makes it a proper self-hosting compiler.\n\nThis is all good and well, but most of the time us simple developers don't really care about the language the compiler uses, we just need it to compile code. The reason I'm telling you all this is that it gives us an interesting insight into the development of programming languages.\n\nThe people who write compilers are usually the same people that design the language itself. And most of what they do all day long is writing compiler code. This might skew their incentives. They really enjoy using languages that are a good fit for writing compilers. Even more so, since in the early stages of a new language the compiler is probably the biggest piece of code written in it. That's the chance for the new language to really shine.\n\nWe shouldn't be surprised then, to find that many new languages tend to accumulate features that are very convenient for compiler writers. Things like pattern matching, and implicit parameters.\n\nBut seeing how compilers are not very representative of the code most of us write daily, this might not be the best way to spend the complexity budget when designing a new language. Lucky for us, some of those features are useful for plain-old, boring business code as well. Especially code written in the functional style.\n\nLet's wrap up this exploration of compilers with one more language.\n\nThe TypeScript compiler is special in that the target is not a low-level format like assembly and bytecode, but instead another high-level language, JavaScript. Although definitions are a bit fluid, but in this case we say that the TypeScript compiler is actually a \"transpiler\". Even more curiously, since JavaScript is a strict subset of TypeScript, we can say that TypeScript is compiling into itself.\n\nThere are two main reasons to want to do that: nicer syntax for various features of JavaScript (like classes and enums), and the type-system that TypeScript adds on top of JavaScript.\n\nMicrosoft, who developed TypeScript, was motivated by the pain they experienced when scaling large JavaScript codebases. Adding a robust type-system to a language makes it much easier to tame large codebases over time (things like refactoring become safer). We can see the same trend with Dropbox investing in Mypy, an optional type checker for Python, to help scaling their Python codebase.\n\nAdding a type-system to an existing programming language is very different from designing a language with types from the ground up. With an existing language you must be able to add types to as much existing code as possible. And codebases in dynamic language sure do tend to be... Dynamic.\n\nTo mitigate this, TypeScript uses gradual typing. With gradual typing you don't have to add types to the whole codebase all at once, like you would in, say, Java. Instead, you can do it gradually, and the compiler verifies that whatever is annotated is consistent with itself, and ignores the rest. This smoothes migration from an untyped code and mindset to a typed one.\n\nThere is also the question of which type system is most appropriate for an ex-dynamic language. Did you know that type-systems come in different flavors? Most mainstream languages use \"nominal\" type-systems. This means that each type gets a unique name, and types that have different names are treated as distinct types by the compiler. In contrast, TypeScript uses a \"structural\" type-system. Two types are considered the same if they have the same structure, e.g., the same fields and methods. The name of the type doesn't matter.\n\nStructural typing seems to be better suited when gradually typing a dynamic language. \"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck\" is a common viewpoint in dynamic languages, and structural typing is the way to capture this mindset with types.\n\nIn a curious turn of events, TypeScript and Mypy went the other way around with bootstrapping and self-hosting. The current TypeScript compiler is self-hosting, but a rewrite in Go is in the works. In Mypy, the compiler was rewritten from plain Python into a special almost-Python dialect that compiles directly to C. The motivation for both rewrites is performance. Turns out that it's difficult to get a sufficiently fast compiler that can quickly process large codebases in dynamic runtimes like JavaScript and Python.\n\nLike before, we can't help but notice that the type-system is the main interface between the developer and the compiler. In the case of TypeScript I would say that it's also the main reason to even want to use the language.\n\nAnd yet, so many developers hate the compiler. It seems that all it does is yell at us about trivialities like \"string is not int\" and such. Is it worth bothering with a compiled language just for that?\n\nThe compiler is always angry. It's always yelling at us for no good reason. It's only happy when we surrender to it and do what it tells us to do. Why do we agree to such an abusive relationship?\n\nAnd for someone who yells that much, it's not even that smart. Remember all the times when the compiler yelled at you something about a type mismatch, but turns out that you were right and the compiler was wrong? In the end you had to use a cast (or mark something as any) just to shut the compiler up.\n\nWe can solve these issues by quitting the relationship, and jumping ship to a dynamic language. I suspect that compiler abuse is why in the past Python grew in popularity compared to Java (that, and Java's verbosity). But we just saw that even in historically dynamic languages, like JavaScript and Python, there's a trend towards a more static, more compiler-centric way of writing code. These days Python has not just one, but multiple competing tools for typechecking (mypy, pyright, pyrefly, ty). Why do people lean that way?\n\nMaybe it's performance. We talked before about how compiled languages tend to be faster than dynamic languages. But that doesn't seem quite right. In many contexts, where the language's performance is not the bottleneck, people will still use types. And TypeScript, for example, doesn't give us a runtime performance benefit, all the type information is discarded after compilation. Are people really just that masochistic?\n\nMaybe Rust is the answer. Rust's compiler brings significant improvements in code safety where memory management is involved. True, its compiler is even more difficult to satisfy than average, but it solves a very tangible problem that would be very difficult to safely solve otherwise. Still, most of us don't write low-level code, and we mostly use garbage-collected, memory-safe languages. Not many mainstream languages have a type-system that is as powerful as Rust's, so we don't usually get that much extra safety.\n\nWe can imagine that in very large codebases, like the ones managed by Microsoft and Dropbox, there's some magical advantage to having types checked by the compiler (we mentioned safer refactoring before), despite the obvious pains. But most of us don't maintain code that large, why bother with types then?\n\nIt seems that all the compiler can do for us is act as simple, and not very reliable, guard rails. Sure it would sometimes notice that this or that int is actually a string. But if that's all it can do for us, then we might as well write a couple of unit tests, and remove this nuisance from our lives.\n\nI think that this is a false premise. The compiler is actually much more useful and powerful than it might appear. So useful in fact, that relying on it is beneficial in any codebase, large and small. The problem is that we are used to lie to the compiler all the time, in return all it can do for us is yell about strings not being ints and do little else.\n\nWhat do I mean by lying to the compiler?\n\nThe compiler, or rather the type-system, is only aware of things that are known at compile-time. A \"lie\" would be to write code that communicates one thing at compile-time while doing something else at runtime. On the other hand, the more facts that we can truthfully state to the compiler at compile-time, the more useful the compiler can be. But first, let's see some concrete examples of lies.\n\nWhen we say that some variable x is a string. What do we mean by that? It means that the runtime values that x can take are things \"a\", \"ab\", \"abc\", and many other reasonable strings. This also means that we can apply various methods to x like substring or endsWith. Unfortunately, in most modern languages this also means that at runtime it can be null.\n\nUnlike the other non-null values, you cannot call substring or any other method on null. Calling a method on null will trigger an NullPointerException, possibly far away in code and time from where that null was created. We could adopt a policy of \"defensive programming\" checking for null every step of the way. But in practice nobody does that. Instead, in many places in our code we implicitly assume that values are non-null unless stated otherwise (in a comment that nobody actually reads).\n\nThis is one of the most common lies we tell the compiler. We state that something is a valid string, but at runtime it can just as well be null. In most mainstream languages the compiler cannot distinguish between nullable and non-nullable values. And so it cannot help us out when our nullability assumptions turn out to be wrong. That's when things crash.\n\nHow many times did you find yourself setting something to null because you couldn't come up with something better, only to discover that some other place starts crashing?\n\nSpeaking of crashing, another source of lies we tell the compiler are exceptions. More specifically, unchecked exceptions.\n\nIf we write that some method returns string, what do we mean by this? Ideally, we mean that every time we call the method a string value will be returned. But in reality, there's another, sneaky way of returning from a method: we can throw an exception.\n\nSimilar to null, unchecked exceptions might be discovered away from the origin (although not as bad as null, they have to walk up the stack, and are not stored as data). And similar to null the compiler won't track them for us. If we don't go into a full defensive mode, we're assuming that the code is exception-free, and assumptions tend to break over time. But we lied to the compiler, so it won't be there to help when they finally break.\n\nHow many times did you leave a comment on some branch of code stating \"this CANNOT happen\" and thrown an exception? Did you ever find yourself surprised when eventually it did happen? I know I did, since then I at least add some logs even if I think I'm sure that it really cannot happen.\n\nSo far things happened by accident, due to implicit assumptions being broken. But sometimes we are smarter than the compiler. Sometimes we know better and we can force the compiler to obey. We can use type casting.\n\nSuppose that there's some interface, let's call it Animal. And it has two different implementations: Cat and Dog. Sorry for the cliche example, it's difficult to be original without written code.\n\nNow we are working on some code that got an Animal argument, call it x. In this particular flow we know for certain that x must be a Dog. We can follow the code ourselves and show that x is unquestionably a Dog. So we want to use Dog-specific methods. But the silly compiler won't let us. It only knows about Animal methods.\n\nThe compiler won't budge, and we won't budge. So we take out our hammer, and use a cast. Now x is a Dog, and the compiler doesn't argue anymore. All is well, until some new feature request that requires supporting Cats in our flow. When we make the change, we forget about that cast we did a while ago to make things work, and the code explodes.\n\nThe compiler didn't help us because we silenced it by lying to it. There are two lies going on here, why wasn't the initial type precise enough? If we can see that it must be Dog, why weren't we able to show that to the compiler? Then there's the cast itself, which blatantly tells one thing to the compiler (x is a Dog), when the reality might be something else (x is a Cat).\n\nHow often do you think you know better than the compiler?\n\nUp until now the examples are quite obvious lies. We all feel a bit dirty when doing a cast, or throwing a runtime exception with the comment \"this should NEVER happen\". But here's a more subtle example.\n\nLet's say there's a function called foo. When we see that foo takes no arguments and returns void, what can we say about what foo does without looking at its implementation? Nothing really. It's clearly doing something, and that something is not reflected in its inputs or outputs. We can only conclude that the function is doing some kind of side-effect, like changing a variable or writing to a file.\n\nJust like us, the compiler doesn't know anything useful about foo either. So we have a function that is clearly doing something important, otherwise it won't be there. But all we tell the compiler is that \"nope, move along, nothing interesting to see here\". But that's a blatant lie, something interesting is going on here, but the type of foo doesn't reflect that.\n\nThe compiler gets so confused that even if we comment out a call to foo it won't complain, it's as if it doesn't even know it exists.\n\nIf you look at a typical codebase, many, many functions return void. Every time we do that we prevent the compiler from knowing something useful about the flow of the code.\n\nWith all these lies all over the place, it's no wonder that the compiler is not particularly useful. What happens if we stop lying to it?\n\nIf we want develop a serious, constructive relationship with the compiler, we must first stop lying to it. Only then can we open channels for serious dialogue.\n\nWe are so used to using null, exceptions, casting, and side-effects, that at first sight it might seem impossible to give those up.\n\nSome languages like Rust and Haskell have no null at all. Can you imagine what it's like to work that way?\n\nLiberating, that's how it feels. You no longer have to keep worrying about an accidental null slipping through, because there aren't any. But, you might ask, what if something really is missing, how do I represent that without null?\n\nIn a world without null there are a number of ways to represent a thing that might be missing. The most common one is to use something like an Option type, that can be in one of two states, present with a value, or missing. When you want say that a String might not exist you use the type \"option-of-String\". And that makes all the difference to the compiler.\n\nNow the compiler knows what's going on, since option-of-String is a distinct type from just String, it's no longer possible to call String methods, like substring, on it. Every time you deal with an option-of-String value the compiler will helpfully remind you to deal with the possibility that the value is missing.\n\nOn the flip side of that, now every time you have a String value you no longer have to worry that it might be missing. You can just use it without any defensive programming involved. And if you mistakenly break the rules and try to assign an option value to a non-option value the compiler will point that out and force you to think whether that's what you really want and what the consequences across the codebase will be.\n\nSome languages, like Typescript and Kotlin have builtin support for nullable values. If you mark a String as nullable, it will become a distinct type from a plain String, giving us similar benefits to Option. In Java we can emulate something similar with Nullable and Nonnull annotation. But that requires some additional tooling to make it work.\n\nWhat all those approaches have in common is that all of them involve the compiler. Instead of hiding our assumptions from the compiler we make them explicit in a way that the type-system can track.\n\nWe can do the same with exceptions.\n\nI'm personally not aware of languages that completely remove exceptions from the language. But working mostly without exceptions, at least as a convention, is definitely possible.\n\nInspired by the null case, we can take a similar approach with exceptions and make them explicit in our types.\n\nThe most common way to do that is to use another container type like Result or Try. A return type like \"result-of-String\" means that we can have one of two cases, either a success with a String value, or a failure with some exception.\n\nThis approach makes it explicit to both us and the compiler what's going in a function. Now the compiler can track possible errors for us, and force us to deal with them as appropriate. And if we change some piece of code from String to \"result-of-String\", the compiler will helpfully shows where this needs to be handled.\n\nIn Java we can take an alternative approach and use checked exceptions. But industry experience over the years seems to indicate that people don't enjoy using them. It's probably a matter of ergonomics. Using a wrapper type instead might be a more ergonomic alternative.\n\nWhile avoiding nulls and exceptions is fairly straightforward, casts can be trickier.\n\nUnless forced to by some external library, I think that the presence of casts in our code should be considered a design smell. My first (possibly controversial) suggestion would be to configure your tooling to just forbid them by default.\n\nWhen feeling the need to use a cast, we should consider whether the current design is doing a good job of reflecting our intentions. Recall that when doing a cast we can ask one of two questions, why was the type not precise enough to begin with? And why do we need to cast here?\n\nThere's no generic answer to these questions, but finding a good answer to either of them will make the compiler's life easier.\n\nSome times the solution would be to add more methods on a parent interface (like Animal). Some times you might discover that you could've started out with the more specific type (Dog, for example) from the very beginning.\n\nAnother class of solutions is to remodel the problem from using open interfaces to using sealed/union types. Many modern languages support them. Using sealed types retains some of the flexibility of using open interfaces, but still allows the compiler to be in the loop. Instead of blindly assuming that some case is true, we can safely match on the sealed type and the compiler will gladly inform us about all the cases we must handle at this point. Some languages can even magically auto-complete all the relevant cases.\n\nAs code evolves, the compiler will keep track of the cases over time. And if something changed in the sealed type, the compiler will tell us about all the locations where the new case should be handled. Giving us a chance to handle whatever new logic that was added, before it crashes at runtime. Something that it was powerless to do when you used a plain cast.\n\nNow for the thorniest issue of them all.\n\nSoftware exists to make side-effects, otherwise we would just have overheating boxes without any useful output. So side-effects cannot be completely eliminated from code. But they can be better managed.\n\nThis is even a deeper design issue than casting, and there isn't a one size fits all solution. My suggestion would be to separate as much pure computation from side-effects as possible.\n\nIn practical terms that would mean that every time you see a void return, or something that performs some side-effects mixed with other useful computation, you try to extract a pure function, with well-defined inputs and outputs, that only does computation, and another function that does the side-effects (similar to the Command Query Separation principle).\n\nA common pattern would be to separate pure business logic from data fetching/writing. So instead of intertwining database calls with computation, you split into three separate phases: fetch, compute, store (a tiny ETL). First fetch all the data you need from a database, then you pass it to a (pure) function that produces some output, then pass the output of the pure function to a store procedure.\n\nNow instead of having one big flow that takes no inputs and produces no outputs, you have three building blocks, and one of them has well-defined inputs and outputs. Not only is having this separation makes it easier to focus on your business logic, especially when writing tests. But now that we have inputs and outputs the compiler can follow along as well and help out.\n\nTaking these ideas seriously leads us toward architectures that are known as \"functional core, imperative shell\". Within the functional core the compiler is much more useful, because it has actual types for inputs and outputs that it can follow and enforce. More \"interesting stuff\" is happening within the knowledge of the compiler.\n\nLet's see what happens when we maximize that knowledge.\n\nOkay, so we stopped lying to the compiler as much as we can, and we are already seeing some gains in safety. No more null pointers, surprising exceptions, or fragile code. We can stop here and pat ourselves on our backs.\n\nBut we can do even better. Not lying is just the first step in a productive relationship. The next step would be to start sharing knowledge. The simplest way to start doing that is to sprinkle our code with more types.\n\nWhen we use a string or an int in our code, what do they actually mean? Rarely is it just an arbitrary number or some raw text. Usually they represent some concept like a user ID or a file name. The thing is that this special meaning of the int or string are not reflected anywhere outside our head, or maybe a comment.\n\nAs time goes by we have more and more different meanings that an int can take in our system. Maybe it's an app ID, or a post ID, or a feed ID? Who knows. And so confusion arises, you start mixing up your ints, weird bugs creep up.\n\nWhile this is happening, the compiler remains silent, \"an int is an int, what can you do...\". We didn't share our knowledge with the compiler, we have no one to blame.\n\nThe fix is simple: use small, typed wrappers, sometimes called \"tiny types\". Each concept you have in your system deserves to have a unique type, something for the compiler to hold on to. So you would have a UserID type, an AppID type, and so on. Underneath they might all be simple ints, but now both you and, more importantly, the compiler can distinguish the different concepts in code.\n\nThe difference might seem small, but the consequences are far reaching. Extra safety, the compiler will no longer let us confuse the different ints, is just the beginning.\n\nOnce the compiler gained knowledge of a concept you can use it for various tasks. For example, suppose you want to find out where are all the usages of user IDs in code. If we were still using ints, asking the compiler for all usages of the type int is meaningless, there are too many of those and they mean different things. Searching variable names is easy, but the results might not be complete. But if we have a dedicated type for UserID, that's easy, just ask your editor to find usages of the type and you get the precise results you need. The compiler keeps track.\n\nFor the same reasons, refactoring becomes easy. You want to change the representation of the UserID? Add some extra salt for security? No need to search for all the relevant ints and pray for the best. Modify the type and follow the compilation errors. Done.\n\nNeed some special validation for user IDs? Hide the constructor of UserID, add an alternative \"smart\" constructor, follow compilation errors. Done. No need to chase different ints across the system.\n\nAnd for us humans, descriptive, domain-specific types make function signatures more readable, both for developers and for the occasional stakeholder. What's not to like about it?\n\nSimple typed wrappers are, well, simple. But sometimes we need more sophisticated types to express ourselves to the compiler.\n\nDid you ever stumble on a class Foo that has too many fields with a long comment that explains something along the lines of \"if field a is true then fields b and c must not be null\". And so on and so forth for a few more different conditions?\n\nThen when you actually start trusting Foo's comment and check that a is true, you discover, with a production null pointer exception, that b was actually null.\n\nTo describe this more formally, Foo had some invariants, and those invariants were violated. Not every combination of field values makes sense for our application.\n\nHow much nicer it would if the compiler could tell us \"hey, look here, this invariant breaks if you use this set of field values\"? Unfortunately, most compilers are incapable of expressing invariants that depend in such a way on runtime values.\n\nThe solution to many such problems is to remodel the type to better reflect the invariants that we want to encode, in such a way that the compiler will be able to follow along and only allow for legal combinations.\n\nOne of the most versatile tools for this is to use union, or sealed types (enums in some languages). With a union type we create one variant per case. And each case can only have a legal combination of values. So the case where a is true will become one variant with two non-nullable fields b and c. And that's it.\n\nThe advantage of taking this approach is that the union type doesn't even allow us to write down an invalid combination. You can only choose from valid ones, anything else is a compilation error.\n\nThe way you work with union types is that every time you need to access some data you need to match on the value. And then you act according to the case you're on. If you're in case a, you're guaranteed to have the b and c values. The compiler makes sure they are consistently there no matter how you got to this point of code.\n\nThis can make union types more powerful than tests that check invariants. Unlike a unit test, which can only test for a specific code paths you currently know about, the compiler can track all code paths, now and forever.\n\nAs mentioned before, in some languages the compiler can auto-complete the different cases relevant for the point in code you're at. Sometimes it feels like the code is writing itself, you just have to fill in the blanks.\n\nWhen the code evolves over time and more cases are added, the compiler will notify you about all the relevant places where you need to update the logic to handle new cases. This is a great way to assess the consequences of changes you're about to make and help you with decisions at the design phase.\n\nUsing union types this way is a great way to model alternative states in code, and it's part of a more general approach to programming where you strive to \"make illegal states unrepresentable\". That is, encode your invariants as facts that the compiler can enforce and makes it impossible to even write code that will break those invariants.\n\nThis opens up a whole new way of approaching types.\n\nWe are used to think about types as just a way to distinguish different values. This one's a string, that one an int. But as we rely more on the compiler to help us we can start thinking about types as guarantees that we want from the type-system. Or facts that we expect to hold, and that the compiler should verify for us.\n\nA common scenario is that we want to make sure that the list we got as an argument contains at least one item. A classic example is when we need to compute some average, it's undefined for empty lists. Or choose a payment method in a payments system, you must have at least one to be able to proceed.\n\nWhat we could do is revert to defensive programming, check the list before proceeding, and throw an exception if it's empty. But being defensive all the time is tedious (and eventually you forget about it), and we are back to lying to the compiler. Instead, we can signal our intentions with a type: NonEmptyList, a list type that cannot be even constructed without at least one element (some languages have it builtin, but it's also easy to implement in a library).\n\nNot only does this communicate our intent to our callers better than any comment can do, but it also forces the compiler to make sure that nobody can call us with an illegal value. Once we encoded a guarantee as a type, we don't have to worry about it anymore. No defensive programming, no need to write extra tests for it. No more fear that some future refactor will break our invariants.\n\nOnce we start thinking about guarantees the compiler can make for us, the opportunities are endless. You can come up with a type for pretty much anything (within reason):\n\nAnd the list goes on, for almost any kind of custom validation logic you might want. Some can be encoded with union types, some might require techniques like smart constructors. You don't have to get too fancy for this to become a valuable tool.\n\nOnce you start sprinkling these types around, not only is the intent of the code becomes clearer, but the compiler can help verify that everything is consistent, and that any new code knows what it's required to do.\n\nWith enough types in place you might get the feeling that \"if it compiles, ship it\".\n\nIn the prologue we saw what I think is a fairly common story, null unexpectedly crashing a production system. But we can make this story very concrete. I'm sure that many of us felt the Google Cloud outage in June 2025. So many services around the world were affected that it was very hard to miss.\n\nFrom the incident report we learn that the root cause of it all was a null value where it was unexpected (along with some other operational compounding issues, like a lack of randomized backoff). And it's not really surprising. We saw that nulls are lies that we tell the compiler, values that it cannot track for us. In a large enough system, you are bound to lose track of them.\n\nWith the lessons that we learned, can we imagine another outcome? An outcome that doesn't involve a big chunk of the internet crashing?\n\nSo we already know that using null is lying to the compiler. If we are motivated enough we will never use a null in our code, opting instead for something that the compiler can track, an option-like type. The first step of not lying to the compiler might be the most difficult one, but once we take it a whole new world opens up for us.\n\nThe incident report mentions some \"unintended blank fields\" in Policy datatype that triggered the whole thing. Although I don't know the actual details, let's imagine that those fields used to be non-empty and now we want to open the possibility for making them empty. But we no longer have null at our disposal, what do we do? We change the type of the fields to be \"option-of-X\", and run the compiler. This is where the magic of dialogue starts to shine.\n\nIn a large codebase and a central entity like Policy you can imagine that you'll have many compilation errors the moment you set some fields to be optional. That sounds scary, but that's way better than null silently propagating all over the code and not knowing the consequences. With the compilation errors you now have a full report of all the code sites you need to reconsider.\n\nYou start going over them, one by one, fixing the errors. But the more errors you fix the more you feel that something's not right. Adapting the code feels like too much effort, too hacky, \"a maze of twisty little ifs, all alike\". That's the compiler trying to tell you something:\n\nMaybe you need to reconsider the design?\n\nAnd that's what you do, with all those changes that you had to make it becomes more obvious that these are not just fields that you made optional, what you really did is uncover a new flow in the system, with new rules. In the old flow the fields really are mandatory, in the new flow they are no longer needed. So you combined the two flows and made the fields optional. But by just setting the fields to be options the new flow becomes implicit in a combination of empty values and flags, something that the compiler can't track, and is not apparent when reading the code.\n\nInstead of riding on the existing flow and tweaking it, you can make things explicit and turn Policy into a union type. If it already was a union, you add another case to describe the new flow, and you compile again. There are still many compilation errors, matches that are incomplete, but now they are telling you something different:\n\nIf you want to support this new flow, here are all the things you need to consider\n\nAnd that's what you do reviewing the compilation errors and figuring out what the new flow implies at each site. Maybe along the way you discover that the new Policy type requires different validations that you didn't think of before. As a result in the new Policy you start using a NonEmptyList of AvailabilityZones which guarantees that you can't run the new flow without at least one applicable AvailabilityZone. (Of course AvailabilityZone is not some plain string, you have a dedicated type that tells you exactly what it means and gets validates accordingly.)\n\nYou compile again and somewhere along the edges of the system where you process user input the compiler tells you:\n\nListen, I don't have any way to prove that you actually have at least on availability zone provided by the user\n\nAnd the compiler is right, if you were just using a regular list to represent the availability zones you would've missed this. Input processing happens far away from where we actually require the availability zones to not be empty and your unit tests missed this. So you add the appropriate user input validation. And lo and behold, it compiles. Ship it!\n\nYes, you struggled with the compiler, and yes it took some time. But guess who's getting good night's sleep tonight?",

    "description": "President Trump’s trade policy, inflation and climbing stock prices shaped business and the economy this year.",
    "fullText": "In recent years, macroeconomic tides have ebbed and flowed, but one thing has remained unchanged: Americans’ dim views of the economy.\n\nIn 2023, pundits warned of the “vibecession.” In 2024, concerns about the economy and inflation were top of mind for voters in the presidential race.\n\nThis year, economic pessimism has persisted, as President Trump’s sweeping economic proposals, from his wide-ranging tariffs to his plan to remake the Federal Reserve, have raised uncertainty to new highs. And the economic data is sending mixed, and muddled, signals.\n\nHere are 14 charts that illustrate how uncertainty has unfolded in the economy and markets over the last year, and how it might affect the next.\n\nPresident Trump’s trade war has been one of the biggest sources of economic uncertainty this year. During his campaign, Trump repeatedly cited tariffs as a way to spur American manufacturing, create new jobs and lower U.S. trade deficits.\n\nNearly every country has seen import duties rise.\n\nThe tariffs have made progress toward some of the administration’s stated goals: They have brought the trade deficit down, as exports grew more than imports.\n\nAnd they have made money: Tariff revenues are now at record highs.\n\nBut there is another kind of deficit on investors’ minds: the federal budget deficit. Tariff revenues remain a small share of total government revenues.\n\nHere’s another way in which the effects of tariffs are showing up: higher prices for goods.\n\nConsumer prices started to accelerate in June, and the prices of products most exposed to tariffs notched some of the highest gains.\n\nAnd in recent months, prices for goods continued to rise, contributing more to inflation.\n\nInflation unexpectedly slowed to 2.7 percent in November, according to data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics this week. But economists have advised taking this data with a grain of salt, because of disruptions in the bureau’s data collection efforts during the 43-day federal government shutdown.\n\nIt’s still unclear whether tariffs will cause just a temporary increase in prices or if they will feed into more persistent inflation.\n\nAt this month’s DealBook Summit, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent pushed back against the notion that tariffs had contributed to inflation, saying that they had caused a “one-time price adjustment,” not a “generalized price increase.”\n\nThe chair of the Federal Reserve, Jerome H. Powell, has also said that the Fed expected tariffs to cause a “one-time shift in the price level.” But he has stressed that the increase could be drawn out over several quarters. And at a news conference after last week’s Fed meeting he acknowledged the risk of tariff inflation becoming “more and more persistent.”\n\nIn the first full jobs report since the federal shutdown, the B.L.S. reported that the unemployment rate rose to 4.6 percent last month, a four-year high. Wage growth slowed to its lowest level since 2021. As with inflation, the shutdown affected the data collection for these measures, and the agency said ahead of the release that its estimates of the unemployment rate and other measures would be subject to more uncertainty than usual.\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThe average job gain over the last three months\n\nThere was a silver lining: Employers added 64,000 jobs in November, driven largely by gains in the health care sector. But that only partly offset a decline in October.\n\nThe federal government shed 168,000 jobs in October and November, as workers who accepted the Trump administration’s “deferred resignation” offer came off the payroll.\n\nAnd the jobs numbers do not reflect a big downward revision that is expected early next year.\n\n(Revisions to jobs figures are commonplace, but they dominated headlines earlier this year when downward adjustments led Trump to fire the commissioner of the B.L.S., Erika McEntarfer, claiming, without evidence, that the data was “rigged.”)\n\nThe lowest-paid workers have felt the strain of the cooling labor market the most. As the economy started to recover from the pandemic, demand for labor far outstripped supply in the lowest-paid industries, such as leisure and hospitality.\n\nToday, that is no longer the case, and hourly wages are rising most slowly for the lowest earners.\n\nLast year, voters consistently told pollsters that they trusted Donald Trump over Joe Biden and later, Kamala Harris, to do a better job on the economy.\n\nNow, Trump is the one feeling the pressure, as views of his handling of the economy have soured since the summer.\n\nThe risks posed by inflation and a softening labor market have also put the Fed in a tough position. Last week, the central bank decided to cut interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for a third meeting in a row. But the decision was highly contentious, with three of 12 policymakers voting against it.\n\nPowell said he could have made the case either way for the Fed to cut interest rates or pause reductions, given the competing risks to unemployment and inflation.\n\n“You’ve got one tool,” he said. “You can’t do two things at once.”\n\nTrump, for his part, has made no secret of his desire for lower rates. Next year, he will select a new Fed chair.\n\nAfter a dip earlier this year, most notably amid the chaotic “Liberation Day” tariff rollout, the stock market has, on the whole, kept on going up. The S&P 500 reached a record high just last week, for the 37th time this year.\n\nArguably, company earnings, and their expectations for earnings are the most important factor driving the market movements.\n\nIn fact, earnings expectations have moved in tandem with the S&P 500 price index over the course of this year (again, with the exception of the early months of the year).\n\nOf course, the S&P 500 is driven in large part by big tech companies, which are intertwined with the A.I. boom.\n\nThat has been cause for concern for some investors, who see a parallel between this moment and the dot-com bubble of the late 1990s and early 2000s. But unlike companies leading the stock rally during the dot-com bubble, the public companies with the steepest valuation gains today are earning more as the market goes up.\n\nThe outlook for earnings continues to be bullish in 2026, though there could be weak links in the A.I. chain.\n\nThe crypto boom that Trump’s re-election ushered in is on pause for now.\n\nAfter surging for most of the year, the price of Bitcoin and Ether, along with dozens of other coins, started to plummet on Oct. 10, following Trump’s announcement that he would impose a new tariff on China.\n\n(The stock market on that day also saw the biggest one-day plunge since April, though it has since rebounded and hit a record high.)\n\nFor some, the crypto sell-off has underscored the fact that crypto remains a volatile investment, even as it has entered a new level of mainstream acceptance. Amid a high-stakes lobbying campaign by the crypto industry, Trump ended a regulatory crackdown on crypto and signed legislation outlining the first federal rules for stablecoins, digital tokens tied to assets like the U.S. dollar.\n\nOthers worry that a crypto crash could bleed over to the wider market.\n\nAmid all this uncertainty, people might be looking to pop culture as a form of escape. They haven’t necessarily been finding it at the movies, if ticket sales are any indication.\n\nSummer is a crucial season for Hollywood, accounting for the lion’s share of annual box office revenue. This year, fantasies, science-fiction sequels and superhero flicks were on offer. But moviegoers, for the most part, didn’t bite: It was the worst summer for domestic ticket sales since 1981, after adjusting for inflation and excluding the pandemic years.\n\nThe fall was filled with star-studded flicks, but none of them constituted box office hits.\n\nCan the holiday season help Hollywood make a comeback? “Zootopia 2” and “Wicked: For Good” have gotten it off to a good start.\n\nBut broader concerns abound. Warner Bros. Discovery has struck a deal with Netflix for the Warner Bros. studio and its sibling streaming service, HBO Max, while it has fended off, for the time being, a hostile takeover offer from Paramount.\n\nRegardless of how it all ends, it feels like a moment of loss for cinephiles. Corporate consolidation, after all, is not likely to bode well for the future of the Silver Screen.",

    "fullText": "I remember learning about cronjobs in the early 2000s. I could tell the computer to go do something, on a recurring basis, forever, even when I wasn't there. They felt like magic!\n\nWe didn't have Crontab.guru or AI to ask for figuring out some of the more complex specifications. Just the man pages and good old-fashioned trial and error—mostly error in my case.\n\nBut while you could do fun, complex specifications of recurring intervals, you couldn't quite specify something quite as dynamic as \"run this script every Tuesday at 7am unless it's the last Tuesday of the month...\"\n\nOr at least, you couldn't strictly through the crontab specification syntax. But I had a recent, mildly embarrassing epiphany that it's not hard at all to add arbitrary checks to your crontab to account for more complex and dynamic scenarios.\n\nWant to run a script every Tuesday of the month at 7am except for the last Tuesday? That's easy—set up your crontab to run every Tuesday at 7am, but add a little check to make sure the next week is still part of the same month:\n\nIf it's not part of the same month, that means we're on the last Tuesday for the month and the script won't run.\n\nNote: The -v flag is for the macOS/BSD flavors of date. On Linux you'd want to use -d +7 days instead.\n\nThis really has nothing to do with cronjobs at all and everything to do with the POSIX \"test\" command which is the thing we're using with those square brackets. I'm used to seeing and utilizing them in shell scripts, but for whatever reason I never thought to reach for that tool here in the crontab.\n\nYou could just as easily rewrite it like this, skipping the bracket shorthand, which is probably easier to read:\n\nIt never crossed my mind until recently to add slightly more complex checks at the crontab level.\n\nMaybe fetch a list of all the US Holidays for a given year and store them in a handy HOLIDAYS.txt file somewhere:\n\nNow you can update your cronjob to run every Tuesday at 7am except on Holidays:\n\nOr inversely, maybe run a holiday-only script that checks once a day\n\nThe National Weather Service makes all kinds of fun data available (if you can find it...). How about a script that runs every hour, but only when the weather is clear?\n\nOr maybe when the weather is cloudy?\n\nOr maybe we get in line with every-other-startup I'm aware of and throw AI at the problem, only running our script when the LLM gods have decided there is something newsworthy:\n\nPublished on Sunday, September 21st 2025.

    "fullText": "Halo Studios has undergone dramatic changes in recent months, amid a turbulent 2025 for Xbox games. Rebs Gaming has been tracking new hires who all share experience with AI tools. With an AI consultant replacing Melissa Boone as Chief of Staff, the technology looks poised to infiltrate game development.\n\nScanning LinkedIn and job listings, the YouTuber noticed a familiar pattern. The most significant recent change was the arrival of Angela Hession at Halo Studios. The new Chief of Staff previously led the Gaming Safety and Trust team at Microsoft. However, she also founded a company specializing in AI-driven productivity enhancement.\n\nAnother new job ad at Xbox Game Studios seeks an Applied Scientist focused on machine learning. Not only would the employee work on Halo games, but also on other Microsoft franchises like Forza and Gears of War. Several current Halo developers in key roles have added qualifications related to generative AI.\n\nHow studios will employ artificial intelligence has become a point of controversy. Many companies argue that it’s a resource that boosts the output of developers. Yet, critics worry that human artists will lose creative control and, ultimately, their jobs.\n\nPerhaps the best indication of how Halo Studios will employ the tools came from a 2024 job posting. The studio was searching for a Senior AI Engineer to “leverage generative AI and ML to augment in-game experiences and to improve how we make games.” The description implied that the technology will aid more than rudimentary office tasks.\n\nRebs Gaming stresses the distinction between AI as a tool vs an author. Either way, it wouldn’t be surprising if Halo: Campaign Evolved or a follow-up title ushers in a new era of development. Microsoft has fully embraced artificial intelligence, building hundreds of data centers. Some analysts have attributed the closure of other Xbox Game Studios to that monumental investment.\n\nRebs Gaming YouTube, Microsoft Careers, Rebs Gaming X account",

(AP) — California this week dropped a lawsuit officials filed against the Trump administration over the federal government's withdrawing of $4 billion for the state's long-delayed high-speed rail project.\n\nThe U.S. Transportation Department slashed funds for the bullet train aimed at connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles in July. The Trump administration has said the California High-Speed Rail Authority had “ no viable plan ” to complete a large segment of the project in the farm-rich Central Valley.\n\nThe authority quickly filed a lawsuit, with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom calling the federal government's decision “a political stunt to punish California.”\n\nThe authority said this week that it would focus on other funding sources to complete the project, which is estimated to cost more than $100 billion.\n\n“This action reflects the State’s assessment that the federal government is not a reliable, constructive, or trustworthy partner in advancing high-speed rail in California,” an authority spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nThe Transportation Department did not respond to a request for comment. President Donald Trump and Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy have both previously criticized the project as a “train to nowhere.”\n\n“The Railroad we were promised still does not exist, and never will,” Trump said on his social media platform Truth Social in July. “This project was Severely Overpriced, Overregulated, and NEVER DELIVERED.”\n\nThe authority's decision to drop the lawsuit comes as the group seeks private investors to support the bullet train. The project recently secured $1 billion in annual funding from the state's cap-and-trade program through 2045.\n\nThe program sets a declining limit on total planet-warming emissions in the state from major polluters. Companies must reduce their emissions, buy allowances from the state or other businesses, or fund projects aimed at offsetting their emissions. Money the state receives from the sales funds climate-change mitigation, affordable housing and transportation projects, as well as utility bill credits for Californians.\n\nThe rail authority said its shift in focus away from federal funding offers “a new opportunity.”\n\n“Moving forward without the Trump administration’s involvement allows the Authority to pursue proven global best practices used successfully by modern high-speed rail systems around the world,” a spokesperson said in a statement.",

Speaking about a 20-point plan under discussion, Zelenskyy outlined the most difficult points, noting that Ukraine has already conveyed its position to Washington, which is expected to communicate it to Moscow.\n\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Friday that the Kremlin had already been in contact with U.S. representatives since Russian presidential envoy Kirill Dmitriev recently met with U.S. envoys in Florida. However, he did not reveal any details, saying only: “It was agreed upon to continue the dialogue.”\n\nZelenskyy said talks continue over the nature and scope of security guarantees that would be provided to Ukraine under any agreement. He said several technical issues remain, including how guarantees would be enforced and what monitoring mechanisms would be used to ensure compliance.\n\nZelenskyy said the fate of the territories that Russia claims remain the most difficult issue in the talks. He did not provide details, but has repeatedly said Kyiv will not recognize Russian control over occupied regions, including areas seized since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. Zelenskyy has also repeatedly stated Ukraine will not cede territories it currently controls, which Russia has publicly demanded.\n\nZaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\n\nZelenskyy said the future of the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains unresolved. The facility, Europe’s largest, has been under Russian control since early on in the war and has raised repeated international safety concerns due to fighting nearby.\n\nUkraine has been consistent in saying that safe operation of the station requires demilitarization of its territory, where Russia currently has troops stationed. Apart from that, Ukraine has been insisting that Ukrainian workers should be granted full access to the station, which they currently don’t have.\n\nDetails previously released in the course of the current negotiations revealed that the U.S. and Ukrainian teams are in discussion of a joint-access format, potentially between all three sides (the U.S., Ukraine, and Russia).\n\nZelenskyy said further discussions between Ukrainian and U.S. teams are expected, including talks in Florida, and that separate documents on economic recovery and prosperity are also under consideration.",

    "description": "\"The tip of the iceberg.\"",
    "fullText": "Decades after its demise in the wild, a resilient herbivore has bounced back and could form the vanguard in the battle to curb the Sahara Desert's expansion.\n\nThe BBC reported on the continuing conservation success story that is the scimitar-horned oryx's remarkable comeback. Desert nomads sustainably hunted them for centuries, but their hides, horns, and tasty flesh led to overhunting with modern equipment, and their wild population was wiped out. However, thanks to international cooperation and captive breeding programs, the oryx have been successfully reintroduced into the wild.\n\nRewilding a species is a tough ask. It requires addressing the issues that led to a species' disappearance in the first place. Even then, there's no guarantee of success.\n\nOne of the earliest oryx reintroductions happened in 1985. Ten oryx from Marwell and Edinburgh Zoo were released in the Bou-Hedma National Park in Tunisia. \"It could have gone horribly wrong, but they've been there ever since,\" said Tania Gilbert, a conservation scientist at Marwell Wildlife.\n\nIt's not a huge surprise, given how incredibly resilient and uniquely suited to the desert they are. Oryx get all of their moisture from grazing, so they can go years without drinking water, and their almost absurdly high internal temperature (116°F) allows them to tolerate temperatures few animals can stand, per the Smithsonian.\n\nAs they feed and move on, they spread seeds and much-needed nutrients to the desert's edge through their waste. Seeds dispersed through dung are 250 times more likely to germinate. Oryx are also an important part of the food web as prey. It's hoped that the oryx's revival will help contain the expansion of the Sahara Desert.\n\nSince 1920, the Sahara Desert has grown by 10%. According to Earth.Org, it grows by an average of 48 kilometers (approximately 30 miles) every year. About a third of that expansion is driven by human activity, and its long-term implications are considerable. Food insecurity, water scarcity, and biodiversity loss will all result from an expanded Sahara.\n\nOryx alone won't solve the problem, but they can be part of the solution. Their short-term prospects are promising, but to sustain the species' growth, a combination of raising awareness and working with local communities is needed.\n\nJohn Newby described the progress as \"the tip of the iceberg\" and told the BBC: \"The other nine-tenths of the iceberg is hidden under the water — and that's going to depend on human behaviour and the ability of people to accommodate wildlife within their lives and livelihoods.\"\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "Kennedy Center president Richard Grenell lambasted a performer’s decision to cancel an annual Christmas Eve jazz concert, following the addition of President Donald Trump’s name to the Washington, DC, arts venue.\n\nIn a letter, which the Kennedy Center shared a copy of with CNN, Grenell sharply criticizes jazz artist Chuck Redd’s actions and praises Trump for his leadership as the center’s chairman — a role the president’s handpicked board elected him to early in his second term after he ousted his predecessor.\n\n“Your decision to withdraw at the last moment—explicitly in response to the Center’s recent renaming, which honors President Trump’s extraordinary efforts to save this national treasure—is classic intolerance and very costly to a non-profit Arts institution,” Grenell, a longtime Trump confidant, wrote to Redd on letterhead bearing the new “Trump Kennedy Center” logo.\n\nThe Associated Press first reported on the letter.\n\nRedd told CNN on Wednesday that he canceled the holiday jazz concert, which he has hosted for nearly two decades, after seeing the board’s move to rename the building last week.\n\n“I’ve been performing at the Kennedy Center since the beginning of my career and I was saddened to see this name change,” Redd said.\n\nGrenell goes on to fault Redd for financial fallout relating to what he called a “political stunt” and said the center will seek $1 million in damages.\n\nCNN has reached out to Redd for comment on the letter.\n\nRoma Daravi, vice president of public relations at the Kennedy Center, echoed Grenell’s sentiment, arguing that Redd “failed to meet the basic duty of a public artist: to perform for all people.”\n\n“Art is a shared cultural experience meant to unite, not exclude,” Daravi said in a statement to CNN. “The Trump Kennedy Center is a true bipartisan institution that welcomes artists and patrons from all backgrounds—great art transcends politics, and America’s cultural center remains committed to presenting popular programming that inspires and resonates with all audiences.”\n\nThe cancelation of the free “Jazz Jam” show followed a vote by the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts’s board of trustees to rename the cultural institution for both the Democratic former president and Trump last week.\n\nIn the hours after the vote, the center updated its website and the following day installed new signage to the facade of the building bearing Trump’s name.\n\nThe move quickly sparked outrage from Kennedy family, lawmakers and patrons of the historic center, including a lawsuit from one Democratic congresswoman challenging whether the board has the authority to rename the facility, which Congress designated in 1964 as a memorial to the 35th president.\n\nPrior to the renaming, Trump’s overhaul of the center was already raising concerns about lost revenue as both artists and audiences flee for other venues. Artists including Issa Rae, Renée Fleming, Shonda Rhimes and Ben Folds resigned from their leadership roles or canceled events at the space. And Jeffrey Seller, producer of the hit musical “Hamilton,” canceled the show’s planned run earlier this year.\n\nThis holiday season, lagging ticket sales have also impacted “The Nutcracker,” historically one of the center’s most popular events. Approximately 10,000 seats were sold for this year’s production across seven performances, compared with around 15,000 seats each in the 2021 through 2024 performances, according to internal sales data reviewed by CNN.\n\nThe Kennedy Center comped approximately five times more tickets for the performances this year than in the past four years, the data showed. And this year’s show has fallen about half a million dollars short of its $1.5 million budgeted revenue goal.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional details.\n\nCNN’s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "BEIJING, Dec 26 (Reuters) - Chinese companies developing reusable commercial rockets will have access to a fast lane for initial public offerings on the tech-heavy STAR market that ​exempts them from some financial requirements, the Shanghai Stock Exchange said on Friday.\n\nBeijing is seeking ‌to address a gap in its space capabilities compared to the United States, which is currently dominant in the ability to return, ‌recover, and reuse a rocket's first stage, or booster, after it is launched.\n\nThe new guidelines build upon previous regulations published in June that made it easier for pre-profit innovative companies to get listed on the STAR market.\n\nThe fast lane exempts Chinese rocket firms from profitability and minimum revenue thresholds and instead requires them to ⁠have met key technological milestones, including ‌one successful orbital launch using reusable rocket technology.\n\nCHINA AIMING TO BREAK US, SPACEX STRANGLEHOLD\n\nU.S. billionaire Elon Musk's aerospace giant SpaceX currently holds a near monopoly on this ‍technology, and its signature Falcon 9 is the only reusable rocket model that is regularly launched and used to put satellites into orbit.\n\nEarlier this month, China's leading private rocket firm LandSpace became the first domestic entity to carry out ​a full reusable rocket test with the launch of its new Zhuque-3 model, signalling its ambition to ‌catch up to SpaceX.\n\nWhile the launch failed to complete the crucial step of recovering the rocket's booster, a flurry of Chinese state-owned and private players are now rushing to test launch their own reusable rockets.\n\nLandSpace has already said it wants to demonstrate a successful rocket recovery in mid-2026, when Zhuque-3 will be launched for a second time. But it has said the capital-intensive nature of rocket development means it ⁠will need access to China's capital markets if it hopes ​to compete with SpaceX.\n\nThe Shanghai exchange's rules do not state ​that rocket firms must successfully recover a rocket, only that reusable rocket technology be used to put a satellite into orbit, something LandSpace already achieved with this month's launch.\n\nCompanies ‍that undertake national missions ⁠or participate in major state-led space projects will receive priority support, according to the new guidelines, which take effect immediately, underscoring the close alignment between commercial launch activity and China's broader strategic ⁠goals.\n\nChina has repeatedly described SpaceX's monopoly on low-Earth orbit satellites as a national security risk and is actively pushing its own ‌satellite constellations, which it hopes will number in the tens of thousands within the ‌next decades.",

    "fullText": "KANSAS CITY, Kan. — The Kansas City Chiefs are coming to Kansas City, Kansas as state leaders and team leadership announced the plan Monday.\n\nKansas is issuing Sales Tax and Revenue or STAR Bonds to pay for more than half of the $3 billion project. The state issues STAR Bonds to private investors and pays them back with new tax revenue.\n\nJohnson County officials, fans celebrate Chiefs stadium move\n\nRepublican State Senate President Ty Masterson said one of his requirements for approving the stadium deal as the Chair of the Legislative Coordinating Council (LCC) was that it wouldn’t lead to higher taxes. Masterson talked to FOX4 on Tuesday while he was in Andover, just a day after he was in Topeka for the big announcement.\n\n“Nobody. Worst case scenario, nobody buys the bonds, the bonds don’t get sold, the project doesn’t happen,” Masterson said when asked who’s on the hook if there isn’t the private interest in the buying of these bonds.\n\n“Not at all, I’m excited,” he said when asked if that concerned him at all that that’s a possibility.\n\n“I think there’s going to be general excitement. I think they’re even going to get a good rate for their bonds.”\n\nFOX4 took that comment to Washburn Political Science Professor Bob Beatty in Topeka. He says the nearly $2 billion in STAR Bonds that will be issued is a bit of an experience with the Chiefs stadium going up somewhere near I-70 and I-435 in Wyandotte County.\n\n“That being said, there’s an adage that basically goes around where you don’t bet against the NFL, Beatty said.\n\n“It has become a global phenomenon, and from the salaries, and the costs of stadiums and the amount of money that’s generated, and yes, even now the cache of Taylor Swift and celebrities, it’s not necessarily always a rational economic decision.”\n\nKC mayor vows to compete like hell’ in renewed border war after Chiefs announce move to Kansas\n\nTwo and a half hours after the Beatty interview, Kansas Department of Commerce Marketing and Communications Director Patrick Lowry sent FOX4 a statement.\n\n“The excitement surrounding bringing the Chiefs to Kansas and the new economic opportunities the stadium, facilities, and mixed-use developments will create, are sound reasons to be confident in the success of this project,” Lowry said.\n\nThe STAR Bond District appears to cover all of KCK, not to mention Western Johnson County.\n\n“I would say that with all humility, bringing the National Football League to Wyandotte and building the facility that we’re going to build is going to drive development,” Chiefs President Mark Donovan said Monday in relation to a question about the STAR Bond District.",

    "description": "Jane Newman says it's been easy to meet new people in Seoul, including through a fan group for a Korean actor she likes.",
    "fullText": "Jane Newman spent her evenings watching K-dramas on her recliner during the pandemic lockdowns. She didn't expect they'd spark a curiosity about South Korea that would eventually lead her to move there and start over.\n\nIn 2023, Newman was working for a consulting firm in Brisbane, Australia. As a manager, her heavy workload didn't let up even as the world began to return to normal.\n\nAfter months of long hours spent in front of a screen, she was burned out and beginning to feel the strain.\n\n\"I started out with a whole lot of shoulder and back pain, and then it developed into arm pain, and I couldn't use my mouse,\" Newman, now 60, told Business Insider.\n\nStanding desks and different chairs fixed little, so she took a sabbatical.\n\nNewman had first visited South Korea the previous year, curious about the country she'd only seen on TV. Remembering how much she had enjoyed that trip, she decided to return for a two-month break.\n\nWhen she went back to work, the symptoms didn't take long to resurface. This time, Newman found herself struggling mentally and emotionally, too.\n\n\"I found it more and more difficult to do my work,\" she said. By July 2024, she and her employer agreed it was best for her to step away from the company.\n\n\"I knew that South Korea was a place that I loved, and it made me feel good,\" Newman said. \"So I made the decision to go back and stay for a few months to see how it felt.\"\n\nFor three months, she lived in an Airbnb in Gwacheon, a city just outside Seoul. Newman lived with her host, a local woman who had invited her to participate in the community events.\n\nThere, she joined a group supporting former US military \"comfort women,\" as well as two English clubs where members met to discuss news, read English fiction together, and give weekly presentations on various topics.\n\n\"I met the most wonderful people, and they really invited me into their conversations. And I got to know a lot more about Korea itself, and its history,\" she said.\n\n\"All of those things made me feel really welcomed, and at home, and part of a community, which is what I was really lacking back in Australia,\" Newman added.\n\nIn Brisbane, her social life largely revolved around people she knew at work, or old friends she'd kept in touch with from her years living in the UK when her daughters were young. She was part of a bushwalking community and a social dining community, but most of those groups faded after the pandemic.\n\nAs Newman considered her next career steps, she found herself drawn toward public speaking and coaching to help people navigate the pressures of modern society and technology.\n\nThat focus also eventually led her to begin developing a tech startup in South Korea aimed at helping young people struggling with social isolation.\n\nShe said her Gen Z daughters weren't surprised by her decision since they already knew how much she loved South Korea. Both had already taken trips to visit her there.\n\nWhen it was time for Newman to look for an apartment, she wanted a place that was close to public transport, with separate spaces for living and sleeping, and a good view.\n\nIt took her about two weeks to find a place. She now lives in Dongdaemun, a popular neighborhood, where her two-bedroom apartment costs 1.43 million Korean won, or about $1,000, a month.\n\nSouth Korea has become an increasingly popular choice for foreigners in recent years.\n\nData from the Ministry of Justice showed that the number of foreigners living in South Korea at the end of 2024 stood at 2.65 million, a 5.7% increase from the year before.\n\nFor Newman, building friendships in Seoul came more naturally than she expected.\n\n\"I've found that every time I've come to Korea, I've made new friends,\" Newman said, adding that this included people she met through a fan group for a Korean actor she admired.\n\nThese days, Newman's routine is a mix of work and settling into life in Seoul.\n\nShe starts her mornings with a coffee from the Starbucks across the street before diving into her coaching sessions and working on getting her startup off the ground.\n\nCompared to her previous job, where working 60 hours a week was common, Newman says she now works around 20 to 30 hours a week.\n\nWith the more flexible schedule, she has time to exercise, meet people, and sometimes work from libraries or cafés.\n\n\"But I do make sure I get out once a day to go out and enjoy this beautiful place I'm living in,\" she said.\n\nDo you have a story to share about relocating to a new city?

    "description": "The Canes’ hot 11-2 start has given reason for optimism towards a potential run to the NCAA Tournament.",
    "fullText": "The Jai Lucas era for Miami Hurricanes basketball is 13 games in. After non-conference play, UM has compiled a record of 11-2. With a completely new roster, the 2025-26 Canes have already surpassed the win total from the disastrous 2024-25 season, in which Miami went 7-24.\n\nA group, mostly comprised of former Florida high school stars, has injected new life into this once-dormant program. Even though it’s still early, it is hard not to be encouraged about this mostly stress-free start to this season. Yes, teams don’t show their true colors until conference play begins, but this squad has been rocking.\n\nFormer Indiana big man Malik Reneau has risen to expectations, acting as the team’s main option and being the star of this season’s team. His sidekicks include the board-collecting Ernest Udeh and young freshman Shelton Henderson, who has already taken steps towards being a star at this level.\n\nThe backcourt duo of Tre Donaldson and Tru Washington has coalesced to a tee. Both have brought big-game experience, aggressiveness, lots of scoring, and shutdown defense. Their play styles have matched harmoniously. Timotej Malovic, nicknamed “Threemo,” has provided much-needed shooting. Freshman Dante Allen has shown flashes of being a great floor general, although he hasn’t played since late November thanks to an injury.\n\nFellow Euros, Salih Altuntas and Noam Dovrat have provided solid minutes off the bench. The potential is there. The talent and skill are the best the program has seen in years. There is some legitimate depth. Not to mention, Miami has also picked up two quality wins over Georgetown in the ESPN Events Invitational and against Ole Miss.\n\nThe Ole Miss victory back on December 2 was the program’s first true road win since a victory at Notre Dame in January of 2024. Although postseason predictions are still too early to make calls on, this Miami team looks to have all the ingredients needed to make the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIf this team were to accomplish that goal, it would be regarded as one of the greatest single-season turnarounds in college basketball history. As of now, it doesn’t sound too outlandish. The many pairs of eyeballs surrounding the college hoops world have taken notice of Miami’s fast start, as Lucas’ squad is getting a hint of consideration for being regarded as a Top 25 team.\n\nIn the recent week 8 poll, UM has received four votes, and they could soon make the national rankings with a solid start to ACC play. Not only are the intangibles there, but the desire and grit are as well. The team has also been given more motivation, following tragic news.\n\nOn December 19, it was revealed that key backup forward and Miami native Marcus Allen was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. No question, it’s a devastating blow to the rotation. However, when the adversity of life has hit teams across sports, it has always brought the players closer together. Miami will be no different.\n\nThe Canes rank well in several team statistical categories. Offensively, UM is one of the most balanced and highest-scoring teams in Division 1. Nationally, they rank 17th in total points (1,163), seventh in both field goals (431) and field goal percentage (.523), sixth in assists (259), and 37th in offensive rebounds (174).\n\nLucas has installed an approach that is similar to Dean Smith, the former legendary head coach from North Carolina. There isn’t one player who takes up most of the shots. While Malik Reneau averages 13.4 shot attempts per game, Tre Donaldson, Tru Washington, and Shelton Henderson have all gotten their looks and touches.\n\nEveryone gets the ball at some point, and everyone gets to shoot. This team doesn’t depend on the three-ball and prefers to play inside-outside. They have only attempted 268 shots from beyond the arc, ranking 250th amongst all Division 1 teams.\n\nHowever, they have shot it decently, ranking 74th in three-point shooting percentage (.366). On the defensive end, the Canes have wreaked havoc on the opposition. They are 30th in the country in total rebounds (530). Opponents have only been able to shoot at 40.1 percent, which ranks 312th in the nation.\n\nOpponents have also shot a dreadful true shooting percentage of .499. UM has only allowed 880 points through the first 13 games, ranking their opponents’ scoring total at 238th in all of college basketball. Miami has accumulated 195 total turnovers, which is inside the top 40. Needless to say, this team does many things well.\n\nWhile one can look at Miami’s schedule and see a slate filled with smaller local schools, the coaches and players have laid the foundation for a potential run through the ACC this season. There are a few big issues that have popped up. The most consistent one has been the team’s inability to shoot consistently from the foul line.\n\nAs of now, Miami ranks 327th in the country, shooting at a woeful 66 percent clip from the charity stripe. The only other power conference team that is below them is Cincinnati from the Big 12 (.637). They also need to be a bit better when guarding the perimeter.\n\nOpponents are shooting 34 percent from beyond the arc against the Hurricanes. Several players, such as North Florida’s Kamrin Oriol, BYU’s Kennard Davis Jr., Georgetown’s Caleb Williams, and Bethune-Cookman’s Jakobi Heady, have all put on great shooting exhibitions against UM.\n\nStill, the team’s performance has been solid and thrilling. Each player has stood out and shone. Dunk parties have been held at the Watsco Center. Dominating outings have been enjoyed by the sparse but growing crowds during home games.\n\nThe team’s chemistry and vibes couldn’t be better. The overall position the team is in has brought lots of passion, energy, and excitement. It has been a welcome change considering how last season went. Miami opens up ACC play against the 7-6 Pitt Panthers next Tuesday at home.",

    "description": "Memories of Tennessee's 2021 appearance in the Music City Bowl brought Jalin Hyatt to Josh Heupel's mind. Here's why he thought Hyatt was relevant.",
    "fullText": "NASHVILLE – Jalin Hyatt wasn’t an obvious talking point when coach Josh Heupel addressed the Tennessee football team before Music City Bowl practice.\n\nBut memories of the Vols’ last trip to this bowl steered Heupel toward Hyatt, the 2022 Biletnikoff Award winner, as one of his favorite examples of persistence paying off for a player.\n\n“A lot of times in December you get a glimpse of where (young players) are continuing to grow,” Heupel said on Dec. 26 at Montgomery Bell Academy, where UT is holding on-site bowl practices.\n\n“Last time we were here, Jalin Hyatt was a great example. That’s a story we actually talk to our team about pretty much every single year. It’s one that I shared with our young guys.”\n\nNo. 23 Tennessee (8-4) plays Illinois (8-4) in the Music City Bowl on Dec. 30 (5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) at Nissan Stadium.\n\nFreshmen will play key roles after notable players opted out to prepare for NFL draft workouts. Heupel told them about Hyatt’s breakout Music City Bowl performance that led to stardom the following season.\n\nIn 2021, Hyatt had a disappointing sophomore season under Heupel, then UT’s first-year coach. Hyatt suffered a concussion, lost his slot receiver position, struggled in the new offense and lost his confidence.\n\nBut Hyatt kept working and finally got an opportunity in the Music City Bowl. He caught a 31-yard pass to set up a UT touchdown. And with 1:35 remaining in the game, he caught a TD pass from Hendon Hooker to send it into overtime.\n\nTennessee ultimately lost 48-45 to Purdue. But the Vols amassed 666 yards of total offense, and Hyatt proved that he was ready to step into the spotlight.\n\nIn 2022, Hyatt adopted an intense workout routine, increased his film study and caught a school-record 15 TD passes to win the Biletnikoff Award, given to the best receiver in college football. He was selected by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nIt started with his performance in the Music City Bowl.\n\n“That guy that had a little bit of an up-and-down during the course of the (2021) season,” Heupel said. “But his focus, his preparation, his work habits during the month of December were dramatically different (leading up to the Music City Bowl).\n\n“We expected him to play really well when we got here. He obviously did, and that was the springboard to his (2022) season.”\n\nHeupel said Hyatt serves as an example to players at any position. But his breakout certainly applies to UT’s situation at wide receiver.\n\nChris Brazzell, the SEC’s leading receiver, opted out of the Music City Bowl to prepare for NFL draft workouts. Freshmen Radarious Jackson and Travis Smith will replace him against Illinois.\n\nIf they play well, it could lead to a starting role in the 2026 season.\n\n“(We) expect both of them to play at a really high level,” Heupel said. “Those are guys we had a lot of trust in heading into the season based on what they had done during spring ball, their maturity, their summer prep.\n\n“Both of them got nicked up at different points during the season but finished in a great way.”\n\nJackson has seven catches for 72 yards this season, and he missed four games due to injury. Smith has three catches for 29 yards, and he missed six games due to injury.\n\nQuarterback Joey Aguilar said both freshmen have worked into the primary rotation during bowl practices. They joined Braylon Staley, the SEC Freshman of the Year, and Mike Matthews.\n\n“(Jackson and Smith) got a lot of reps at practice (during the season), but a lot of team reps and first-team reps are a little different. They’ve adapted well,” Aguilar said. “They know what they’re doing, and they’re out there competing for a spot.”\n\nThe Music City Bowl provides an opportunity for Jackson and Smith to get a headstart in the 2026 competition at wide receiver.\n\nAssuming Staley and Matthews return, one starting spot will be up for grabs. And UT would like to expand the rotation beyond three receivers.\n\nFive-star signee Tristen Keys, arguably the No. 1 receiver in the 2026 class, will enroll at Tennessee in January. Tyreek King, a four-star signee from Knox Catholic, also will join the mix.\n\nJoakim Dodson is another option after he caught two passes as a freshman this season.\n\nAdam Sparks is the Tennessee football beat reporter.

    "description": "Here is why the Los Angeles Chargers should be able to secure the win in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "The Chargers will be seeking to put some demons to rest in a rematch of the 2024 AFC Wild Card against the Texans on Saturday.\n\nHere's a few reasons to be optimistic about LA's chances to get it done.\n\nHampton has been ramping his way up into the impact player the Chargers hoped he would be when they made him their first-round selection in April, taking 16 carries for 85 yards and a touchdown last week. He has forced a missed tackle on 32.7 percent of his rushing attempts this season, the only player to hit a mark over 30 percent with at least 100 carries. Houston allows only 96.2 rushing yards per game, fourth in the league, but Hampton's ability to churn through tacklers and fight for extra yards could result in a crucial contribution from the rookie.\n\nCJ Stroud has thrown all 6 of his interceptions this season against zone coverage, compared to only three touchdowns. 13 of his touchdowns have come against man coverage, the most in the NFL without throwing an interception. Los Angeles has played zone 82.9 percent of the time this year, generating 14 of their 17 interceptions as a defense from zone looks. The Texans have struggled on offense at times this season, so getting a turnover or two to put the Chargers offense in an advantageous position could prove to be the difference on Saturday.\n\nDespite both riding win streaks into Saturday's game, these two teams have to be feeling a bit different about their recent performances. LA beat the Cowboys 34-17, their second-highest point total of the season and Justin Herbert's fourth 300-yard game of the year. Dallas scored all 17 points in the first half before the Chargers' defense shut the lights off in the second half and closed the door on the win. Houston, meanwhile, needed a Derek Stingley Jr. pick-six to sneak by the 2-13 Raiders 23-21 after allowing rookie running back Ashton Jeanty to compile 188 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns. Stroud had a lower QBR and passer rating than Geno Smith, who has struggled all season as the Raiders quarterback.\n\nHerbert has been pressured 252 times this season, more than any other quarterback in the NFL, but he managed to avoid being sacked all game against the Cowboys for the first time in nearly a year, dating back to Week 17 of 2024. Herbert leads the league in QBR (81), pass yards (1,135) and passing touchdowns (3) on plays where the defense records a pass rush win, defined by ESPN as a defeated block within 2.5 seconds. Against a Texans pass rush that has Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. in the top ten of the league leaderboard in sacks, the Chargers will need Herbert to keep that pace.\n\nPhillips now owns the Chargers' single-season record for special teams tackles with 23, which also leads the league entering Week 17. With three tackles last week, he held the Cowboys to an average starting field position of the 24.7-yard line, their lowest of the season. Houston is tied for 12th in the league in kickoff return average, but another performance like last week's from Phillips could keep the Texans tied down and force the offense to beat the streaking Chargers defense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: Chargers' path to beating the Texans: Week 17 optimism",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks will be without a couple of key pieces in their effort to stay atop the NFC against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nSeahawks head coach Mike Macdonald announced they would be without starting left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant. The Panthers’ game is the second straight game Cross will miss after suffering a hamstring injury, which might put an end to his regular season, against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nJosh Jones, a versatile offensive lineman who signed with the Seahawks in the offseason, will start in Cross’ place for the second week in a row. Jones played his first significant snaps for the Seahawks last week against the Los Angeles Rams and did not allow a sack against a hungry Rams’ pass rush.\n\nSeahawks game statuses for Week 17: \n\nOut — Coby Bryant (knee) and Charles Cross (hamstring) \n\nEveryone else is good to go.\n\n— Dugar, Michael-Shawn (@MikeDugar) December 26, 2025\n\nThe Seahawks will once again be turning toward Ty Okada for help in the secondary with the loss of Coby Bryant. Bryant suffered a knee injury that held him out of the second half of the Rams game and did not practice at all this week.\n\nOkada has been instrumental for Seattle this season, providing relief when safety Julian Love missed time in the first half of 2025. He’s totaled 58 tackles and snagged his first career interception with an immaculate catch against the Washington Commanders.\n\nThe good news for the Seahawks is that Bryant and Cross are the only starters with injury woes after receiving positive news on Riq Woolen and Nick Emmanwori earlier this week. It’s starting to feel like 2013 again as the Seahawks head to Carolina with the NFC’s No. 1 seed on the line on Sunday.",

As a rookie, he appeared in 15 games, primarily as a punt returner, averaging 8.8 yards per attempt. He also caught four passes for 80 yards.\n\nThe 24-year-old suffered a hamstring injury in the preseason and has been on injured reserve since.

    "title": "Patience, Sabres Fans – World Junior Success Doesn't Guarantee Buffalo's Prospects A Successful NHL Future",
    "description": "The Buffalo Sabres will have four players at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship. But success at the World Junior tournament offers little guarantee prospects of NHL success. While World Junior glory would be great, the Sabres' youngsters need more time and patience to develop.",
    "fullText": "In more recent seasons, the Buffalo Sabres had more players at the annual IIHF World Junior Championship tournament. But it’s a measure of how things have changed for the Sabres that, in the 2026 World Juniors, only four Buffalo youngsters are involved. The leading teams in terms of involvement at the World Juniors are the Nashville Predators and Utah Mammoth, who each have seven players playing. And given where those teams stand in their development, they should have that many players involved.\n\nBut while the Sabres will have less of a footprint on this year’s World Junior tournament, there’s still reason for Buffalo fans to tune in. Whether it’s watching Team U.S.A. players and Sabres prospects Brodie Ziemer, Adam Kleber and Luke Osburn, or Team Czechia's Radim Mrtka, the Sabres will still have plenty of players taking part in this best-on-best tourney.\n\nThe reality of where the Sabres are in competitive cycle means that they should be expecting to have fewer players at the World Juniors down the road. There’s no direct correlation between where a team is competitively speaking and the number of World Junior players they have in any one season, but for a team like Buffalo, the organization needs to be more focused on the present than on the future.\n\nThus, even if the Americans do win gold at this year’s World Juniors and put Ziemer, Osburn and Kleber in the spotlight, when the holiday break is over, none of those players (nor Mrtka) will be immediate difference-makers at the NHL level. And that will be true of the quartet regardless of how things turn out in the next week-and-a-half. The World Juniors has a long history of players who were World Junior standouts, yet who couldn’t make that translate into NHL success.\n\nIdeally, it’s true you want all of your prospects to be needle-movers at whatever level they’re at in any point of their history. But that’s not realistic, and it’s probably unfair to prospects who are still learning what type of player they can be.\n\nFor A Christmas Present, Sabres Fans Need This More Than Anything Else Fans of the Buffalo Sabres could use more than a few presents this holiday season. But there's one thing Sabres fans crave more than run-of-the-mill holiday cheer – they're seeking genuine hope.\n\nRegardless of the hype around them, young players need the time, space and understanding to evolve and grow into the best version of themselves, and that may mean arriving at a level that some observers see as a disappointment. The prospect game is hit-and-miss, and even if the Sabres have some hits when it comes to players representing their homeland, that doesn’t mean those same players won’t be misses in hockey’s best league.\n\nSo when Sabres fans tune in to see how this year’s World Juniors plays out, they have to temper their expectations. This year’s tournament will be on home ice for the Americans, but that could increase the pressure on Buffalo’s three American players. But the best way to test those players is to put their feet into the fire and see how they respond.\n\nThe Time For New Sabres GM Kekalainen To Make A Trade Or Firing Happen In Buffalo Has Already Arrived New Buffalo Sabres' GM Jarmo Kekalainen can't be preaching patience with this Sabres group. Whether it's trading a star player or firing coach Lindy Ruff, Kekalainen must shake up the organization if Buffalo is to salvage their season.\n\nIt’s going to take more patience to see how these Sabres prospects deal with expectations, but it’s their progress once the spotlight of the World Juniors ends that will ultimately reveal more about where Buffalo’s up-and-comers are going to land as professional hockey players.\n\nGlory at the World Juniors would be great, but it isn’t the be-all and end-all. And the Sabres’ growth as a team will mean more to Buffalo fans than even a gold-medal result for the U.S. would be to them.",

Heat up your Christmas leftovers, put on your new pair of cozy pajamas, and get ready for an action-packed card to play this spectacular year out.\n\nDrew McIntyre has had a less than jolly season after WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes invaded his home mere days before last week's December 19 episode of \"SmackDown.\" While McIntyre was absent from WWE programming following the home break-in and subsequent brawl, \"The Scottish Psychopath\" is back with a vengeance. With the lines between in-ring competition and out-of-ring animosity now blurred beyond recognition, just what will McIntyre do in order to get his revenge against Rhodes in this rivalry-turned-blood feud?\n\nSpeaking of feuds, The Miz is out to reclaim his honor after receiving a Ten-Knuckle Shuffle at \"Saturday Night's Main Event,\" courtesy of R-Truth and Joe Hendry! Grand Rapids will be chanting the name of the former TNA World Champion as he appears to take on the former WWE world titleholder in singles action. While this is looking to be a typical one-on-one affair, The Miz is notorious for bending the rules in order to come out with a win. Will the new-age Hendry be able to withstand the veteran Miz's underhanded tactics, or will Hendry's viral moments crumble under The Miz's tried-and-true tenacity?\n\nIn the vein of tried-and-true tenacity, United States Champion Ilja Dragunov is set to defend his title in yet another installation of his Open Challenge series. So far, he has defended his title against the likes of Tommaso Ciampa, J.D. McDonagh, both halves of Fraxiom, Carmelo Hayes, and others. Dragunov has mostly been able to steer clear of controversy and repeat challengers during his time as United States Champion, but recently defeated challengers Ciampa, Johnny Gargano, and Candace LeRae may not be done with him just yet. Who can Dragunov rely on to even the numbers, or will \"The Mad Dragon\" be faced with the impossible-to-win numbers game to end 2025?\n\nAll will be revealed when WWE's blue brand comes to life tonight, at 8PM Eastern, 7PM Central!\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Kevin Vallejos is in awe to see his name among the 15 best featherweights in the UFC.\n\nIt's not that the Argentine youngster doesn't believe in his potential, but he just didn't expect to enter the official UFC featherweight rankings in his first year with the promotion.\n\nVallejos (17-1 MMA, 3-0 UFC) made his first walk to the octagon in March and debuted with a first-round knockout win over veteran Seung Woo Choi. He followed up with two more wins, the most recent being a knockout of Giga Chidkaze earlier this month in the co-main event of UFC on ESPN 73. This streak was enough to get the 24-year-old a spot in the UFC rankings – which wasn't in his plans entering 2025.\n\n\"I'm very happy and satisfied with what I did this year,\" Vallejos told MMA Junkie in Spanish. \"It was a very complete year. It was a lot. It was a dream to start the year as a debutant and end it ranked. It's crazy. Honestly, I didn't expect this.\"\n\nVallejos' expectations were to get himself accustomed to the UFC bright lights, get a few wins and start positioning himself so he could then make a push toward the rankings in 2026.\n\n\"I was surprised to get No. 13 in the rankings. I thought I would be ranked 15th after beating Giga,\" Vallejos said. \"I sincerely was surprised to see me in the rankings because that wasn't in my plan for this year, to enter the top. I never thought about that. The plan was just to generate experience. But to get to the top so quick and be ranked 13th, it surprised me a ton.\"\n\nThe quick success proved to Vallejos that he's on the right path and beyond that, he's where he needs to be – home. Unlike many South American fighters, Vallejos has stayed with his original team rather than migrate to a bigger team in the U.S. He's very proud to be fighting out of Argentina, and 2025 just validated his stance on staying home.\n\n\"I'm at the level, and we're doing things well,\" Vallejos said when asked about his biggest lesson in 2025. \"A lot of people have to go live in another country to get the resources. I'm doing something different. I'm staying in my country, Argentina, where the country is not that well known, and we're not at the level culturally or technically like Brazil, United States or other countries. Yet, I do see we're doing well. I only leave to do camp, but I mainly stay here and continue to learn and get tools. I still have the idea of doing all my camp here. That's something I'm looking at and more this coming year. We already did something similar. I only leave (to Brazil) a month-and-a-half. I continue to think about that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC rookie surprised to enter rankings in 2025: 'It's crazy'",

    "fullText": "Amidst departures to the NCAA transfer portal and opt outs for the Citrus Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, the Texas Longhorns received some positive news for the 2026 season on Friday when junior safety Jelani McDonald announced his return for his senior campaign.\n\nAt 6’2 and 199 pounds, McDonald has prototypical size and explosiveness for the position that could allow him to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft if he stays healthy and maintains his developmental trajectory.\n\nOut of Waco Connally, McDonald was a late riser in the 2023 recruiting class, receiving his offer from the Longhorns in October when he was committed to Oklahoma State. TCU also factored into McDonald’s recruitment, hosting him for an official and unofficial visit late in the process, but it was McDonald’s time on the Forty Acres in December that ultimately sealed his decision to spurn his father’s alma mater and signed with Texas.\n\nA triple jumper, high jumper, and basketball standout at Connally, McDonald played quarterback, wide receiver, and on defense in high school, allowing him to finish the cycle as a consensus four-star prospect ranked as the No. 74 player nationally and the No. 2 athlete, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.\n\nThe athlete classification certainly fit McDonald, as it wasn’t clear whether he would grow into a linebacker in college even as he displayed the ability to play cornerback despite his height. As a freshman, McDonald m0ved between nickel back, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.\n\nWhile McDonald developed behind the scenes shuffling through positions to determine his future role, he played on three special teams units for the Horns as a true freshman, recording two tackles against Oklahoma State in the Big 12 Championship game.\n\nAs a sophomore, McDonald showed signs of becoming a rising star as he was thrust into playing time due to injuries, totaling 33 tackles, one tackle for loss, one interception, and one pass broken up with four starts over 14 games.\n\nMcDonald took another step forward as a full-time starter in 2025, leading the team in tackles with 73 (43 solo) thanks to late-season injuries sustained by redshirt senior safety Michael Taaffe and junior linebacker Anthony Hill Jr., notching four tackles for loss, three interceptions, three passes broken up, and a fumble return.\n\nWith McDonald returning, Texas has one starter back at the safety position with Taaffe exhausting his eligibility.",

Statistically, they have the worst red-zone D in the league this season.”\n\nThe Patriots are giving up a staggering 74% of touchdowns when opponents reach the red zone, making it the worst rate in the NFL.\n\nNew England will likely face a handful of powerful offenses in the postseason, and it won’t be able to compete if it doesn’t limit opposing teams to field goals.\n\nThe Patriots need to focus on improving their red zone defense over the next two weeks, especially as they face the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, both of whom will be starting backup quarterbacks.\n\nWhy NFL Writer Would’ve Loved To See Myles Garrett On Patriots This Season",

He also forced a fumble and had a pass defensed in the win. The All-Pro is tied for the team lead with four interceptions and is the only player in the NFL to have at least four interceptions in each of the past three seasons. With Sunday’s performance, he became the first player in franchise history to have a forced fumble and an interception return for a touchdown in a game.\n\nRB Omarion Hampton had 85 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries against the Cowboys, his most productive showing in three games since returning from a broken ankle. The rookie first-round pick from North Carolina has 516 yards on the ground and four total touchdowns in eight games. The Chargers will need to maintain offensive balance against the outstanding Texans defense.\n\nTexans DE Will Anderson Jr. vs. Chargers' offensive line. Improved pass protection kept QB Justin Herbert from being sacked in Dallas, which in turn allowed the offense to have one of its best performances of the season. However, the difference in quality between the Cowboys’ pass rush and what Anderson and company will bring is stark. Anderson has a career-high 11 1/2 sacks, and his 17 tackles for loss have been just as important in creating obvious passing downs. He has a tackle for loss in 10 of the past 11 games and all seven road games this season.\n\nTexans: RB Woody Marks and LB Azeez Al-Shaair are set to return after missing last week’s game with injuries. … LT Aireontae Ersery is listed as questionable and could miss the game with a thumb injury. … RT Trent Brown (ankle/knee) will not play.\n\nChargers: LT Jamaree Salyer (hamstring), return specialist Derius Davis (ankle), CB Benjamin St-Juste (shoulder) and rookie S R.J. Mickens (shoulder) have all been ruled out. … DL Teair Tart (groin) and RG Mekhi Becton (knee) are questionable. The Chargers estimated Becton would have been a full participant if they had practiced Thursday, which bodes better for his availability.\n\nThe Chargers won the most recent meeting in the regular season, leaving Houston with a 34-24 triumph on Oct. 2, 2022. … The Texans are facing the Chargers at SoFi Stadium for the first time. They came up with a 27-20 victory in September 2019 in their only other trip to Los Angeles since the Chargers left San Diego in 2017.\n\nThe Texans can clinch a playoff berth with a win or tie, or a loss or tie by the Colts. … Houston’s seven-game winning streak is the longest active streak in the NFL and tied for the second longest in franchise history behind a nine-game winning streak in 2018. … DeMeco Ryans is the first head coach in franchise history to win 10 games in three consecutive seasons. … Houston’s defense leads the NFL in yards (272.3) and points (16.6) allowed. … QB C.J. Stroud has had at least 200 yards passing in five straight road games. … RB Nick Chubb had 42 yards of offense last week and had 170 yards of offense and a touchdown in his only career game against the Chargers in 2021 while with Cleveland. … WR Nico Collins had 59 yards receiving last week for his eighth straight game with at least 55 yards receiving. He had seven catches for 122 yards and a touchdown in a playoff win over the Chargers last season. … The Chargers have won 11 games in consecutive seasons for the third time in franchise history (1979-80, 2006-07). … Jim Harbaugh is one of eight NFL head coaches to have multiple 11-win seasons with two different organizations. … The Chargers defense has 13 takeaways (three fumbles, 10 interceptions) in its past six games after getting eight through its first nine games. … Justin Herbert threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns against the Cowboys, his third game this season with multiple touchdowns passes and no interceptions. … WR Ladd McConkey needs two receptions to pass Keenan Allen (148) for most in Chargers history through a player’s first two seasons. … OLB Tuli Tuipulotu got his 13th sack of the season versus the Cowboys. He can become the fifth player in Chargers history with 14 or more in a season (Khalil Mack, Shawne Merriman, Leslie O’Neal, Lee Williams). … S Derwin James Jr. needs one sack to become the third player in NFL history with 600 tackles, 20 sacks and 10 interceptions in his first 100 games (Roquan Smith, Karlos Dansby).\n\nFacing two of the strongest rush defenses in the league, neither Omarion Hampton nor Woody Marks is likely to put up big numbers on the ground. Desperate fantasy owners with limited options will have to gamble that either tailback could make up for it as outlets in the passing game, as Marks was a tremendous receiver in college and Hampton has displayed good hands in his first season.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Despite a three-game win streak going into the Christmas break, the Florida Gators continue to drop in the ESPN College Basketball Power Index.\n\nLast ranked No. 11 following a win over George Washington, Florida fell one spot to No. 12 after decisive wins over Saint Francis and Colgate — both considered Quadrant 4 matchups by the NET rankings.\n\nThe Gators have a 19.0 overall BPI, up from 18.5 on Dec. 16. The offense improved to 8.8 (20th) from 8.0 (24th), while the Florida defense dipped to 10.2 (T-10th) from 10.3 (8th) in that time. ESPN projects Florida to go 21.5-9.5 overall — a 0.5-game increase — and 12.5-5.5 in conference play, a 0.4-game improvement.\n\n“The College Basketball Power Index (BPI) is a measure of team strength that is meant to be the best predictor of performance going forward,” ESPN explains. “BPI represents how many points above or below average a team is. Strength of Record (SOR) is a measure of team accomplishment based on how difficult a team’s W-L record is to achieve. Game predictions account for opponent strength, pace of play, site, travel distance, day’s rest and altitude, and are used to simulate the season 10,000 times to produce season projections.”\n\nFlorida remains the favorite to win the SEC, with 41% odds — up from 38.2% chance last week. The Vanderbilt Commodores (29%) and Tennessee Volunteers (21.3%) have the next best odds to win the conference, followed by Alabama Crimson Tide (15%) and Kentucky (14%). No other SEC team has better than a 4.4% chance to win the conference.\n\nFlorida's remaining strength of schedule is now 24th in the country, up from 44th before a three-game stretch against Quadrant 4 opponents. Florida still has Dartmouth on the schedule, and then it's all SEC from there. The Gators' strength of schedule (to date) ranks fifth in the country, while the non-conference slate ranks sixth nationally.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators basketball ESPN BPI rankings Dec. 26",

    "fullText": "After two big deals, the pitching trade market recalibrated originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHeading into the winter, Edward Cabrerawas one of the hottest names on the trade market. The Miami Marlins right-hander was widely viewed as the most likely rotation piece to move as the club looked to stockpile prospects during its rebuild.\n\nThat picture has shifted. And it may have happened faster than expected.\n\nAccording to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald, both the Houston Astros and Baltimore Orioles are no longer pursuing Cabrera. The change appears less about the pitcher’s value and more about how quickly the starting pitching market recalibrated after the Baltimore Orioles made their move for Shane Baz.\n\nBaltimore had been linked to nearly every high-end starter available this offseason, both in free agency and on the trade market. That list included Cabrera, who fit the profile of a young, controllable arm with upside. The Orioles addressed that need last week by sending multiple prospects and a draft pick to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for Baz, a deal that provided immediate rotation help but also consumed significant prospect capital. Once that trade was completed, a second major trade for another high-upside starter became far less realistic.\n\nHouston followed a similar path.\n\nThe Astros entered the offseason with their rotation in flux after a wave of injuries in 2025, including Tommy John surgeries for Ronel Blanco, Hayden Wesneski and Brandon Walter, along with another elbow setback for Luis Garcia. With Framber Valdez nearing free agency, Houston moved aggressively to add a controllable arm, acquiring Mike Burrows in a three-team deal headlined by Brandon Lowe.\n\nThat move came at a cost. Outfielder Jacob Melton, one of Houston’s top prospects, and right-hander Anderson Brito were sent to Tampa Bay as part of the deal, for an organization that has traded heavily in recent years, parting with that level of talent likely reduced its ability to assemble another premium package for Cabrera.\n\nThe Marlins, meanwhile, have little incentive to rush. After years of flashes interrupted by injuries, Cabrera delivered his most complete season in 2025, posting a 3.53 ERA across a career-high 137 2/3 innings. He maintained a 25.8 percent strikeout rate while trimming his walk rate into single digits for the first time. A brief return from a September elbow sprain in the final week of the season helped ease some health concerns heading into 2026.\n\nCabrera remains under team control through 2028 and is projected to earn $3.7 million in arbitration. Miami has been clear it does not want to sell short, and with two aggressive suitors having already spent significant prospect capital, patience is now a viable strategy.",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce addressed retirement speculation following the Kansas City Chiefs' Christmas night defeat to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos won 20-13 over the Chiefs Thursday night at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Kelce, who played alongside third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun while starter Patrick Mahomes and backup Gardner Minshew were out with knee injuries, had five catches for 36 yards against the Broncos.\n\nTaylor Swift reads aloud a love letter from Travis Kelce in new docuseries: What it says\n\nThe Chiefs' loss comes amid talks about whether Kelce will announce if he is retiring or not after the season. He sparked rumors about a possible retirement in a pre-game interview with former NFL star Tony Gonzalez on Prime Video.\n\nIn the interview, Kelce said he feels motivated about his future but that he \"has to make the right decision for me.\"\n\n\"I got to hope that if I do want to come back, the Chiefs are willing to bring me back, so it's a two-way street on that,\" he said. \"But at the same time, at this point in this year, I'm just trying to finish out and give Chiefs Kingdom everything I got and go out there and do it with some of that flair.\"\n\nHe added that his brother, Jason Kelce, who retired from the NFL in 2024 after 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, is one of several people he's spoken to about the question of retirement.\n\n\"I'm asking myself, what was it for you that helped you find that answer?\" Kelce said.\n\nGonzalez, who retired from the NFL in 2013, replied with his reasons leading up to his retirement and told Kelce that he is \"one of the greatest tight ends of all time.\n\n\"You have won Super Bowl rings, you have been all pro, you have done stuff off the field, you have stuff waiting for you after the season's over -- the sky's the limit on what your next chapter is going to be,\" he said.\n\nIn a post-game press conference shared by KMBC-TV on YouTube, Kelce reflected on Thursday's game and said there were \"a whole lot of emotions.\"\n\n\"You've got everybody in the world watching you,\" he said. \"You get to go out there with the young guys on prime-time television. Young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life is like.\"\n\nWhen asked what was going through his head in what could have been his last game at Arrowhead stadium he talked about the fans that have supported him and the Chiefs.\n\n\"You only get a few of those moments where you just get to stand there and appreciate 60- to 70,000 Chiefs fans screaming for you.\"\n\nTaylor Swift wears engagement ring while cheering on Travis Kelce's college team\n\n\"I always embrace that moment, it's fun and hopefully I got everybody fired up for it,\" he added.\n\nIn terms of retirement, he said, \"I'll let that be a decision I'll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes.\"\n\nKelce's teammate Chris Jones, defensive tackle for the Chiefs, said in a separate post-game interview shared on YouTube by KMBC-TV that he hopes Thursday's game wasn't his last with Kelce.\n\n\"We just have been through so much together,\" he said. \"He's been like a brother. I hope he gives it one more year. Just one more, man. Just one more.\"\n\nESPN said that Kelce's fiancé Taylor Swift was in a stadium suite cheering him on. His teammates Mahomes and Minshew were also there to show their support.",

    "title": "'We suffered together' - Amorim changes style as Man Utd win",
    "description": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was rewarded for a change in style and formation with a hard-fought win over Newcastle in the Premier League.",
    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe headed back to the north-east of England reflecting on yet another disappointing away performance. He admitted his side failed to turn their territorial advantage into the type and volume of meaningful chances that would have earned maximum points.\n\nBut for the home side, the outcome felt significant.\n\nLisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are at other ends of the experience scale.\n\nOne is a World Cup winner, albeit one just returning from the latest in a sequence of bad injuries. The other is a 19-year-old with 15 senior appearances under his belt – who has now extended the longest playing sequence of his first-team career to five games.\n\nPaired together in the middle of a revised back four, with Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot as full-backs and Dorgu switched to the right side of Amorim's attack, Martinez and Heaven were immense.\n\n\"He [Martinez] is a guy with a lot of character,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"He is really good on the ball - and has won a World Cup, so he is used to that stress - but he showed today he is a top player.\n\n\"He is a small guy but today he did well against a team with tall players.\"\n\nThe sight of 5ft 9in Martinez leaping high to win a header against 6ft 6in Nick Woltemade in the first half was impressive.\n\nEven though there was an element of Amorim having to protect a player starting for the first time since February following his recovery from cruciate knee ligament surgery, there must have been concern when Martinez left the field two minutes from time and 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson came on in his place.\n\nFredricson did his job well. But he had Heaven with him to bring more solidity.\n\nIt is hard to believe when the former Arsenal youngster started against West Ham on 4 December, he was booked almost immediately and looked so shaky, it was almost a shock he lasted until half-time when he was replaced by Leny Yoro.\n\nIn the space of five games and three weeks, Heaven has advanced rapidly.\n\nHe was excellent in the defeat at Aston Villa on 21 December and followed that up with a performance of maturity against Newcastle that earned him the host broadcaster's man-of-the-match award.\n\nSo good has Heaven been that Amorim is warning Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, currently sidelined, they can't be certain of getting their places back when they are fit again.\n\nThat is significant in two ways. Firstly, De Ligt was, by common consent, United's best defender until a back injury ruled him out of the West Ham game. Maguire, meanwhile, is still waiting to learn whether United will offer him a new contract when his current one expires in the summer.\n\n\"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He trained really well, which shows if you train well, it can help you play.\n\n\"If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe just made co-driver round the world proud with his performance at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France.",
    "fullText": "It takes a special kind of person to willingly strap oneself into a hatchback aimed at flying through the woods at high speeds. Rally drivers are madmen full-stop, but their shotgun-riding co-drivers are a whole different breed. Don’t discount the amount of driving know-how tucked away in those high-flying passenger seats, however. Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe recently took the wheel of a Hyundai i20 N Rally2 at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France, making fellow co-drivers round the world beam with pride.\n\nWhile you might not be familiar with Martijn Wydaeghe, you have likely heard of his teammate Thierry Neuville. The two have been driving together since the 2021 season, with Wydaeghe co-driving during Neuville’s 2024 WRC Driver’s Championship effort. This year wasn’t as successful for last year’s champs, with Neuville finishing 5th overall in the standings. The results were largely tempered by two consecutive retirements at the Central Europe and Japan rallies towards the end of the season. The pair came back to win the final event of the year at Rally Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile the automaker didn’t put Wydaeghe out in the proper Rally1 machine he’s used to riding in, the Belgian driver made his driving debut in the production-based Rally2 machine. He did previously get a go in the Rally1 car at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed, however. I’m sure the co-driver-turned-wheelman wasn’t too upset about the more approachable platform for his first go either.\n\nWith co-driver Florian Haut-Labourdette alongside, Wydaeghe pushed the IXO-sponsored Hyundai through the 25-mile rally. His pace was undeniable, with Wydaeghe managing to take home a stage win on his very first attempt. The pair only managed to muster sixth place overall, but fans were more than happy to see Wydaeghe give it a shot. That said, I don’t think Neuville needs to be too worried about job security for the time being. Perhaps the WRC should look at a co-driver shootout event moving forward, though.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "Hello and welcome back to the Friday Feedbag where I will never serve you slop. This week is weird! It’s a Friday today and also day after Christmas, so many are either not working at all or have had the last one to two days off. To anyone who had to work both Christmas Eve and Christmas, you are the real MVP and I salute you. But, today feels like one of those “unearned” Fridays and so I’m reminded that many refer to the week between Christmas and New Year’s as a “liminal space.” A liminal space is a place or state of transition. It can be a physical place, like an airport, or a psychological/metaphorical place.\n\nThis being a Mariners blog, we’re gonna talk about Mariners Liminal Spaces. I’ll throw out a few and then y’all can have at it in the comments.\n\nThe Stadium Light Rail Station: An obvious pick, but it is a literal place of comings and goings, usually frantic at both the arrival at the game and during the exiting. But, if you’ve ever worked at the stadium and had to catch a lonely train home long after most of the crowd had gone home, you’ve probably spent more time here in this liminal space than you’d like, waiting for a train that should have been here 10 minutes ago and maybe never ends up coming.\n\nThe Left Field Gates at T-Mobile Park: Probably the entrance I have used most in my life and yet have never spent more than a passing few moments in after getting through security and then going up those iconic stairs to the main level concourse, or straight to the elevators to the 300 level (the elevators being another great liminal space!)\n\nThe 2021 Mariners season: The last season of the drought. They almost ended it that year, or came close like in 2014, 2016, and 2018 (well….kinda), but the momentum for the 2022 playoff run arguably started in August and September 2021. The 2021 season deserves its flowers for being a wildly fun year at the ballpark while many were still emerging from the pandemic and figuring out how to live in public again.\n\nOkay, let’s hear about your favorite or least favorite Mariners liminal spaces and have a great, if unearned for some, weekend!",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBefore the NBA Cup tournament semifinals, the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder were 24-1 and had many fans and experts believing they could break the regular-season record for wins, set by the Golden State Warriors in 2016.\n\nHowever, after losing to the San Antonio Spurs for the third time this season on Christmas Day, the conversation has quickly shifted, as the Thunder have struggled to contain the young star power. San Antonio has been led by the 7'5\" French superstar Victor Wembanyama, who has gotten the best of OKC's seven-footer, Chet Holmgren, in the three matchups.\n\nOn Friday, ESPN NBA analyst Kendrick Perkins let it be known how he feels about the difference in play between the two giants.\n\nMore: Spurs record vs. Thunder: San Antonio extends winning streak over OKC with blowout victory on Christmas Day\n\n\"I gotta get on Chet (Holmgren) for a minute.

Holmgren has averaged only 11.1 points per game, 7.3 rebounds, and one assist.\n\nWembanyama, on the other hand, has nearly averaged 20 points per game with 17.7, while grabbing 8.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists, while also disrupting the rhythm of SGA and the Thunder on defense.\n\nSteve Kerr admits the Warriors are a 'fading dynasty' amidst all the team's struggles\n\nVictor Wembanyama-Thunder beef, explained: Why Spurs star's 'ethical basketball' comments caused stir\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues\n\nSan Antonio's balanced attack is turning heads during win streak\n\nAnthony Davis injury update is bad news for Dallas Mavericks on Christmas",

    "fullText": "Indiana Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton has been shooting with his teammates prior to recent games as he recovers from a torn Achilles tendon. He has provided updates on social media and in podcasts about his recovery but this is the latest public glimpse of his recovery.\n\nHaliburton is scheduled to miss the 2025-26 season after suffering a torn Achilles tendon in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder.\n\nDespite dealing with a right calf issue for a while, Tyrese Haliburton scored 9 points in the opening minutes of Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder on June 22, 2025. He made a move toward the basket with about 5 minutes to go in the first quarter and fell to the court with a torn Achilles tendon. The Pacers lost 103-91.\n\nA torn Achilles often requires an 8- to 10-month recovery. The Pacers said on July 7 that Haliburton would miss the 2025-26 season.\n\nDustin Dopirak covers the Pacers all season.

    "fullText": "NBA insider reveals that trades are incoming in LA. Who could be on their way out? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are in absolutely putrid shape as of right now. They are 4-6 in the month of December and just got the brakes beaten off of them by the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day.\n\nFollowing the loss due to the same factors that have plagued this group for a month, JJ Redick ripped the team in their postgame press conference.\n\nMore: Lakers coach JJ Redick shreds team after Rockets loss\n\nRedick stated that there are too many players on the current roster who just don't care. If you look at the teams' performances as of late, Redick is not wrong.\n\nIf this team wants to not waste a single year of Luka Dončić's prime, changes need to be made and fast because, as presently constructed, this is not a championship-caliber roster.\n\nNBA insider Kevin O'Connor reported after the game that changes to the roster could be right on the horizon in LA.\n\nAfter the Rockets blew out the Lakers at home, Kevin O'Connor got on Twitter/X and laid out exactly what the plan is in LA after their abysmal showing through the month of December.\n\nTrades are coming in Los Angeles. Just a matter of who and when. Without them, this team has no chance of winning a title this year. That much is obvious after watching the Lakers as of late and listening to what JJ Redick said postgame.\n\n— Kevin O'Connor (@KevinOConnor) December 26, 2025\n\nThis leads you to think, if trades are incoming, who's on the way out the door?\n\nThere are many players on the roster not carrying their weight. Players that come to mind would quickly be players like Rui Hachimura, Jake LaRavia, Dalton Knecht, Maxi Kleber, and Gabe Vincent.\n\nAll of those players combined take up just north of $50 million in cap space. That is far too much money to go towards what is now essentially dead weight.\n\nWhile the Lakers don't have anywhere near the assets a team like OKC does, they are not without them completely. Between a mix of all those players' tradeable salaries and the picks the Lakers have to give, we could definitely see a move soon.\n\nDon't be shocked to see any or all of those players gone within the next month, as the Lakers have to take a real look in the mirror prior to the deadline.\n\nThe only issue for Los Angeles: teams know they're desperate, and as everyone knows, there's always going to be a Laker tax. We'll see if and how the team is able to improve its roster before the trade deadline.\n\nReport: Lakers 'circling back' on Heat's Andrew Wiggins\n\nWhat's behind the NBA's best bromance between Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves?\n\nLakers' Luka Doncic says he grew up idolizing this NBA legend\n\nLakers' LeBron James had alarming stat in Rockets loss",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen is sometimes the boss, other times the mediator, and always a participant in the important discussions at the club.\n\nWith Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeneß still playing prominent roles at the club on the supervisory board, Dreesen has been witness to sparks flying. When asked about Rummenigge recent statement of “FC Bayern doesn’t need less, but more Uli Hoeneß,” Dreesen could only concur.\n\n“Karl-Heinz and Uli are part of our supervisory board. We would be remiss if we didn’t seek their opinions and engage with them. I think other clubs envy us for their capacity. We have intensive exchanges, especially during transfer periods. Uli has strong opinions, and people can rally behind strong opinions. That’s part of what we do; it raises FC Bayern’s profile,” Dreesen told Welt am Sonntag (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “Being on the board of FC Bayern is a wonderful and simultaneously challenging job. It’s perfectly normal and even necessary that there are different perspectives within a club. We’re all working together to achieve the best result for FC Bayern. That means we sometimes have different opinions, and we don’t always embrace each other from the start.”\n\nSome executive might be intimidated by two big players like Hoeneß and Rummenigge still having such big voices, but Dreesen seems happy to just roll with the punches. As you can probably tell, he like has had a lot of practice in dealing with just that.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

    "fullText": "The New Orleans Saints regrouped on Friday for their final practice of the week after being given the day off on Christmas Day, and with it came the team's final Week 17 injury report. Four Saints players have been ruled out for Sunday's road game with the Tennessee Titans and three others are questionable to play. Here's what we know.\n\nDefensive tackle Bryan Bresee (knee), running back Alvin Kamara (knee/ankle), tight end Zaire Mitchell-Paden (knee), and right guard Cesar Ruiz (ankle) have all been preemptively ruled out. Veteran tight end Foster Moreau (knee) was placed on injured reserve with rookie backup Moliki Matavao coming up from the practice squad to replace him.\n\nAdditionally, a trio of wide receivers Chris Olave (back) and Mason Tipton (groin) plus kicker Charlie Smyth (illness) are questionable. Saints head coach Kellen Moore was optimistic about Olave's status and doesn't anticipate any restrictions for him on Sunday. Smyth's status is worth monitoring as the Saints don't have a backup kicker on the roster.\n\nFour other Saints players will be available on Sunday after being listed on the injury report this week. That group includes veteran defensive tackles Davon Godchaux (rest) and Nathan Shepherd (ankle/knee), swing tackle Asim Richards (ankle), and starting quarterback Tyler Shough (hip).\n\nWhat about the Titans? They already ruled out cornerback Marcus Harris (knee) plus outside linebacker Oluwafemi Oladejo (fibula) and wide receiver Bryce Oliver (knee), both of whom are on injured reserve. Another outside linebacker on IR, Ali Gaye (knee), is questionable to play after practicing fully this week. Cornerback Micah Robinson (illness) is also questionable. But the other seven players listed on the injury report are expected to be available when teams begin to warm up Sunday morning in Tennessee.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Good news, bad news from Saints final injury report in Week 17",

    "fullText": "At this point, it's undeniable — the Oklahoma City Thunder have a San Antonio Spurs problem. With everybody watching from home, the reigning NBA champion stomached through a 117-102 loss to the same team for the third time in two weeks.\n\nThat's never happened before with this group. It's pretty unprecedented to see the Thunder lose three in a row against the same squad. For the first time since last season, OKC has gone from a win machine that's unbeatable at home to a vulnerable team that's looked a step slow.\n\nNo matter what happens for the rest of the regular season, the Thunder will have this stretch hover over their heads. Anytime you want to say they'll go back-to-back, the Spurs will be most folks' counterpoint. Much like OKC two seasons ago, San Antonio looks like a team ready to compete for a title right now.\n\nAfter the signature win, Victor Wembanyama talked about how the Spurs have solved the Thunder. The 21-year-old is universally seen as a top-five player when healthy. What should scare OKC is that he's played in a limited role off the bench. It's been the rest of San Antonio that has stepped up. From De'Aaron Fox to Stephon Castle to Keldon Johnson.\n\n\"Definitely learned a lot. This is like a playoff series. We've played them three times in 12 days. We learned a lot on the tactical side,\" Wembanyama said. \"I don't want to say too much about it. Keep something for us.\"\n\nRegardless of whatever basketball secrets Wembanyama is pocketing, the Spurs' roster is perfectly built to counter OKC's league-best defense. They have several ball-handlers who can slash through their defenders and get to the rim with ease. They have the perfect mix of speed, size and athleticism.\n\nOne possession, Castle is out-muscling Williams on his way to an and-one layup. Next possession, Wembanyama is forcing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to second-guess himself on his drives to the basket.\n\nWe'll see what a potential NBA playoff series could look like. If you've followed the NBA long enough, you should know that what happens in December and in April/May are two completely different beasts. The Thunder have the track record to back up their basketball style results in rings. The Spurs aren't there yet.\n\nUntil then, though, the Thunder have seen their first real challenger step up that could prevent them from going back-to-back. Don't expect Wembanyama and the Spurs to go anywhere for the foreseeable future, either.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Victor Wembanyama won't reveal secrets to how Spurs beat Thunder",

Landman, who leads the team with 123 tackles and has forced four fumbles, has been a revelation for the Rams adding range and instincts at a position they have tended not to value. Landman, who played for Atlanta in 2022-24, will be important in trying to corral Falcons RB Bijan Robinson as both a runner and receiver.\n\nRobinson leads the NFL with 131.5 scrimmage yards per game. He needs 151 scrimmage yards to break William Andrews’ team record of 2,176 set in 1983. Robinson has at least 100 combined rushing and receiving yards in 10 games this season.\n\nRams WR Puka Nacua will be a difficult matchup against a short-handed Falcons secondary. Atlanta CB Mike Hughes is expected to miss his second consecutive game with an ankle sprain, leaving undrafted rookie Cobee Bryant and backup C.J. Henderson to work with starter A.J. Terrell. Henderson was signed from the practice squad last week and had a game-saving interception at Arizona. Nacua leads the NFL with 114 catches for 1,592 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nRams:: WR Davante Adams (hamstring) and RG Kevin Dotson (ankle) could be held out as the Rams will prioritize making sure both key players are ready for the playoffs. … S Quentin Lake (elbow) will return to practice next week and could be available for the regular-season finale against the Cardinals. … CB Roger McCreary is expected to play this week after sustaining a groin injury in his Rams’ debut Nov. 23 that led to a stint on injured reserve.\n\nFalcons: Hughes was declared unlikely to return this week by coach Raheem Morris and is expected to miss his second consecutive game. ... WR Drake London (knee) was limited in practice. London returned against Arizona after missing four games. He briefly left the game against the Cardinals after appearing to aggravate the injury but Morris expressed confidence in London's status this week. CB Clark Phillips III (triceps, illness) was designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rams have won the past two regular-season games against the Falcons, scoring at least 31 points in both games. … The Falcons ended Rams coach Sean McVay’s first season with a 26-13 victory in the NFC wild-card round in January 2018. … Atlanta has won both postseason matchups in this series, which goes back to 1966.\n\nRams QB Matthew Stafford needs two touchdown passes in his last two games to set a single-season career high. He had 41 scoring throws in 2011 with the Detroit Lions and again in 2021 with Los Angeles. … Stafford leads the NFL with 40 TD passes with only five interceptions. ... The Rams have scored 30 points in three straight games for the first time since 2018, when they did it in four straight. … Nacua had a career-high 225 yards receiving in the loss to the Seahawks. It was his third straight game with over 100 yards and sixth of the season. … The previous time the Rams led the league in scoring was in McVay’s first season as head coach in 2017. They have done it six times since the AFL-NFL merger. … TE Colby Parkinson has six touchdown receptions this season and needs one more to set the Rams’ single-season record at the position. … DL Kobie Turner got his first career interception against the Seahawks. Turner needs 2 1/2 sacks in his last two games to set a career high; he had nine sacks as a rookie in 2023. … Morris was the Rams defensive coordinator from 2021-23. ... Atlanta assistant coaches who previously worked on McVay's staff in Los Angeles: offensive coordinator Zac Robinson (2019-23), pass game specialist/game management Tim Berbenich (2023), offensive assistant K.J. Black (2022-23), assistant offensive line coach Nick Jones (2021-23) and director player performance John Griffin (2021-23). ... The Falcons rank second in the league with 50 sacks, five away from their team record of 55 set in 1997. ... Three of the Falcons' six wins came in prime-time games against Minnesota, Buffalo and Tampa Bay.

    "fullText": "The Classic at Damien has another loaded field and the Platinum Division bracket headlines the end-of-year festivities in La Verne, Calif.\n\nThere’s never any shortage of exciting finishes at the event. Crean Lutheran (Calif.) pulled off an impressive 62-59 victory against Owyhee (Idaho), putting together a huge second half to erase what was once a 17-point deficit.\n\nOwyhee notched 18 points in each of the first two quarters on Friday to build a 36-26 lead at halftime. The Storm came out hot, going 8-14 from the floor in the first quarter. Senior point guard Logan Haustveit has been the primary weapon and he finished with a team-high 18 points on 6-16 shooting.\n\nThe Saints recovered well from the slow start and hung with Owhyee heading into the break. They then flipped the script in the third quarter.\n\nJust six Crean Lutheran players scored on Friday, and it was Hunter Caplan that led the charge. He dropped 20 points on 5-13 shooting, knocking down a trio of 3-pointers. Senior center Chadrack Mpoyi was right behind with 15 points of his own. The Minnesota commit led the team with seven field goals and he also added four rebounds.\n\nDown by just a point heading into the fourth, the Saints kept chugging and led by as many as five with just over four minutes to go in regulation. Owhyee had a couple of last gasps, but Lutheran didn’t relinquish the momentum and hung on for the win to continue on in the winner’s bracket.\n\nSaints senior guard Nick Giarrusso played nearly 30 minutes and poured in 13 points to go with a game-high seven rebounds and five assists. He finished +13, the best of anyone on the court. Lutheran shot nearly 49 percent from the floor in the comeback win.\n\nBehind Haustveit, Owyhee also got 12 points from senior Canaan Magness. The Storm got 18 points from its bench, while Crean Lutheran had just two. Owyhee led for over 17 minutes of game time, but will now look to get back on track in the consolation bracket. It will face the loser of Friday night’s game between Centennial (Calif.) and Sandra Day O’Connor (Ariz.) on Saturday.\n\nCrean Lutheran will take on the winner. The Saints are the No. 18 team in California, according to the Massey Ratings. Owyhee remains the No. 1 team in Idaho.\n\nFor high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "The new Spartans and Wolverines head coaches have battled before, with one of them leading their team to a massive second half comeback",
    "fullText": "A new coaching rivalry in the state of Michigan has been born. But next year's battle for the Paul Bunyan trophy won't be the first time these new Michigan and Michigan State head coaches have met on the field.\n\nAs we all know by now, Michigan State football will have a new head coach next season with Pat Fitzgerald taking over the Spartans. And now, we know who will be leading the rival Wolverines next year: former Utah coach Kyle Whittingham. News broke on Friday that Whittingham would be named the next Michigan head coach, with the longtime Utes head man expected to sign a five-year deal with Michigan.\n\nSo, like we saw just two years ago with Jonathan Smith and Sherrone Moore, next fall's matchup between the Spartans and Wolverines will feature two new head coaches to the rivalry. But this will actually be the second time that Fitzgerald and Whittingham squared off in a game, which Fitzgerald came out with the victory.\n\nFitzgerald led Northwestern to a Holiday Bowl comeback victory over Whittingham's Utes in 2018. The Wildcats were able to overcome a 17-point halftime deficit to stun Utah and earn the Holiday Bowl victory. That was the lone meeting between these two longtime head coaches, but obviously will not be the last moving forward.\n\nFitzgerald's halftime speech that helped spark the comeback in the 2018 Holiday Bowl circulated on social media on Friday shortly after the news of Whittingham heading to Michigan. You can check out that video in the social media post below:\n\nInside the halftime speech from Pat Fitzgerald in the 2018 Holiday Bowl win for Northwestern.\n\n“One stop, one score, one stop, one score, now here we go.”\n\nNU defeated Utah 31-20 and forced five second half turnovers after trailing 20-3 at halftime of the game.\n\nVia @NU_Sports pic.twitter.com/95ceeIhcdP\n\n— Kenny Jordan (@Kenny_Jordan5) December 26, 2025\n\nUltimately, Fitzgerald's record against Whittingham from their previous stops means nothing in the future of the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry. Just like how Fitzgerald's abysmal record against the Wolverines while coaching Northwestern is also meaningless. But, nonetheless, it's still a fun little nugget to keep in mind as we dive into the next chapter of the Spartans-Wolverines rivalry.\n\nThe date for next year's Michigan-Michigan State game has not yet been announced but it should once again be a high-energy and fun matchup. Hopefully, Michigan State can come out on top and pick up their first victory over the Wolverines since Kenneth Walker III stole the show in 2021.\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "Why Michigan hired Kyle Whittingham over Kalen DeBoer, other options after Sherrone Moore firing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMichigan was put in a tough spot when revelations of an improper relationship forced the exit of coach Sherrone Moore after the coaching carousel had largely come to a stop.\n\nWhile the Wolverines made it clear they planned to conduct a full search to try to reset the program, doing so in mid-to-late December comes with fewer replacement options and a very small window to make a hire.\n\nMichigan's search reached a conclusion on Friday, and the result was a coach many believed was retired. The Wolverines agreed to hire former Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, who stepped down after 21 seasons at the helm of the Utes on Dec. 12.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Michigan's decision to hire Whittingham after Moore's unexpected firing.\n\nMORE:Sherrone Moore charges, explained\n\nIn many ways, Whittingham can be viewed as a stopgap option. He is in his late 60s and at least weighed retirement in recent years. That could be exactly what Michigan was looking for, despite its prestige and championship expectations.\n\nInterim coach Biff Poggi told reporters after Moore's firing and arrest that the program has been a \"malfunctioning organization\" for five years and required a \"massive self-examination.\" Whittingham may be year-to-year at Michigan at his age, but after running a mostly clean program at Utah for more than two decades and winning plenty of games while doing so, he might be the ideal candidate to reset the Wolverines.\n\nWhittingham said he had anticipated retiring after the 2024 season but wanted to return for at least one more run because of a disappointing finish. As expected, Whittingham stepped down after going 10-2 this past season, but he didn't label the decision a retirement, telling reporters recently that he was \"in the transfer portal.\"\n\nWhether Whittingham envisioned becoming the next head coach at Michigan or not, the Wolverines are giving him the chance to steady the ship and finish his coaching career at a premier program after more than two decades of winning at Utah.\n\nHere's a look at some of the other candidates Michigan considered:\n\nReports tied Michigan to Louisville coach Jeff Brohm in recent days, and Brohm unintentionally fed into the rumors when he told reporters, \"I don't speak on other jobs,\" after the Cardinals' Boca Raton Bowl win over Toledo.\n\nBrohm, who had success at Purdue before returning to his alma mater three years ago, was \"directly contacted\" by Michigan, 247 Sports reported.\n\nMORE: Who are the highest-paid coaches in college football?\n\nAlabama coach Kaleb DeBoer was one of the earliest targets of Michigan's search as some wondered whether Ann Arbor might be a better fit for Nick Saban's successor, but the Crimson Tide's playoff win over Oklahoma delayed the timeline of a potential exit, and DeBoer himself quelled rumors by telling reports he had \"no plans of talking with anyone\" at Michigan.\n\nArizona State coach Kenny Dillingham was reported as a potential candidate for Michigan, but he agreed to a new contract extension with the Sun Devils after the Wolverines job opened up and told reporters he never received a formal offer from Michigan.\n\nMORE:Michigan's timeline of trouble since Jim Harbaugh hiring\n\nWhittingham agreed to a five-year contract, ESPN's Pete Thamel reported, with the deal worth $8.2 million annually.\n\nWhittingham is set to make $8 million in 2026, and the contract is 75 percent guaranteed.\n\nWhile Whittingham may be viewed as a stopgap option after the Moore scandal, the five-year deal indicates Michigan at least plans to move forward with the veteran coach for more than one or two seasons.\n\nWhittingham turned 66 in November, making him one of the oldest FBS head coaches.\n\nA BYU graduate who got his coaching start as a graduate assistant with the Cougars, Whittingham spent a whopping 32 seasons at Utah. He started his Utes tenure as defensive line coach in 1994 before taking over as defensive coordinator in 1995. Urban Meyer retained Whittingham when he took over the program in 2003, and Whittingham took the reins after Meyer's departure for Florida at the end of the 2004 season.\n\nWhittingham said he strongly considered retiring after the 2024 season but \"couldn't step away on that note,\" referencing a disappointing 5-7 season. After a 10-win campaign in 2025, Whittingham stepped away as many expected.\n\n\"The time is right to step down from my position as the head football coach at the University of Utah,\" he said in a statement, offering few details.\n\nWhile many initially believed Whittingham was retiring, reports indicated he planned to keep his options open, and the veteran coach himself later said he was \"in the transfer portal.\"\n\nWhittingham may have simply viewed this juncture as the right time for a change after 32 years at Utah and 21 as the head coach. His defensive coordinator, Morgan Scalley, had already been labeled Utah's coach-in-waiting, so a succession plan was in place. Whittingham's decision to exit came two days after Moore's firing at Michigan, so the Wolverines' opening could have been in the back of his mind.\n\nMORE:Revisiting Michigan's sign-stealing scandal\n\nHere's a season-by-season breakdown of Whittingham's tenure at Utah:\n\nWhittingham had only three losing seasons at Utah, winning at least 10 games in eight different seasons.\n\nWhittingham guided the Utes to an undefeated season in the Mountain West in 2008 and won back-to-back conference titles in the Pac-12 between 2021 and 2022. \n\nMORE: Tracking every move of the 2025-26 colleeg football coaching carousel\n\nWhittingham ranks as the fourth-oldest head coach in the FBS:\n\nMichigan wasn't expected to make a head coaching change after going 9-3 in 2025, but Moore was fired on Dec. 10 after the university received evidence of a longstanding relationship between the coach and a staffer.\n\nReports have since alleged that the relationship began before Moore succeeded Jim Harbaugh as head coach in 2024 and that the relationship was rumored within the facility. Moore is married with three children.\n\nHours after being fired, Moore was arrested for allegedly breaking into the home of the woman with whom he was involved in the improper relationship and threatening to take his own life. Moore was hit with three charges on Dec. 12, including felony home invasion.\n\nMore reports in the wake of Moore's firing have detailed the erosion of relationships within Michigan's program, with The Athletic alleging Moore became \"increasingly volatile\" in the months leading up to his firing to the point that \"fellow staff members became concerned about his mental state.\n\nMORE:Explaining the Sherrone Moore scandal",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Pirates are reportedly one of the few teams interested in infielder Yoan Moncada in free agency.\n\nPittsburgh vowed to be aggressive this offseason to build a contending team around Paul Skenes and its deep pitching staff. MLB insider Francys Romero reported that the Pirates are one of four teams showing interest in Moncada.\n\n“Several teams, including the Angels, Pirates, White Sox, and Blue Jays, have shown early interest in free-agent third baseman Yoan Moncada, per sources,” Romero wrote on X on Friday. “Despite thumb and knee issues, Moncada had a solid 2025 and could contribute even more next season among third basemen.”\n\nMoncada spent last season with the Los Angeles Angels after spending one year with the Boston Red Sox and eight years with the Chicago White Sox. The Red Sox signed Moncada in 2015, as he was one of the top free agents available, but the infielder has struggled to live up to the hype.\n\nMoncada’s best season came in 2019 with the White Sox when he hit .315 with 25 home runs and 79 RBIs. But injuries have derailed his career as he hasn’t played over 100 games since 2022, when he played just 104. With the Angels last season, Moncada hit .234 with 12 home runs and 35 RBIs.\n\nIf the Pirates sign Moncada, he would join an infield that features Jared Triolo at third base, Nick Gonzalez at shortstop, newly-acquired Brandon Lowe at shortstop, and Spencer Horwitz at first base.\n\nMore Pirates: Aggressive Pirates Having Sensational Offseason Thus Far\n\nThe post Pirates Reportedly One Of Four Teams Interested In Intriguing Free Agent Infielder appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "title": "Solid-state batteries charge faster, last longer: review",
    "description": "Solid-state batteries are poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represent a transformational leap in energy storage.",
    "fullText": "Solid-state batteries charge in a fraction of the time, run cooler, and pack more energy into less space than traditional lithium-ion versions.\n\nA new review from the University of California, Riverside, published in Nano Energy, explains why this technology is poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represents a major leap in energy storage.\n\nThese batteries replace the flammable liquid found in standard versions with a solid material that is safer and far more efficient. Where today’s batteries may take 30 to 45 minutes to reach 80% charge, solid-state models can cut that time to 12 minutes, and in some cases, as little as three.\n\nLead author Cengiz Ozkan, a professor of mechanical engineering at UCR, said the benefits come down to chemistry and engineering. “By removing the liquid and using stable solid materials instead, we can safely push more electricity into the battery at once, without the risks of overheating or fires,” he said.\n\nConventional lithium-ion batteries move lithium ions, the particles that carry electric charge, through a liquid. But that liquid can degrade over time, limit charging speed, and pose fire risks. Solid-state batteries use a solid material instead, which offers a safer and more stable environment for lithium ions to move through. This enables faster, more efficient charging with fewer safety concerns.\n\nThe solid inside these batteries is known as a solid-state electrolyte. The review highlights three main types: sulfide-based, oxide-based, and polymer-based. Each type has strengths: some allow ions to move faster, others offer better long-term stability or are easier to manufacture. One standout group, sulfide-based electrolytes, performs almost as well as the liquid in current batteries, but without the downsides.\n\nThe researchers also describe the tools scientists now use to watch batteries work in real time. Techniques like neutron imaging and high-powered X-rays let researchers see how lithium moves inside a battery as it charges and discharges. This helps identify areas where the lithium gets stuck or where unwanted structures called “dendrites” start to grow. Dendrites are tiny, needle-like formations that can cause a battery to short-circuit or fail.\n\nUnderstanding these inner workings is key to making better batteries. “These imaging tools are like an MRI for batteries,” Ozkan said. “They let us watch the battery’s vital signs and make smarter design choices.”\n\nSolid-state batteries also tend to use lithium more efficiently. Many designs feature a lithium metal layer that can store more energy in less space than the graphite layers used in current batteries. This means solid-state batteries can be lighter and smaller while still powering devices for just as long, or longer.\n\nWhile conventional lithium-ion batteries typically begin to show noticeable degradation after approximately 5–8 years of use in electric vehicles, solid-state batteries could remain functional for 15–20 years or more, depending on usage and environmental factors.\n\n“Traditional lithium-ion batteries, while revolutionary, are reaching their performance and safety limits as electric vehicles, renewable energy grids, portable electronics, and aerospace systems become more widespread and demanding,” Ozkan said.\n\nOzkan said solid-state batteries could also play a pivotal role in the future of interstellar travel and space exploration.\n\nDue to their thermal and chemical stability, these batteries are better suited to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation conditions in outer space. They’re also able to store more power in less space, which is critical for missions where every cubic centimeter counts. And without liquid electrolytes, they would be more reliable in closed, oxygen-controlled environments like spacecraft or planetary bases.\n\nThe researchers’ goal with this review was to guide researchers and technologists in accelerating the development, scalability, and real-world deployment of solid-state systems.\n\nBut challenges remain. Making these batteries on a large scale is still difficult and expensive. The paper offers a roadmap for solving these problems, including developing better materials, refining how the battery parts interact, and improving factory techniques to make production easier.\n\n“Solid-state batteries are moving closer to reality every day,” Ozkan said. “Our review shows how far the science has come and what steps are needed next to make these batteries available for everyday use.”\n\n(Cover image of solid-state batteries: Just_Super/Getty)",

Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been placed into judicial liquidation — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency.\n\nThe company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr’s FootPrint Coalition, taxpayers, and many others.\n\nUltimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to “revolutionize the food chain” with insect-based protein. But don’t be too quick to attribute its failure to the ‘ick’ factor that many Westerners feel about bugs. Human food was never its core focus.\n\nInstead, Ÿnsect focused on producing insect protein for animal feed and pet food, two markets with very different economics and margins that the company never quite chose between.\n\nThat indecision extended to its M&A strategy. In 2021, Ÿnsect acquired Protifarm, a Dutch company raising mealworms for human food applications, adding a third market to the mix. Even as the company announced the deal, then-CEO Antoine Hubert admitted it would take a couple of years for human food to represent just 10% to 15% of Ÿnsect’s revenue.\n\n“We still see pet food and fish feed being the largest contributor to our revenues in the coming years,” Hubert declared at the time. In other words, Ÿnsect was acquiring a company in a market segment that would remain marginal for years — at a time when the startup desperately needed revenue growth.\n\nAnd revenue was the problem. According to publicly available data, Ÿnsect’s revenue from its main entity peaked at €17.8 million in 2021 (approximately $21 million) — a figure reportedly inflated by internal transfers between subsidiaries. By 2023, the company had racked up a net loss of €79.7 million ($94 million).\n\nSo how did a company with such meager revenue raise over $600 million? The answer wasn’t hype-driven crossover funds paying ambitious multiples during the 2021 funding frenzy. Instead, Ÿnsect attracted impact-focused investors like Astanor Ventures and public investment bank Bpifrance that bought into a compelling sustainability vision.\n\nIts pitch to them was simple — offering an alternative to resource-intensive proteins like fishmeal and soy. That same thesis also attracted significant capital to competitors like Better Origin and Innovafeed, and it seemed promising.\n\nBut the vision collided with market reality. Animal feed is a commodity market driven by price, not sustainability premiums. In a perfect world, insect protein would be fully circular, with insects fed on food waste that would otherwise go to landfill. But in practice, factory-scale insect production typically ends up relying on cereal byproducts that are already usable as animal feed — meaning insect protein just adds an expensive extra step. For animal feed, the math simply wasn’t working.\n\nŸnsect eventually recognized this. Pet food proved to be a different equation: it is less price-driven than animal feed and a far better market for insect protein, even with competition from other alternative proteins such as lab-grown meat. By 2023, the company refocused its strategy on pet food and other higher-margin segments, with Hubert citing broader economic pressures.\n\n“In an environment where there is inflation on energy and raw materials but also on the cost of capital and debt, we cannot afford to invest loads of resources in markets which are the least remunerative (animal feed), while you have other markets where there is a lot of demand, good returns and higher margins,” Hubert said at the time.\n\nThe 2023 pivot to pet food came too late. By then, Ÿnsect had already committed to a massive, capital-intensive bet that would ultimately doom the company. That bet was Ÿnfarm, a “giga-factory” in Northern France that the company billed “the world’s most expensive bug farm.” Built for insect production at scale, the facility consumed hundreds of millions in funding — money spent before Ÿnsect had proven its business model or figured out its unit economics.\n\nTo oversee Ÿnfarm’s launch, Ÿnsect brought in Shankar Krishnamoorthy, a former executive at French energy giant Engie. When that move to pet food failed to save the company, Krishnamoorthy replaced Hubert as CEO.\n\nŸnsect then shut down the production plant it had acquired from Protifarm and cut jobs. But shuttering one facility while operating a giga-factory built for the wrong market couldn’t solve the fundamental problem.\n\nFor Professor Joe Haslam, who teaches a course on Scaling Up in the MBA Program at IE Business School, “Ÿnsect’s struggles are not a mystery and not mainly about insects. They are the result of a mismatch between industrial ambition, capital markets, and timing, compounded by some execution and strategy choices.”\n\nThe fact that Ÿnsect failed doesn’t mean the entire insect farming sector is doomed. Competitor Innovafeed is reportedly holding up better, in part because it started with a smaller production site and is ramping up incrementally.\n\nFor Prof. Haslam, Ÿnsect exemplifies a broader European problem. “Ÿnsect is a case study in Europe’s scaling gap. We fund moonshots. We underfund factories. We celebrate pilots. We abandon industrialization. See Northvolt [a struggling Swedish battery maker], Volocopter [a German air taxi startup, and Lilium [a failed Germany flying taxi company],” he said.\n\nThe failure has prompted some soul-searching. Hubert himself co-founded Start Industrie, an association advocating for policies to support French industrial startups — a recognition that Europe needs more than just funding to build the next generation of deep-tech companies.",

    "fullText": "Did you know vodka in Russian means “little water”?\n\nThe origins of the modern words for “water” in the western world are ancient. There are two main roots for the names we have water: ap and wed. Ap was used when speaking of water as a “living force” in action, and wed when speaking of water as an inanimate object.\n\nBoth roots originate several thousand years ago in something called Proto-Indo European (PIE), believed to be spoken in what’s now Eastern Europe and Western Asia. PIE is the ancestor of most widely-spoken languages in the past several millennia like Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Persian, English, Spanish–really, most languages you know of today that are not of East Asian, Semitic, and African origin.\n\nThose two roots–ap and wed--form the two key root variations of the words you probably know for “water”. Proto-Indo European speakers supposedly called it akwa or wodor, depending on the context. In Sanskrit, water was apah. 3000 years ago, the Hittites called it watar. A thousand years later, speakers of proto-Germanic (the ancestor of English, Germanic, and Scandinavian languages) would say akwo or watar. Around the same time, Latin speakers decided to stick with aqua, and English speakers seemed to settle on variations of water, dropping akwo. Old English speakers said wæter.\n\nThat’s right: The Spanish word “aqua” and the English word “water” have changed little in several thousand years. The Greeks originally called it hudor, the source of the prefixes “hydro” and “hydra” (hudra); the Cherokee say ama. An ancient Sanskrit speaker would understand the modern Romanian word for water: apa.\n\nAnd Russian speaker call it voda. So, voda+ka = vodka, or “little water”, making a vodka tonic a “little water with water”. Now you know.",

    "description": "In 12 months, @aarondfrancis changed his life by bypassing fear and embracing risk. Now, he’s working his dream job @tuple. Get his full story on The ReadME Project:",
    "fullText": "For every snarky comment, there are 10x as many people admiring your work.\n\nAaron Francis // Marketing Engineer, Tuple\n\nThe ReadME Project amplifies the voices of the open source community: the maintainers, developers, and teams whose contributions move the world forward every day.\n\nNo matter how hard you work, it still takes a little bit of luck for something to hit. That can be discouraging, since luck feels like a force outside our control. But the good news is that we can increase our chances of encountering good luck. That may sound like magic, but it’s not supernatural. The trick is to increase the number of opportunities we have for good fortune to find us. The simple act of publishing your work is one of the best ways to invite a little more luck into your life.\n\nBefore we get into the “how,” it’s important to get on the same page about the “what.” What are we talking about when we say “luck?” There are a lot of definitions that could apply, but let’s stick with a simple one: Luck is when something unexpected and good happens to you. Unexpected and good. Who doesn’t want to increase the odds of something unexpected and good?\n\nIn our world, luck can include:\n\nHaving your OSS library take off\n\nBeing invited to speak at a conference\n\nGetting a new consulting client\n\nMaking new friends in your community\n\nNone of these things are totally in your control, which can at times feel frustrating.\n\nHow can we increase the odds of finding luck? By being a person who works in public. By doing work and being public about it, you build a reputation for yourself. You build a track record. You build a public body of work that speaks on your behalf better than any resume ever could.\n\nThe goal is not to become famous, the goal is to increase the chances of luck finding us. For me, one of the most helpful ways to think about this has always been the concept of the “Luck Surface Area,” described in an old post by Jason Roberts. He wrote (and note, the emphasis is mine):\n\n\"The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you’re passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.\"\n\nGoing further, he codifies it into a formula where:\n\nThe more things you do multiplied by the more people you tell, the larger your Luck Surface Area becomes. The larger your Luck Surface Area, the more likely you are to catch luck as it flows by.\n\nBefore you can publish your work, you have to actually do the work. The good news for you is that by even reading this Guide on The ReadME Project, you’ve probably already self-selected into a group of people for whom “doing things” comes somewhat naturally. You’re a developer, a designer, a creator, an author, or something else entirely.  Whatever moniker you want to give yourself, you’re built to do things, and that’s the important part.\n\nIf that doesn’t ring true for you, you may fall into one of two groups:\n\nYou actually are doing things, you’ve just trained yourself to think that anything you do isn’t worth sharing.\n\nYou want to be doing things, but you can’t bring yourself to get started.\n\nIf you’re in the first group, you may need to step back and reframe the work you’re already doing. This is a common blind spot for people who are executing at a high level! They’ve forgotten just how much they know. They think that they’re not doing anything interesting because they assume that everyone knows as much as they do. This effect is only exacerbated when everyone in your immediate vicinity is at a similar—or higher—skill level. As you become more of an expert, your quality bar gets higher and higher and you forget that everything you know is not known by everyone.\n\nIf you’re in this group I want to give you a challenge: Watch the communities where you hang out and see what people are sharing and what gets noticed. Is it something you could have done? Is it something you’ve already done? At its worst this could lead you in the direction of becoming bitter, critical, and thinking that you’re smarter than everyone. To that I say “resist!” There is no life there. My encouragement to you is to view that as objective evidence that people want to know all of the things that you already know! There is a huge opportunity for you, should you decide to start sharing your work.\n\nIf you’re in the second group, you just need to start. Start anywhere, start on anything, start something. You’ll never come up with the perfect idea for an OSS library, a business, a podcast, or an article by just thinking about it. Start on something, today. It won’t be the perfect version of the thing you have in your head, but you’ll be in motion. Motion begets motion, progress begets progress. Pick the smallest thing you can do and get started.\n\nDoing the work is the most important part. It’s the nucleus around which everything else revolves. What that “work” looks like, though, is entirely up to you! That’s the fun part. It can take any form and be in any domain. Wherever your curiosity or expertise draw you, dive into that.\n\nProjects outside of work are a good place to dive into your curiosity.\n\nIf you want to make a thermal receipt printer that prints GitHub issues, you should.\n\nIf you want to turn a prefabricated shed into an office, go for it.\n\nIf you want to go all in on an SVG drawing tool, do it.\n\nIf you want to write tens of thousands of words about the infrastructure of modern money, that’s a newsletter.\n\nYour curiosity will naturally pull you in certain directions, so don’t be afraid to go super deep into a topic that you’re interested in. When a person is truly interested in the thing they’re writing or talking about, their excitement is contagious. Whatever you’re excited about, be excited about it publicly. Whatever you’re curious about, be curious about it publicly. People will want to follow along and you’ll inspire people along the way.\n\nProjects at work can be a good place to dive into your expertise.\n\nIt's likely you're constantly solving problems and learning interesting things at your job. This is a great opportunity to take what you’re already doing and repurpose it for the benefit of others. You can turn those learnings into blog posts, conference talks, meetups, podcasts, or open source projects.\n\nOf course not everything you do at work is shareable. If the specifics aren’t shareable, the concepts, lessons, and takeaways likely are. While you’re working, keep a scratch pad open and jot down any problems you come across, interesting patterns you see, or things you found confusing. Do this for a month and you’ll have more things to share than you know what to do with!\n\nYou’ve done the work, now it's time to tell people.\n\nThis part of the formula can be harder for most of us. Most of us really enjoy the building aspect but start to get a little shy when it comes to telling people about the stuff we’ve built. That could be for any number of reasons: fear, embarrassment, self-preservation, or an aversion to being perceived as hawking your wares.\n\nIt’s a valuable exercise to investigate whether or not you resonate with any of those reasons. Are you afraid people are going to make fun of what you built? Are you embarrassed that it isn’t up to your own (admittedly high) standards? Are you waiting for some elusive perfect moment? Do you have an aversion to “marketing” and don’t want to become the thing you hate? Whatever it is for you, I encourage you to really dig into it and see if that fear is worth keeping around.\n\nSharing things you’re learning or making is not prideful. People are drawn to other people in motion. People want to follow along, people want to learn things, people want to be a part of your journey. It’s not bragging to say, “I’ve made a thing and I think it’s cool!” Bringing people along is a good thing for everyone. By publishing your work you’re helping people learn. You’re inspiring others to create.\n\nYou can “publish” anywhere. For me that’s mostly Twitter because that’s where most of my peers hang out. It doesn’t have to be Twitter for you. It could be GitHub, a newsletter, a podcast, forums, your blog, YouTube, or something completely different that’s not even on my radar. Anywhere that’s not your hard drive counts!\n\nPublishing is a skill, it’s something you can learn. You’ll need to build your publishing skill just like you built every other skill you have.\n\nDon’t be afraid to publish along the way. You don’t have to wait until you’re done to drop a perfect, finished artifact from the sky (in fact, you may use that as an excuse to never publish). People like stories, so use that to your benefit. Share the wins, the losses, and the thought processes. Bring us along! If you haven’t been in the habit of sharing your work, it’s going to feel weird when you start. That’s normal! Keep going, you get used to it.\n\nYou’ve done the work. You’ve hit the publish button. You’ve done your part!\n\nYou’ve increased the odds that good, unexpected things will come your way. The exact form is hard to predict, but here are a few potential outcomes:\n\nPeople start to know you as the person that talks about X, Y, and Z.\n\nYou start to get emails from people saying that they read your stuff and liked it.\n\nYou get a DM about a job you might be interested in.\n\nPeople ask you if you’re taking on new clients.\n\nSomeone you’ve never met or interacted with will mention you as being an expert in your area.\n\nA meetup asks you to come talk about the things you’ve been sharing.\n\nYou become friends with other people in your industry.\n\nYour OSS library starts gaining mindshare.\n\nThis is not a random list of made-up examples, it’s a list of things that have literally happened to me once I got over my fears and started sharing my work. I had been doing the work all along, but was too afraid to publish. Once I overcame that fear, my Luck Surface Area expanded and good, unexpected things started happening.\n\nDo the work. Don’t be afraid to dive deep into your curiosity and your expertise. We need more people that are intensely curious. We need more people with deep expertise.\n\nTell people. Press publish, bring us along, share the journey. Tell us what you’ve learned, what you’ve built, or what you’re excited about.\n\nThe formula may be simple, but I’ll admit it’s not always easy. It’s scary to put yourself out there. It’s hard to open yourself up to criticism. People online can be mean. But for every snarky comment, there are ten times as many people quietly following along and admiring not only your work, but your bravery to put it out publicly. And at some point, one of those people quietly following along will reach out with a life-changing opportunity and you’ll think, “Wow, that was lucky.”\n\nHello, my name is Aaron.

He works in IT and earns about $90,000 a year, while she earns roughly $55,000. He wrote that growing up lower middle class shaped his careful approach to money.\n\nUntil recently, he wrote, their everyday spending had felt manageable.

He created a rough budget covering flights, hotels, trains, food, and tours, estimating the total at about $4,500 for both of them — excluding shopping.\n\nHe suggested that if they started saving immediately, each could set aside about $400 to $450 per month over several months and split the cost evenly.\n\nAfter reviewing the spreadsheet, she laughed and questioned why he was treating the trip \"like a business contract,\" pointing out that he earns significantly more.

During that discussion, she compared him to an ex who never asked her to pay for vacations.\n\nSince then, he said, the tension continued. She made sarcastic comments about money during meals, and later compromise proposals were dismissed.\n\nHe suggested splitting costs based on income, such as a 60-40 arrangement or covering flights while she handled her spending money.

    "title": "Human evolution’s biggest mystery has started to unravel. How 2025 tipped the scales",
    "description": "Scientists working to solve human evolution’s biggest mystery made a big breakthrough in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Human evolution’s biggest mystery, which emerged 15 years ago from a 60,000-year-old pinkie finger bone, finally started to unravel in 2025.\n\nAnalysis of DNA extracted from the fossil electrified the scientific community in 2010, when it revealed a previously unknown human population that had, in the distant past, encountered and interbred with our own species, Homo sapiens. This enigmatic group became known as the Denisovans after Denisova Cave in Siberia’s Altai Mountains, where the pinkie finger was found.\n\nDespite intimate knowledge of this population’s genetic makeup, traces of which millions of people carry today, scientists knew nothing about the appearance of the Denisovans, or where they lived or why they disappeared. The discovery, and the questions it unleashed, galvanized a generation of geneticists, archaeologists and paleoanthropologists.\n\nSome of that work paid off this year, and scientists at last put a face to the Denisovan name by extracting new clues from another well-known fossil: a prehistoric human skull that didn’t seem to fit with any known group. Now, other jigsaw pieces have begun to fall into place.\n\nWhen the skull came to light in Harbin in northeastern China in 2018 after being stashed for safekeeping at the bottom of a well for decades, some scientists had a hunch that it might be Denisovan.\n\nDNA sequences from the group had been detected in the genomes of present-day Asians, but not Europeans, suggesting that this region was where the Denisovans predominantly lived.\n\nBased on its distinctive shape, the researchers attributed the skull to a newfound species they called Homo longi or “Dragon Man.” The dozen or so Denisovan fossils that had been identified since 2010 using DNA were too small and fragmentary to warrant an official species name.\n\nGetting ancient DNA from the skull, which was estimated to be 146,000 years old, was the key to understanding whether there was a link between Dragon Man and the Denisovans. However, it proved to be tricky.\n\nA team led by Qiaomei Fu, a geneticist and professor at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, tested six bone samples from Dragon Man’s lone surviving tooth and the cranium’s petrous bone, a dense piece at the base of the skull that’s often a rich source of DNA in fossils. However, the samples yielded no results.\n\nBut Fu, who as a young researcher had been part of the team at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, that first discovered the Denisovans, reported in June that her team had been able to retrieve Denisovan genetic material from an unexpected \n\nThat information wasn’t a slam-dunk result. The genetic material researchers had retrieved was mitochondrial DNA, which, unlike nuclear DNA, is only inherited through the maternal line, providing an incomplete picture of an individual’s genomic ancestry. This finding meant, potentially, that Dragon Man could have been a mix of two species, something that’s not unprecedented. In 2018, scientists revealed a fossilized bone from Denisova Cave that belonged to a girl with a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan dad.\n\nHowever, the team also recovered protein fragments from the petrous bone samples, which — though less detailed than DNA — suggested the Dragon Man skull belonged to a Denisovan population.\n\nTogether, the two lines of evidence “cleared up some of the mystery surrounding this population,” Fu told CNN in June when the research was published. “After 15 years, we know the first Denisovan skull.”\n\nThe DNA finding makes it likely that Homo longi will become the official designation for the dozen or so other Denisovan fossils, Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist and research leader in human evolution at London’s Natural History Museum, said in an email.\n\nRyan McRae and Briana Pobiner, paleoanthropologists at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, agreed, although they said the name Denisovan would likely persist as a popular name, much like how most people call Homo neanderthalensis Neanderthals today.\n\n“While more work needs to be done to build the body of evidence and give scientists a more complete view of Denisovan anatomy, habitat, and behavior, being able to link complete fossils with the molecular evidence is a huge step forward,” McRae and Pobiner wrote in an annual list of the top stories in human evolution.\n\nAdditional evidence could be in hand, waiting to be identified, researchers suggest, and with it 2026 could be set for more groundbreaking revelations.\n\nA skull fossil, with its telltale bumps and ridges, can reveal a great deal about what an individual looked like, according to John Gurche, a paleoartist who creates reconstructions of ancient human ancestors for museums, including the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History. He recreated Dragon Man’s face for National Geographic.\n\nAssuming the Dragon Man skull belonged to a typical Denisovan individual, scientists said the ancient human would have had pronounced brow ridges, large teeth and lacked our high foreheads. But, if dressed in modern attire, this prehistoric relative may not have drawn too many stares on a subway train.\n\nGurche said that he uses known relationships between soft and bony tissue in humans and apes to recreate facial features, such as the breadth of the eyeball, dimensions of nasal cartilage and the thickness of soft tissue in some parts of the face. More challenging were features about which the skull “offers little information,” including the form of the lips and ears, and placement of the hair.\n\nWith molecular evidence now linking Dragon Man to the Denisovans, it will be easier for paleoanthropologists to identify other potential Denisovan remains, including skull fossils from sites in China that have long defied classification.\n\nMore revelations could come from another skull fossil discovered in China in 2022, which hasn’t been formally described in scientific literature. It’s the third skull to be unearthed at the site known as Yunxian in China’s Hubei province and is thought to date back around 1 million years. The other two craniums were found in 1990.\n\nA digital reconstruction published in September of the second skull, which was badly squashed, from the site suggested it was an early ancestor of Dragon Man, meaning the lineage could have originated much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe researchers’ wider analysis, based on the reconstruction and more than 100 other skull fossils, also significantly pushes back the timeline for the emergence of species such as our own, Homo sapiens, and Homo neanderthalensis, by 400,000 years.\n\nHowever, the findings attracted some skepticism. More details about the third Yunxian skull would enable the team to test the accuracy of the reconstruction and its placement within the human family tree.\n\nA 200,000-year-old tooth, similar in appearance to the molar still attached to Dragon Man’s skull, may be set to shake up what’s known about the Denisovans and the human family tree more broadly next year and beyond. Researchers found the tooth during an excavation of Denisova Cave in 2020.\n\nStéphane Peyrégne, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and his colleagues have since analyzed the molar and from it recovered a Denisovan’s full genome — a highly detailed set of genetic information that can reveal past genetic diversity and evolution.\n\nIt’s only the second time scientists have been able to sequence a “high coverage” genome from a Denisovan fossil — the first was from the finger fossil that revealed the Denisovans’ existence.\n\nThe scientists shared the genome analysis in October on what’s known as a preprint server, which allows study authors to post early versions of their work online, and is undergoing peer review by other researchers. Peyrégne declined to comment on the paper until it’s formally published next year. Stringer described the findings as “very important.”\n\nThe genome allows further investigation of Denisovan biological traits that may influence human health today. For example, a study published in August suggested that a Denisovan gene variant involved in the production of mucous and saliva may have helped Homo sapiens adapt to new environments.\n\nThe new genome is also much older than the first and allows geneticists to probe more deeply into Denisovan history and reconstruct relationships between different ancient populations.\n\nThe genome represents a Denisovan man who lived in a small group 200,000 years ago in Denisova Cave. The group’s analysis revealed that not only had his ancestors apparently interbred with early Neanderthals, but the individual also had ancestry from an unknown “super archaic” group for which there is currently no ancient DNA match.\n\nMcRae at the Smithsonian said traces of these “ghost lineages” have been found in the DNA of modern humans as well, and scientists aren’t sure who they are. They could represent other extinct hominins such as Homo erectus or Homo floresiensis, sometimes known as the “hobbit.”\n\n“Or, it could represent hominins that we genuinely haven’t found in the fossil record. They’re ghosts until we have something to trace them back to,” he said via email.\n\nFiguring out the identity of this group will be a fresh mystery for experts in human evolution to ponder in 2026.\n\n Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.",

This humble 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range had a rough life as a taxi in the United Kingdom, and it racked up an impressive number of miles in just four years: 238,000, to be precise.\n\nAfter so much abuse, any car would have some faults pop up, and this Tesla is no different. But the severity and costs to repair all the issues are undoubtedly much lower than on a comparable gas-powered car.\n\nFirst things first, the ex-taxi Tesla still has its original high-voltage battery, original rear electric motor, original brakes, original bodywork and original windows. That’s mighty impressive, but it gets better still. Except for the steering wheel, which has seen better days and should probably be replaced sooner rather than later, the interior is in great shape after so many miles and passenger rides. The same goes for the bodywork.\n\nGetting back to the big battery, it’s still going strong, with a reported 85.5% state of health, which practically means the car can achieve 85.5% of the range it had on its first day.\n\nThat’s all good news, but the repairs and maintenance costs are where things get interesting. So far, this Tesla Model 3 Long Range has never broken down, and most of the money was spent on normal maintenance items. It’s now on its seventh set of tires, which seems a bit daunting.\n\nStay informed with our newsletter every weekday   back \n\nIt had several bushes replaced, including the rear motor mounts, and the pedestrian warning sound speaker failed at 232,000 miles. In total, the car’s two owners have spent the equivalent of $7,566 (£5,603), including tires, wiper blades, cabin air filters, suspension components and labor.\n\nThat’s not really impressive, but the car makes up for the maintenance costs by saving money on fuel. In total, this Model 3 used 92.6 megawatt-hours of energy, with 28.2 MWh coming from regenerative braking alone. The car used 64,422 kilowatt-hours of payable electricity, and with the average price of $0.17/kWh in the United States, it means that it cost the equivalent of $10,951 to recharge. That’s $2,738 per year or $0.04/mile.\n\nThe fact that the Tesla Model 3 is very efficient helps a lot, with this particular car averaging an impressive 4.2 miles/kWh since February. But there you have it. You might not love Tesla as a brand–or its outspoken CEO–but there’s no denying that the cars it makes are hard to beat.\n\nUsed Tesla EVs Are A Bargain. Reliability Isn't Their Strong Suit\n\n'Absolutely Relentless': What Tesla Had To Learn From Tearing Down Chinese EVs\n\nTesla May Add CarPlay.

    "fullText": "When the flu strikes, it can feel relentless: rising fever, hacking cough, stuffy nose and sore throat. For many people, relief can come in the form of Tamiflu, a prescription antiviral medication used to treat and even prevent the illness.\n\nBut some people may not realize that Tamiflu isn’t the only option.\n\nOther flu treatments are available in the United States. These alternatives sometimes fly under the radar, in part because some are targeted for specific populations. But Xofluza, a one-dose pill, is approved for people 5 years and older – and can be a strong alternative for some people who may otherwise be prescribed Tamiflu.\n\nAntiviral medications tend to work best when started within two days after symptoms begin, so having easy access to treatment options is key for treating the flu most effectively.\n\nTo treat flu this season, there are four antiviral drugs recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Tamiflu or oseltamivir, Xofluza or baloxavir, Relenza or zanamivir, and Rapivab or peramivir.\n\nTamiflu is used to treat flu in people ages 2 weeks and older, and to reduce the chance of getting the flu in people 1 year and older. The medicine is administered in liquid form or capsules, and typically must be taken twice daily for five days when used for flu treatment. When used for prevention after exposure, it is typically taken once daily for 10 days. Available as a generic or under the trade name Tamiflu, it may cost about $50 or less without insurance. The most common side effects include nausea and vomiting.\n\nAs another option, Xofluza is administered as a single-dose tablet and approved for ages 5 and older. It can be used to treat or prevent the flu, and it may cost nearly $200 without insurance, but eligible patients can use coupons to lessen costs. The most common side effects include diarrhea and vomiting.\n\n“The most common complaint I hear about is vomiting from Tamiflu,” Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician based in Texas and author of the Baby 411 book series, said in an email. She referenced a 2023 study that showed about 18% of people experience vomiting with Tamiflu versus 5% with Xofluza.\n\nThe study also found that about 5% of people get diarrhea with Xofluza compared with none taking Tamiflu. “I’ve also had a few pediatric patients experience moodiness with Tamiflu, which is reported in the literature,” she said.\n\nThe “biggest difference” between Tamiflu and Xofluza is that Xofluza can stop viral shedding in one day while Tamiflu may take about three days, Brown said.\n\nThat means the rest of the household may have less exposure to the flu and fewer people may come down with it, but “both antivirals will help reduce the duration of the misery by a couple of days,” Brown said. For instance, with treatment, some people may experience five days of flu symptoms instead of seven.\n\nRapivab is one of the other prescription medications approved to treat flu. The drug is approved for ages 6 months and older, given once as an intravenous infusion by a health care provider. It may cost up to about $1,000 without insurance, and the most common adverse reaction in adults tends to be diarrhea.\n\nLastly, Relenza is the other recommended flu medication. It is inhaled in powder form, and typically administered using an inhaler device twice a day for five days. The prescription drug is approved to treat flu in ages 7 and older, and for preventive use in ages 5 and older. It may cost up to about $90 without insurance. Side effects include allergic reaction, dizziness or irritation of the nose, and it is not recommended for people with breathing problems, such as asthma.\n\nAmong the recommended flu treatments, Tamiflu tends to be the go-to flu medication for most patients. But Xofluza is becoming more widely used, Brown said.\n\nHowever, it may not always be available in pharmacies, recommended by providers or covered by insurance.\n\n“I suspect it is region-dependent,” Brown said about access to treatment.\n\n“When one part of the country has surging flu cases, there is higher demand. We have not encountered this issue in Austin,” she said. For instance, this flu season, she has only had one Xofluza prescription that she needed to send to a different pharmacy because the first pharmacy was out of stock.\n\nBut overall, “Xofluza is rising in popularity over Tamiflu,” Brown said.\n\n“One dose. Fewer side effects. More insurances are covering the cost of it now and manufacturer coupon makes it less expensive than in previous years,” she said, adding that she prefers it for her patients. “But all of the factors above–cost, ability to swallow a pill, availability can impact that decision.”\n\nAnother factor that may impact decisions: There is a growing concern about the influenza virus developing resistance to Xofluza.\n\n“This is \n\n“That happens sometimes around 10% of the time, so it’s not trivial. And that’s why I think the longer-term Tamiflu continues to be favored – that and the side effect of diarrhea,” he said. “So, Tamiflu tends to be recommended more frequently, despite the fact that you do have to take it for five days.”\n\nXofluza resistance has appeared to occur even more frequently in younger children, Dr. Tim Uyeki, chief medical officer of the influenza division at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a call earlier this month of the CDC’s Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA).\n\n“This emergence of baloxavir resistance is associated with a longer duration of symptoms,” Uyeki said during the call. “Fortunately, transmission of a baloxavir-resistant virus from person to person has been very, very limited. It’s been reported, but it appears to be very uncommon and there’s no circulation of baloxavir-resistant viruses or oseltamivir-resistant viruses in the general population.”\n\nNational influenza experts discussed on the COCA call that Tamiflu or oseltamivir is preferred for treating hospitalized patients and people with progressive illness.\n\nXofluza is not recommended during pregnancy, while breastfeeding, for outpatients with complicated or progressive illness, severely immunosuppressed people or hospitalized patients, because of the lack of information on its use for these groups.\n\nBut there are situations for which Xofluza may be preferred.\n\n“For a patient with known or suspected influenza B, baloxavir has much greater efficacy against influenza B compared to oseltamivir,” Uyeki said during the call, adding that the medication is “generally well tolerated.”\n\n“A single dose of baloxavir is not associated with many side effects and fewer side effects compared to oseltamivir,” he said. “For patients, I think every patient would prefer a single oral dose of baloxavir versus five days, twice-daily of oseltamivir treatment.”\n\nAt the end of the call, Uyeki added that researchers should continue studying the potential benefits of treating flu patients with a combination of antiviral medications, especially those with severe disease.\n\n“I think we need more data for treatment of influenza in hospitalized influenza patients, so severe influenza,” he said. “And for that we need more data for a combination antiviral treatment, for example oseltamivir-plus-baloxavir.”",

    "fullText": "Republican senators have joined Democrats to issue a pointed message to Donald Trump as he prepares to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky, 47, will travel to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a possible peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump, 79, who previously tried to bully Ukraine into accepting a U.S.-brokered deal favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Putin, 73, hit Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles over Christmas, GOP senators Thom Tillis, Jerry Moran, and John Barrasso, along with Democratic colleagues, offered a reminder that Putin, 73, is a “ruthless murderer.”\n\n“Today’s decision by Putin to launch attacks rather than hold fire is a sobering reminder for us all: Putin is a ruthless murderer who has no interest in peace and cannot be trusted,” reads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee release.\n\nThe senators added, “It bears repeating that President Zelenskyy agreed to a Christmas truce, but Putin declined, yet he directs soldiers to continue to commit brutal crimes of aggression on one of Christianity’s holiest days.”\n\nTillis, 65, a senator from North Carolina, Moran, 71, a senator from Kansas, and Barrasso, 73, a senator from Wyoming, were joined by Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

    "fullText": "The performance-enhancing altitude mask that Olympic hopeful Sivert Guttorm Bakken was wearing when he was found dead this week “is not part of the Norwegian Biathlon Association’s organized training programs,” the federation said Friday.\n\nBakken, 27, was found dead in his hotel room in the Alpine town of Lavaze in the Trentino region of Italy on Tuesday.\n\nHe was located at high altitude, with the Lavaze Pass measuring 1,808 meters (nearly 6,000 feet) in elevation.\n\nThe fact Bakken was wearing a device aimed at simulating high-altitude conditions, which can potentially improve endurance, has raised concerns — especially since Bakken was diagnosed with myocarditis, a heart condition, in 2022 and sat out two seasons.\n\n“The use of such equipment is not part of the Norwegian Biathlon Association’s organized training programs. However, we are aware that a few individual athletes have acquired such equipment. Any use must be in line with the guidelines of the Olympic Council. Such use is not in conflict with the Norwegian sports regulations,” the federation said in a statement, adding that it banned the use of such masks immediately after Bakken’s death “until further notice.”\n\nBakken was the reigning European champion in the 10-kilometer sprint and two relays and was preparing to compete in the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. He had one individual World Cup victory and three in relays.\n\nHe competed as recently as last Sunday in Annecy, France, finishing 20th in a 15-kilometer mass start event. A day earlier, he finished 18th in a 12.5-kilometer pursuit.\n\n“There are currently many rumors and unconfirmed information related to Bakken’s death. Only when we have received a report from the police and forensic authorities in Italy will we be able to comment on what probably happened and the probable cause of death. This will probably not happen until next week,” said Bernt Heiberg, a lawyer employed by the federation.\n\n“We emphasize that although it has been reported that the deceased was wearing an altitude mask when he was found, there is currently no confirmed information about what role this may have played in the death,” Heiberg added, “We would again urge caution in discussing details related to the death that have not been confirmed by the Italian police at this time.”\n\nAn autopsy on Bakken was due to be performed in Italy before his body can be brought home for a funeral.\n\nNorway is the dominant force in biathlon. Its athletes won six golds and 14 medals in the sport at the last Winter Olympics in Beijing nearly four years ago — twice as many second-ranked France in both categories.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

The Sun reports that the Ukrainian-born Sadovenko was close to former Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nSadovenko served as the deputy defense minister up until he and Shoigu were ousted in May 2024 as part of a massive shakeup at the Kremlin. Shoigu, to whom Sadavenko had reportedly acted as a “gatekeeper,” is now the secretary of Russia’s security council.\n\nSadavenko, who had been sanctioned by Britain and other western states, reportedly showed no signs of ill health before his death.\n\nHe had previously been embroiled in scandal after his wife, Maria Kitaeva, left him for another deputy defense minister, Timur Ivanov, according to The Sun.\n\nIvanov, 50, was arrested in April 2024 and convicted in July 2025 on charges of embezzlement and money laundering, receiving a 13-year prison sentence, the Associated Press reported.\n\nSince the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, numerous top government officials have died under suspicious or sudden circumstances.\n\nOn Monday, a funeral was held in Moscow for Stanislav Orlov, 44, the head of a notorious volunteer brigade of neo-Nazi football hooligans who have fought in Ukraine.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets have reported that Orlov, nicknamed the “Spaniard,” was ambushed and shot by Moscow’s own security forces earlier this month, according to The Guardian.\n\nOrlov’s death adds to a growing list of Russian military and civilian leaders who have died, most notably Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenaries.\n\nPrigozhin, 62, was killed in a plane crash in August 2023, weeks after he led an insurrection against Putin. He had once been close enough to the Russian dictator to earn the nickname “Putin’s chef.”\n\nIn July this year, Putin sacked Transport Minister Roman Starovoit, 53, who was found dead hours later in a park with a gunshot wound to the head. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nOn the same day, Andrei Korneichuk, 42, another transportation official who had worked closely with Starovoit, collapsed and died of what was said to be a heart attack.\n\nOther deaths have long sparked jokes about staying away from windows and seen a series of former high-ranking officials being suddenly found dead stories below where they were last seen.\n\nHowever not all sudden deaths are equal. Ukraine has been able to assassinate several leading Russian military figures many hundreds of miles behind enemy lines in recent months.\n\nLast week, a top general, Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, died after a bomb exploded under his car. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation believes Ukraine could be behind the blast.",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Men who were part of the group of Venezuelan migrants that the United States government transferred earlier this year to a prison in El Salvador demanded justice on Friday, days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the Trump administration must give them legal due process.\n\nThe men told reporters in Venezuela’s capital that they hope legal organizations can push their claims in court. Their press conference was organized by Venezuela’s government, which had previously said it had retained legal services for the immigrants.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to give legal due process to the 252 Venezuelan men, either by providing court hearings or returning them to the U.S. The ruling opens a path for the men to challenge the Trump administration’s allegation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang and subject to removal under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe men have repeatedly said they were physically and psychologically tortured while at the notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\n“Today, we are here to demand justice before the world for the human rights violations committed against each of us, and to ask for help from international organizations to assist us in our defense so that our human rights are respected and not violated again,” Andry Blanco told reporters in Caracas, where roughly two dozen of the migrants gathered Friday.\n\nSome of the men shared the daily struggles they now face — including fear of leaving their home or encountering law enforcement — as a consequence of what they said were brutal abuses while in prison. The men did not specify what justice should look like in their case, but not all are interested in returning to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Nolberto Aguilar said of the U.S. government.\n\nThe men were flown to El Salvador in March. They were sent to their home country in July as part of a prisoner swap between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nCamilla Fabri, Venezuelan vice minister of foreign affairs for international communications, said Maduro's government is working with a bar association in the U.S. and “all human rights organizations to prepare a major lawsuit against Trump and the United States government, so that they truly acknowledge all the crimes they have committed against” the men.",

In an email Wednesday to The Associated Press, Redd said he pulled out of the concert in the wake of the renaming.\n\n“When I saw the name change on the Kennedy Center website and then hours later on the building, I chose to cancel our concert,” Redd said.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him.\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump's handpicked board approved the renaming, which scholars have said violates the law. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump’s name from the building once he leaves office, and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.\n\nThe law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person’s name on the building’s exterior.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge this week canceled the trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported, and scheduled a hearing on whether the prosecution is being vindictive in pursuing a human smuggling case against him.\n\nAbrego Garcia has become a centerpiece of the debate over immigration after the Trump administration deported him in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nAbrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday’s order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.\n\nAt that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.\n\nWhen Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.\n\nYears earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.\n\nMembers of President Donald Trump’s administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.\n\nAbrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "In the Department of Justice’s latest release of files related to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, prison notes share more insight into Epstein's mental state while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges\n\nEpstein died by suicide in his cell on Aug. 10, 2019, but a suicide risk assessment form dated Aug. 1, 2019 states, \"He said he is Jewish and he said in his religion suicide is against the religion\"\n\nThe DOJ has released a trove of files relating to the Epstein probe, many of which have been redacted\n\nDays before Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019, the sex offender claimed he would never take his own life because, he said, suicide is forbidden in his Jewish faith.\n\nIn the Department of Justice’s latest release of files related to its Epstein investigation, prison notes from his time at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City — where he was held while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges — offer a closer look at his mental state.\n\nThe notes mentioned a possible suicide attempt on July 23, 2019. According to the notes, Epstein told an interviewers that \"he could not remember what happened\" on the day in question \"because of his \" 'sleep apnea.'\"\n\nDuring a psychological observation from July 26, 2019, it was written that Epstein \"does not like pain and never attempt (sic) to harm himself.\"\n\nA suicide risk assessment form dated Aug. 1, 2019, stated, \"He said he is Jewish and he said in his religion suicide is against the religion,\" per the report. \"Overall, his current protective factors override his risk factors for suicidality. He is currently psychologically stable. He denied feeling hopeless. He is reporting positive future plans and reasons to live for.\"\n\nThe report listed Epstein's \"overall acute suicide risk\" as \"low.\"\n\nThe notes also show Epstein denied having suicidal ideation on Aug. 8, 2019 — two days before he was found hanged in his cell. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe DOJ has released a trove of files relating to the Epstein probe, many of which have been redacted. Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act in November, mandating the release of the investigation materials. President Donald Trump signed the law despite initially opposing it.\n\nThe law permitted the DOJ to leave out or redact certain materials, including information that would potentially identify victims.\n\nTrump's name is found several times in the files and he can be seen in a picture with Epstein. The photo was one of several removed from the DOJ's website before it was restored following backlash.\n\nUpon the release of the latest batch of materials, the DOJ said the files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump.\"\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nAlso in different images were several well-known individuals, including former President Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Michael Jackson and Kevin Spacey.\n\nEpstein's longtime co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence after a sex trafficking conviction.",

    "fullText": "How to weed through Slack's never-ending parade of pings? Anduril's COO has some advice.\n\nMatt Grimm has overseen the defense technology company since its starting days. He cofounded Anduril with Palmer Luckey, Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, and Joseph Chen. Before Anduril, Grimm worked at Palantir.\n\nIn a walkaround interview with Sourcery, Grimm said that he often popped into Slack channels where employees didn't expect to see him.\n\n\"They will see me chirp in on some random thread in some random channel,\" Grimm said. \"People will be like, 'How the hell did you see this?'\"\n\nGrimm said he sorts his Slack messages by both unread and most recent. When he's between meetings, walking between buildings, or has five minutes to spare, he said he'll read the messages in that order.\n\nThe strategy isn't \"foolproof,\" he said, and with about 7,000 employees at Anduril, he said he can't read every message. This method is for reading through channels. If something really needs his attention, Grimm said he trusts that he'll receive a direct message.\n\n\"It works enough to get the pulse of what's going on,\" he said.\n\nOther corporate leaders have their own Slack strategy. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei sends long-form Slack essays that fuel debate.\n\n\"You can go back and read all the past ones, and it tells the history of Anthropic,\" said Sholto Douglas, a Member of the Technical Staff at the AI firm.\n\nOthers intentionally set a distance. Canva CEO Melanie Perkins doesn't have Slack on her phone, so she can \"actually tune out\" when she shuts her laptop. If there's an emergency, someone will call her, she said.\n\nSlack cofounder Cal Henderson told Business Insider that his three biggest tips for using the workplace communications app are ranking channels, setting strict response hours, and experimenting with video clips to replace meetings.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Slack users can also receive their own form of Wrapped by checking who sent the most messages in their workspace.\n\nIn the Sourcery interview, Grimm acknowledged that it was impossible to read every single Slack message sent across Anduril's channels.\n\n\"We're in like 14 time zones,\" Grimm said. \"They're just all day, every day, all the time.\"",

That's according to a support page published by the company, which outlines a new process to change the email or username used to identify your account.\n\nThe update on Google's account help page says certain account holders can now change their @gmail.com address without losing access to their data or services. The feature was first reported in the Google Pixel Hub Telegram group in a message that said the update is being gradually rolled out to users. As of Friday morning, the modified instructions were available on the Hindi version of Google's support page.\n\nThe support page suggests this option is currently only available in some regions, including Hindi-speaking areas.\n\nAccording to a translated version of the Hindi support page, the new email must end in @gmail.com, and it can only be changed up to three times. Once the address has been changed, it's irreversible.\n\nTo make the change, you would visit your Google Account page, click \"Personal Info,\" and go to the \"Email\" section, according to the Telegram message.\n\nIt's unclear when it will roll out more widely, and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. As of Friday morning, the English support page said usernames ending in @gmail.com usually can't be changed.\n\nOnce the change is made, the Hindi page said, your old Gmail address will be used as an alias to receive emails. You can reuse your old Google account email address at any time, but you can't create a new Gmail address for the next 12 months.\n\nYou can sign in to Google services like Gmail, YouTube, Google Play, or Drive with your old or new email address.",

    "description": "From live shopping startup Whatnot to AI music platform Suno, meet the creator economy startups that raised massive deals in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The creator economy is riding an AI-fueled high.\n\nIn 2025, eight startups building artificial intelligence tools to automate the content creation process each announced at least $50 million in funding — a combined $1.2 billion — from venture capital and private equity investors.\n\nSynthesia, a generative AI video startup based in London, confirmed its $180 million funding round in January, while ElevenLabs, a text-to-voice startup, closed a $180 million Series C round. Other AI startups, like Moonvalley, Krea, and Higgsfield, also announced sizable investments this year.\n\nWhile AI is dominating investor interest, the topic still carries friction within the creator economy. Some of these AI startups, which offer features such as human-like avatars, run the risk of posing a threat to content creators themselves. Influencer marketing, still the primary financial engine of the creator economy, has yet to reach a consensus on how and when AI should be utilized.\n\nTop creators aren't sitting by idly for AI to take over. YouTuber MrBeast and his team initially sought to raise $200 million earlier this year at a $5 billion valuation, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The MrBeast team declined to comment on the fundraise.\n\nIt's not just AI that's attracting giant checks from VCs.\n\nSocial commerce startups building live shopping and affiliate marketing platforms are also raking in funding. Whatnot, a platform where people sell on stream in categories like fashion and collectibles, such as Pokémon Cards or Labubus, raised a total of $490 million across two later-stage rounds this year. The social shopping platform was most recently valued at $11.5 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, ShopMy, an affiliate marketing platform, continues to gain market share in the influencer marketing space. The startup raised a total of $147.5 million in funding this year.\n\nUS social commerce sales are expected to cross $100 billion next year, according to estimates from EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. The category is gaining steam in the US, fueled in part by the growth of TikTok Shop.\n\nThis year's fundraising blitz for creator AI and social commerce startups follows similar buzz for the categories in 2024 when investors threw money at startups like Captions, Flip, and OpusClip. Several startups in those business areas, including ElevenLabs and ShopMy, raised money two years in a row.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 2025 fundraising data from PitchBook and other industry sources to highlight the biggest creator industry investment rounds from the year. We're highlighting 13 startups that raised $50 million or more in 2025; combined, their funding crossed $1.9 billion. We focused on companies whose products significantly impact the businesses and content creation processes of creators and their partners.\n\nHere are 13 creator economy startups that raised some of the largest rounds in 2025, in alphabetical order:",

    "fullText": "Losing a parent is difficult enough. But on top of planning a funeral and taking care of final expenses, surviving family members have to handle the belongings left behind, a Herculean task that leaves little space to grieve.\n\nMy mom, Melinda Nicholson, is doing things differently.\n\nFor the past few years, she has been practicing Swedish death cleaning to help me navigate her eventual passing, from organizing important documents to passing down heirlooms. It sounds grim, but it's bringing us both a surprising amount of peace and comfort.\n\nBeing a police officer for 21 years took a toll on my mom's health, forcing her into early retirement. While she does not have any life-threatening diagnoses, her experiences showed her the fragility of life and that time waits for no one.\n\n\"I was 15 when my daddy died,\" my mom recalls. \"I remember there was so much he left behind, and after he was gone, it felt like vultures swooping in to take whatever they wanted. I didn't get to keep much that belonged to him.\"\n\nOne item she wishes she had inherited from her dad was a pearl-handled revolver, but it disappeared following his death. She recently found several of his belongings among her mother's possessions, including a watch, a Shriners' ring, and his military photos.\n\nHer mom handled her dad's affairs. In 2001, it was her turn to become the custodian of a life that had been left behind.\n\nHaving gone through the process herself, she knew what a burden it could be and didn't want to leave that burden for me or my sister.\n\nMy mom has been going through boxes and closets gradually and has developed a system. She offers items to me or my sister first. I've been given her anniversary ring from my dad, a ring from her parents, dishes, and family photos. My sister has also received jewelry, dishes, and a water pitcher. She has given photos and trinkets to her cousins and grandchildren.\n\nShe donates unwanted items to charity organizations. Other items, such as an old time-keeping book from a now-defunct mill where her mother used to work, were donated to the county history museum.\n\nSwedish death cleaning led both of us down our family history's rabbit holes as we sorted items together. Photos from multiple generations triggered memories and stories. I got a family history lesson and felt closer to those who came before me, even people I never met.\n\nIt's also given us opportunities to spend more time together, talking about things that rarely come up in everyday conversations. It's comforting to know that I'll have special reminders of her for the rest of my life, things that won't get tossed to the wayside in the aftermath of her passing.\n\nTo anyone considering Swedish death cleaning, Melinda offers advice: \"Don't wait, even if you think you're in good health. Start with a single box, then a closet, then a whole room, just don't wait.\"",

    "title": "Airlines are canceling flights ahead of a winter storm. Here's what to do if your flight is delayed or canceled.",
    "description": "As a snow storm heads toward the New York City area, airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights.",
    "fullText": "A winter storm expected to hit the Northeast is causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for areas around New York City, extending into Connecticut and New Jersey. The service expects heavy snow accumulations between six and nine inches.\n\nAbout 1,400 flights in the US have been canceled, as of 2:20 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Over 5,100 US flights have been delayed, per the service.\n\nAffected travel hubs, including New York's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports, have begun issuing weather warnings.\n\nSome airlines have begun offering solutions to travelers affected by the storm. JetBlue, Delta, and Southwest have all waived fare differences for those changing flights from airports around the New York metropolitan area.\n\nThe delays and cancellations come during a high-density travel period around the winter holiday. AAA projected that 8.03 million Americans would fly domestically between December 20 and January 1.\n\nHere is the best advice for what to do if your flight is disrupted.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, there is no law requiring US airlines to compensate passengers for disruptions caused by uncontrollable events, such as weather. That also includes air traffic control delays.\n\nThe only rule carriers must follow is to refund customers in the event of cancellations, even for non-controllable events. And that does not mean travel credits or vouchers — it must be cash, and includes any add-ons, such as bags or seats.\n\nBut carriers do not owe meals, hotel rooms, or financial compensation for storm-related cancellations or delays — because the cause is the weather, not the airline.\n\nPassengers are still entitled to a refund or rebooking on the same airline, but carriers are not required to provide additional accommodations or rebook on another airline.\n\nIf you choose to travel but your flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline for the reason — ideally in writing — so you know what you're entitled to. Airlines have different policies for disruptions they control, like crew or maintenance issues.\n\nThe DoT's Airline Customer Service Dashboard — launched in 2022 — shows what the 10 largest US airlines promise in those cases, including rebookings, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWhen a flight delay or cancellation is announced, expect people to flock to the nearest customer service line for assistance, and for the phone lines to clog.\n\nWait times can be painfully long, and the best alternatives will likely go quickly. However, some airlines offer the option to rebook on their website or mobile app and waive any fees, making it sometimes easier to make changes online than in person.\n\nIf all available options are exhausted, have a plan B, such as waiting to speak with a live agent, contacting the airline through social media, or booking a hotel for the night.\n\nDirect messaging on Facebook or Twitter can actually serve as a virtual placeholder, and you may hear back via chat before speaking to a live agent.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nFor controllable delays or cancellations that result in a customer waiting at least three hours for a new flight or requiring an overnight stay, several airlines will offer meal or hotel vouchers.\n\nCarriers offering both are Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines, per the DoT dashboard.\n\nFrontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of an overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nFor US airlines not listed on the dashboard, or in cases where the disruption is uncontrollable (like because of a winter storm), or if the compensation is unclear, simply ask.\n\nIt never hurts to request a meal or hotel during flight disruptions, and you might get lucky with a goodwill gesture from the carrier.\n\nSeveral major banks offer credit cards that come with travel insurance, like Chase's Sapphire Reserve or American Express' Platinum Card. Both offer trip protection, meaning customers who purchased their flight with that specific card can reap the benefits.\n\nFor example, in the case of a major storm system, it's likely many passengers will end up stranded in random cities across the US.\n\nHowever, banks with travel insurance included can reimburse cardholders for unexpected expenses outside their control, including hotel, meal, and transportation costs.\n\nTravel insurance does not apply in all circumstances, like short delays, so be sure to check your policy before making a claim — but it also doesn't hurt to make the claim anyway, even if the answer is no.\n\nDuring the holidays, it's easy to lose sight of your purpose — seeing friends and family or simply getting away from home for a few days.\n\nHowever, delays and cancellations are inevitable. Don't spend all day sitting around waiting — give yourself a cut-off time. Once that moment passes, consider alternative means of getting to your destination, such as driving or taking a bus or train (which may also be covered by travel insurance).\n\nIf you are stuck in another city and have no other option but to stay in a hotel or wait at the airport, decide how you want to spend your time and make a plan.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2023 and has been updated.",

    "description": "Every holiday season, Tom Cruise sends a white chocolate coconut bundt cake to a group of famous friends. The cake is available on Goldbelly for $140.",
    "fullText": "Karen Doan, the self-taught baker behind the famous cake, revealed during a 2021 interview with Spectrum News 1 that Holmes, who was married to Cruise from 2006 to 2012, had learned about Doan's Bakery from Diane Keaton while they were working on the 2008 film \"Mad Money.\"\n\n\"When Tom and Katie had a big party at their new home in Beverly Hills, we did all the cakes,\" Doan said. \"They loved it.\"\n\nCruise and Holmes' marriage didn't last, but his relationship with Doan's Bakery has continued for over a decade.\n\n\"This has become so popular that I would say when the phone rings, 80% of the people, that's what they want,\" Doan said about the coconut cake in 2021.\n\nWhether it's a bouquet of flowers from Beyoncé or some Meghan Markle marmalade, the A-list loves to show off their exclusive gifts on Instagram. Celebrities, they're just like us!\n\nThe \"Tom Cruise Cake\" is no different. Stars like Mindy Kaling and Glen Powell have posted pictures of their cakes, and the famous dessert is a frequent discussion on the talk show circuit. Celebrity gossip blogs even publish lists detailing which celebrities — including Jon Hamm, the Fanning sisters, and Angela Bassett — make the cut every year.\n\nThe cake itself has also won high praise. Kirsten Dunst told Graham Norton in 2016 that it was the \"best coconut cake I've ever had in my life,\" and Tom Hanks called it \"off-the-scale fantastic\" during a 2023 video for Mythical Kitchen. The actor loves the cake so much that he said it would be one of the dishes he'd want for his last meal on earth.\n\nI don't think I've ever tried a cake with so much hype. Clearly, it had a lot to live up to.\n\nI ordered the cake on December 18 and selected two-day shipping, which was an additional $35. There were also options for five-day delivery ($20) and six-day delivery (free). Unfortunately, due to high demand, you now need to join a waitlist for the cake on Goldbelly, although those in LA can still purchase it from Doan's Bakery for the much cheaper cost of $66.\n\nThe dessert, which ships nationwide, was delivered frozen with dry ice. The cake itself was individually wrapped in plastic, topped with a bright-green bow, and tucked inside a Doan's Bakery box.\n\nThe hefty 10-inch cake — which serves 12-16 people and weighs 3 pounds — can last in the refrigerator for up to five days or in the freezer for four months.\n\nCobie Smulders told Jimmy Fallon in 2019 that she'll \"slowly chip away\" at the dessert until March.\n\nWith its generous dusting of coconut flakes, the bundt cake makes for an angelic and festive centerpiece. But, at first, it was hard to appreciate the flavor.\n\nThis is already a dense and buttery cake, and it hadn't fully defrosted after 24 hours in the fridge. Paired with the cream cheese frosting, the texture was really heavy. My parents and I weren't super impressed, but we decided to hold our opinion and give the cake another day to fully defrost.\n\nThis is definitely a maximalist cake — something Doan said was always part of her ethos.\n\n\"I don't skimp on ingredients,\" she said during the Spectrum News 1 segment in 2021. \"Everyone says, 'Less is more, Karen,' because I want to put more white chips. I want to put more coconut!\"\n\nI'm glad she didn't listen when she created this cake recipe, especially when it came to the white chocolate chunks. Their texture adds just a hint of delicious crunch to the cake, and there's a warmth to the flavor that helps cut through the intense punch of sweetness. The toasted flakes are also a nice touch, adding depth without giving each bite an overwhelming coconut flavor.\n\nWhen I woke up for breakfast one morning this week, I found myself craving another slice of the cake. It had surprisingly grown on me. My parents agreed, although they're not convinced it's worth the price.\n\n\"I'd eat it again, if someone sent it as a gift,\" my dad said.",

    "fullText": "A turbulent year for air travel isn't over yet.\n\nSnow and rainstorms hit multiple states on both coasts on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and are now heading for the Northeast, including New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Travellers are now having a difficult time getting home as major airports see mass delays and cancellations.\n\nAccording to the \"Misery Map,\" published by FlightAware, which tracks real-time flight disruptions, there have been over 1,000 delays and more than 350 cancellations across the largest US airports as of 6:45 p.m. ET on Friday.\n\nHere's a look at the latest flight disruptions, and when you may expect to fly if your flight has been canceled.\n\nThe storm that first hit the Midwest is coming for the East Coast. New York City is set to see the most snow it has seen in years, since the last time it saw at least 4 inches of snow was January 2022. New Jersey and upstate New York will see similar weather conditions.\n\nThe NYC Emergency Management said in a press release that \"snow is expected to develop Friday afternoon and intensify into steady, accumulating snow Friday night.\" The National Weather Service has forecast 3 to 7 inches of snow with locally higher amounts possible.\n\nAccording to FlightAware, JFK International Airport is experiencing 369 cancellations, with 210 on Friday alone. The situation at Newark Liberty International Airport is also not optimistic, with 244 cancellations and counting.\n\nBased on the Misery Map, flights from airports around NYC to Chicago, Detroit, and Denver are seeing the highest number of delays and cancellations.\n\nThe West Coast is slowly recovering from an exceptionally wet Christmas.\n\nOver the past two days, most residents of California have received at least one weather warning as an atmospheric river accompanied by high winds, floods, and mudslides hit the Golden State. The NWS said that this Christmas season is the wettest one Los Angeles has experienced in 54 years.\n\nThe San Francisco International Airport said that 153 flights had been delayed on Friday morning due to windy conditions. To make matters worse, the police briefly shut down Terminal 1 due to a \"suspicious package,\" but then reopened it without explanation. By midday, FlightAware reports that a total of 381 flights from SFO have been delayed.\n\nAccording to the Misery Map, flights from the Los Angeles International Airport to Seattle, Salt Lake City, Denver, and the East Coast are all experiencing disruptions. FlightAware counted a total of 283 delays and 41 cancellations.\n\nThe disruptions come at the end of a tough year for air travel.\n\nHigh-profile plane accidents, including when an American Airlines Flight crashed into a Black Hawk helicopter, and the firing of hundreds of FAA employees by the White House DOGE office, triggered a newfound fear of flying among some Americans earlier this year.\n\nThe subsequent government shutdown also led to flying snags this year, as air traffic controllers who were left without pay called in sick, and some airports were paralyzed.",

The Cold Snap update brings multiple seasonal events, a new Snowfall map condition, and plenty more for fans to sink their teeth into. Among the fresh additions is the Goalie Raider Deck--the game's second battle pass--which contains a smorgasbord of cosmetics, gear, items, and even Raider Tokens that can be used toward premium purchases in the shop.\n\nThe Goalie Deck is free for all players, so you won't need to purchase access to these rewards with premium currency. Instead, you'll simply need to work toward completing daily Feats that provide you with Creds, then use those to unlock your preferred items from the deck. This should prove fairly easy to do for most players, as you can complete up to three Feats per match, and you'll even get additional bonus Creds for the first five Feats you finish in a day.\n\nPerhaps the best news about the Goalie Deck, however, is that it's a permanent reward track. Unlike battle passes in other games, this deck will stick around forever, meaning you can unlock what you want from it whenever you'd like. With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.\n\nIf you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time.
