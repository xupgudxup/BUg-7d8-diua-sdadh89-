    "description": "The Canes’ hot 11-2 start has given reason for optimism towards a potential run to the NCAA Tournament.",
    "fullText": "The Jai Lucas era for Miami Hurricanes basketball is 13 games in. After non-conference play, UM has compiled a record of 11-2. With a completely new roster, the 2025-26 Canes have already surpassed the win total from the disastrous 2024-25 season, in which Miami went 7-24.\n\nA group, mostly comprised of former Florida high school stars, has injected new life into this once-dormant program. Even though it’s still early, it is hard not to be encouraged about this mostly stress-free start to this season. Yes, teams don’t show their true colors until conference play begins, but this squad has been rocking.\n\nFormer Indiana big man Malik Reneau has risen to expectations, acting as the team’s main option and being the star of this season’s team. His sidekicks include the board-collecting Ernest Udeh and young freshman Shelton Henderson, who has already taken steps towards being a star at this level.\n\nThe backcourt duo of Tre Donaldson and Tru Washington has coalesced to a tee. Both have brought big-game experience, aggressiveness, lots of scoring, and shutdown defense. Their play styles have matched harmoniously. Timotej Malovic, nicknamed “Threemo,” has provided much-needed shooting. Freshman Dante Allen has shown flashes of being a great floor general, although he hasn’t played since late November thanks to an injury.\n\nFellow Euros, Salih Altuntas and Noam Dovrat have provided solid minutes off the bench. The potential is there. The talent and skill are the best the program has seen in years. There is some legitimate depth. Not to mention, Miami has also picked up two quality wins over Georgetown in the ESPN Events Invitational and against Ole Miss.\n\nThe Ole Miss victory back on December 2 was the program’s first true road win since a victory at Notre Dame in January of 2024. Although postseason predictions are still too early to make calls on, this Miami team looks to have all the ingredients needed to make the NCAA Tournament.\n\nIf this team were to accomplish that goal, it would be regarded as one of the greatest single-season turnarounds in college basketball history. As of now, it doesn’t sound too outlandish. The many pairs of eyeballs surrounding the college hoops world have taken notice of Miami’s fast start, as Lucas’ squad is getting a hint of consideration for being regarded as a Top 25 team.\n\nIn the recent week 8 poll, UM has received four votes, and they could soon make the national rankings with a solid start to ACC play. Not only are the intangibles there, but the desire and grit are as well. The team has also been given more motivation, following tragic news.\n\nOn December 19, it was revealed that key backup forward and Miami native Marcus Allen was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. No question, it’s a devastating blow to the rotation. However, when the adversity of life has hit teams across sports, it has always brought the players closer together. Miami will be no different.\n\nThe Canes rank well in several team statistical categories. Offensively, UM is one of the most balanced and highest-scoring teams in Division 1. Nationally, they rank 17th in total points (1,163), seventh in both field goals (431) and field goal percentage (.523), sixth in assists (259), and 37th in offensive rebounds (174).\n\nLucas has installed an approach that is similar to Dean Smith, the former legendary head coach from North Carolina. There isn’t one player who takes up most of the shots. While Malik Reneau averages 13.4 shot attempts per game, Tre Donaldson, Tru Washington, and Shelton Henderson have all gotten their looks and touches.\n\nEveryone gets the ball at some point, and everyone gets to shoot. This team doesn’t depend on the three-ball and prefers to play inside-outside. They have only attempted 268 shots from beyond the arc, ranking 250th amongst all Division 1 teams.\n\nHowever, they have shot it decently, ranking 74th in three-point shooting percentage (.366). On the defensive end, the Canes have wreaked havoc on the opposition. They are 30th in the country in total rebounds (530). Opponents have only been able to shoot at 40.1 percent, which ranks 312th in the nation.\n\nOpponents have also shot a dreadful true shooting percentage of .499. UM has only allowed 880 points through the first 13 games, ranking their opponents’ scoring total at 238th in all of college basketball. Miami has accumulated 195 total turnovers, which is inside the top 40. Needless to say, this team does many things well.\n\nWhile one can look at Miami’s schedule and see a slate filled with smaller local schools, the coaches and players have laid the foundation for a potential run through the ACC this season. There are a few big issues that have popped up. The most consistent one has been the team’s inability to shoot consistently from the foul line.\n\nAs of now, Miami ranks 327th in the country, shooting at a woeful 66 percent clip from the charity stripe. The only other power conference team that is below them is Cincinnati from the Big 12 (.637). They also need to be a bit better when guarding the perimeter.\n\nOpponents are shooting 34 percent from beyond the arc against the Hurricanes. Several players, such as North Florida’s Kamrin Oriol, BYU’s Kennard Davis Jr., Georgetown’s Caleb Williams, and Bethune-Cookman’s Jakobi Heady, have all put on great shooting exhibitions against UM.\n\nStill, the team’s performance has been solid and thrilling. Each player has stood out and shone. Dunk parties have been held at the Watsco Center. Dominating outings have been enjoyed by the sparse but growing crowds during home games.\n\nThe team’s chemistry and vibes couldn’t be better. The overall position the team is in has brought lots of passion, energy, and excitement. It has been a welcome change considering how last season went. Miami opens up ACC play against the 7-6 Pitt Panthers next Tuesday at home.",

    "description": "Memories of Tennessee's 2021 appearance in the Music City Bowl brought Jalin Hyatt to Josh Heupel's mind. Here's why he thought Hyatt was relevant.",
    "fullText": "NASHVILLE – Jalin Hyatt wasn’t an obvious talking point when coach Josh Heupel addressed the Tennessee football team before Music City Bowl practice.\n\nBut memories of the Vols’ last trip to this bowl steered Heupel toward Hyatt, the 2022 Biletnikoff Award winner, as one of his favorite examples of persistence paying off for a player.\n\n“A lot of times in December you get a glimpse of where (young players) are continuing to grow,” Heupel said on Dec. 26 at Montgomery Bell Academy, where UT is holding on-site bowl practices.\n\n“Last time we were here, Jalin Hyatt was a great example. That’s a story we actually talk to our team about pretty much every single year. It’s one that I shared with our young guys.”\n\nNo. 23 Tennessee (8-4) plays Illinois (8-4) in the Music City Bowl on Dec. 30 (5:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) at Nissan Stadium.\n\nFreshmen will play key roles after notable players opted out to prepare for NFL draft workouts. Heupel told them about Hyatt’s breakout Music City Bowl performance that led to stardom the following season.\n\nIn 2021, Hyatt had a disappointing sophomore season under Heupel, then UT’s first-year coach. Hyatt suffered a concussion, lost his slot receiver position, struggled in the new offense and lost his confidence.\n\nBut Hyatt kept working and finally got an opportunity in the Music City Bowl. He caught a 31-yard pass to set up a UT touchdown. And with 1:35 remaining in the game, he caught a TD pass from Hendon Hooker to send it into overtime.\n\nTennessee ultimately lost 48-45 to Purdue. But the Vols amassed 666 yards of total offense, and Hyatt proved that he was ready to step into the spotlight.\n\nIn 2022, Hyatt adopted an intense workout routine, increased his film study and caught a school-record 15 TD passes to win the Biletnikoff Award, given to the best receiver in college football. He was selected by the New York Giants in the third round of the 2023 NFL Draft.\n\nIt started with his performance in the Music City Bowl.\n\n“That guy that had a little bit of an up-and-down during the course of the (2021) season,” Heupel said. “But his focus, his preparation, his work habits during the month of December were dramatically different (leading up to the Music City Bowl).\n\n“We expected him to play really well when we got here. He obviously did, and that was the springboard to his (2022) season.”\n\nHeupel said Hyatt serves as an example to players at any position. But his breakout certainly applies to UT’s situation at wide receiver.\n\nChris Brazzell, the SEC’s leading receiver, opted out of the Music City Bowl to prepare for NFL draft workouts. Freshmen Radarious Jackson and Travis Smith will replace him against Illinois.\n\nIf they play well, it could lead to a starting role in the 2026 season.\n\n“(We) expect both of them to play at a really high level,” Heupel said. “Those are guys we had a lot of trust in heading into the season based on what they had done during spring ball, their maturity, their summer prep.\n\n“Both of them got nicked up at different points during the season but finished in a great way.”\n\nJackson has seven catches for 72 yards this season, and he missed four games due to injury. Smith has three catches for 29 yards, and he missed six games due to injury.\n\nQuarterback Joey Aguilar said both freshmen have worked into the primary rotation during bowl practices. They joined Braylon Staley, the SEC Freshman of the Year, and Mike Matthews.\n\n“(Jackson and Smith) got a lot of reps at practice (during the season), but a lot of team reps and first-team reps are a little different. They’ve adapted well,” Aguilar said. “They know what they’re doing, and they’re out there competing for a spot.”\n\nThe Music City Bowl provides an opportunity for Jackson and Smith to get a headstart in the 2026 competition at wide receiver.\n\nAssuming Staley and Matthews return, one starting spot will be up for grabs. And UT would like to expand the rotation beyond three receivers.\n\nFive-star signee Tristen Keys, arguably the No. 1 receiver in the 2026 class, will enroll at Tennessee in January. Tyreek King, a four-star signee from Knox Catholic, also will join the mix.\n\nJoakim Dodson is another option after he caught two passes as a freshman this season.\n\nAdam Sparks is the Tennessee football beat reporter.

    "title": "5 reasons for optimism for the Chargers against the Texans in Week 17",
    "description": "Here is why the Los Angeles Chargers should be able to secure the win in Week 17.",
    "fullText": "The Chargers will be seeking to put some demons to rest in a rematch of the 2024 AFC Wild Card against the Texans on Saturday.\n\nHere's a few reasons to be optimistic about LA's chances to get it done.\n\nHampton has been ramping his way up into the impact player the Chargers hoped he would be when they made him their first-round selection in April, taking 16 carries for 85 yards and a touchdown last week. He has forced a missed tackle on 32.7 percent of his rushing attempts this season, the only player to hit a mark over 30 percent with at least 100 carries. Houston allows only 96.2 rushing yards per game, fourth in the league, but Hampton's ability to churn through tacklers and fight for extra yards could result in a crucial contribution from the rookie.\n\nCJ Stroud has thrown all 6 of his interceptions this season against zone coverage, compared to only three touchdowns. 13 of his touchdowns have come against man coverage, the most in the NFL without throwing an interception. Los Angeles has played zone 82.9 percent of the time this year, generating 14 of their 17 interceptions as a defense from zone looks. The Texans have struggled on offense at times this season, so getting a turnover or two to put the Chargers offense in an advantageous position could prove to be the difference on Saturday.\n\nDespite both riding win streaks into Saturday's game, these two teams have to be feeling a bit different about their recent performances. LA beat the Cowboys 34-17, their second-highest point total of the season and Justin Herbert's fourth 300-yard game of the year. Dallas scored all 17 points in the first half before the Chargers' defense shut the lights off in the second half and closed the door on the win. Houston, meanwhile, needed a Derek Stingley Jr. pick-six to sneak by the 2-13 Raiders 23-21 after allowing rookie running back Ashton Jeanty to compile 188 scrimmage yards and two touchdowns. Stroud had a lower QBR and passer rating than Geno Smith, who has struggled all season as the Raiders quarterback.\n\nHerbert has been pressured 252 times this season, more than any other quarterback in the NFL, but he managed to avoid being sacked all game against the Cowboys for the first time in nearly a year, dating back to Week 17 of 2024. Herbert leads the league in QBR (81), pass yards (1,135) and passing touchdowns (3) on plays where the defense records a pass rush win, defined by ESPN as a defeated block within 2.5 seconds. Against a Texans pass rush that has Danielle Hunter and Will Anderson Jr. in the top ten of the league leaderboard in sacks, the Chargers will need Herbert to keep that pace.\n\nPhillips now owns the Chargers' single-season record for special teams tackles with 23, which also leads the league entering Week 17. With three tackles last week, he held the Cowboys to an average starting field position of the 24.7-yard line, their lowest of the season. Houston is tied for 12th in the league in kickoff return average, but another performance like last week's from Phillips could keep the Texans tied down and force the offense to beat the streaking Chargers defense.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: Chargers' path to beating the Texans: Week 17 optimism",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks will be without a couple of key pieces in their effort to stay atop the NFC against the Carolina Panthers.\n\nSeahawks head coach Mike Macdonald announced they would be without starting left tackle Charles Cross and safety Coby Bryant. The Panthers’ game is the second straight game Cross will miss after suffering a hamstring injury, which might put an end to his regular season, against the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nJosh Jones, a versatile offensive lineman who signed with the Seahawks in the offseason, will start in Cross’ place for the second week in a row. Jones played his first significant snaps for the Seahawks last week against the Los Angeles Rams and did not allow a sack against a hungry Rams’ pass rush.\n\nSeahawks game statuses for Week 17: \n\nOut — Coby Bryant (knee) and Charles Cross (hamstring) \n\nEveryone else is good to go.\n\n— Dugar, Michael-Shawn (@MikeDugar) December 26, 2025\n\nThe Seahawks will once again be turning toward Ty Okada for help in the secondary with the loss of Coby Bryant. Bryant suffered a knee injury that held him out of the second half of the Rams game and did not practice at all this week.\n\nOkada has been instrumental for Seattle this season, providing relief when safety Julian Love missed time in the first half of 2025. He’s totaled 58 tackles and snagged his first career interception with an immaculate catch against the Washington Commanders.\n\nThe good news for the Seahawks is that Bryant and Cross are the only starters with injury woes after receiving positive news on Riq Woolen and Nick Emmanwori earlier this week. It’s starting to feel like 2013 again as the Seahawks head to Carolina with the NFC’s No. 1 seed on the line on Sunday.",

    "title": "Patience, Sabres Fans – World Junior Success Doesn't Guarantee Buffalo's Prospects A Successful NHL Future",
    "description": "The Buffalo Sabres will have four players at the 2026 IIHF World Junior Championship. But success at the World Junior tournament offers little guarantee prospects of NHL success. While World Junior glory would be great, the Sabres' youngsters need more time and patience to develop.",
    "fullText": "In more recent seasons, the Buffalo Sabres had more players at the annual IIHF World Junior Championship tournament. But it’s a measure of how things have changed for the Sabres that, in the 2026 World Juniors, only four Buffalo youngsters are involved. The leading teams in terms of involvement at the World Juniors are the Nashville Predators and Utah Mammoth, who each have seven players playing. And given where those teams stand in their development, they should have that many players involved.\n\nBut while the Sabres will have less of a footprint on this year’s World Junior tournament, there’s still reason for Buffalo fans to tune in. Whether it’s watching Team U.S.A. players and Sabres prospects Brodie Ziemer, Adam Kleber and Luke Osburn, or Team Czechia's Radim Mrtka, the Sabres will still have plenty of players taking part in this best-on-best tourney.\n\nThe reality of where the Sabres are in competitive cycle means that they should be expecting to have fewer players at the World Juniors down the road. There’s no direct correlation between where a team is competitively speaking and the number of World Junior players they have in any one season, but for a team like Buffalo, the organization needs to be more focused on the present than on the future.\n\nThus, even if the Americans do win gold at this year’s World Juniors and put Ziemer, Osburn and Kleber in the spotlight, when the holiday break is over, none of those players (nor Mrtka) will be immediate difference-makers at the NHL level. And that will be true of the quartet regardless of how things turn out in the next week-and-a-half. The World Juniors has a long history of players who were World Junior standouts, yet who couldn’t make that translate into NHL success.\n\nIdeally, it’s true you want all of your prospects to be needle-movers at whatever level they’re at in any point of their history. But that’s not realistic, and it’s probably unfair to prospects who are still learning what type of player they can be.\n\nFor A Christmas Present, Sabres Fans Need This More Than Anything Else Fans of the Buffalo Sabres could use more than a few presents this holiday season. But there's one thing Sabres fans crave more than run-of-the-mill holiday cheer – they're seeking genuine hope.\n\nRegardless of the hype around them, young players need the time, space and understanding to evolve and grow into the best version of themselves, and that may mean arriving at a level that some observers see as a disappointment. The prospect game is hit-and-miss, and even if the Sabres have some hits when it comes to players representing their homeland, that doesn’t mean those same players won’t be misses in hockey’s best league.\n\nSo when Sabres fans tune in to see how this year’s World Juniors plays out, they have to temper their expectations. This year’s tournament will be on home ice for the Americans, but that could increase the pressure on Buffalo’s three American players. But the best way to test those players is to put their feet into the fire and see how they respond.\n\nThe Time For New Sabres GM Kekalainen To Make A Trade Or Firing Happen In Buffalo Has Already Arrived New Buffalo Sabres' GM Jarmo Kekalainen can't be preaching patience with this Sabres group. Whether it's trading a star player or firing coach Lindy Ruff, Kekalainen must shake up the organization if Buffalo is to salvage their season.\n\nIt’s going to take more patience to see how these Sabres prospects deal with expectations, but it’s their progress once the spotlight of the World Juniors ends that will ultimately reveal more about where Buffalo’s up-and-comers are going to land as professional hockey players.\n\nGlory at the World Juniors would be great, but it isn’t the be-all and end-all. And the Sabres’ growth as a team will mean more to Buffalo fans than even a gold-medal result for the U.S. would be to them.",

    "fullText": "Micah Parsons isn't sugarcoating it. He is facing his greatest test.\n\nThe Green Bay Packers' superstar edge rusher noted that in the days after he suffered a season-ending ACL injury earlier this month.\n\nWhile Parsons immediately proclaimed he would \"rise again\" and that his goal is to return at the beginning of next season, his latest update this week further reveals his mindset as he begins his long recovery back.\n\n\"Two weeks in, I've accepted the pain and the reality of this journey,\" Parsons wrote on X Christmas Day. \"Some days are heavy, some days aren't but every day brings its own fight.\n\n\"My courage, my strength, and my mind have all been tested. Still, I won't stop. I won't quit until I'm back. I'm grateful God chose me.\"\n\nParsons suffered the noncontact ACL injury in the second half of the Packers' game against the Denver Broncos on Dec. 14. He had just broken through Broncos offensive linemen and had his eyes on quarterback Bo Nix. But as he was planting his left foot, he stopped in his tracks and grabbed his leg.\n\nParsons fell to the ground and needed assistance getting off the field.\n\nMicah Parsons suffers a non-contact knee injury the same quarter the Packers lose Christian Watson to a chest injury\n\noof. pic.twitter.com/IPOuEBjAhP\n\n— Christian D'Andrea (@TrainIsland) December 14, 2025\n\nThe Packers confirmed Parsons tore his ACL the next day.\n\nLosing Parsons: Packers’ Super Bowl hopes downgraded with the injury to star defensive player\n\nParsons has not had surgery to repair his torn ACL, Packers coach Matt LaFleur said earlier this week.\n\nBut LaFleur said surgery would be coming.\n\nAfter the injury, Parsons flew to the Dallas area for the birth of his third child. Parsons was expected to return to the facility Dec. 24.\n\nBefore the injury, Parsons was nearly unstoppable in his first season with the Packers. The Packers acquired the three-time All-Pro days before the season in a blockbuster trade with the Dallas Cowboys that shocked the NFL.\n\nThe 25-year-old lived up to the hype.\n\nA true game wrecker who faced double teams which seemed like every snap, Parsons would earn his fifth Pro Bowl nod, the only Packers representative.\n\nLate last month in a win over the Detroit Lions, Parsons recorded his 12th sack, becoming the only player in NFL history to have at least a dozen sacks in each of his first five years. Packers icon Reggie White previously had the record with four consecutive seasons.\n\nIn 14 games, Parsons finished with 12.5 sacks\n\nHe had three games with two or more sacks, including his first three-sack game of his career this season on Oct. 19 against the Arizona Cardinals.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Packers' Micah Parsons reflects on injury in heartfelt Christmas post",

    "fullText": "Welcome to Wrestling Inc.'s coverage of the final \"WWE SmackDown\" of 2025, coming to you from the Van Andel Arena in Grand Rapids, Michigan this December 26 evening! Heat up your Christmas leftovers, put on your new pair of cozy pajamas, and get ready for an action-packed card to play this spectacular year out.\n\nDrew McIntyre has had a less than jolly season after WWE Universal Champion Cody Rhodes invaded his home mere days before last week's December 19 episode of \"SmackDown.\" While McIntyre was absent from WWE programming following the home break-in and subsequent brawl, \"The Scottish Psychopath\" is back with a vengeance. With the lines between in-ring competition and out-of-ring animosity now blurred beyond recognition, just what will McIntyre do in order to get his revenge against Rhodes in this rivalry-turned-blood feud?\n\nSpeaking of feuds, The Miz is out to reclaim his honor after receiving a Ten-Knuckle Shuffle at \"Saturday Night's Main Event,\" courtesy of R-Truth and Joe Hendry! Grand Rapids will be chanting the name of the former TNA World Champion as he appears to take on the former WWE world titleholder in singles action. While this is looking to be a typical one-on-one affair, The Miz is notorious for bending the rules in order to come out with a win. Will the new-age Hendry be able to withstand the veteran Miz's underhanded tactics, or will Hendry's viral moments crumble under The Miz's tried-and-true tenacity?\n\nIn the vein of tried-and-true tenacity, United States Champion Ilja Dragunov is set to defend his title in yet another installation of his Open Challenge series. So far, he has defended his title against the likes of Tommaso Ciampa, J.D. McDonagh, both halves of Fraxiom, Carmelo Hayes, and others. Dragunov has mostly been able to steer clear of controversy and repeat challengers during his time as United States Champion, but recently defeated challengers Ciampa, Johnny Gargano, and Candace LeRae may not be done with him just yet. Who can Dragunov rely on to even the numbers, or will \"The Mad Dragon\" be faced with the impossible-to-win numbers game to end 2025?\n\nAll will be revealed when WWE's blue brand comes to life tonight, at 8PM Eastern, 7PM Central!\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "Kevin Vallejos didn't expect to be in the official UFC featherweight rankings the same year he debuted for the promotion.",
    "fullText": "Kevin Vallejos is in awe to see his name among the 15 best featherweights in the UFC.\n\nIt's not that the Argentine youngster doesn't believe in his potential, but he just didn't expect to enter the official UFC featherweight rankings in his first year with the promotion.\n\nVallejos (17-1 MMA, 3-0 UFC) made his first walk to the octagon in March and debuted with a first-round knockout win over veteran Seung Woo Choi. He followed up with two more wins, the most recent being a knockout of Giga Chidkaze earlier this month in the co-main event of UFC on ESPN 73. This streak was enough to get the 24-year-old a spot in the UFC rankings – which wasn't in his plans entering 2025.\n\n\"I'm very happy and satisfied with what I did this year,\" Vallejos told MMA Junkie in Spanish. \"It was a very complete year. It was a lot. It was a dream to start the year as a debutant and end it ranked. It's crazy. Honestly, I didn't expect this.\"\n\nVallejos' expectations were to get himself accustomed to the UFC bright lights, get a few wins and start positioning himself so he could then make a push toward the rankings in 2026.\n\n\"I was surprised to get No. 13 in the rankings. I thought I would be ranked 15th after beating Giga,\" Vallejos said. \"I sincerely was surprised to see me in the rankings because that wasn't in my plan for this year, to enter the top. I never thought about that. The plan was just to generate experience. But to get to the top so quick and be ranked 13th, it surprised me a ton.\"\n\nThe quick success proved to Vallejos that he's on the right path and beyond that, he's where he needs to be – home. Unlike many South American fighters, Vallejos has stayed with his original team rather than migrate to a bigger team in the U.S. He's very proud to be fighting out of Argentina, and 2025 just validated his stance on staying home.\n\n\"I'm at the level, and we're doing things well,\" Vallejos said when asked about his biggest lesson in 2025. \"A lot of people have to go live in another country to get the resources. I'm doing something different. I'm staying in my country, Argentina, where the country is not that well known, and we're not at the level culturally or technically like Brazil, United States or other countries. Yet, I do see we're doing well. I only leave to do camp, but I mainly stay here and continue to learn and get tools. I still have the idea of doing all my camp here. That's something I'm looking at and more this coming year. We already did something similar. I only leave (to Brazil) a month-and-a-half. I continue to think about that.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared on MMA Junkie: UFC rookie surprised to enter rankings in 2025: 'It's crazy'",

    "fullText": "Amidst departures to the NCAA transfer portal and opt outs for the Citrus Bowl against the Michigan Wolverines, the Texas Longhorns received some positive news for the 2026 season on Friday when junior safety Jelani McDonald announced his return for his senior campaign.\n\nAt 6’2 and 199 pounds, McDonald has prototypical size and explosiveness for the position that could allow him to become one of the first safeties taken in the 2027 NFL Draft if he stays healthy and maintains his developmental trajectory.\n\nOut of Waco Connally, McDonald was a late riser in the 2023 recruiting class, receiving his offer from the Longhorns in October when he was committed to Oklahoma State. TCU also factored into McDonald’s recruitment, hosting him for an official and unofficial visit late in the process, but it was McDonald’s time on the Forty Acres in December that ultimately sealed his decision to spurn his father’s alma mater and signed with Texas.\n\nA triple jumper, high jumper, and basketball standout at Connally, McDonald played quarterback, wide receiver, and on defense in high school, allowing him to finish the cycle as a consensus four-star prospect ranked as the No. 74 player nationally and the No. 2 athlete, according to the 247Sports Composite rankings.\n\nThe athlete classification certainly fit McDonald, as it wasn’t clear whether he would grow into a linebacker in college even as he displayed the ability to play cornerback despite his height. As a freshman, McDonald m0ved between nickel back, linebacker, cornerback, and safety.\n\nWhile McDonald developed behind the scenes shuffling through positions to determine his future role, he played on three special teams units for the Horns as a true freshman, recording two tackles against Oklahoma State in the Big 12 Championship game.\n\nAs a sophomore, McDonald showed signs of becoming a rising star as he was thrust into playing time due to injuries, totaling 33 tackles, one tackle for loss, one interception, and one pass broken up with four starts over 14 games.\n\nMcDonald took another step forward as a full-time starter in 2025, leading the team in tackles with 73 (43 solo) thanks to late-season injuries sustained by redshirt senior safety Michael Taaffe and junior linebacker Anthony Hill Jr., notching four tackles for loss, three interceptions, three passes broken up, and a fumble return.\n\nWith McDonald returning, Texas has one starter back at the safety position with Taaffe exhausting his eligibility.",

Statistically, they have the worst red-zone D in the league this season.”\n\nThe Patriots are giving up a staggering 74% of touchdowns when opponents reach the red zone, making it the worst rate in the NFL.\n\nNew England will likely face a handful of powerful offenses in the postseason, and it won’t be able to compete if it doesn’t limit opposing teams to field goals.\n\nThe Patriots need to focus on improving their red zone defense over the next two weeks, especially as they face the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins, both of whom will be starting backup quarterbacks.\n\nWhy NFL Writer Would’ve Loved To See Myles Garrett On Patriots This Season",

He also forced a fumble and had a pass defensed in the win. The All-Pro is tied for the team lead with four interceptions and is the only player in the NFL to have at least four interceptions in each of the past three seasons. With Sunday’s performance, he became the first player in franchise history to have a forced fumble and an interception return for a touchdown in a game.\n\nRB Omarion Hampton had 85 yards rushing and a touchdown on 16 carries against the Cowboys, his most productive showing in three games since returning from a broken ankle. The rookie first-round pick from North Carolina has 516 yards on the ground and four total touchdowns in eight games. The Chargers will need to maintain offensive balance against the outstanding Texans defense.\n\nTexans DE Will Anderson Jr. vs. Chargers' offensive line. Improved pass protection kept QB Justin Herbert from being sacked in Dallas, which in turn allowed the offense to have one of its best performances of the season. However, the difference in quality between the Cowboys’ pass rush and what Anderson and company will bring is stark. Anderson has a career-high 11 1/2 sacks, and his 17 tackles for loss have been just as important in creating obvious passing downs. He has a tackle for loss in 10 of the past 11 games and all seven road games this season.\n\nTexans: RB Woody Marks and LB Azeez Al-Shaair are set to return after missing last week’s game with injuries. … LT Aireontae Ersery is listed as questionable and could miss the game with a thumb injury. … RT Trent Brown (ankle/knee) will not play.\n\nChargers: LT Jamaree Salyer (hamstring), return specialist Derius Davis (ankle), CB Benjamin St-Juste (shoulder) and rookie S R.J. Mickens (shoulder) have all been ruled out. … DL Teair Tart (groin) and RG Mekhi Becton (knee) are questionable. The Chargers estimated Becton would have been a full participant if they had practiced Thursday, which bodes better for his availability.\n\nThe Chargers won the most recent meeting in the regular season, leaving Houston with a 34-24 triumph on Oct. 2, 2022. … The Texans are facing the Chargers at SoFi Stadium for the first time. They came up with a 27-20 victory in September 2019 in their only other trip to Los Angeles since the Chargers left San Diego in 2017.\n\nThe Texans can clinch a playoff berth with a win or tie, or a loss or tie by the Colts. … Houston’s seven-game winning streak is the longest active streak in the NFL and tied for the second longest in franchise history behind a nine-game winning streak in 2018. … DeMeco Ryans is the first head coach in franchise history to win 10 games in three consecutive seasons. … Houston’s defense leads the NFL in yards (272.3) and points (16.6) allowed. … QB C.J. Stroud has had at least 200 yards passing in five straight road games. … RB Nick Chubb had 42 yards of offense last week and had 170 yards of offense and a touchdown in his only career game against the Chargers in 2021 while with Cleveland. … WR Nico Collins had 59 yards receiving last week for his eighth straight game with at least 55 yards receiving. He had seven catches for 122 yards and a touchdown in a playoff win over the Chargers last season. … The Chargers have won 11 games in consecutive seasons for the third time in franchise history (1979-80, 2006-07). … Jim Harbaugh is one of eight NFL head coaches to have multiple 11-win seasons with two different organizations. … The Chargers defense has 13 takeaways (three fumbles, 10 interceptions) in its past six games after getting eight through its first nine games. … Justin Herbert threw for 300 yards and two touchdowns against the Cowboys, his third game this season with multiple touchdowns passes and no interceptions. … WR Ladd McConkey needs two receptions to pass Keenan Allen (148) for most in Chargers history through a player’s first two seasons. … OLB Tuli Tuipulotu got his 13th sack of the season versus the Cowboys. He can become the fifth player in Chargers history with 14 or more in a season (Khalil Mack, Shawne Merriman, Leslie O’Neal, Lee Williams). … S Derwin James Jr. needs one sack to become the third player in NFL history with 600 tackles, 20 sacks and 10 interceptions in his first 100 games (Roquan Smith, Karlos Dansby).\n\nFacing two of the strongest rush defenses in the league, neither Omarion Hampton nor Woody Marks is likely to put up big numbers on the ground. Desperate fantasy owners with limited options will have to gamble that either tailback could make up for it as outlets in the passing game, as Marks was a tremendous receiver in college and Hampton has displayed good hands in his first season.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "fullText": "Despite a three-game win streak going into the Christmas break, the Florida Gators continue to drop in the ESPN College Basketball Power Index.\n\nLast ranked No. 11 following a win over George Washington, Florida fell one spot to No. 12 after decisive wins over Saint Francis and Colgate — both considered Quadrant 4 matchups by the NET rankings.\n\nThe Gators have a 19.0 overall BPI, up from 18.5 on Dec. 16. The offense improved to 8.8 (20th) from 8.0 (24th), while the Florida defense dipped to 10.2 (T-10th) from 10.3 (8th) in that time. ESPN projects Florida to go 21.5-9.5 overall — a 0.5-game increase — and 12.5-5.5 in conference play, a 0.4-game improvement.\n\n“The College Basketball Power Index (BPI) is a measure of team strength that is meant to be the best predictor of performance going forward,” ESPN explains. “BPI represents how many points above or below average a team is. Strength of Record (SOR) is a measure of team accomplishment based on how difficult a team’s W-L record is to achieve. Game predictions account for opponent strength, pace of play, site, travel distance, day’s rest and altitude, and are used to simulate the season 10,000 times to produce season projections.”\n\nFlorida remains the favorite to win the SEC, with 41% odds — up from 38.2% chance last week. The Vanderbilt Commodores (29%) and Tennessee Volunteers (21.3%) have the next best odds to win the conference, followed by Alabama Crimson Tide (15%) and Kentucky (14%). No other SEC team has better than a 4.4% chance to win the conference.\n\nFlorida's remaining strength of schedule is now 24th in the country, up from 44th before a three-game stretch against Quadrant 4 opponents. Florida still has Dartmouth on the schedule, and then it's all SEC from there. The Gators' strength of schedule (to date) ranks fifth in the country, while the non-conference slate ranks sixth nationally.\n\nFollow us @GatorsWire on X, formerly known as Twitter, as well as Bluesky, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Florida Gators news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Gators Wire: Florida Gators basketball ESPN BPI rankings Dec. 26",

    "fullText": "After two big deals, the pitching trade market recalibrated originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nHeading into the winter, Edward Cabrerawas one of the hottest names on the trade market. The Miami Marlins right-hander was widely viewed as the most likely rotation piece to move as the club looked to stockpile prospects during its rebuild.\n\nThat picture has shifted. And it may have happened faster than expected.\n\nAccording to Barry Jackson of the Miami Herald, both the Houston Astros and Baltimore Orioles are no longer pursuing Cabrera. The change appears less about the pitcher’s value and more about how quickly the starting pitching market recalibrated after the Baltimore Orioles made their move for Shane Baz.\n\nBaltimore had been linked to nearly every high-end starter available this offseason, both in free agency and on the trade market. That list included Cabrera, who fit the profile of a young, controllable arm with upside. The Orioles addressed that need last week by sending multiple prospects and a draft pick to the Tampa Bay Rays in exchange for Baz, a deal that provided immediate rotation help but also consumed significant prospect capital. Once that trade was completed, a second major trade for another high-upside starter became far less realistic.\n\nHouston followed a similar path.\n\nThe Astros entered the offseason with their rotation in flux after a wave of injuries in 2025, including Tommy John surgeries for Ronel Blanco, Hayden Wesneski and Brandon Walter, along with another elbow setback for Luis Garcia. With Framber Valdez nearing free agency, Houston moved aggressively to add a controllable arm, acquiring Mike Burrows in a three-team deal headlined by Brandon Lowe.\n\nThat move came at a cost. Outfielder Jacob Melton, one of Houston’s top prospects, and right-hander Anderson Brito were sent to Tampa Bay as part of the deal, for an organization that has traded heavily in recent years, parting with that level of talent likely reduced its ability to assemble another premium package for Cabrera.\n\nThe Marlins, meanwhile, have little incentive to rush. After years of flashes interrupted by injuries, Cabrera delivered his most complete season in 2025, posting a 3.53 ERA across a career-high 137 2/3 innings. He maintained a 25.8 percent strikeout rate while trimming his walk rate into single digits for the first time. A brief return from a September elbow sprain in the final week of the season helped ease some health concerns heading into 2026.\n\nCabrera remains under team control through 2028 and is projected to earn $3.7 million in arbitration. Miami has been clear it does not want to sell short, and with two aggressive suitors having already spent significant prospect capital, patience is now a viable strategy.",

    "fullText": "Travis Kelce addressed retirement speculation following the Kansas City Chiefs' Christmas night defeat to the Denver Broncos.\n\nThe Broncos won 20-13 over the Chiefs Thursday night at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Missouri.\n\nAccording to ESPN, Kelce, who played alongside third-string quarterback Chris Oladokun while starter Patrick Mahomes and backup Gardner Minshew were out with knee injuries, had five catches for 36 yards against the Broncos.\n\nTaylor Swift reads aloud a love letter from Travis Kelce in new docuseries: What it says\n\nThe Chiefs' loss comes amid talks about whether Kelce will announce if he is retiring or not after the season. He sparked rumors about a possible retirement in a pre-game interview with former NFL star Tony Gonzalez on Prime Video.\n\nIn the interview, Kelce said he feels motivated about his future but that he \"has to make the right decision for me.\"\n\n\"I got to hope that if I do want to come back, the Chiefs are willing to bring me back, so it's a two-way street on that,\" he said. \"But at the same time, at this point in this year, I'm just trying to finish out and give Chiefs Kingdom everything I got and go out there and do it with some of that flair.\"\n\nHe added that his brother, Jason Kelce, who retired from the NFL in 2024 after 13 years with the Philadelphia Eagles, is one of several people he's spoken to about the question of retirement.\n\n\"I'm asking myself, what was it for you that helped you find that answer?\" Kelce said.\n\nGonzalez, who retired from the NFL in 2013, replied with his reasons leading up to his retirement and told Kelce that he is \"one of the greatest tight ends of all time.\n\n\"You have won Super Bowl rings, you have been all pro, you have done stuff off the field, you have stuff waiting for you after the season's over -- the sky's the limit on what your next chapter is going to be,\" he said.\n\nIn a post-game press conference shared by KMBC-TV on YouTube, Kelce reflected on Thursday's game and said there were \"a whole lot of emotions.\"\n\n\"You've got everybody in the world watching you,\" he said. \"You get to go out there with the young guys on prime-time television. Young guys getting an opportunity to taste what this NFL life is like.\"\n\nWhen asked what was going through his head in what could have been his last game at Arrowhead stadium he talked about the fans that have supported him and the Chiefs.\n\n\"You only get a few of those moments where you just get to stand there and appreciate 60- to 70,000 Chiefs fans screaming for you.\"\n\nTaylor Swift wears engagement ring while cheering on Travis Kelce's college team\n\n\"I always embrace that moment, it's fun and hopefully I got everybody fired up for it,\" he added.\n\nIn terms of retirement, he said, \"I'll let that be a decision I'll make with my family, friends, the Chiefs organization when the time comes.\"\n\nKelce's teammate Chris Jones, defensive tackle for the Chiefs, said in a separate post-game interview shared on YouTube by KMBC-TV that he hopes Thursday's game wasn't his last with Kelce.\n\n\"We just have been through so much together,\" he said. \"He's been like a brother. I hope he gives it one more year. Just one more, man. Just one more.\"\n\nESPN said that Kelce's fiancé Taylor Swift was in a stadium suite cheering him on. His teammates Mahomes and Minshew were also there to show their support.",

    "description": "Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim was rewarded for a change in style and formation with a hard-fought win over Newcastle in the Premier League.",
    "fullText": "As a football idealist, Manchester United head coach Ruben Amorim has specific beliefs about how the game should be played - and the best way to win.\n\nBut his usual philosophy was not the one that brought the Christmas present of a 1-0 Premier League win over Newcastle.\n\nFor one thing, there was the formation switch.\n\nAmorim joked in September that not even the Pope could persuade him to change, but for the first time since he took charge 13 months ago, he fielded a back four.\n\nFor another, victory was achieved with 33.4% possession, their lowest in any game this season. It was United's lowest percentage of possession in a victory since the 29.4% they had when beating against Manchester City in January 2023.\n\nThey had nine shots at Old Trafford compared to Newcastle's 16. The visitors had 43 touches in their opponents' box. Amorim's men had 15.\n\nYet it was Manchester United who prevailed, thanks to a combination of Patrick Dorgu's first goal for the club - which was a sublime first-half volley from the edge of the area - and only a second clean sheet of the season.\n\nIt wasn't pretty. But even for Amorim, sometimes there are days when substance trumps style.\n\n\"Yes,\" was the unequivocal reply when asked if this was one of the 'most satisfying' wins of his, at times, tortuous 13 months in charge.\n\n\"The feeling is good. If you compared to other games, we suffered so much more today but in certain moments we put everything on the line.\n\n\"We are defending every cross. Especially if you see the second half, sometimes we managed to defend with a back six.\n\n\"We had so many games when we controlled the opponent so much better, but it is a good feeling to have a clean sheet. We suffered together. If we always have this spirit, we are going to win so many games.\"\n\nNewcastle boss Eddie Howe headed back to the north-east of England reflecting on yet another disappointing away performance. He admitted his side failed to turn their territorial advantage into the type and volume of meaningful chances that would have earned maximum points.\n\nBut for the home side, the outcome felt significant.\n\nLisandro Martinez and Ayden Heaven are at other ends of the experience scale.\n\nOne is a World Cup winner, albeit one just returning from the latest in a sequence of bad injuries. The other is a 19-year-old with 15 senior appearances under his belt – who has now extended the longest playing sequence of his first-team career to five games.\n\nPaired together in the middle of a revised back four, with Luke Shaw and Diogo Dalot as full-backs and Dorgu switched to the right side of Amorim's attack, Martinez and Heaven were immense.\n\n\"He [Martinez] is a guy with a lot of character,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"He is really good on the ball - and has won a World Cup, so he is used to that stress - but he showed today he is a top player.\n\n\"He is a small guy but today he did well against a team with tall players.\"\n\nThe sight of 5ft 9in Martinez leaping high to win a header against 6ft 6in Nick Woltemade in the first half was impressive.\n\nEven though there was an element of Amorim having to protect a player starting for the first time since February following his recovery from cruciate knee ligament surgery, there must have been concern when Martinez left the field two minutes from time and 20-year-old Tyler Fredricson came on in his place.\n\nFredricson did his job well. But he had Heaven with him to bring more solidity.\n\nIt is hard to believe when the former Arsenal youngster started against West Ham on 4 December, he was booked almost immediately and looked so shaky, it was almost a shock he lasted until half-time when he was replaced by Leny Yoro.\n\nIn the space of five games and three weeks, Heaven has advanced rapidly.\n\nHe was excellent in the defeat at Aston Villa on 21 December and followed that up with a performance of maturity against Newcastle that earned him the host broadcaster's man-of-the-match award.\n\nSo good has Heaven been that Amorim is warning Harry Maguire and Matthijs de Ligt, currently sidelined, they can't be certain of getting their places back when they are fit again.\n\nThat is significant in two ways. Firstly, De Ligt was, by common consent, United's best defender until a back injury ruled him out of the West Ham game. Maguire, meanwhile, is still waiting to learn whether United will offer him a new contract when his current one expires in the summer.\n\n\"I am really pleased with Ayden,\" said Amorim.\n\n\"You can feel that he is improving every game. He trained really well, which shows if you train well, it can help you play.\n\n\"If he continues to play like that, it is going to be really hard to take his place.\"\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe just made co-driver round the world proud with his performance at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France.",
    "fullText": "It takes a special kind of person to willingly strap oneself into a hatchback aimed at flying through the woods at high speeds. Rally drivers are madmen full-stop, but their shotgun-riding co-drivers are a whole different breed. Don’t discount the amount of driving know-how tucked away in those high-flying passenger seats, however. Hyundai Motorsports co-driver Martijn Wydaeghe recently took the wheel of a Hyundai i20 N Rally2 at the 2025 Rallye du Pays Vençois in France, making fellow co-drivers round the world beam with pride.\n\nWhile you might not be familiar with Martijn Wydaeghe, you have likely heard of his teammate Thierry Neuville. The two have been driving together since the 2021 season, with Wydaeghe co-driving during Neuville’s 2024 WRC Driver’s Championship effort. This year wasn’t as successful for last year’s champs, with Neuville finishing 5th overall in the standings. The results were largely tempered by two consecutive retirements at the Central Europe and Japan rallies towards the end of the season. The pair came back to win the final event of the year at Rally Saudi Arabia.\n\nWhile the automaker didn’t put Wydaeghe out in the proper Rally1 machine he’s used to riding in, the Belgian driver made his driving debut in the production-based Rally2 machine. He did previously get a go in the Rally1 car at the 2025 Goodwood Festival of Speed, however. I’m sure the co-driver-turned-wheelman wasn’t too upset about the more approachable platform for his first go either.\n\nWith co-driver Florian Haut-Labourdette alongside, Wydaeghe pushed the IXO-sponsored Hyundai through the 25-mile rally. His pace was undeniable, with Wydaeghe managing to take home a stage win on his very first attempt. The pair only managed to muster sixth place overall, but fans were more than happy to see Wydaeghe give it a shot. That said, I don’t think Neuville needs to be too worried about job security for the time being. Perhaps the WRC should look at a co-driver shootout event moving forward, though.\n\nYou Need a Torque Wrench in Your Toolbox\n\nTested: Best Car Interior Cleaners",

    "fullText": "Hello and welcome back to the Friday Feedbag where I will never serve you slop. This week is weird! It’s a Friday today and also day after Christmas, so many are either not working at all or have had the last one to two days off. To anyone who had to work both Christmas Eve and Christmas, you are the real MVP and I salute you. But, today feels like one of those “unearned” Fridays and so I’m reminded that many refer to the week between Christmas and New Year’s as a “liminal space.” A liminal space is a place or state of transition. It can be a physical place, like an airport, or a psychological/metaphorical place.\n\nThis being a Mariners blog, we’re gonna talk about Mariners Liminal Spaces. I’ll throw out a few and then y’all can have at it in the comments.\n\nThe Stadium Light Rail Station: An obvious pick, but it is a literal place of comings and goings, usually frantic at both the arrival at the game and during the exiting. But, if you’ve ever worked at the stadium and had to catch a lonely train home long after most of the crowd had gone home, you’ve probably spent more time here in this liminal space than you’d like, waiting for a train that should have been here 10 minutes ago and maybe never ends up coming.\n\nThe Left Field Gates at T-Mobile Park: Probably the entrance I have used most in my life and yet have never spent more than a passing few moments in after getting through security and then going up those iconic stairs to the main level concourse, or straight to the elevators to the 300 level (the elevators being another great liminal space!)\n\nThe 2021 Mariners season: The last season of the drought. They almost ended it that year, or came close like in 2014, 2016, and 2018 (well….kinda), but the momentum for the 2022 playoff run arguably started in August and September 2021. The 2021 season deserves its flowers for being a wildly fun year at the ballpark while many were still emerging from the pandemic and figuring out how to live in public again.\n\nOkay, let’s hear about your favorite or least favorite Mariners liminal spaces and have a great, if unearned for some, weekend!",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nBefore the NBA Cup tournament semifinals, the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder were 24-1 and had many fans and experts believing they could break the regular-season record for wins, set by the Golden State Warriors in 2016.\n\nHowever, after losing to the San Antonio Spurs for the third time this season on Christmas Day, the conversation has quickly shifted, as the Thunder have struggled to contain the young star power. San Antonio has been led by the 7'5\" French superstar Victor Wembanyama, who has gotten the best of OKC's seven-footer, Chet Holmgren, in the three matchups.\n\nOn Friday, ESPN NBA analyst Kendrick Perkins let it be known how he feels about the difference in play between the two giants.\n\nMore: Spurs record vs. Thunder: San Antonio extends winning streak over OKC with blowout victory on Christmas Day\n\n\"I gotta get on Chet (Holmgren) for a minute. He's playing soft in this matchup. Victor Wembanyama wants the smoke, he's ducking that smoke right now....Chet gotta come with it next time they play the Spurs, it might be in the postseason, but he gotta come with it, because right now the Spurs are pucking the Thunder and making them look soft,\" Perkins said on ESPN's 'Get Up'.\n\nIt is hard to disagree with Perkins' point when considering the players' stats against each other across the three games. Holmgren has averaged only 11.1 points per game, 7.3 rebounds, and one assist.\n\nWembanyama, on the other hand, has nearly averaged 20 points per game with 17.7, while grabbing 8.3 rebounds and 2.3 assists, while also disrupting the rhythm of SGA and the Thunder on defense.\n\nSteve Kerr admits the Warriors are a 'fading dynasty' amidst all the team's struggles\n\nVictor Wembanyama-Thunder beef, explained: Why Spurs star's 'ethical basketball' comments caused stir\n\nJalen Williams believes more reps will help solve the Thunder's back-to-back issues\n\nSan Antonio's balanced attack is turning heads during win streak\n\nAnthony Davis injury update is bad news for Dallas Mavericks on Christmas",

He made a move toward the basket with about 5 minutes to go in the first quarter and fell to the court with a torn Achilles tendon. The Pacers lost 103-91.\n\nA torn Achilles often requires an 8- to 10-month recovery.

    "fullText": "NBA insider reveals that trades are incoming in LA. Who could be on their way out? originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers are in absolutely putrid shape as of right now. They are 4-6 in the month of December and just got the brakes beaten off of them by the Houston Rockets on Christmas Day.\n\nFollowing the loss due to the same factors that have plagued this group for a month, JJ Redick ripped the team in their postgame press conference.\n\nMore: Lakers coach JJ Redick shreds team after Rockets loss\n\nRedick stated that there are too many players on the current roster who just don't care. If you look at the teams' performances as of late, Redick is not wrong.\n\nIf this team wants to not waste a single year of Luka Dončić's prime, changes need to be made and fast because, as presently constructed, this is not a championship-caliber roster.\n\nNBA insider Kevin O'Connor reported after the game that changes to the roster could be right on the horizon in LA.\n\nAfter the Rockets blew out the Lakers at home, Kevin O'Connor got on Twitter/X and laid out exactly what the plan is in LA after their abysmal showing through the month of December.\n\nTrades are coming in Los Angeles. Just a matter of who and when. Without them, this team has no chance of winning a title this year. That much is obvious after watching the Lakers as of late and listening to what JJ Redick said postgame.\n\n— Kevin O'Connor (@KevinOConnor) December 26, 2025\n\nThis leads you to think, if trades are incoming, who's on the way out the door?\n\nThere are many players on the roster not carrying their weight. Players that come to mind would quickly be players like Rui Hachimura, Jake LaRavia, Dalton Knecht, Maxi Kleber, and Gabe Vincent.\n\nAll of those players combined take up just north of $50 million in cap space. That is far too much money to go towards what is now essentially dead weight.\n\nWhile the Lakers don't have anywhere near the assets a team like OKC does, they are not without them completely. Between a mix of all those players' tradeable salaries and the picks the Lakers have to give, we could definitely see a move soon.\n\nDon't be shocked to see any or all of those players gone within the next month, as the Lakers have to take a real look in the mirror prior to the deadline.\n\nThe only issue for Los Angeles: teams know they're desperate, and as everyone knows, there's always going to be a Laker tax. We'll see if and how the team is able to improve its roster before the trade deadline.\n\nReport: Lakers 'circling back' on Heat's Andrew Wiggins\n\nWhat's behind the NBA's best bromance between Luka Dončić and Austin Reaves?\n\nLakers' Luka Doncic says he grew up idolizing this NBA legend\n\nLakers' LeBron James had alarming stat in Rockets loss",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich CEO Jan-Christian Dreesen is sometimes the boss, other times the mediator, and always a participant in the important discussions at the club.\n\nWith Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and Uli Hoeneß still playing prominent roles at the club on the supervisory board, Dreesen has been witness to sparks flying. When asked about Rummenigge recent statement of “FC Bayern doesn’t need less, but more Uli Hoeneß,” Dreesen could only concur.\n\n“Karl-Heinz and Uli are part of our supervisory board. We would be remiss if we didn’t seek their opinions and engage with them. I think other clubs envy us for their capacity. We have intensive exchanges, especially during transfer periods. Uli has strong opinions, and people can rally behind strong opinions. That’s part of what we do; it raises FC Bayern’s profile,” Dreesen told Welt am Sonntag (as captured by @iMiaSanMia). “Being on the board of FC Bayern is a wonderful and simultaneously challenging job. It’s perfectly normal and even necessary that there are different perspectives within a club. We’re all working together to achieve the best result for FC Bayern. That means we sometimes have different opinions, and we don’t always embrace each other from the start.”\n\nSome executive might be intimidated by two big players like Hoeneß and Rummenigge still having such big voices, but Dreesen seems happy to just roll with the punches. As you can probably tell, he like has had a lot of practice in dealing with just that.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…",

Veteran tight end Foster Moreau (knee) was placed on injured reserve with rookie backup Moliki Matavao coming up from the practice squad to replace him.\n\nAdditionally, a trio of wide receivers Chris Olave (back) and Mason Tipton (groin) plus kicker Charlie Smyth (illness) are questionable. Saints head coach Kellen Moore was optimistic about Olave's status and doesn't anticipate any restrictions for him on Sunday. Smyth's status is worth monitoring as the Saints don't have a backup kicker on the roster.\n\nFour other Saints players will be available on Sunday after being listed on the injury report this week. That group includes veteran defensive tackles Davon Godchaux (rest) and Nathan Shepherd (ankle/knee), swing tackle Asim Richards (ankle), and starting quarterback Tyler Shough (hip).\n\nWhat about the Titans? They already ruled out cornerback Marcus Harris (knee) plus outside linebacker Oluwafemi Oladejo (fibula) and wide receiver Bryce Oliver (knee), both of whom are on injured reserve. Another outside linebacker on IR, Ali Gaye (knee), is questionable to play after practicing fully this week. Cornerback Micah Robinson (illness) is also questionable. But the other seven players listed on the injury report are expected to be available when teams begin to warm up Sunday morning in Tennessee.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Saints Wire: Good news, bad news from Saints final injury report in Week 17",

    "fullText": "At this point, it's undeniable — the Oklahoma City Thunder have a San Antonio Spurs problem. With everybody watching from home, the reigning NBA champion stomached through a 117-102 loss to the same team for the third time in two weeks.\n\nThat's never happened before with this group. It's pretty unprecedented to see the Thunder lose three in a row against the same squad. For the first time since last season, OKC has gone from a win machine that's unbeatable at home to a vulnerable team that's looked a step slow.\n\nNo matter what happens for the rest of the regular season, the Thunder will have this stretch hover over their heads. Anytime you want to say they'll go back-to-back, the Spurs will be most folks' counterpoint. Much like OKC two seasons ago, San Antonio looks like a team ready to compete for a title right now.\n\nAfter the signature win, Victor Wembanyama talked about how the Spurs have solved the Thunder. The 21-year-old is universally seen as a top-five player when healthy. What should scare OKC is that he's played in a limited role off the bench. It's been the rest of San Antonio that has stepped up. From De'Aaron Fox to Stephon Castle to Keldon Johnson.\n\n\"Definitely learned a lot. This is like a playoff series. We've played them three times in 12 days. We learned a lot on the tactical side,\" Wembanyama said. \"I don't want to say too much about it. Keep something for us.\"\n\nRegardless of whatever basketball secrets Wembanyama is pocketing, the Spurs' roster is perfectly built to counter OKC's league-best defense. They have several ball-handlers who can slash through their defenders and get to the rim with ease. They have the perfect mix of speed, size and athleticism.\n\nOne possession, Castle is out-muscling Williams on his way to an and-one layup. Next possession, Wembanyama is forcing Shai Gilgeous-Alexander to second-guess himself on his drives to the basket.\n\nWe'll see what a potential NBA playoff series could look like. If you've followed the NBA long enough, you should know that what happens in December and in April/May are two completely different beasts. The Thunder have the track record to back up their basketball style results in rings. The Spurs aren't there yet.\n\nUntil then, though, the Thunder have seen their first real challenger step up that could prevent them from going back-to-back. Don't expect Wembanyama and the Spurs to go anywhere for the foreseeable future, either.\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Victor Wembanyama won't reveal secrets to how Spurs beat Thunder",

Landman, who leads the team with 123 tackles and has forced four fumbles, has been a revelation for the Rams adding range and instincts at a position they have tended not to value. Landman, who played for Atlanta in 2022-24, will be important in trying to corral Falcons RB Bijan Robinson as both a runner and receiver.\n\nRobinson leads the NFL with 131.5 scrimmage yards per game. He needs 151 scrimmage yards to break William Andrews’ team record of 2,176 set in 1983. Robinson has at least 100 combined rushing and receiving yards in 10 games this season.\n\nRams WR Puka Nacua will be a difficult matchup against a short-handed Falcons secondary. Atlanta CB Mike Hughes is expected to miss his second consecutive game with an ankle sprain, leaving undrafted rookie Cobee Bryant and backup C.J. Henderson to work with starter A.J. Terrell. Henderson was signed from the practice squad last week and had a game-saving interception at Arizona. Nacua leads the NFL with 114 catches for 1,592 yards and eight touchdowns.\n\nRams:: WR Davante Adams (hamstring) and RG Kevin Dotson (ankle) could be held out as the Rams will prioritize making sure both key players are ready for the playoffs. … S Quentin Lake (elbow) will return to practice next week and could be available for the regular-season finale against the Cardinals. … CB Roger McCreary is expected to play this week after sustaining a groin injury in his Rams’ debut Nov. 23 that led to a stint on injured reserve.\n\nFalcons: Hughes was declared unlikely to return this week by coach Raheem Morris and is expected to miss his second consecutive game. ... WR Drake London (knee) was limited in practice. London returned against Arizona after missing four games. He briefly left the game against the Cardinals after appearing to aggravate the injury but Morris expressed confidence in London's status this week. CB Clark Phillips III (triceps, illness) was designated to return from injured reserve on Wednesday.\n\nThe Rams have won the past two regular-season games against the Falcons, scoring at least 31 points in both games. … The Falcons ended Rams coach Sean McVay’s first season with a 26-13 victory in the NFC wild-card round in January 2018. … Atlanta has won both postseason matchups in this series, which goes back to 1966.\n\nRams QB Matthew Stafford needs two touchdown passes in his last two games to set a single-season career high. He had 41 scoring throws in 2011 with the Detroit Lions and again in 2021 with Los Angeles. … Stafford leads the NFL with 40 TD passes with only five interceptions. ... The Rams have scored 30 points in three straight games for the first time since 2018, when they did it in four straight. … Nacua had a career-high 225 yards receiving in the loss to the Seahawks. It was his third straight game with over 100 yards and sixth of the season. … The previous time the Rams led the league in scoring was in McVay’s first season as head coach in 2017. They have done it six times since the AFL-NFL merger. … TE Colby Parkinson has six touchdown receptions this season and needs one more to set the Rams’ single-season record at the position. … DL Kobie Turner got his first career interception against the Seahawks. Turner needs 2 1/2 sacks in his last two games to set a career high; he had nine sacks as a rookie in 2023. … Morris was the Rams defensive coordinator from 2021-23. ... Atlanta assistant coaches who previously worked on McVay's staff in Los Angeles: offensive coordinator Zac Robinson (2019-23), pass game specialist/game management Tim Berbenich (2023), offensive assistant K.J. Black (2022-23), assistant offensive line coach Nick Jones (2021-23) and director player performance John Griffin (2021-23). ... The Falcons rank second in the league with 50 sacks, five away from their team record of 55 set in 1997. ... Three of the Falcons' six wins came in prime-time games against Minnesota, Buffalo and Tampa Bay. Atlanta lost a prime-time game at San Francisco.\n\nFalcons TE Kyle Pitts has at least six catches in four straight games, including seven for 57 yards and a touchdown last week. His 395 receiving yards in the past four games are the most by a tight end in a four-game span in franchise history. Pitts has set career highs with 80 catches and five touchdown receptions this season and has been especially effective with Kirk Cousins at quarterback.\n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/NFL",

    "fullText": "The Classic at Damien has another loaded field and the Platinum Division bracket headlines the end-of-year festivities in La Verne, Calif.\n\nThere’s never any shortage of exciting finishes at the event. Crean Lutheran (Calif.) pulled off an impressive 62-59 victory against Owyhee (Idaho), putting together a huge second half to erase what was once a 17-point deficit.\n\nOwyhee notched 18 points in each of the first two quarters on Friday to build a 36-26 lead at halftime. The Storm came out hot, going 8-14 from the floor in the first quarter. Senior point guard Logan Haustveit has been the primary weapon and he finished with a team-high 18 points on 6-16 shooting.\n\nThe Saints recovered well from the slow start and hung with Owhyee heading into the break. They then flipped the script in the third quarter.\n\nJust six Crean Lutheran players scored on Friday, and it was Hunter Caplan that led the charge. He dropped 20 points on 5-13 shooting, knocking down a trio of 3-pointers. Senior center Chadrack Mpoyi was right behind with 15 points of his own. The Minnesota commit led the team with seven field goals and he also added four rebounds.\n\nDown by just a point heading into the fourth, the Saints kept chugging and led by as many as five with just over four minutes to go in regulation. Owhyee had a couple of last gasps, but Lutheran didn’t relinquish the momentum and hung on for the win to continue on in the winner’s bracket.\n\nSaints senior guard Nick Giarrusso played nearly 30 minutes and poured in 13 points to go with a game-high seven rebounds and five assists. He finished +13, the best of anyone on the court. Lutheran shot nearly 49 percent from the floor in the comeback win.\n\nBehind Haustveit, Owyhee also got 12 points from senior Canaan Magness. The Storm got 18 points from its bench, while Crean Lutheran had just two. Owyhee led for over 17 minutes of game time, but will now look to get back on track in the consolation bracket. It will face the loser of Friday night’s game between Centennial (Calif.) and Sandra Day O’Connor (Ariz.) on Saturday.\n\nCrean Lutheran will take on the winner. The Saints are the No. 18 team in California, according to the Massey Ratings. Owyhee remains the No. 1 team in Idaho.\n\nFor high school boys basketball fans looking to keep up with scores around the nation, staying updated on the action is now easier than ever with the Rivals High School Scoreboard.

    "description": "The new Spartans and Wolverines head coaches have battled before, with one of them leading their team to a massive second half comeback",
    "fullText": "A new coaching rivalry in the state of Michigan has been born. But next year's battle for the Paul Bunyan trophy won't be the first time these new Michigan and Michigan State head coaches have met on the field.\n\nAs we all know by now, Michigan State football will have a new head coach next season with Pat Fitzgerald taking over the Spartans. And now, we know who will be leading the rival Wolverines next year: former Utah coach Kyle Whittingham. News broke on Friday that Whittingham would be named the next Michigan head coach, with the longtime Utes head man expected to sign a five-year deal with Michigan.\n\nSo, like we saw just two years ago with Jonathan Smith and Sherrone Moore, next fall's matchup between the Spartans and Wolverines will feature two new head coaches to the rivalry. But this will actually be the second time that Fitzgerald and Whittingham squared off in a game, which Fitzgerald came out with the victory.\n\nFitzgerald led Northwestern to a Holiday Bowl comeback victory over Whittingham's Utes in 2018. The Wildcats were able to overcome a 17-point halftime deficit to stun Utah and earn the Holiday Bowl victory. That was the lone meeting between these two longtime head coaches, but obviously will not be the last moving forward.\n\nFitzgerald's halftime speech that helped spark the comeback in the 2018 Holiday Bowl circulated on social media on Friday shortly after the news of Whittingham heading to Michigan. You can check out that video in the social media post below:\n\nInside the halftime speech from Pat Fitzgerald in the 2018 Holiday Bowl win for Northwestern.\n\n“One stop, one score, one stop, one score, now here we go.”\n\nNU defeated Utah 31-20 and forced five second half turnovers after trailing 20-3 at halftime of the game.\n\nVia @NU_Sports pic.twitter.com/95ceeIhcdP\n\n— Kenny Jordan (@Kenny_Jordan5) December 26, 2025\n\nUltimately, Fitzgerald's record against Whittingham from their previous stops means nothing in the future of the Michigan-Michigan State rivalry. Just like how Fitzgerald's abysmal record against the Wolverines while coaching Northwestern is also meaningless. But, nonetheless, it's still a fun little nugget to keep in mind as we dive into the next chapter of the Spartans-Wolverines rivalry.\n\nThe date for next year's Michigan-Michigan State game has not yet been announced but it should once again be a high-energy and fun matchup. Hopefully, Michigan State can come out on top and pick up their first victory over the Wolverines since Kenneth Walker III stole the show in 2021.\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "Why Michigan hired Kyle Whittingham over Kalen DeBoer, other options after Sherrone Moore firing originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nMichigan was put in a tough spot when revelations of an improper relationship forced the exit of coach Sherrone Moore after the coaching carousel had largely come to a stop.\n\nWhile the Wolverines made it clear they planned to conduct a full search to try to reset the program, doing so in mid-to-late December comes with fewer replacement options and a very small window to make a hire.\n\nMichigan's search reached a conclusion on Friday, and the result was a coach many believed was retired. The Wolverines agreed to hire former Utah coach Kyle Whittingham, who stepped down after 21 seasons at the helm of the Utes on Dec. 12.\n\nHere's what you need to know about Michigan's decision to hire Whittingham after Moore's unexpected firing.\n\nMORE:Sherrone Moore charges, explained\n\nIn many ways, Whittingham can be viewed as a stopgap option. He is in his late 60s and at least weighed retirement in recent years. That could be exactly what Michigan was looking for, despite its prestige and championship expectations.\n\nInterim coach Biff Poggi told reporters after Moore's firing and arrest that the program has been a \"malfunctioning organization\" for five years and required a \"massive self-examination.\" Whittingham may be year-to-year at Michigan at his age, but after running a mostly clean program at Utah for more than two decades and winning plenty of games while doing so, he might be the ideal candidate to reset the Wolverines.\n\nWhittingham said he had anticipated retiring after the 2024 season but wanted to return for at least one more run because of a disappointing finish. As expected, Whittingham stepped down after going 10-2 this past season, but he didn't label the decision a retirement, telling reporters recently that he was \"in the transfer portal.\"\n\nWhether Whittingham envisioned becoming the next head coach at Michigan or not, the Wolverines are giving him the chance to steady the ship and finish his coaching career at a premier program after more than two decades of winning at Utah.\n\nHere's a look at some of the other candidates Michigan considered:\n\nReports tied Michigan to Louisville coach Jeff Brohm in recent days, and Brohm unintentionally fed into the rumors when he told reporters, \"I don't speak on other jobs,\" after the Cardinals' Boca Raton Bowl win over Toledo.\n\nBrohm, who had success at Purdue before returning to his alma mater three years ago, was \"directly contacted\" by Michigan, 247 Sports reported.\n\nMORE: Who are the highest-paid coaches in college football?\n\nAlabama coach Kaleb DeBoer was one of the earliest targets of Michigan's search as some wondered whether Ann Arbor might be a better fit for Nick Saban's successor, but the Crimson Tide's playoff win over Oklahoma delayed the timeline of a potential exit, and DeBoer himself quelled rumors by telling reports he had \"no plans of talking with anyone\" at Michigan.\n\nArizona State coach Kenny Dillingham was reported as a potential candidate for Michigan, but he agreed to a new contract extension with the Sun Devils after the Wolverines job opened up and told reporters he never received a formal offer from Michigan.\n\nMORE:Michigan's timeline of trouble since Jim Harbaugh hiring\n\nWhittingham agreed to a five-year contract, ESPN's Pete Thamel reported, with the deal worth $8.2 million annually.\n\nWhittingham is set to make $8 million in 2026, and the contract is 75 percent guaranteed.\n\nWhile Whittingham may be viewed as a stopgap option after the Moore scandal, the five-year deal indicates Michigan at least plans to move forward with the veteran coach for more than one or two seasons.\n\nWhittingham turned 66 in November, making him one of the oldest FBS head coaches.\n\nA BYU graduate who got his coaching start as a graduate assistant with the Cougars, Whittingham spent a whopping 32 seasons at Utah. He started his Utes tenure as defensive line coach in 1994 before taking over as defensive coordinator in 1995. Urban Meyer retained Whittingham when he took over the program in 2003, and Whittingham took the reins after Meyer's departure for Florida at the end of the 2004 season.\n\nWhittingham said he strongly considered retiring after the 2024 season but \"couldn't step away on that note,\" referencing a disappointing 5-7 season. After a 10-win campaign in 2025, Whittingham stepped away as many expected.\n\n\"The time is right to step down from my position as the head football coach at the University of Utah,\" he said in a statement, offering few details.\n\nWhile many initially believed Whittingham was retiring, reports indicated he planned to keep his options open, and the veteran coach himself later said he was \"in the transfer portal.\"\n\nWhittingham may have simply viewed this juncture as the right time for a change after 32 years at Utah and 21 as the head coach. His defensive coordinator, Morgan Scalley, had already been labeled Utah's coach-in-waiting, so a succession plan was in place. Whittingham's decision to exit came two days after Moore's firing at Michigan, so the Wolverines' opening could have been in the back of his mind.\n\nMORE:Revisiting Michigan's sign-stealing scandal\n\nHere's a season-by-season breakdown of Whittingham's tenure at Utah:\n\nWhittingham had only three losing seasons at Utah, winning at least 10 games in eight different seasons.\n\nWhittingham guided the Utes to an undefeated season in the Mountain West in 2008 and won back-to-back conference titles in the Pac-12 between 2021 and 2022. \n\nMORE: Tracking every move of the 2025-26 colleeg football coaching carousel\n\nWhittingham ranks as the fourth-oldest head coach in the FBS:\n\nMichigan wasn't expected to make a head coaching change after going 9-3 in 2025, but Moore was fired on Dec. 10 after the university received evidence of a longstanding relationship between the coach and a staffer.\n\nReports have since alleged that the relationship began before Moore succeeded Jim Harbaugh as head coach in 2024 and that the relationship was rumored within the facility. Moore is married with three children.\n\nHours after being fired, Moore was arrested for allegedly breaking into the home of the woman with whom he was involved in the improper relationship and threatening to take his own life. Moore was hit with three charges on Dec. 12, including felony home invasion.\n\nMore reports in the wake of Moore's firing have detailed the erosion of relationships within Michigan's program, with The Athletic alleging Moore became \"increasingly volatile\" in the months leading up to his firing to the point that \"fellow staff members became concerned about his mental state.\n\nMORE:Explaining the Sherrone Moore scandal",

    "fullText": "The Pittsburgh Pirates are reportedly one of the few teams interested in infielder Yoan Moncada in free agency.\n\nPittsburgh vowed to be aggressive this offseason to build a contending team around Paul Skenes and its deep pitching staff. MLB insider Francys Romero reported that the Pirates are one of four teams showing interest in Moncada.\n\n“Several teams, including the Angels, Pirates, White Sox, and Blue Jays, have shown early interest in free-agent third baseman Yoan Moncada, per sources,” Romero wrote on X on Friday. “Despite thumb and knee issues, Moncada had a solid 2025 and could contribute even more next season among third basemen.”\n\nMoncada spent last season with the Los Angeles Angels after spending one year with the Boston Red Sox and eight years with the Chicago White Sox. The Red Sox signed Moncada in 2015, as he was one of the top free agents available, but the infielder has struggled to live up to the hype.\n\nMoncada’s best season came in 2019 with the White Sox when he hit .315 with 25 home runs and 79 RBIs. But injuries have derailed his career as he hasn’t played over 100 games since 2022, when he played just 104. With the Angels last season, Moncada hit .234 with 12 home runs and 35 RBIs.\n\nIf the Pirates sign Moncada, he would join an infield that features Jared Triolo at third base, Nick Gonzalez at shortstop, newly-acquired Brandon Lowe at shortstop, and Spencer Horwitz at first base.\n\nMore Pirates: Aggressive Pirates Having Sensational Offseason Thus Far\n\nThe post Pirates Reportedly One Of Four Teams Interested In Intriguing Free Agent Infielder appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "description": "Solid-state batteries are poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represent a transformational leap in energy storage.",
    "fullText": "Solid-state batteries charge in a fraction of the time, run cooler, and pack more energy into less space than traditional lithium-ion versions.\n\nA new review from the University of California, Riverside, published in Nano Energy, explains why this technology is poised to transform everything from electric cars to consumer electronics, and represents a major leap in energy storage.\n\nThese batteries replace the flammable liquid found in standard versions with a solid material that is safer and far more efficient. Where today’s batteries may take 30 to 45 minutes to reach 80% charge, solid-state models can cut that time to 12 minutes, and in some cases, as little as three.\n\nLead author Cengiz Ozkan, a professor of mechanical engineering at UCR, said the benefits come down to chemistry and engineering. “By removing the liquid and using stable solid materials instead, we can safely push more electricity into the battery at once, without the risks of overheating or fires,” he said.\n\nConventional lithium-ion batteries move lithium ions, the particles that carry electric charge, through a liquid. But that liquid can degrade over time, limit charging speed, and pose fire risks. Solid-state batteries use a solid material instead, which offers a safer and more stable environment for lithium ions to move through. This enables faster, more efficient charging with fewer safety concerns.\n\nThe solid inside these batteries is known as a solid-state electrolyte. The review highlights three main types: sulfide-based, oxide-based, and polymer-based. Each type has strengths: some allow ions to move faster, others offer better long-term stability or are easier to manufacture. One standout group, sulfide-based electrolytes, performs almost as well as the liquid in current batteries, but without the downsides.\n\nThe researchers also describe the tools scientists now use to watch batteries work in real time. Techniques like neutron imaging and high-powered X-rays let researchers see how lithium moves inside a battery as it charges and discharges. This helps identify areas where the lithium gets stuck or where unwanted structures called “dendrites” start to grow. Dendrites are tiny, needle-like formations that can cause a battery to short-circuit or fail.\n\nUnderstanding these inner workings is key to making better batteries. “These imaging tools are like an MRI for batteries,” Ozkan said. “They let us watch the battery’s vital signs and make smarter design choices.”\n\nSolid-state batteries also tend to use lithium more efficiently. Many designs feature a lithium metal layer that can store more energy in less space than the graphite layers used in current batteries. This means solid-state batteries can be lighter and smaller while still powering devices for just as long, or longer.\n\nWhile conventional lithium-ion batteries typically begin to show noticeable degradation after approximately 5–8 years of use in electric vehicles, solid-state batteries could remain functional for 15–20 years or more, depending on usage and environmental factors.\n\n“Traditional lithium-ion batteries, while revolutionary, are reaching their performance and safety limits as electric vehicles, renewable energy grids, portable electronics, and aerospace systems become more widespread and demanding,” Ozkan said.\n\nOzkan said solid-state batteries could also play a pivotal role in the future of interstellar travel and space exploration.\n\nDue to their thermal and chemical stability, these batteries are better suited to withstand extreme temperatures and radiation conditions in outer space. They’re also able to store more power in less space, which is critical for missions where every cubic centimeter counts. And without liquid electrolytes, they would be more reliable in closed, oxygen-controlled environments like spacecraft or planetary bases.\n\nThe researchers’ goal with this review was to guide researchers and technologists in accelerating the development, scalability, and real-world deployment of solid-state systems.\n\nBut challenges remain. Making these batteries on a large scale is still difficult and expensive. The paper offers a roadmap for solving these problems, including developing better materials, refining how the battery parts interact, and improving factory techniques to make production easier.\n\n“Solid-state batteries are moving closer to reality every day,” Ozkan said. “Our review shows how far the science has come and what steps are needed next to make these batteries available for everyday use.”\n\n(Cover image of solid-state batteries: Just_Super/Getty)",

    "title": "Reality crushed Ÿnsect startup that had raised over $600M for insect farming",
    "description": "French insect farming company Ÿnsect was recently placed into judicial liquidation for insolvency, despite raising over $600 million.",
    "fullText": "French startup Ÿnsect shot into the spotlight when “Iron Man” star Robert Downey Jr. touted its merits on the Late Show during Super Bowl weekend 2021. Now, nearly four years later, the insect farming company has been placed into judicial liquidation — essentially bankruptcy — for insolvency.\n\nThe company’s demise is hardly a surprise, as Ÿnsect had been embattled for months. Still, there is plenty to unpack about how a startup can go bankrupt despite raising over $600 million, including from Downey Jr’s FootPrint Coalition, taxpayers, and many others.\n\nUltimately, Ÿnsect failed to fulfill its ambition to “revolutionize the food chain” with insect-based protein. But don’t be too quick to attribute its failure to the ‘ick’ factor that many Westerners feel about bugs. Human food was never its core focus.\n\nInstead, Ÿnsect focused on producing insect protein for animal feed and pet food, two markets with very different economics and margins that the company never quite chose between.\n\nThat indecision extended to its M&A strategy. In 2021, Ÿnsect acquired Protifarm, a Dutch company raising mealworms for human food applications, adding a third market to the mix. Even as the company announced the deal, then-CEO Antoine Hubert admitted it would take a couple of years for human food to represent just 10% to 15% of Ÿnsect’s revenue.\n\n“We still see pet food and fish feed being the largest contributor to our revenues in the coming years,” Hubert declared at the time. In other words, Ÿnsect was acquiring a company in a market segment that would remain marginal for years — at a time when the startup desperately needed revenue growth.\n\nAnd revenue was the problem. According to publicly available data, Ÿnsect’s revenue from its main entity peaked at €17.8 million in 2021 (approximately $21 million) — a figure reportedly inflated by internal transfers between subsidiaries. By 2023, the company had racked up a net loss of €79.7 million ($94 million).\n\nSo how did a company with such meager revenue raise over $600 million? The answer wasn’t hype-driven crossover funds paying ambitious multiples during the 2021 funding frenzy. Instead, Ÿnsect attracted impact-focused investors like Astanor Ventures and public investment bank Bpifrance that bought into a compelling sustainability vision.\n\nIts pitch to them was simple — offering an alternative to resource-intensive proteins like fishmeal and soy. That same thesis also attracted significant capital to competitors like Better Origin and Innovafeed, and it seemed promising.\n\nBut the vision collided with market reality. Animal feed is a commodity market driven by price, not sustainability premiums. In a perfect world, insect protein would be fully circular, with insects fed on food waste that would otherwise go to landfill. But in practice, factory-scale insect production typically ends up relying on cereal byproducts that are already usable as animal feed — meaning insect protein just adds an expensive extra step. For animal feed, the math simply wasn’t working.\n\nŸnsect eventually recognized this. Pet food proved to be a different equation: it is less price-driven than animal feed and a far better market for insect protein, even with competition from other alternative proteins such as lab-grown meat. By 2023, the company refocused its strategy on pet food and other higher-margin segments, with Hubert citing broader economic pressures.\n\n“In an environment where there is inflation on energy and raw materials but also on the cost of capital and debt, we cannot afford to invest loads of resources in markets which are the least remunerative (animal feed), while you have other markets where there is a lot of demand, good returns and higher margins,” Hubert said at the time.\n\nThe 2023 pivot to pet food came too late. By then, Ÿnsect had already committed to a massive, capital-intensive bet that would ultimately doom the company. That bet was Ÿnfarm, a “giga-factory” in Northern France that the company billed “the world’s most expensive bug farm.” Built for insect production at scale, the facility consumed hundreds of millions in funding — money spent before Ÿnsect had proven its business model or figured out its unit economics.\n\nTo oversee Ÿnfarm’s launch, Ÿnsect brought in Shankar Krishnamoorthy, a former executive at French energy giant Engie. When that move to pet food failed to save the company, Krishnamoorthy replaced Hubert as CEO.\n\nŸnsect then shut down the production plant it had acquired from Protifarm and cut jobs. But shuttering one facility while operating a giga-factory built for the wrong market couldn’t solve the fundamental problem.\n\nFor Professor Joe Haslam, who teaches a course on Scaling Up in the MBA Program at IE Business School, “Ÿnsect’s struggles are not a mystery and not mainly about insects. They are the result of a mismatch between industrial ambition, capital markets, and timing, compounded by some execution and strategy choices.”\n\nThe fact that Ÿnsect failed doesn’t mean the entire insect farming sector is doomed. Competitor Innovafeed is reportedly holding up better, in part because it started with a smaller production site and is ramping up incrementally.\n\nFor Prof. Haslam, Ÿnsect exemplifies a broader European problem. “Ÿnsect is a case study in Europe’s scaling gap. We fund moonshots. We underfund factories. We celebrate pilots. We abandon industrialization. See Northvolt [a struggling Swedish battery maker], Volocopter [a German air taxi startup, and Lilium [a failed Germany flying taxi company],” he said.\n\nThe failure has prompted some soul-searching. Hubert himself co-founded Start Industrie, an association advocating for policies to support French industrial startups — a recognition that Europe needs more than just funding to build the next generation of deep-tech companies.",

    "fullText": "Did you know vodka in Russian means “little water”?\n\nThe origins of the modern words for “water” in the western world are ancient. There are two main roots for the names we have water: ap and wed. Ap was used when speaking of water as a “living force” in action, and wed when speaking of water as an inanimate object.\n\nBoth roots originate several thousand years ago in something called Proto-Indo European (PIE), believed to be spoken in what’s now Eastern Europe and Western Asia. PIE is the ancestor of most widely-spoken languages in the past several millennia like Sanskrit, Greek, Latin, Persian, English, Spanish–really, most languages you know of today that are not of East Asian, Semitic, and African origin.\n\nThose two roots–ap and wed--form the two key root variations of the words you probably know for “water”. Proto-Indo European speakers supposedly called it akwa or wodor, depending on the context. In Sanskrit, water was apah. 3000 years ago, the Hittites called it watar. A thousand years later, speakers of proto-Germanic (the ancestor of English, Germanic, and Scandinavian languages) would say akwo or watar. Around the same time, Latin speakers decided to stick with aqua, and English speakers seemed to settle on variations of water, dropping akwo. Old English speakers said wæter.\n\nThat’s right: The Spanish word “aqua” and the English word “water” have changed little in several thousand years. The Greeks originally called it hudor, the source of the prefixes “hydro” and “hydra” (hudra); the Cherokee say ama. An ancient Sanskrit speaker would understand the modern Romanian word for water: apa.\n\nAnd Russian speaker call it voda. So, voda+ka = vodka, or “little water”, making a vodka tonic a “little water with water”. Now you know.",

Who doesn’t want to increase the odds of something unexpected and good?\n\nIn our world, luck can include:\n\nHaving your OSS library take off\n\nBeing invited to speak at a conference\n\nGetting a new consulting client\n\nMaking new friends in your community\n\nNone of these things are totally in your control, which can at times feel frustrating.\n\nHow can we increase the odds of finding luck? By being a person who works in public. By doing work and being public about it, you build a reputation for yourself. You build a track record. You build a public body of work that speaks on your behalf better than any resume ever could.\n\nThe goal is not to become famous, the goal is to increase the chances of luck finding us. For me, one of the most helpful ways to think about this has always been the concept of the “Luck Surface Area,” described in an old post by Jason Roberts. He wrote (and note, the emphasis is mine):\n\n\"The amount of serendipity that will occur in your life, your Luck Surface Area, is directly proportional to the degree to which you do something you’re passionate about combined with the total number of people to whom this is effectively communicated.\"\n\nGoing further, he codifies it into a formula where:\n\nThe more things you do multiplied by the more people you tell, the larger your Luck Surface Area becomes. The larger your Luck Surface Area, the more likely you are to catch luck as it flows by.\n\nBefore you can publish your work, you have to actually do the work. The good news for you is that by even reading this Guide on The ReadME Project, you’ve probably already self-selected into a group of people for whom “doing things” comes somewhat naturally. You’re a developer, a designer, a creator, an author, or something else entirely.  Whatever moniker you want to give yourself, you’re built to do things, and that’s the important part.\n\nIf that doesn’t ring true for you, you may fall into one of two groups:\n\nYou actually are doing things, you’ve just trained yourself to think that anything you do isn’t worth sharing.\n\nYou want to be doing things, but you can’t bring yourself to get started.\n\nIf you’re in the first group, you may need to step back and reframe the work you’re already doing. This is a common blind spot for people who are executing at a high level! They’ve forgotten just how much they know. They think that they’re not doing anything interesting because they assume that everyone knows as much as they do. This effect is only exacerbated when everyone in your immediate vicinity is at a similar—or higher—skill level. As you become more of an expert, your quality bar gets higher and higher and you forget that everything you know is not known by everyone.\n\nIf you’re in this group I want to give you a challenge: Watch the communities where you hang out and see what people are sharing and what gets noticed. Is it something you could have done? Is it something you’ve already done? At its worst this could lead you in the direction of becoming bitter, critical, and thinking that you’re smarter than everyone. To that I say “resist!” There is no life there. My encouragement to you is to view that as objective evidence that people want to know all of the things that you already know! There is a huge opportunity for you, should you decide to start sharing your work.\n\nIf you’re in the second group, you just need to start. Start anywhere, start on anything, start something. You’ll never come up with the perfect idea for an OSS library, a business, a podcast, or an article by just thinking about it. Start on something, today. It won’t be the perfect version of the thing you have in your head, but you’ll be in motion. Motion begets motion, progress begets progress. Pick the smallest thing you can do and get started.\n\nDoing the work is the most important part. It’s the nucleus around which everything else revolves. What that “work” looks like, though, is entirely up to you! That’s the fun part. It can take any form and be in any domain. Wherever your curiosity or expertise draw you, dive into that.\n\nProjects outside of work are a good place to dive into your curiosity.\n\nIf you want to make a thermal receipt printer that prints GitHub issues, you should.\n\nIf you want to turn a prefabricated shed into an office, go for it.\n\nIf you want to go all in on an SVG drawing tool, do it.\n\nIf you want to write tens of thousands of words about the infrastructure of modern money, that’s a newsletter.\n\nYour curiosity will naturally pull you in certain directions, so don’t be afraid to go super deep into a topic that you’re interested in. When a person is truly interested in the thing they’re writing or talking about, their excitement is contagious. Whatever you’re excited about, be excited about it publicly. Whatever you’re curious about, be curious about it publicly. People will want to follow along and you’ll inspire people along the way.\n\nProjects at work can be a good place to dive into your expertise.\n\nIt's likely you're constantly solving problems and learning interesting things at your job. This is a great opportunity to take what you’re already doing and repurpose it for the benefit of others. You can turn those learnings into blog posts, conference talks, meetups, podcasts, or open source projects.\n\nOf course not everything you do at work is shareable. If the specifics aren’t shareable, the concepts, lessons, and takeaways likely are. While you’re working, keep a scratch pad open and jot down any problems you come across, interesting patterns you see, or things you found confusing. Do this for a month and you’ll have more things to share than you know what to do with!\n\nYou’ve done the work, now it's time to tell people.\n\nThis part of the formula can be harder for most of us. Most of us really enjoy the building aspect but start to get a little shy when it comes to telling people about the stuff we’ve built. That could be for any number of reasons: fear, embarrassment, self-preservation, or an aversion to being perceived as hawking your wares.\n\nIt’s a valuable exercise to investigate whether or not you resonate with any of those reasons. Are you afraid people are going to make fun of what you built? Are you embarrassed that it isn’t up to your own (admittedly high) standards? Are you waiting for some elusive perfect moment? Do you have an aversion to “marketing” and don’t want to become the thing you hate? Whatever it is for you, I encourage you to really dig into it and see if that fear is worth keeping around.\n\nSharing things you’re learning or making is not prideful. People are drawn to other people in motion. People want to follow along, people want to learn things, people want to be a part of your journey. It’s not bragging to say, “I’ve made a thing and I think it’s cool!” Bringing people along is a good thing for everyone. By publishing your work you’re helping people learn. You’re inspiring others to create.\n\nYou can “publish” anywhere. For me that’s mostly Twitter because that’s where most of my peers hang out. It doesn’t have to be Twitter for you. It could be GitHub, a newsletter, a podcast, forums, your blog, YouTube, or something completely different that’s not even on my radar. Anywhere that’s not your hard drive counts!\n\nPublishing is a skill, it’s something you can learn. You’ll need to build your publishing skill just like you built every other skill you have.\n\nDon’t be afraid to publish along the way. You don’t have to wait until you’re done to drop a perfect, finished artifact from the sky (in fact, you may use that as an excuse to never publish). People like stories, so use that to your benefit. Share the wins, the losses, and the thought processes. Bring us along! If you haven’t been in the habit of sharing your work, it’s going to feel weird when you start. That’s normal! Keep going, you get used to it.\n\nYou’ve done the work. You’ve hit the publish button. You’ve done your part!\n\nYou’ve increased the odds that good, unexpected things will come your way. The exact form is hard to predict, but here are a few potential outcomes:\n\nPeople start to know you as the person that talks about X, Y, and Z.\n\nYou start to get emails from people saying that they read your stuff and liked it.\n\nYou get a DM about a job you might be interested in.\n\nPeople ask you if you’re taking on new clients.\n\nSomeone you’ve never met or interacted with will mention you as being an expert in your area.\n\nA meetup asks you to come talk about the things you’ve been sharing.\n\nYou become friends with other people in your industry.\n\nYour OSS library starts gaining mindshare.\n\nThis is not a random list of made-up examples, it’s a list of things that have literally happened to me once I got over my fears and started sharing my work. I had been doing the work all along, but was too afraid to publish. Once I overcame that fear, my Luck Surface Area expanded and good, unexpected things started happening.\n\nDo the work. Don’t be afraid to dive deep into your curiosity and your expertise. We need more people that are intensely curious. We need more people with deep expertise.\n\nTell people. Press publish, bring us along, share the journey. Tell us what you’ve learned, what you’ve built, or what you’re excited about.\n\nThe formula may be simple, but I’ll admit it’s not always easy. It’s scary to put yourself out there. It’s hard to open yourself up to criticism. People online can be mean. But for every snarky comment, there are ten times as many people quietly following along and admiring not only your work, but your bravery to put it out publicly. And at some point, one of those people quietly following along will reach out with a life-changing opportunity and you’ll think, “Wow, that was lucky.”\n\nHello, my name is Aaron.

He works in IT and earns about $90,000 a year, while she earns roughly $55,000. He wrote that growing up lower middle class shaped his careful approach to money.\n\nUntil recently, he wrote, their everyday spending had felt manageable.

He created a rough budget covering flights, hotels, trains, food, and tours, estimating the total at about $4,500 for both of them — excluding shopping.\n\nHe suggested that if they started saving immediately, each could set aside about $400 to $450 per month over several months and split the cost evenly.\n\nAfter reviewing the spreadsheet, she laughed and questioned why he was treating the trip \"like a business contract,\" pointing out that he earns significantly more. She added that a serious partner would simply cover the trip and let her contribute in smaller ways.\n\nIn response, he wrote that he did not want to set a pattern where major expenses automatically fell on him, especially before they lived together.\n\nSee Also: This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, with minimum investments as low as $100.\n\nThe OP explained his financial priorities, including paying down student loans and building an emergency fund.

During that discussion, she compared him to an ex who never asked her to pay for vacations.\n\nSince then, he said, the tension continued. She made sarcastic comments about money during meals, and later compromise proposals were dismissed.\n\nHe suggested splitting costs based on income, such as a 60-40 arrangement or covering flights while she handled her spending money.

    "title": "Human evolution’s biggest mystery has started to unravel. How 2025 tipped the scales",
    "description": "Scientists working to solve human evolution’s biggest mystery made a big breakthrough in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Human evolution’s biggest mystery, which emerged 15 years ago from a 60,000-year-old pinkie finger bone, finally started to unravel in 2025.\n\nAnalysis of DNA extracted from the fossil electrified the scientific community in 2010, when it revealed a previously unknown human population that had, in the distant past, encountered and interbred with our own species, Homo sapiens. This enigmatic group became known as the Denisovans after Denisova Cave in Siberia’s Altai Mountains, where the pinkie finger was found.\n\nDespite intimate knowledge of this population’s genetic makeup, traces of which millions of people carry today, scientists knew nothing about the appearance of the Denisovans, or where they lived or why they disappeared. The discovery, and the questions it unleashed, galvanized a generation of geneticists, archaeologists and paleoanthropologists.\n\nSome of that work paid off this year, and scientists at last put a face to the Denisovan name by extracting new clues from another well-known fossil: a prehistoric human skull that didn’t seem to fit with any known group. Now, other jigsaw pieces have begun to fall into place.\n\nWhen the skull came to light in Harbin in northeastern China in 2018 after being stashed for safekeeping at the bottom of a well for decades, some scientists had a hunch that it might be Denisovan.\n\nDNA sequences from the group had been detected in the genomes of present-day Asians, but not Europeans, suggesting that this region was where the Denisovans predominantly lived.\n\nBased on its distinctive shape, the researchers attributed the skull to a newfound species they called Homo longi or “Dragon Man.” The dozen or so Denisovan fossils that had been identified since 2010 using DNA were too small and fragmentary to warrant an official species name.\n\nGetting ancient DNA from the skull, which was estimated to be 146,000 years old, was the key to understanding whether there was a link between Dragon Man and the Denisovans. However, it proved to be tricky.\n\nA team led by Qiaomei Fu, a geneticist and professor at the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology, part of the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, tested six bone samples from Dragon Man’s lone surviving tooth and the cranium’s petrous bone, a dense piece at the base of the skull that’s often a rich source of DNA in fossils. However, the samples yielded no results.\n\nBut Fu, who as a young researcher had been part of the team at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany, that first discovered the Denisovans, reported in June that her team had been able to retrieve Denisovan genetic material from an unexpected \n\nThat information wasn’t a slam-dunk result. The genetic material researchers had retrieved was mitochondrial DNA, which, unlike nuclear DNA, is only inherited through the maternal line, providing an incomplete picture of an individual’s genomic ancestry. This finding meant, potentially, that Dragon Man could have been a mix of two species, something that’s not unprecedented. In 2018, scientists revealed a fossilized bone from Denisova Cave that belonged to a girl with a Neanderthal mother and a Denisovan dad.\n\nHowever, the team also recovered protein fragments from the petrous bone samples, which — though less detailed than DNA — suggested the Dragon Man skull belonged to a Denisovan population.\n\nTogether, the two lines of evidence “cleared up some of the mystery surrounding this population,” Fu told CNN in June when the research was published. “After 15 years, we know the first Denisovan skull.”\n\nThe DNA finding makes it likely that Homo longi will become the official designation for the dozen or so other Denisovan fossils, Chris Stringer, a paleoanthropologist and research leader in human evolution at London’s Natural History Museum, said in an email.\n\nRyan McRae and Briana Pobiner, paleoanthropologists at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, agreed, although they said the name Denisovan would likely persist as a popular name, much like how most people call Homo neanderthalensis Neanderthals today.\n\n“While more work needs to be done to build the body of evidence and give scientists a more complete view of Denisovan anatomy, habitat, and behavior, being able to link complete fossils with the molecular evidence is a huge step forward,” McRae and Pobiner wrote in an annual list of the top stories in human evolution.\n\nAdditional evidence could be in hand, waiting to be identified, researchers suggest, and with it 2026 could be set for more groundbreaking revelations.\n\nA skull fossil, with its telltale bumps and ridges, can reveal a great deal about what an individual looked like, according to John Gurche, a paleoartist who creates reconstructions of ancient human ancestors for museums, including the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History. He recreated Dragon Man’s face for National Geographic.\n\nAssuming the Dragon Man skull belonged to a typical Denisovan individual, scientists said the ancient human would have had pronounced brow ridges, large teeth and lacked our high foreheads. But, if dressed in modern attire, this prehistoric relative may not have drawn too many stares on a subway train.\n\nGurche said that he uses known relationships between soft and bony tissue in humans and apes to recreate facial features, such as the breadth of the eyeball, dimensions of nasal cartilage and the thickness of soft tissue in some parts of the face. More challenging were features about which the skull “offers little information,” including the form of the lips and ears, and placement of the hair.\n\nWith molecular evidence now linking Dragon Man to the Denisovans, it will be easier for paleoanthropologists to identify other potential Denisovan remains, including skull fossils from sites in China that have long defied classification.\n\nMore revelations could come from another skull fossil discovered in China in 2022, which hasn’t been formally described in scientific literature. It’s the third skull to be unearthed at the site known as Yunxian in China’s Hubei province and is thought to date back around 1 million years. The other two craniums were found in 1990.\n\nA digital reconstruction published in September of the second skull, which was badly squashed, from the site suggested it was an early ancestor of Dragon Man, meaning the lineage could have originated much earlier than previously thought.\n\nThe researchers’ wider analysis, based on the reconstruction and more than 100 other skull fossils, also significantly pushes back the timeline for the emergence of species such as our own, Homo sapiens, and Homo neanderthalensis, by 400,000 years.\n\nHowever, the findings attracted some skepticism. More details about the third Yunxian skull would enable the team to test the accuracy of the reconstruction and its placement within the human family tree.\n\nA 200,000-year-old tooth, similar in appearance to the molar still attached to Dragon Man’s skull, may be set to shake up what’s known about the Denisovans and the human family tree more broadly next year and beyond. Researchers found the tooth during an excavation of Denisova Cave in 2020.\n\nStéphane Peyrégne, a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, and his colleagues have since analyzed the molar and from it recovered a Denisovan’s full genome — a highly detailed set of genetic information that can reveal past genetic diversity and evolution.\n\nIt’s only the second time scientists have been able to sequence a “high coverage” genome from a Denisovan fossil — the first was from the finger fossil that revealed the Denisovans’ existence.\n\nThe scientists shared the genome analysis in October on what’s known as a preprint server, which allows study authors to post early versions of their work online, and is undergoing peer review by other researchers. Peyrégne declined to comment on the paper until it’s formally published next year. Stringer described the findings as “very important.”\n\nThe genome allows further investigation of Denisovan biological traits that may influence human health today. For example, a study published in August suggested that a Denisovan gene variant involved in the production of mucous and saliva may have helped Homo sapiens adapt to new environments.\n\nThe new genome is also much older than the first and allows geneticists to probe more deeply into Denisovan history and reconstruct relationships between different ancient populations.\n\nThe genome represents a Denisovan man who lived in a small group 200,000 years ago in Denisova Cave. The group’s analysis revealed that not only had his ancestors apparently interbred with early Neanderthals, but the individual also had ancestry from an unknown “super archaic” group for which there is currently no ancient DNA match.\n\nMcRae at the Smithsonian said traces of these “ghost lineages” have been found in the DNA of modern humans as well, and scientists aren’t sure who they are. They could represent other extinct hominins such as Homo erectus or Homo floresiensis, sometimes known as the “hobbit.”\n\n“Or, it could represent hominins that we genuinely haven’t found in the fossil record. They’re ghosts until we have something to trace them back to,” he said via email.\n\nFiguring out the identity of this group will be a fresh mystery for experts in human evolution to ponder in 2026.\n\n Explore the universe with news on fascinating discoveries, scientific advancements and more.",

Platinum (PL=F) and copper (HG=F) have also soared to records this year.\n\nSome investors have been quick to point out the divergence between the metals industry and cryptocurrency, which has been led by a leg lower in bitcoin (BTC-USD), down roughly 6% year-to-date.

    "description": "In four years, this humble EV saved its owners tens of thousands in fuel costs.",
    "fullText": "The Tesla Model 3 is one of the most popular electric cars in the world.\n\nIt’s particularly popular among big city taxi drivers.\n\nThis rear-wheel drive Model 3 Long Range used to be a taxi, and in just four years, it has racked up no fewer than 238,000 miles.\n\nA recent Consumer Reports study found that used Tesla EVs are at the bottom of the list when it comes to reliability, but there’s some nuance there, and it’s important. CR said that cars made between 2016 and 2021 are the worst offenders, as Tesla was trying to ramp up production any way it could, including using assembly tents.\n\nStarting in 2021, things improved significantly, and it’s clear as day when looking at the blue Model 3 showcased in the RSymons video embedded below. This humble 2021 Tesla Model 3 Long Range had a rough life as a taxi in the United Kingdom, and it racked up an impressive number of miles in just four years: 238,000, to be precise.\n\nAfter so much abuse, any car would have some faults pop up, and this Tesla is no different. But the severity and costs to repair all the issues are undoubtedly much lower than on a comparable gas-powered car.\n\nFirst things first, the ex-taxi Tesla still has its original high-voltage battery, original rear electric motor, original brakes, original bodywork and original windows. That’s mighty impressive, but it gets better still. Except for the steering wheel, which has seen better days and should probably be replaced sooner rather than later, the interior is in great shape after so many miles and passenger rides. The same goes for the bodywork.\n\nGetting back to the big battery, it’s still going strong, with a reported 85.5% state of health, which practically means the car can achieve 85.5% of the range it had on its first day.\n\nThat’s all good news, but the repairs and maintenance costs are where things get interesting. So far, this Tesla Model 3 Long Range has never broken down, and most of the money was spent on normal maintenance items. It’s now on its seventh set of tires, which seems a bit daunting.\n\nStay informed with our newsletter every weekday   back \n\nIt had several bushes replaced, including the rear motor mounts, and the pedestrian warning sound speaker failed at 232,000 miles. In total, the car’s two owners have spent the equivalent of $7,566 (£5,603), including tires, wiper blades, cabin air filters, suspension components and labor.\n\nThat’s not really impressive, but the car makes up for the maintenance costs by saving money on fuel. In total, this Model 3 used 92.6 megawatt-hours of energy, with 28.2 MWh coming from regenerative braking alone. The car used 64,422 kilowatt-hours of payable electricity, and with the average price of $0.17/kWh in the United States, it means that it cost the equivalent of $10,951 to recharge. That’s $2,738 per year or $0.04/mile.\n\nThe fact that the Tesla Model 3 is very efficient helps a lot, with this particular car averaging an impressive 4.2 miles/kWh since February. But there you have it. You might not love Tesla as a brand–or its outspoken CEO–but there’s no denying that the cars it makes are hard to beat.\n\nUsed Tesla EVs Are A Bargain. Reliability Isn't Their Strong Suit\n\n'Absolutely Relentless': What Tesla Had To Learn From Tearing Down Chinese EVs\n\nTesla May Add CarPlay.

    "fullText": "When the flu strikes, it can feel relentless: rising fever, hacking cough, stuffy nose and sore throat. For many people, relief can come in the form of Tamiflu, a prescription antiviral medication used to treat and even prevent the illness.\n\nBut some people may not realize that Tamiflu isn’t the only option.\n\nOther flu treatments are available in the United States. These alternatives sometimes fly under the radar, in part because some are targeted for specific populations. But Xofluza, a one-dose pill, is approved for people 5 years and older – and can be a strong alternative for some people who may otherwise be prescribed Tamiflu.\n\nAntiviral medications tend to work best when started within two days after symptoms begin, so having easy access to treatment options is key for treating the flu most effectively.\n\nTo treat flu this season, there are four antiviral drugs recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: Tamiflu or oseltamivir, Xofluza or baloxavir, Relenza or zanamivir, and Rapivab or peramivir.\n\nTamiflu is used to treat flu in people ages 2 weeks and older, and to reduce the chance of getting the flu in people 1 year and older. The medicine is administered in liquid form or capsules, and typically must be taken twice daily for five days when used for flu treatment. When used for prevention after exposure, it is typically taken once daily for 10 days. Available as a generic or under the trade name Tamiflu, it may cost about $50 or less without insurance. The most common side effects include nausea and vomiting.\n\nAs another option, Xofluza is administered as a single-dose tablet and approved for ages 5 and older. It can be used to treat or prevent the flu, and it may cost nearly $200 without insurance, but eligible patients can use coupons to lessen costs. The most common side effects include diarrhea and vomiting.\n\n“The most common complaint I hear about is vomiting from Tamiflu,” Dr. Ari Brown, a pediatrician based in Texas and author of the Baby 411 book series, said in an email. She referenced a 2023 study that showed about 18% of people experience vomiting with Tamiflu versus 5% with Xofluza.\n\nThe study also found that about 5% of people get diarrhea with Xofluza compared with none taking Tamiflu. “I’ve also had a few pediatric patients experience moodiness with Tamiflu, which is reported in the literature,” she said.\n\nThe “biggest difference” between Tamiflu and Xofluza is that Xofluza can stop viral shedding in one day while Tamiflu may take about three days, Brown said.\n\nThat means the rest of the household may have less exposure to the flu and fewer people may come down with it, but “both antivirals will help reduce the duration of the misery by a couple of days,” Brown said. For instance, with treatment, some people may experience five days of flu symptoms instead of seven.\n\nRapivab is one of the other prescription medications approved to treat flu. The drug is approved for ages 6 months and older, given once as an intravenous infusion by a health care provider. It may cost up to about $1,000 without insurance, and the most common adverse reaction in adults tends to be diarrhea.\n\nLastly, Relenza is the other recommended flu medication. It is inhaled in powder form, and typically administered using an inhaler device twice a day for five days. The prescription drug is approved to treat flu in ages 7 and older, and for preventive use in ages 5 and older. It may cost up to about $90 without insurance. Side effects include allergic reaction, dizziness or irritation of the nose, and it is not recommended for people with breathing problems, such as asthma.\n\nAmong the recommended flu treatments, Tamiflu tends to be the go-to flu medication for most patients. But Xofluza is becoming more widely used, Brown said.\n\nHowever, it may not always be available in pharmacies, recommended by providers or covered by insurance.\n\n“I suspect it is region-dependent,” Brown said about access to treatment.\n\n“When one part of the country has surging flu cases, there is higher demand. We have not encountered this issue in Austin,” she said. For instance, this flu season, she has only had one Xofluza prescription that she needed to send to a different pharmacy because the first pharmacy was out of stock.\n\nBut overall, “Xofluza is rising in popularity over Tamiflu,” Brown said.\n\n“One dose. Fewer side effects. More insurances are covering the cost of it now and manufacturer coupon makes it less expensive than in previous years,” she said, adding that she prefers it for her patients. “But all of the factors above–cost, ability to swallow a pill, availability can impact that decision.”\n\nAnother factor that may impact decisions: There is a growing concern about the influenza virus developing resistance to Xofluza.\n\n“This is \n\n“That happens sometimes around 10% of the time, so it’s not trivial. And that’s why I think the longer-term Tamiflu continues to be favored – that and the side effect of diarrhea,” he said. “So, Tamiflu tends to be recommended more frequently, despite the fact that you do have to take it for five days.”\n\nXofluza resistance has appeared to occur even more frequently in younger children, Dr. Tim Uyeki, chief medical officer of the influenza division at the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said during a call earlier this month of the CDC’s Clinician Outreach and Communication Activity (COCA).\n\n“This emergence of baloxavir resistance is associated with a longer duration of symptoms,” Uyeki said during the call. “Fortunately, transmission of a baloxavir-resistant virus from person to person has been very, very limited. It’s been reported, but it appears to be very uncommon and there’s no circulation of baloxavir-resistant viruses or oseltamivir-resistant viruses in the general population.”\n\nNational influenza experts discussed on the COCA call that Tamiflu or oseltamivir is preferred for treating hospitalized patients and people with progressive illness.\n\nXofluza is not recommended during pregnancy, while breastfeeding, for outpatients with complicated or progressive illness, severely immunosuppressed people or hospitalized patients, because of the lack of information on its use for these groups.\n\nBut there are situations for which Xofluza may be preferred.\n\n“For a patient with known or suspected influenza B, baloxavir has much greater efficacy against influenza B compared to oseltamivir,” Uyeki said during the call, adding that the medication is “generally well tolerated.”\n\n“A single dose of baloxavir is not associated with many side effects and fewer side effects compared to oseltamivir,” he said. “For patients, I think every patient would prefer a single oral dose of baloxavir versus five days, twice-daily of oseltamivir treatment.”\n\nAt the end of the call, Uyeki added that researchers should continue studying the potential benefits of treating flu patients with a combination of antiviral medications, especially those with severe disease.\n\n“I think we need more data for treatment of influenza in hospitalized influenza patients, so severe influenza,” he said. “And for that we need more data for a combination antiviral treatment, for example oseltamivir-plus-baloxavir.”",

    "fullText": "Republican senators have joined Democrats to issue a pointed message to Donald Trump as he prepares to meet with Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky.\n\nZelensky, 47, will travel to Mar-a-Lago on Sunday to discuss a possible peace agreement to end Russia’s war in Ukraine with Trump, 79, who previously tried to bully Ukraine into accepting a U.S.-brokered deal favorable to Vladimir Putin.\n\nAfter Putin, 73, hit Ukraine with hundreds of drones and missiles over Christmas, GOP senators Thom Tillis, Jerry Moran, and John Barrasso, along with Democratic colleagues, offered a reminder that Putin, 73, is a “ruthless murderer.”\n\n“Today’s decision by Putin to launch attacks rather than hold fire is a sobering reminder for us all: Putin is a ruthless murderer who has no interest in peace and cannot be trusted,” reads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee release.\n\nThe senators added, “It bears repeating that President Zelenskyy agreed to a Christmas truce, but Putin declined, yet he directs soldiers to continue to commit brutal crimes of aggression on one of Christianity’s holiest days.”\n\nTillis, 65, a senator from North Carolina, Moran, 71, a senator from Kansas, and Barrasso, 73, a senator from Wyoming, were joined by Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen, Jacky Rosen, Chris Coons, Jeff Merkley, and Chris Van Hollen, as well as Angus King, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats.\n\nThe message was not joined by more MAGA-friendly members of the committee, including its Republican chairman Jim Risch and Texas’ Ted Cruz.\n\nOnce firmly in control of congressional Republicans, Trump’s influence has weakened in recent months as his approval rating has plummeted and the GOP has lost in contests across the country.\n\nThe defeats suggest a path for Democrats to reclaim at least partial control of Congress in the 2026 midterms by flipping the House and even the Senate, leaving Trump to serve the remainder of his second term as a lame-duck president.\n\nMoreover, the trio of Republican senators is largely free from electoral pressure: Tillis is retiring in 2027, Moran faces reelection in 2028, and Barrasso in 2030.\n\nCritics have long accused Trump of playing into Putin’s hands while being hostile towards Ukraine and other traditional allies.\n\nIn recent months, he launched a diplomatic push to end the war, which began with Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022, but his proposed peace plan initially reflected many of Putin’s demands, blindsiding Zelensky and European allies.\n\nThe demands included limitations on Ukraine’s military and, crucially, the surrender of territory to Russia.\n\nLast month, Trump melted down at Ukraine on Truth Social, claiming that Zelensky had shown “ZERO GRATITUDE” in a message echoing his tantrum at their contentious Oval Office meeting in February. Zelensky responded by thanking Trump again.\n\nThe Ukrainian leader announced Thursday that he’d had a “good conversation” with Trump’s special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nHe told reporters Friday that he plans to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine with Trump on Sunday, as well as the “sensitive issue” of possible territorial concessions.\n\nWhile Zelesnky said the 20-point plan under discussion “is about 90% ready,” he cautioned, “Russia constantly looks for reasons not to agree.”",

Bakken, 27, was found dead in his hotel room in the Alpine town of Lavaze in the Trentino region of Italy on Tuesday.

    "fullText": "The performance-enhancing altitude mask that Olympic hopeful Sivert Guttorm Bakken was wearing when he was found dead this week “is not part of the Norwegian Biathlon Association’s organized training programs,” the federation said Friday.\n\nBakken, 27, was found dead in his hotel room in the Alpine town of Lavaze in the Trentino region of Italy on Tuesday.\n\nHe was located at high altitude, with the Lavaze Pass measuring 1,808 meters (nearly 6,000 feet) in elevation.\n\nThe fact Bakken was wearing a device aimed at simulating high-altitude conditions, which can potentially improve endurance, has raised concerns — especially since Bakken was diagnosed with myocarditis, a heart condition, in 2022 and sat out two seasons.\n\n“The use of such equipment is not part of the Norwegian Biathlon Association’s organized training programs. However, we are aware that a few individual athletes have acquired such equipment. Any use must be in line with the guidelines of the Olympic Council. Such use is not in conflict with the Norwegian sports regulations,” the federation said in a statement, adding that it banned the use of such masks immediately after Bakken’s death “until further notice.”\n\nBakken was the reigning European champion in the 10-kilometer sprint and two relays and was preparing to compete in the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics. He had one individual World Cup victory and three in relays.\n\nHe competed as recently as last Sunday in Annecy, France, finishing 20th in a 15-kilometer mass start event. A day earlier, he finished 18th in a 12.5-kilometer pursuit.\n\n“There are currently many rumors and unconfirmed information related to Bakken’s death. Only when we have received a report from the police and forensic authorities in Italy will we be able to comment on what probably happened and the probable cause of death. This will probably not happen until next week,” said Bernt Heiberg, a lawyer employed by the federation.\n\n“We emphasize that although it has been reported that the deceased was wearing an altitude mask when he was found, there is currently no confirmed information about what role this may have played in the death,” Heiberg added, “We would again urge caution in discussing details related to the death that have not been confirmed by the Italian police at this time.”\n\nAn autopsy on Bakken was due to be performed in Italy before his body can be brought home for a funeral.\n\nNorway is the dominant force in biathlon. Its athletes won six golds and 14 medals in the sport at the last Winter Olympics in Beijing nearly four years ago — twice as many second-ranked France in both categories.\n\nAP Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "fullText": "Vladimir Putin’s “keeper of secrets” died on Christmas Day, less than two years after the Russian president fired him.\n\nColonel-General Yuri Sadovenko, 56, died from “heart disease” on Christmas Day in Moscow, according to Russian news outlets. The Sun reports that the Ukrainian-born Sadovenko was close to former Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu.\n\nSadovenko served as the deputy defense minister up until he and Shoigu were ousted in May 2024 as part of a massive shakeup at the Kremlin. Shoigu, to whom Sadavenko had reportedly acted as a “gatekeeper,” is now the secretary of Russia’s security council.\n\nSadavenko, who had been sanctioned by Britain and other western states, reportedly showed no signs of ill health before his death.\n\nHe had previously been embroiled in scandal after his wife, Maria Kitaeva, left him for another deputy defense minister, Timur Ivanov, according to The Sun.\n\nIvanov, 50, was arrested in April 2024 and convicted in July 2025 on charges of embezzlement and money laundering, receiving a 13-year prison sentence, the Associated Press reported.\n\nSince the Russia-Ukraine war began in February 2022, numerous top government officials have died under suspicious or sudden circumstances.\n\nOn Monday, a funeral was held in Moscow for Stanislav Orlov, 44, the head of a notorious volunteer brigade of neo-Nazi football hooligans who have fought in Ukraine.\n\nIndependent Russian news outlets have reported that Orlov, nicknamed the “Spaniard,” was ambushed and shot by Moscow’s own security forces earlier this month, according to The Guardian.\n\nOrlov’s death adds to a growing list of Russian military and civilian leaders who have died, most notably Yevgeny Prigozhin, the head of the Wagner mercenaries.\n\nPrigozhin, 62, was killed in a plane crash in August 2023, weeks after he led an insurrection against Putin. He had once been close enough to the Russian dictator to earn the nickname “Putin’s chef.”\n\nIn July this year, Putin sacked Transport Minister Roman Starovoit, 53, who was found dead hours later in a park with a gunshot wound to the head. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nOn the same day, Andrei Korneichuk, 42, another transportation official who had worked closely with Starovoit, collapsed and died of what was said to be a heart attack.\n\nOther deaths have long sparked jokes about staying away from windows and seen a series of former high-ranking officials being suddenly found dead stories below where they were last seen.\n\nHowever not all sudden deaths are equal. Ukraine has been able to assassinate several leading Russian military figures many hundreds of miles behind enemy lines in recent months.\n\nLast week, a top general, Lt. Gen. Fanil Sarvarov, died after a bomb exploded under his car. The Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation believes Ukraine could be behind the blast.",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Men who were part of the group of Venezuelan migrants that the United States government transferred earlier this year to a prison in El Salvador demanded justice on Friday, days after a federal judge in Washington ruled that the Trump administration must give them legal due process.\n\nThe men told reporters in Venezuela’s capital that they hope legal organizations can push their claims in court. Their press conference was organized by Venezuela’s government, which had previously said it had retained legal services for the immigrants.\n\nOn Monday, a federal judge ordered the U.S. government to give legal due process to the 252 Venezuelan men, either by providing court hearings or returning them to the U.S. The ruling opens a path for the men to challenge the Trump administration’s allegation that they are members of the Tren de Aragua gang and subject to removal under an 18th century wartime law.\n\nThe men have repeatedly said they were physically and psychologically tortured while at the notorious Salvadoran prison.\n\n“Today, we are here to demand justice before the world for the human rights violations committed against each of us, and to ask for help from international organizations to assist us in our defense so that our human rights are respected and not violated again,” Andry Blanco told reporters in Caracas, where roughly two dozen of the migrants gathered Friday.\n\nSome of the men shared the daily struggles they now face — including fear of leaving their home or encountering law enforcement — as a consequence of what they said were brutal abuses while in prison. The men did not specify what justice should look like in their case, but not all are interested in returning to the U.S.\n\n“I don’t trust them,” Nolberto Aguilar said of the U.S. government.\n\nThe men were flown to El Salvador in March. They were sent to their home country in July as part of a prisoner swap between the Trump administration and the government of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nCamilla Fabri, Venezuelan vice minister of foreign affairs for international communications, said Maduro's government is working with a bar association in the U.S. and “all human rights organizations to prepare a major lawsuit against Trump and the United States government, so that they truly acknowledge all the crimes they have committed against” the men.",

Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, and Congress passed a law the following year naming the center as a living memorial to him.\n\nAccording to the White House, Trump's handpicked board approved the renaming, which scholars have said violates the law. Kennedy niece Kerry Kennedy has vowed to remove Trump’s name from the building once he leaves office, and former House historian Ray Smock is among those who say any changes would have to be approved by Congress.\n\nThe law explicitly prohibits the board of trustees from making the center into a memorial to anyone else, and from putting another person’s name on the building’s exterior.",

    "fullText": "A federal judge this week canceled the trial of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, the Salvadoran man who was mistakenly deported, and scheduled a hearing on whether the prosecution is being vindictive in pursuing a human smuggling case against him.\n\nAbrego Garcia has become a centerpiece of the debate over immigration after the Trump administration deported him in March to a notorious prison in El Salvador. Facing mounting public pressure and a court order, the Trump administration brought him back to the U.S. in June, but only after issuing an arrest warrant on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.\n\nAbrego Garcia has denied the allegations, and argued that prosecutors are vindictively and selectively targeting him. Judge Waverly D. Crenshaw, Jr. wrote in Tuesday’s order that Abrego Garcia had enough evidence to hold a hearing on the topic, which Crenshaw scheduled for Jan. 28.\n\nAt that hearing, prosecutors will have to explain their reasoning for charging Abrego Garcia, Crenshaw wrote, and if they fail in that, the charges could be dismissed.\n\nWhen Abrego Garcia was pulled over in 2022, there were nine passengers in the car, and the officers discussed among themselves their suspicions of smuggling. However, Abrego Garcia was eventually allowed to continue driving with only a warning.\n\nA Department of Homeland Security agent previously testified that he did not begin investigating the traffic stop until after the U.S. Supreme Court said in April that the Trump administration had to work to bring Abrego Garcia from El Salvador, where he was deported.\n\nYears earlier, Abrego Garcia had been granted protection from deportation to his home country after a judge found he faced danger there from a gang that targeted his family. That order allowed Abrego Garcia, who has an American wife and child, to live and work in the U.S. under Immigration and Customs Enforcement supervision.\n\nMembers of President Donald Trump’s administration have accused Abrego Garcia of being a member of the MS-13 gang, but he has vehemently denied the accusations and has no criminal record.\n\nAbrego Garcia's defense attorney and the U.S. attorney's office in Nashville did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

    "fullText": "In the Department of Justice’s latest release of files related to its investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, prison notes share more insight into Epstein's mental state while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges\n\nEpstein died by suicide in his cell on Aug. 10, 2019, but a suicide risk assessment form dated Aug. 1, 2019 states, \"He said he is Jewish and he said in his religion suicide is against the religion\"\n\nThe DOJ has released a trove of files relating to the Epstein probe, many of which have been redacted\n\nDays before Jeffrey Epstein died by suicide in 2019, the sex offender claimed he would never take his own life because, he said, suicide is forbidden in his Jewish faith.\n\nIn the Department of Justice’s latest release of files related to its Epstein investigation, prison notes from his time at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York City — where he was held while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges — offer a closer look at his mental state.\n\nThe notes mentioned a possible suicide attempt on July 23, 2019. According to the notes, Epstein told an interviewers that \"he could not remember what happened\" on the day in question \"because of his \" 'sleep apnea.'\"\n\nDuring a psychological observation from July 26, 2019, it was written that Epstein \"does not like pain and never attempt (sic) to harm himself.\"\n\nA suicide risk assessment form dated Aug. 1, 2019, stated, \"He said he is Jewish and he said in his religion suicide is against the religion,\" per the report. \"Overall, his current protective factors override his risk factors for suicidality. He is currently psychologically stable. He denied feeling hopeless. He is reporting positive future plans and reasons to live for.\"\n\nThe report listed Epstein's \"overall acute suicide risk\" as \"low.\"\n\nThe notes also show Epstein denied having suicidal ideation on Aug. 8, 2019 — two days before he was found hanged in his cell. His death was ruled a suicide.\n\nThe DOJ has released a trove of files relating to the Epstein probe, many of which have been redacted. Congress passed the Epstein Files Transparency Act in November, mandating the release of the investigation materials. President Donald Trump signed the law despite initially opposing it.\n\nThe law permitted the DOJ to leave out or redact certain materials, including information that would potentially identify victims.\n\nTrump's name is found several times in the files and he can be seen in a picture with Epstein. The photo was one of several removed from the DOJ's website before it was restored following backlash.\n\nUpon the release of the latest batch of materials, the DOJ said the files \"contain untrue and sensationalist claims made against President Trump.\"\n\nWant to keep up with the latest crime coverage? \n\nAlso in different images were several well-known individuals, including former President Bill Clinton, Bill Gates, Michael Jackson and Kevin Spacey.\n\nEpstein's longtime co-conspirator, Ghislaine Maxwell, is serving a 20-year federal prison sentence after a sex trafficking conviction.",

    "description": "Anduril COO Matt Grimm said that he sorts for the most recent, unread Slack messages and reads them in his downtime.",
    "fullText": "How to weed through Slack's never-ending parade of pings? Anduril's COO has some advice.\n\nMatt Grimm has overseen the defense technology company since its starting days. He cofounded Anduril with Palmer Luckey, Brian Schimpf, Trae Stephens, and Joseph Chen. Before Anduril, Grimm worked at Palantir.\n\nIn a walkaround interview with Sourcery, Grimm said that he often popped into Slack channels where employees didn't expect to see him.\n\n\"They will see me chirp in on some random thread in some random channel,\" Grimm said. \"People will be like, 'How the hell did you see this?'\"\n\nGrimm said he sorts his Slack messages by both unread and most recent. When he's between meetings, walking between buildings, or has five minutes to spare, he said he'll read the messages in that order.\n\nThe strategy isn't \"foolproof,\" he said, and with about 7,000 employees at Anduril, he said he can't read every message. This method is for reading through channels. If something really needs his attention, Grimm said he trusts that he'll receive a direct message.\n\n\"It works enough to get the pulse of what's going on,\" he said.\n\nOther corporate leaders have their own Slack strategy. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei sends long-form Slack essays that fuel debate.\n\n\"You can go back and read all the past ones, and it tells the history of Anthropic,\" said Sholto Douglas, a Member of the Technical Staff at the AI firm.\n\nOthers intentionally set a distance. Canva CEO Melanie Perkins doesn't have Slack on her phone, so she can \"actually tune out\" when she shuts her laptop. If there's an emergency, someone will call her, she said.\n\nSlack cofounder Cal Henderson told Business Insider that his three biggest tips for using the workplace communications app are ranking channels, setting strict response hours, and experimenting with video clips to replace meetings.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Slack users can also receive their own form of Wrapped by checking who sent the most messages in their workspace.\n\nIn the Sourcery interview, Grimm acknowledged that it was impossible to read every single Slack message sent across Anduril's channels.\n\n\"We're in like 14 time zones,\" Grimm said. \"They're just all day, every day, all the time.\"",

    "fullText": "It looks like you may soon be able to change that old email address you made in high school.\n\nGoogle account users have long been unable to change their email addresses without creating a whole new account, but Google seems to be quietly rolling out an option to update them. That's according to a support page published by the company, which outlines a new process to change the email or username used to identify your account.\n\nThe update on Google's account help page says certain account holders can now change their @gmail.com address without losing access to their data or services. The feature was first reported in the Google Pixel Hub Telegram group in a message that said the update is being gradually rolled out to users. As of Friday morning, the modified instructions were available on the Hindi version of Google's support page.\n\nThe support page suggests this option is currently only available in some regions, including Hindi-speaking areas.\n\nAccording to a translated version of the Hindi support page, the new email must end in @gmail.com, and it can only be changed up to three times. Once the address has been changed, it's irreversible.\n\nTo make the change, you would visit your Google Account page, click \"Personal Info,\" and go to the \"Email\" section, according to the Telegram message.\n\nIt's unclear when it will roll out more widely, and Google didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. As of Friday morning, the English support page said usernames ending in @gmail.com usually can't be changed.\n\nOnce the change is made, the Hindi page said, your old Gmail address will be used as an alias to receive emails. You can reuse your old Google account email address at any time, but you can't create a new Gmail address for the next 12 months.\n\nYou can sign in to Google services like Gmail, YouTube, Google Play, or Drive with your old or new email address.",

    "description": "From live shopping startup Whatnot to AI music platform Suno, meet the creator economy startups that raised massive deals in 2025.",
    "fullText": "The creator economy is riding an AI-fueled high.\n\nIn 2025, eight startups building artificial intelligence tools to automate the content creation process each announced at least $50 million in funding — a combined $1.2 billion — from venture capital and private equity investors.\n\nSynthesia, a generative AI video startup based in London, confirmed its $180 million funding round in January, while ElevenLabs, a text-to-voice startup, closed a $180 million Series C round. Other AI startups, like Moonvalley, Krea, and Higgsfield, also announced sizable investments this year.\n\nWhile AI is dominating investor interest, the topic still carries friction within the creator economy. Some of these AI startups, which offer features such as human-like avatars, run the risk of posing a threat to content creators themselves. Influencer marketing, still the primary financial engine of the creator economy, has yet to reach a consensus on how and when AI should be utilized.\n\nTop creators aren't sitting by idly for AI to take over. YouTuber MrBeast and his team initially sought to raise $200 million earlier this year at a $5 billion valuation, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. The MrBeast team declined to comment on the fundraise.\n\nIt's not just AI that's attracting giant checks from VCs.\n\nSocial commerce startups building live shopping and affiliate marketing platforms are also raking in funding. Whatnot, a platform where people sell on stream in categories like fashion and collectibles, such as Pokémon Cards or Labubus, raised a total of $490 million across two later-stage rounds this year. The social shopping platform was most recently valued at $11.5 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, ShopMy, an affiliate marketing platform, continues to gain market share in the influencer marketing space. The startup raised a total of $147.5 million in funding this year.\n\nUS social commerce sales are expected to cross $100 billion next year, according to estimates from EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company. The category is gaining steam in the US, fueled in part by the growth of TikTok Shop.\n\nThis year's fundraising blitz for creator AI and social commerce startups follows similar buzz for the categories in 2024 when investors threw money at startups like Captions, Flip, and OpusClip. Several startups in those business areas, including ElevenLabs and ShopMy, raised money two years in a row.\n\nBusiness Insider analyzed 2025 fundraising data from PitchBook and other industry sources to highlight the biggest creator industry investment rounds from the year. We're highlighting 13 startups that raised $50 million or more in 2025; combined, their funding crossed $1.9 billion. We focused on companies whose products significantly impact the businesses and content creation processes of creators and their partners.\n\nHere are 13 creator economy startups that raised some of the largest rounds in 2025, in alphabetical order:",

    "fullText": "Losing a parent is difficult enough. But on top of planning a funeral and taking care of final expenses, surviving family members have to handle the belongings left behind, a Herculean task that leaves little space to grieve.\n\nMy mom, Melinda Nicholson, is doing things differently.\n\nFor the past few years, she has been practicing Swedish death cleaning to help me navigate her eventual passing, from organizing important documents to passing down heirlooms. It sounds grim, but it's bringing us both a surprising amount of peace and comfort.\n\nBeing a police officer for 21 years took a toll on my mom's health, forcing her into early retirement. While she does not have any life-threatening diagnoses, her experiences showed her the fragility of life and that time waits for no one.\n\n\"I was 15 when my daddy died,\" my mom recalls. \"I remember there was so much he left behind, and after he was gone, it felt like vultures swooping in to take whatever they wanted. I didn't get to keep much that belonged to him.\"\n\nOne item she wishes she had inherited from her dad was a pearl-handled revolver, but it disappeared following his death. She recently found several of his belongings among her mother's possessions, including a watch, a Shriners' ring, and his military photos.\n\nHer mom handled her dad's affairs. In 2001, it was her turn to become the custodian of a life that had been left behind.\n\nHaving gone through the process herself, she knew what a burden it could be and didn't want to leave that burden for me or my sister.\n\nMy mom has been going through boxes and closets gradually and has developed a system. She offers items to me or my sister first. I've been given her anniversary ring from my dad, a ring from her parents, dishes, and family photos. My sister has also received jewelry, dishes, and a water pitcher. She has given photos and trinkets to her cousins and grandchildren.\n\nShe donates unwanted items to charity organizations. Other items, such as an old time-keeping book from a now-defunct mill where her mother used to work, were donated to the county history museum.\n\nSwedish death cleaning led both of us down our family history's rabbit holes as we sorted items together. Photos from multiple generations triggered memories and stories. I got a family history lesson and felt closer to those who came before me, even people I never met.\n\nIt's also given us opportunities to spend more time together, talking about things that rarely come up in everyday conversations. It's comforting to know that I'll have special reminders of her for the rest of my life, things that won't get tossed to the wayside in the aftermath of her passing.\n\nTo anyone considering Swedish death cleaning, Melinda offers advice: \"Don't wait, even if you think you're in good health. Start with a single box, then a closet, then a whole room, just don't wait.\"",

    "description": "As a snow storm heads toward the New York City area, airlines are delaying and canceling thousands of flights.",
    "fullText": "A winter storm expected to hit the Northeast is causing thousands of flight delays and cancellations.\n\nThe National Weather Service has issued a winter storm warning for areas around New York City, extending into Connecticut and New Jersey. The service expects heavy snow accumulations between six and nine inches.\n\nAbout 1,400 flights in the US have been canceled, as of 2:20 p.m. ET, according to flight-tracking service FlightAware. Over 5,100 US flights have been delayed, per the service.\n\nAffected travel hubs, including New York's John F. Kennedy, LaGuardia, and Newark Liberty airports, have begun issuing weather warnings.\n\nSome airlines have begun offering solutions to travelers affected by the storm. JetBlue, Delta, and Southwest have all waived fare differences for those changing flights from airports around the New York metropolitan area.\n\nThe delays and cancellations come during a high-density travel period around the winter holiday. AAA projected that 8.03 million Americans would fly domestically between December 20 and January 1.\n\nHere is the best advice for what to do if your flight is disrupted.\n\nAccording to the Department of Transportation, there is no law requiring US airlines to compensate passengers for disruptions caused by uncontrollable events, such as weather. That also includes air traffic control delays.\n\nThe only rule carriers must follow is to refund customers in the event of cancellations, even for non-controllable events. And that does not mean travel credits or vouchers — it must be cash, and includes any add-ons, such as bags or seats.\n\nBut carriers do not owe meals, hotel rooms, or financial compensation for storm-related cancellations or delays — because the cause is the weather, not the airline.\n\nPassengers are still entitled to a refund or rebooking on the same airline, but carriers are not required to provide additional accommodations or rebook on another airline.\n\nIf you choose to travel but your flight is delayed or canceled, ask the airline for the reason — ideally in writing — so you know what you're entitled to. Airlines have different policies for disruptions they control, like crew or maintenance issues.\n\nThe DoT's Airline Customer Service Dashboard — launched in 2022 — shows what the 10 largest US airlines promise in those cases, including rebookings, meal vouchers, and hotel accommodations.\n\nWhen a flight delay or cancellation is announced, expect people to flock to the nearest customer service line for assistance, and for the phone lines to clog.\n\nWait times can be painfully long, and the best alternatives will likely go quickly. However, some airlines offer the option to rebook on their website or mobile app and waive any fees, making it sometimes easier to make changes online than in person.\n\nIf all available options are exhausted, have a plan B, such as waiting to speak with a live agent, contacting the airline through social media, or booking a hotel for the night.\n\nDirect messaging on Facebook or Twitter can actually serve as a virtual placeholder, and you may hear back via chat before speaking to a live agent.\n\nHere are the phone numbers for each airline:\n\nFor controllable delays or cancellations that result in a customer waiting at least three hours for a new flight or requiring an overnight stay, several airlines will offer meal or hotel vouchers.\n\nCarriers offering both are Alaska Airlines, Allegiant Air, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, JetBlue Airways, Southwest Airlines, Spirit Airlines, and United Airlines, per the DoT dashboard.\n\nFrontier Airlines is the only carrier that does not offer accommodations in the event of an overnight delay or cancellation, but it will provide a meal voucher.\n\nFor US airlines not listed on the dashboard, or in cases where the disruption is uncontrollable (like because of a winter storm), or if the compensation is unclear, simply ask.\n\nIt never hurts to request a meal or hotel during flight disruptions, and you might get lucky with a goodwill gesture from the carrier.\n\nSeveral major banks offer credit cards that come with travel insurance, like Chase's Sapphire Reserve or American Express' Platinum Card. Both offer trip protection, meaning customers who purchased their flight with that specific card can reap the benefits.\n\nFor example, in the case of a major storm system, it's likely many passengers will end up stranded in random cities across the US.\n\nHowever, banks with travel insurance included can reimburse cardholders for unexpected expenses outside their control, including hotel, meal, and transportation costs.\n\nTravel insurance does not apply in all circumstances, like short delays, so be sure to check your policy before making a claim — but it also doesn't hurt to make the claim anyway, even if the answer is no.\n\nDuring the holidays, it's easy to lose sight of your purpose — seeing friends and family or simply getting away from home for a few days.\n\nHowever, delays and cancellations are inevitable. Don't spend all day sitting around waiting — give yourself a cut-off time. Once that moment passes, consider alternative means of getting to your destination, such as driving or taking a bus or train (which may also be covered by travel insurance).\n\nIf you are stuck in another city and have no other option but to stay in a hotel or wait at the airport, decide how you want to spend your time and make a plan.\n\nEditor's note: This article was originally published in 2023 and has been updated.",

    "description": "Every holiday season, Tom Cruise sends a white chocolate coconut bundt cake to a group of famous friends. The cake is available on Goldbelly for $140.",
    "fullText": "Karen Doan, the self-taught baker behind the famous cake, revealed during a 2021 interview with Spectrum News 1 that Holmes, who was married to Cruise from 2006 to 2012, had learned about Doan's Bakery from Diane Keaton while they were working on the 2008 film \"Mad Money.\"\n\n\"When Tom and Katie had a big party at their new home in Beverly Hills, we did all the cakes,\" Doan said. \"They loved it.\"\n\nCruise and Holmes' marriage didn't last, but his relationship with Doan's Bakery has continued for over a decade.\n\n\"This has become so popular that I would say when the phone rings, 80% of the people, that's what they want,\" Doan said about the coconut cake in 2021.\n\nWhether it's a bouquet of flowers from Beyoncé or some Meghan Markle marmalade, the A-list loves to show off their exclusive gifts on Instagram. Celebrities, they're just like us!\n\nThe \"Tom Cruise Cake\" is no different. Stars like Mindy Kaling and Glen Powell have posted pictures of their cakes, and the famous dessert is a frequent discussion on the talk show circuit. Celebrity gossip blogs even publish lists detailing which celebrities — including Jon Hamm, the Fanning sisters, and Angela Bassett — make the cut every year.\n\nThe cake itself has also won high praise. Kirsten Dunst told Graham Norton in 2016 that it was the \"best coconut cake I've ever had in my life,\" and Tom Hanks called it \"off-the-scale fantastic\" during a 2023 video for Mythical Kitchen. The actor loves the cake so much that he said it would be one of the dishes he'd want for his last meal on earth.\n\nI don't think I've ever tried a cake with so much hype. Clearly, it had a lot to live up to.\n\nI ordered the cake on December 18 and selected two-day shipping, which was an additional $35. There were also options for five-day delivery ($20) and six-day delivery (free). Unfortunately, due to high demand, you now need to join a waitlist for the cake on Goldbelly, although those in LA can still purchase it from Doan's Bakery for the much cheaper cost of $66.\n\nThe dessert, which ships nationwide, was delivered frozen with dry ice. The cake itself was individually wrapped in plastic, topped with a bright-green bow, and tucked inside a Doan's Bakery box.\n\nThe hefty 10-inch cake — which serves 12-16 people and weighs 3 pounds — can last in the refrigerator for up to five days or in the freezer for four months.\n\nCobie Smulders told Jimmy Fallon in 2019 that she'll \"slowly chip away\" at the dessert until March.\n\nWith its generous dusting of coconut flakes, the bundt cake makes for an angelic and festive centerpiece. But, at first, it was hard to appreciate the flavor.\n\nThis is already a dense and buttery cake, and it hadn't fully defrosted after 24 hours in the fridge. Paired with the cream cheese frosting, the texture was really heavy. My parents and I weren't super impressed, but we decided to hold our opinion and give the cake another day to fully defrost.\n\nThis is definitely a maximalist cake — something Doan said was always part of her ethos.\n\n\"I don't skimp on ingredients,\" she said during the Spectrum News 1 segment in 2021. \"Everyone says, 'Less is more, Karen,' because I want to put more white chips. I want to put more coconut!\"\n\nI'm glad she didn't listen when she created this cake recipe, especially when it came to the white chocolate chunks. Their texture adds just a hint of delicious crunch to the cake, and there's a warmth to the flavor that helps cut through the intense punch of sweetness. The toasted flakes are also a nice touch, adding depth without giving each bite an overwhelming coconut flavor.\n\nWhen I woke up for breakfast one morning this week, I found myself craving another slice of the cake. It had surprisingly grown on me. My parents agreed, although they're not convinced it's worth the price.\n\n\"I'd eat it again, if someone sent it as a gift,\" my dad said.",

    "description": "According to the \"Misery Map,\" which tracks real-time flight disruptions, there have been hundreds of delays and cancellations.",
    "fullText": "A turbulent year for air travel isn't over yet.\n\nSnow and rainstorms hit multiple states on both coasts on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day, and are now heading for the Northeast, including New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. Travellers are now having a difficult time getting home as major airports see mass delays and cancellations.\n\nAccording to the \"Misery Map,\" published by FlightAware, which tracks real-time flight disruptions, there have been over 1,000 delays and more than 350 cancellations across the largest US airports as of 6:45 p.m. ET on Friday.\n\nHere's a look at the latest flight disruptions, and when you may expect to fly if your flight has been canceled.\n\nThe storm that first hit the Midwest is coming for the East Coast. New York City is set to see the most snow it has seen in years, since the last time it saw at least 4 inches of snow was January 2022. New Jersey and upstate New York will see similar weather conditions.\n\nThe NYC Emergency Management said in a press release that \"snow is expected to develop Friday afternoon and intensify into steady, accumulating snow Friday night.\" The National Weather Service has forecast 3 to 7 inches of snow with locally higher amounts possible.\n\nAccording to FlightAware, JFK International Airport is experiencing 369 cancellations, with 210 on Friday alone. The situation at Newark Liberty International Airport is also not optimistic, with 244 cancellations and counting.\n\nBased on the Misery Map, flights from airports around NYC to Chicago, Detroit, and Denver are seeing the highest number of delays and cancellations.\n\nThe West Coast is slowly recovering from an exceptionally wet Christmas.\n\nOver the past two days, most residents of California have received at least one weather warning as an atmospheric river accompanied by high winds, floods, and mudslides hit the Golden State. The NWS said that this Christmas season is the wettest one Los Angeles has experienced in 54 years.\n\nThe San Francisco International Airport said that 153 flights had been delayed on Friday morning due to windy conditions. To make matters worse, the police briefly shut down Terminal 1 due to a \"suspicious package,\" but then reopened it without explanation. By midday, FlightAware reports that a total of 381 flights from SFO have been delayed.\n\nAccording to the Misery Map, flights from the Los Angeles International Airport to Seattle, Salt Lake City, Denver, and the East Coast are all experiencing disruptions. FlightAware counted a total of 283 delays and 41 cancellations.\n\nThe disruptions come at the end of a tough year for air travel.\n\nHigh-profile plane accidents, including when an American Airlines Flight crashed into a Black Hawk helicopter, and the firing of hundreds of FAA employees by the White House DOGE office, triggered a newfound fear of flying among some Americans earlier this year.\n\nThe subsequent government shutdown also led to flying snags this year, as air traffic controllers who were left without pay called in sick, and some airports were paralyzed.",

With this in mind, you can skip any rewards that just don't matter much to you right now--though it's worth pointing out you will still need to purchase a certain number of items from the deck to unlock subsequent pages.\n\nIf you're excited to dive into the Goalie Deck and start reaping its rewards--including the new hockey-themed outfit, which is pretty rad--we've got you covered ahead of time. Keep scrolling below for every reward from the Goalie Deck in Arc Raiders.",

    "fullText": "How did we allow this to happen?\n\nIn this time of unrelenting, often unprecedented cruelty and lawlessness, I’m grateful for Nation readers like you.\n\nSo many of you have taken to the streets, organized in your neighborhood and with your union, and showed up at the ballot box to vote for progressive candidates. You’re proving that it is possible—to paraphrase the legendary Patti Smith—to redeem the work of the fools running our government.\n\nAnd as we head into 2026, I promise that The Nation will fight like never before for justice, humanity, and dignity in these United States.\n\nAt a time when most news organizations are either cutting budgets or cozying up to Trump by bringing in right-wing propagandists, The Nation’s writers, editors, copy editors, fact-checkers, and illustrators confront head-on the administration’s deadly abuses of power, blatant corruption, and deconstruction of both government and civil society.\n\nWe couldn’t do this crucial work without you.\n\nThrough the end of the year, a generous donor is matching all donations to The Nation’s independent journalism up to $75,000. But the end of the year is now only days away.\n\nTime is running out to have your gift doubled. Don’t wait—donate now to ensure that our newsroom has the full $150,000 to start the new year.\n\nAnother world really is possible. Together, we can and will win it!",
