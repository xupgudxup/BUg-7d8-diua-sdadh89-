    "fullText": "January is a make or break month as the Gunners compete on five fronts in an exceptionally congested period.\n\nHere are the five trophies, ranked by importance and prestige, and an honest assessment of how achievable each one is.\n\nEffectively the Intercontinental Cup for women’s teams, this competition is reserved for the absolute elite, with only continental champions from the six confederations allowed to take part.\n\nUntil the first Women’s Club World Cup arrives in 2028, it is arguably the most prestigious annual trophy available in the women’s game.\n\nThere are only two matches to win it.\n\nFirst, Arsenal must beat AS FAR of Morocco, four days after the Women’s Super League match against Chelsea at Brentford.\n\nVictory there would set up a final at the Emirates Stadium against either Gotham FC of the United States or Corinthians of Brazil.\n\nArsenal must defeat OH Leuven over two legs in the play-off, having beaten them 3-0 away in the league phase in December. Should they progress, a quarter-final against Chelsea would likely follow.\n\nIn the semi-finals, either OL Lyonnes or Wolfsburg or Juventus would await.\n\nThe final on 23 May could feature one of six teams: Atlético de Madrid, Manchester United, Bayern München, Paris FC, Real Madrid or Barcelona.\n\nRetaining the trophy will be a huge challenge, but winning it last year required a Herculean effort, so it cannot be ruled out.\n\nArsenal are third in the league, eight points behind Manchester City. Their title chances look remote, but second place remains achievable and must be the target, with Chelsea only two points ahead.\n\nFinishing second is crucial as it brings direct qualification for the Champions League group phase. Matches this month against Manchester United and Manchester City at home, and Chelsea away, will be decisive.\n\nFive matches stand between Arsenal and Wembley. The first is a home tie against Aston Villa on 18 January at Meadow Park. From there, the luck of the draw will determine whether the team can reach the final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday 31 May.\n\nTwo more wins would secure this trophy. First comes Manchester United at Meadow Park on Wednesday 21 January, with a 7pm kick-off.\n\nThe final, against either Manchester City or Chelsea, will be played at Bristol City on Sunday 15 March with a 2.15pm kick-off.\n\nPlayers selected for the Asian Cup would miss that final.\n\nOverall, there are five trophies available. Two can realistically be targeted, one is very unlikely, one will be extremely tough, and one would require a mammoth effort to retain.\n\nThe biggest concern is the relentless schedule across all five competitions.\n\nGames are coming thick and fast, rotation options will be limited, and the physical toll is likely to be felt towards the end of January and into February, until the next international break.",

    "fullText": "Marc Guehi's future has been a consistent topic of conversation since the 2025-26 season got underway.\n\nThroughout most of the summer transfer window, most fans, pundits and journalists thought that the centre-back would become a Liverpool player but right at the last minute, Steve Parish pulled out of the deal.\n\nThis led to even more questions being asked about his future with other clubs across the world having their interest piqued due to his contract expiry in June 2026.\n\nHowever, it now seems like Manchester City are about to enter the fray and potentially make a move for the Crystal Palace captain.\n\nThat is, according to a report from BBC Sport journalist Sami Mokbel who took to X and stated the following.\n\n\"Man City explore move for Crystal Palace captain Marc Guehi for January,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Follows injuries to Ruben Dias & Josko Gvardiol. No final decision from City over formal approach but interest has accelerated.\n\n\"Liverpool and Bayern Munich also interested.\"\n\nEven though Liverpool conducted Guehi's medical in summer, they have since chose against making another move for the Englishman.\n\nIndeed, they were likely waiting until they could negotiate a free transfer for the centre-back but now that Man City are showing an interest in the defender, Hughes' hand may be forced into making a premature move.\n\nIf his transfer is sanctioned, the Reds would likely pay much more than what he's worth due to the interest shown in him by other clubs and their desperation for new centre-backs.\n\nOf course, if the fee ends up exceeding the £35 million that was agreed upon in the summer, Liverpool would likely walk away.\n\nHowever, if they want to beat Pep Guardiola to the transfer, they'll still have to offer a decent chunk of change, which is likely the main thing putting the Anfield outfit off making a move.\n\nThat is, despite how much he'd end up improving their team.",

    "description": "Neville says Amorim’s decision to speak out against his bosses at Leeds was going to lead to the same outcome ‘whether you work at a football club or at Morrisons",
    "fullText": "Gary Neville says he’s surprised at the timing but not Manchester United’s decision to sack Ruben Amorim as the Red Devils legend broke his silence on the news.\n\nAmorim was dismissed from his managerial post after 14 months in the role, with his explosive rant following United’s 1-1 draw with Leeds on the weekend proving the final straw for the club’s hierarchy.\n\nIt’s since emerged that Amorim had held a meeting with Oscar Berrada and Jason Wilcox on the Friday beforehand, in which the two United chiefs were apparently unimpressed to the Portuguese’s responses to being probed on the team’s formation and selection choices.\n\nNeville highlights that Amorim’s decision to go public with his unhappiness in his post-match press conference at Elland Road was only going to lead to one outcome, regardless of your line of work.\n\n“In the last week, he's decided he doesn't feel supported, or happy,” Neville said, insisting the club were right to meet with the manager after United’s dismal 1-1 draw to rock-bottom Wolves.\n\n“He’s called it on and decided at press conferences to unleash at times, be emotional and do what he does, he's always done it with integrity. The reality of it, when you turn on your bosses, at a football club or at Morrisons, you won't keep your job very long.\n\n“After the Wolves game, it (the meeting) would take place at every single football club. These are conversations that have to happen when disappointing performances come.”\n\nHe added: “I've complimented United... but some of the performances in the last month - losing to 10 men against Everton, the performance with West Ham, everyone is beating West Ham, everyone is beating Wolves, Man United drew with Wolves. The results have been shocking.\n\n“There have been bright sparks. I thought Leeds was a decent performance. The Wolves one, that was the killer game, it was a bad one, that.\"\n\nDespite United’s questionable form combining with Amorim’s act of defiance, Neville was nevertheless surprised at the speed of his dismissal, coming less than 24 hours after the Leeds result.\n\n“It's a surprise it happened this morning, I didn't realise it would happen so quickly. It usually ends one way, try work out what to do. They decided to do it very quickly,” he said.\n\nKey to Amorim’s downfall was a reluctance to move away from his 3-4-2-1 system, staying loyal to the ideology despite persistent poor results and apparent alternatives being available.\n\nNeville called on United to rediscover their “DNA” rather than let managers with a fixed philosophy control their style of play.\n\n“Manchester United must take risks, be courageous and play attacking, aggressive football,” Neville said.\n\n“Ajax will never change for anybody. Barcelona will never change for anybody. I don’t believe Man United should change for anybody. They should play in the way in which they play.\n\n“These managers that have come in are fantastic managers: Louis van Gaal, Jose Mourinho, Erik ten Hag, Ruben Amorim, they're brilliant coaches. You can't say they're not good coaches, but they've all come in with different ideas, different styles of play, different philosophies, and none of them really fit the Manchester United way.\n\n”So for me, the club have to find the manager now who's got experience, who's willing to play fast, entertaining, attacking aggressive football, simple as that.”",

    "fullText": "AS Monaco’s defeat to Olympique Lyonnais has proven costly. Not only did the 3-1 loss to Paulo Fonseca’s see them lose further ground in the race for European football, there were also a succession of injuries to key players.\n\nLukas Hradecky did not last long and is expected to miss several weeks with a knee issue, whilst the same goes for Christian Mawissa, who was making his return during the match against OL. The Frenchman has suffered a muscular injury.\n\nHowever, a much more serious injury was sustained by Mohammed Salisu, as confirmed by the club. The Ghana international, Monaco revealed on Monday, has suffered an ACL injury, which will rule him out for the remainder of the campaign.\n\nSalisu had been a regular starter due to the absence of Mawissa and that of Eric Dier. This is the second ACL injury for the Principality club in as many matches. Takumi Minamino suffered the same injury during the win over AJ Auxerre during the last match before the winter break.",

    "fullText": "The Oklahoma Sooners are fully in the swing of transfer portal season in early January, as they're making additions to the roster and seeing former players land at their new schools. The portal officially opened on January 2nd, and it will be open until January 16th.\n\nOne of the latest players to find his new school is former OU defensive back Maliek Hawkins, who has committed to West Virginia. Hawkins is the son of former Oklahoma defensive back Mike Hawkins Sr., who played for the Sooners in 2002 and then played multiple years in the NFL. He's the younger brother of former OU quarterback Michael Hawkins Jr., who started five games in Norman over the last two seasons. Both Hawkins brothers are now headed to Morgantown, with the older Hawkins hoping to win the starting QB job, and the younger Hawkins hoping to crack the rotation at cornerback.\n\nHawkins was a member of Oklahoma's 2025 recruiting class, signing with the Sooners as a three-star recruit. He played in just one game during his true freshman season, and now arrives at WVU as a package deal with his older brother.\n\nDespite the Sooners expecting to return starters Eli Bowen and Courtland Guillory at the CB spots in 2026, the portal exits of Hawkins, Devon Jordan, Gentry Williams, and Kendel Dolby have thinned the depth at that position. With Jacobe Johnson also expected to return, Oklahoma will be looking to add a key rotational cornerback or two in the transfer portal ahead of next year.\n\nWest Virginia adds former Oklahoma DB Maliek Hawkins. #WVU \n\nDetails 👉 https://t.co/Ji956ljZdL pic.twitter.com/fPFBotajHA\n\n— WVSports.com (@WVSportsDotCom) January 5, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @SoonersWire on X, and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions. You can also follow Aaron on X@Aaron_Gelvin.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Sooners Wire: Former Sooners' defensive back commits to West Virginia",

(Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nThe former Juventus, Roma, Milan, Real Madrid and England coach lashed out at the officials following recent decisions and the confusing use of VAR.\n\n“Referees are a mafia. They don’t want to have any former players involved with VAR, those who know the movements in football, those movements that players make to stop themselves, to help themselves,” said Capello.\n\nMADRID, SPAIN – APRIL 20: Fabio Capello attends the Sporting Mixed Zone ahead of Laureus World Sports Awards Madrid 2025 at Palacio De Cibeles on April 20, 2025 in Madrid, Spain.

    "fullText": "Emerald Onion needs your help! We are a U.S. tax-deductible 501(c)(3), and we are fundraising for new server hardware that supports a modern security feature called AMD SEV-SNP, which we discuss in Phase 2 of this post below.\n\nPlease visit emeraldonion.org/donate to donate to our cause. Email donations@emeraldonion.org with any questions!\n\nThroughout 2025, we've been working on a project to strip out unnecessary components from our relay architecture and move towards a philosophy of simplicity. We brought our minimalist relays online in June 2025.\n\nOur new relays use a custom JeOS image based on Alpine Linux. A single relay packs down into a bootable Unified Kernel Image weighing in at just 66 MB. This includes everything the relay needs to function; a kernel, the Tor process, and very little else:\n\nWe build an image for each relay, and deploy it using Terraform to our Proxmox-based hypervisors in Hurricane Electric's Fremont 2 datacenter in California. The relays boot entirely into RAM, with no persistent storage attached to the VMs.\n\nTo update the relays, we build a new set of images and push them out to the Proxmox layer. This gets us very close to the ideal container-like workflow, but with full VMs.\n\nThe small footprint of these relay images allows us to minimise the remote attack surface of our relays, and reduce the risk of a threat actor compromising relay keys.\n\nAs the main function of Tor relays is relaying traffic from Point A to Point B, they lend themselves quite well to this diskless image-based approach. We can get the relays quite close to being “stateless”, but since Tor relays maintain a persistent cryptographic identity, we do need to preserve some state.\n\nA Tor relay can be broken down into only a few files that need to persist across image deployments. These are the only files we need to preserve in order for a relay to maintain its long-term identity:\n\nThe general steps our build process follows are:\n\nSo far, building relays and persisting just the above state has been working very well for our threat model:\n\nWe're currently working on rebuilding our relay identity management system so that relay keys are fetched from an off-site central control plane after boot, and held only in RAM. This will ensure that in the case of relay seizure there is nothing at all held on-disk that might compromise either our users or our relay infrastructure.\n\nAs part of our commitment to the Tor relay operator community, today we have open-sourced the relay orchestration framework we use to manage our live exit relays. Please consider the codebase a continual work in progress. We also commit to doing all future development in the open here.\n\nYou can find the code at: https://code.disobey.net/EmeraldOnion/emerald-relays\n\nWe're quite proud of this year's progress on our minimal relay deployment. We think the work we've done so far does a good job at addressing a number of the threats faced by Tor exit operators.\n\nBut we must accept the reality of being a Tor exit operator in the United States in 2025. More than ever before, it is critically important that we consider the risk posed by our servers being outside of our physical control.\n\nEmerald Onion owns and colocates all our own server equipment, rather than leasing VPS space or equipment owned by third-parties. But this equipment is still located within a datacenter outside of our physical control.\n\nSo we need to build a system that validates that the images built in our trusted infrastructure are the same ones which are relaying Tor users' traffic in production, and that they have not been modified by a compromised physical host.\n\nWhen we plot our current threat model, the impact of this year's work becomes clear. A lot of the threats that a Tor exit operator typically faces are now mitigated in our setup:\n\nIt's clear from the threat model above that there are a number of potential threats faced by Tor exit operators such as Emerald Onion that could be mitigated through the use of SEV-SNP, which we'll explore in the rest of this post.\n\nSince we're using an immutable image-based deployment, we're able to make use of some of the technologies from the world of Confidential Computing (CoCo). In particular, we're looking to make full use of SEV-SNP, which is AMD's implementation of a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).\n\nSEV-SNP (Secure Encrypted Virtualization – Secure Nested Paging) is a technology that allows isolating guest VMs from an untrusted host OS. It's already used for CoCo in environments such as AWS and Google Cloud, but we're looking to continue the approach of owning and colocating all our own hardware by investing in new servers that support this feature. SEV-SNP is available on AMD EPYC from 7003 (Milan) onwards. Our current relays run on EPYC 7002 (Rome) chips.\n\nTypically, SEV-SNP is built to protect workloads against an untrusted cloud provider, as seen in this presentation by AMD's Jeremy Powell in 2022:\n\nIn our case though, we are considering ourselves the untrusted cloud provider as, although we're providing our own hardware, the fact it's outside of our physical control means we can't (and shouldn't) trust it.\n\nSEV-SNP tackles this by creating an environment that requires we only trust the integrity of the underlying CPU, which makes use of an immutable bootrom baked into the silicon at the factory:\n\nWith SEV-SNP, we no longer need to trust the hypervisor, host OS, or the rest of the hardware. We will of course continue to uphold our usual high standards for the security of these components, but re-architecting our Tor exits around Confidential Compute concepts will cut out the majority of the remaining threats we identified in the threat model above.\n\nIt's important to acknowledge that attacks against Trusted Execution Environments do exist, such as TEE.fail. But these attacks require sophisticated attackers with physical access, who need to make themselves very visible in the process. We are aware that the solution being proposed here isn't perfect, and weaknesses will always exist. But we believe that this is a worthwhile step to take, as it substantially raises the bar for an attacker. We are also looking into how we can tie more traditional physical security controls such as rack cameras and chassis intrusion logs into this approach.\n\nWhen we implement our SEV-SNP relays, we will make public our entire build chain — ensuring that relays are built in the open with publicly-available build artifacts. These artifacts can be used by EO to ensure continual attestation of the running relays against the expected values produced by the build system. Longer-term, we aim to investigate the possibility of building an architecture that allows public validation of our relays by anyone, though that is a more challenging piece of work. We welcome collaboration and information sharing with others who have worked in the Confidential Computing space.\n\nPlease remember to visit emeraldonion.org/donate to donate so Emerald Onion can purchase at least three used HPE ProLiant DL325 Gen10 “V2” servers with AMD Epyc 7xx3 CPUs in the new year. That's our goal! Your donation will allow Emerald Onion to perform the necessary security research and deployment of Phase 2 (above) in our Fremont, California datacenter.\n\nWe are also committing to publishing our detailed findings and all our deployment tooling, to help Tor relay operators and other privacy infrastructure operators learn from our work. Thank you so much for considering to donate to help make the Tor network a better, safer place.",

    "fullText": "Higher Education\n\n AI Nudges Syracuse Professors Back Toward Blue Books, In-Class Work\n\n To prevent students from relying on artificial intelligence to write and do homework for them, many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments and having students finish essays in class.\n\n December 23, 2025 • \n Emalyn Muzzy, syracuse.com\n\n Facebook\n\n LinkedIn\n\n Twitter\n\nPrint\n\n Email\n\n (TNS) — Oksana Korol remembers her parents telling her how they took oral exams in college. Professors would give them a problem to solve. They had 10 minutes to think it through, then explain their answer and reasoning.\n\n“That is completely AI-proof,” said Korol, a biology professor at Onondaga Community College.\n\nKorol, like countless other professors in Central New York, has had to change the way she teaches her class and assesses students’ learning due to the ballooning use of generative artificial intelligence. Many, like her, are relying on those old-school techniques to AI-proof their tests and papers.\n\nAs AI continues to push itself into our everyday lives, it has created a culture of do or die for higher education. Professors have to either adapt their classes or risk students using AI to avoid thinking through tough assignments. Universities can offer courses teaching students to think critically about AI or assume young minds already know how to ask tough questions.\n\nIf higher education as a whole does not adapt, it could be left behind as students embrace AI in their studies.\n\nAt the three largest educational institutions in Syracuse — Syracuse University, Le Moyne College and Onondaga Community College — many professors are returning to pre-technology assessments while students use AI to study in futuristic ways.\n\nOCC and SU student handbooks outline how using AI to complete entire assignments and papers is considered plagiarism or academic misconduct. Le Moyne College does not have a college-wide AI policy, although Provost Jim Hannan said the institution is starting the process to create guidance.\n\nWithout uniform guidance from school leadership, it’s often up to professors to figure out how to handle AI. Some professors spend free time teaching themselves how to wield AI in a productive manner. Others side-eye the technology.\n\nAll of them, however, must understand how it impacts their students’ learning.\n\n“We have to learn how to use (AI) first. That arms race is exhausting and overwhelming when our workloads, admittedly, are already pretty heavy,” said OCC professor Michelle Malinovsky.\n\nIN-CLASS ASSESSMENTS MAKE A RETURN\nWhen a student uses an AI prompt generator to write a research paper, there are signs the student didn’t do it themselves. Malinovsky said older AI versions used the same rhetoric model. Le Moyne English professor Ann Ryan said a student’s paper may be too clean.\n\nThere is no true way to prove a student used AI, unless the student accidentally leaves their prompt in the paper or admits to it, said Rubin.\n\nWhile there are AI detection software, most don’t work, Rubin and Malinovsky said. For that reason, SU and OCC do not recommend using the programs.\n\n“It’s incredibly inaccurate. It’s always reactionary and it causes a huge issue in terms of equity and bias,” Malinovsky said.\n\nSU, Le Moyne and OCC either encourage or require professors to decide how they want students to use AI. They each have three similar pre-made policies professors can put into their syllabuses.\n\nThe policies state that AI cannot be used under any circumstance, students can use limited AI or AI can be used freely within reason.\n\n“It’s a first step of allowing faculty to think about the use and letting students know how an individual faculty member plans to allow or not allow on assessment in the classroom,” said SU Chief Digital Officer Jeff Rubin.\n\nWith the traditional research paper becoming harder to assign, many professors are flipping the classroom. For example, Ryan has students writing in class and brainstorming with classmates.\n\n“I’m workshopping papers in class as students are writing them. Traditionally in a literature class you’d say, ‘You got a 12-page paper due in three weeks,’” Ryan said. “So what we’re doing is we’re writing papers in class.”\n\nMalinovsky, who teaches English and is also a librarian, said she has implemented similar practices. She encourages students to send pictures of handwritten assignments.\n\n“(AI) challenges professors to rethink the assessment. Perhaps if they’re worried about AI use, then bring some of that assessment back into the classroom,” Rubin said.\n\nProfessors have also started to make work more reflective. For Ryan’s class, students had to add a one-to-two page coda on how what they learned in class impacted them to their final paper. They then shared that reflection with the class.\n\nLearning assessments appear to be returning to traditional, in-person techniques. Korol said she has done away with online exams and implemented more in-class tests.\n\n“I think that we’re back to the blue books and we’re maybe going back to the oral exams,” Korol at OCC said.\n\nEven with the potential for misuse, AI can be a powerful tool if harnessed correctly. While assessments embrace older techniques, study strategies are flying forward.\n\nMultiple professors said they see students upload class slides or paste class notes into a chatbot and ask it to create study tools like a practice quiz or study questions. Anthropic , the creator of AI bot Claude,analyzed student chatsand found they also use it to troubleshoot coding problems or synthesize complex information.\n\nKorol has gone one step farther and created a prototype AI tutor, where she uploads questions for students to answer. The AI tutor knows not just the correct answer but the important ideas behind it, meaning students can express the answers in different ways.\n\n“The tutor has been specifically told not to give out the answer, and instead it’s been told to keep asking leading questions. And if you read through this conversation, you will see that the hints are getting more and more transparent as we go along,” Korol said.\n\nKorol has not yet used the tutor with students but is trying to figure out how to deploy the app for campus-wide use.\n\nTEACHING ABOUT AI\nSU is taking AI education one step further: it has begun offering classes and a minor about the impact of AI. Beginning in fall 2026, the Maxwell School of Public Affairs will offer the AI Policy minor. Classes include programming and public policy analysis.\n\nThe idea is not to teach students how to create or use AI, but rather to think critically about its real world applications, said program director Johannes Himmelreich.\n\n“AI is going to have significant social impact. This will create policy challenges that require an understanding of the technology as well as the policy analysis skills,” Himmelreich said.\n\nMalinovsky described generative AI as the “wild west.” There are no specific federal regulations on AI, with regulators instead relying on a patchwork of laws. On Dec. 11, President Donald Trump put out an executive order blocking states from creating their own regulations.\n\nHimmelreich wants students to be able to tackle topics such as how to grow AI without destroying the environment, how AI could impact warfare or if AI could be conscious enough to deserve rights.\n\nThe idea of a minor exploring AI has been under discussion since 2020, a couple years before the public explosion of generative AI.\n\n“ChatGPT wasn’t a technological surprise at all. I mean, I’ve been in demos that OpenAI gave for the older models that weren’t a chat interface. And the difference is that OpenAI changed its policy around how accessible they want the technology to be,” Himmelreich said.\n\nThinking critically about AI is a core part of Milton Santiago’s Generative AI Filmmaking class. He launched the three-credit course this past fall, teaching students how to use generative AI in filmmaking while also discussing its impact.\n\n“We can intercept a lot of the ethical and moral questions that surround these tools currently, which actually I think is probably the biggest benefit of the class,” Santiago said. “Students do have to wrestle with questions of where does creativity begin and end? What does authorship actually look like? Is the environmental impact as this technology stands today worth using the tools?”\n\nTeaching about AI is not only happening in classes or studies surrounding the topic. Malinovsky said she talks about AI a lot in her English classes. To help her students better understand why they need to do their own work, she sometimes has students do the work themselves then ask an AI chatbot to do the work. Then the students compare and discuss.\n\nAs generative AI continues to develop, faculty are learning how to use it along with students. Some, like Ryan, are skeptical of its application and try to avoid it while others, like Santiago , spend hours figuring out the best application for students.\n\n“This has shaken up what education does in a way that other technologies haven’t,” Hannan said.",

    "description": "As more workers use AI, a recent study adds to growing evidence the tech doesn’t always deliver on promises of boosted productivity.",
    "fullText": "Sasha Rogelberg is a reporter and former editorial fellow on the news desk at Fortune, covering retail and the intersection of business and popular culture.\n\nIt’s like a new telling of the “Tortoise and the Hare”: A group of experienced software engineers entered into an experiment where they were tasked with completing some of their work with the help of AI tools. Thinking like the speedy hare, the developers expected AI to expedite their work and increase productivity. Instead, the technology slowed them down more. The AI-free tortoise approach, in the context of the experiment, would have been faster.\n\nThe results of this experiment, part of a recent study, came as a surprise to the software developers tasked with using AI—and to the study’s authors, Joel Becker and Nate Rush, technical staff members of nonprofit technology research organization Model Evaluation and Threat Research (METR).\n\nThe researchers enlisted 16 software developers, who had an average of five years of experience, to conduct 246 tasks, each one a part of projects on which they were already working. For half the tasks, the developers were allowed to use AI tools—most of them selected code editor Cursor Pro or Claude 3.5/3.7 Sonnet—and for the other half, the developers conducted the tasks on their own.\n\nBelieving the AI tools would make them more productive, the software developers predicted the technology would reduce their task completion time by an average of 24%. Instead, AI resulted in their task time ballooning to 19% greater than when they weren’t using the technology.\n\n“While I like to believe that my productivity didn’t suffer while using AI for my tasks, it’s not unlikely that it might not have helped me as much as I anticipated or maybe even hampered my efforts,” Philipp Burckhardt, a participant in the study, wrote in a blog post about his experience.\n\nSo where did the hares veer off the path? The experienced developers, in the midst of their own projects, likely approached their work with plenty of additional context their AI assistants did not have, meaning they had to retrofit their own agenda and problem-solving strategies into the AI’s outputs, which they also spent ample time debugging, according to the study.\n\n“The majority of developers who participated in the study noted that even when they get AI outputs that are generally useful to them—and speak to the fact that AI generally can often do bits of very impressive work, or sort of very impressive work—these developers have to spend a lot of time cleaning up the resulting code to make it actually fit for the project,” study author Rush told Fortune.\n\nOther developers lost time writing prompts for the chatbots or waiting around for the AI to generate results.\n\nThe results of the study contradict lofty promises about AI’s ability to transform the economy and workforce, including a 15% boost to U.S. GDP by 2035 and eventually a 25% increase in productivity.  In fact, many companies have yet to see a return on AI investments. An MIT report published in August found out of 300 AI deployments, only 5% achieved rapid revenue acceleration.  Only 6% of companies fully trust AI to run core business practices, according to a Harvard Business Review Analytic Services research report published last month.\n\nBut Rush and Becker have shied away from making sweeping claims about what the results of their study mean for the future of AI.\n\nFor one, the study’s sample was small and non-generalizable, including only a specialized group of people to whom these AI tools were brand new. The study also measures technology at a specific moment in time, the authors said, not ruling out the possibility that AI tools could be developed in the future that would indeed help developers enhance their workflow.\n\nThe purpose of the study was, broadly speaking, to pump the brakes on the torrid implementation of AI in the workplace and elsewhere, acknowledging more data about AI’s actual effects need to be made known and accessible before more decisions are made about its applications.\n\n“Some of the decisions we’re making right now around development and deployment of these systems are potentially very high consequence,” Rush said. “If we’re going to do that, let’s not just take the obvious answer. Let’s make high-quality measurements.”\n\nEconomists have already asserted that METR’s research aligns with broader narratives on AI and productivity. While AI is beginning to chip away at entry-level positions, according to LinkedIn chief economic opportunity officer Aneesh Raman, it may offer diminishing returns for skilled workers such as experienced software developers.\n\n“For those people who have already had 20 years, or in this specific example, five years of experience, maybe it’s not their main task that we should look for and force them to start using these tools if they’re already well functioning in the job with their existing work methods,” Anders Humlum, an assistant professor of economics at the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business, told Fortune.\n\nHumlum has similarly conducted research on AI’s impact on productivity. He found in a working study from May that among 25,000 workers in 7,000 workplaces in Denmark—a country with similar AI uptake as the U.S.—productivity improved a modest 3% among employees using the tools.\n\nHumlum’s research supports MIT economist and Nobel laureate Daron Acemoglu’s assertion that markets have overestimated productivity gains from AI. Acemoglu argues only 4.6% of tasks within the U.S. economy will be made more efficient with AI.\n\n“In a rush to automate everything, even the processes that shouldn’t be automated, businesses will waste time and energy and will not get any of the productivity benefits that are promised,” Acemoglu previously wrote for Fortune. “The hard truth is that getting productivity gains from any technology requires organizational adjustment, a range of complementary investments, and improvements in worker skills, via training and on-the-job learning.”\n\nThe case of the software developers’ hampered productivity points to this need for critical thought on when AI tools are implemented, Humlum said. While previous research on AI productivity has looked at self-reported data or specific and contained tasks, data on challenges from skilled workers using the technology complicate the picture.\n\n“In the real world, many tasks are not as easy as just typing into ChatGPT,” Humlum said. “Many experts have a lot of experience [they’ve] accumulated that is highly beneficial, and we should not just ignore that and give up on that valuable expertise that has been accumulated.”\n\n“I would just take this as a good reminder to be very cautious about when to use these tools,” he added.\n\nA version of this story originally published on Fortune.com on July 20, 2025.",

    "fullText": "Almost 1,000 flights to and from the Caribbean were canceled on Saturday after the US raid on Venezuela.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration banned commercial aircraft from flying over Venezuelan airspace before expanding restrictions to much of the Caribbean.\n\nPuerto Rico was the most affected, with 400 flights canceled to or from the main airport in San Juan.\n\nThere were also over 140 cancellations in the US Virgin Islands, and 91 in Aruba, which is only about 20 miles off the Venezuelan coast.\n\nUsing data from FlightAware, Business Insider put together this map to show the scale of the disruption. You can hover over an icon to see the number of cancellations at the airport.\n\nAfter airspace restrictions ended early Sunday, airlines added dozens of extra flights to help passengers get where they needed to go.\n\nThe region is a particularly popular destination for vacationers seeking some winter sun over the New Year holiday.\n\nAmerican Airlines added 43 extra flights on Sunday and Monday, with room for 7,000 passengers.\n\nFor the first time in over a decade, it operated interisland flights in the eastern Caribbean on Monday. Namely, to Puerto Rico from Anguilla and the British Virgin Islands.\n\nAmerican's expanded schedule included deploying a Boeing 777-300, the largest model in its fleet, to ferry passengers between Miami and Puerto Rico.\n\nUnited Airlines listed 17 additional flights scheduled for Sunday and Monday, to and from its hubs in Houston, Newark, and Washington, DC.\n\nDelta Air Lines said that it has added space for 2,600 people on Monday. It didn't immediately provide details of the extra flights it has scheduled.\n\nA spokesperson for Southwest Airlines told Business Insider that it has added 21 round-trip flights to Aruba and Puerto Rico between Sunday and Wednesday.\n\nAirlines have waived change fees and fare differences for passengers flying to or from the Caribbean, to rebook for flights later in the month.\n\nHave you been affected by the travel disruption in the Caribbean?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Jaclyn Johnson, founder and chief creative officer at Create & Cultivate. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was raised by entrepreneurs, but I never wanted to be one. Instead, I saw myself in a big corner office in the city. I started climbing the corporate ladder, but being laid off twice showed me that a corporate career wasn't as secure as I thought.\n\nI started freelancing, and soon opened a marketing agency called No Subject. We focused on events and influencers, back when we were still calling them bloggers. I ran that company for four years and scaled it into a multimillion-dollar business. Those years were my MBA: I learned everything about how to run a business.\n\nNow that I was living in their world, I wanted to speak with other female founders and entrepreneurs. In 2011, I hosted a small retreat called Create & Cultivate for about 25 people in Palm Springs. It was a way to get offline and connect in person with like-minded women. I never in a million years thought it would be something bigger than that.\n\nAfter that first event, Create & Cultivate took on a life of its own. By 2014, I hosted 300 people in Los Angeles. Brands were knocking on my door to work with us — a big change from the marketing agency, where I was used to chasing brands.\n\nIn 2016, a colleague and mentor approached me. She thought that Create & Cultivate could become something much bigger if we really invested in it.\n\nI was really nervous to do that. I had started my other business with a laptop and an idea, so investing money was a new concept for me. My mom, however, encouraged me to invest in myself. She pointed out that I was used to paying for public relations and other professionals, so why wouldn't I use my money to back myself?\n\nI invested $50,000, which was nearly all my savings.\n\nFrom there, the business experienced exponential growth. I had a choice to make: I could stay with my marketing agency, which was a cushy and predictable job. Or, I could jump into Create & Cultivate — an option that was a riskier bet, but had huge potential.\n\nI decided to sell my marketing company. It gave me a financial cushion — enough to buy my first house.\n\nThat sale also introduced me to the idea that a company could be sold. As I continued to build Create & Cultivate, I was laser-focused on what made the company desirable: its focus on career women. Selling the company was my ultimate goal.\n\nThen, the pandemic happened, decimating the event space. Although we were able to pivot to digital fairly successfully, by the end of 2020, I was very burned out from the pandemic and the emotional roller coaster of the acquisitions process.\n\nIn March 2021, a private equity firm bought Create & Cultivate for $22 million. That was lower than the offers we'd had the year before, but it was a great deal considering the market. As the majority owner of the company, I received a substantial cash payment upon exit.\n\nI continued as CEO for a transition period, and then remained active on the board. After about 18 months, it became clear that the private equity firm was planning to sell the company.\n\nI was blindsided. As the founder, the business was so important to me. It was a community that I built and had a kinship with.\n\nStill, I wasn't thinking about personally buying it back until I spoke with Marina Middleton, who is now the CEO. She was immediately on board with purchasing back Create & Cultivate. We were able to purchase the company for six figures — not even close to the exit price.\n\nThis time, we're doing things differently. Because it's an existing company, I know we can't bootstrap. People need the quality they're accustomed to from the very beginning. As a result, we've raised $2.6 million in venture capital. We're focused on creating events that hinge on access to experts, leveraging tech components. It's related to my initial vision, but also completely different.\n\nI'm glad to be at the helm again.",

    "title": "My son had to do a family tree for a school project. I went on a genealogy deep dive to learn about a side of the family I never knew about.",
    "description": "After my son asked about our family history, I set out to uncover my father's lineage, piecing together a family tree once lost to silence.",
    "fullText": "I recall feeling embarrassed when my son asked me about my father's side of the family for a social studies project when he was in 6th grade. I didn't know much about my dad's side of the family, besides my dad's father's first name, Frank.\n\nIt felt wrong for my son to leave the column blank, and I also became curious. I suddenly wanted to learn more about my grandfather and father's side of the family.\n\nWhat made it complicated was that there was no one to ask.\n\nWhen my Dad died in a fire in his home at age 63, there was nothing salvageable but a handful of items in his car. Without him, the lineage of his side of the family felt erased.\n\nThe first time I saw my grandfather's face was in his obituary, a few years after my dad died. When I noticed the obituary did not include my dad's name, he reality of their estrangement hit. Although my dad had already died, I question what he would have thought if he saw his father's obituary, knowing his biological father did not recognize him at all. It made me sad, and I wondered if my father had remained a secret.\n\nBefore he died, my dad had told me his mother gave birth to him when she was 19. He didn't say much about his father besides mentioning a brief visit with him when he was around 5. I didn't have a lot to go on.\n\nTo find some answers and fill out at least part of the family tree for my dad's side of the family, I realized I'd have to fend for myself. I decided to use Ancestry.com to help fill in the gaps.\n\nFirst, I put my grandfather's name in Ancestry. I used his obituary as a starting point for his birth and death, his parents' names, and his brother's name, then I searched for census records, birth and marriage certificates, military records, and more. I began slowly gathering documents from his life that could help me build a family tree for my father's side of the family. Soon, his profile showed leaf icons, which the site uses as \"hints\" for me to explore.\n\nI started obsessing over clues about his life and upbringing. My search wasn't about reaching out to my relatives I don't know, it was purely for the creation of a family tree for my kids. I don't plan to surprise my relatives with an email of my findings, and wanting to one day meet. I do not plan to meet them. I'm fine being a part of the lineage that is in the shadows or perhaps a part of a hushed secret, but I still want the family's branches for my tree.\n\nOne day, when I logged into Ancestry.com, waiting for me was a portrait of my grandfather from his high school yearbook. It was like a gift. I studied his face, looking for any resemblance to my father; this was around the time he would meet my dad's mother. A couple of years later, my dad would be born.\n\nAnother gift I unearthed was my grandfather's selective service draft card from 1948. The word 'father' is checked off. I'm shocked to see this document from his life. It represents a moment in time when my grandfather and my father were together, even if only on this piece of paper, during the year my dad was born.\n\nI continued to do more research and discovered proof of a marriage and other children. Eventually, I discovered more relatives on my dad's side and discovered that many of them were named Frank or John.\n\nI've learned, my grandfather Frank was a man of science, a doctor who was passionate about brain health.\n\nMy great-grandfather Frank, born in 1886, was a chief clerk at the railroad in his 20s, later, he was an office manager for an ice cream factory. My great-great-grandfather, Frank, born in 1857, was a cigar manufacturer.\n\nI feel oddly connected to the story of these people, even though I didn't even know they existed before my search began.\n\nAfter two years of research, I can now better answer my son's questions about our family's past, and we're ready for the next school assignment that may come our way. I'm proud of myself for all I've discovered so far and the efforts I've made to build something meaningful from the shadows, and I think my father would be proud, too.",

    "description": "Two years ago, I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Though it comes with challenges, I won't let it stop me from doing what I love, including travel.",
    "fullText": "It was a bright, sunny day in Tepoztlán, Mexico, when my friends and I trekked to an ancient Aztec temple at the top of Tepozteco Mountain.\n\nBut by the time I made it to the summit, I was greeted with bad news: The ruins were closing in five minutes.\n\nI was too angry to appreciate the splendor around me; the valley spread out below me like a picture book.\n\nIn the photo my friend snapped, I'm frowning like a petulant teenager on the verge of a tantrum. It wasn't my finest moment, to say the least.\n\nTwo years before, that roughly 1.5-mile climb would've been a piece of cake for an experienced hiker like me. But that all changed when I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 39.\n\nType 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that causes the body to attack insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. With little or no insulin, the body can struggle to use glucose for energy.\n\nAfter my doctor gave me the news, I was forced to come to terms with a bewildering new reality: injecting insulin multiple times a day, obsessively monitoring my blood sugar, and calculating carb ratios before every meal.\n\nIf I didn't learn how to mimic the work of a human pancreas, there was a chance I could go blind, lose limbs, fall into a coma, or die.\n\nThe disease also came with constant exhaustion, alarming medical costs, and a crippling fear of exercise — I risk a sugar crash if I so much as walk my dog around the block with too much insulin in my system.\n\nI felt like I had been broken into a thousand pieces and had to rebuild my identity from the ground up. But I was determined to rediscover the parts of myself that type 1 diabetes had ripped away, particularly my love of travel and spontaneous adventure.\n\nSo, when my friends proposed a trip to Mexico last December, I jumped at the chance to take my first trip abroad since my diagnosis.\n\nAfter our first day in Mexico City, it became painfully clear that, even if I was on vacation, my disease wasn't.\n\nA simple afternoon of strolling through the city, visiting a museum, and eating unfamiliar snacks sent my glucose on a roller coaster of highs and lows. By the time we got back to our Airbnb, I was so exhausted that instead of staying up late to check out the local bars as I usually would, I collapsed into bed before sunset.\n\nThe day we headed to Tepozteco, I was determined to do a better job of managing my blood sugar. But even with plenty of carbs and protein in my system, my glucose started to plummet after only a few minutes, which meant I had to stop multiple times along the trail to rest and eat carb-heavy snacks.\n\nIt wasn't all bad, though. At a bend in the path, I came across a man selling paletas (fruit popsicles) from a cooler.\n\nAs I sat beside him and looked up at the canopy of trees, sweet strawberry melting in my mouth, I told myself that taking this moment to recharge didn't mean I was weak.\n\nBut when I stood on that temple in the fading afternoon light, I sure felt like I was.\n\nI have to laugh at that picture of me atop Tepozteco now. That grimacing woman, with hunched shoulders and tears of anger streaming under her sunglasses, wasn't able to appreciate that she'd accomplished something remarkable.\n\nIf I could talk to her, I'd tell her to quit beating herself up and take in the splendor around her. I'd tell her that, although her body can never be what it was before, even a chronic disease can't take away the love she has for the world.\n\nI've learned that you never fall into a rhythm with type 1 diabetes. There are dozens of factors that can affect your blood sugar on any given day, from stress to hot weather to hormones, which means your insulin needs are constantly changing.\n\nBut things have started to get a little better. A few months ago, I made the switch from injection pens to a pump, which has taken a lot of the guesswork out of managing my diabetes.\n\nI even put it to the test this June on a hike up Balsam Lake Mountain in the Catskills. And guess what? Thanks to a hearty breakfast, the miracles of medical technology, and a little patience, I didn't crash once.\n\nAt the summit, I took a selfie from the top of a century-old fire tower. It may not have been an ancient ruin 2,000 miles from home, but that isn't the point. What matters is that the woman in that photo is smiling.",

    "fullText": "Michael Burry says the US raid on Venezuela is a much bigger deal than the markets' muted reaction suggests.\n\nThe investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, who recently pivoted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack, published a post early Monday saying the \"game just changed\" in the mid to long term, and \"markets are not pricing in all that may come of this weekend's events.\"\n\n\"This is a paradigm shift despite the markets yawning,\" he later wrote on X.\n\nBenchmark oil prices climbed less than 1% on Monday, and US stock futures opened higher, after the US captured President Nicolás Maduro over the weekend and President Trump said America would \"run\" the oil-rich country for the time being.\n\nThe seizure was a \"shot across China's bow,\" Burry wrote, pointing to billions of dollars in loans that China has made to Venezuela under its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which were collateralized using future oil output that is \"now in US hands.\"\n\nThe investor, who shot to fame after his prescient bet against the mid-2000s housing bubble was featured in the book and movie \"The Big Short,\" wrote that China may now have a \"blueprint\" for how to take control of Taiwan, but \"must be in awe of Trumpian America's infuriating gall and decisive power.\"\n\nBurry said that China stocks strike him as \"somewhat riskier\" now in terms of running afoul of sanctions. He wrote that Alibaba, Baidu, and other potential sanction targets \"could be in for some volatility\" if China escalates its aggression in the South China Sea or targets Taiwan.\n\nThe contrarian bargain hunter also wrote that \"Putin's jaw has to be on the floor\" after the US did in \"practically seconds\" what Russia has been trying to do in Ukraine for three years.\n\nHe added that Russian oil \"just became less important\" in the mid to long term, as tapping Venezuelan oil could strengthen the US and \"reduce Russia's income and power.\"\n\nBurry also suggested that Canada and Mexico could \"lose a good amount of leverage\" in trade with the US if American refineries switch out Canadian crude for Venezuelan oil.\n\nThe veteran investor also said US oil-services companies such as Halliburton, Schlumberger, and Baker Hughes \"should benefit significantly\" as US contractors will be tasked with fixing and modernizing Venezuela's pipelines and refineries.\n\nBurry also forecast a \"long term tailwind\" for the US as inflows of Venezuelan oil will mean gas, diesel, and jet fuel prices will drop. He said that could push down prices to the benefit of consumers, especially lower-income ones, cut supply chain costs, and ease some uncertainty about the future for business owners.",

    "fullText": "Energy stocks soared Monday as investors wagered the US raid on Venezuela would pay off handsomely for the oil industry and related sectors.\n\nShares of both Halliburton and SLB — formerly Schlumberger — jumped more than 11% in morning trading, while Baker Hughes leaped 5%. Valero climbed 9%, Chevron gained 5%, and ConocoPhillips was up around 3% as of 12:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThose gains helped fuel a 1.5% rise in the Dow Jones, as well as 0.7% rises in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq.\n\nAsian and European stocks rose, with Germany's DAX closing up 1.3% and China's Shanghai Composite ending the day 2.2% higher. Among the biggest gainers were defense companies, including Germany's Rheinmetall, up 9.3%, and Britain's BAE Systems, up 5.5%.\n\nThe US captured Venezuela's president, Nicolás Maduro, in a military operation over the weekend. President Donald Trump has said that America will \"run\" the oil-rich country for the near future, and big US companies will come in to fix and update its dilapidated energy infrastructure.\n\nAs of 12:30 p.m. ET, gold had gained 2.9% to trade around $4,450, while silver rallied 8% to roughly $76.75. Copper, platinum, and palladium all rose by 5% or more.\n\nRuss Mould, AJ Bell's investment director, said in a morning note that investors were \"hedging their bets by increasing exposure to assets with supposed haven qualities.\"\n\nThe two main crude oil benchmarks, West Texas Intermediate and Brent, rose 1.7% and 1.6% respectively.\n\nSeveral analysts said that, assuming the US maintains control of Venezuela, it will take years to fix and upgrade its pipelines and refineries, so there probably won't be a material impact on global oil flows for a while.\n\nMould said that \"short-term, there is unlikely to be a flood of new supply due to sanctions, blockades and likely hesitation by oil majors over committing large amounts of money in a country undergoing geopolitical turbulence.\"\n\nAllen Good, Morningstar's director of equity research, said in a morning note that given the high costs and regulatory risks, the \"possibility of US companies developing Venezuela's oil reserves remains far from certain.\"\n\nOther close watchers predicted a broad economic boost in the years ahead.\n\nDaniel Casali, Evelyn Partners' chief investment strategist, said the US tapping Venezuelan oil could help it to \"lower inflation, boost real incomes, and support stronger consumption growth, providing a positive impulse to the global economy that should benefit stocks.\"\n\nMichael Burry, the investor of \"The Big Short\" fame, wrote in a Substack post on Monday that harnessing Venezuela's oil output could push down prices and supply chain costs in the US, and provide more certainty for businesses. He also said the raid had \"changed the game\" as it could bolster America's standing relative to China, Russia, Canada, and Mexico.",

    "fullText": "You spent the year committed to regular workouts and cutting back on ultra-processed foods. Then came the holidays: a time of sedentary indulgence.\n\n\"You're eating out of your comfort zone, and you're probably out of your fitness routine,\" Maddie Pasquariello, a registered dietitian in New York, told Business Insider. \"Those things combined make people spiral.\"\n\nPasquariello, who follows the 80/20 diet rule of eating mostly whole foods with occasional treats, said that as long as you've been consistent most of the year, a week or two of pure fun won't derail the long-term progress you've made. It doesn't make it any easier to avoid bad weight loss advice disguised as aspirational New Year's resolutions, though.\n\n\"My number one tip is actually to just get off social media,\" she said. \"I find that a lot of the reason people overthink their meals or go on crash diets is because they're following all of these different health influencers and wellness creators, and there's just a lot of noise.\"\n\nPasquariello shared a few of the most common diet trends she sees online every year — and which she stresses to avoid.\n\nIntermittent fasting is buzzy year-round among celebrities and tech CEOs. Whether by fasting 12 hours a day or eating all their meals in an eight-hour window, fans of intermittent fasting find time-restricted eating to be an easier way to restrict calories than counting them in a tracker.\n\nThis makes it particularly popular around this time of year, Pasquariello said, who always sees it \"promoted heavily around the holidays.\"\n\nWhile intermittent fasting can work for some people and has other benefits, like reducing acid reflux, others won't see much of a benefit. In fact, one of the pioneering researchers behind intermittent fasting quit the diet in 2020 after finding the evidence wasn't strong enough to say it works.\n\n\"Forgoing breakfast or lunch entirely will usually just make you that much hungrier later in the day, and potentially more likely to overeat,\" Pasquariello said.\n\nInstead of skipping breakfast, she recommended opting for a smaller, protein- and fiber-rich meal in the morning paired with movement such as a long walk, jog, strength training session, or HIIT workout. Gentle exercise, like walking, can help with digestion and blood sugar regulation without feeling famished.\n\n\"I find that it helps people avoid an 'all or nothing' approach, which can turn into a spiral of unhelpful thoughts and eating habits around the holidays,\" Pasquariello said.\n\nAt the height of shopping season, supplement and wellness companies are all making their biggest pitches, from \"healthy\" hot cocoa to weight-loss hacks.\n\n\"Beware of anyone telling you that there is a magical pill or supplement that can curb cravings, boost metabolism, or promote weight loss naturally,\" Pasquariello said. \"Nutrition science does not work like that, and 99.99% of these supplements are just a waste of your money.\"\n\nIf you're deficient in vitamins like magnesium or zinc, Pasquariello said supplements — with the approval of your doctor — can benefit your overall health. Correcting deficiencies can support overall metabolic health, which can indirectly boost energy levels and regulate appetite.\n\nBut it's potentially unsafe to take supplements without getting your bloodwork done and spotting actual deficiencies. Excess vitamins like iron or vitamin A can cause potentially serious health side effects.\n\nAround the holidays, it's more common for people to eat more dairy and acidic foods, including alcohol. Diets like the alkaline diet, which claims that eating alkaline foods like fruits and vegetables can alter your body's pH and help promote weight loss.\n\nIt's all pseudoscience, Pasquariello said: \"Your body regulates pH on its own. Anyone promoting that they can change their pH through a supplement, hydration pouch, or diet does not know what they're talking about.\"\n\nShe said some people feel better on alkaline diets — which encourage limiting or even cutting acidic foods like meat, fish, eggs, dairy, grains, and alcohol — either because they reduce how many ultra-processed foods they eat, or have a gluten or dairy sensitivity.\n\nHowever, a super-restrictive diet like this means you miss out on other beneficial nutrients, like omega-3s found in salmon. Cutting out protein-rich foods like meat, fish, and eggs can also make it harder to lose weight, as protein is filling and crucial for muscle growth.\n\nFor those eager to cut back on sweet treats and booze, the Mediterranean diet — focused on lean proteins and whole foods — is actually grounded in research. It's also a lot less miserable.",

    "description": "Every state has a capitol that houses its state legislature. Many are domed buildings similar to the US Capitol, but others are more unique.",
    "fullText": "A state's capitol can tell you a lot about its history and government.\n\nMany state capitols feature references to their locations, like Kansas' statue of a Kansa warrior atop its dome, or the New Hampshire State House, which was built with locally sourced granite.\n\nEvery capitol has a unique look and distinct origin, and you can learn more about them here.\n\nAlabama's capitol is where the Confederacy began, and there's a brass star on one of the porticos marking the spot where Jefferson Davis was sworn in as its president, according to the Alabama Historical Commission.\n\nThe building that stands today was constructed in 1851, after a fire burned down the original building in 1849, according to the Alabama Historical Commission.\n\nOne of the more famous parts of the capitol grounds is the Avenue of Flags. It has the flag of every state plus a native rock from each state at each flag's base. It was dedicated in 1968, according to Exploring Montgomery.\n\nThe Alaska State Capitol, completed in 1931, doesn't look much different from any other office building in Juneau, save the marble columns. According to Alaska's official website, it is one of few state capitols to not feature a dome.\n\nAs The New York Times reported in 1981, neither the building nor the location were popular with locals — both were chosen because the residents of Alaska had to fund construction themselves — but efforts to move the capitol have failed, even though a vote passed to move the location in the '70s.\n\nAs recently as 2022, Alaskan senators sponsored a bill to move the capital, this time to Willow, reported Alaska Public Media, but for now, Juneau remains the Last Frontier's capital city.\n\nArizona's capitol was dedicated in 1901. It stopped being the home of the legislative branches of government in 1960 — and by 1978, all government officials had been moved to other buildings nearby in an area called the Capitol Complex.\n\nThe original building was then officially converted into a museum that anyone can visit.\n\nArkansas' capitol took 16 years to complete. Construction lasted from 1899 to 1915, and the building was designed by architects George R. Mann and Cass Gilbert, according to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas.\n\nThis building replaced the State House, which is now the Old State House Museum, according to Arkansas Heritage.\n\nThe building was constructed between 1860 and 1874, and designed by Reuben S. Clark. It has been listed as a California Historical Landmark since 1974, according to the Historic State Capitol Commission.\n\nIts design was based on the US Capitol in Washington, DC, among other well-known American buildings, according to the State of California Capitol Museum.\n\nThe California State Capitol is located inside the 40-acre Capitol Park, which contains trees from around the world, a World Peace Rose Garden, and the Civil War Memorial Grove.\n\nThe Colorado Capitol, which was completed in 1901, was also designed to look like the US Capitol, but with a Colorado twist: The dome is covered in real gold leaf donated by gold miners to reference the Colorado Gold Rush from 1858 to 1861, according to the Colorado General Assembly.\n\nThe current Connecticut State Capitol is actually the third capitol the state has had since the American Revolution. This one, designed by Richard M. Upjohn, opened in 1879, according to Connecticut's official state website.\n\nThe golden dome is surrounded by six pairs of statues representing agriculture, commerce, education and law, force and war, science and justice, and music, according to the State Capitol Preservation & Restoration Commission.\n\nThe Delaware Legislative Hall was dedicated in 1933 and replaced the Old State House, which is opposite the Hall on the capitol mall. It was designed in the Colonial Revival style by E. William Martin, according to Delaware's official state website.\n\nThe United States Capitol is located on Capitol Hill in DC. It was in construction for decades, partially destroyed in 1814, and then finally finished in 1829, according to Architect of the Capitol. The famous, gigantic dome was later added during an expansive addition in 1855, designed by Thomas U. Walter.\n\nAtop the dome sits the \"Statue of Freedom,\" a 19-foot statue of a woman wearing a battle helmet, holding a sheathed sword in one hand, and a laurel wreath and shield in the other. She's been there since 1863, according to Architect of the Capitol.\n\nThe current capitol, also called the New Capitol, is located directly in front of the original — together, they form the Capitol Complex. The New Capitol was built in 1977 by architect Edward Durell Stone and the firm of Reynolds, Smith, and Hills, according to the Florida Capitol website.\n\nThe website reports the building was designed in an \"international style to reflect a modern Florida,\" and includes a 22-story central tower.\n\nThe Old Capitol still stands, and it was restored to its original 1902 glory in the '80s. Currently, the building is the Florida Historic Capitol Museum.\n\nGeorgia's capitol was finished in 1889 and designed by Willoughby J. Edbrooke and Franklin P. Burnham, according to the city of Atlanta's website. It sits on the site of the former Atlanta City Hall/Fulton County Courthouse, which was there from 1854 to 1994.\n\nAccording to the city, it's one of 43 National Historic Landmarks in the state.\n\nAt the dedication of the Hawaiian capitol in 1969, then-Governor John A. Burns explained the design of the building, the Honolulu Star Advertiser reported.\n\n\"In this great State Capitol there are no doors at the grand entrances which open toward the mountains and toward the sea,\" he said. \"There is no roof or dome to separate its vast inner court from the heavens and from the same eternal stars which guided the first voyagers to the primeval beauty of these shores.\"\n\nThe building is also surrounded by a reflecting pool meant to symbolize the Pacific Ocean, which surrounds the chain of 137 recognized islands that make up Hawaii, according to the State of Hawaii.\n\nIdaho's capitol was designed by architects J.E. Tourtellotte and Charles Hummel, and was constructed between 1905 and 1920. According to Idaho's Capitol Commission, it's the only capitol in the US that is heated by geothermal water. It comes from a spring 3,000 feet underground.\n\nAccording to a pamphlet by the Illinois Secretary of State's office, the current capitol (the state's sixth) was completed in 1888, 20 years after crews broke ground. At the time of its construction, the limestone dome was illuminated by 144 gas jets. However, the carbon emitted by those jets eventually turned the dome black.\n\nIt took 100 years, but it was finally cleaned in 1986.\n\nAccording to the Indiana Department of Administration, Indiana's capitol was completed in 1888, and is home to all executive offices, the Indiana State Senate, the Indiana House of Representatives, and the Indiana State Supreme Court, among others. It was constructed with Indiana limestone.\n\nThe large golden dome is 23 carats, and the entire building is 275 feet tall, according to a visitor's guide. It's been re-gilded four times since its construction in 1886.\n\nOverall, Iowa's capitol has a total of five domes, making it the only capitol in the US with five.\n\nKansas' capitol dome is topped with a statue called \"Ad astra\" (Latin for \"to the stars\"), which is part of the state's motto, \"ad astra per aspera\" (\"to the stars through difficulties\"), according to the Kansas Historical Society.\n\nThe statue itself is a bronze depiction of a warrior from the Kansa tribe (also known as the Kaw Nation or Kanza), who call Kansas home and gave the state its name.\n\nThe entire building took 37 years to construct, also according to the Kansas Historical Society, from 1866 to 1903.\n\nKentucky's capitol was designed by Frank Mills Andrews, according to Kentucky's official state website. There are also statues lining the front portico that represent Kentucky, the central figure, with Progress, History, Plenty, Law, Art, and Labor as her \"attendants,\" according to the state website.\n\nThe current building is the fourth capitol in the state, and it was completed in 1910.\n\nThe Louisiana Capitol is just one of nine capitols in the US that doesn't feature a dome — and at 450 feet tall (or 34 floors), it's also the tallest capitol in the country, according to Louisiana's House of Representatives.\n\nIt was dedicated in 1932, without the person who had spearheaded the effort to build it, Senator Huey P. Long, a controversial figure in Louisiana's history, as reported by Encyclopedia Britannica.\n\nThe capital of Maine was originally Portland when the state broke away from Massachusetts in 1820. But when Mainers asked for a more centrally located capital city, Augusta was chosen in 1827, according to the Maine State Legislature. The building was completed by 1832.\n\nThe State House's dome is topped with a female figure of Wisdom, which was designed by sculptor W. Clark Noble of Gardiner, a town 6 miles from Augusta.\n\nMaryland's State House is the oldest capitol in continuous legislative use in the US, built in 1779, according to its official website. It's also the only state capitol to have once served as the US capitol when the Continental Congress met there from 1783 to 1784, according to the website.\n\nThe Massachusetts State House, built in 1789, originally had a wooden dome, but Paul Revere's own company was responsible for covering it in copper in 1802, CBS News reported.\n\nAnd the land it was built on? It used to be owned by none other than John Hancock, who was Massachusetts' first elected governor.\n\nThe floors of Michigan's capitol, which was dedicated in 1879, are made of limestone and have visible fossils in them, as you can see on the capitol's official website.\n\nAccording to Explore Minnesota, the state's capitol is the second-largest self-supporting marble dome in the world, only behind St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.\n\nArchitect Cass Gilbert insisted on using Georgia marble for the dome, according to the Minnesota Historical Society. Some were critical of using out-of-state materials, so as a compromise, the contractor leased the quarry in Georgia and imported the rough marble so Minnesotans could do the work in-state.\n\nIt took nine years, but was completed in 1905.\n\nDesigned by architect Theodore Link and constructed between 1901 and 1903, Mississippi's state capitol was built on the site of an old state penitentiary, according to the state capitol's official website. The building spans 171,000 square feet and features 4,750 original electric light fixtures, as well as an 8-foot statue of an eagle on the top of its dome.\n\nMissouri's state capitol was completed in 1917, according to its official website. Ceres, the goddess of grain, sits at the top of its dome.\n\nIn addition to Missouri's state legislature, the 500,000-square-foot building houses the Missouri State Museum with exhibits about the state's history and natural resources.\n\nThe main building of Montana's state capitol was completed in 1902, and its two wings were added in 1911 and 1912, according to the Montana Historical Society. Inside, the building features works of art such as the mural \"Lewis and Clark Meeting Indians at Ross' Hole,\" painted by Charles M. Russell in 1912.\n\nNebraska's state capitol was designed by architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue and completed in 1932, according to its official website. The 400-foot tower is topped with a 19-foot bronze statue called \"The Sower.\"\n\nIt is the only state legislature to be unicameral, meaning it only has one chamber.\n\nNevada's state capitol was built from 1870 to 1871 out of sandstone sourced from a quarry belonging to Abe Curry, the founder of Carson City, according to Travel Nevada. It features a silver-colored dome, a nod to Nevada's nickname as \"the silver state.\"\n\nThe New Hampshire State House was constructed between 1816 and 1819 with locally sourced granite from Rattlesnake Hill in Concord, according to the New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources.\n\nIn 1818, a wooden sculpture of an eagle painted with gold was installed on top of the capitol dome. It was replaced with a copper replica in 1957, but the original sculpture can be viewed on display inside the capitol, according to EverGreene, the architecture firm that restored the State House's gold-plated dome.\n\nAfter Maryland, New Jersey State House is the second-oldest capitol still in use, completed in 1792, according to the state of New Jersey's official website. Much of the original building, designed by architect Jonathan Doane, was destroyed in a fire in 1885.\n\nArchitect Lewis Broome restored the capitol and added a cast-iron dome plated with copper and gold and featuring the Latin phrase \"Fiat Justitia Ruat Coelum,\" meaning  \"There must be justice even though the heavens fall.\"\n\nNew Mexico's capitol, known as the Roundhouse, is the only round capitol in the US, according to Santa Fe's official tourist website. Architect Willard C. Kruger modeled the design after the Zia sun symbol, which he also incorporated into the capitol rotunda skylight. The symbol is also part of New Mexico's state flag.\n\nWhen New York's state capitol in Albany was finally finished after 32 years in 1899, it was at a cost of $25 million, making it one of the most expensive government projects in the US. In 2013, The New York Times reported the figure was equivalent to more than half a billion dollars today.\n\nInside the granite building, visitors can find 25 murals by William deLeftwich Dodge in the Governor's Reception Room.\n\nCompleted in 1840, North Carolina's 3-story capitol includes a copper dome, according to the National Park Service.\n\nNorth Dakota's state capitol is the tallest building in the state at 241 feet and 8 inches tall, according to the official government website. The Art-Deco structure is nicknamed the \"Skyscraper on the Prairie,\" according to the Society of Architecture Historians.\n\nConstruction of the Ohio Statehouse took over 20 years, from 1839 to 1861, according to its official website. Much of the work was done by prisoners at Ohio Penitentiary, some of whom left graffiti on the walls that was uncovered during restoration work, the website says. Built in the Greek-Revival architecture style out of Columbus limestone, the Statehouse is a designated National Historic Landmark.\n\nBuilt in 1917, the dome on Oklahoma's capitol was added more recently, in 2002, according to the Oklahoma Historical Society — it was left out of the original construction due to costs. The grounds of Oklahoma's capitol also had active oil rigs until 1986. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.\n\nOregon's Art Deco capitol is made of white Vermont marble with a gold statue of an \"Oregon Pioneer\" atop the dome, according to the capitol's official website. In-person guided tours are paused due to construction.\n\nPennsylvania's capitol, designed by architect Joseph Huston, cost $13 million to build when it was completed in 1906, which would be over $403 million today, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThe building's 272-foot dome is decorated with green glazed terra cotta tile, according to the capitol's official website.\n\nThe Rhode Island State House, built between 1895 and 1904, features the fourth-largest freestanding marble dome in the world, according to the Rhode Island Restoration Committee's official website. It has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places since 1970.\n\nThe construction of the South Carolina State House began in 1854, but halted due to the Civil War. The building still features cannonball marks from when the Union army captured Columbia in 1865, according to Discover South Carolina. The State House was finally completed in 1903, and it was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1976, according to the South Carolina Department of Archives and History.\n\nA portrait of state senator Clementa Pinckney, who was killed in the 2015 shooting at Charleston's Mother Emanuel AME Church, hangs in the Senate Gallery.\n\nSouth Dakota's state capitol was constructed between 1905 and 1910, not long after South Dakota became a US state in 1889, according to the South Dakota Bureau of Administration. An annex was added in 1932. The Neoclassical building features scagliola plaster columns, war memorials, and stained-glass windows, according to Travel South Dakota.\n\nThe Tennessee State Capitol opened in 1859. The architect, William Strickland, died during its construction in 1854 and was buried on the capitol grounds along with President James K. Polk and first lady Sarah Childress Polk, according to the Tennessee State Museum.\n\nCompleted in 1888, the Texas State Capitol dome is topped with a statue of Libertas, the goddess of liberty, according to the official website for the Texas House of Representatives.

    "title": "I visited Grocery Outlet. It was weird, but I saw why it's a go-to supermarket for some shoppers.",
    "description": "Grocery Outlet is opening stores around the US. I visited a location in Maryland and thought the chain's off-price grocery model was novel.",
    "fullText": "One grocery chain is expanding using a business model that's somewhere between Aldi and T.J. Maxx.\n\nSupermarket chain Grocery Outlet promises low prices, and it has a novel approach: Like Aldi's locations, Grocery Outlet stores tend to be smaller than traditional grocery stores and emphasize low prices.\n\nBut like T.J. Maxx, Grocery Outlet often sells products that other retailers or food manufacturers can't move themselves.\n\nDuring the height of the pandemic in 2020, for instance, Grocery Outlet bought 30,000 cases of 1-gallon containers of salsa that were meant for restaurants, former CEO Robert Sheedy said on an earnings call at the time.\n\n\"Grocery Outlet buyers are experts at purchasing that product opportunistically,\" the chief marketing officer, Layla Kasha, said in a statement to Business Insider in September.\n\nThat means finding products \"outside of the normal retail channel as a result of packaging changes, product overruns, and other varied inventory circumstances,\" she said. \"Our suppliers offer us great prices on that surplus inventory, and we pass those savings along to our customers.\"\n\nThis approach allows Grocery Outlet to sell products for 40% to 70% less than comparable items at traditional retailers, according to the company's latest annual report.\n\nGrocery Outlet had 563 stores as of its third quarter, which ended on September 27. The chain said in November that it planned to end 2025 with 37 new store openings for the year.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company already has a significant presence in the Western US, but it's expanding in Eastern states, including Delaware, Maryland, and Pennsylvania.\n\nI wanted to experience shopping at Grocery Outlet for myself, so I visited one of the chain's relatively new stores in September. Here's what I found.\n\nDo you have a story idea to share about Grocery Outlet or another retailer? Contact this reporter at abitter@businessinsider.com.\n\nLocated in a shopping mall in Beltsville, Maryland, this store opened in July 2024.\n\nThis sign outside the main entrance highlighted some of Grocery Outlet's deals, including salted caramel cookies, cheese balls, and ribeye steaks.\n\nThough Grocery Outlet says it's \"opportunistic\" with its buying, the chain's stores stock many of the same types of products that you'll find at traditional grocery stores, such as produce. This sign reminded me of that as I walked in.\n\nGrocery Outlet stores generally take up between 15,000 and 20,00 square feet, according to the company's latest annual filing. Aldi stores, by comparison, are generally about 22,000 square feet.\n\nBoth grocery chains are much smaller than the format used by traditional supermarkets, which can take up twice as much space at about 40,000 square feet.\n\nAs I walked through the front of the store, I found ceramic pots, gardening tools, and this selection of potted plants.\n\nGrocery Outlet often touts that many of its products are name brands. That was true with these boxes of canned La Croix seltzer.\n\nI've written about and followed many food and beverage brands over the years, but I wasn't familiar with Good Sport, a dairy-based sports drink.\n\nGrocery Outlet makes some of its own products under the SimplyGo name, such as these tortilla chips.\n\nThe chain tries to stock store-branded goods and those from name brands \"as evenly as possible,\" Kasha told Business Insider.\n\nMost of Grocery Outlet's private-label items are \"everyday grocery basics\" such as butter, eggs, and paper towels, she said. \"We source those traditionally to ensure our shoppers can find them each time they come to the store,\" she said.\n\nMany of the name-brand goods, meanwhile, are meant to create a \"treasure hunt shopping experience,\" Kasha said. Think about \"a holiday-themed cereal, or a fun soda flavor that you've never heard of,\" she said.\n\nThese Hooters-branded crab cakes piqued my interest, given my reporting on the chain's bankruptcy earlier this year.\n\nI bought a box and tried them at home. They were unremarkable.\n\nIn the back of the store, I found the produce section, which had many of the basic types of fruit and vegetables that other stores have, from eggplants to lemons.\n\nI bought some red, seedless grapes and was happy with the quality.\n\nThese grapes were $1.99 a pound at Grocery Outlet. The tag said that they'd cost $3.99 a pound \"elsewhere,\" which seems plausible to me, though I had no clue which other stores they were talking about.\n\nBesides jars of salsa and tortillas, there was a range of spices often used in Mexican cooking. I picked up some dried chiles for my next homemade salsa rosa.\n\nI'd never seen sausages flavored with Old Bay, which I wanted to try but opted not to because I had a long drive home.\n\nThis frozen personal DiGiorno \"breakfast croissant\" was $2.49, so I picked one up.\n\nThe breakfast croissant was good, though I probably won't be rushing back for more.\n\nI almost bought the last bottle of juice squeezed from noni, a fruit native to Southeast Asia and common in parts of the Pacific such as Hawaii.\n\nCurious, I did a quick Google search and found that this same bottle was selling for more than $40 online, as the price tag said.\n\nMany of the products that Grocery Outlet sold at the location I visited were a little outside what you'd expect in a normal grocery store.\n\nOreo truffle mix? A breakfast croissant with cheese and ham? It felt like I had asked the beta version of an AI model to generate pictures of normal groceries.\n\nThese cans of diced tomatoes were from a brand I've never heard of — California Healthy Harvest. At $0.50 each, I bought two, since I hadn't seen canned tomatoes so cheap elsewhere in the DC area where I live.\n\nGiven Grocery Outlet's model, I was curious to see what kinds of groceries ended up in the clearance section.\n\nThe answer: huge tins of soda crackers for $1.17 each and 6-pound cans of salsa verde for $2.57 each.\n\nThere was a selection of candy-themed blankets, such as this orange Reese's throw.\n\nJim Read started what would become Grocery Outlet in 1946 by selling surplus military supplies, according to the company.\n\nThese packs of Peeps came individually wrapped to make them easier to hide in Easter eggs.\n\nIt's a great idea, but given that I was shopping at Grocery Outlet in September, I could see why they were so heavily discounted.\n\nGrocery Outlet continues to open new stores, including another location in Pennsylvania in August.\n\nIf the chain continues to expand — especially on the East Coast — I bet I'll be back at some point.",

    "description": "The souls-like genre has exploded in popularity since the dawn of From Software's Souls franchise, with multiple companies taking a stab at the format--and some companies taking multiple stabs. Bandai Namco, who publishes FromSoft's Souls games as well as Elden Ring, dropped an anime-style version of the genre in 2019's Code Vein, and now it's back for more in Code Vein II.\nWe spent a few hours with the next Code Vein adventure during The Game Awards week, and we came away impressed with its improved combat system and a new and interesting take on the genre's \"summon\" mechanic, but what surprised us most was an original story that carries some emotional weight. The original Code Vein was a solid first effort, but Code Vein II shows that the franchise may have, pardon the pun, cracked the code.\nCode Vein II\nA new code\nCode Vein II takes place in a world on the edge of ruin, and where humans and Revenants, a human-like species of beings with vampiric abilities, live amongst one another.",

    "description": "I visited the US and Canadian sides of Niagara Falls. There were lots of things to do on both sides, but I loved the Cave of the Winds experience.",
    "fullText": "When researching a trip to Niagara Falls, you'll notice there's a fairly heated debate about whether the Canadian or American side is better. But during a trip to both sides in June, I found that each had its own advantages.\n\nMy husband and I researched the many experiences and attractions available in the area and chose to try out the most-loved ones. Here's what I'd recommend doing around Niagara Falls.\n\nSpoiler: most of them involve a poncho.\n\nWhen you go to Niagara Falls, one of the quintessential things to do is a boat ride that takes you up close to the Falls.\n\nAlthough we used the Canadian company, Niagara City Cruises, you can do a similar experience called Maid of the Mist from the US side.\n\nThey're both about 20-minute boat rides, and the only difference I could see was that the Canadian tour had red ponchos while the American one supplied blue ones.\n\nWhat starts as a slow, scenic ride quickly turns into a frenzy of water and wind as you approach Horseshoe Falls. It's chaotic, a ton of fun, and you'll walk away with soaking wet shoes if you choose to stand on the upper deck.\n\nOnce on the Canadian side, we were treated to breathtaking views of all three waterfalls: American Falls, Bridal Veil Falls, and the iconic Horseshoe Falls.\n\nAlthough two of the Falls are on the American side, observing from the Canadian side gave us a better view of all three.\n\nI especially loved the Fallsview area, where you can stroll on a paved path along the cliff's edge that's flanked by a stone barrier on one side and curated grass lawns with statues, trees, and benches on the other.\n\nAcross the board, the Canadian side of Niagara Falls feels more urbanized. It has all kinds of restaurants, shops, and attractions close to the Falls, whereas I thought the New York side felt a little dated and lacking in options.\n\nThat said, the Canadian side, especially the Clifton Hill area, can feel a little too commercialized and borderline gimmicky with its chain restaurants and carnival-style signs that light up and spin .\n\nIf you have your passport with you, I highly recommend visiting both the American and Canadian sides of Niagara Falls, which are only separated by a quarter-mile-long structure known as the Rainbow Bridge.\n\nAlthough you can drive across the bridge, I recommend walking. Not only was it exciting to go through the turnstile that said \"entry to Canada,\" but it was also a great vantage point to see the Falls.\n\nIt only costs $1 to cross on foot, and we waited a total of five minutes at customs. The long line of cars waiting to pass through customs, on the other hand, barely seemed to move as we walked by.\n\nAlthough Canada has the Fallsview area, the US has Niagara Falls State Park.\n\nThe park perches you at the top of the Falls, giving an incredibly unique perspective as you look down onto the cascading water. Here, you can really appreciate the sheer volume of water going over the three Falls: a combined 3,160 tons of water every second.\n\nIn the park, you can access overlooks to peer down each of the three waterfalls.\n\nOn the Canadian side, we found everyone was squeezed into a relatively narrow strip along the Fallsview Trail. Niagara Falls State Park, however, encompasses over 400 acres of land, which means the crowd naturally fanned out.\n\nMy husband and I were even able to have a picnic under a tree, and there wasn't a soul around.\n\nThe waterfall overlooks were spread out from one another as well. Fewer people seemed to be making the walk to visit them, so they didn't feel as congested as some of the vantage points on the Canadian side.\n\nWhile standing above the Falls is stunning and riding a boat close to them is fun, I wanted to get as close I safely could. Essentially, I wanted to stand under the Falls. And that's what Cave of the Winds, situated in Niagara Falls State Park, offers.\n\nOur experience kicked off by riding an elevator down 17 stories. At the bottom, we were given a poncho and told that we could explore as long as we wanted.\n\nIn front of us was a network of wooden boardwalks and decks that was built directly next to the bottom of Bridal Veil Falls. Walking around, it was difficult to even have a conversation above the roar of the water.\n\nI was also shocked to discover that I had a hard time standing upright. The hurricane-level gusts and deluge of water coming from above were more powerful than I ever could've imagined.\n\nAt the end of the day, each side of Niagara Falls has extraordinary gems. And since they're so close to each other, I suggest seeking out the best of both worlds rather than sticking to one side.",

    "fullText": "Online music and blogging were two key trends in the first decade of digital culture. In 2003, they combine in the form of MP3 blogs. Together with Pitchfork, they revolutionize music journalism.\n\nPitchfork's 2003 review of MP3 blogger favorite, The Rapture.\n\nSeason 4 of Cybercultural has been focused on the rise of digital culture from 1994 through to 2003, a period that encompasses the beginning of the web, moves through the dot-com boom and bust, and ends the year before Web 2.0 emerges. During this season, I've written a lot about how both online music and blogging evolved from 1994-2003 — helping to push the internet into mainstream culture. It's appropriate, then, that the final post of this season looks at a sub-trend that combines these two topics: music blogs, a.k.a. \"MP3 blogs.\"\n\nOne such music fan was Matthew Perpetua, a recent art school graduate from Brooklyn, who had been running his site Fluxblog since early 2002. He’d started out on Blogger (newflux.blogspot.com) with the intention of moving to a different host, but had stuck with the now Google-owned service. Perpetua posted mostly about music — his goal from the start had been to publish “special links, commentary, music recommendations, petty gossip.”\n\n\"But I Was There!\"; Fluxblog, June 2003.\n\nThe “special links” were MP3 files, and they were not strictly legal. It was kind of like a blog version of Napster, only Perpetua was hosting the MP3 links himself — temporarily. At the top of the blog was this message: “Please Note That MP3s Are Only Offered For A Limited Time And Are Changed Frequently.”\n\nThe format was fairly simple: every day (or second day), post one or two MP3 files along with a sentence or two of commentary. In a lot of cases, the MP3 files were by relatively unknown indie artists — on May 23, 2003, for instance, Perpetua posted three songs by Kazmi with Rickies, The Sounds, and The Exploding Hearts. But he’d also post bootlegs from well-known artists. On May 28, he posted a bootleg from a 1985 Prince concert, as well as a 1980 single from Alice Cooper called “Clones (We're All).”\n\n\"We invaded Sonia's place and ripped tons of music. Lots of computers involved.\" A February 2003 photo of MP3 ripping, by Ram K on Flickr.\n\nIn addition to the MP3 postings, there were irregular concert reviews and even a review of the movie The Matrix Reloaded — which Perpetua panned. But music was his mainstay and on June 6, 2003, he wrote about a concert he’d been to in Brooklyn. The lead act was a popular local band called The Rapture (months later, Pitchfork would place them at number one in its 2003 best albums list). But Perpetua was more interested in the opening act, LCD Soundsystem, who were largely unknown at the time; they’d only formed the previous year and so far had released just two singles. Perpetua was even able to approach the band after the show.\n\n“I spoke to LCD Soundsystem's leader/singer James Murphy (who looks like a cross between Pete & Pete's Endless Mike and Six Feet Under's Nate Fisher) when they were packing up, and he told me that they were planning on releasing two more singles in 2003, and that their album would be out in 2004. I'm very excited to hear more.”\n\nAt this point, few people would’ve read that over-excited review of a nascent Brooklyn band on an obscure Blogspot site. Fluxblog was “a blog written with the intended audience of people I knew from message boards,” Perpetua later said in an interview. And it stayed that way for much of 2003, until he had a breakthrough when he posted LCD Soundsystem’s third single, “Yeah,” about a month before its official release.\n\nLCD Soundsystem band photo from 2003; via Wayback Machine.\n\nOn December 12, 2003, Perpetua put an MP3 file of “Yeah (Stupid Version)” onto Fluxblog. “Going on all of the stray unreleased LCD Soundsystem songs circulating online right now and the amazing opening set that I saw them play at Irving Plaza in support of The Rapture earlier in the year, it seems as though they are preparing to drop one hell of a debut album,” he gushed.\n\nPerpetua also pointed to a bulletin board where he’d started a discussion about the song, which had received a lot of comments. He admitted that he didn’t know the origin of the MP3 file:\n\n“I have no idea whether it's been released yet — on soulseek [a file sharing network], it's part of some record, but I think it's just a promo. I'm trying to figure this out. A DJ friend of mine from England sent me a message last night telling me to download it because he couldn't stop playing it, and that's about as much as I know.”\n\nThe following day on Fluxblog, Perpetua writes that “there's been a major spike in traffic since I posted the LCD Soundsystem song — this blog had over 1000 hits yesterday, and it looks like it should be just a little bit shy of the same number today.”\n\nHe urges the “400-500+ extra people” to stick around — “I post cool stuff here all the time.”\n\nI Love Music bulletin board, December 2003.\n\nAccording to a later Time Out magazine profile, some of those new readers were “A&R types,” DJs and music magazine editors, who began monitoring Fluxblog to look for trends and upcoming talent. These days, we’d say that Fluxblog attracted the attention of industry influencers, and by doing that it soon became an influencer itself.\n\nSo that late-2003 post of the LCD Soundsystem song turned out to be a tipping point, causing Fluxblog to become a key member of the nascent music blogosphere. Perpetua later said it “changed the course of my life.”\n\nAnother early MP3 blog to become successful was Stereogum, which started out on LiveJournal in 2002 and migrated to its own domain on Movable Type in 2003.\n\nAs an aside: I’d had my own blogging breakthrough earlier in 2003, with a July post on Read/WriteWeb entitled “Weblogs should be topic-first, not author-first.” I was riffing on something Clay Shirky, a published author and early blog influencer, had said. Shirky himself linked back to my post, along with a bunch of other tech bloggers. In its own small way, that was my everything has changed moment. Now I wasn’t writing to the void, wondering if anyone was out there. Suddenly, my blog had readers! I'm sure Perpetua felt something similar.\n\nOf course, it’s not a trend until someone coins a name for it. The term “MP3 blog” arose sometime during 2004. In a May 2004 article in Vue Weekly, an arts and entertainment weekly magazine from Edmonton, Perpetua was called the “forefather of MP3 blogs.” By July of that year, he’d been mentioned in a USA Today article, which stated that MP3 blogs were “part online mixtape, part diary, and part music magazine.”\n\nLike The Rolling Stones, Fluxblog has longevity: the site is still active as at December 2025. But still the MP3 files are \"only offered for a limited time.\"\n\nSo how did MP3 blogs fit into an online music scene that was increasingly being defined by Pitchfork, an online magazine founded in 1996 by Ryan Schreiber (who, like Perpetua, lived in Brooklyn). Pitchfork had also noticed LCD Soundsystem during 2003 — in February, LCD Soundsystem's debut single \"Losing My Edge\" was mentioned as a comparison point in a review of another artist. There were a couple of other off-hand mentions through the year, but LCD Soundsystem didn't become a Pitchfork fixture until its debut album was released in January 2005 (it was given an 8.2 out of 10 rating the following month).\n\nSo Fluxblog and other MP3 blogs really were at the cutting edge of identifying new music trends, while Pitchfork was more the 'fast follower' that pushed artists like LCD Soundsystem to a wider audience of global hipsters.\n\nThe Pitchfork story is itself illustrative of how the internet changed music journalism. One of Schreiber's goals was to dethrone the older artists that baby boomer publications like Rolling Stone still venerated — artists like David Bowie and The Rolling Stones. In an oral history published by Slate in 2024, Schreiber (then in middle age himself) reflected on his attitude in 1999: “I was definitely looking at this new decade ahead and going, Man, we’re going to need a whole new canon. And I felt like that was on Pitchfork’s shoulders.”\n\nPitchfork reviews Bowie's latest album in September 2003 (interestingly, there's an advert featuring LCD Soundsystem and The Rapture to the right); via Wayback Machine.\n\nIn its “best of” list at the end of 2003, Pitchfork declared that it “was the first year that felt like a fully formed part of the 00’s.” 2003 didn’t belong to established artists, the article contended, but “an entirely new crop of songwriters and artists burrowed out the woodwork, laying the foundation for the decade as it will be remembered when we leave it six years from now.” Radiohead’s latest album finished fourth on this top-50 list, so by “established” Pitchfork clearly meant boomer artists like Bowie, whose 2003 album didn't make the cut.\n\nNumber one on Pitchfork’s end-of-year list? The debut album by the now forgotten Brooklyn-based band, The Rapture. Even at the time, this band was barely known outside of MP3 bloggers and Pitchfork’s readers. Needless to say, The Rapture did not end up laying the foundation for the future of music.\n\nIn 2003, the musical reality you lived in was increasingly being determined by which online communities you frequented. This was a trend that would only intensify during Web 2.0, when social media took over the media landscape.\n\nAs noted at the top of this article, this is the final post of season 4 — the rise of digital culture from 1994-2003.

Professionals now spend more time with colleagues than with anyone else, and strong personal ties at work are directly linked to trust, learning, creativity, and performance. The real obstacle to productive business friendships is the widespread belief that mixing the personal and professional inevitably cheapens relationships, a mindset that prevents people from forming connections that would make them more effective and happier. When people instead allow genuine friendships to overlap with their professional networks, they build larger, more useful networks, collaborate more openly, and experience greater well-being.

    "description": "Business leaders can’t outsource mathematical thinking to AI without sacrificing judgment, because real-world business problems demand practical, approximate reasoning rather than pristine textbook solutions. Drawing on examples from tech, finance, and decision science, the article shows why leaders must learn to sanity-check models, think probabilistically, and distinguish sound decisions from noisy outcomes. It also explains how non-linear dynamics and smart “bet sizing” shape long-term results—making math fluency a core leadership skill in the AI era.",

In just one week, EA will take the online-multiplayer game offline, meaning it won't be playable starting January 12.\nEA officially announced that Anthem would be shut down in July 2025. This gave players roughly half-a-year to return to the RPG and to spend any leftover currency they had for the title.

    "description": "The rumor that Melania Trump escorted before meeting her now-husband has been spreading for almost a decade.",
    "fullText": "In December 2025, social media posts on sites including X and Facebook shared images claiming that Melania Trump, the U.S. first lady, worked as an escort before she met her now-husband, President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to the posts, Melania Trump began escorting under a man named Paolo Zampolli, who was good friends with the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein and his associate Ghislaine Maxwell. Epstein was arrested on charges of child sex trafficking in 2019 and was later found dead by suicide in his jail cell. Maxwell was convicted of child sex trafficking in 2021.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=122243189684255019&set=pcb.122243189810255019\n\nSnopes readers searched the site looking \n\nThe claim that Melania Trump worked as an escort before meeting Donald Trump has been spreading online since at least August 2016, when the U.K.-based tabloid Daily Mail published an article making that allegation. In August 2025, Hunter Biden, the son of former President Joe Biden, claimed that Epstein introduced the two in an interview on Channel 5, a YouTube channel run by journalist Andrew Callaghan.\n\nHowever, according to the BBC and NPR, Melania Trump sued the Daily Mail and a blogger in the U.S. who also shared the claim for defamation, seeking $150 million in damages. Her lawyer, Charles Harder, told the BBC the claim was \"outright lying.\" She also threatened to sue Hunter Biden for $1 billion, according to the BBC.\n\nThe lawsuits could be viewed as SLAPP suits, a term that \"refers to lawsuits brought by individuals and entities to dissuade their critics from continuing to produce negative publicity,\" according to Cornell University's Legal Information Institute.\n\nHowever, both the blogger and the Daily Mail settled the lawsuits, retracted the articles and paid damages to Trump, according to Politico and previous reporting from Snopes. Meanwhile, in a follow-up video published on Channel 5, Biden refused to apologize for his comments, claiming the information has also been reported by journalist Michael Wolff, who has written 4 books on Trump's time in office, and by The New York Times. (The Times' story says Epstein claimed he introduced the two.)\n\nIn sum, there's no evidence that the claim, which came from a tabloid with a history of spreading unfounded rumors, has any basis in reality.\n\nThe rumor may have seemed believable because it sprinkled in small tidbits of true information. According to reporting from Today and The Times of London, the Trumps did indeed meet at a party hosted by Zampolli, a former modeling agent who represented Melania Trump in the 1990s. A 2016 profile of Melania Trump in Harper's Bazaar and a profile of Zampolli published by the digital magazine Air Mail also claimed that he introduced the couple.\n\nThe claim that Zampolli was Melania Trump's \"escort agent\" might feel somewhat intuitive, given their established connection — it is not unheard of for sex workers to moonlight as models. However, that claim is unfounded and has no evidence supporting it.\n\nFinally, the photo of Melania Trump with her roommate Matthew Atanian often attached to post spreading the rumor was legitimate. It appeared in a Times of London article published in 2016. Some posts claimed the photo showed Trump with Zampolli, and in one copypasta (text repeatedly copied and shared verbatim online), Atanian's name was misspelled as \"Matthew Arabian.\"\n\nBryant, Kenzie. \"Say What You Will About Melania Trump, but She Seems Like a Great Roommate.\" Vanity Fair, 18 Jun. 2020, https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2020/06/melania-trump-biography-revelations.\n\nDaily. \"Melania Trump - An Apology.\" Mail Online, 12 Apr. 2017, http://www.dailymail.co.uk/~/article-4404142/index.html.\n\n\"Donald and Melania Trump: A Timeline of Their Relationship.\" TODAY.Com, 20 Jan. 2025, https://www.today.com/popculture/donald-trump-melania-trump-relationship-timeline-rcna172256.\n\nGerstein, Josh. \"Maryland Judge Dismisses Melania Trump's Libel Suit against Daily Mail.\" Politico, 2 Feb. 2017, https://www.politico.com/blogs/under-the-radar/2017/02/melania-trumps-libel-suit-daily-mail-234578.\n\n\"Melania Trump Sues Daily Mail and US Blogger for $150m over Sex Worker Claims.\" BBC News, 1 Sep. 2016.

    "fullText": "The Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is often referred to as \"the most powerful tech event in the world,\" bringing together tech companies from around the globe to unveil their latest innovations. The massive event is held across various locations, including the Las Vegas Convention Center, The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and The Sphere, and is a staple event for both companies vying for recognition and media outlets that cover them. One day into \"Unveiled,\" the media-only prelude to the trade show, I landed on what might be my mantra for my CES 2026 experience.\n\n\"Cool, if true,\" Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt had said about a new product booth, summarizing how I felt about the conference as a whole. Since arriving in Las Vegas on Saturday as a skeptical first-time attendee, I have seen cancer-detecting scanners, smart irrigation systems, and more assistive robots than I can count. I have also rolled my eyes at tech-enabled shoe insoles, smart-companion teddy bears, and AI-powered dog leashes. But I have also seen more grounded tech that lives just at the edge of where science fiction and practicality meet: walk-assisting exoskeletons, smart helmets with fall detection and one-touch SOS commands, and assistive mobility tech that can convert any standard wheelchair into an electric one. In short, CES is both chock-full of BS and a glimpse into the future of clever, helpful, and groundbreaking tech.\n\nTech Editor Jake Peterson, Senior Health Editor Beth Skwarecki, Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt, and I will be on the ground at CES throughout the week, covering the biggest, coolest, and weirdest tech we can find. We'll also join CNET, PCMag, and others in awarding the Best of CES 2026 awards for a second year in a row. Follow us here and on social media to see what it's like to be at the world's biggest technology trade show, and share with us your thoughts, questions, and what you'd like to see. There's a lot more cool tech to come. If true, of course.\n\n-Jordan Calhoun, Editor in Chief",

    "description": "With sensors on a handle, and a screen to display data, the Body Scan 2 may replace a smartwatch in addition to a smart scale.",
    "fullText": "Withings launched their $600 Body Scan 2 smart scale at CES Unveiled last night—but they're positioning it as a \"longevity station\" rather than a smart scale. The device has a handle in addition to the footplate, which allows for extra sensors, and the new features include things like hypertension notifications that we've previously seen from smartwatches. (Hypertension notifications only just came to the Apple Watch a few months ago.)\n\nI got to see the Body Scan 2 at a CES event but haven't had a chance to use it for myself. According to Withings, the Body Scan 2 can measure \"60+ biomarkers\" that it says are relevant to tracking your health over time. With the caveat that I'm asking the company \n\nSmart scales generally aren't very accurate for data like body fat percentage, or really anything that goes beyond simple body weight. A typical smart scale runs a weak electrical current from one foot to another, measuring the electrical resistance of your lower legs. The Body Scan 2 adds a handle with electrodes, which brings the upper body into the mix. The screen on the handle also allows it to display data like ECG readings or other detailed results. Since the screen is in your hands, you don't have to squint at a display at your feet. (In product photos, the retractable handle sits on top of the footplate, but at yesterday's demo, Withings had the handles mounted on little holders at hand height.\n\nThis setup allows for more detailed data than smart scales can usually measure. For example, a Withings rep told me yesterday that it can measure arterial stiffness by comparing the timing of your pulse in your torso, hands, and feet—the faster blood flows between these areas, the better. The Body Scan 2 uses impedance cardiography, a well-studied technology that can measure several aspects of heart health, and it includes a six-lead ECG. This means you can get ECG data and hypertension notifications—two headline Apple Watch features—without having to wear a watch every day.\n\nThe scale isn't yet available for sale, but Withings estimates that it will be available in the second quarter of this year, pending FDA clearance for some features. The price will be $599.95. Withings already sells a first-generation Body Scan scale, with a handle but with fewer sensors and without a screen on the handle, for $399.95.",

    "description": "What did 2025 mean for young people?",
    "fullText": "Before we toss the year 2025 onto the temporal dungheap where it belongs, let's take a look back at the year that has passed from the point of view of the people who have to live here even longer than we have to. Below is a month-by-month replay of the year, focusing on the memes, events, and ideas that shape and define Generations Z and Alpha.\n\nFor Gen Z, 2025 began with a panic that turned into a unique cross-cultural experiment. In January 2025, ByteDance, the Chinese company behind TikTok, announced that it was about to shut down the social media platform in the U.S. Ahead of the shut-down (which didn't end up happening) a wave of TikTokers moved over to RedNote, another Chinese social media platform, but one that was previously only used in China. The result was a few weeks where very different cultures met on common ground, and it was low-key beautiful. Young people from China and the U.S. asked each other questions about their respective cultures, TikTok refugees showed off their newly acquired Mandarin-speaking skills, while RedNoters demonstrated their English by doing a lot of imitations of Donald Trump, and everyone learned we weren't all that different. But it was only temporary: The geopolitical drama was solved (for now), TikTok stayed open, and TikTokers, for the most part, went back to their digital home—but hopefully young people took a little empathy with them.\n\nLike it or not, 2025 is the year of 6-7. The ubiquitous slang term really started in late 2024 with the release of Skrilla's \"Doot Doot (6 7)\" video on YouTube, but it took a couple months to catch on and filter down to the schoolyard, and a few more months to become the biggest slang word of the year. As I'm sure you know by now, \"6-7\" doesn't mean anything specific, it's just a fun thing to say, but even with no definition, 6-7 has remarkable staying power. Even after every parent and teacher on Earth learned what it meant, kids kept saying it. Whatever was funny about the joke hasn't been funny for a long time, so maybe 2026 will see the death of 6-7, but I wouldn't put money on it. It seems like one of those jokes that will go from funny to unfunny and back to funny a million times until it finally dies.\n\nIn March, Netflix released the series Adolescence, a distressing exploration of the inner worlds of alienated young men. In Adolescence, one of the teenage characters mentions the “80/20 rule” as a way of explaining the incel/red pill culture central to the murder plot and central to the worldview of too many real-life young men. Put simply, the 80/20 rule is an axiom that states 80% of women are attracted to only 20% of men. Despite being based on almost nothing, in incel spaces, the 80/20 rule is regarded as absolute truth, and the 80/20 rule (and other \"mano-sphere\" ideas) are spreading to more mainstream young people. Understanding the pervasiveness of belief in the 80/20 rule is essential to understanding the specific strain of misogyny that's afflicting young people. There's a helplessness implied by it—the 80/20 rule, like the rest of incels' elaborate theories about how men and women relate to each other, boils down to \"it's not my fault, and there's nothing I can do to change my situation.\" The spread of the 80/20 rule is the almighty algorithm rewarding the worst in people, and victims often have too few real-life relationships to reveal the obvious flaw in the rule's logic.\n\nIn their fractured and balkanized media landscape, Generations Z and A have few shared cultural experiences, but in 2025, A Minecraft Movie was a rare exception. The pre-release buzz (and \"chicken-jockey!\" memes) suggested that many young people were expecting an ironically enjoyable experience—something \"so bad it's good\"—but A Minecraft Movie is actually so good it's good, and appealed to everyone, younger kids, teenagers, and parents alike. Tapping Jared Hess—who helmed Napoleon Dynamite—to direct was inspired, as was the casting of Jack Black and Jason Momoa, but the real star of A Minecraft Movie is Minecraft, a video game that was released in 2009 and still has an estimated 200 million people (mostly young) playing it regularly. The success of A Minecraft Movie (and The Super Mario Bros Movie in 2023) indicates that Hollywood has finally figured out how to make decent movies out of video games.\n\n\"Who would win in a fight to the death, one gorilla or 100 men?\" sounds like a dumb question at first, but the more you think about it, the deeper it gets. My first thought was 100 men are taking it, no problem, but then I considered the overwhelming power of an enraged gorilla, how it could literally tear off limbs and bite off faces, and the scale started tipping heavily the other way. No matter where you land on the answer, the question is fascinating, and the internet was briefly obsessed with this imaginary battle in May. Taking a broader view, the debates, memes, and TikTok videos the gorilla question birthed are an illustration of how the technology that connects us took what would have been an interesting hypothetical discussion among a few weird friends 20 years ago and turned it into a worldwide discussion and convenient excuse to learn about primates.\n\n\"Steal a Brainrot\" came out in late May 2025, and by June, all the kids were playing it; 20 million of them, anyway. \"Steal a Brainrot\" is a multiplayer mini-game within maxi-games Roblox and Fortnite. In a game of Brainrot, up to eight players share a server, and each has their own base. The object of the game is to buy brainrots for your base and/or steal brainrots from other players' bases, while defending your own brainrots from thieves. The brainrots themselves are objects meant to reference \"Italian brainrot,\" i.e.: low-quality internet memes. They vary in value and have vaguely Italian names, but they aren't based on actual brainrot memes. The lesson: Good game design only needs the lightest hook to create a compelling experience.\n\nIn July, teachers and parents posted videos that may point to one of the most defining cultural touchstones of Generation Alpha: they don't think fart jokes are funny. They don't laugh when someone farts in public. They don't feel the need to say \"He who smelt it, dealt it.\" I realize a couple TikTok videos is the opposite of hard evidence, but judging from the comments and the kids being interviewed, it feels true, and important. Gen A don't seem like they're trying to be accepting of others, or mature; they seem genuinely bewildered by the idea that anyone would think farts are funny. Which is cool; they're right. But still, I can't help but feel sad for the poor fart jokes that have brought us all so much joy for so many centuries.\n\nThe \"performative male\" is another \"gift\" from the toxic-masculinity corner of youth culture. The term is an insult young men throw at other young men whose tastes, hobbies, and lifestyle are seen as a performance aimed at obtaining societal approval, especially the approval of young women. Performative male traits include matcha lattes, Labubu toys, listening to Clairo, tote bags, and reading in public. \"Performative male\" is mildly sexist on the surface—it's mocking dudes who like things associated with women (gasp)—but if you go deeper, it's similar to older slang words like “white knight” and “virtue signaling.” A performative male is fundamentally dishonest, because no real man would read in public, so it must be fake, and why would men be fake if not to make women like them?\n\nIf young people are going to remember any news story from 2025, it's likely to be the one about singer D4vd. On September 8, Los Angeles police discovered a body in the trunk of an abandoned Tesla registered to 20-year-old musician David Anthony Burke, aka D4vd. The body was later identified as the remains of Celeste Rivas, who was reported missing from her home in Riverside on April 5, 2024, when she was just 13 years old.\n\nThe singer's rise to fame is a quintessentially Generation Z story. His career began with online fame gained through posting Fortnite videos online, but YouTube removed his content for using copyrighted music. At the suggestion of his mom, D4vd began recording original songs using free iPhone tools, which he posted to SoundCloud. The end result was a recording contract, an album, a couple of moody, dreamy songs with over 1.5 billion plays on Spotify, and a body in the trunk of a car.\n\nD4vd has not been charged with any crimes in connection with the body, but neither has anyone else, so this story is likely to continue into 2026.\n\nThis year, young people in Portland changed the perception of what \"protesting\" means. At demonstrations against Federal immigration enforcement, young people started showing up dressed in colorful, inflatable Halloween costumes. Frog guy was first. Then chicken guy. Then a panoply of unicorns and other fanciful creatures. The idea seems to be to highlight the farce of a heavy police presence on American streets by appearing as harmless as possible. Protestors have been using ridiculousness to make their point since protests began, but the instant, worldwide dissemination of videos from Portland's \"front line\" is fairly new, and they really deliver the message. Images of heavily armed and armored law enforcement officers staring down Portland weirdos in unicorn and panda costumes makes a more compelling point than would clashes with radicals in ski masks—you don't have to think very hard to know which side you're on.\n\nA quarter zip is a pullover sweater with a zipper that goes a quarter way down the chest, and it's becoming the go-to look for young men, especially Black men. Wearing a quarter zip isn't exactly \"dressed up,\" but it's more sophisticated than rocking athleisure wear. More importantly, the quarter zip is often a signifier of status and intention. Like flannel shirts in previous generations, the quarter zip is marks one as belonging to an in group, being a “quarter zip man,\" and the even being part of the “quarter zip movement.”\n\nThe younger generation closed out the year by looking backwards, but only a little bit backwards. The trend of December was \"millennial optimism,\" the romanticization of the years around 2010. Some younger people imagine it as as a more innocent, hopeful time that they missed out on, and many millennials who were setting those trends in the 2010s are feeling nostalgic for their lost youth/relevance, so both groups are posting TikTok videos about \"millennial optimism.\" Being older than both groups, I can say with confidence that both groups are wrong for different reasons. \"Missed-out-on-it\" types are wrong because a period that included the recession of 2008 and the election of Donald Trump was not \"optimistic,\" and the millennials only think of it as a fun, awesome time because it's when millennials were young (and having a fun, awesome time.)",

    "title": "Why I'm Never Going to Let AI Write My Emails",
    "description": "It's tempting to offload email to AI—but I, for one, will resist the urge.",
    "fullText": "Need some help writing your emails? Through the wonders of AI and Large Language Models (LLMs), you can now get messages composed on your behalf in Gmail, in Apple Mail, in Outlook, and in many other email clients. Most of the time, the AI option pops up straight away, ready to give you however much assistance you need.\n\nThe pitch is that you can offload the drudgery of dealing with email to AI, and move on to other tasks that may be more interesting and important. Anecdotally, I've spoken to quite a few people who now use AI chatbots in this way. But it's not something I'm ready to embrace, and I don't think I ever will.\n\nThese are my reasons, which may or may not resonate with you, though I haven't mentioned the issues of energy use and copyright violations that hang over the use of AI more generally. You can keep asking if I want some help in Gmail, Gemini, but I'd rather switch you off altogether.\n\nWriting's pretty easy, really—most of us can do it from an early age without too much trouble. Writing well is harder, but you don't have to be a best-selling author to fire off a few emails. So is there any harm in using AI for some low-level email composing? It may be quicker and more convenient, but I'm not sure it's actually beneficial.\n\nAs author David McCullough once said: \"Writing is thinking.\" The skill of being able to choose the right word to put in front of the previous one gets the cogs of the brain moving, and forces some thought about what's being said. Word choice and sentence structure matters, even on the shortest and most banal of emails.\n\nI don't want to sit down at a laptop one day and find myself struggling to compose a few lines of text. Is that far-fetched? Perhaps not, based on reports from those who've already tried farming out emails to AI. \"Is it difficult trying to get that thought in your head translated to an email?\" asks Google. Well, yes, it is, and that's sort of the point.\n\nIt's fair to say a lot of us get an excessive amount of email (if you don't, consider yourself lucky). Chances are that plenty of your incoming email will be from people you don't know personally, but no matter the sender and the recipient in an email conversation, I think human responses are worth the effort.\n\nIf all of our emails—arranging work drinks, applying for jobs, discussing a project—are written by AI, then we're heading for piles and piles of machine-written missives that lack any kind of nuance or personal touch. Imagine a group email chain where every response sounds the same, irrespective of who sent it.\n\nEven if I'm writing a simple \"no thanks\" email, if I'm communicating with another human being, I'm of the opinion that they deserve a response that has come straight from me. This is more of a principled stance than anything else, but I'm sticking with it.\n\nGet AI to write a thank you note to someone who hosted an event you recently attended, for example, and you're going to get a rather generic spiel that's the averaging out of countless other thank you notes. It's going to be bland, impersonal, and forgettable.\n\nI can see the temptation to use AI to compose an important email—applying for a job, maybe, or appealing against a company decision—but your message is likely to end up reading like the algorithm-processed, mass-produced text that it is. You're going to sound like everyone else, basically (see the previous point).\n\nYou could get AI to do a draft and then edit it, but if I started down this path, I could see myself making fewer and fewer edits to my messages, out of laziness or habit.\n\nAI still makes lots of mistakes, though the chatbot developers don't tend to mention them much. If you're drafting an email about a new project pitch, a family get-together, a customer inquiry or whatever it is, there's no guarantee that an AI will get all the details right.\n\nThe more important the content of the email, the more important this becomes. The companies pushing AI-driven emails seem to be of the opinion that we can all be chasing business leads, organizing colleagues, and expressing heartfelt feelings over email with the help of AI, but I'm not convinced.\n\nPeople make mistakes as well, but I'd rather trust myself than a black box of algorithms that aren't even fully understood by the developers who code them. Does AI know the people I'm emailing, and the specific details they need? Of course not.\n\nTo paraphrase George Orwell, if you want a picture of the future, imagine your AI sending thousands of emails a minute to everyone else's AIs, forever. At what point do we abdicate responsibility completely to chatbots, and just let them get on with it? I don't even want to take a single step towards that.\n\nRight now, not even the most enthusiastic AI fans are suggesting that we start sending AI-written emails out into the ether without checking and editing them first, but isn't that the obvious next step? I can almost see the Google I/O on-stage presentation now—get Gemini to handle everything, for the ultimate productivity boost.\n\nPreliminary studies already show that we forget almost everything we write using AI, which has worrying implications if we're sending out important information that needs to be recalled later. It's not a future I'm going to be signing up for, no matter how insistent the AI prompts get.",

    "title": "Jelly Roll Shocked at How Weight Impacted His Testosterone and Sex Life -- Where He's at Today",
    "description": "In a yearlong interview with Men's Health, Jelly Roll opens up about his struggles with addiction, topping the scales at more than 520 pounds in 2020, and how he's managed to lose half his body weight.",
    "fullText": "Jelly Roll (aka Jason Bradley DeFord) is loving the new life he's worked hard to achieve. The Grammy-nominated country superstar opened up with Men's Health about his weight-loss journey, opening up about some of the startling things he learned at the beginning, and how far he's come.\n\nTopping out at more than 520 pounds (Jelly explained that his scale maxed out there and he could not move it at all, \"so it could have been 560, it could have been 528.\" Jelly said he reached his maximum weight around 2020.\n\nWorking with The Ultimate Human founder Gary Brecka and wellness clinic Ways2Well, Jelly started by getting himself under 500 pounds and assessing where he was. He was also adamant that he didn't want to use GLP-1 drugs to achieve his results, saying, \"I don't want an asterisk next to my name, bubba. I want to show people that this is possible.\"\n\nMen's Health notes that after publication, Jelly did admit to trying these drugs for two weeks before committing himself to achieving his goals without them.\n\nAt the start, he took a full blood panel, and learned some startling results about his insulin levels, \"super high\" and his testosterone levels, super low.\n\n\"When you have an excessive amount of insulin, it forces your body to store fat,\" Ways2Well nurse practitioner Danese Rexroad told Men's Health. \"So switching those receptors and switching what Jelly’s body was signaling with insulin helped him rapidly adjust his insulin resistance. I wasn’t doing a big science experiment. It was just meal timing and eating real foods.\" He was also put on a drug to treat Type 2 diabetes.\n\nHis A1C, which measures sugars in the blood, was so high, Jelly said that \"the first couple of blood panels were like, how are you alive?\"\n\nThe other number that left the singer truly shocked was his T. \"My testosterone level -- and I’m cool to talk about this openly -- was of a preteen boy,\" Jelly told the magazine. \"When I went in there for the test, it was bad. Bad. The world opened up when I seen it on paper. I was like, That’s my testosterone level? I mean, dude, we’re talking a 57.\"\n\nA normal t-level for a man Jelly's age is between 300 ng/dL to 900 ng/dL, while obesity commonly reduces those numbers. But a reduction in testosterone can have a huge impact on a man, and especially when it comes to his romantic life.\n\nJelly went there, talking about struggles in his intimate relationship with Bunnie Xo, with whom he's been married since 2016. \"You can’t get it up without T,\" he said candidly. \"I was married to a smoke show, and I was still struggling.\"\n\nHe said that a team came together to look at the root causes behind his health issues, rather than just give him medications to address the symptoms, though medication is a part of the process. \"I'll be on testosterone replacement therapy probably for the rest of my life,\" Jelly admitted to Men's Health.\n\nNevertheless, what his body could adjust and change for the better, Jelly says has been happening. \"That' was a big part of my journey: wanting to know what's happening within me.\"\n\nFor Jelly, who admitted that food was as much an addiction for him as cocaine and codeine had been during his years in and out of the prison system, he's learned that it's about setting small goals. Every time he'd decide to do everything it takes to lose weight, he'd fail, so he started with just one of those things -- and he recommends that one thing be food.\n\n\"Start there. F--k everything else,\" he said. \"Just commit yourself to 'I'm gonna count every calorie and macro that goes in my mouth.'\"\n\nHe was also clear in learning that he needed to shift his goal. He wasn't trying to lose weight, he was trying to be healthy. That's why the focus on blood panels and knowing what's going on inside. The scale only tells one part of the story.\n\nIn 2021, Jelly hired chef/sports nitritionist Ian Larios, who has worked with some MMA champions. Jelly, a huge fan of MMA, found him through this route and one of the first things he told him was that he wanted to appear on the cover of Men's Health magazines.\n\nIn December 2024, he reiterated this goal, \"to be on the cover of Men's Health in 2026. The magazine has come to mean a lot to him, he explained, because he would read it in jail and be inspired by the stories and transformations within its pages. He wanted his own journey to be told there.\n\nMen's Health followed him for a year, watching his healthy journey throughout 2025 before granting his dream with the first issue of the new year. Along with the dramatic change in his body, the magazine noted that when they returned to visit him in November, he proudly declared that his healthier body is a different man in the bedroom, too.\n\n\"Now it’s a totally different thing. I’m chasing her around the house, you know what I’m saying?,\" he laughed. \"I’m like a teenage kid again! I'm like the Pink Panther: I bust out of every corner. And she opens the cabinet and I go, 'Hi!'\"\n\n\"Dramatically different world,\" he declared. Next up is loose skin removal, which he is planning for sometime this year. The journey continues.",

    "title": "4 Habits to Break If You’re Trying to Lose Visceral Fat",
    "description": "Visceral fat is a hidden health risk, but small lifestyle changes can help reduce it.",
    "fullText": "Reviewed by Dietitian Madeline Peck, RDN, CDN\n\nVisceral fat surrounds the organs and is linked to conditions like type 2 diabetes.\n\nSugary drinks, stress, smoking and poor sleep can all drive visceral fat gain.\n\nLifestyle changes like eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise can reduce visceral fat.\n\nVisceral fat is a term that often comes up in discussions about health and wellness, and for good reason. Unlike the fat you can pinch just under your skin (subcutaneous fat), visceral fat is the deeper fat stored around the abdominal organs. Higher levels are linked to insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver disease and heart disease, per Raksha Shah, M.A., RDN. Visceral fat is more involved in metabolic processes due to its proximity to organs such as our liver, pancreas and intestines, which is why it is more closely associated with poor health outcomes than other kinds of fat. It is also very responsive to lifestyle changes. By understanding what to avoid, you can take effective steps toward reducing visceral fat and improving your overall well-being.\n\nSugar-sweetened  sodas are a top offender when it comes to visceral fat gain. Loaded with added sugar, these drinks provide a surge of calories but fail to help you feel full or provide any nutrients. Because regular sodas are a potent source of added sugar, they can easily lead to excessive sugar consumption. In order to manage this extra sugar, the liver turns it into fat.  Over time, this process facilitates the buildup of visceral fat around your organs. Data has linked routine consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, like sodas and sweet tea, to higher visceral fat accumulation. Instead of drinking sugary drinks, opt for alternatives like water, unsweetened tea or sparkling water with a splash of fruit juice.\n\nStress is something everyone deals with, but unmanaged, ongoing stress can make it much harder to lose abdominal fat. “Chronic stress doesn’t just affect your mood; it can upset the hormonal balance in your body and lead to more visceral fat accumulation in various areas,” shares Toby Amidor, M.S., RD. Data shows that people with higher stress levels tend to have more visceral fat. When you’re stressed, your body releases more of the hormone cortisol, which has been directly linked to increased abdominal fat storage.\n\nTaking steps to manage stress, such as mindfulness practices, exercise or carving out time for activities you enjoy, can pay off in both your mental well-being and your physical health.\n\nPeople who smoke cigarettes tend to have lower body weights than nonsmokers. But, perhaps surprisingly, they also have more visceral fat. Data suggest that there is a link between prolonged smoking, greater nicotine dependence and increased visceral fat. This connection may be due to the way smoking affects hormones and fat distribution in the body. Nicotine can increase levels of cortisol, a stress hormone that promotes fat storage in the abdominal area. This redistribution of fat can occur even in individuals who appear lean, making smoking a hidden risk factor for visceral fat accumulation.\n\n“Sleep might not be the first thing you think of when it comes to visceral fat, but it plays a role,” says Amidor. A chronic lack of quality sleep can wreak havoc on your hormones, particularly those that regulate appetite and stress. When you are sleep-deprived, your body tends to produce more ghrelin, the “hunger hormone,” and less leptin, the hormone that signals fullness. This hormonal imbalance can lead to increased cravings that result in excess calorie intake, contributing to visceral fat.\n\nPoor sleep also elevates levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Aiming for seven to nine hours of quality sleep per night can help regulate your hormones, manage your appetite and reduce stress, creating a more favorable environment for your body to lose visceral fat. “Establishing a consistent sleep schedule and creating a relaxing bedtime routine can significantly improve your sleep quality and support your health goals,” Amidor advises.\n\nWhile avoiding certain habits is important, incorporating positive ones is just as crucial. The following are some additional strategies for shedding visceral fat and achieving healthy weight loss:\n\nPrioritize Protein: Including a good source of protein with every meal helps you feel full and satisfied, which can reduce overall calorie intake and support muscle maintenance during weight loss.\n\nFill Up on Fiber: Fiber, found in foods like oats, beans and apples, can help reduce visceral fat by slowing digestion and promoting feelings of fullness.\n\nRegular Exercise: A combination of moderate-intensity cardio (like brisk walking or cycling) and strength training may help reduce visceral fat and improve your overall metabolic health.\n\nVisceral fat may be hidden from view, but its impact on your health is anything but invisible. Because it is more metabolically active than other forms of fat, visceral adipose tissue can increase the risk of developing chronic conditions such as diabetes and heart disease. The good news? You can manage visceral fat with just a few lifestyle changes. By making mindful choices like swapping soda for sparkling water, managing stress, quitting smoking, prioritizing sleep, embracing a balanced diet and getting regular exercise, you can take meaningful steps to reduce visceral fat and improve your overall health.",

    "fullText": "Age 65 is a major transition for many individuals as they shift to thinking about retirement and begin to contemplate benefits like Social Security and Medicare. Retirement planning means you’ll have to consider taxes, healthcare, your retirement budget and more. With $1.5 million in an IRA and two Social Security payments to rely on, a married couple should have some flexibility for retirement, but their individual circumstances and how they strategize can make a big difference in their quality of life. Here’s how to think about it.\n\nIf you need help planning and saving for retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.\n\nIf you’re approaching retirement, the first area to examine is your expected savings, income and planned retirement date. Basically, how much money will you have and when? Your income, both from your portfolio and your benefits, will depend heavily on when you choose to retire.\n\nFor example, let’s say you’re currently 65, have started collecting Social Security and your IRA is invested in a mixed-asset portfolio with an 8% annual rate of return. If you retire at 67 (full retirement age) and don’t plan to continue contributing to your account, here’s what your finances could look like at retirement:\n\nBenefits: $4,200/month ($50,400/year)\n\nOn the other hand, say that you wait until age 70 to retire and claim your Social Security. Again, take an 8% average return on a mixed-asset portfolio and discount additional contributions. By retirement you might have:\n\nBenefits: $5,208/month ($62,496/year)\n\nFor the purposes of this article, we’ll assume that you retire at 67. The point here is that delaying retirement can help you increase your retirement budget in many cases. And if you need help determining a suitable time to retire, connect with a financial advisor and talk it over.\n\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.\n\nOnce you know how much income you can expect to generate each year, the next step is to make a budget for it.\n\n“When determining a retirement budget, the goal isn’t just to ensure your money lasts, but to ensure it lasts in a way that maintains your quality of life,” said Aaron Cirksena, CEO and Founder of MDRN Capital. “With $1.5 million in an IRA and a steady stream of Social Security benefits, it’s about balancing the financial priorities with personal priorities. You calculate based on expected needs and foreseeable expenses, but also on the less tangible aspects — like aspirations, goals, dreams and the peace of mind.”",

    "description": "Stephen...",
    "fullText": "Has James Cameron’s epic sci-fi series run aground?\n\nJames Cameron’s latest Avatar movie opens with a scene of innocent wonder. Two young brothers soar through the air on winged beasts, taking in the vertiginous views of their majestic home world. Both are Na’Vi, lithe bipedal inhabitants of the verdant moon Pandora introduced back in 2009 in the series’ first entry. The boys experience Pandora as a playground, its psychedelic flora and fauna a boundless source of delight. The catch is that one of the brothers is dead. The shared flight is possible only because a ritual (and literal) connection to nature and their world’s shared memory allows the living one, Lo’ak (Brian Dalton), to commune with his older sibling, Neteyam (Jamie Flatters). For the Na’Vi, the environment is kindred, so much so that a special organ lets them link to the planet itself.\n\nThat bond, and the transcendental encounters it makes possible, are threatened in Avatar: Fire and Ash. In Cameron’s third trip to this edenic land, the conflict between the conscientious Na’Vi and the greedy, spacefaring earthlings of the first two films has escalated into full-blown warfare. In the previous movie, 2022’s Avatar: The Way of Water, Neteyam died in a climactic battle between the humans and the Na’Vi, a loss that haunts the sequel. Now his surviving family, the Sullys, must mourn Neteyam while rallying to fight for the future of Pandora.\n\nThese themes—war, grief, colonization, environmental calamity—are the stuff of epics, but Cameron can’t escape bland allegory. The Na’Vi, already a thin puree of New Age woo-woo and stereotypical indigeneity, get further diluted in Fire and Ash. In an attempt to complicate his noble savages, Cameron introduces ignoble ones: the Ash people, a group of pyromaniac Na’Vi who’ve turned against their kind because their village was destroyed by a volcanic eruption. When the Ash people team up with the humans, Pandora for the first time faces both internal and external threats. But the new antagonists only further underscore how thinly the Na’Vi have been portrayed since the first movie.\n\nFire and Ash cements the emptiness of Avatar. The blockbuster series is supposed to be about clashing civilizations and their disparate relationships to nature, but across nine hours of screentime, it has relied on rigid binaries: machine versus organic, alien versus native, science versus magic. Cameron’s incurious characters rarely seek out third (or fourth) positions or express and experience wonder on their own terms. Since it ushered in the modern age of 3D filmmaking back in 2009, Avatar has been touted as a series to look at, to get lost in. But the deeper Cameron plunges into this fictional universe, the shallower it proves to be.\n\nFire and Ash ramps up quickly. After opening with the brothers in flight, the film checks in with the rest of the Sullys, who are also struggling to cope with Neteyam’s death. Stoic dad Jake (Sam Worthington), the former Marine who became a Na’Vi in the first film, broods and compiles weapons for the coming battles. Meanwhile, warrior mother Neytiri (Zoe Saldana) seethes, casting foul glances at their adopted son, Spider (Jake Champion), a human raised among the Na’Vi who’s essentially a teenage Tarzan. And flowerchild Na’Vi Kiri (Sigourney Weaver), another adopted Sully, longs to reconnect with nature, which has mysteriously shut her out. Concerns about Spider’s ability to breathe, which requires gas masks because Pandoran air is toxic to humans, result in the family’s joining a convoy of “Wind Traders” to take him to an area safe for humans.\n\nThe Traders hint at a more complex story. Despite the winged creatures they’ve flown on since the first film, Na’Vi have previously been depicted as territorial, rarely venturing far from where they roost. It makes you wonder: Is there a Na’Vi economy? Do they exchange information about the encroachment of humans? How far apart are these communities?\n\nCameron glosses over such possibilities, instead relishing the otherworldly spectacle of the carriages, which are designed as a kind of organic steampunk hot air balloon. Flying creatures reminiscent of manta rays pull the vessels, while the “balloons” resemble pearlescent jellyfish. It’s certainly a sight, but after the Ash people attack the convoy, the story leaves behind the traders, and any interest in wider Na’Vi perspectives.\n\nFrom there, Fire and Ash becomes an elaborate game of cat and mouse as the Sullys elude central antagonist Quaritch (Stephen Lang), a commando reborn in The Way of Water as a Na’Vi hell-bent on capturing Jake. Quaritch casts Jake as the ultimate species traitor, boasting, “Doesn’t matter what color I am, I remember what team I’m playing for.” But he finds himself venturing down the same path as his nemesis: Like Jake, Quaritch has become increasingly comfortable with Na’vi ways of life despite his allegiance to Earth, an irony that deepens when he falls for the fiery Varang (Oona Chaplin) of the Ash people. They bond over their mutual bloodlust, with Quaritch suggestively vowing to help Varang “spread your fire across the world.”\n\nQuaritch’s human son, Spider, a minor character in the previous film, becomes a centerpiece, one of the film’s thorniest turns. Through a twist, he becomes able to breathe the planet’s air, which makes him a high-value target for the humans. If they can reverse-engineer the process that lets him breathe, human colonization can ramp up. Neytiri, fearing that outcome and motivated by a growing hatred for humans, suggests killing Spider, a move Jake opposes and later considers. Spider, meanwhile, feels increasingly attached to Pandora, and even grows the Na’Vi organ that allows communion with nature, muddying the line between native and alien.\n\nThere’s a lot going on here: contested paternity, purist ideas of kinship, extinction, racial allegiance and grievance. But the film rarely slows enough to push these threads in fruitful directions, always charging toward the next big battle or twist. Cameron’s understanding of difference is too simplistic to make these shifting views feel revelatory. We see this when the Ash people enlist with Quaritch in exchange for guns. As part of the arrangement, they move to Pandora’s human hub, and have no trouble adjusting. Likewise, when Spider is captured and taken to that same city, the story speeds through what should be a dizzying predicament: Spider is among his species, but these are not his people, all while poised to be the savior for his homeland and the destroyer of his adopted one.\n\nThere’s little internal turmoil  amid all the body-hopping and species-mingling. Cameron’s characters bicker and fight without ever transforming, often giving hokey reasons for their inertia. “The people say that when you touch steel, its poison seeps into your heart,” Lo’ak says at one point, describing an arbitrary Na’Vi prohibition against metal. The Na’Vi have literally been invaded by aliens, but Cameron can only imagine them as folksy mystics.\n\nThe failures of Fire and Ash are all tied up in that strange and artificial fixity of the Na’Vi. Over the course of the series, they have experienced human colonization for decades—enough time for humans to build a city, for businesses on Earth to be involved in intergalactic extraction of Pandoran resources, for some Na’Vi to learn English, and for Jake, a former human, to start a family. But this history has the barest footprint. Na’Vis call humans “Sky people” and “pink skins,” shorthands that signify racial difference more than planetary or political divergence. Speaking of planets, despite living on a moon, the Na’Vi oddly don’t even have a cosmology: We never learn the name of the planet the moon revolves around, or learn Na’Vi beliefs about what lies beyond Pandora’s atmosphere. Cameron gives them a religion, a global spirit they call Eywa, but their conception of nature is ultimately terrestrial and static, bound to the soil. That choice reveals how flatly Cameron imagines his hero race.\n\nThat flat vision lingers even if you try to enjoy the popcorn thrills of Fire and Ash. Yes, it boasts the bleeding edge of digital effects, and is relentlessly filigreed with textures and colors. Although it was shot at the same time as The Way of Water, Fire and Ash is even more dazzling: the flame motif results in chiaroscuro shadows and lighting even in underwater scenes. And the attention to detail is exquisite: At one point, a whale-like creature with septum piercings breaches water to speak with the Sullys, and when she speaks, the water around her ripples and splashes in perfectly imperfect concentric circles. The level of scrutiny applied to this story’s visual environment is endlessly stunning.\n\nBut that precision ultimately makes the innate flaws of the saga more unbearable. Despite how much more richly rendered the world has become across three movies, the denizens of Pandora have not been granted much interiority or depth: Cameron’s Na’Vi are virtuous stewards of the landscape; his humans are warmongering brutes. Pandora is a lush paradise, while Earth, which we never see, is a wasteland that’s just industrious enough to maintain interstellar capitalism. He attempts to invert those dynamics here with Spider, a valiant human who wants to be Na’Vi, and the Ash people, crazed fiends who want to make Pandora a wasteland, as well as the various arcs of the Sullys.\n\nBut the positions the characters can inhabit, the thoughts they can think and paths they can take, remain circumscribed—a determinism at odds with the romance and whimsy Cameron tries so hard to stoke. Fire and Ash is the dullest kind of science fiction, intricate but uninquisitive, sprawling but close-minded, the story never evolving past Cameron’s backhanded love for Indigenous environmentalism and fondness for loud, gee-whiz action. No matter how ornate the CGI gets, this series sticks to the same offensive premise: cowboys and Indians.",

    "fullText": "UAW Region 9A’s endorsement of Lander over one of the wealthiest members of Congress signals that pro-labor voting records alone no longer guarantee labor’s backing.\n\nThis morning, United Auto Workers Region 9A endorsed former New York City comptroller and City Council member Brad Lander for New York’s 10th Congressional District.\n\n“We have known and worked with Brad for years and know he walks the walk,” UAW Region 9A Director Brandon Mancilla explained. “In every role he’s served, he’s called out bad bosses, walked picket lines with all our locals, and leveraged the tools of his office to fight for workers. From housing to workers’ rights, we know Brad will be a steadfast champion for working people in Congress.”\n\nRegion 9A has established itself as a left-wing voice in the region. Representing more than 50,000 workers in the greater New York City area, New England, and Puerto Rico, the regional body has distinguished itself by backing socialist and progressives early in races, including against incumbent Democrats. Empowered by a revamped endorsement process and militant leadership locally and nationally, the union has not shied away from political risks. Region 9A previously co-endorsed Lander in his recent mayoral bid, alongside then-longshot democratic socialist Zohran Mamdani and Jessica Ramos. Now it will work in America’s third-wealthiest congressional district to unseat Representative Dan Goldman.\n\n“I’m deeply grateful to have the support of my longtime allies at UAW Region 9A, some of the best organizers in the country. They are making a powerful statement that working people don’t want billionaires buying seats in Congress,” Lander said. “For decades, I’ve worked with labor to ensure that workers don’t [get] screwed. In Congress, I’ll work with the UAW and other labor unions to ensure that workers don’t get screwed by AI, by app companies, or by billionaire bosses.”\n\nLander’s labor bona fides date back to his time on the City Council. In the 2010s, during the rise of the gig economy, he helped pass legislation that established just-cause protections for the fast-food industry, ended erratic scheduling for fast-food and retail workers, and created the nation’s first guaranteed living wage for rideshare drivers.\n\nAs comptroller—an independent municipal office tasked with overseeing the fiscal health of the city—Lander found creative ways to navigate the turbulence of Wall Street and expanded the scope of the office by establishing a “workers’ rights team” within the Bureau of Labor Law. “As comptroller, I recovered over $20 million for workers whose bosses cheated them out of the prevailing wages they were owed, and made sure the companies we invested in respected the rights of their workers to organize.”\n\nLander also touts endorsements from socialists like Mayor Zohran Mamdani and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders as well as progressives like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and the New York Working Families Party, which should carry weight in NY-10, one of the country’s Democratic strongholds.\n\nIn 2022, the district was redrawn to include parts of Lower Manhattan, South Brooklyn, and the brownstone neighborhoods of Brooklyn, including Lander’s Park Slope. The race that Goldman won, making the Levi Strauss heir one of the 10 wealthiest members of Congress, is now infamous among New York progressives—an example of what not to do when trying to secure a favorable district against a moderate candidate. A gaggle of left-liberal candidates, led by Yuh-Line Niou and Mondaire Jones, split the progressive vote; Goldman, who spent more than $4 million of his fortune, won the primary with just 26 percent of the vote.\n\nSince taking office, Goldman’s unqualified support of Israel and his acceptance of donations from AIPAC have curried little favor among his district’s progressives. He also refused to endorse Mamdani, who carried the 10th district with over 60 percent of the vote in the general election and nearly 70 percent in the primary. While Goldman has voted reliably for pro-labor legislation, Region 9A’s endorsement of Lander suggests that a strong AFL-CIO scorecard alone may no longer be sufficient as the labor movement seeks to steady itself against a Trump administration stocked with anti-union figures. The race will test whether organized labor’s growing impatience with wealth and caution inside the Democratic Party can translate into a primary upset.",

    "description": "Wen Stephenson, Andreas Malm, Thea...",
    "fullText": "Andreas Malm and Thea Riofrancos joined The Nation’s Wen Stephenson in an urgent conversation about the left and the climate emergency.\n\nOn December 19, Haymarket Books and Verso Books cosponsored a conversation about the left and the climate emergency, hosted by The Nation’s climate-justice correspondent, Wen Stephenson. In his introductory remarks, Stephenson drew on his recent Nation essay in which he quoted the “State of the Climate Report” for 2025, and made the following observation:\n\nIt’s no stretch, at this late date, to conclude that nothing short of revolution, in some form, will be required to salvage progressive visions of a better world. It should be obvious—and always should have been obvious—that climate activists, a mere climate movement, can’t do this alone. What’s required, and always has been, is not simply a broader, better organized, more powerful “climate left”; what’s required is a far more powerful left—a resurgent, revolutionary left—a movement of movements, a popular front in which the total defeat of fascism and of fossil capital are understood as inseparable.\n\nJoining Stephenson in conversation were Andreas Malm, associate professor of human ecology at Lund University, whose latest book, co-authored with Wim Carton, is The Long Heat: Climate Politics When It’s Too Late; and Thea Riofrancos, associate professor of political science at Providence College, whose latest book is Extraction: The Frontiers of Green Capitalism. The following are excerpts from the event.\n\nWen Stephenson: My broad opening question is this: Given the state of both climate science and global politics, is it still possible to imagine something like global justice, the historic project of the left? What kind of justice is still possible? Feel free to take issue with the question itself. Is it the right question?\n\nThea Riofrancos: I think it is a good question, but I think the framing might be a bit misleading, in the sense that both global justice and global solidarity—which are not the same thing but are connected to one another—are relational and relative concepts. Power relations are dynamic. We can have improvements in the balance of forces from a left perspective, and we can have defeats, and those defeats might be provisional.\n\nMore directly, if it’s the case—which the climate science continues to show—that every fraction of a degree of warming continues to matter, then every effort oriented towards the horizon of combating and transforming fossil capitalism also matters. That does not mean—and I want to be really clear about this—that we can’t distinguish between moments of defeat and moments of, again, always relative victory.\n\nA few years ago, I felt—political optimism is probably too strong a word—but I saw many more openings in the terrain for specifically left climate politics than I would, in all honesty, see in this particular moment. We can compare conjunctures. We can be honest about defeats and victories. We also need to be ruthless—though in a comradely fashion, hopefully—in our analysis of what tactics work, what strategies work, and be really honest about the state of scientific findings about how dire the situation is.\n\nBut I think the question of how to combat and transform fossil capitalism—I mean, we need to defeat and dismantle, but we also need to build something in the wreckage that is a saner economic system and relationship between humans and nature. So the task of combating and of transforming is more urgent and more enigmatic than ever. We are firmly in what Andreas and Wim call the “overshoot conjuncture.” And it’s actually unclear in a political sense, from left principles, how exactly we’re going to combat not just fossil capitalism in general but also the kind of deadly silence and denial that creates a veil around the climate crisis itself and makes it hard to directly address.\n\nI would just say, with the risk of being a little provocative, that this relative silence, and what we could even call forms of soft denialism, are pervasive on the left, including with people I work with and organizations I work with.\n\nI think there’s a real, urgent task of reconnecting the left to the climate crisis. And that itself is an internal battle within the left—or battle is maybe too antagonistic a term—because we’re going to need to persuade and agitate among our own political movements to refocus on this issue that has been unfortunately quite lost again, including on the left.\n\nThe human impacts are piling up, the catastrophes are piling up around us. And here in the US, fossil fascism has seized political power. But I also want to bring in the fact that the so-called center-left pundits and politicians are doubling down on climate denialism. We’ve had op-eds, for example by Matt Yglesias, saying Democrats should embrace oil and gas. And recently we had a Democratic lawmaker in Congress [Senator Ruben Gallego from Arizona] release his big energy plan, which also calls for doubling down on oil and gas. I mean, this is the center-left, let alone the right.\n\nBut as these centrist and fascist forces deny and deflect and double down on fossil fuels, the left is not centering this in our organizing or our movements.\n\nHere in the US, the reality is particularly stark. The US is a kind of epicenter of tech, fossil-fuel, oligarchic reaction that has increasingly consolidated and is shifting electoral outcomes around the world.\n\nAnd so the crux of the question remains under what conditions could we expect to see the formation of a mass, globally interconnected movement of a self-consciously climate character that directly targets all the nodes in the global supply chains—whether extraction, logistics, finance—of global fossil capitalism while also programmatically building towards what we might call our desired social form, whether we want to call it green social democracy, eco-socialism, carbon-free communism, or whatever we want to name as our vision for that horizon.\n\nShould we stay committed to the emergence of an explicitly climate movement, that has a specific target on fossil capitalism, versus other types of left movements and grassroots and popular struggles that are more indirect yet take aim at the same kind of global system very broadly construed?\n\nAndreas Malm: For an answer to the event’s framing question, “What justice on a burning planet?,” basically the answer must be none. Because the planet is burning through injustice, in the sense that the people that are caught in the fires are not the ones that have poured fuel on them. And the people who get richer by the day by pouring fuel on this fire can so far stay at a distance from the harm and the damage and the suffering.\n\nI don’t know of any better and more precise picture of this injustice than the scenes that we have seen playing out in Gaza over the past weeks, where hundreds of thousands of people that have managed to cling to life during this genocide have been struck by the blow of extreme flooding from storms. Children die, and people have their lives destroyed for what, is it the 10th time? The 100th time? There are so many layers of compounded injustice that come together at the beach in Gaza that it’s hard to wrap one’s head around it.\n\nI think the moment that we’re in right now is particularly stark for those of us who’ve been committed to two major mobilizations in the past decade, namely the climate movement and the Palestine movement. Because right now we’re in a situation where the climate movement is a shadow of its former self in the Global North. As for Palestine, we’ve had the largest Palestine mobilizations in history since the beginning of the genocide. But what happened after the announcement of the so-called ceasefire is that the Palestine issue, just like the climate issue, plunged to the bottom of the agenda, and the ongoing destruction of the Palestinian people in Gaza and the West Bank has become completely normalized as background noise that no one really cares much about anymore. This is the central effect of the ceasefire.\n\nAnd it’s very similar to the situation with the climate, that there is this general structural, systemic mode of denial where we walk into it with our eyes wide open and at the same time totally closed.\n\nAnd the normalization of these two analogous, or maybe even homologous, catastrophes, I think, is now coming in the shape of this start-up that you might have heard of called Stardust Solutions. It’s a direct offshoot of the military technological industry in the State of Israel that is developing a technological solution for solar radiation management, which this company is very actively promoting and lobbying for in the US Congress. And in the latest reports they claim that they will have this technological solution ready for deployment in 2030.\n\nMany of us who have worked on climate politics for some time have had this feeling that geoengineering is a very likely outcome. It feels almost inevitable, because it looks so easy to do, relatively speaking, compared to abolishing fossil capital. Geoengineering goes perfectly along with the class interests of the most reactionary factions of the capitalist class.\n\nAnd just the other day, Elon Musk tweeted that he wants to combine solar radiation management with some kind of AI robot. So you will have AI technology in charge of running SRM in the stratosphere.\n\nThe void, the absence of any major pushback against this drift into solar geoengineering is extremely disconcerting.\n\nSo far, with very few exceptions—and maybe the main one is Colombia, and we can get back to that—it’s extremely difficult to see the ongoing climate suffering in the Global South developing into a climate subjectivity, as in, people rising up against fossil capital. It’s just not happening. And I wish that we could bet on it starting to happen at some point. You know, “If only things get bad enough, then people will wake up.” But I don’t think we can count on it.\n\nTR: I don’t disagree with anything you said, but I want to restate my question, as to whether we can view the emergence of a climate subjectivity or a climate left that’s more directly, self-consciously identified as such, in the absence of a broader change in left forces or the balance of power.\n\nI think that the task of building a climate movement is part and parcel of the task of building left political power and social power and organized working-class power more broadly.\n\nYou brought in Colombia, and I did want to talk about these politics in Latin America. Because there are few places on Earth where we can see sustained resistance to extraction, including very much oil and gas and coal.\n\nIt’s precisely in Latin America—and the Colombian government is evidence of this—where we’ve seen some of the most vanguard types of resistance and policy initiatives that make declarations, in legal form, like we’re not going to lease any more fossil-fuel projects. That’s the [Gustavo Petro] government’s policy, and they’ve sustained that policy, which is quite impressive given the weight of fossil fuels in their political economy.\n\nBut we could also go to Ecuador, where there have been legal victories in declaring whole swaths of the Amazon off [limits] for extraction, or where you need really rigorous forms of consent of Indigenous communities there in order to move any project forward, in which the rights of nature are being actually protected in some ways.\n\nAnd so, can we imagine a climate left without a more muscular, militant, well-organized left in general, which would necessarily have multiple domains of struggle and conflict? And what do we do about the fact that we see the most progress in resisting extractive projects, including fossil fuels, in ways that are relatively delinked from the climate crisis, at least rhetorically?\n\nAM: Yeah, I would love to continue this conversation because you, unlike me, have a deep knowledge of Latin American environmental politics.\n\nBut let me start with something that you said, namely, should we envision a climate movement that does a lot of other stuff than climate politics, or should we aim for a narrowly defined climate movement? This is a dilemma that what’s left of a movement in Europe has grappled with since the peak of 2018–19. And the general drift has been towards a diversification, but also a fragmentation, of climate activism. And the person who embodies this drift is [Greta Thunberg] herself, who nowadays is almost more like a Palestine activist or a decolonial activist than a climate activist. Her vision of climate politics has been that it’s impossible to distinguish or separate from all these other struggles.\n\nBut then you will meet comrades in the remainders of the climate movement who will say that we’re all on board with this, but the problem is that we feel that we lose our identity as climate activists, and that it becomes unclear to people what the climate movement is and where the climate agenda is, because it gets lost in all these other struggles.\n\nThis is a genuinely difficult dilemma, and I think that one of the things that is so impressive—to jump to a completely different political context, in Colombia—is that Petro has really managed to embed a very explicit climate rhetoric in social environmental struggles in Colombia that have other sources than anger. I don’t think we should underestimate the importance of Petro’s rhetoric throughout these four years that he has been in power, where he’s been very consistent about the climate issue motivating his moratorium on any new fossil fuel installations. Not only has he spread the awareness of the climate issue in Colombian society, as far as I can tell, but it’s also been essential for maintaining some kind of hope in the [global] struggle for a fossil fuel phaseout.\n\nWe’re looking at this conference—the world’s first international conference about phasing out fossil fuels—that I hope people know will take place in Colombia in April. This is together with the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, and it’s a beacon of hope in the dark. And it’s not by chance that this beacon comes from the Global South, and it’s not by chance that it comes from Latin America, because Latin America is the only part of the world where the left retains a capacity to win state power.\n\nAnd this is really the crux of the matter. Everything that’s been achieved in Colombia over the past four years is a function of the fact that the left won executive power and that you have such a unique president as Gustavo Petro in the presidential palace in Bogotá. This makes all the difference.\n\nTR: I want to underscore a couple of things that you said which did provide some interesting answers to my questions.\n\nOne is, it is impossible to imagine concrete, material, and durable climate victories outside of the context of left political power. In the case of Colombia, and despite the current Colombian government not being able to achieve a lot of its goals, I’ve been pleasantly surprised that we’re seeing continued popularity for the project. I think that the project of the political party that’s now formed is becoming more durable than the one leader, which is very important.\n\nThere’s been longer-term processes in Colombia, for example, building popular consciousness even among fossil fuel workers to embrace their own version of a just transition. The Colombian labor movement really stands out for explicitly talking about phasing out their own industries.\n\nSo there’s a longer social process, and the way in which historically there’s also been interesting connections between environmental justice and coal worker agitating in Colombia that has, I think, created a more eco-social imaginary. And I think that gives us insight into the breadth of social forces that are necessary and the multiple terrains of this type of climate struggle.\n\nWS: I want to move to another question, which is, what do you see as the prospects for building a truly mass movement that does have revolution in some form, even if merely the political, as its explicit goal—and that has radical decarbonization and climate justice explicitly as a core pillar? Where do you see the potential for a revolutionary subject in this picture?\n\nAM: This is the big question. I think the moment we’re in is one of permanent catastrophe, in the sense that one disaster after another is being thrown at us. And this is a symptom of the historical defeat of the left. But what that also means is that things are going to break down, and we don’t know when this will create openings for us. The system is so victorious that it keeps destroying everything, but this can eventually at some point curve back on the system itself, so that it becomes self-destructive. At a certain point, the amount of wars and climate disasters and whipped-up tendencies of fascism will create fractures and cracks in the ruling order itself, perhaps.\n\nThis is the original Leninist wager. When you have a system that compulsively generates catastrophe—the original case being the First World War—then the task of the communists is to seize the moment of disaster and transform it into a revolutionary crisis for the system. We don’t know when, or if, the opportunity comes. So being a Bolshevik is lying in ambush. You’re waiting for the right moment, and when it comes, you seize it. This is the fundamental lesson that is still applicable from the Leninist tradition, I think.\n\nBut it also leaves us in a certain kind of blindness, because we can’t really see where the target is or know that it will ever show up.\n\nThe immediate task, then, for climate activists is to be real Leninists, in the sense of saying to people that this is a crisis of the symptoms, but if we don’t want to drown in these symptoms then there’s no other logical possibility than to turn this into a crisis of the driver—the cause—to focus on what is pushing us into this ever increasing spiral of catastrophe. And this is the fossil fuel companies to begin with.\n\nThis is the immediate short-term task—to resurrect something like a climate movement to strike when it’s hot, when actual climate disasters are taking place, and to make the point to people that if you don’t like this, and if you don’t want this future, then what you have to do is go after the drivers and shut them down. We haven’t seen that yet, but it has to happen at some point, otherwise we’re doomed by definition.",

    "description": "Experts reveal the thoughts and behaviors that are secretly making you more stressed.",
    "fullText": "Anxiety is a very normal but a very unwelcome feeling. Most of us would choose not to experience it if we could.\n\nIn some ways, it’s like a smoke alarm, said Natasha Reynolds, a psychotherapist at Bloom Psychology & Wellness in Toronto. That smoke detector alerts you to actual danger and allows you to get out of your home safely, but it also alerts you to things that aren’t actually dangerous, like how a smoke alarm can go off over a piece of burnt toast.\n\nHealth: This Extremely Common Social Habit May Actually Be A Sign Of ADHD\n\nSimilarly, “that threat detection part of our brain... might go off at what it perceives as a threat, but it’s not truly dangerous to us,” Reynolds said.\n\nWhen that smoke alarm goes off frequently to things that aren’t dangerous, it can be a sign to seek support and develop tools to navigate this stress response, Reynolds said. Additionally, common thoughts, behaviors and actions make your anxiety smoke alarm go off more frequently than it should. Here’s what they are:\n\n“A common unhelpful thinking pattern can be called black-and-white thinking, or also known as all-or-nothing thinking,” Reynolds said.\n\nThis kind could mean looking at situations as good or bad and not considering the gray areas, Reynolds explained.\n\nHealth: 4 Ways Therapists Say People With Anxiety Get Stuck — And How To Get Unstuck\n\n“So, for example ... if I made an error in an email, this must mean I’m incompetent, and the other person thinks this too,” she said. In reality, it doesn’t mean you’re incompetent; a mistake means you’re human, and the person on the receiving end thinks this, too (that is, if they even notice the mistake).\n\nThese thoughts can get you down and even make future communications really stressful, causing anxiety to creep in every time you have to email this person or even causing you to stop emailing altogether.\n\nSpeaking of stopping something altogether, therapists say this is another habit that can have a negative effect on you.\n\n“The No. 1 behavior, I believe, that makes anxiety worse is avoidance,” said Jennifer Anders, a Colorado-based psychologist who runs The.Anxiety.Doc Instagram account. “This is actually counterintuitive to what most people believe. Anxiety becomes worse when you avoid the situation, or the place, or the people that trigger your anxiety.”\n\nFamily: The Worst Things People Say When Trying To Be Comforting\n\nJust think about it: If you avoid looking at a credit card balance because of the anxiety it gives you, by the time you do look at that balance, you’ll be riddled with anxiety — and that comes after weeks and weeks of stress looming over you.\n\n“The avoidance fuels that cycle of anxiety, and kind of reinforces that bodily response and exacerbates anxiety over time,” Anders said.\n\nJustine Grosso, a psychologist in North Carolina who also shares mental health insight on her Instagram account, said instead of avoiding a situation, you should incrementally approach it.\n\nWith social anxiety, for example, Grosso said instead of going to a big party, schedule a one-on-one coffee date with a new friend or go to the party for 10 minutes and leave.\n\nHealth: The 1 Thing Therapists Say Harms Your Happiness The Most\n\n“We want to approach things and be willing to tolerate a little bit of discomfort in the service of our values. Meaning, if we value friendship... it’s going to be meaningful for us to approach these social interactions instead of avoid them,” Grosso explained.\n\n“It’s important after we do something that is anxiety provoking, to literally take time, and tell our brain, ‘Hey, we survived this thing, we did this hard thing, and we survived,’” Grosso added.\n\nConstantly asking for other people’s feedback on a situation or even Googling your health symptoms is also contributing to your anxiety, Anders said. These kinds of behaviors are known as seeking reassurance.\n\n“In the short term, the self-reassurance quells that worry feedback loop in your mind, but in the long term, it actually creates this other negative feedback loop that requires reassurance just to feel OK,” Anders said.\n\nHealth: Medical Professionals Say This Is The Absolute Worst Thing You Can Do In The ER\n\nIn other words, reassurance is a quick fix but won’t do any favors for your anxiety in the long term.\n\n“I always encourage people to refrain from doing that as much as possible,” Anders said because it significantly increases anxiety in the long haul for many people.\n\nHave you worried that your anxiety would cause you to faint and you’d receive no help from those around you? Or have you ever mailed your rent check late and assumed this means you’ll be immediately evicted?\n\nThis is known as catastrophizing, which is thinking about the worst-case scenario and believing that this scenario is what’s most likely to occur, according to Reynolds. As you may expect, catastrophizing contributes to anxiety.\n\n“According to cognitive behavioral therapy, they talk about anxiety being a result of us overestimating the situation and then underestimating our ability to cope with that,” Reynolds said.\n\nIt can be helpful to challenge these worst-case-scenario ideas by saying, “What if it all works out?” Reynolds said. “Because anxiety is not thinking of the best-case scenario.”\n\nAdditionally, thinking about the actionable ways you could deal with a bad situation can be useful. “If the worst-case scenario were to play out, what are your strengths in coping with it that we might be underestimating in that moment, as well?” Reynolds said.\n\nIn other words, if you did faint, would no one help you? Could you talk to loved ones about this possibility so they can be prepared to step in? Or if you did mail your rent check late, could you pay a late fee to your landlord?\n\nThe worst-case scenario usually doesn’t happen, but a catastrophizing thought pattern can convince you it will.\n\nIt turns out that telling yourself you’re not good enough or that something isn’t going to work out is more than mean; it’s adding to your anxiety, too, according to Anders.\n\n“This is a huge one that, again, many people are not aware of how they talk to themselves and the words that they use to describe themselves as they go through their daily life and their daily activities,” Anders said.\n\nThese words are often really harsh — way more harsh than how we’d talk to friends or family.\n\n“I really encourage people to pay attention to the words they’re using with themselves, and the first step is not to change it. The first step is to just bring awareness to it,” Anders said.\n\nAccording to Anders, people-pleasing can also fuel your anxiety. Think about it: When you’re constantly putting other people’s needs and opinions above your own, you create some uncomfortable feelings for yourself, including anxiety. What’s more, she added that it makes you feel like you’re neglecting yourself, which can cause anxiety.\n\nAnders said many people, particularly women, are conditioned to put other people’s needs above their own, which makes this a hard habit to break.\n\n“This really creates a dynamic of self-neglect, prioritizing everyone else’s wishes and needs above your own, [and] poor boundaries is something else that this leads to,” Anders said.\n\n“And, really, just developing self-worth that’s contingent on other people, and what you do for other people, that’s a huge, huge one that contributes anxiety,” she noted.\n\nTo combat these behaviors, “grounding skills can be really helpful,” Grosso said. Grounding skills can lower the heart rate and bring on a state of ease that just isn’t there during an anxiety tailspin.\n\nGrounding activities include going for a walk and or doing a workout, Grosso said. Additionally, Grosso said mindfulness skills can help, too. “Like becoming aware of your five senses — taste, touch, sight, smell, sound — and the reason why connecting to our five senses is grounding is because it literally gets us into the present moment,” Grosso said.\n\nAdditionally, Reynolds said she likes to encourage people to do belly breathing, “which is taking deep intentional breaths and as you’re inhaling, you’re extending your belly forward, and as you’re exhaling, you’re bringing your belly in.” This sends more oxygen to the brain and helps bring you a sense of calm, Reynolds said.\n\nIt’s also helpful to name the anxiety-inducing behavior when it’s happening. “The way to be mindful of our thought patterns is to essentially label them when they happen. ‘Oh, there I go, catastrophizing, let me notice that,’” Grosso said.\n\nOr, take a few moments to name the negative self-talk or reassurance-seeking that’s happening, too. “And then shift your focus onto the present moment,” Grosso said.\n\nOver time, you can learn how to distance yourself from these thoughts and become aware of them when they’re happening so you can remind yourself that they aren’t helpful and are, in fact, not reality, either.\n\nBeyond at-home tools for dealing with anxiety, it can also be helpful to seek professional help; anxiety can be more complicated than it lets on.\n\n“Another interesting take on anxiety is that anxiety might actually be a secondary emotion and kind of covering up another emotion that you’re feeling that you deem unacceptable,” Grosso said.\n\nYou may have been raised to think that being angry isn’t acceptable, or you may be harboring grief presenting as anxiety. In other words, there could be larger problems at play, which is where advice from a therapist can help.\n\n“I think psychotherapy is a really powerful experience to just better understand ourselves, understand our emotions and why we do the things we do,” Grosso said.\n\nYou can use databases like Psychology Today and Inclusive Therapists to find therapists near you.\n\nThe 1 Thing Therapists Say Harms Your Happiness The Most\n\nTherapists Say This 1 Easy Hack Can Help With A Panic Attack\n\nGlimmers Are The Opposite Of Triggers.

    "fullText": "California’s East Bay got a shock on the morning of New Year’s Eve when a sleek black Chevrolet Camaro turned a routine patrol on Interstate 580 into something out of a spy movie. At around 8:20 in the morning, officers from the California Highway Patrol spotted a motorist barreling down the highway at speeds well over 100 miles per hour. What happened next has police scratching their heads and asking the public for help identifying the driver and vehicle involved.\n\nFor law enforcement, Interstate 580 can be a daily blur of commuters and big rigs. On this day, though, it was the scene of a high-speed enigma. It’s not a simple case of a Camaro outrunning the officers pursuing it; it also seemed to make its identity vanish. According to the CHP, the vehicle’s license plate went “black” or “turned off” during the chase, depriving authorities of a critical tool used to track down fleeing drivers.\n\nThis odd twist in an otherwise familiar story of speeding and evasion has raised more questions than answers. Social media users wondered if the Camaro was fitted with a so-called digital license plate that can be manipulated remotely.\n\nCalifornia has been at the forefront of experimenting with electronic plates, which are legal when properly registered and used within regulations. Yet the idea that such tech could be exploited to intentionally thwart police tracking naturally grabbed headlines and sparked speculation about potential misuse.\n\nThe CHP’s Dublin area office released a description of the plate itself, noting it was black with yellow or white lettering before it went dark. That limited detail underscores just how little investigators know about the driver or the exact nature of the disappearing tag technology.\n\nLaw enforcement has stopped short of calling it a “hack,” and there’s no indication yet that the plate is illegal in and of itself. But the implication that someone equipped a car with the ability to cloak its identity mid-pursuit is enough to make any patrol vet raise an eyebrow.\n\nTo be clear, this was not a routine stop that turned sour. The Camaro was engaged in what police describe as an extended attempt to flee contact, topping triple-digit speeds as it weaved along the highway. Officials attempted to initiate a traffic stop in the early morning commute, but as so often happens in high-speed chase situations, the driver chose flight over compliance. The report is that the black Camaro is fond of doing over 100 mph.\n\nIn the aftermath, the CHP has appealed directly to the public for tips. Their Facebook post about the incident asked anyone with information to reach out to investigators at the Dublin office. Typically, such pleas signal that law enforcement has not yet identified the suspect or vehicle owner.\n\nIn this case, their language left little doubt that the chase ended with the Camaro slipping out of their grasp. One comment made fun of the authorities, saying, “if you got gapped, you can just say that bro, no shame here.” Most of the comments don’t seem to care:\n\n“Was it a T-top model with a \"screaming chicken\" painted on the hood? Was the diver wearing a cowboy hat and a dark mustache? Oh Camaro... Somehow, I read Trans-AM.”\n\n“I didn’t see nothing, hear nothing, know nothing….”\n\n“Are we on payroll now? They are calling in the Street Detectives.”\n\nIt’s not the first time that high-performance cars have outpaced police vehicles or used unconventional methods to escape. Across the country, high-speed pursuits involving Camaros, Mustangs, and other muscle cars are regular entries in police logs. Some end with arrests, others with crashes.\n\nBut adding technology that directly interferes with standard identification tools marks a new wrinkle, and one that could force legislators and law enforcement agencies to rethink how they monitor and manage such devices.\n\nThe incident also highlights the challenge of pursuing suspects on busy freeways. Officers must balance the need to enforce the law with the safety of other motorists. High-speed chases are inherently dangerous, and when the fleeing vehicle seems to have tools to evade detection, the stakes climb even higher.\n\nAt this point, the Camaro and its driver are still at large. The CHP is seeking help from anyone who witnessed the event or may have seen the vehicle before or after the chase. It remains unclear whether further evidence will surface, but this curious combination of muscle car speed and mysterious plate behavior has already captured the public’s imagination. One of the comments under the FB post was quite lengthy:\n\n“Quit asking the public to do your dirty work… we don’t care… and to be quite honest, the police try to say social media is the best thing that ever happened to law-enforcement because the criminals just snitch on themselves. Well, you guys are letting us know how you do everything … No one knew how you guys did what you did… it is your job to catch us and our job not to get caught. Freedom of speech is crazy, isn’t it?”\n\nIf you saw something that morning on I-580 or know more about the technology that might let a license plate blink out like a cartoon disappearing act, authorities want to hear from you. Anyone with information is urged to contact the CHP Dublin Area Office.",

Less than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said Monday that negative attention and Republican attacks have contributed to an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,\" making it impossible for him to serve full-time as governor while also being a candidate to keep his job.  “Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,\" Walz said at the state capitol.",
    "fullText": "ST PAUL, Minn. (AP) — Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Democrats' 2024 candidate for vice president, is ending his bid for a third term as governor amid President Donald Trump’s relentless focus on a fraud investigation into child care programs in the state.\n\nLess than four months after announcing his reelection campaign, Walz said Monday that negative attention and Republican attacks have contributed to an “extraordinarily difficult year for our state,\" making it impossible for him to serve full-time as governor while also being a candidate to keep his job.\n\n“Every minute that I spend defending my own political interest would be a minute I can’t spend defending the people of Minnesota against the criminals who prey on our generosity and the cynics who want to prey on our differences,\" Walz said at the state capitol. \"So I’ve decided to step out of this race, and I’ll let others worry about the election while I focus on the work that’s in front of me for the next year.”\n\nWalz did not take questions from reporters after speaking for about seven minutes, much of which involved repeating his earlier written statement announcing his decision.\n\n“Donald Trump and his allies — in Washington, in St. Paul, and online — want to make our state a colder, meaner place,” Walz said, referring to the Trump administration withholding funds for the programs and the president's attacks on Somali immigrants in Minnesota. “They want to poison our people against each other by attacking our neighbors. And, ultimately, they want to take away much of what makes Minnesota the best place in America to raise a family.”\n\nDespite the opaque references, Walz did not explicitly acknowledge the impact of a viral video from a right-wing influencer who claimed he'd found rampant fraud at day care centers operated by Somali residents in Minneapolis. But the Trump administration has cited the video in its decision to cut off certain federal funding streams, and the video's creator, Nick Shirley, was happy to take credit for the governor's decision.\n\n“I ENDED TIM WALZ,” Shirley posted Monday on social media.\n\nWalz's exit scrambles the contest in a Democratic-leaning state that Republicans have insisted they can win. Democrats currently hold 24 out of 50 governor's seats nationwide, with 36 seats, including Minnesota's, on the ballot in 2026.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar is considering entering the Minnesota race, according to a person close to her. The person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the senator, who ran for president in 2020, has not made a final decision.\n\nAround a dozen Republicans are already running. They include MyPillow founder and chief executive Mike Lindell, an election denier who is close to Trump. They also include Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, of Cold Spring; Dr. Scott Jensen, a former state senator from Chaska who was the party’s 2022 candidate; state Rep. Kristin Robbins, of Maple Grove; defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor Chris Madel; former executive Kendall Qualls; and former Minnesota GOP Chair David Hann.\n\nA military veteran, union supporter and former high school educator and coach, Walz helped enact an ambitious Democratic agenda for his state, including sweeping protections for abortion rights and generous aid to families.\n\nKamala Harris picked Walz as her running mate in the 2024 presidential election after his attack line against Trump and his running mate, then-Ohio Sen. JD Vance — “These guys are just weird” — spread widely.\n\nWalz continued building his national profile since his and Harris' defeat in November. He was a sharp critic of Trump as he toured early caucus and primary states. In May, he called on Democrats in South Carolina to stand up to the Republican president, saying, “Maybe it’s time for us to be a little meaner.”\n\nThere were partisan reactions to Walz's announcement\n\nReactions to Walz’s decision reflected the intense partisanship certain to spill into the campaign to pick his successor.\n\nDemocratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, who led Minnesota Democrats when Walz was first elected governor in 2018, said Walz “entered public life for the right reasons and never lost sight of them.\" Walz's guiding principle, Martin added, “has always been showing up and doing the work that actually makes their lives better.”\n\nKlobuchar, posting on X, praised Walz as “a true public servant” who made a “difficult decision” but said nothing about her own pending choice.\n\nAnother Minnesotan of national prominence, Republican House Majority Whip Tom Emmer was more succinct, issuing a statement that said in its entirety: “Good riddance.”\n\nDemocratic Governors Association Chair Andy Beshear, the second-term Kentucky governor, praised Walz as a “a national leader in fighting for the middle class” and said his organization “remains very confident Minnesotans will elect another strong Democratic governor this November.”\n\nAt the Republican Governors Association, spokeswoman Courtney Alexander blasted Walz for “failed leadership” and argued that the eventual Democratic nominee “will need to defend years of mismanagement and misplaced priorities.”\n\nWalz, for his part, stood by his administration's stewardship.\n\n“We should be concerned about fraud in our state government,” he said, adding that “a single taxpayer dollar wasted on fraud should be intolerable.” But Walz said his administration has worked diligently to address fraud and manage the state’s operations.\n\nA look at Walz's time as governor\n\nThrough nearly two terms as governor, Walz navigated a closely divided legislature. In his first term, he served alongside a Democratic-led House and Republican-controlled Senate that resisted his proposals to use higher taxes to boost money for schools, health care and roads. But he helped broker compromises.\n\nHe used the office’s emergency power during the COVID-19 pandemic to shutter businesses and close schools, prompting Republican pushback.\n\nRepublicans also were critical of Walz over what they saw as his slow response to sometimes violent unrest that followed the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, by a white Minneapolis police officer in 2020. Walz pleaded for calm after Floyd's death but also stood out as a white political leader who expressed empathy toward Black Americans and their experiences with police violence.\n\nIn his second term, Walz worked with Democratic majorities in both legislative chambers to chart a more liberal course in state government, aided by a huge budget surplus. Minnesota eliminated nearly all of the state abortion restrictions enacted in the past by Republicans, protected gender-affirming care for transgender youth and legalized the recreational use of marijuana. Walz and his fellow Democrats also enacted free school meals for all students and a paid family and medical leave program that went live on Jan. 1.\n\nThat record, combined with Walz’s rural background and experience representing southern Minnesota in Congress, landed him on Harris’ radar as she considered potential running mates in 2024 after replacing Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. After a whirlwind search, she opted for Walz over other candidates including North Carolina’s Roy Cooper, Kentucky’s Andy Beshear, Pennsylvania’s Josh Shapiro and former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.\n\nWalz got a warm welcome from Democratic voters but drew mixed reviews for his lone debate against Vance.\n\nMore recently, Walz has been frustrated in his efforts to enact new gun control measures following a mass shooting last August at Annunciation School in Minneapolis, which left two children dead and injured dozens. He had hoped to call a special session to consider a list of gun safety proposals.",

    "fullText": "MEXICO CITY (AP) — As uncertainty simmers in Venezuela, interim President Delcy Rodríguez has taken the place of her ally President Nicolás Maduro, captured by the United States in a nighttime military operation, and offered “to collaborate” with the Trump administration in what could be a seismic shift in relations between the adversary governments.\n\nRodríguez served as Maduro's vice president since 2018, overseeing much of Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy and its feared intelligence service, and was next in the presidential line of succession.\n\nShe's part of a band of senior officials in Maduro's administration that now appears to control Venezuela, even as U.S. President Donald Trump and other officials say they will pressure the government to fall in line with its vision for the oil-rich nation.\n\nOn Saturday, Venezuela’s high court ordered her to assume the role of interim president, and the leader was backed by Venezuela’s military.\n\nRodríguez, a 56-year-old lawyer and politician has had a lengthy career representing the revolution started by the late Hugo Chávez on the world stage. It's been unclear if the leader would warm up to the Trump administration or follow the same adversarial line as her predecessor.\n\nHer rise to become interim leader of the South American country came as a surprise on Saturday morning, when Trump announced that Secretary of State Marco Rubio had been in communication with Rodríguez and that the Venezuelan leader was “gracious” and would work with the American government. Rubio said Rodríguez was someone the administration could work with, unlike Maduro.\n\nBut in a televised address, Rodríguez gave no indication that she would cooperate with Trump, referring to his government as “extremists\" and maintaining that Maduro was Venezuela's rightful leader.\n\n“What is being done to Venezuela is an atrocity that violates international law,” Rodríguez said, surrounded by high-ranking civilian officials and military leaders.\n\nTrump warned on Sunday, if Rodríguez didn't fall in line, “she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.” He added that he wanted her to provide “total access,” from oil facilities to basic infrastructure like roads, so they can be rebuilt.\n\nTrump’s comments also followed Rubio having asserted in TV interviews on Sunday that he didn’t see Rodríguez and her government as “legitimate” because he said the country never held free and fair elections.\n\nOn Sunday, in statements posted to her Instagram, she took a major shift in tone in a conciliatory message where she said she hoped to build “respectful relations” with Trump.\n\n“We invite the US government to collaborate with us on an agenda of cooperation oriented towards shared development within the framework of international law to strengthen lasting community coexistence,” she wrote.\n\nA lawyer educated in Britain and France, the interim president and her brother, Jorge Rodríguez, head of the Maduro-controlled National Assembly, have sterling leftist credentials born from tragedy. Their father was a socialist leader who was arrested for his involvement in the kidnapping of American business owner William Niehous in 1976, and later died in police custody.\n\nUnlike many in Maduro’s inner circle, the Rodríguez siblings have avoided criminal indictment in the U.S., though the interim president did face U.S. sanctions during Trump's first term for her role in undermining Venezuelan democracy.\n\nRodríguez held a number of lower-level positions under Chávez's government, but gained prominence working under Maduro to the point of being seen as his successor. She served the economic minister, foreign affairs minister, petroleum minister and others help stabilize Venezuela's endemically crisis-stricken economy after years of rampant inflation and turmoil.\n\nRodríguez developed strong ties with Republicans in the oil industry and on Wall Street who balked at the notion of U.S.-led regime change. The interim president also presided over an assembly promoted by Maduro in response to street protests in 2017 meant to neutralize the opposition-majority legislature.\n\nShe enjoys a close relationship with the military, which has long acted as the arbiter of political disputes in Venezuela, said Ronal Rodríguez, a spokesperson for the Venezuela Observatory of Rosario University in Bogota, Colombia.\n\n“She has a very particular relationship with power,” he said. “She has developed very strong ties with elements of the armed forces and has managed to establish lines of dialogue with them, largely on a transactional basis.”\n\nIt's unclear how long Rodríguez will hold power, or how closely she will work with the Trump administration.\n\nGeoff Ramsey, a senior nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council, a Washington research institute, said Rodríguez's initially firm tone with the Trump administration may have been an attempt to “save face.” Others have noted that Maduro's capture required some level of collaboration within the Venezuelan government.\n\n“She can’t exactly expect to score points with her revolutionary peers if she presents herself as a patsy for U.S. interests,\" Ramsey said.\n\nVenezuela’s constitution requires an election within 30 days whenever the president becomes “permanently unavailable” to serve. Reasons listed include death, resignation, removal from office or “abandonment” of duties as declared by the National Assembly.\n\nThat electoral timeline was rigorously followed when Maduro’s predecessor, Chavez, died of cancer in 2013. However, the loyalist Supreme Court, in its decision Saturday, cited another provision of the charter in declaring Maduro’s absence a “temporary” one.\n\nIn such a scenario, there is no election requirement. Instead, the vice president, an unelected position, takes over for up to 90 days — a period that can be extended to six months with a vote of the National Assembly.\n\nIn handing temporary power to Rodríguez, the Supreme Court made no mention of the 180-day time limit, leading some to speculate she could try to remain in power even longer as she seeks to unite the disparate factions of the ruling socialist party while shielding it from what would certainly be a stiff electoral challenge.\n\n—— Janetsky reported from Mexico City and Debre reported from Buenos Aires, Argentina.

    "fullText": "Hurricanes leave devastation in their wake, and at least one insurance company has gone broke rather than try to pay the homeowners insurance claims that it owes, according to Grist and Verite News.\n\nFedNat Insurance Co. looked good on paper, but it wasn't prepared for Hurricane Ida. It was one of seven insurance companies in Florida and 11 in Louisiana that went bankrupt in 2021 or 2022 following a number of natural disasters.\n\nThat resulted in people living in homes that had been destroyed because they couldn't get the claim money they were owed. One family had to gut their living room after the storm, only to never receive the money they needed to put it back together again. Jennifer Bye, the owner of that home, told Grist: \"How do you do that to people? How do you insure people in the South, take all of these premiums, and then just belly-up?\"\n\nInsurance costs are going up, and companies are going out of business for a lot of reasons, including the fact that climates around the world are shifting. The United Nations has noted that burning fossil fuels such as oil, coal, and gas is a major contributor to this problem. Other causes include cutting down too many trees and consuming too many goods.\n\nPer the New York University School of Global Public Health, these shifts are connected to worse storms and other natural disasters, including wildfires and hurricanes. So, rising insurance costs are one result of the changing climate. Insurance companies are also leaving disaster-prone areas and dropping the types of coverage those homeowners need the most.\n\nThe Byes are still waiting on more recovery money after they hired lawyers and filed a lawsuit, according to Grist, though if and when they will get it is up in the air. Some states are developing laws to better deal with situations like this one so families aren't left high and dry after a disaster they couldn't control but did prepare for via insurance.\n\nAs individuals, learning more about the climate and how it's changing can help us understand our own situations and advocate for the people around us.\n\nDo you have a backup power system at your home?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "No deal has yet been agreed for Tyson Fury's return to boxing in 2026, BBC Sport understands.\n\nThe former heavyweight world champion announced on Sunday that he intends to be back in action this year, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch.\n\nFury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Been away for a while but I'm back now.\"\n\nHowever, sources close to the Morecambe fighter have told BBC Sport that the Instagram post was premature, with key details around his comeback - including his opponent and timetable - still to be finalised.\n\nAny comeback - and a potential fight with Anthony Joshua - may also depend heavily on financial backing and the continued involvement of Saudi Arabia in staging major heavyweight events.\n\nSaudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had previously been linked with plans for Fury and long-time rival Joshua to take separate bouts early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua's immediate future remains unclear after he was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nEven if he does return to the ring, significant obstacles remain to finalising any bout with Fury.\n\nSaudi Arabia, through the Riyadh Season banner, has become a major force in boxing in recent years, with both Fury and Joshua having fought on cards backed by the Kingdom.\n\nBritish rivals Chris Eubank Jr and Conor Benn also signed directly with Riyadh Season for their two most recent bouts rather than with individual promoters.\n\nBut the scale of Saudi involvement in future events is now less clear and, without that financial backing, a Fury–Joshua showdown remains difficult to make.\n\nDespite years of discussion, no other promotional group has yet been able to broker an agreement between the pair.",

    "description": "The oral medication serves as an alternative to the injectable version.",
    "fullText": "Americans now have access to the pill form of weight loss medication Wegovy, Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk announced on Monday.\n\nThe oral GLP-1 weight loss medication for adults used to treat obesity was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in December. It’s the first and only FDA-approved oral pill that serves as an alternative to the injectable versions of Wegovy and Ozempic, both of which contain the active ingredient semaglutide.\n\nNovo Nordisk says the pill version is cheaper to produce and doesn’t require refrigeration compared with its weekly injection version, making the drug more accessible, convenient and an alternative for people who have an aversion to needles.\n\nThe daily oral Wegovy pill, much like the injectable version, is designed to be “used with a reduced calorie diet and increased physical activity for adults with obesity, or with overweight who also have weight-related medical problems, to help them lose weight and keep it off,” according to a Novo Nordisk press release.\n\nThe drugmaker also claims the medication can “reduce the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) such as death, heart attack, or stroke in adults with overweight or obesity and established cardiovascular disease.”\n\nThe pill is an oral semaglutide that acts like a hormone — GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) — that regulates appetite, helping to control how much food you eat. The medication works similarly to the hormone, curbing appetite and, therefore, prompting weight loss.\n\nYou have to take the pill daily, 30 minutes before any other medication, food or coffee, Novo Nordisk says.\n\nNovo Nordisk reports similar weight loss results during clinical trials from people who used the oral medication and the injectables. During phase III of its clinical trials for the pill, patients lost approximately 14% of their body weight in combination with a reduced-calorie diet and exercise. Those who stayed on the treatment lost about 17% of their body weight compared with patients who received a placebo, who lost about 3% of their body weight.\n\nThe Wegovy drugmaker says that the side effects of the oral medication are similar to those observed in clinical trials for the injectable version, which include nausea, diarrhea and vomiting.\n\nThe Wegovy pill is only available in the U.S. with a doctor’s prescription. Patients can pick it up at pharmacies nationwide, such as CVS and Costco, or consumers can have it delivered through select telehealth companies like Ro, LifeMD and Weight Watchers, NovoCare Pharmacy, GoodRx and others, according to the drugmaker.\n\nIf the oral medication is covered by insurance, patients can expect a $25 or less co-pay per month.\n\nIf the oral medication isn’t covered by insurance, the price can vary by dosage and range between $149 and $299, according to Novo Nordisk.\n\nFor comparison, the injectable version of Wegovy can cost around $300 per month without insurance.\n\nA competitor of Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly, is also manufacturing its version of an oral GLP-1 pill, orforglipron. It’s currently under review by the FDA and is also expected to be approved this year for consumer access.",

    "description": "Pete Hegseth announced administrative action against Sen. Mark Kelly, initiating a process that could strip the retired Navy captain of rank and pension.",
    "fullText": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced unprecedented administrative action against Sen. Mark Kelly, accusing the Arizona Democrat of “seditious” conduct and initiating a process that could strip the retired Navy captain of rank and reduce his military pension.\n\nIn a statement posted to X on Monday morning, Hegseth said the Department of Defense had begun retirement grade determination proceedings under 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f) against Kelly, citing public comments in which the senator urged service members to refuse illegal orders.\n\nHegseth also said he issued a formal Letter of Censure that will be placed in Kelly’s permanent military personnel file.\n\nSix weeks ago, Senator Mark Kelly — and five other members of Congress — released a reckless and seditious video that was clearly intended to undermine good order and military discipline. As a retired Navy Captain who is still receiving a military pension, Captain Kelly knows he…\n\n— Secretary of War Pete Hegseth (@SecWar) January 5, 2026\n\nThe dispute centers on a broader and increasingly heated debate between the Pentagon and Democratic lawmakers over the legality of recent U.S. military operations and the role of members of Congress in questioning them. Kelly and other lawmakers have argued that service members must refuse unlawful orders, while Hegseth and his allies contend such messaging undermines military discipline by casting doubt on the legality of duly authorized operations.\n\nKelly, a former Navy fighter pilot who retired at the rank of captain, is currently serving his second term in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHegseth characterized a video released earlier this year by Kelly and five other members of Congress as “reckless and seditious,” accusing the senator of undermining good order and military discipline. The video reminded service members that they have a legal obligation to refuse illegal orders, a principle embedded in U.S. military law and the laws of armed conflict.\n\nThe confrontation follows mounting scrutiny over the legal justification for U.S. military actions in Latin America, including discussions within the administration about removing Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro.\n\nOn Sunday’s This Week, Secretary of State Marco Rubio struggled to identify clear legal authority for such action, drawing criticism from lawmakers who argue that ambiguous or unsupported justifications heighten the risk of unlawful orders being issued or followed.\n\nHegseth asserted that Kelly remains subject to military justice as a retired officer receiving retired pay and accused him of violating Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, provisions covering conduct unbecoming an officer and general misconduct.\n\nThe move is highly unusual. While retired officers technically remain subject to the UCMJ in limited circumstances, the authority is rarely invoked and has not been used to punish post-retirement political speech, particularly by a sitting member of Congress.\n\nRetirement grade determinations are typically limited to misconduct committed while an officer is on active duty.\n\nHegseth warned that Kelly’s status as a U.S. senator does not exempt him from accountability and suggested further action could follow.\n\nKelly has not yet publicly responded. The announcement is likely to prompt legal challenges and congressional scrutiny, placing the Pentagon at the center of a constitutional dispute over military authority, civilian oversight, and protected political speech.\n\nThe post Pete Hegseth Strips Sen. Mark Kelly of Military Rank Over ‘Illegal Orders’ Video first appeared on Mediaite.",

The suggestion we have in some way contributed to the adjournment by non-compliance is wholly without merit.\"\n\nThe coroner added that court procedures and the need to make redactions to documents had contributed to the delay.",

I cannot express properly in words how good we have been treated.\"\n\nThe Browns confirmed Andrew Berry, who was hired in 2020 alongside Stefanski, will remain as general manager.\n\nStefanski is the second NFL head coach to be fired following the end of the season after the Atlanta Falcons dismissed Raheem Morris and general manager Terry Fontenot on Sunday night.\n\nThe Falcons went back-to-back seasons with an 8-9 record under Morris, who joined in 2024, and failed to reach the play-offs during Fontenot's five-year stint.",

    "fullText": "Vice President JD Vance asked media outlets on Monday not to share photos of his Cincinnati home after an attacker allegedly broke some of its windows, saying he wanted to shield his children from “the realities of this life of public service.“\n\nVance confirmed he wasn’t home during the overnight attack. Police arrested William DeFoor, 26, on Monday in connection with the incident, according to WLWT. The Secret Service told TheWrap that a person was allegedly “causing property damage, including breaking windows on the exterior of a personal residence associated with the Vice President.”\n\nThe attack happened shortly after midnight, a spokesperson said. The agency is currently coordinating with Cincinnati police and the local U.S. Attorney’s Office.\n\n“I appreciate everyone’s well wishes about the attack at our home,” Vance wrote in an X post on Monday. “As far as I can tell, a crazy person tried to break in by hammering the windows. I’m grateful to the secret service and the Cincinnati police for responding quickly.”\n\nSome local media outlets included photos of the home with holes in its windows, which Vance asked reporters to refrain from doing as the investigation continued.\n\n“One request to the media: we try to protect our kids as much as possible from the realities of this life of public service,” he said. “In that light, I am skeptical of the news value of plastering images of our home with holes in the windows.”\n\nThe incident is the latest in a string of alleged acts of political violence, including assassination attempts on President Donald Trump during his 2024 campaign, arson at Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro’s home last year, the killing of a state lawmaker in Minnesota and the assassination of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.\n\nThe post JD Vance Asks Media to Refrain From Sharing Photos After Attempted Break-In at Ohio Home appeared first on TheWrap.",

    "description": "End-of-life care includes plenty of laughter, says hospice nurse Kath Murray.",
    "fullText": "Hospice care isn't something that should warrant fear — or sadness. When Kath Murray tells people what she does for a living, there's always an awkward silence, a sympathetic head tilt and the inevitable response of \"that must be so hard.\"\n\n\"There's never been a job where I've had so much laughter,\" says Murray, a hospice nurse and palliative care educator based in British Columbia. \"The reality is incredible.\"\n\nIt's not what most of us picture, and that's precisely the problem.\n\nMurray founded Life and Death Matters in 2005 to help health care workers who work with the dying. The organization has grown to include resources for nursing students, long-term care facility employees and families to help them navigate caring for people who are dying.\n\nAccording to Murray, there's one major misconception that stops families from accessing care when they need it most: People think hospice means giving up.\n\n\"That's the biggest myth,\" Murray says. \"But we're actually good at holding hope and reality at the same time.\" Hospice is all about living better, rather than giving up on it entirely.\n\nMany people often think of palliative care and hospice care as the same thing. Palliative care can begin at diagnosis and works in conjunction with curative treatments, symptom management and improves quality of life.\n\nHospice care is reserved for people with a terminal illness who typically have six months or less to live. It provides comprehensive comfort care for both the patient and their family.\n\nBoth types of care are designed to help you live better, not worse.\n\nMurray's close proximity to people who are dying has allowed her to witness and learn from people who are facing and accepting their mortality.\n\n\"I've learned from people who've had time to think about what really mattered in their lives. It was never about fancy cars or designer labels,\" she says. The work has taught her something unexpected: Deep gratitude for everyday things. \"I remember leaving work on a rainy day and feeling so grateful just to have arms and legs that work.\"\n\nMost families start considering hospice when everyday life becomes a struggle. Perhaps someone can't shower or cook meals on their own. In some cases, their health has become unpredictable, with good days followed by scary emergency room visits.\n\nAt other times, it's clear that more support is needed at home than the family can provide. Physical decline makes it apparent that something needs to change.\n\n\"It's never too early for these conversations,\" Murray says. \"And it's not just cancer: We help with heart disease, COPD, dementia, diabetes.\"\n\nUnfortunately, access to hospice services varies across Canada, depending on where you live and the level of provincial funding. Most hospice facilities rely on volunteers to offset the costs of providing care to those in need.\n\nI had a patient tell me, 'It's not being dead that scares me … it's the dying part'\n\nThere can be some uneasiness when patients enter hospice. Moreover, many people fear that it will be a painful process.\n\n\"I had a patient tell me, 'It's not being dead that scares me … it's the dying part,'\" Murray remembers.\n\nMany hospice health care providers can help manage pain and discomfort with medication, but there's also an added element of emotional pain.\n\nDeath doesn't look like it does in the movies, but hospice teams often include counsellors to help patients and families understand the dying process and help prepare them for what's ahead. Murray says only a small percentage of people will enter into hospice and experience a steady decline in health until they die; the rest will experience what she calls \"the roller coaster.\"\n\n\"Families gather to say goodbye, and suddenly the person perks up and says, 'I'm not going anywhere,'\" Murray explains, adding that it can be emotionally exhausting for families.\n\nPeople often wonder how they can support families with a loved one in hospice. Death can be an uncomfortable topic, especially for people who have yet to experience a significant loss. While asking \"what can I do to help?\" may be well-intentioned, it doesn't alleviate any of the stress or pain they may be experiencing.\n\nInstead of asking a vague question, try specifying how you can help. Some examples include:\n\n\"I'm bringing dinner on Tuesday.\"\n\n\"Can I pick up groceries this week?\"\n\n\"I'm free to drive kids to school.\"\n\n\"Here's what I can do … what would help most?\"\n\nThese statements and questions help solve problems without creating more work for your friend or loved one.\n\nWhen you visit someone who's seriously ill, words matter more than you think. Phrases that are meant to be comforting can actually make things more complicated. Instead of saying things like:\n\n\"Everything happens for a reason.\"\n\n\"They're in a better place now.\"\n\nYou can be supportive by doing things like:\n\nAsk what they want to talk about\n\nSome days they want to talk about their illness, other days they want to discuss anything but that.\n\n\"The most important thing? Follow their lead,\" Murray says. \"Some days they want to talk about their illness, other days they want to discuss anything but that.\"\n\nHospice care isn't about giving up hope. It's about making the most of the time you have with dignity, support and with your family.\n\nIt's about focusing on what matters most when time becomes precious. It's about having honest conversations, creating meaningful moments and sometimes finding more laughter and joy than anyone expects.\n\nThe goal isn't to hasten death or abandon all treatment. It's about living as fully as possible while facing reality with courage and the right kind of support.\n\nLet us know what you think by emailing us or threading us @yahoocanada.",

    "fullText": "The enduring image of Ruben Amorim's 14-month tenure at Manchester United may well be the one of him cowering in the dugout at Grimsby.\n\nIt came during an August trip to the seaside for a Carabao Cup match that went horribly wrong for United - an embarrassing 12-11 defeat on penalties the first time in the club's history they had been beaten by a team in the fourth tier.\n\nAmorim's post-match comments smacked of someone who was about to admit the job was too much for him, only to climb down a couple of days later when he said emotions frequently get the better of him and had led him to saying unwise things in public.\n\nHe wasn't going to stop, though. As with many aspects of his personality, once Amorim is on a set course, he will not change. It is something that would contribute to his downfall.\n\nOne critic close to the dressing room said privately that while Amorim was enthralling when he spoke to the media, it was all he was actually good at. A damning assessment, but harsh too.\n\nAmorim's last match was a 1-1 draw with Leeds - a result that leaves them a credible sixth in the Premier League, but one sandwiched by headline-grabbing comments made to journalists.\n\nHis first interaction with the media on Friday included a thinly disguised admission there were splits behind the scenes. After the game, he launched his final broadside in his last answer, which included the statement he \"would not quit\".\n\nThat, effectively, meant United had to either back Amorim or sack him.\n\nWith his tactics an ongoing concern and the hierarchy already distinctly unimpressed by his brutal dismissal of academy players - as well as criticism of senior members of the squad - they were always likely to choose the second option.\n\nAs the fallout continues, BBC Sport goes inside Amorim's reign as Manchester United head coach - not manager - and tries to explain how we got here.",

The TTP is separate from Afghanistan’s Taliban, which has governed the country since 2021 and says it does not allow its territory to be used for attacks against other countries.\n\nTensions between Pakistan and Afghanistan have persisted since early October when Pakistan carried out airstrikes on what it described as Pakistani Taliban hideouts inside Afghanistan, killing dozens of alleged insurgents.\n\nAfghan forces retaliated by targeting Pakistani military posts and claimed to have killed 58 soldiers.

    "fullText": "Rosen, who led Sega from the 1960s into the 90s and who died on Christmas Day, was a hugely important figure in the history of arcade and home gaming\n\nIt is difficult to think of a more influential figure in the arcade game industry than David Rosen, who has died aged 95. The co-founder of Sega, who remained a director of the company until 1996, was instrumental in the birth and rise of the video game business in Japan, and in the 1980s and 90s oversaw the establishment of Sega of America and the huge success of the Mega Drive console.\n\nAs a US Air Force pilot during the Korean war, Rosen found himself stationed in Japan, and once the conflict was over, he stayed on, intrigued by the country and seeing possibilities in its recovering economy. In 1954 he set up Rosen Enterprises and noticing that Japanese civilians now required an increasing number of new ID cards he started importing photo booths from the US to answer the demand. From here he expanded to pinball tables and other coin-operated machines, importing them for installation in shops, restaurants and cinemas. In 1965, he merged the company with another importer, Nihon Goraku Bussan, whose coin-op business Service Games was shortened to Sega for the new venture.\n\nFor the next 15 years, Sega innovated in the arcade sector, switching from importing games to designing its own, and moving on from jukeboxes and pinball tables to electromechanical arcade games such as the submarine shooting sim Periscope and, in 1972, Killer Shark, a shark hunting game which would briefly feature in Jaws. Sega also began to set up its own arcades allowing the company close control over every facet of its business.\n\nOne of Rosen’s great skills was in finding and employing people who instinctively understood where games were heading. In 1979, he spotted rising industry star Hayao Nakayama, director of Esco Trading, another arcade company. As Rosen explained to me in 2013: “Nakayama was very active as a distributor at the time – he was someone I felt was very astute and was quick to adapt to what was happening in the industry, and I wanted him – we did it via an acquisition of his company. By assimilation, we had him and the staff join us.” Nakayama would go on to be the president of Sega Japan during its heyday from 1983 to 1998.\n\nDuring this time, Sega rose from a competitor alongside fellow arcade manufacturers Namco, Capcom, Taito and Konami, to an industry leader. Its sleek, stylish coin-ops of the 1980s – Outrun, Space Harrier and AfterBurner – changed the image of arcades from nerdy hideouts to cool aspirational hangouts, while 1990s titles Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter established the company as a technological powerhouse.\n\nFrom the late-1970s, Rosen pursued a new market: home TV games. He encounter a major rival, Nintendo, which dominated with its Color TV-Game console, and later the Nintendo Entertainment System. When Rosen returned to the US in the early 1980s, he was determined to take a slice of the global console industry from his Kyoto-based competitor. “Nintendo was responsible for the revival of the home console market after the Atari collapse of 1983,” he told me. “We wanted to see if we could make a device that would be competitive. Unfortunately our first attempt failed to compete. It was just made up of off the shelf parts, it wasn’t until 1986 that we brought out the Master System …”\n\nThis machine would struggle in the US but was huge in Europe and South America, and Rosen spotted a niche. While Nintendo was all about family entertainment, the titles doing well on the Master System were teen-focused brawlers, such as Golden Axe and Shinobi. When it came to release the new Sega Mega Drive console in Japan in 1988, Rosen insisted on changing its name to Genesis for the US launch, emphasising a new beginning and a more mature outlook. He also brought in Michael Katz an experienced exec from Mattel and early console company Coleco.\n\n“We were up against the wall in terms of time,” he said. “I had known Michael from some of the other endeavours he was involved in, he had all this experience from Coleco and he certainly knew the players. I thought he could help launch the product and at the same time bring structure to the company, which he did.” Spurred on by Rosen’s vision, Katz marketed the Genesis as a games console for teenagers, not children, using TV ads which combined video game visuals with flashing images and rock music and the immortal phrase: Genesis does what Nintendon’t. When Tom Kalinske took over as CEO Sega of America in 1990, he oversaw a new series of equally famous ads which almost always ended with someone screaming “Sega!”\n\nRosen would stay active in the company in various senior roles until retiring in 1996. Although Sega’s home console business would falter in this period due to the rise of the Sony PlayStation, the company’s arcade supremacy remained for the rest of the decade. I spoke to him in 2013 while writing the book Sega Mega Drive Collected Works. As a lifelong Sega fan, my hour-long chat with him that day was a career highlight. He talked fondly about his time in Japan, the people he worked with and his journey through the industry. He told me with considerable glee that while out and about in his home town of Los Angeles, strangers would still shout ‘Sega!” at him when passing on the street.",

    "fullText": "These inventions trigger rage, but also optimism. Maybe they will make people think more critically about debate and democracy\n\nIt was my blue shirt, a present from my sister-in-law, that gave it all away. It made me think of Yakov Petrovich Golyadkin, the lowly bureaucrat in Fyodor Dostoevsky’s novella The Double, a disconcerting study of the fragmented self within a vast, impersonal feudal system.\n\nIt all started with a message from an esteemed colleague congratulating me on a video talk on some geopolitical theme. When I clicked on the attached YouTube link to recall what I had said, I began to worry that my memory is not what it used to be. When did I record said video? A couple of minutes in, I knew there was something wrong. Not because I found fault in what I was saying, but because I realised that the video showed me sitting at my Athens office desk wearing that blue shirt, which had never left my island home. It was, as it turned out, a video featuring some deepfake AI doppelganger of me.\n\nSince then, hundreds of such videos, bearing my face and synthesising my voice, have proliferated across YouTube and social media. Even this weekend, there has been another crop, depicting a deepfaked me saying fictitious things about the coup in Venezuela. They lecture, they say things I might have said, sometimes intermingled with things I would never say. They rage, they pontificate. Some are crude, others unsettlingly persuasive. Supporters send them to me, asking: “Yanis, did you really say that?” Opponents circulate them as proof of my idiocy. Far worse, some argue that my doppelgangers are more articulate and cogent than me. And so I find myself in the bizarre position of being a spectator to my own digital puppetry, a phantom in a technofeudal machine I have long argued is not merely broken, but engineered to disempower.\n\nMy initial reaction was to write to Google, Meta and the rest to demand that they take down these videos. Several forms were filled in anger before, a week or more later, some of these channels and videos were taken down, only to reappear instantly under different guises. Within days I had given up: whatever I did, however many hours I spent every day trying my luck at having big tech take down my AI doppelgangers, many more would grow back, Hydra-like.\n\nSoon, rage gave way to contemplation. Was I not, after all, the one who argued that big tech did not merely digitise capitalism but in fact spearheaded a great transformation, turning markets into cloud fiefs and profit into cloud rents? Are my AI doppelgangers not the perfect confirmation that, in this technofeudal reality, the liberal individual is dead and buried?\n\nAcquiescing to the partial loss of self-ownership, I sought solace in the rationalisation of these deepfakes as the ultimate act of feudal enclosure, proof that under technofeudalism we own nothing – not our labour’s data output, not our social graphs and now not even our audiovisual identity. Our new lords see us as tenants on their cloud lands, androids whose likeness they can appropriate at will to sow confusion, to muddy discourse, to drown genuine dissent in a cacophony of synthetic noise created for this purpose.\n\nBut then a sunnier thought hit me, one that harks back to ancient Athens. What if my AI doppelgangers were harbingers of isegoria (ἰσηγορία), a principle as bright, promising and absent as genuine democracy itself? When I asked several versions of AI chatbots to define it, they all dutifully misrepresented its meaning, defining isegoria as equality of speech, or the right to be heard, or the freedom to address the assembly. But that’s not what the Athenians meant with the word. In fact, to them isegoria meant the exact opposite of today’s “free speech”, which they would dismiss as the abstract right to shout into the void. To the Athenians, it meant the right to have your views judged seriously, on their merits, independently of who you are or indeed how well you phrase them.\n\nMight AI deepfakes salvage isegoria from the clutches of our technofeudal dystopia? When we realise that it is impossible to verify who is speaking in a YouTube video, might we be forced to judge the merits of what is being said, rather than who is saying it? In the process of debasing authenticity, could big tech have inadvertently given isegoria a chance? These questions offered a glimmer of hope.\n\nIt was the hope that the spectre of democracy may still be hovering over our heads if only we can find the motivation to look up, to engage in the slow, difficult, democratic labour that the algorithmic feed was designed to obliterate: critical evaluation of views and arguments thrown at us. Alas, this hope, though tangible, is insufficient as long as our technofeudal lords retain two colossal, asymmetrical advantages.\n\nFirst, they own the agora itself – the servers, the feeds, the algorithmic means of communication. They can anoint their own speech as authentic with digital seals while drowning ours in a quagmire of doubt and noise. The result? Not isegoria, but a digital divine right where truth is the patented property of power.\n\nSecond, and more cunningly, they need no deepfakes to rule. Their ideology is embedded in the machine: the power to extract surplus value from proletarians connected to the cloud through various digital devices, the logic of extracting cloud rents from vassal capitalists on their platforms, the tyranny of shareholder value, their imminent success at privatising money.\n\nSo our task is not to beg these lords for verification. Our task is political. We must socialise cloud capital, the all-powerful new force transforming society and destroying everything that makes humanism imaginable.\n\nUntil then, let our digital doppelgangers speak. Perhaps they will so saturate the spectacle that we finally stop listening for our voice and start judging the arguments on their own terms. This is perhaps the most paradoxical shard of hope in a hall of mirrors. But in this carnival, we grasp at every fragment we can.\n\nYanis Varoufakis is an economist, politician and author.

    "description": "\"The creeper reemerged, this time riding his bike past my house in broad daylight and then U-turning to look directly into my kitchen window.\"",
    "fullText": "I called my boyfriend and told him what had happened. I didn’t tell him in person because we lived 1,000 miles apart and were rarely in the same room. The incident had involved a man riding his bike with his pants pulled down around his ***, hissing at me, “You want some of this?” It was quite a feat of balance, I thought in the split second before I realized he was a threat, stalking me in the black morning when I was just trying to go for a run. I called the police, who took down a report. My boyfriend said he was sorry it had happened, and we both laughed at my description of the flasher’s pale butt glowing under the streetlight.\n\nWe were nearly a year into our relationship by then, which began not long after I ended my 19-year marriage, when my post-divorce emotions were at their rawest. When we met, I immediately opened up to him about who I was and what I wanted from life and a relationship. I probably should have sworn off men for a while so I could reflect on why my marriage failed, but instead, I was pushing forward.\n\nAlso Read: I Was Certain My Boyfriend Was Keeping A Secret From Me. What I Discovered Online Was Shocking.\n\nI refused to let a creepy stranger dictate when I could leave my house, so I kept running in the dark, but now it was different. Every time I shifted my gaze to avoid tripping, my headlamp cast a hard shadow that looked like the man, ready to pounce. He was everywhere.\n\nWhen my boyfriend came to visit the following weekend, we ran together, and I felt safe again. He was tall and fit and never worried about being stalked. I hated that I felt safer with him just because he was a man while the source of my fear was also a man, how men had on-off power over my sense of security.\n\nAfter my boyfriend flew back home, the creeper reemerged, this time riding his bike past my house in broad daylight and then U-turning to look directly into my kitchen window. I called the police, and they dispatched an officer to search the area.\n\nThat was the first time I got a good look at him: hooded eyes, black hair, skin drawn tight around his jaw. He looked anxious, which was scary, like he wasn’t in control of his own actions. If you saw his mug shot, you might say he looked like a serial killer.\n\nAlso Read: I Never Expected My Mom To Move Into A Retirement Community. I Now Realize She May Have Been Hiding A Devastating Secret.\n\nThe detective assigned to the case told me the man’s name. He had a history of exposing himself to women and lived a few blocks away on my own street, but no one had caught him in the act so they couldn’t arrest him. A woman a few blocks over had nicknamed him the penis pedaler.\n\n“That’s awful,” my boyfriend said on the phone later. “I wish I could be there for you.”\n\n“It’s fine,” I said. “I’ll be fine.” But I was kidding myself.\n\nAs soon as the sun went down, I double-checked every window and door lock. Armed with pepper spray, I looked under beds and inside the bathtub for the man’s lanky, capable body. I shoved a garbage can against the kitchen door so I would hear when he inevitably broke in to rape and kill me. I put the police department’s number on speed dial and tried to sleep.\n\nAlso Read: My Dog Killed My Neighbor's Cat. I Had No Idea How Much My Life Would Change Because Of It.\n\nTwo days later, the flasher rolled up beside me while I walked with a friend. I contacted the police, as I was told to do.\n\nThe detective put a motion-triggered deer cam that worked in the dark on my front porch column. He said the police thought the creeper might have a particular interest in me, which sounded like a weird compliment.\n\nMy best friend suggested I borrow her dog for protection, but I declined. Another asked if I had a restraining order against the man, but that seemed extreme. My boyfriend suggested I get a Peloton, the assumption being that I could lock myself in my house and ride a fake bike going nowhere while the creeper rode his bike freely outside wherever he wanted. I refused.\n\nI told the detective I could run in the early morning as a decoy so they could catch the man in the act, but the police didn’t want to put a civilian in harm’s way. They borrowed the idea and sent out female officers as bait, but the man didn’t take it.\n\nI started running with my phone and pepper spray at all times. I got faster that season. Running out of fear is motivating.\n\nAlso Read: I Always Thought Cheating Was Unforgivable. Then A Friend's Affair Made Me Question Everything.\n\nTwo days after he installed the camera, the detective stopped by. On the tiny screen, he showed me footage from the previous morning of a fuzzy gray ghost on a bike rolling in and out of the frame. Two minutes later, there I was in my tank top, running in the same direction as the man. He had been waiting for me, and I’d had no idea he was there. Then the detective told me that, years before, the man had assaulted a female runner in our city park, dragging and pinning her to the ground.\n\n“That’s awful. Are you running tomorrow morning?” he asked.\n\nAlso Read: After My Baby Died, I Saw 4 Words On A Standard Form At The Doctor's Office That Stopped Me Cold\n\n“Good. But if you do, text me when you leave and when you get back, please,” he said.\n\n“What are you going to do if I don’t text?” I didn’t give him time to answer. “I appreciate it, but it’s not really useful if I tell you when I leave and when I get back. It’s the in-between that’s the issue.”\n\n“I know. Just feeling helpless over here.” I flinched at the notion that he was helpless, ticking through the ways he wasn’t — being a man chief among them.\n\nI’d always been so proud of how fearless I was, but the creeper had broken me. I was pissed off at him and pissed off at the police and pissed off at how women are always expected to accommodate men in the world. I set up a Peloton in my guest room.\n\nWhen the weather turned, the police predicted that the creeper would be less active to avoid literally freezing his *** off. The neighborhood text group reported fewer sightings. I still had some run-ins. He intersected me one afternoon when I was running, parked his bike down the street to watch me rake leaves, and then watched as my kids and I unloaded groceries from our car.\n\nMy boyfriend and I had been dating for about two years when the creeper stuff stopped for good, so I sold the Peloton on Facebook.\n\n“That was sudden,” my boyfriend said when I told him.\n\n“It makes me feel like you might wake up one morning and just get rid of me,” he said.\n\n“I would never do that. At least not on Facebook,” I said.\n\nI thought he was overreacting, but his reaction also made me believe he was helplessly in love with me and that I was in control of the fate of our relationship. He knew that I wanted to be the one pulling the strings of my life, to be able to move freely about the world without arming myself with pepper spray or thinking someone else could hurt me. He knew these things because I’d told him so. For the first time in my life, I felt emotionally secure with a partner.\n\nSix months later, we made plans to live a few miles from each other. I would never have to feel unsafe again. But just as he was feeding me details about packing boxes and moving trucks, and I was planning on him being with me for the holidays, I discovered that he was married. He had lied to me — and his wife — for three years. However real that sense of both emotional and physical security with him had felt, it was a mirage.\n\nA few weeks after I learned the truth about my boyfriend, I saw my flasher neighbor walking past my house hand-in-hand with a wisp of a woman, their foreheads tilted toward each other. The detective had told me the man stayed out of trouble when he had a girlfriend. She made him calmer like my boyfriend had made me feel safer.\n\nI wish my boyfriend had been more like the creeper in some ways. Maybe if he acted like a terrible person, I could have protected myself, locking up my heart so he couldn’t get in. But my boyfriend was an exquisite liar.\n\nHe was much worse than the flasher on the bike. At least that guy was honest about his creepiness. He didn’t present himself as harmless and mentally sound. He was reckless and often only partially clothed — red flag! My boyfriend, on the other hand, was generous and kind. He acted like he respected me and always had my best interests at heart.\n\nFriends assumed I would have trouble trusting other people after my ordeal, but it didn’t work out that way. My awful boyfriend is the person who helped me realize how important emotional security is. He made me want to be able to share myself with another person.\n\nStill, when I started falling for a new guy who seemed kind and unmarried, I felt like I could open up to him about anything, but I knew better than to trust my own judgment. I asked him to produce a copy of his divorce decree before I let things go too far. I ended up marrying the guy, and sometimes we go for runs in the dark.\n\nDo you have a compelling personal story you’d like to see published on HuffPost?

    "fullText": "If 2025 featured a mix of highs and lows in early care and education, 2026 is poised to bring a series of deeper challenges to the field, as states prepare to make difficult budget decisions in anticipation of the looming federal funding cuts.\n\n“It’s pretty grim,” said Natalie Renew, executive director of Home Grown, a national initiative committed to improving the quality of and access to home-based child care, about the outlook for the sector.\n\n“I don’t think anyone is particularly optimistic about child care” in the new year, added Daniel Hains, chief policy and professional advancement officer at the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).\n\nA handful of early care and education experts noted that 2025 did herald in a number of key victories in the field.\n\nSome states have made progress in policies shaping child care and early childhood education. In 2025, Arizona, Connecticut and Montana were among those that made new investments in the field. New Mexico took its gains in recent years a step further by announcing free universal child care for all families, regardless of income, beginning last November.\n\nAlongside those wins for early learners and their caregivers came some challenges. Head Start was caught in political crosshairs more than once throughout the year — first when it was floated for elimination, then when many of its regional offices across the country were closed, and later when programs serving thousands of children nearly lost access to services during the prolonged government shutdown. And some states, such as Indiana, feeling stretched by the end of federal pandemic relief dollars, began to pull back on support for families and programs, slashing provider reimbursement rates, instituting co-pays for families who use subsidies, and changing subsidy eligibility, among other actions.\n\nNow, those experts say, the “child care cliff” that many states have experienced as historic pandemic-era investments expired is going to run headlong into another kind of budget shortfall in 2026. That’s one of four main issues they said they’ll be watching in early care and education in the new year.\n\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act that was signed into law in July 2025 includes significant cuts to Medicaid and SNAP. The cuts effectively shift the costs of those programs from the federal government to states. If states decide to pick up the tab, they’ll likely have to pull back on other services.\n\nMost of the cuts won’t go into effect until after the 2026 midterm elections, but states will start planning ahead.\n\n“It’s less painful to do it slowly than all at once,” explained Melissa Boteach, chief policy officer at ZERO TO THREE.\n\nUnlike the federal government, states can’t spend more than they earn; they have to balance their budgets. So they’ll be looking for ways to increase revenue, such as through new taxes, or cut costs by eliminating or scaling back programs and services.\n\n“Uncertainty is the word,” said Aaron Loewenberg, senior policy analyst at New America. “There’s a lot of anxiety and uncertainty at this point about what the next year or two could look like.”\n\nAs states look to reduce costs, they will have fewer dollars to invest in early care and education. Certainly the prospect of bold new projects and initiatives seems less likely, experts said, but it’s also possible that existing programs could be scaled back.\n\nWhat will emerge, said Hains of NAEYC, is a divide between states that have the will and resources to fund ECE, and states that don’t.\n\n“We’re going to be looking at two very different countries: States that have revenue to invest in child care and early learning — [like] Vermont, New Mexico, Connecticut, Montana — while other states are going to be in more constrained and challenging situations.”\n\nUltimately, funding cuts will be felt by children, families and early educators.\n\n“There’s no way to nickel and dime investing in children,” Boteach said. “At the end of the day, if we’re going to really transform outcomes for children and families, it requires resources. … Children in this country are going to suffer because we are disinvesting rather than investing in their future.”\n\nNew Mexico’s pledge of free, universal child care has buoyed the spirits of many early childhood educators and advocates.\n\n“It’s an enormous bright spot in an otherwise very difficult year,” Boteach said.\n\nThe initiative is in its early days — the income limitation was lifted on Nov. 1, 2025 — so this year will offer state leaders a chance to make good on their promise. Early childhood policy experts will be watching closely.\n\nLoewenberg of New America said he’ll be looking at how leaders navigate challenges in the system, whether families feel it’s successful, and how such a policy could be replicated in states that don’t have the oil and gas revenues that New Mexico uses to fund universal child care.\n\nMeanwhile, all eyes will be on New York City as Mayor Zohran Mamdani settles into his new role and pursues his own pledge for universal child care.\n\n“I’m holding out excitement or negativity to wait and see what happens,” said Loewenberg. “I think we’re past the point of saying, ‘This is great because people are talking about it.’ The difficult work is being able to make it work. That remains to be seen.”\n\nOne critical step is working out the funding mechanism for universal child care, which will likely require cooperation from the state government.\n\nHains does find the policy pledge in itself encouraging.\n\n“Reflecting back on the last decade or two in this work, how amazing is it that we are at a place where mayors and governors are putting forward real, meaningful proposals of child care as a public good that’s available to everybody?” Hains said. “As a whole, looking at the big picture, it’s exciting that child care feels like something that elected officials can deliver on.”\n\nIn 2025, the Trump administration intensified immigration enforcement, which has had deleterious consequences for early childhood educators and, in turn, the families who rely on them.\n\nAn estimated one in five early childhood educators are immigrants. In large urban areas, such as New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, immigrants make up almost half of the child care workforce, Boteach pointed out.\n\nNew America, a left-leaning think tank, released a report in December that found a strong association between the increase in ICE activity and the number of foreign-born child care workers: Between February and July 2025, as ICE arrests increased after President Trump took office, there were 39,000 fewer foreign-born child care workers than the same period in 2024.\n\nWith more funding for immigration enforcement, detention and deportation included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the trend is expected to continue in 2026.\n\n“Immigration enforcement, to me, right now, is the number one disruptor both to parent behavior and provider behavior,” said Renew of Home Grown. “It is hugely disruptive.”\n\nBecause arrests have been public, visible and sometimes physical, they have created a culture of fear among immigrants, even those with legal status in the country, New America found. And now that early learning settings are fair game for ICE activity — prior to Trump’s second term, they were protected under a “sensitive locations” exception — many educators and parents worry about what may unfold before children’s eyes.\n\n“The amount of stress, the amount of worry about targeting in your community, can affect providers’ mental health and then the health of those kids in their care,” Boteach said.\n\nIn effect, the escalation in immigration enforcement may impact both the availability and the quality of early care and education, she added.\n\nEven in a challenging political and budgetary environment, there are bright spots to keep an eye on in 2026.\n\nFor one, Loewenberg pointed out, Head Start is still a viable, funded federal program. A year ago, that was not a sure thing.\n\nA second is that a number of states with protected revenue streams for early care and education, including New Mexico and Vermont, will continue to invest in the field. Others are jumping in to commit more dollars to the sector — New York, Texas and Washington among them.\n\nFinally, early care and education is proving to be a viable campaign issue. In addition to Mamdani’s victory in New York, Mikie Sherrill of New Jersey and Abigail Spanberger of Virginia both won their gubernatorial races by talking about child care.\n\n“You’re seeing in the elections that candidates that ran on child care, ran on helping families and children, won,” Boteach said. “These are winning political issues, which means both parties should be vying to talk about these issues and govern on these issues.”\n\nIndeed, Hains feels that the country is moving from a place of “whether” child care is a government responsibility to “how” and how much the government should be involved.",

    "fullText": "It would’ve been no more than another day in a life of a YouTube famous car dealer in New Jersey. Instead, the events of that day quickly spiraled into a chaotic mix of tense negotiations, customer drama, luxury car wheeling and dealing, and an unexpected call from law enforcement that stunned viewers.\n\nThe video opens inside the buzzing offices of JNS Auto House, where staff members juggle phone calls, trade appraisals, and incoming inventory. Almost immediately, trouble brews. A BMW M5 under consideration sets off alarms after an auto check reveals severe structural damage, unknown tuning, missing catalytic converters, and questionable tires.\n\nThe discovery frustrated the team, who openly criticize deceptive dealer practices and emphasize their commitment to transparency. The car is promptly dismissed, with warnings issued about dishonest sellers being removed from dealer platforms altogether.\n\nFrom there, attention shifts to a live negotiation involving a BMW M4 Competition and a trade-in from a customer calling in from Georgia. The back-and-forth exposes how razor-thin these deals can be. Shipping costs, bad Carfax history, and market values complicate matters, leaving both sides several thousand dollars apart. The conversation remains polite but strained, and when financing enters the discussion, the customer abruptly hangs up on one of the sales managers, Tony.\n\nThat moment becomes a turning point. Dealership owner George takes over and calls the customer back directly, confronting him about the hang-up. The exchange is tense. George makes it clear that disrespect toward his staff is not tolerated, even if the buyer insists on speaking only with him. Despite the friction, the discussion pivots to a far more expensive vehicle, a rare Mercedes-Benz G63 Edition 55 listed at nearly $167,000.\n\nThe customer makes an offer just under the asking price. Internally, the team debates whether to accept. The vehicle has been sitting on the lot, and the market is softening as the year ends. After a flurry of internal calls and animated discussions, the decision is made to sell at $165,000 if the buyer finances. But once again, the customer disappears, reinforcing George’s belief that buyers who refuse to work with the full sales team rarely close deals.\n\nAs if the day was not dramatic enough, the mood abruptly shifts when George receives a call from a Phoenix police investigator. The officer is searching for Brett Holmes; a former short-term employee tied to an ongoing fraud case involving title and vehicle scams.\n\nThe investigator confirms there is an active warrant for Holmes’ arrest and asks for any information that could help locate him. George publicly shares the details with viewers, urging anyone with knowledge of Holmes’ whereabouts to contact the Phoenix Police Department.\n\nWhile that storyline lingers, the dealership presses on. A new customer emerges, offering the same $165,000 for the G63. This time, the buyer is decisive. Within minutes, paperwork is requested, wire instructions are sent, and the deal is officially closed. Cheers erupt across the showroom as the team celebrates the sale, vindicated after hours of uncertainty.\n\nThe video continues with a test drive of a 2025 G63, highlighting subtle improvements in ride quality, tech features, and refinement. A full lot walk follows, showcasing an inventory that reads like a supercar wish list, including McLarens, Porsche Turbo S models, Nissan GT-Rs, Cybertrucks, Lamborghinis, and a GT2 RS held for collection purposes.\n\nThe closing moments bring a personal touch as George’s father appears on camera, offering blunt business wisdom and a humorous take on holiday car buying. His message is simple. If you love your wife, skip the car parts and buy her a G-Class.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Monday announced that he is issuing a letter of censure to Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona over the lawmaker’s participation in a video that called on troops to resist unlawful orders.\n\nHegseth said that the censure was “a necessary process step” to proceedings that could result in a demotion from Kelly's retired rank of captain in the U.S. Navy.\n\nIn a lengthy post on X, Kelly said he “never expected” what he called an “attack” from Trump and Hegseth, recounting his 25 years of Navy service, as well as combat and space missions. Calling Hegseth's move “outrageous” and “un-American,” Kelly said he would fight the censure “with everything I’ve got — not for myself, but to send a message back that Pete Hegseth and Donald Trump don’t get to decide what Americans in this country get to say about their government.”\n\nThe move comes more than a month after Kelly participated in a video with five other Democratic lawmakers in which they called on troops to defy “illegal orders.” President Donald Trump accused the lawmakers of sedition “punishable by DEATH” in a social media post days later.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York called Hegseth’s action against Kelly “a despicable act of political retribution.”\n\n“Mark Kelly is a hero and a patriot committed to serving the American people,” Schumer said on social media. “Pete Hegseth is a lap dog committed to serving one man – Donald Trump.”\n\nIn November, Kelly and the other lawmakers — all veterans of the armed services and intelligence community — called on U.S. military members to uphold the Constitution and defy “illegal orders.”\n\nThe 90-second video was first posted from Sen. Elissa Slotkin’s X account. In it, the six lawmakers — Slotkin, Kelly and Reps. Jason Crow, Chris Deluzio, Maggie Goodlander and Chrissy Houlahan — speak directly to U.S. service members, whom Slotkin acknowledges are “under enormous stress and pressure right now.”\n\nThe Pentagon announced that it began an investigation of Kelly late in November while citing a federal law that allows retired service members to be recalled to active duty on orders of the defense secretary for possible court martial or other measures.\n\nWhile all six lawmakers served in the military or the intelligence community, Hegseth made clear in previous remarks that Kelly was the only one facing investigation because he is the only one of the lawmakers who formally retired from the military and is still under the Pentagon’s jurisdiction.\n\nKelly said that the investigation was part of an effort to silence dissent within the military.\n\n“This is just about sending a message to retired service members, active duty service members, government employees — do not speak out against this president or there will be consequences,” Kelly told reporters in mid-December.\n\nIn his post Monday, Hegseth charged that Kelly's remarks in the video and afterward violated the Uniform Code of Military Justice provisions against conduct unbecoming an officer and violating good order and discipline.\n\nKelly, along with some of the other Democrats in the initial video, have also sent out fundraising messages based off the Republican president’s reaction to their comments, efforts that have gone toward filling their own campaign coffers and further elevating their national-level profiles.\n\nIn recent months, Kelly — whose name has frequently been mentioned as a potential 2028 Democratic presidential contender — has made several trips to South Carolina, traditionally an early primary state that kicked off its party’s nominating calendar in 2024. Appearing with his wife, former Rep. Gabby Giffords, at events calling for stricter gun control measures, Kelly met during those trips with local lawmakers, stakeholders whose early support can be critical as national-level hopefuls attempt to make inroads in the critical state.\n\nHegseth said Monday that “Captain Kelly’s status as a sitting United States Senator does not exempt him from accountability, and further violations could result in further action.\"\n\nTodd Huntley, a retired Navy captain and judge advocate general, said that this is a “novel” situation that raises legal questions.\n\nOne issue, according to Huntley, is whether Kelly’s comments fall under the constitutional protections of the speech or debate clause.\n\nThe clause is intended to protect members of Congress from questioning about official legislative acts, and a 1968 Supreme Court decision wrote that the provision’s intent was “to prevent legislative intimidation by and accountability to the other branches of government.”\n\nHuntley also said that while the type of process Hegseth is using here, known as a retirement grade determination, is fairly routine, “as far as I know, they’ve always been based on conduct during the individual’s active duty service, even if it only came to light after retirement.”\n\n“So, I don’t know if conduct totally after retirement would fit the requirement for such a determination,” he added.\n\nAccording to Hegseth, Kelly now has 30 days to submit a response to the proceedings that will decide if he is demoted. The decision will be made within 45 days, Hegseth’s post added.\n\nKinnard reported from Columbia, S.C. Associated Press writer Stephen Groves contributed to this report.",

    "fullText": "McLaren driver Oscar Piastri has revealed that he, George Russell and Alex Albon held an \"UNO World Championship\" that took place during travel days between some of the races of the 2025 Formula 1 season. Admitting there were \"questionable rules\" between the trio, he opened up on what he did during his downtime.\n\nTalking on F1's Off The Grid with presenter Lawrence Barretto, the Australian explained that a long-haul flight between races turned from an impromptu game of UNO into something larger.\n\n“You're just chatting, you're sleeping. What’s going on?” Barretto asked about the travel time between races when drivers share flights.\n\n“Myself, George Russell and Alex Albon had an UNO World Championship on the way from Baku to Singapore last year,” Piastri laughed. “There was some questionable rule decisions, and rules that I’d never heard of playing UNO before from some of the others, mainly George.\n\n\"Apparently, they were family rules.\"\n\nBarretto asked whether these rules from the Mercedes driver tipped the scales in his favour.\n\n\"Yes, they did,\" he smiled. \"We’re always competitive at everything, all the drivers. It’s always good fun.”\n\nHis competitiveness predates his career in motorsport. Like many, including seven-time champion Lewis Hamilton, he started with RC racing.\n\n\"Been a competitive person since I was really little,\" he said. \"But channelling that into racing and motorsport...Yeah, started with RC cars, won a national championship at nine and then started racing go-karts a year later.\"\n\nPiastri, like a lot of drivers, lives in Monaco.\n\n\"It's convenient when you want to go and play padel or do other things,\" he said on the subject. \"Also makes travelling to the races convenient. Like I'm sure most people have seen, we often travel to races together and stuff on those plane journeys.\"\n\nHe added: “It's pretty cool to come here when the races are done. It's a bit more relaxed when there's no racing.”\n\nAfter a strong start to his career in F1 and a championship contender for 2025, he has suddenly exploded in popularity - something he's still getting to grips with.\n\n“It is still a little bit strange,” he said. “Obviously at the track you expect the attention, but there has been times where you go in the supermarket or whatever, out of nowhere, someone's asking for a photo or an autograph or whatever, or even just asking, 'is that really you?'”\n\nPiastri will be hoping to continue the momentum he's found in his first three seasons into 2026.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "description": "A look at 10 players who have made a difference at this year's world junior hockey championship in Minnesota.",
    "fullText": "While it was a disappointing tournament for the host Americans, the 2026 world juniors have been a thrill ride for any hockey fan tuning in. Team USA was bounced in the quarterfinal by Finland - in overtime, no less - but the semifinals produced two beguiling games.\n\nSweden punched its ticket to the gold-medal game by besting archrival Finland in a shootout, while the Canadians and Czechs added another chapter to their burgeoning rivalry with a nasty back-and-forth game eventually won 6-4 by the Czechs.\n\nIt has been more than a decade since any country other than Canada, Finland or the U.S. has won gold at the world juniors and that streak now officially ends. With Sweden (2012) and Czechia (2001) both looking for a title after many years, the final game of the tournament promises to hold intrigue.\n\nBut what about the players themselves? There have been some fantastic individual performances in the tournament, so let's take a look at some of the standouts.\n\nLoaned out by the Calgary Flames for the world juniors, Parekh has shown why Canada wanted him for the tournament. Despite being a defenseman, Parekh entered the bronze-medal game tied for the tourney lead in scoring with 11 points in six games.\n\nThe Chicago Blackhawks first-rounder has been a monster for the Swedes and perhaps his most important goal to date came in the semifinal against Finland when he iced the contest with the winning shootout goal. Frondell's shot is a weapon and it has been on full display.\n\nThough the Americans were much weaker than in previous years, Zellers was a very pleasant surprise. The University of North Dakota winger and Boston Bruins pick led the U.S. in scoring with eight points in five games while playing an electric style.\n\nNow the highest-scoring defenseman in Czech world junior history, Galvas continues to add to his totals. Undrafted because of his small stature, he plays a similar game to Lane Hutson and could very well be selected in this summer's draft. Why not take a chance, right?\n\nSlovakia brought a young team to Minnesota and one of the best was 2026 draft prospect Chrenko, whose awesome shot propelled him up the scoring charts. His five goals in five games paced his team and he certainly helped his draft stock.\n\nHeavily scrutinized thanks to his top-prospect status, McKenna nonetheless has been one of the top scorers at the world juniors with 10 points in six games. The potential No. 1 pick in the 2026 draft got in trouble in the Czech game due to some fiery behavior.\n\nAnother top scorer in the tournament, Hage is a Montreal Canadiens first-rounder and a star at the University of Michigan. He made a ton of skilled plays for Canada and his chemistry with McKenna and Brady Martin (Nashville Predators) was something to see.\n\nThe captain of the Swedes, Berglund is a two-way center and a Philadelphia Flyers prospect who has made an impact at both ends of the ice for his team. Should Sweden win gold, Berglund undoubtedly will be part of the winning formula.\n\nA speedster with skill, Saarelainen is a Tampa Bay Lightning prospect who plays back home in Finland in the top pro league. He was very involved in Finland's offense against Sweden and is one to watch in the bronze-medal game against Canada.\n\nA first-round draft prospect for 2026, Bjorck is fast and skilled. He is clearly trusted by Sweden's coaches too, as they sent him over the boards every other shift in overtime against Finland, where he had an amazing four breakaways. While he couldn't convert, he's a talent.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Draft hopefuls and NHL prospects who headlined the world juniors",

    "fullText": "Wisconsin landed a transfer commitment from Southern Illinois transfer tight end Ryan Schwendeman on Saturday.\n\nSchwendeman entered the portal last week after four years with the Salukis. He originally joined the program as a two-star recruit in the class of 2022. After redshirting as a true freshman in 2022, he appeared in 25 games over the next three seasons, totaling 28 receptions, 327 yards and four touchdowns. His best season came as a redshirt junior in 2025, as he tallied 191 yards and two touchdowns on 15 receptions.\n\nThe veteran joins the Badgers with two years of eligibility remaining. He is one of two transfer additions at the position, along with Bowling Green transfer Jacob Harris. The two will look to become key passing options for quarterback Colton Joseph, who recently signed with the program. Unsurprisingly, the play of the transfer class will largely define the success of Wisconsin's 2026 offense.\n\nSouthern Illinois TE Ryan Schwendeman has signed with Wisconsin, his reps @nilsonsports tell @PeteNakos. \n\nThe 6-foot-5, 245-pound TE posted 15 catches, 191 yards and 2 TDs in 2025.

    "fullText": "What could have been for the New York Giants in Week 18...\n\nAfter losing control of the No. 1 overall pick in the 2026 NFL draft following a Week 17 victory over the Las Vegas Raiders, the Giants still had an opportunity to secure the top spot this past Sunday -- with some help.\n\nA loss to the Dallas Cowboys and an unlikely Raiders win (with a few other dominoes that ultimately fell into place), the Giants would have picked first overall in April. And as fate would have it, the stars aligned with a single exception: Big Blue themselves.\n\nThe Giants came out on fire and dismantled the Dallas Cowboys, 34-17, ending any hope of securing No. 1 overall before the Raiders even played. And perhaps that's why the outcomes of the afternoon slate of games sting a bit.\n\nUltimately, the Raiders did their part. They defeated the Kansas City Chiefs, 14-12, and did so in a way that is ironic for the Giants.\n\nSince 2014, 21% of all 60-plus-yard field goals have come against the Giants. All 21% have come late in the fourth quarter or in overtime. So it's only fitting that Las Vegas picked up their victory with a 60-yard field goal -- a career-long for kicker Daniel Carlson.\n\nWowza. #Raiders K Daniel Carlson just drilled a 60-yard FG for the win.\n\nRaiders will still have the No. 1 overall pick. The Chiefs draft position will also improve.pic.twitter.com/cQKPA1Wf0V\n\n— Ari Meirov (@MySportsUpdate) January 5, 2026\n\nUnderstandably, Giants fans reacted with frustration as the kick sailed through the uprights.\n\nIn the end, the kick and the Raiders' victory meant nothing for the Giants because the \"damage\" had already been done. Still, for Giants Nation, being on the positive end of a 60-yard field goal would have been a nice change of pace.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Giants Wire: Another 60-plus-yard field goal taunts New York Giants fans",

    "fullText": "Arsenal have had plenty of issues with injuries to defenders in recent months, with Gabriel Magalhaes, William Saliba, Piero Hincapie, Ben White, Jurrien Timber, Riccardo Calafiori, and Cristhian Mosquera all spending at least some time on the sidelines.\n\nCalafiori and Mosquera remain absent at the time of writing, and from the above list of players only Timber has missed fewer than four of the first 20 Premier League matches.\n\nNow, it seems Arsenal’s title rivals Manchester City are heading for a defensive injury crisis of their own, following weekend setbacks to Josko Gvardiol and Ruben Dias.\n\nGvardiol’s injury looked the more serious, with the centre-back hobbling off the pitch in the 51st minute of City’s draw with Chelsea and seemingly unable to put weight on his left ankle.\n\nAs for Dias, the centre-back withdrew from the contest in the 81st minute with an apparent muscle concern. Though with City winning the game 1-0 at that moment, it’s hard to know for sure whether the problem was genuine or a case of running down the clock.\n\nPep Guardiola didn’t seem particularly positive about either player in his post-match interview.\n\n“We’ll see but it doesn’t look good,” Guar­diola said (via The Telegraph and The Standard). “[Gvar­diol] and Ruben, we’ll see what hap­pens.\n\n“[With Gvardiol], apparently, it doesn’t look good. We will see tomorrow. I think he will be on the sidelines for a few weeks.\n\n“With Ruben it looks like muscle. I didn’t speak to the doc­tor but if Ruben is out it’s because he felt something.”\n\nGuardiola was then quick to point out that these aren’t City’s only defensive injuries, with John Stones already out of action and Nathan Ake’s fitness a perpetual concern.\n\n“We have a lot,” Guardiola said. “John Stones is miss­ing for I don’t know how many months. Ruben now will be out, Josko will be out. Nathan, always we know with Nathan he can­not play reg­u­larly.”\n\nIn terms of City’s next game against Brighton on Wednesday, it looks likely Abdukodir Khusanov and Ake will be starting together, unless Dias’ problem turns out to be nothing serious.\n\nBut if Dias is out for a while and Guardiola is right that Ake can’t play regularly, it becomes a real issue for him.\n\nOn the possibility of a new signing, Guardiola added: “I don’t think so but we’ll see what hap­pens because I know Ruben is a big loss and Josko is a big loss.”",

    "fullText": "Ranking 6 best Raiders coaching candidates to replace Pete Carroll, from Klint Kubiak to Chris Shula originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAccording to several reports, the return of Pete Carroll as an NFL head coach will last only one season. The former Seahawks Super Bowl winner flamed out with the Raiders in 2025 in a short but tumultuous tenure at age 74.\n\nCarroll's defense disappointed with Patrick Graham calling plays. The offense was a dysfunctional mess with coordinator Chip Kelly being fired during the season.\n\nKeeping in mind that Tom Brady is part owner and the team is well-positioned to take a franchise QB high in the 2026 NFL Draft, here's looking at the top potential replacements for Carroll.\n\nNFL MOCK DRAFT 2026:Raiders land Indiana's Fernando Mendoza at No. 1\n\nKlint Kubiak would be considered for his great pocket passing work with Sam Darnold in a balanced and explosive Seattle offense. He would be a great immediate personality and schematic influence on a rookie QB such as Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza or Oregon's Dante Moore.\n\nKliff Kingsbury is a good friend of Tom Brady's, having spent some time as a fellow Patriots QB. Kingsbury was huge in leading to a big rookie season for Jayden Daniels to help a quick turnaround in Washington in 2024. He also can provide that impact for Mendoza or Moore, as he was once attached to the Cardinals in 2019 when they were set to take Kyler Murray at No. 1 overall.\n\nMike LaFleur would be the top choice for Tom Brady and the ownership straight from the Sean McVay tree. He's overdue to get a job as the rising star younger brother of Packers coach Matt.\n\nVance Joseph would be a good defensive path to consider as he's become a stronger second-chance coaching candidate working under Sean Payton in Denver. He would help clean up things defensively and add some good experience.\n\nTom Brady can go after the former DC from his alma mater, Michigan, straight from fellow former Wolverines QB Jim Harbaugh. Jesse Minter is a rising star with his play-calling for the rival Chargers.\n\nTom Brady is a historian of the game and should also notice the strong influence and play-calling Chris Shula, the son of late Hall of Fame coaching legend Don, has done working on the other side of the ball from Mike LaFleur for McVay. Shula can provided needed youthful energy and motivation that was lost from Carroll.",

His issue has proven to be the straw that has broke the camel’s back, with Real Madrid having now made moves to address these recurring problems.\n\nAs per COPE (via Diario AS), Real Madrid have decided to bring back Niko Mihic to the day-to-day running of the first team’s medical department. Mihic, who had been the club’s chief medical officer during the managerial spells of Zinedine Zidane and Carlo Ancelotti, was sacked from that position in 2023 over the alleged mishandling of Arda Guler’s physical condition, but he had continued working in the background as an advisor at Valdebebas.\n\nIn his new role, Mihic will oversee everything that the first team does. He has the total backing of Real Madrid president Florentino Perez, who expects to see a reduction in the number of injuries suffered by Los Blancos players during the second half of the season.\n\nIt is clear that changes have been needed in Real Madrid’s medical department. The number of injuries has been very excessive for a while now, and it is very much unsustainable if they are to mount a challenge for the La Liga, Copa del Rey and Champions League title between now and the end of the 2025-26 campaign. For now, it remains to be seen whether Mihic’s return has a positive effect.",

Also, where they are at as a dressing room – have they lost a bit of faith in the manager and what he is doing?\n\n\"They are in a position now where if Nottingham Forest were to beat them, you just start to worry.\n\n\"The problem you get with the new signings coming in too is they have not played in the Premier League, so it is how quickly they can adapt and play under pressure.\n\n\"There is huge pressure at that football club at the moment.\"\n\nEx-Aston Villa and Brentford head coach Dean Smith agreed and added: \"They've got new signings but I never think January is a great month for signings. There becomes a slight desperation when you're looking to bring players in.\n\n\"But they definitely need some players just to have fresh faces in the dressing room because they need a bit of change at the moment.\n\n\"I do [think Nuno is the one to get them out of trouble]. He knows the league, he's been in the league a long time, getting Wolves promoted a long time ago and he did so well at Nottingham Forest last year too.\n\n\"[But] nine games without a win and they need to turn that around quickly. The game against Forest on Wednesday is massive, they can't lose that.\"\n\nListen to the full discussion from 01:50:00 on BBC Sounds",

I want to wish him and his staff all the best. We need them to succeed – simple as that.\n\n\"But, as Chelsea's first black player, I would be lying if I said this doesn't move me. I broke ground back in the day and faced things no player should face, just because of the colour of my skin.\"\n\nCanoville, who was subjected to racist abuse in the 1990s after making his Chelsea debut, now works closely with the club through his charitable foundation and has seen changes since his playing days.\n\n\"Since then, we've had trailblazers: Paul Elliott, the first black captain; Ken Monkou, the first black player of the year and Ruud Gullit showing we could manage at the highest level,\" he said.\n\n\"What really strikes me about Liam is that he grew up and played not far from here – he knows this community. His dad Leroy has an MBE for his work tackling discrimination in sport. That's exactly what we do at The Paul Canoville Foundation with young people every day.\n\n\"When kids see someone like Liam managing their club – someone who looks like them, who's from their area, who comes from a family that fights for what's right – that's powerful. It shows them the path is there.\n\n\"So yes, it's a massive moment for the club, for London and for every young person dreaming big. But let's back Liam and let the man do his work.\"",

    "fullText": "Ruben Amorim was sacked by Manchester United on Monday, bringing a dramatic end to his turbulent spell as manager of the struggling Premier League giants.\n\nThe dismissal of the Portuguese follows growing tensions between Amorim and the Old Trafford hierarchy, including director of football Jason Wilcox, in recent days.\n\nThe club, sixth in the Premier League after a 1-1 draw at Leeds on Sunday, issued a statement saying Amorim had \"departed his role as head coach of Manchester United\".\n\n\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,\" the club said.\n\n\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\n\n\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"\n\nCurrent under-18s coach Darren Fletcher will take charge of the team against struggling Burnley on Wednesday.\n\nAmorim was fired less than 24 hours after making a string of eye-catching comments at Elland Road, where he stressed he was United's manager rather than \"just the coach\", having hinted at frustration behind the scenes on Friday.\n\nThe Portuguese told the scouting department and Wilcox \"to do their job\" during a blockbuster end to a post-match press conference that raised major doubts over his future.\n\nAmorim repeatedly suggested to the media that he would leave when his contract expired in 18 months' time.\n\nBut reports said United's decision to axe their manager was due to the lack of evolution and progress during his 14-month tenure rather than a power struggle.\n\nIt is a dismal end to the reign of Amorim, who won just 25 of his 63 games at the helm in all competitions.\n\nIn the Premier League he had the worst win ratio (32 percent), the worst goals-conceded-per-game ratio (1.53) and the lowest clean-sheet ratio (15 percent) of any United manager.\n\nAmorim arrived at Old Trafford to replace Erik ten Hag in November 2024 as one of the most sought-after coaches in world football following a successful stint at Sporting Lisbon, where he won two league titles.\n\nBut he struggled badly in his first season in charge as United slumped to a 15th-place finish in the Premier League -- their worst campaign for 51 years.\n\nAmorim led the team to the Europa League final in Bilbao in May but they lost to Tottenham, meaning they missed out on European football this season.\n\nUnited have made marginal improvements during the current campaign but have been inconsistent, winning just eight of their 20 league games so far, and are 17 points behind leaders Arsenal.\n\nAmorim's stint is the shortest reign of a permanent manager at United since David Moyes was sacked just eight months into his tenure in 2014.\n\nThe club, 20-time English champions, have not won the Premier League since 2013, in Alex Ferguson's final season in charge.\n\nFormer United midfielder Fletcher was the club's technical director between 2021 and 2024, but he has never held a senior coaching position.",

    "fullText": "With Cadillac joining the grid for the 2026 Formula 1 season, there will be 22 cars on the grid, two more than we're currently used to. Because of this, qualifying will see a small change to include the extra two cars. This is what you need to know.\n\nF1's 2026 qualifying format will still have the familiar three-part knockout structure that we're all accustomed to. With a larger grid this year, slight changes have been made to ensure the fight for pole in Q3 still includes just 10 cars.\n\nUnder the FIA's 2026 sporting regulations, qualifying is still split into Q1, Q2 and Q3, with the same timed run plan.\n\nQ1 lasts 18 minutes, followed by a seven-minute break. Q2 will run for 15 minutes with another seven-minute break, and Q3 will last 12 minutes with an eight-minute break. What's different is the cut line.\n\nThe regulations explain that the “procedure detailed in this Article is based upon twenty (20) Cars being officially eligible”, but then add the scaling clause: “If twenty-two (22) Cars are eligible six (6) will be eliminated after Q1 and Q2.”\n\nSo with 22 cars, this is what the format will look like:\n\nP17–P22 (based on fastest Q1 times among eliminated)\n\nP11–P16 (based on fastest Q2 times among eliminated)\n\nP1–P10 (based on fastest Q3 times)\n\nThe sporting regulations confirm that lap times achieved by the remaining cars will then be deleted at the end of Q1, and this same rule applies to Q2 when the field is reduced once again. Just like 2025, there is no banking a better time in a previous section.\n\nSprint qualifying sees the same changes, albeit with shorter sessions.\n\nP17–P22 (based on fastest SQ1 times among eliminated)\n\nP11–P16 (based on fastest SQ2 times among eliminated)\n\nP1–P10 (based on fastest SQ3 times)\n\nWith 22 cars on the grid, we're not seeing a reinvented qualifying. While six drivers will be eliminated in Q1 and Q2, the format still funnels the top 10 cars into Q3 for a normal fight for pole.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

The fee consists of a flat rate plus an amount per point scored in the previous season. For Norris, he scored 423 points in 2025, so at €2,392 per point, plus the flat rate of €11,842, the Briton will pay €1,023,658 for the upcoming season.\n\nFour-time champion Max Verstappen, who finished the 2025 season second in the championship with just two points behind Norris, will also have to pay over €1million. Norris's McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri's bill comes in at just under a million after his third-place finish.\n\nAlpine driver Franco Colapinto, who was the only driver not to score a point in 2025, will only have to pay the flat rate of €11,842. In addition to the Argentinian driver, Arvid Lindblad, Valtteri Bottas and Sergio Perez will all only pay the base rate, as they did not race in F1 last year.\n\nVerstappen holds the record for the highest superlicence fee after paying €1,217,900 for 2024, following his dominant 2023 season in which he scored 575 points.\n\nTo read more Motorsport.com articles visit our website.",

    "fullText": "A public holiday will mark Scotland's men's national team playing in its first World Cup since 1998.\n\nScotland will face Haiti in Boston at 02:00 GMT on Sunday 14 June, before taking on Morocco and Brazil in their remaining group fixtures in the United States.\n\nFirst Minister John Swinney has proposed that 15 June is designated as a national bank holiday - though the move will only affect staff directly employed by the Scottish government.\n\nLike the St Andrews' Day bank holiday, other employers would not be compelled to observe it.\n\nThe proposal will be formally confirmed once it has been rubber-stamped by the King.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Glasgow, Swinney said: \"The whole nation will come to a standstill in June - even more so in July once we've seen off Brazil and progressed to the knockout stages.\n\n\"This is a moment 28 years in the waiting - and I want as many people as possible to share the occasion.\"\n\nHe added: \"That will mean that supporters across the country can watch our men's team in their first World Cup match for almost 30 years, and share in the chance for Scotland to be on the world stage, to attract business development, to create tourism and hospitality interest within the country and to make deep and lasting cultural and sporting connections.\"\n\nScotland is able to set distinct bank holidays from the rest of the UK.\n\nA day can be appointed as a bank holiday in Scotland by royal proclamation.\n\nThe first minister is able to advise the Privy Council - an advisory board to the monarch - on proclamations for Scotland, which are formally signed off by the King.\n\nScotland face Morocco in Boston on 19 June, and Brazil in Miami on 24 June. Both games kick off at 23:00 GMT.\n\nSwinney has previously said that the government would work with local authorities on extending pub opening hours during the World Cup.\n\nThe Scottish government simply does not have the power to give people across the country - including those working in the private sector or in parts of the public sector controlled by the UK government - an extra, specified day off work.\n\nBut an extra holiday may be a pragmatic response to the situation some businesses may face on the morning after Scotland's opening World Cup game. How many might want to stay up late and then take the day off?\n\nDecisions on whether or not to give staff the day off are for individual employers to take.\n\nIn general, bank or public holidays do not have to be given as paid leave by employers.\n\nAn employer can choose to include bank holidays as part of a worker's statutory annual leave.\n\nEmployment contracts tend to specify that employers have a certain number of days off every year - inclusive of bank holidays.\n\nNor is there any reason why private business would need to close. There are no restrictions on opening hours on bank holidays.\n\nEven the major Scottish high street banks do not close on Scottish bank holidays now - they observe English bank holidays, to stay in line with their sister businesses south of the border.\n\nSchool holidays are already set for the coming year by individual councils. Some may consider whether to look at giving the special bank holiday as a day off, but there are also rules on how many days schools need to open for to consider.\n\n'Scotland qualifying for the World Cup put me in hospital'\n\nScots celebrate reaching first World Cup in nearly 30 years",

    "fullText": "PDC Q-School 2026: Hundreds undertake the toughest tungsten task originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThose of you still coming down from the annual fix of the World Championship may not realise that a brand new season darts season starts today! PDC Q-School 2026 is appearing on the horizon. The pathway to tungsten immortality leads straight through here for all but the Luke Littlers among us!\n\nFor those of you with questions about what an arduous and bruising experience it is, The Sporting News has you covered.\n\nEvery January, while the darting elite are still nursing bruises from Alexandra Palace and the confetti is barely swept from the floor, another, far more ruthless drama begins. No lights. No walk-ons. No safety net. Just tungsten, tension and survival. This is PDC Q-School – the sport’s most unforgiving proving ground.\n\nWe explained previously how the PDC came into being and while there are other excellent organisations scattered across the globe - some affiliated, others off doing their own thing entirely - the PDC is the Mac Daddy. The top seat at the tungsten table. But how do you get your place?\n\nFrom 5th to 11th January, nearly nine hundred hopefuls will descend on two venues with one shared obsession: relevance. The UK based half of the army will march into Milton Keynes, the others from Europe and far beyond, into Kalkar. By the end of the week, only 29 of them will emerge holding a PDC Tour Card. For everyone else, it’s back to the wilderness.\n\nThis is Q-School’s sixteenth edition, and by now its reputation precedes it. Brutal. Relentless. Merciless. Careers are reborn here. Others quietly end. And the stories that come out of it often shape the sport for the next decade.\n\nIf anyone doubts its importance, look no further than Gian van Veen. Less than three years ago, he was just another name on the Kalkar entry list. Today, he’s a European Champion, World Youth Champion and PDC World Championship finalist. Or, by the time you read this, he may well be in the possession of the famous Sid Waddell trophy and the small matter of a £1m cheque folded nicely inside). Q-School doesn’t promise success – but it offers the door. What happens next is on you.\n\nQ-School is split into two brutal chapters. stage one runs from 5th to 7th January – a survival filter for the masses. Anyone without exemption must pass through here. Only those who lost their Tour Card the previous season, or finished highly on the Challenge or Development Tours, earn direct passage to stage two.\n\nProgression is simple in theory and savage in practice. Reach the last 16 on any stage one day and you punch your ticket forward. Miss that, and every single win becomes currency. From 2026 onwards, each full-round victory equals one ranking point, feeding into the First Stage Order of Merit. Consistency, not just flashes of brilliance, gets you through. Stage two, running 8th to 11th January, is where careers are decided.\n\nTour Cards are split between the two locations on a pro-rata basis. In total, 29 are available. In a change from the norm, sixteen go directly to the finalists across the four stage two days – a major shift from earlier years when only daily winners were rewarded. The remaining 13 are handed out via the Q-School Order of Merit, rewarding players who grind relentlessly deep across the week. The top five on the UK ranking together with highest eight place on its European counterpart receive the golden tickets.\n\nIt’s darts’ most democratic brutality. No reputation points. No shortcuts. Perform or perish.\n\nEntry is not symbolic. Around £475 (plus VAT in the UK) buys you a seat at the table. Enough money to ensure only those with genuine belief – or glorious delusion – step forward. But that fee unlocks more than Q-School. Every entrant becomes eligible for the PDC Challenge Tour, a shadow battlefield where Pro Tour call-ups are constantly available. Start hot there, and doors creak open fast.\n\nQ-School failure is not the end – just a detour. The Challenge Tour, WDF circuit, MODUS Super Series, and the rapidly expanding Amateur Darts Circuit all offer routes back to the light. Some, like Rob Cross and Luke Humphries, never won a Tour Card at Q-School at all – yet climbed anyway.\n\nThat’s the beauty and cruelty of darts in 2026. There is always a path. But none of them are easy.\n\nQ-School is not about talent alone. It’s about resilience. Timing. Nerve. It doesn’t create champions – it exposes them. And for those stepping up this January, remember one thing: Finding the golden ticket is only the beginning. Keeping hold of it… that’s where the real fight starts.\n\nFor the full stories and \n\nDarts World subscriptions options include Print, Digital and All Access packages, as well as exclusive products and competitions",

    "description": "When I moved to a new apartment with my family, the cable company we were used to wasn't available. We had to settle for Dish Network. I wasn't too happy about making that switch, but something on the",
    "fullText": "When I moved to a new apartment with my family, the cable company we were used to wasn't available. We had to settle for Dish Network. I wasn't too happy about making that switch, but something on their website caught my attention. For an additional $5 a month, I could have access to DVR. I switched immediately.\n\nThis was 2007. DVR was not new, but it wasn't commonly bundled with set-top boxes. TiVo was still the popular way to record, pause, and rewind live TV. We received two set-top boxes, one for each room with a TV, and three remotes. Two remotes had IR (infrared) blasters and, surprisingly, one RF (radio frequency) remote.\n\nAfter using the RF remote, I wondered: Why would anyone ever use an IR remote again? You didn't need a direct line of sight with the device you were controlling. I could actually stand in the kitchen and control the TV. It was amazing. But with the convenience of RF came other problems that IR users never had to worry about. Interference.\n\nAfter several months of enjoying my service, one of my neighbors, the loudest in the building, also switched to Dish Network. And he also got the RF remote. This was the type of neighbor who would leave the house with the TV on, volume blasting.\n\nOne day, I was in the living room watching TV when the channel just flipped. I must have accidentally hit a button, so I changed it back. But not a few seconds later, the channel changed again. Then the volume went up. I figured my sister must have had the RF remote and was messing with me. But no, the remote was in my hand. I assumed something was wrong with it.\n\nThe whole time I was watching TV, the channels kept randomly switching. I banged the remote on the table a couple of times, but it still switched. I removed the batteries from the remote, it still switched. I unplugged the device for a few minutes, plugged it back in, and… it still switched. Frustrated, I went through the device settings and disabled the RF remote. That's when it finally stopped. I wasn't happy with this solution, but it allowed me to watch TV until I figured something out.\n\nOne evening, when everyone was asleep and the neighbor was watching a loud TV show, I decided to diagnose the issue. The moment I pressed the power button on the RF remote, my TV and set-top box turned on, and the neighbor's TV went silent. \"Fuck!\" I heard someone say. I was confused. Did I just do that? The TV turned back on, the volume went up. I walked to the window armed with the remote. I counted to three, then pressed the power button. My neighbor's TV went silent. He growled.\n\nEvery time he turned the TV on, I pressed the power button again and his device went off. Well, what do you know? We had interference somehow. Our remotes were set up to operate at the same frequency. Each remote controlled both devices.\n\nBut I'm not that kind of neighbor. I wasn't going to continue to mess with him. Instead, I decided I would pay him a visit in the morning and explain that our remotes are tuned to the same frequency. I would bring the RF remote with me just to show him a demo. I was going to be a good neighbor.\n\nIn the morning, I went downstairs, remote in hand. I knocked on the door, and a gentleman in his forties answered the door. I had rehearsed my speech and presentation. This would be a good opportunity to build a good rapport, and have a shared story. Maybe he would tell me how he felt when the TV went off. How he thought there was a ghost in the house or something. But that's not what happened.\n\n\"Hi, I'm Ibrahim. Your upstairs neighbor...\" I started and was interrupted almost immediately. \"Whatever you are selling,\" he yelled. \"I'm not buying.\" and he closed the door on my face. I knocked a second time, because obviously there was a misunderstanding. He never answered. Instead, the TV turned on and a movie played at high volume. So much for my prepared speech.\n\nThe RF settings on my set-top box remained turned off. My family never discovered its benefit anyway, they always pointed at the box when pressing the buttons. It wasn't much of an inconvenience. In fact, I later found in the manual that you could reprogram the device and remote to use a different frequency. I did not reprogram my remote. Instead, my family used the two IR remotes, and brought the RF remote in my bedroom where it permanently remained on my night stand.\n\nWhy in the bedroom? Because I decided to teach my neighbor some good manners. Whenever he turned up his volume, I would simply turn off his device. I would hear his frustration, and his attempts at solving the problem. Like a circus animal trainer, I remained consistent. If the volume of his TV went above what I imagined to be 15 to 20, I would press the power button. It became a routine for me for weeks. Some nights were difficult, I would keep the remote under my pillow, battling my stubborn neighbor all night.\n\nOne day, I noticed that I hadn't pressed the button in days. I opened the window and I could still hear the faint sound of his TV. Through trial and error, he learned the lesson. If the volume remained under my arbitrary threshold, the TV would remain on. But as soon as he passed that threshold, the device would turn off.\n\nSometimes, he would have company and there would be noise coming out of his apartment. I used the one tool in my tool box to send him a message. Turn off the TV. All of the sudden, my neighbor and his guest will be reminded of the unspoken rules, and become mindful of their neighbors.\n\nMaybe somewhere on the web, in some obscure forum, someone asked the question: \"Why does my set-top box turn off when I increase the volume?\" Well, it might be 18 years too late, but there's your answer. There is a man out there who religiously sets his volume to 18. He doesn't quite know why. That's Pavlovian conditioning at its best.",

    "fullText": "Pity the paradox of the content producer in the age of AI. On one hand, AI is one of the greatest gifts ever in terms of topics to cover. The 2025 Stratechery Year in Review was, just like 2024 and 2023 (plus a few bangers in 2022) completely dominated by AI; my Sharp Tech co-host Andrew Sharp wrote The Definitive Ranking of Tech Company Takeability, and OpenAI was number one with a bullet:\n\nOpenAI may or may not be the most important company of the future. There can be no doubt, however, that we are witnessing one of the most takeable enterprises in the history of the world. From the day it was founded — with a non-profit corporate structure that sought to build AGI and then control it themselves “to ensure artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity” — this company has divided the audience and invited either passionate support or aggressive eye-rolls.\n\nOn the other hand, LLMs in particular are quite literally content producers! What’s the point of writing analysis when ChatGPT or Gemini or Claude will deliver analysis on demand, about any topic you want? Is this one of those situations like the early web, where the possibility of reaching everyone seemed like a boon but was actually a ticking time bomb for the viability of the traditional publishing model?\n\nI’m actually pretty optimistic about Stratechery Plus’ fortunes for reasons I laid out in last year’s Content and Community:\n\nSo, are existing publishers doomed? Well, by-and-large yes, but that’s because they have been doomed for a long time. People using AI instead of Google — or Google using AI to provide answers above links — make the long-term outlook for advertising-based publishers worse, but that’s an acceleration of a demise that has been in motion for a long time.\n\nWhat I think is intriguing, however, is the possibility to go back to the future. Once upon a time publishing made countries; the new opportunity for publishing is to make communities. This is something that AI, particularly as it manifests today, is fundamentally unsuited to: all of that content generated by LLMs is individualized; what you ask, and what the AI answers, is distinct from what I ask, and what answers I receive. This is great for getting things done, but it’s useless for creating common ground…\n\nStratechery, on the other hand, along with a host of other successful publications, has the potential to be a totem pole around which communities can form…There is a need for community, and I think content, whether it be an essay, a podcast, or a video, can be artifacts around which communities can form and sustain themselves, ultimately to the economic benefit of the content creator. There is, admittedly, a lot to figure out in terms of that last piece, but when you remember that content made countries, the potential upside is likely quite large indeed.\n\nThis might, to be fair, be wishful thinking: maybe I’m doomed, but if I’m doomed, probably everyone else is too, particularly when you think about the very long run.\n\nIt’s the very long run that a fellow content producer, Dwarkesh Patel, considered alongside Philip Trammell in a widely discussed post over the winter break entitled Capital in the 22nd Century:\n\nIn his 2013 Capital in the Twenty-first Century, the socialist economist Thomas Piketty argued that, absent strong redistribution, economic inequality tends to increase indefinitely through the generations — at least until shocks, like large wars or prodigal sons, reset the clock. This is because the rich tend to save more than the poor and because they can get higher returns on their investments.\n\nAs many noted at the time, this is probably an incorrect account of the past. Labor and capital complement each other. Wealthy people can keep accumulating capital, but hammers grow less valuable when there aren’t enough hands to use all of them, and hands grow more valuable when hammers are plentiful. Capital accumulation thus lowers interest rates (aka income per unit of capital) and raises wages (income per unit of labor). This effect has tended to be strong enough that, though inequality may have grown for other reasons, inequality from capital accumulation alone has been self-correcting.\n\nBut in a world of advanced robotics and AI, this correction mechanism will break. That is, though Piketty was wrong about the past, he will probably be right about the future…If AI is used to lock in a more stable world, or at least one in which ancestors can more fully control the wealth they leave to their descendants (let alone one in which they never die), the clock-resetting shocks could disappear. Assuming the rich do not become unprecedentedly philanthropic, a global and highly progressive tax on capital (or at least capital income) will then indeed be essentially the only way to prevent inequality from growing extreme. Without one, once AI renders capital a true substitute for labor, approximately everything will eventually belong to those who are wealthiest when the transition occurs, or their heirs. Or more precisely, it will belong to the subset of this group who save most and most invest with a view to maximizing long-run returns.\n\nThere is an aspect to this argument that is of the dorm room discussion variety: even if we are approaching the point where AI can create AI (Claude Opus 4.5 appears to be a major leap forward in coding capability in particular), there is still a lot of work to do in terms of making it possible for AI to break out of its digital box and impact the real world via robotics. Part of the thinking, however, is that once AI can create AI, it can rapidly accelerate the development of robotics as well, until robots are making robots, each generation more capable than the next, until everything humans do today — both in the digital but also the physical world — can be done better by AI.\n\nThis is the world where capital drives all value, and labor none, in stark contrast to the approximately 33% share of GDP that has traditionally gone to capital, with 66% share of GDP going to labor. After all, you don’t pay robots for marginal labor: you build them once…check that, they build themselves, from materials they harvested, not just here on earth but across the galaxy, and do everything at zero marginal cost, a rate with which no human can compete.\n\nI get the logic of Patel and Trammell’s argument, but I — perhaps, once again, over-optimistically — am skeptical about this being a problem, particularly one that needs to be addressed right here right now before the AI takeoff occurs, especially given the acute need for more capital investment at this moment in time.\n\nFirst, the world Patel and Trammell envisions sounds like it would be pretty incredible for everyone. If AI can do everything, then it follows that everyone can have everything, from food and clothing to every service you can imagine (remember, the AI is so good that there are zero jobs for humans, which implies that all of the jobs can be done by robots for everyone). Does it matter if you don’t personally own the robots if every material desire is already met?\n\nSecond, on the flipside, this world also sounds implausible. It seems odd that AI would acquire such fantastic capabilities and yet still be controlled by humans and governed by property laws as commonly understood in 2025. I find the AI doomsday scenario — where this uber-capable AI is no longer controllable by humans — to be more realistic; on the flipside, if we start moving down this path of abundance, I would expect our collective understanding of property rights to shift considerably.\n\nThird, it’s worth noting that we have seen dramatic shifts in labor in human history. Consider both agricultural revolutions: in the pre-Neolithic era zero percent of humans worked in agriculture; fast-forward to 1810, and 81% of the U.S. population worked in agriculture. Then came the second agriculture revolution, such that 200 years later only 1% of the U.S. population works in agriculture. It’s that decline that is particularly interesting to me: humans were replaced by machines, even as food became abundant and dramatically cheaper; no one is measuring their purchases based on how much food cost in 1700, just as they won’t measure their future purchases on the cost of material goods in a pre-robotics world.\n\nThat’s because humans didn’t just sit on their hands; rather, entirely new kinds of work were created, which were valued dramatically higher. Much of this was in factories, and then, over the last century, there was the rise of office work. All of that could very well be replaced by AI, but the point is that the history of humans is the continual creation of new jobs to be done — jobs that couldn’t have been conceived of before they were obvious, and which pay dramatically more than whatever baseline existed before technological change.\n\nLike, if I might be cheeky, professional podcaster! Podcasts didn’t even exist thirty years ago, and yet here is Patel — and me! — accumulating capital simply by speaking into a mic and taking advantage of the Internet’s zero marginal cost of distribution, a concept that itself was unthinkable fifty years ago.\n\nIt’s possible, of course — and to return to my perhaps self-interested and potentially misplaced optimism above — that robots will be better at podcasting than Patel or I. I’m skeptical, though: my experience — and I’ll only speak for myself here — is that the human element is essential in creating compelling content. Sure, sometimes I say “uhm” or “like” or “sort of”, or I get facts wrong, but that’s a feature, not a bug: what I have to say is by definition unique to me, and that is interesting precisely because I am flesh-and-blood, not a robot.1\n\nIndeed, another way to frame the optimism I have around my career is that the dynamics are the exact inverse of AI:\n\nRight now it is individual humans who are uniquely capable to reach audiences at scale; AI, on the other hand, is about scaling compute to deliver results to individuals. Patel and Trammell were, to be sure, talking about the 22nd century, while this is a depiction of the first quarter of the 21st, but I think the desire for a communal experience will persist, and I think those experiences will continue to be organized around other humans, not machines.\n\nMore generally, I don’t think that this will be limited to podcasting (if such a concept even exists in one hundred years). Consider the most base example: sex. I have no doubt that there will be human-like robots with which you can have sex; I also have even stronger conviction that the overwhelming preference of humans will be to have sex with other humans. And that, by extension, means that all of the courtship and status games that go into finding a lover will persist, and that that itself will be an entire economy all its own. One will not impress a partner with commodity robot-generated goods, no matter how objectively perfect they might be: true value will come from uniqueness and imperfections that are downstream from a human.\n\nIn fact, I have great optimism that one potential upside of AI is a renewed appreciation of and investment in beauty. One of the great tragedies of the industrial era — particularly today — is that beauty in our built environment is nowhere to be found. How is it that we built intricate cathedrals hundreds of years ago, and forgettable cookie-cutter crap today? That is, in fact, another labor story: before the industrial revolution labor was abundant and cheap, which meant it was defensible to devote thousands of person-years into intricate buildings; once labor was made more productive, and thus more valuable, it simply wasn’t financially viable to divert so much talent for so much time. Perhaps it follows, then, that the devaluing of labor Patel and Trammell warns about actually frees humans up to once again create beauty? Yes, robots could do it too, but I think humans will value the work of other humans more. Indeed, I think this is coming sooner than you might think: I expect the widespread availability of high quality AI art to actually make human art more desirable and valuable, precisely because of its provenance.2\n\nIt’s also worth noting the relative popularity of human-generated content versus AI-generated content. Sora is down to 59 in the App Store, and I count double-digit human-denominated social apps that rank above it. Yes, I get the argument that this is the worst that AI will ever be, but it also will never be human, which is what humans want most of all.\n\nThis gets at what I found the most frustrating about Patel and Trammell’s point of view: the core assumption undergirding their argument was also about the human condition; it just happened to be negative.\n\nLouis C.K., in an October 2008 appearance on Late Night with Conan O’Brien, delivered one of the most incisive and eternal observations about human nature: “Everything is amazing right now and nobody’s happy.”\n\nYou’ve almost certainly seen this clip, but if not, it’s worth watching in full; Louis C.K. focuses on three incredible technological innovations and how quickly we took them for granted: smartphones, Internet access on planes, and the act of flying itself. It’s certainly a sentiment I can relate to: just in the last 72 hours I have chafed at slow airplane WiFi, complained about jet lag from having literally traversed the globe, and gotten frustrated at an iPhone bug that is sapping my battery. It’s all so terrible, until I remember I have access to anything everywhere, can be anywhere anytime, and oh yeah, can achieve both simultaneously.\n\nIf anything, you can make the case that technological innovations, by virtue of conferring their benefits on everybody, has actually had the perverse effect of making everyone feel worse off. When I was a child growing up in small town Wisconsin, I had some sort of vague sense that there were rich people in the world, but from my perspective taking my first airplane flight around the age of ten was a source of great wonder, and even provided a sense of status; after all, many of my friends had never flown at all. That was the comparison set that mattered to me.\n\nSocial media — or, more accurately, user-generated content feeds, which are increasingly not social at all — has completely changed this dynamic. All I or anyone else needs to do is open Instagram to see beautiful people on private jets or on beaches or at fancy restaurants, living a life that seems dramatically better than one’s dull existence in the suburbs or a cramped apartment; never mind that the means of achieving that insight is a level of technological wealth that would have been incomprehensible to the richest person in the world fifty years ago.\n\nTo put it another way, what Louis C.K. identified in this clip was the extent to which human happiness is a relative versus absolute phenomenon: what we care about is not how much we have, but how we compare. That, by extension, is what drives the technological paradox I noted above: more capabilities, more broadly distributed, has tremendously enriched the world on an absolute basis; the end result, however, has been the dramatic expansion of our comparison set, making us feel more immiserated than ever.3\n\nThis, writ large, is what Patel and Trammell seem to be worried about: sure, everyone may have all of their material needs met, but that won’t be good enough if the price of that abundance is the knowledge that someone else has more. This might not be rational, but it certainly is human!\n\nIf you assume that the negative parts of humanity will persist in this world of abundance, however, then you must leave room for the positive parts as well, the ones that I wrote about above. Even if AI does all of the jobs, humans will still want humans, creating an economy for labor precisely because it is labor. You can’t make the case that the potential for jealousy ought to drive authoritarian capital controls while completely dismissing the possibility that the prospect of desirability gives everyone jobs to do, even if we can’t possibly imagine what those jobs might be — beyond podcasting, of course.\n\nIf you want a specific example, consider the rapturous response to Bill Simmons’ 50 Most Rewatchable Movies of the 21st Century episode, which was delightful precisely because it was pure Bill ↩\n\nThis isn’t idle talk: I’m encouraging my daughter to pursue art; granted, I’m also working quite hard to build up a store of capital for her as well! ↩\n\nAs an aside, this is why galaxy exploration would be a positive, not a negative: out of sight out of mind, just like it used to be. ↩",

After his service ended, he remained in Japan, establishing Rosen Enterprises in 1954.

    "fullText": "On 9 May, people march in arms in Moscow — in the countries of the Union, peace and prosperity are celebrated, often timidly. But what are we really celebrating when war has returned to Europe and the economy is in crisis? Faced with new empires, Agathe Cagé and Sylvie Matelly call for the rearmament of European sovereignty to meet democratic expectations on the continent.\n\nThe last few weeks have been rich in summits, declarations of intent and proposals to ‘rearm Europe’. Faced with the unexpected rapprochement between Vladimir Putin and Donald Trump, Europeans seem to have finally understood that they must successfully navigate the continent’s geopolitical transition. Confronted with an aggressive Russia, an unpredictable American ally and an offensive China, the rearmament of Europe is on everyone’s lips and in everyone’s minds. However, it must be noted that, until now, this has mostly given rise to debates focused primarily on the amount of defence spending increases to be expected, or on the trade-offs between social and military spending, as if rearming were limited to purchasing weapons of European preference.\n\nHowever, it seems that the essential issue in this debate is being overlooked, namely the question of sovereignty. Sovereignty must be the driving force behind Europe’s comprehensive rearmament. Indeed, if Europe needs to rearm, it is first and foremost because it is threatened not only by an aggressive country on its eastern flank, but also by certain American statements and actions. The resulting balance of power requires Europe to give itself the means to be fully free in all areas to determine its own future and resources (which does not mean, as the President of the United States seems to think, being isolated and withdrawn).\n\nThe European Union and its member countries have demonstrated, in the face of the various crises that have struck them in recent years, a strong capacity for resilience that has enabled them to overcome geopolitical tensions, pandemics and financial crises.\n\nIn the new world order, where cooperation seems to be giving way more and more to competition, or even predation, this resilience alone may prove insufficient. That is why Europeans must take a further step: that of building a solid and ambitious European sovereignty.\n\nSovereignty can be defined as the ability to freely decide one’s own destiny, to enforce one’s choices and to be recognised as legitimate in this role, whether at the level of a state or a larger entity — such as the European Union — when acting on behalf of its Member States. In this context, building European sovereignty means focusing on five dimensions.\n\nThe first step is to take charge of the security and defence of the Union and the European continent and to build the Union’s strategic independence from the United States (in other words, to build the Union’s military sovereignty).\n\nThis poses several underlying challenges, such as the need to massively increase the Union’s defence capabilities, to equip it with strategic superiority capabilities, to build a common defence policy based on the complementarities of each member (efforts must be optimally distributed) and to adopt a new strategic culture. To paraphrase Louis Gautier, Director of the Chair in Contemporary Strategic Issues at Paris 1 Panthéon Sorbonne University, the Union needs good programmes and projects in order to spend wisely. Naturally, it is essential to give priority to the acquisition of European equipment in order to gradually build up a European preference. Finally, the creation of a common market for the defence industry, as recommended by Enrico Letta in his report Much More Than A Market (April 2024), would help to strengthen collective industrial defence capabilities within the EU by enabling economies of scale and reducing costly fragmentation and duplication. Antoine Bouvier, former CEO of European missile manufacturer MBDA, clearly explained in early April that we must finally decide whether we want to adopt a ‘best athlete’ approach or a ‘best team’ approach within the Union — the latter being one of true cooperation between partners.\n\nEuropeans must take a further step: that of building a solid and ambitious European sovereignty.\n\nBuilding European sovereignty also means guaranteeing the Union’s sovereignty in terms of human security by reducing strategic dependencies, i.e. guaranteeing agricultural and food sovereignty, health sovereignty (first and foremost, securing supplies of critical medicines) and securing the Union’s water supply.\n\nThe Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 and the energy crisis in 2022 highlighted significant dependencies (in terms of masks, electronic components, gas, medicines, etc.) that weakened the Union’s ability to manage these crises and protect its citizens. Building on these difficult experiences, the EU must now focus on establishing and asserting its leadership in human security. This is essential to its attractiveness in a world of climate and geopolitical crises, and this attractiveness is a key factor in the future of the EU. Current demographic projections are indeed worrying: the gap between the growth of the working-age population in the Union and that in the United States is widening and, according to Eurostat projections, the population of the Union aged 75 and over will increase from 43.8 million in 2020 to 75.4 million in 2050. However, only a younger and more attractive European Union can establish itself as a human and economic power on the world stage. Furthermore, such demographic strengthening of Europe is essential to guarantee the future of its social protection and pension systems.\n\nGuaranteeing digital, technological and industrial sovereignty is the third pillar of building European sovereignty. This aspect of the Union’s sovereignty is essential to supporting its growth and competitiveness and therefore also constitutes a foundation for national social progress policies — and perhaps, in the future, for European social policy.\n\nSeveral challenges underlie this: defining the Union’s industrial strategies to build a competitive European industrial policy; financing future investments towards carbon neutrality and digital transformation; regulating AI and digital platforms; reducing dependence on fossil fuels and ensuring energy autonomy; reducing dependence on supplies of critical metals; developing new supply and value chains, particularly in neighbouring countries with shared interests (in this sense, new relationships need to be built between the EU and African countries); and, finally, filtering investments and protecting strategic assets.\n\nIn other words, the EU must improve its competitiveness, increase its industrial production capacity, reduce its vulnerabilities and dependencies, and establish itself in the field of digital infrastructure and data design, manufacturing and operation. In terms of supplies, while China currently dominates nearly two-thirds of the global value chain for zero-carbon technologies, as well as virtually all the technologies and capacities for processing and refining the metals needed for this transition, some projections suggest that the EU’s imports of green materials and technologies could be reduced by €140 billion per year. Reducing these dependencies is also one of the ambitions of the European Critical Raw Materials Act.\n\nIf Europe does not have its own infrastructure in the future, it will be difficult — if not impossible — for it to enforce its values and standards.\n\nFurthermore, in an increasingly digitalised world, the EU cannot afford to be dependent on GAFAM (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) or BATX (Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, Xiaomi) for its strategic technologies.\n\nIt has been a pioneer in protecting citizens by adopting the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in 2018. But if Europe does not have its own infrastructure (cloud, software, networks) in the future, it will be difficult — if not impossible — for it to enforce its values and standards. Control over data is the lifeblood of economic sovereignty. The EU must urgently step up its efforts in terms of cloud services, the establishment of large data centres, the infrastructure, software and service layers of artificial intelligence models, etc.\n\nContinuing to assume global leadership in driving the climate transition, i.e. asserting its environmental sovereignty, is the fourth pillar of building European sovereignty.\n\nThe challenges here are directly linked to the issues of asserting the Union’s technological and industrial sovereignty. The EU must continue the transition to a carbon-free economy and clean energy and build green industrial power. To this end, it must support investment in the circular economy, whose most successful models are often based on cutting-edge technological innovations and which contribute to reducing expenditure on raw material imports. Leading the climate transition is also directly linked to the protection of human health. The damage caused by climate change is indeed massive and fourfold: heat waves, deterioration in air quality, pressure on resources (particularly the availability of good-quality water and the risk of food insecurity), and the exacerbation of chronic diseases and the spread of infectious diseases.\n\nFinally, the Union’s strategic autonomy must aim to protect and promote its democratic and social model, in other words its democratic sovereignty.\n\nBuilding European sovereignty will not take away sovereignty from Member States: it will enable them to regain sovereignty in areas where they had, in fact, lost it.\n\nA sovereign Europe will be better able to resist foreign interference — whether in the form of propaganda, disinformation campaigns, cyberattacks or digital interference campaigns, etc. — aimed at destabilising our societies and democratic processes. The more united and sovereign Europe is, the more it will be able to act as a driving force in the areas of human rights, global trade regulation, development cooperation and the fight against climate change. In doing so, it will also assert itself as a global model for its values and normative power.\n\nIn order to meet these five challenges, the Union must think strategically about its relationship with the rest of the world and quickly build the relationships that will flow from this strategic vision.\n\nDonald Trump’s second term as President of the United States renders obsolete the logic of relative sovereignty of the Union defended by some Member States due to the blows dealt to Atlanticism (both as a community of values and as a community of destiny). In the ongoing redistribution of power on a global scale, the Union must assert itself unwaveringly as a power that imposes itself by itself and for itself at the table of the American, Chinese and Russian powers. This requires, on the one hand, defining its strategic interests and, on the other, adopting the necessary means to defend them.\n\nSuch adoption also requires, without delay, a strengthening of its relationship with the countries of the South, foremost among which are the countries of Africa — the Global Gateway strategy launched in 2022 is a first step in this direction. It is time for the European Union and its Member States to embrace a common geopolitical ambition.\n\nThe Union must think strategically about its relationship with the rest of the world and quickly build the relationships that will result from this strategic vision.\n\nWhy should the Member States of the Union strive to build this European sovereignty? The answer is simple: for EU Member States, European sovereignty could be a tool for regaining their strategic autonomy – and therefore their national sovereignty – in key sectors such as security (military and human), energy independence, critical supplies, etc. European sovereignty will strengthen national sovereignties, rather than the opposite, in a context where Europe must face the imperialist ambitions of the world’s major powers. It is most likely on the condition of European sovereignty that the EU will continue its integration and, above all, convince in the years and decades to come.\n\nLet us remember one obvious fact: it is primarily the states that decide on European progress. Building European sovereignty requires Member States to accept ‘mutual dependencies’ in certain areas — to borrow the idea introduced by the 2013 French White Paper on defence and national security. This is particularly true in the area of military rearmament, where not only does no country in Europe have the means to build a completely autonomous defence, but also because we do not have to look far back in our history to understand the dramatic consequences of rearmament on the European continent. This is equally true in the areas of industrial policy and technological infrastructure. To paraphrase the 2013 White Paper, the aim is to organise discussions aimed at ‘replacing imposed dependencies with organised interdependencies, thereby reconciling sovereignty and mutual dependencies’ (which are mutually accepted).\n\nIn other words, building European sovereignty will not take away sovereignty from Member States: it will enable them to regain sovereignty in areas where they had, in fact, lost it. The history of the euro illustrates the dynamics that are likely to unfold. On paper, the euro deprived the states that adopted it of their monetary sovereignty, but in fact they had already been dispossessed of it in the 1990s by the deregulation of financial markets and speculative attacks on all European currencies, attacks that the introduction of the single currency helped to stop. The Greek crisis of the 2010s was extremely serious for the country and its inhabitants. But it also served as a stress test for the European Central Bank (ECB) and enabled the eurozone to reinvent itself. In July 2012, Mario Draghi, then head of the ECB, uttered the three words ‘Whatever it takes’, which saved the euro by putting an almost immediate end to market speculation. The post-2012 ECB created the European Stability Mechanism and the Single Resolution Fund, developed new tools, purchased government debt when necessary and, during the Covid-19 pandemic, circumvented its statutes to lend to governments.\n\nLet us remember one obvious fact: it is primarily the states that decide on European progress.\n\nConsequently, the decisive question that is now being asked of both the Union and its Member States is this: how much mutual dependence are you prepared to accept in order to guarantee the Union’s independence and build European power?\n\nEuropean citizens, for their part, currently express a very high level of confidence in the Union and its ability to defend Europe’s economic interests in the global economy. Measured by Eurobarometer 2024 at 51%, Europeans’ level of confidence in the EU has never been higher since 2007 — a figure that stands in stark contrast to the 33% confidence rating given to national governments. Support for the single currency has never been higher, either within the EU as a whole (74% of Europeans say they are in favour of the euro) or within the euro area (82% in favour). Finally, according to the results of Eurobarometer 2024, three out of four European citizens believe that the EU is more effective in defending the commercial interests of its Member States around the world than the Member States acting alone.\n\nIn March 2025, the major Eurobazooka survey commissioned by Le Grand Continent found that Europeans have more confidence in a common European army (60%) than in their national armies (19%) to ensure the security of their countries.\n\nNow outside the EU, the UK has, paradoxically, perhaps never been so close to Europe.\n\nAt a time when US President Donald Trump is proclaiming that the EU was created to ‘rip off’ his country, European citizens are affirming their confidence in the EU to defend their continent. The boundaries of this massive public support for Europe even extend beyond the borders of the EU, as the British appear to be moving further and further away from American public opinion. The United Kingdom is a close ally of the Union, sharing a community of values and providing essential support in the rearmament of its sovereignty. Now outside the Union, the United Kingdom has, paradoxically, perhaps never been so close to Europe.\n\nThe rearmament of European sovereignty can be achieved at high speed and within a constant – or almost constant – institutional framework, provided that the EU continues to demonstrate pragmatism and to speed up its decision-making processes when necessary.\n\nEnvisioning European sovereignty is a democratic challenge.\n\nEuropean citizens are calling for it.\n\nIn the new world order, it is more important than ever for governments to rise to the occasion.",

    "description": "Trump is having the government buy stakes directly in companies — and it's going to change the way we all do business and reshape the economy.",
    "fullText": "This is the first story in Business Insider's new series \"The Future of Capitalism.\" The series looks at ways Americans' confidence in capitalism has been eroding, and what related changes in our economy mean for your work and wealth.\n\nTo believe in American capitalism has long meant believing in a mostly laissez-faire approach from the government — it sets the rules of the game, but it doesn't have a piece on the board. Markets pick winners and losers, not Washington. The strong thrive, the weak fail. That consensus has been eroding for years, and finally, the dam has broken: The US government has become a shareholder in nearly a dozen companies over the past several months, and the list is growing. It's moved the economy into a much more interventionist — and unfamiliar — territory. The machine is still turning, but more hands are tinkering with the gears, including, most importantly, the president's.\n\nThe federal government has been on an equity stake shopping spree during the first year of Trump's second term. The US took a nearly 10% stake in Intel for $8.9 billion in August, a move aimed at bolstering the country's semiconductor industry. It has invested in several critical minerals firms, including MP Materials, Lithium Americas, and Trilogy Metals, as well as in Westinghouse, a nuclear energy company. In June, the administration acquired a \"golden share\" in US Steel in exchange for approving Japanese company Nippon Steel's acquisition of the company — it gives the government veto-like power over decisions such as shifting jobs outside the US and shuttering plants. (And as for recent developments in Venezuela, the president clearly is waving a heavy hand toward the US oil industry and potential investment there. How that situation plays remains to be seen.)\n\nThese types of moves are not abnormal outside the United States. China's version of capitalism is hyper-state-led. Many governments, including those of France, Italy, and the United Kingdom, make direct investments in some domestic firms. The US has gotten extra involved in private industry in the past, but it's generally been in times of distress, such as during the 2008 crisis, when it took stakes in certain financial institutions and automakers in order to prevent a broader economic meltdown.\n\nThis time, it's different: The government is meddling when there's no apparent urgent need, and it's picking companies in what some observers say is a scattershot manner. The sectors make sense, but the criteria for selecting companies are rather unclear, as is the role the government will play in its investments.\n\n\"With industrial policy, the devil's in the details of so much, and this is where the details are really obscured, and where they are defined, they're kind of ad hoc,\" says Nathan Lane, an assistant professor of economic development at the London School of Economics and Political Science.\n\nA novel vision of American state capitalism is emerging right before our eyes. It's a world where the White House puts its thumb on the scale, whether in injecting funds into a firm, weighing in on mergers, or implementing legally questionable tariffs at the drop of a hat. Many critics have expressed concerns about the risks arising from the Trump administration's actions — the potential for politically biased decision-making, the appearance of crony capitalism, and possible market distortions. In the grand scheme of things, these maneuvers may be financially minor, but they're structurally major developments. Regardless of the drawbacks, it's indicative of where we're headed. There may be no going back.\n\n\"The use of these tools generally only goes in one direction, and so the Trump administration, for better or worse, has introduced a new group of tools into the economic statecraft toolkit,\" says Aaron Bartnick, a former White House economic security official under the Biden administration and a current fellow at Columbia University. \"Whatever administration comes next, whether Republican or Democrat, will find it very tempting to continue to use them.\"\n\nThis hasn't all happened out of nowhere — the US has, for a decade, been increasingly comfortable with industrial policy, meaning the government taking a more active role in steering the economy. Trump 1.0 implemented several protectionist policies, including imposing tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, engaging in a trade war with China, and renegotiating the NAFTA trade agreement with Canada and Mexico. Rather than rolling everything back, Biden left in place many of Trump's tariffs, and his administration pushed in a state-nudged economic direction with the CHIPS Act, which was meant to support the US semiconductor industry, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, put tax credits and funds toward sectors such as electric vehicles and solar energy. And even prior to Trump and Biden, the government hasn't completely steered clear of steering the economy when needed. See: The New Deal and the aforementioned response to the financial crisis.\n\nStill, overall, the US has largely taken a hands-off approach to the economy over the last 40 years and been critical of countries that don't.\n\n\"The United States has spent decades tsk-tsking the rest of the world about state-owned enterprises and industrial policy and state capitalism,\" says Scott Lincicome, vice president of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. On the Trump administration's current about-face, \"the hypocrisy is pretty big,\" he says.\n\nThe latest turn is a significant step further. Instead of deploying a more typical playbook — grants, loans, tariffs, etc. — that can be seen as at least somewhat neutral in its application, the White House is now picking and choosing companies to get involved in. In broad strokes, one can see what they're getting at here. The companies on Trump's investment list are in important sectors where the US lags behind, and they fit into the president's overall theory of the case on the economy: it's better to have and make stuff here. Take Intel: The Trump administration wants to make sure the US is not reliant on semiconductor companies such as TSMC, which is based in Taiwan, since the island is vulnerable to China. It's a similar story with critical minerals companies, which mine, process, or refine materials crucial for a range of products, from smartphones to defense technology. Even some progressives see these as worthwhile endeavors. Sen. Bernie Sanders is into the Intel deal, telling Reuters in August that \"If microchip companies make a profit from the generous grants they receive from the federal government, the taxpayers of America have a right to a reasonable return on that investment.\"\n\nWhat some critics find head-scratching is why specific companies are being chosen. Why Intel in particular, and even more peculiarly, why a startup helmed by Intel's former CEO? On a macro level, the end goal may be the same as more typical industrial policy — supporting certain sectors — but it's being performed on a micro level. Trump has also been critical of policies with the same end in mind. Back in March, he told Congress to \"get rid of\" the CHIPS Act.\n\n\"It is fair to say that Intel has been underperforming, but I don't know of anyone who feels that if Intel continued to underperform, there was a risk of taking the entire technology sector down,\" Bartnick says. \"We haven't seen a rationale for how these particular companies were selected, how these particular industries were selected, how the valuations were reached.\"\n\nThe Trump administration may have determined that the US can't win its existential battle with China and protect its economic priorities with the regular tools in the toolbox. William Henagan, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, says those instruments have proven effective in the past because of the size of America's economy and the critical role the US dollar plays in global finance. The fact that the White House thinks throwing around our national weight is not enough to achieve their desired outcomes is an eyebrow-raising sign.\n\n\"We've basically been able to use restrictive enforcement tools to achieve international policy outcomes that we were interested in,\" Henagan says. \"Those are no longer sufficient.\"\n\nA White House official tells me there's \"very much\" a logic to what the administration is doing in taking equity stakes in strategic industries and sectors. \"The point with the equity stakes is that it's a tool that other countries have used with various degrees of success, but we're not indiscriminately trying to take equity stakes in everyone, in anything. We see it as a very powerful tool that we're using very judiciously in very specific sectors for very specific reasons,\" they say. Losing Intel, for example, would be an \"asymmetric blow\" to America's national and economic security.\n\nThe equity stakes are a \"rounding error\" compared with the trillions of dollars of GDP being affected by \"what are very unequivocally free-market or pro-capitalist policymaking\" activities, the official says, pointing to tax cuts and deregulation, among other moves. But they are an acknowledgment that the White House feels the free market has fallen short in shoring up these critical sectors.\n\nWhile the motivation for taking stakes in companies may be clear-ish, the execution is not, nor are the potential consequences.\n\n\"We know very little about the other rights that are associated with these deals,\" Bartnick says.\n\nIt's hard to predict exactly how the government will wield its equity-derived power. How will these stakes dilute the rights of existing shareholders? And what happens if the US government's interests don't align with those of other stockholders? Will the company feel compelled to follow through on what the government says, regardless? How exactly will the terms of these deals work? And even if the government doesn't use the hard power of its vote shares, it can use soft power to keep companies it's invested in from stepping out of line.\n\nThe federal government's Intel investment will be passive, meaning it gets no board representation or other governance rights, and it's agreed to vote with the company's board of directors — with limited exceptions. As part of the MP Materials agreement, the company isn't allowed to nominate any board members who are not US citizens without the Department of Defense's consent. However, the government will generally vote with the company's board, with exceptions.\n\nThe way American capitalism is generally supposed to work is that money flows to companies that are doing the best job of utilizing it. The whole idea is that market capital allocation is designed to separate the wheat from the chaff. These stakes may distort that — the government is choosing which specific firms it wants to come out ahead.\n\nWhat's more, if the federal government is going about throwing around money, rather than businesses focusing on making the best products and services possible, they may turn their attention to currying favor with the president. Whether or not this is crony capitalism or merely appears to be doesn't really matter. If executives make the calculation that it's much better to be on Trump's good side than his bad side, they may fall in line preemptively. The competition isn't for customers, market share, or innovation — it's for the president's affection.\n\nThe Trump administration doesn't want to be in the business of running private companies from the Oval Office, the White House official tells me, but the point is for the government to have some sway. \"Obviously, the intent wasn't for us to take an equity stake in Intel and then they just close down their Ohio foundry and ship it off to Taiwan,\" the official says. The hope is there's an \"overlap\" between what's best for companies and best for American economic national security.\n\nScott Kennedy, a senior advisor in Chinese business and economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, tells me that in an economy as vast and varied as America's, Washington's power is relatively limited, and this activity could be just a \"minor nuisance\" to industry. \"On the other hand, if there are more cases, then it will begin to affect the decision-making of businesses and will increasingly orient them to think about how they should do business in a way that benefits the current administration as opposed to what benefits their company or the US national interest,\" he says. \"And I think that that could have a distorting effect eventually.\"\n\n\"It's better if tech CEOs spend less time in DC and more time coming up with new products,\" says Owen Zidar, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University.\n\nNearly every analyst, economist, and academic I spoke to for this story agreed that Trump's version of American state capitalism is more a reflection of where the US is going than where it has been. It's not the same as what China's doing, and it's not socialism, but it's an unconventional step further down the road that the US has been on for a while.\n\nOn issues such as antitrust enforcement, industrial policy, and tariffs, factions within both the Republican and Democratic parties are leaning more towards interventionism. Trump is being more obvious with his actions and intentions — there's a reason Tim Cook is showing up in the Oval Office with a gold plaque. This is a situation where there's likely no backtracking. Other countries are reacting to America's inward turn as well — it's why Canada is shoring up its domestic economy, and Europe is taking a corporatist turn.\n\n\"It changes the political equilibrium in a way that other countries pursue similar policies. And we get away from the brand of capitalism that we were doing before,\" Lane says.\n\nIt's not a bad thing to look beyond the previous consensus. Capitalism is increasingly unpopular in America, especially among young people, for a reason. For many Americans, the system isn't working. Instead, it's breeding inequality, shipping jobs overseas, and making the overall economy more precarious. During the pandemic, the public got a front-row seat to the fragility of our supply chains and the risks associated with the just-in-time, globally distributed setup. Political leaders and policymakers aren't wrong to wonder if the state shouldn't take a heavier hand in shoring up important industries, supporting vital companies, and making investments where the private market might blanch at the risks.\n\nThe White House has indicated that more equity investments are likely on the horizon, but the criteria for who it will pick are a black box. \"We should entirely leave it up to the market to do whatever it wants\" is not a great approach to the economy. Neither is, \"Who gets a leg up depends on how the president's feeling today.\" It's odd for Trump to seize the means of production a little bit.\n\n\"We've had this sort of ideological view that's now breaking down a bit because we've realized that what we've been doing isn't good enough, isn't adequate enough,\" says Robert Atkinson, the founder and president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a tech and science policy think tank. \"I wish there was a sort of unified field theory for this in the Trump administration, but I don't think so.\"\n\nWhile the motives are understandable, the mechanics are anything but. It's unclear how the US will exit these investments, or, once it does, how much money it will actually make. However, in the context of the enormous federal budget, the return will be minimal. It pushes the global economy into new territory, and it's hard to know whether it's one the US will always like.\n\n\"We have spent decades, under both Democrats and even more so under Republicans, criticizing certainly China and Russia, but also Italy, Germany, and the UK on their use of these tools,\" Bartnick says. \"And if the US starts to go down that path as well, it will give not just our adversaries, but also our allies, even greater license to do the same.\"\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence won't be training AI anytime soon, says the CEO of a data labeling startup.\n\nOn an episode of the \"20VC\" podcast released last week, Matt Fitzpatrick, the CEO of Invisible Technologies, said that one of the biggest misconceptions in the AI training industry is that humans won't be needed in a few years.\n\n\"When I first started this job, the main push back I always got was that synthetic data will take over and you just will not need human feedback two to three years from now,\" said Fitzpatrick, who joined the startup last year. \"From first principles, that actually doesn't make very much sense.\"\n\nSynthetic data refers to data that is artificially created. It is used for training AI or machine learning models, mostly where real data is scarce or can't be used because of privacy concerns. Human feedback, on the other hand, asks real people to filter, rank, and train AI responses.\n\nOn the podcast, Fitzpatrick said that there are too many kinds of tasks for AI to accomplish in the world, and it would take a long time to do them accurately with language and cultural context in mind. For example, the legal industry contains vast amounts of nonpublic information.\n\n\"On the GenAI side, you are going to need humans in the loop for decades to come,\" he said. \"And I think that is something that most people are starting to realize.\"\n\nFitzpatrick was previously a senior partner at McKinsey, where he led QuantumBlack Labs, the firm's AI research and software development arm.\n\nInvisible, which raised $100 million in September at a $2 billion valuation, competes with data labeling companies such as Scale AI and Surge AI. These startups have raised billions in the past year as tech giants race to secure the data needed to train their AI models. They hire millions of human contractors, who help teach the models math, science, coding, and characteristics such as humor and empathy.\n\nFitzpatrick joins the CEOs of other data labeling startups in saying that the industry will continue to require human effort.\n\nIn September, the CEO of Mercor, Brendan Foody, said that the most important aspect of the business was data quality and \"having phenomenal people that you treat incredibly well.\"\n\nIn July, the CEO of Handshake, a job platform that pivoted into AI training last year, said that humans will still be needed to train AI, but who makes the cut is changing.\n\nGarrett Lord said the data annotation industry is shifting from requiring generalists to highly specialized experts, including in math and science.\n\n\"Now these models have kind of sucked up the entirety of the entire corpus of the internet and every book and video,\" Lord said on a podcast. \"They've gotten good enough where, like, generalists are no longer needed.\"",

    "description": "When student work looked like McKinsey memos, an NYU business school professor used AI oral exams to test real learning.",
    "fullText": "The assignments looked brilliant. The understanding didn't.\n\nThat's when an NYU business school professor decided to fight AI-assisted coursework with AI-powered oral exams.\n\nPanos Ipeirotis, a professor at NYU's Stern School of Business who teaches data science, wrote in a blog post published last week that he became concerned about student assignments that read like \"a McKinsey memo\" but lacked genuine understanding.\n\nWhen he called on students in class and asked them to defend their submissions, many struggled to do so.\n\n\"If you cannot defend your own work live, then the written artifact is not measuring what you think it is measuring,\" Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nTo counter that, he revived oral exams and enlisted an AI agent to administer them at scale, in an attempt to \"fight fire with fire.\"\n\n\"We need assessments that evolve toward formats that reward understanding, decision-making, and real-time reasoning,\" Ipeirotis said.\n\n\"Oral exams used to be standard until they could not scale,\" he added. \"Now, AI is making them scalable again.\"\n\nIn the blog post detailing the experiment, Ipeirotis said he and his colleague built the AI examiner using ElevenLabs' conversational speech technology.\n\n\"Just write a prompt describing what the agent should ask the student, and you are done,\" he said, adding that it took minutes to set up.\n\nThe oral exam had two parts. First, the AI agent questioned students about their capstone projects, probing their decisions and reasoning. Then it selected one of the cases discussed in class and pushed students to think through it live.\n\nOver the course of nine days, the system assessed 36 students. Each session lasted about 25 minutes, with total compute costs coming in at about $15 for all 36 students. A human-run oral exam could cost hundreds of dollars at teaching-assistant rates, Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nIpeirotis also used AI to grade the exams. Three AI models — Claude, Gemini, and ChatGPT — independently assessed each transcript. They then reviewed one another's evaluations, revised their scores, and produced a final grade, with Claude acting as the \"chair\" to synthesize the decision.\n\nIpeirotis said the \"council of LLMs\" graded more consistently than humans, and \"more strictly, but more fairly.\"\n\n\"The feedback was better than any human would produce,\" he wrote, adding that the AI analysis also surfaced gaps in how the material had been taught.\n\nHowever, students were divided. Only a small minority preferred the AI oral exams, and many found them more stressful than written tests — even while acknowledging they were a better measure of real understanding.\n\nStill, Ipeirotis said the oral exams demonstrated \"how learning is supposed to work.\"\n\n\"The more you practice, the better you get,\" Ipeirotis wrote.\n\nIpeirotis' blog post comes as universities grapple with how to test students in the AI era.\n\nA paper published in September in the academic journal \"Assessment & Evaluation in Higher Education\" said AI has turned student assessment into a \"wicked problem.\"\n\nThe study's authors interviewed 20 unit chairs at a large Australian university in late 2024. Through hourlong Zoom interviews, they found instructors to be overwhelmed by heavier workloads, confusion surrounding AI use, and a lack of agreement on what an AI-proof assessment should look like.\n\nSome faculty members told researchers that AI should be treated as a tool for students to master. Others view it as academic dishonesty that erodes learning. Many admitted they were unsure how to proceed.\n\nIn May, LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said on an episode of his podcast, \"Possible,\" that AI can make it easier for students to exploit traditional assessment formats, such as essays. Universities should rethink how they evaluate learning, he said, adding that students could soon expect an \"AI examiner.\"\n\nHoffman said that oral exams leave less room for shortcuts, requiring students to demonstrate real understanding.",

    "description": "Current and former Marine recruiters describe immense pressure to find enlistees. Amid the desperation, a culture of fraud bloomed in the Rust Belt.",
    "fullText": "Recruiting new Marines can be so challenging in parts of the US that some recruiters have resorted to fraud to meet their monthly goals.\n\nBusiness Insider obtained a 2023 Marine Corps investigation into one area of the Rust Belt that found widespread rule-breaking, including fabricated police records and fake medical notes. Two recruiters who were fired as part of the probe spoke to Business Insider about the pressures of recruiting and what drove them to fake records. One of them, Staff Sgt. Calvin Grimes, shared a collection of electronic templates that helped fellow recruiters forge doctors' notes, high school diplomas, and other documents.\n\n\"You have to live with that feeling that your heart's beating out of your chest ready to explode,\" former Gunnery Sgt. Logan Krivak said of falsifying records. \"You know it's wrong, and you just have to live with that.\"\n\nOverall, 10 Marines who recruited in the region between 2018 and 2024 told Business Insider they faced a desperate struggle to hit their quotas of signing up two new recruits each month. Five admitted to taking shortcuts or falsifying records. The others said they knew fraud was happening within recruiting ranks. In 2021, all the leaders in one recruiting hub were relieved for fraud, or for failing to catch it, sources told Business Insider.\n\nThe Rust Belt issues spotlight a problem that persists in some areas today, recruiters told Business Insider.\n\nFraudulent enlistment, or \"fraud,\" involves false claims in the recruiting process by a recruit or recruiter. It can include hiding the truth, forging a missing signature, fabricating official documents, or bypassing waivers.\n\nThese shortcuts can help recruiters avoid delays that could stop them from meeting their goals. But they carry risks: They can derail a recruit's career or jeopardize their health, and for recruiters, falsifying records is a violation of military law.\n\n\"It weighs on anybody who has a conscience,\" one current recruiter working in the Northeast said of such rule-breaking. \"You start walking that line into that gray area, and you have to figure out where your hard line is in the sand.\"\n\nThe 2023 investigation, being revealed for the first time by Business Insider, focused on the 4th Marine Corps District, which covers the Rust Belt and parts of Appalachia.\n\nIt was a tough region for recruiters to meet their monthly goal; then the pandemic hit, making it even more of a challenge, said Krivak, who recruited in the region from 2015 to 2018 and returned in 2020.\n\nHe said his first stint was brutal but survivable. He recalled regularly meeting his quotas, at times even exceeding them. Krivak said he never engaged in fraud on his first tour — his superiors rigorously condemned it. When he returned during the pandemic, motivated by the stability the job could provide, things had changed.\n\nA fresh source of stress was Military Health System Genesis, a newly rolled-out medical data system that flagged potential recruits' medical histories. The system halted processing for applicants with issues that could make service dangerous, such as asthma or heart problems. It also flagged seemingly minor problems — such as surgical scars or broken bones from a decade earlier, which tangled recruiters in a web of administrative roadblocks.\n\nIn the crunch to hit monthly recruiting quotas, recruiters like Krivak felt they couldn't afford to wait weeks for medical waivers that would override the Genesis flags. COVID had already restricted access to high schools, straining relationships with teachers and students, and making recruiting even more difficult. Krivak's territory proved dismal hunting grounds.\n\nEven solid candidates could present unexpected challenges, Krivak said. For example, he said, in areas riddled with drug problems, recruiters could struggle to get a teen's non-sober parent to sign off on enlistment.\n\nHe recalled being asked for a police document in 2022 to verify that an applicant's tattoos weren't gang-related. He said he was given several hours to obtain the document, and that the short timeline made it feel like he was expected to fake the document.\n\n\"That's not asking you to do this the right way,\" he said.\n\nKrivak forged the document, he said, arousing suspicion at a higher level upon inspection, the investigation found. Later relieved of duty and punished for the forgery, he ultimately left the Marine Corps.\n\nKrivak's forged document helped kick off a deeper examination into fellow recruiters, including Grimes, who maintained the electronic templates for falsifying documents.\n\nThe templates, which were referenced in the investigation, could be modified to create false hearing test results, high school diplomas, or doctors' notes clearing applicants of old medical issues. Grimes shared the templates with Business Insider.\n\nIn his statement for the 2023 investigation, Grimes said that he had been tacitly encouraged to engage in such deceit from his very first month on the job. He said a supervising recruiter told him, \"You have to do what you have to do to be successful.\"\n\nFor Grimes, who was also relieved of duty, fraudulent activity had become the norm, a response to what he and others described as dismal recruiting conditions exacerbated by the pandemic. Fraud, he said, was a way to process applicants faster and give exhausted and overworked subordinates a break.\n\n\"Talk to Grimes,\" some fellow recruiters would say when a tricky case needed help, Grimes and others recalled.\n\nBoth Grimes and Krivak now work in the private sector.\n\nFraud isn't ubiquitous across the Corps, recruiters said; it tends to be concentrated in areas where recruiting pressures are highest.\n\nSome current and former recruiters outside the Rust Belt told Business Insider that they had never witnessed fraud. Others said fraud has always existed, though only in small circles. All condemned it and agreed that most of the time, fraud involved shortcuts that didn't jeopardize health or safety.\n\nFraud only works with a level of plausible deniability, recruiters said, and must be tightly guarded. When others outside the circle, especially officers, get wind of it, things can unravel quickly. The Corps is swift to punish those who are caught.\n\nSome fraud, like a fudged signature or a fabricated diploma, is unlikely to harm an applicant's health. Rarer, more serious examples — which Grimes confessed to in the investigation and to Business Insider — risked putting a recruit's health in jeopardy, such as fake lung or heart health assessments.\n\nRecruiters told Business Insider that committing fraud left them with guilt, anxiety, and regret. Some described becoming numb to it, saying that shipping fraud-tinged applicants to boot camp earned them a pat on the back for helping their unit reach its goals. Other Marines who refused to engage in fraud said they struggled, facing pressure to succeed when others seemed to be cheating the system.\n\nGrimes and Krivak said they struggled to reconcile their punishment with the belief that their supervising officer knowingly allowed fraud to thrive — though the investigation disputes these beliefs.\n\n\"I think there is a cultural acceptance in some areas that is willing to sacrifice the Marine for the mission,\" when it comes to fraud, said a former recruiting supervisor who remains on active duty.\n\nA Marine Corps Recruiting Command spokesman told Business Insider that \"independent quality control\" checks throughout the enlistment process serve as guardrails to help mitigate fraud, along with a \"rigorous\" records review for recruits upon arrival at boot camp.\n\n\"The Marine Corps does not condone or allow fraud by Marines or by applicants seeking to enter the Marine Corps,\" the service told Business Insider. \"Those who violate ethical regulations or law are held to account.\"\n\nSome things have improved since the pandemic, insiders said, which has helped to alleviate pressure on recruiters. Over the last two years, MCRC underwent an overhaul, opening more hubs in the \"Southern Smile,\" like Florida and Texas, where a prevalence of young people means a broader pool of potential recruits.\n\nThe military has also streamlined the waiver process for Genesis, a spokesman said, acknowledging \"early implementation contributed to delays and uncertainty at a time when the recruiting environment was already under extraordinary pressure.\" Several current recruiters confirmed to Business Insider that the process has improved.\n\nRecruiters and their immediate supervisors — \"career recruiters\" who stay on the job after a yearslong appointment — told Business Insider that records fakery in one form or another is often still present in areas facing the toughest recruiting conditions — driven by pressure to succeed, meager recruiting pools, and above all, desperation and stress.\n\n\"You tell somebody, 'Hey, this is your job. And if you don't do it, your career's over.' There's a pressure there,\" said a former senior official, who likened it to quicksand drawing Marines into dark places.\n\n\"The answer that comes down from higher on how we are going to make mission is to do more prospecting and to find better qualified applicants like we used to before\" the pandemic, Grimes wrote in his statement as part of the 2023 investigation. The reason many recruiters engage in fraud, he said, is to reduce excess pressure. But such relief never came.\n\n\"The answer,\" he wrote, \"is always 'do more.'\"",

    "title": "Meet Dario Amodei, Anthropic's outspoken CEO",
    "description": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei doesn't seem to mind angering tech CEOs, whether it's with his warnings about AI or pushing export controls.",
    "fullText": "Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei doesn't mince words.\n\nHe's rankled some rival tech CEOs by boldly predicting that AI could wipe out half of entry-level, white-collar jobs and that the upheaval could happen between now and the next five years.\n\n\"I think at the end of the day, I warn about these things not to be a prophet of doom, but because warning about them is the first step towards solving them,\" Amodei said in December during The New York Times' DealBook Summit.\n\nAs 2025 comes to a close, Amodei still has a lot to warn about. By his own admission, the longtime AI researcher turned executive has said his vision for the future has led some to dismiss him as a \"doomer,\" even as he thinks AI could unlock a 150-year lifespan.\n\n\"Actual people who are building the technology, they're excited about the potential, but they're also worried,\" he said during the December event. \"They're worried about the national security risks. They're worried about alignment of the models; they're worried about the economic impacts of the models.\"\n\nUnder Amodei's leadership, Anthropic, once the underdog of the AI startups, is poised to remain a major part of the race.\n\nHere's a look at Amodei's life and career so far.\n\nDario Amodei was born in 1983 in San Francisco to Elena Engel and Riccardo Amodei. A few years later, his sister Daniela, who would later help him cofound Anthropic in 2021, followed. Engel worked on library renovation and construction projects. Amodei's father was a leatherworker raised in a small town near the Italian island of Elba.\n\nDespite growing up in what became Big Tech's cradle, Amodei said he was much more interested in hard sciences. His sister said Amodei's intelligence was apparent from an early age. She told Bloomberg that her brother would declare \"counting days,\" seeing how high he could go.\n\n\"It'd be like a whole day,\" she said. \"What kind of 3-year-old has that attention span?\"\n\nAfter attending Lowell High School, Amodei studied physics at Caltech before transferring to Stanford to complete his degree. He was pursuing a graduate degree at Princeton when Riccardo Amodei died from a rare illness. His father's death was a seminal moment, tech journalist Alex Kantrowitz wrote. Amodei shifted from studying theoretical physics to biophysics. Amodei told Kantrowitz that the survival rate of his father's illness improved rapidly in just a few years after his death.\n\nIt's a lesson that Anthropic's CEO said remains with him.\n\n\"I get really angry when someone's like, 'This guy's a doomer. He wants to slow things down,'\" Amodei told Kantrowitz, who writes the Big Techology newsletter. \"You heard what I just said, my father died because of cures that could have happened a few years [earlier]. I understand the benefit of this technology.\"\n\nIn 2011, Amodei obtained a Ph.D. in physics from Princeton. During postdoctoral research at Stanford, Amodei told Kantrowitz that he saw how artificial intelligence could help researchers like him tackle questions in biology that seemed \"beyond human scale.\" In 2014, Andrew Ng, a computer science professor at Stanford and cofounder of Coursera, recruited Amodei to join him at Baidu, a Chinese search engine.\n\nWhile working on speech recognition systems at Baidu, Amodei said he got the inclination of AI scaling, the theory that by increasing everything feeding into AI, the performance improves.\n\n\"I noticed that the models started to do better and better as you gave them more data, as you made the models larger, as you trained them for longer,\" Amodei told podcaster Lex Fridman in 2024. \"And I didn't measure things precisely in those days, but along with colleagues, we very much got the informal sense that the more data and the more compute and the more training you put into these models, the better they perform.\"\n\nElon Musk and Sam Altman, then friends, assembled a group of leading AI thinkers for a dinner at a Menlo Park hotel. Musk, Wired later reported, wanted to know if it was too late for a rival AI lab to rise to challenge Google, planting the seeds for what would become OpenAI.\n\nAmodei, who, according to Kantrowitz, was at the dinner, elected to join Google instead. While at Google, Amodei published well-regarded research laying out potential concerns for AI advancements. But after just 10 months at the tech giant, Amodei left for OpenAI.\n\nAt OpenAI, Amodei played a big role in the development of GPT-2 and 3, the startup's large language models. His experience galvanized his belief in the power of scaling, but it also reinforced he desire to tie AI advacements to safety.\n\n\"You don't tell the models what their values are just by pouring more compute into them,\" Amodei told Fortune in 2023. \"And so there were a set of people who believed in those two ideas.\"\n\nOver time, Amodei said he lost faith that OpenAI's leaders shared his beliefs. In 2020, after rising to become OpenAI's vice president of research, Amodei quit.\n\nThe breakup remains a major point of conversation around Silicon Valley.\n\nDuring the December event, Amodei took multiple perceived swipes at Altman, even as he repeatedly refused to directly name OpenAI's CEO.\n\nAmodei said that Anthropic was cautiously trying to thread the needle between the enormous investment required for data center construction and the risk of overextending itself. In contrast, he said others in AI are \"yoloing and who pull the risk dial too far.\"\n\nThe most clear potential shot at Altman came after Amodei was asked about the OpenAI CEO's decision to declare a \"code red\" to employees amid fears that ChatGPT was losing its edge.\n\n\"We have a little bit of a privileged position where we can just keep growing and just keep developing our models, and we don't have to do any code reds,\" Amodei said.\n\nWith seven other former OpenAI employees, Amodei cofounded Anthropic in 2021. It was a close-knit group. One of the cofounders, Daniela Amodei, is Dario's sister. Some of them had even roomed together, dating back to their time in a shared house when they all worked at OpenAI.\n\nInside Silicon Valley, there were doubts that a new startup could catch up to OpenAI. Just over two years in, Anthropic reached unicorn status.\n\nAmodei told Time Magazine that by the summer of 2022, Anthropic had finished training its chatbot, Claude. However, the company held back from releasing it. OpenAI, Amodei's now-rival, released ChatGPT months later.\n\n\"I suspect it was the right thing to do,\" Amodei told the magazine in 2024, when Time named Anthropic one of its most influential companies and put him on the cover. \"But it's not totally clear-cut.\"\n\nAnthropic launched Claude almost a year after ChatGPT's release. The startup's bot still won praise. Over time, it has built up a devoted following, particularly for its coding ability.\n\nUnlike OpenAI, Anthropic is largely devoted to businesses and not consumer AI. In May, Reuters reported that Anthropic is making $3 billion in annualized revenue, a significant jump.\n\nIn 2025, Amodei, his sister Daniela, and the rest of the cofounders were all minted billionaires based on the company's valuation. Forbes estimates that Amodei is worth roughly $3.7 billion, as of mid-December.\n\nAmodei said that Anthropic's focus on enterprise clients has created a \"durable\" revenue stream with \"better margins\" than competitors who are more focused on consumer products.\n\n\"We're trying to manage that risk well while also buying an amount of compute that allows us to be competitive with the other players,\" he said during the December event. \"We're very efficient in training, we're very efficient in inference. We have good margins. I think we can manage it. I think the odds are on our side.\"\n\nIn November, Anthropic announced it would spend $30 billion on Microsoft Azure compute, a deal that also positioned it as the first model to be available on the three largest clouds. As part of the agreement, Anthropic is set to receive up to $5 billion from Microsoft and up to $10 billion from Nvidia.\n\nAmodei later said that partnering with Nvidia hasn't changed his view that its CEO Jensen Huang is mistaken in his view that US companies should sell advanced chips to China.\n\n\"This isn't personal, this is a policy question,\" Amodei said. \"This is a question of how best to defend our national security.\"\n\nOther views have also put Amodei up against his competitors and even the White House. In October, AI czar David Sacks, accused Anthropic of \"running a sophisticated regulatory capture strategy based on fear-mongering.\" Amodei said that Sacks' claims were \"inaccurate.\"\n\nNotably, Amodei has not changed his opposition to a White House-favored federal preemption of state-level AI laws. Some Republicans in Congress have attempted to pass a 10-year moratorium into law, although the policy has split even within their own party.\n\n\"It's like saying, I'm driving a car, I'm going to rip out the steering wheel because I don't need to steer for 10 years,\" Amodei said in December.",

    "description": "Maddy Zhang spent over four years at Google. She shared five tips for getting into Big Tech, from referrals to technical interviews.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech can seem impenetrable. This Google alum has some tips for getting your foot in the door.\n\nMaddy Zhang spent over four years working as a software engineer for Google, touching both the search and advertising businesses. She now works at Airbnb, per her LinkedIn, and previously held internships at Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft.\n\nOn the \"A Life Engineered\" podcast, Zhang shared five tips for landing a job at Google or one of its competitors.\n\nFirst, she recommended applying to jobs early — as in, within hours of the openings being posted.\n\n\"Because there's so much competition, it's honestly an employer's market,\" Zhang said. \"If you wait a day, probably there's going to be hundreds of applicants for it.\"\n\nWhile the recruiter is supposed to look at all of the applications, they'll likely look at the first batch and ignore the rest, she said.\n\nApplying quickly can help you land a job, LinkedIn data shows. Responding quickly helps too: US job seekers who reply to a prospective employer's message within 24 hours are 4.1 times as likely to get hired and 6.7 times as likely to get an interview, according to Indeed.\n\nNext, she advised getting referred by a current employee. Zhang's friends who have applied with referrals had a higher success rate, she said. But that doesn't mean ask anyone on LinkedIn to support you.\n\n\"If you don't actually have a connection with them, it's not going to help,\" she said.\n\nWhile a good résumé or referral might get you through the recruiter's initial pass, applicants must then pass a technical interview. Many engineers prepare using LeetCode — a tool Zhang said was still valuable.\n\n\"I know no one really likes it,\" she said. \"It's a necessary evil.\"\n\nZhang recommended doing a mix of easy, medium, and hard LeetCode problems. When you get stuck, she advised not just looking at the answer, but retyping and running the solution.\n\nIt's easy to think that Google is filled to the brim with Stanford graduates. That wasn't Zhang's experience, though. Her next piece of advice: Don't underestimate yourself based on your school.\n\nMost of Zhang's friends didn't go to \"good computer science schools,\" she said. Many attended state schools or community colleges before transferring.\n\n\"As you progress forward in your career, your school matters less and less,\" she said.\n\nEven with the best application, interview prep, and referrals, there's no guarantee of a job. That's Zhang's final piece of advice: remember it's a numbers game.\n\nZhang said that she had been rejected hundreds of times. When she was younger, those rejections made her want to give up on the industry. She's since learned that it's not personal.\n\n\"Maybe I had a bad day, maybe the interviewer had more qualified candidates, maybe there's something I couldn't control,\" Zhang said.\n\n\"Rejection is nothing on who you are as a software engineer.\"",

    "description": "Bill Harris, a 69-year-old startup founder and the former CEO of PayPal and Intuit, says a midday nap and index cards help him get through the day.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Bill Harris, the 69-year-old startup founder of Evergreen Wealth and former CEO of PayPal and Intuit, based in Miami. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI'm the founder and CEO of Evergreen Wealth, an RIA registered investment advisory. We provide our largely high-net-worth clients with investment management and financial advice, using AI to enhance our services.\n\nI spent a decade in media in New York and then a decade in corporate fintech in California, where I served as the CEO of PayPal and Intuit (now TurboTax).\n\nThen, I spent a 25-year stint in fintech startups, with seven successes and two failures, all of which ultimately led to Evergreen Wealth in 2023.\n\nSimplicity has become one of the most important things to me. When I was married and raising kids in Silicon Valley, my days were a jumble of competing obligations. Now, I live alone in a 1,200-square-foot cottage in Miami Beach with no car. The simplicity of not having anything else that commands my attention is remarkably liberating.\n\nThough I'm 69, I haven't retired because this remains the most engaging thing I do. If and when I retire, I plan to attend the University of Cambridge as a student.\n\nHere's what a day in my life is like.\n\nI wake up when my body is ready, typically around 6 or 6:30. It might be five or 10 minutes before I hop out of bed and check email quickly to see if there's anything hot.\n\nIf not, I stay off the machine unless I've got something on deadline. I get dressed, check the tires on my bike, and organize my belongings. While I'm doing those somewhat mindless tasks, I let myself think.\n\nSomething happens first thing in the morning, where all the unraveled pieces of information from the night before feel ready to be integrated. It's a remarkably productive period of time for me to find clarity, think broadly, and process.\n\nI don't eat breakfast, and I don't shower at home, because I bike 30 minutes to work and have a shower at my office.\n\nI hit the office around 7:30 or 8 a.m. Before the pandemic, we had over 20 people in the office; now, most of our staff work from home or are hybrid. Unless I'm out of town, I go to the office every day.\n\nAfter taking a shower, I switch gears from undisciplined thoughts to the highest-priority task of the day, whether that's creating a presentation, building a spreadsheet, or simply writing.\n\nI'm not the type to be super regimented, and I'm not very good at time management. I run a whole lot more on enthusiasm than discipline.\n\nI keep track of everything throughout the day by using index cards. I scribble down words, little pictures, reminders, charts, or whatever else I need to remember. It's a fast and flexible way for me to stay organized.\n\nMy enthusiasm keeps me going most of the time, but it's not infrequent that, in the afternoon, I start dragging. I feel it physically, as if magnets are pulling me down.\n\nIf I can, I'll take a nap in the cot I've set up in my closet. Sometimes I look for a hole in the schedule, or I just cancel things. I let my body take control and don't set an alarm.\n\nEveryone knows I nap. I used to stick a Post-it on the closed door, saying \"The old man is sleeping.\"\n\nMy naps bring back that energy and enthusiasm that drives me.\n\nI don't consume caffeine. I have the willingness to let my body tell me when it's ready to rest. Occasionally, I'll miss something during a nap and think, \"Oh my, that's embarrassing,\" but I don't have a fear of missing something important.\n\nLunch is my first meal of the day, often soup, because it's just so easy and convenient. I almost exclusively drink carbonated water from my SodaStream, and I drink from glass bottles to avoid microplastics.\n\nThe first thing I do when I get home is prepare some food, which involves less cooking and more chopping and combining ingredients. I've actually never even opened my oven before.\n\nMy favorite foods are eggs, avocados, salmon, legumes, and a variety of fruits and vegetables. I try to avoid eating processed foods.\n\nI don't own a TV or use social media, but I spend too much time on YouTube. I enjoy watching videos while I eat dinner.\n\nI watch content from Peter Zeihan for geopolitics, Tim Miller for politics, Sam Harris for philosophy (sort of), Sabine Hossenfelder for physics, Lex Friedman for science and AI, and Josh Johnson for fun.\n\nIf I have some time, I might also read.\n\nIf I still have energy, I'll dedicate another hour or two to work. I also review my index cards from the day, and if there's anything still unfinished or important enough to track, I add it to my task list, which is an Excel sheet I've had for years. There must be over 10,000 entries by now.\n\nHaving such a big list isn't terrifying; it's reassuring. What terrifies me is losing track of something. If everything gets logged, I have the satisfaction of knowing that I didn't forget about it; it's just not at the top of my priority list.\n\nThen I'll get into bed, and the last thing I do before I go to sleep is put on an eye mask so I don't wake up to the morning light if it's before my body is ready.\n\nOn weekends, I try to eat well and go out to places where the food is excellent. Like the weekdays, I ride my bike for at least an hour each day.\n\nI also enjoy going out dancing to live music. It could be jazz, deep house, rock, or pop. I just love the feeling of being in a live music session with other people and everybody moving. I love rhythmic motion.",

    "title": "Read the emails an AI startup founder sent Mark Cuban before securing his investment",
    "description": "An AI startup founder successfully pitched Mark Cuban via email. Here's what the entrepreneur wrote to the billionaire before he decided to invest.",
    "fullText": "Startup founder Adam Joseph has never appeared on \"Shark Tank,\" but he knows how it feels to be on the hot seat in front of Mark Cuban.\n\nJoseph managed to get Cuban's attention and an investment in his AI-powered PR agency, Clipbook, through a series of emails.\n\nThe seven-figure investment that Joseph secured started 12 months ago with cold outreach to a few famous investors, including Cuban, who has said he spends his days reading and responding to emails.\n\nJoseph shared highlights from his email exchange with Cuban exclusively with Business Insider. These emails show how Cuban responds to startup founders, assesses business pitches, and decides to invest over email, as the billionaire has said he's done many times.\n\n\"I wanted to put a potential seed opportunity that I think might be a strong mutual fit,\" Joseph wrote in his initial message to Cuban.\n\nThe Clipbook founder then provided a bullet-point summary of his startup, which uses AI to track how people and companies are being discussed online, like a more sophisticated version of Google Alerts. Joseph worked in PR for a few years and said he felt the \"pain points\" of keeping tabs on public sentiment, which he thought AI could help solve. When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, Joseph said it became \"immediately obvious\" that AI could transform PR.\n\nCuban didn't respond to Joseph's pitch right away. The next day, the entrepreneur followed up, adding that he's backed by Dan Pfeiffer, co-host of the popular politics show \"Pod Save America.\"\n\nThat same day, Cuban responded. He requested a sample report for his own name to demonstrate the tech in action. He also asked how Clipbook differed from Google Alerts and wanted to know what the founder was seeking from him — and under what terms. From there, Joseph and Cuban traded a few more emails and hopped on a call. Soon after, they reached a deal, Joseph said.\n\n\"It moved more aggressively and faster with Mark than I expected,\" Joseph later said in an interview with Business Insider.\n\nJoseph said Cuban vetted him, not just the business.\n\n\"He was just really doing a 360, just pressure-testing the business,\" Joseph said. \"But I think more importantly, probably, pressure-testing me as an entrepreneur. So the fact that he had come in pretty hot with some pretty aggressive questions I think was also really — it was really, actually, in retrospect, a really positive signal that he was very interested in the deal.\"\n\nBelow are email exchanges between Joseph and Cuban, which Joseph shared with Business Insider. Cuban gave Business Insider permission to publish their content. The original text and formatting have been preserved, with small modifications for clarity. Certain sensitive information, like email addresses and Clipbook's revenue, has been redacted.",

    "fullText": "Dating apps, AI social networks, drama-clad \"tea\" apps — you name it, I've downloaded it.\n\nIn 2025, I tested out dozens of apps on my phone while reporting on social media for Business Insider.\n\nLike many other internet dwellers, a majority of my time was spent on apps like TikTok, Instagram, and YouTube.\n\nWhile some of the biggest splashes on the app charts were AI apps like OpenAI's Sora or Meta's stand-alone AI app — and I tested out both — these felt more like blips in the fast-churning digital trend cycle.\n\nInstead, I found myself frequently opening a small handful of apps that feel like an escape from the social media feeds of endless content and AI slop.\n\nHere are the apps I'm using, revisiting, and keeping an eye on as 2026 begins.\n\nMy go-to social media platform may not be on your radar, but it should be.\n\nRetro, a photo-sharing app that's focused on smaller-scale sharing for friends and family, remains one of my most-used apps since I first downloaded it in 2023. Founded by former Instagram employees, the app is where I now post my photo dumps to a small circle of about 15 friends. It recently launched a feature that lets you rewind through your old photos every week, making a supercut of memories.\n\nTwo other alternative social media apps I've been returning to are PI.FYI and Airbuds. PI.FYI, a social network from the popular culture newsletter Perfectly Imperfect, has become a tool for me to find new music, movies, and recommendations for just about anything. Meanwhile, Airbuds, a social app that shows you what music your friends are listening to, is where I turn when I'm on the hunt for new things to listen to.\n\nIf I'm making plans with friends, I'm opening Corner. The social map app has been around for a few years now, but relaunched this year with new AI-powered search tools designed with Gen Z in mind to help find nearby restaurants, bars, or shops.\n\nOne legacy social media platform that returned to my thumb-clicking rotation is Pinterest. The mood-boarding platform has undergone many changes since its new CEO, Bill Ready, took over in 2022. Search and shopping features now dominate the app, which, for me, is exactly what I come there for. I'm opening Pinterest when I am brainstorming what to wear or how to decorate a room in my apartment. Often, I'm saving things that I may want to buy later on.\n\nPinterest isn't entirely an escape from AI, however. A lot of its tools use AI, and the platform has rolled out features that attempt to give users more control over how much AI-generated content they see on the app.\n\nDanger Testing, a project by Carlos Mayers and Marc Mueller, has minted a handful of apps in the last year and describes itself as \"dropping apps like songs.\"\n\nOne app was essentially a virtual Labubu, while another let you digitally vandalize a Friend AI poster. A recent release, called \"My Brainrot,\" turns any video on your phone into a TikTok-style meme with an automated caption.\n\nIn the era of vibe coding, the apps coming from Danger Testing remind me of the silliness of early mobile apps, like the good old iBeer — just made more swiftly and with a pinch of irony for the chronically online.\n\nThere are a lot of apps I'll be trying out this year, and I'm sure a bunch of those will be even more dating apps touting AI as the solution for finding love. Otherwise, I'm still on the hunt for the next social network that'll stick, tools that help people get offline and into the real world, or creative ways to use AI.",

    "fullText": "Deborah Carrillo made a classic lawyer pivot. After a decade at a white-shoe firm, she left to join one of her clients, the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures.\n\nWhat came next is far less common. Menlo has elevated Carrillo, its general counsel and only in-house lawyer, to partner after nearly six years with the firm — a rare distinction inside a venture fund.\n\nCarrillo's promotion suggests the role of the legal department is shifting in the venture industry. Carrillo said she's at the table for weekly partner meetings where they pitch deals and bat around ideas.\n\n\"My voice is valued,\" she said.\n\nLawyers who go in-house often swap the prestige of firm life for steadier hours and a different kind of influence. At venture firms, general counsels typically haven't been on a path to ownership. Carrillo's new title puts her closer to the upside, giving her a larger claim on future profits.\n\nMenlo Ventures is one of the oldest investment shops in Silicon Valley, with $6.8 billion in assets under management. It backed Anthropic early on and counts Lovable, Chime, and Carta among its breakout investments.\n\nOther firms that have granted the partner title to general counsels over the years include Lightspeed and Bessemer Venture Partners.\n\nBefore joining Menlo, Carrillo was a partner at the New York law firm Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, where she advised startups and venture firms. She previously taught math in public schools.\n\nAs the firm's one-person legal shop, Carrillo helps structure investments and funds and keeps the machinery of compliance running smoothly.\n\nIncreasingly, that means translating geopolitics into go or no-go calls: flagging risks that could trigger blowback from the government, and, amid new federal restrictions on foreign investments, digging into whether a portfolio company's ownership traces back to Chinese nationals.\n\n\"I help people make the best decision and execute on those decisions,\" Carrillo said.\n\nCarrillo's advice for young lawyers looking to make a move in-house: \"Follow people and follow joy.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Jason Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business executives and founders, is swapping out human workers for AI.",
    "fullText": "Jason Lemkin, known to some as the Godfather of SaaS, says the time has come to push the limits of AI in the workplace.\n\nIn practice, Lemkin, the founder of SaaStr, the world's largest community of business-to-business founders, said on Lenny's Podcast recently that this means he will stop hiring humans in his sales department.\n\nInstead, SaaStr is going all in on agents, which are commonly defined as virtual assistants that can complete tasks autonomously. They break down problems, outline plans, and take action without being prompted by a user.\n\nHe said the company now has 20 AI agents automating tasks once handled by a team of 10 sales development representatives and account executives.\n\nThat move from an entirely human workforce to an agent-based workforce was rapid.\n\nIn May, SaaStr had just one AI agent in production that it used for various digital tasks, Lemkin said. That month, though, during the SaaStr Annual — its yearly gathering of over 10,000 founders, executives, and VCs — two of its high-paid sales representatives abruptly quit.\n\nLemkin said he turned to his chief AI officer and said, \"We're done with hiring humans in sales. We're going to push the limits with agents.\"\n\nLemkin's calculus was that it just wasn't worth the cost of hiring another junior sales representative for a $150,000 a year position who would eventually quit, when he could use a loyal AI agent instead.\n\nAmelia Lerutte, SaaStr's chief AI officer, told Business Insider by email that by June, the company began ramping up the number of agents it had in production.\n\n\"We had only 1 non-core agent at the time with Delphi, but didn't go deep on 2 to 20+ until the beginning of June,\" she said. \"It was a conscious choice after their departure to reallocate some (but not all) head count spend to agents.\"\n\nAt the SaaStr office, the 10 desks that once belonged to humans on the go-to-market team are now labeled with the names of agents, like \"Quali for qualified,\" \"Arty for artisan,\" and \"Repli for Replit,\" Lemkin said.\n\nLemkin said SaaStr is training its agents on its best humans.\n\n\"Train an agent with your best person, and best script, then that agent can start to become a version of your best salesperson,\" he said.\n\nSaaStr's process is similar to how Vercel, the cloud-based platform for developers, trained a sales agent off its top performer for six weeks by documenting every step of their work, and then building an agent to mimic their process.\n\nMany companies are experimenting with AI agents, but risks remain. One of the big ones is the threat of data leaks and cybercrime.\n\n\"AI agents, in order to have their full functionality, in order to be able to access applications, often need to access the operating system or the OS level of the device on which you're running them,\" Harry Farmer, a senior researcher at the Ada Lovelace Institute, recently told Wired.\n\nAll of that access creates more potential attack points for cybercriminals.\n\nSecurity threats aside, Lemkin said that the net productivity of agents is about the same as humans. However, he said, agents are more efficient and can scale — just like software.",

    "fullText": "Software engineering is changing — and we want to hear from those navigating the moment.\n\nProgrammers today find themselves with a whole new suite of AI tools, from Claude Code to Cursor to Codex. These editors enable engineers to generate entirely artificial lines of code or modify their handwritten code with the assistance of a large language model.\n\nThere's a term for this type of AI-assisted programming: \"vibe coding.\"\n\nEngineers from Meta to Google are embracing a vibe coding approach in their day-to-day work. Everyone, from teenagers to non-technical workers, suddenly seem to be building their own apps — or at least vibe-coding their way to a prototype.\n\nIt's a whole new skill set for engineers to learn, though, one that can vary from tool to tool. (Replit is different from Lovable, which is different from Bolt, and the list goes on.) It's also not clear, for the most experienced programmers, whether there are actually productivity gains.\n\nAndrej Karpathy coined the famous term \"vibe coding\" early last year. He was a founding team member of OpenAI and led AI efforts at Tesla. In a recent X post reflecting on the field, Karpathy wrote that he had \"never felt this much behind as a programmer.\"\n\n\"I have a sense that I could be 10X more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last ~year,\" he wrote. \"A failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like skill issue.\"\n\nAre you a programmer?

    "description": "Now run by Ravi Singh, the $1.5 billion manager is looking to grow.",
    "fullText": "The last 18 months have been Paloma Partners' second attempt at reinventing itself.\n\nThe first try began in May 2023. Billionaire Donald Sussman, the founder of the 44-year-old asset manager famous for seeding D.E. Shaw and other quant funds, decided his firm needed a shake-up and hired well-known investor Neil Chriss as the firm's CEO. Less than a year later, however, Chriss was out, and the firm was facing significant redemptions as 2024 came to a close.\n\nNow, with former Goldman Sachs partner and Credit Suisse executive Ravi Singh installed as CEO and longtime WorldQuant executive Mike DeAddio as COO, the $1.5 billion firm believes it can reestablish its reputation in the industry as a destination for top investors thanks to talent-friendly terms and rebuilt infrastructure.\n\n\"It's been a hell of a year,\" said Singh in a recent interview at the firm's midtown Manhattan offices. Through the middle of December, Paloma had returned roughly 9% in 2025, a person close to the firm said, after gains of just 2.5% in 2024. The manager declined to comment on performance.\n\nPaloma is looking to fundraise and diversify further beyond its systematic trading roots. Among the firm's latest investments are Avicene Asset Management, a long-short equity fund launching in early 2026 from Moiz Khan, a former investor within Citadel's Surveyor unit, and Jay Kaplan, an internal portfolio manager focused on IPOs. Singh said Paloma is \"agnostic\" about whether portfolio managers would run money internally on Paloma's platform or externally at their own firms.\n\n\"We're competing against everyone\" for talent, Singh said, and Paloma has plans to get bigger in every facet.\n\nDespite the firm's recent turbulence, the Paloma name still carries weight in the quant community.\n\n\"I always heard legendary stories about Paloma,\" said JB Kim, the founder of quant fund nVerses, which manages capital from the firm. A backer of D.E. Shaw, Nassim Taleb's now-shuttered Empirica Capital, and LMR, Sussman, in particular, is held in high esteem among the systematic community.\n\nBut Singh and DeAddio want talented PMs in other asset classes as well. The multistrategy fund aims to be split equally between fundamental stockpickers, systematic traders, and credit funds, Singh said, and the manager has also added a few volatility traders to diversify the return stream.\n\nOne of the firm's best bets in recent years is London-based credit fund Sona Asset Management, which has surged to more than $15 billion in assets after originally launching with an SMA from Paloma.\n\nPaloma's top three executives, along with Sussman, who is now the chairman, make up the office of the CIO, and they've defined the type of investor they're looking for as \"established emerging managers.\" Strategies that require years of work before they can begin trading, Singh said, are not wanted, but the firm is willing to be more flexible on risk than others in the industry.\n\n\"This model has supported a strong track record of successful launches and reinforced our reputation as a founder-friendly capital partner,\" Singh said.\n\nThe investors they're seeking are tired of one-size-fits-all platforms and often run more constrained strategies. Both internal PMs and external fund managers own their intellectual property and track record, Singh added.\n\nAs the $5 trillion hedge fund industry deals with an ongoing talent war, Singh said the model the firm has used to recruit and retain talented investors is \"high-touch.\" Paloma, he said, will likely never grow to be hundreds of investing teams like Millennium or Citadel — the firm doubled its investor head count in 2025 to roughly 25 portfolio managers — but can continue to add the right kind of investors for their model.\n\nThese PMs are likely more tenured in their careers and not looking to jump to whichever fund is offering the highest guaranteed payout at the time. Singh said the firm is keeping a close eye on costs and avoiding bidding wars for PMs.\n\nInstead, the \"high-touch\" model is defined by a close working relationship with Singh, DeAddio, and the firm's chief risk officer, Grant Rippetoe, that can be more customized to the individual PM.\n\nKim, the founder of nVerses, who started his firm in 2021 with capital from Millennium before Izzy Englander's firm redeemed its money, said he communicates with DeAddio every day and was able to start trading four months after getting Paloma's capital, a remarkably fast timeframe for a systematic strategy.\n\nHow big the firm grows its asset base is still undetermined. What is known is the ability of the firm's current roster of investors to handle more capital.\n\n\"Our talent pipeline and embedded manager capacity is multiples of our current capital base,\" Singh said.\n\nPaloma could get as large as $4 billion without needing to add investing personnel, the person close to the firm said.\n\nIf the manager were to continue to add assets beyond that mark, the head count would likely need to expand, but Paloma's leadership believes its newly built infrastructure is able to scale quickly and efficiently.\n\nDeAddio said that more investing teams allow the capital efficiency of portfolio building to really shine because of the added diversification. In other words, the multistrategy style of investing is one where sufficient scale matters.\n\nWhile plenty has changed in recent years about Paloma, including most of the staff now shifting to the firm's Manhattan offices from its Greenwich headquarters, Sussman recently wrote to investors that plenty of core tenets are unchanged and will not be altered in the expansion.\n\n\"As we complete a comprehensive restructuring and modernize our technology stack, two foundational elements remain unchanged: our focus on risk-managed, uncorrelated return streams and our role as a preferred partner for exceptional talent,\" he wrote.\n\n\"In a highly competitive landscape, we continue to attract top-tier managers who value institutional alignment and the ability to scale in a disciplined way.\"",

    "description": "Entrepreneurs and tech workers from around the world describe how they navigated the many cloud outages in 2025.",
    "fullText": "November 18 was supposed to be a routine workday for Rwanda-based entrepreneur Derrick Ikenga. But it turned out to be a nightmare he wasn’t prepared for.\n\nCloudflare, a U.S.-based cloud services and cybersecurity firm, faced a massive global outage that day, taking down large parts of the internet, including operations of giants like X (formerly Twitter) and ChatGPT.\n\nIkenga’s company, which builds sales automation tools for clients, also uses Cloudflare. The outage brought the tools to a grinding halt, sending his clients into panic mode.\n\nFor many entrepreneurs and tech workers, this was a familiar experience in 2025. Today, an estimated 94% of enterprise services worldwide rely on at least one major cloud provider, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud, for hosting, data storage, or delivery. Together, the three largest providers control more than 62% of the global cloud market.\n\nBetween August 2024 and August 2025, AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud together experienced more than 100 service outages. The duration of these outages varied between a few minutes and several hours. AWS saw one of the biggest and most widespread cloud outages of 2025 when its services went down for 15 hours in October. The outage affected over 4 million users and more than 1,000 companies.\n\nWhen an outage occurs, cloud service providers are responsible for restoring services as soon as possible. In some cases, providers compensate affected customers with free cloud credit.\n\nEach time such disruptions occurred, everyday moments began to fail in unexpected ways. Online payments failed. Doctors were unable to access patients’ health records. CCTV cameras went offline. Doorbells stopped working. Smart mattresses lost their sleep-tracking features.\n\nThe outage offered a glimpse into just how deeply cloud infrastructure is woven into modern life, powering everything from bank transfers to flight bookings and movie streams.\n\nRest of World brings together first-person accounts from entrepreneurs and technology workers around the world, tracing what happened when the cloud failed in 2025.\n\nThe quotes have been edited for length and brevity.\n\nFrancisco Osorio, a Mexico-based senior go-to-market marketing engineer at Simetrik, an operational control and management automation company\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless.\n\nI am responsible for the smooth functioning of my company’s website, among other things. During the November AWS outage, the website stopped functioning, but I was unable to take any action because I lost access to all my work-related platforms, like HubSpot, Slack, and Salesforce. [Some users of AWS experienced issues on November 5, according to outage tracking website Downdetector.com. An AWS spokesperson denied the claims in comments to Reuters.]\n\nEven as we were sorting through internal issues, our clients also couldn’t log into the platform, which was a more serious concern because we need to comply with service level agreements under which we assure quality and quantity of service.\n\nI couldn’t do anything other than feel helpless. All I could tell everyone around was, “I’m deeply sorry, I cannot help you today. Our platforms are not running.”\n\nSundeep Narwani, India-based co-founder of Narrative Research Labs, a firm focusing on AI in media\n\nBeing an AI company, we’re quite heavily dependent on the cloud. The outages have wasted a lot of time for our clients and us, rendering us helpless in most cases.\n\nThe outages have wasted a lot of our time.\n\nThe first time it happened, we didn’t know what to do or how to deal with it, and we entered panic mode. My biggest concern was on two fronts: downtime disrupting our processes, and our clients being obviously very angry because we deliver a lot of daily reports for them.\n\nWhen it happened the second time, we created a standard operating procedure to deal with it because someone like me, who is involved in business development apart from being the CEO, cannot be available all the time to handle these issues.\n\nWe delegate a project manager to handle issues of cloud outages and ensure our customers are taken care of during such times while finding a quick solution to the downtime.\n\nWe have also purchased a local server to replicate what AWS does, so that if there is any kind of outage again, we have one local server to tide us over. Obviously, it doesn’t have the same kind of performance that AWS gives us, but at least the team can function. But these are just temporary options.\n\nDavid Nandwa, founder of Honeycoin, a Kenyan cross-border payment company\n\nWe have faced cloud outage issues in the past and were also hit with the recent AWS outage in November.\n\nThe approach we have applied to dealing with this is to have a “distributed stack” or multiple fallback options. We rely on multiple clouds, including AWS, Google Cloud, and Heroku. During the recent AWS outage, we temporarily switched to Google Cloud to maintain service availability for most of our customers.\n\nIf all cloud providers are down, we then fall back to using an on-premise server that we’ve created. It doesn’t perform as efficiently as our providers, but it comes in handy in moments where all the major providers are down. It’s locally hosted, so it’s an option to process requests when all else fails.\n\nSubscribing to multiple cloud providers definitely helps us not only to hedge against future risk but also to decrease reliance on a single one, and risk losing our data completely.\n\nHowever, multiple providers mean multiple bills at the end of the month.\n\nThe one-off cost of a single on-premise server installation is something we’re seriously considering to decrease reliance on the large players and also have more digital sovereignty. It’s pretty simple to set up, but it requires a lot of work to move our stack from any of the globally reputable providers to our own direct stack.\n\nOlumide Egbigbola, Nigeria-based product manager at Leatherback, a cross-border payment startup\n\nCompanies like ours can’t do much in such cases.\n\nCloud infrastructure is the backbone of most of the things that we do, as most of our critical services are hosted in the cloud. So any downtime from our cloud provider is immediately felt by our individuals and business users.

    "title": "CES 2026: You Can Finally Use XREAL's AR Glasses With the Nintendo Switch 2",
    "description": "Plus, XREAL's new AR glasses can automatically convert 2D content to 3D.",
    "fullText": "At CES 2026, I was able to play the Nintendo Switch 2 in AR. That's something I hadn't done before, and that's because until now, only one company had an AR dock that worked with Nintendo's latest console, which doesn't like to play nice with AR glasses plugged directly into it. Viture's solution is fine, if a bit bulky, but Lifehacker has long praised the AR glasses from competitor XREAL, and finally, you can use XREAL glasses with the Nintendo Switch 2.\n\nPreviously, XREAL did have an accessory that allowed for gameplay on the original Nintendo Switch, but it's since been discontinued, and even if you buy it secondhand, it won't work with the Switch 2. Now, the XREAL NEO changes that.\n\nComing in smaller than Viture's dock, the NEO is basically a combination portable battery bank and AR adapter that allows you to use your XREAL glasses while powering them and charging/converting whatever device you're displaying at the same time. It's got a 10,000 mAh capacity and a 20W output on its own—enough for fast charging—but you can also plug it into a wall while using it, which will allow your devices to charge at 65W+. That should be especially handy if you're primarily using the Neo as an adapter, and yes, it will allow your glasses to display the original Switch as well, not just the Switch 2. XREAL also notes that you can use the Neo on other handhelds like the Steam Deck, although it's a bit less necessary there, as the Steam Deck can output video to XREAL glasses directly.\n\nIn a confusing move, the Neo also has a magnetic ring to attach directly to your device, but it can't charge wirelessly. It seems the magnet is more there for easy storage, and so you can use a flip-out kickstand on the back of the Neo to prop your device up.\n\nUsing the Neo with the Switch 2, it worked like a dream. The console immediately swapped over to docked mode and started playing on a connected pair of XREAL glasses like it was on a television, which gave me a virtual 171-inch screen and graphics outputting at 1200p. Oh, and those graphics? They were in 3D.\n\nThat's because, alongside the Neo, I got to test out the new XREAL 1S AR glasses. These bump the resolution up to 1200p, and increase the FOV from the base XREAL One's 50 degrees to 52 degrees. Refresh rate is still 120Hz, but the glasses are brighter (at 700 nits) and the aspect ratio is larger, at 16:10. Most importantly, these come with the ability to add 3D depth to 2D imagery out of the box.\n\nI tried it out with Mario Kart World, and if you told me the game was designed with this 3D natively, I would have believed you. It was flawless, just the right amount of subtle, and I never saw any telltale blur around the characters. According to XREAL, though, the 2D-to-3D conversion is happening entirely within the glasses using the onboard spatial chip and AI.\n\nThis has the benefit of working with any content you plug into the XREAL 1S, although XREAL did warn me the effect might not come across as well for flat content as opposed to content using CGI. For instance, the AI just didn't know what to do with the original Super Mario Bros. for NES, leading to some elements getting depth and others being ignored.\n\nStill, you can turn the effect off in those cases, and I could see it being really handy if you're a big fan of 3D movies, since it can be kind of hard to find them on streaming. Now, you can turn any movie 3D, even if your mileage may vary from flick to flick.\n\nThe best part of the XREAL 1S, though? Despite the upgrades, they're actually cheaper than the base XREAL ONE, at $449 vs. $499. And they're available now, with estimated delivery windows sitting around this weekend. Plus, if you don't want to get a new pair of AR glasses, the 2D-to-3D conversion tech, called Real 3D, is also now out for the XREAL ONE Pro, and can be downloaded in an update.\n\nThe XREAL NEO, meanwhile, is currently only up for pre-order, with shipments scheduled to start in February. The Neo is available for $99 until February 4, by the way, but the price will jump up to $119 after that.\n\nEven with the cheaper NEO pricing, the total package for both the dock and the glasses will cost you $548. But if you really miss the 3DS, this is another easy way to play your Nintendo games in 3D, without sacrificing portably, but while keeping a big screen at the same time.",

    "fullText": "HONG KONG (AP) — South Korean President Lee Jae Myung arrived in China on Sunday as Beijing looks to deepen ties with the nearby country after heightened tensions between China and Japan over Taiwan, a self-ruled island it claims as its sovereign territory.\n\nLee's four-day trip is his first visit to China since taking office in June. It comes at a time of heightened tensions between China and Japan, after Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi said in November that her country’s military could get involved if China were to take action against Taiwan.\n\nChina's official news agency Xinhua reported on Sunday afternoon that Lee arrived in Beijing. During his stay, Lee will meet with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, their second meeting in just two months.\n\nLee signals commitment to China's ties\n\nAhead of his trip, Lee gave an interview to China's state broadcaster CCTV at Seoul's Cheong Wa Dae, the presidential office also known as the Blue House. Lee was quoted as saying that it was his first interview held in the presidential palace and that he hoped people would understand that his government cares about the relations between Beijing and Seoul.\n\nIn the interview, he assured that South Korea consistently respects the “One-China” policy when it comes to Taiwan, CCTV reported Friday. He said the healthy development of Beijing-Seoul relations depends on mutual respect. Lee also praised Xi as a “truly reliable neighbor.\"\n\nLast week, China staged large-scale military drills around the island for two days to warn against separatist and “external interference” forces. At that time, the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused Taiwan’s ruling party of trying to seek independence through requesting U.S. support.\n\nThe U.S. planned large-scale arms sales to Taiwan angered Beijing in December, leading to China sanctioning 20 U.S. defense-related companies.\n\nLee said Seoul's cooperation with the U.S, its military ally, does not mean South Korea-China relations should move toward confrontation, CCTV reported. He acknowledged that past misunderstandings between his country and China had hindered bilateral relations.\n\n“This visit to China aims to minimize or eliminate these past misunderstandings or contradictions, to elevate and develop South Korea-China relations to a new stage,” CCTV quoted him as saying.\n\nTo discuss the Korean Peninsula and strengthen economic ties\n\nSouth Korea and the U.S. have urged China, North Korea’s traditional ally and economic pipeline, to use its influence on its socialist neighbor to convince it to return to talks or abandon its nuclear program.\n\nBut China has long been suspected of avoiding fully implementing U.N. sanctions on North Korea and sending clandestine aid shipments to help the North stay afloat and continue to serve as a bulwark against U.S. influence on the Korean Peninsula.\n\nOn Sunday, North Korea launched multiple ballistic missiles toward the sea, South Korea’s military said, the latest weapons demonstration by the North ahead of its upcoming ruling party congress.\n\nLee’s visit is meant to strengthen bilateral ties and discuss ways to restore peace on the Korean Peninsula, South Korean officials said.\n\nDuring Monday’s summit, Lee and Xi are to hold “in-depth talks on substantive ways” to address security and economic issues facing the two countries, South Korea’s national security adviser Wi Sung-lac told a briefing Friday. On Tuesday, Lee is to meet Zhao Leji, chairman of the National People’s Congress, and Premier Li Qiang, Wi said.\n\nDuring Lee’s trip, South Korea will also request that China play “a constructive role” in efforts to promote peace on the Korean Peninsula, Wi said. In their November talks, Lee already asked Xi to make greater efforts to persuade North Korea to return to talks.\n\nSouth Korea would push for substantial achievements that could directly benefit ordinary citizens in both countries too, Wi said.\n\nKim reported from Seoul, South Korea",

Australia are 166-2 after 34.1 overs and have cut the deficit to 218.\n\nThe tourists had earlier lost 7-158, including a final collapse of 5-61 sparked by Jamie Smith's horrific dismissal.\n\nSmith, who was caught off a no-ball and had other moments of fortune in his skittish 46, played a truly awful shot to be caught off part-time medium-pacer Marnus Labuschagne.\n\nOn a pitch that offered more for the bowlers on Monday, England's total felt around par, and Australia's batters made rapid inroads, helped by the tourists' attack and two dropped catches.\n\nWith new-ball bowlers Brydon Carse and Matthew Potts leaking runs, Jake Weatherald was put down twice as he and Head added 50 in 9.2 overs.\n\nIt took the belated introduction of captain Ben Stokes to trap Weatherald lbw, with Head then sharing another 105 with Labuschagne. Stokes and Labuschagne exchanged words before the England captain drew him into an edge to gully for 48.\n\nHead remains, on course for his third century of the series. Of equal concern for England would have been the fitness of Root, but a spell off the field at the end of the day was later explained as cramp in his back.\n\n'2/10' - how England's bowling unravelled in Sydney\n\nCenturion Root eyes next Ashes series down under\n\n'Brainless' Smith wicket 'sums up' England's Ashes\n\nHyped and anticipated, this has turned into a poor Ashes series, low on quality, individual brilliance and magic moments.\n\nThe second day of this finale was in keeping with what came before. Root and Head elevated themselves above the rest and Michael Neser took 4-60 in an improved Australia bowling performance, but England were slapdash with the ball and Smith's dismissal was atrocious.\n\nEven the obvious Australian plan was bizarre. Labuschagne, who had not before taken a Test wicket with his seam, had seven fielders on the boundary for some gentle bouncers.\n\nStill, Smith continued his poor tour with a forehand to Scott Boland at deepish cover. It was a dismissal that encapsulated the carelessness that so often costs this England team.\n\nOnly three times has a team made more than England's 384 batting first in a Test on this ground and lost, and the pitch is already showing signs of uneven bounce.\n\nBut Australia have the prolific Head, the opportunity to go beyond England's score on Tuesday and the potential of pressuring the fragile visitors in the third innings.\n\nHead's elevation to open in the second innings of the first Test in Perth was the defining moment of the series and the left-hander is tucking into England's bowling once more.\n\nSomehow, England continue to feed his strength outside off stump. Arguably neither Carse nor Potts - the latter playing his first Test for more than a year - should have been opening the bowling, and they let Australia get off to a flyer.\n\nIn fairness, each bowler had Weatherald dropped. Root parried a tough high edge at first slip off Potts when Weatherald had nine, then Ben Duckett shelled a more straightforward chance at mid-wicket off Carse when he had 14.\n\nStokes, on in the 11th over, ensured neither miss was too costly. With his eighth delivery, the captain had Weatherald play all around a full one.\n\nFollowing his intervention with the ball, Labuschagne eased into Head's slipstream. Head carved through the off side, Labuschagne played clips and drives. The clouds gathered, Potts' economy was more than eight an over.\n\nAs the umpires discussed the light, Stokes and Labuschagne went at each other. Play continued, Stokes got his man, and Head slowed up to leave an overnight wait for his hundred.\n\nRoot has been feast or famine in this series. Until this Test, his landmark century in Brisbane was one of only two occasions when he passed 20. In Sydney, the city where he was dropped for the only time in his Test career and once batted himself into hospital in extreme heat, the former captain was outstanding.\n\nWithout Root, England would have squandered their promising overnight position of 211-3. Harry Brook played a limp poke at Scott Boland to be caught at slip for 84 and Stokes edged a beauty from Mitchell Starc for an 11-ball duck, meaning the tourists lost 2-3 in four overs.\n\nOn one hand, Smith's role in a stand of 94 with Root was valuable, but the wicketkeeper was fortunate to last so long. He was caught off a Cameron Green no-ball on 22, then edged and miscued the same bowler. The dismissal to Labuschagne's bouncer plan as the second new ball approached was an appalling piece of cricket.\n\nOn he went, adding 52 for the seventh wicket with Will Jacks. He passed 150 for the 17th time in Tests - only four other players have done so more.\n\nRoot eventually offered a leading edge to a diving Neser in the bowler's follow-through, part of England's final collapse of 4-9. After carrying England's batting, perhaps it is no surprise he later suffered discomfort in his back.\n\nGet cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "We're just hours away from the start of CES 2026, and with that comes Intel's launch event. The chip giant is expected to provide more details on its AI PC initiative and the new processors powering it: The Core Ultra Series 3 CPUs (aka Panther Lake) are made using an 18A process — that's 18 angstroms, or just under 2nm — and designed for high-end laptops and gaming devices.\n\nFor Intel, the stakes at CES are higher than ever. In the past 12 months, both NVIDIA and the US government acquired ownership stakes in the company, helping nearly double the stock price by the end of the year. But that's still down over more than 20 percent since 2021, as rivals like TSMC, Qualcomm, AMD and NVIDIA have taken the leadership mantle in chip fabrication and AI hardware.\n\nSenior VP of Intel's Client Computing Group Jim Johnson will kick off the launch event on Monday, January 5 at 6PM ET. A livestream will be available on the Intel Newsroom YouTube channel, which we'll post here when it's live.\n\nAs we noted above, Intel has publicly confirmed that it will be highlighting \"the next generation of Intel-powered PCs, edge solution, and the AI experiences enabled by the new Intel Core Ultra Series 3 Processors.\" We'll be keen to hear if the company can address the profitability concerns that have surrounded those next-gen chips since at least last summer, when published reports indicated that yields were still under 50 percent. (In response, Intel told Engadget that it felt \"very good\" about its trajectory on Panther Lake, though it didn't hit the late 2025 release date it had envisioned at the time.)\n\nWill we get any updates on that NVIDIA partnership? It's possible. But don't expect to hear anything about Intel possibly fabricating the chips for that rumored new entry-level MacBook Air. If that comes to pass, the announcement will definitely be at a time and place of Apple's choosing.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United have sacked manager Ruben Amorim, with the club planning to appoint a caretaker manager for the remainder of the season.\n\nFormer midfielder Darren Fletcher will take charge for Wednesday's Premier League game against Burnley.\n\nThe Scot will remain in place until a caretaker is appointed for the rest of the campaign, with the club planning to name a permanent successor for Amorim in the summer.\n\nOn Friday Amorim hinted that his relationship with club officials was strained - suggesting he would not be fully backed in the transfer market.\n\nAnd following the 1-1 draw with Leeds on Sunday, the Portuguese aimed another dig at senior United figures, stating he wanted to work as a manager \"not the coach\" and was ready to leave when his contract expired in 18 months' time.\n\nLess than 24 hours later, the club announced Amorim had \"departed his role as head coach of Manchester United\" after 14 months in charge.\n\n\"With Manchester United sitting sixth in the Premier League, the club's leadership has reluctantly made the decision that it is the right time to make a change,\" United said.\n\n\"This will give the team the best opportunity of the highest possible Premier League finish.\n\n\"The club would like to thank Ruben for his contribution to the club and wishes him well for the future.\"\n\nAmorim's coaching team have also left United.\n\nIn October, United co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe said on The Business podcast, external Amorim would be given three years to \"demonstrate he is a great coach\" and that the club needed to be \"patient\".\n\nBut sources have told BBC Sport that the club now feels there has not been sufficient evidence of evolution or progress this season under Amorim.\n\nThe 40-year-old was appointed in November 2024 after United agreed to pay Portuguese club Sporting 11m euros (£9.25m) to trigger a release clause in his contract.\n\nAmorim won 25 of his 63 games in charge of the Red Devils, while his 14-month stint is the shortest reign of a permanent manager at United since David Moyes was sacked just eight months into his tenure in 2014.\n\nFormer United midfielder Fletcher is currently the under-18s head coach and was the club's technical director between 2021 and 2024, but he has never held a senior coaching position.\n\nThe 41-year-old former Scotland international played for United between 2002 and 2015, winning five Premier League titles along with the 2007-08 Champions League.\n\nHe is expected to hold United's news conference on Tuesday before their game against Burnley at Turf Moor the following day.",

    "title": "Jim Cramer says achieving early retirement comes down to just 3 key assets in your investment portfolio",
    "description": "Here's a winning formula.",
    "fullText": "If early retirement is something you're striving for, you're not alone. A 2024 YouGov survey found that 22% of Gen Zers and 30% of millennials expect to retire between the ages of 51 and 60. (1) That’s young, especially if you consider that Medicare eligibility typically doesn’t begin until age 65 and Social Security’s full retirement age for Gen Zers and millennials is 67.\n\nIf your goal is to retire early, you’ll need to save aggressively early on in your career and invest your money wisely. Finance personality Jim Cramer has some guidance in that regard.\n\nHe told CNBC (2) he has a “radical” approach to help everyday investors grow their portfolios and meet their financial goals. Here are the three assets Cramer says to invest in — and what you need to know about them.\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nI’m almost 50 years old and have nothing saved for retirement. What do I do? Don’t panic. Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nInvesting in index funds is a strategy many financial experts recommend.\n\nIndex funds are passively managed funds that aim to mirror the performance of a specific market benchmark. An S&P 500 index fund, for example, will seek to replicate the S&P 500’s performance by matching its holdings and weightings.\n\nThey differ from actively managed funds in that they don’t have professionals hand-picking stocks. An active fund will try to perform better than the S&P 500 by picking a handful of stocks from it. Conversely, rather than try to beat the market, an index fund is happy to capture its returns.\n\nInvesting legend Warren Buffett has long recommended that everyday investors put their long-term savings into index funds. And research supports this theory. Index funds tend to outperform the majority of fund managers tasked with picking stocks, especially when factoring in their lower fees.\n\nFor example, according to S&P Global, in the 15 years ending June 30, 2025, roughly 88% of actively managed large-cap funds underperformed the S&P 500 index. (3)\n\nWhile some financial experts may recommend putting all or the bulk of your investment capital into index funds, Cramer says to keep them to about 45% to 50% of your portfolio.\n\nHis logic is that a large position in index funds can help anchor and diversify your portfolio. But branching out into other assets could make it possible to beat the market broadly and enjoy higher returns.",

    "description": "\"We cannot be quiet on the disappearance.\"",
    "fullText": "Glaciers tend to feel eternal — immune to human timelines. But scientists say that illusion is cracking.\n\nOn Mount Kenya, one of Africa's most iconic natural landmarks, ancient glaciers are shrinking so fast that experts have warned they can vanish entirely within just a few years.\n\nLewis Pugh, a United Nations Environment Program goodwill ambassador, climbed Mount Kenya's highest peak in December to visit the Lewis Glacier. What he saw wasn't a frozen fortress — it was a remnant.\n\nAccording to Context, scientists estimate that Africa's remaining glaciers could disappear by 2030. On Mount Kenya, the timeline may be even shorter.\n\n\"Scientists predict that in the next three to five years, it will disappear completely,\" Pugh told the publication. \"We cannot be quiet on the disappearance of Africa's last glaciers.\"\n\nThese glaciers once helped regulate temperatures and steadily release freshwater used for drinking, farming, and energy production.\n\nNow, rising average temperatures pull moisture from the ice faster than snowfall can replace it — part of a long-term warming pattern driven by human activity, not an isolated weather event.\n\nWhat happens on Mount Kenya doesn't stay on Mount Kenya.\n\nKenya's Lewis Glacier isn't an outlier — it's part of a global pattern. In Italy, scientists warn that the iconic Marmolada Glacier could disappear by 2040. Farther south, glaciers in the Andes are predicted to shrink by as much as 55% to 78% by the end of the century.\n\nThe impacts of rising temperatures aren't limited to ice, either: warmer ocean waters near the Great Barrier Reef have already triggered repeated mass bleaching events, threatening one of the world's most diverse marine ecosystems.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nAs ice disappears around the world — including in the Arctic — sea levels rise, pushing higher tides into coastal neighborhoods during storms. That flooding damages homes, disrupts ports, and threatens food systems that depend on stable shipping and fertile land.\n\nExtreme weather has always existed, but scientists agree that human-caused warming acts like steroids for storms, floods, and heat waves — making them stronger, longer-lasting, and more destructive.\n\nGlobally, researchers and advocates are pushing for faster reductions in pollution that trap heat in the atmosphere. Some governments are expanding clean energy and protecting water sources tied to melting ice.\n\nThere are also many ways to help on an individual level. Using less energy at home, supporting clean transportation, cutting food waste, and staying informed about critical environmental issues all reduce the pressure driving ice loss worldwide.\n\nThe glaciers on Mount Kenya may be small, but their message is loud: the systems that keep communities stable are more fragile than they look — and they need attention now, not later.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "LONDON (AP) — Auschwitz survivor Eva Schloss, the stepsister of teenage diarist Anne Frank and a tireless educator about the horrors of the Holocaust, has died. She was 96.\n\nThe Anne Frank Trust UK, of which Schloss was honorary president, said she died Saturday in London, where she lived.\n\nBritain’s King Charles III said he was “privileged and proud” to have known Schloss, who co-founded the charitable trust to help young people challenge prejudice.\n\n“The horrors that she endured as a young woman are impossible to comprehend and yet she devoted the rest of her life to overcoming hatred and prejudice, promoting kindness, courage, understanding and resilience through her tireless work for the Anne Frank Trust UK and for Holocaust education across the world,” the king said.\n\nBorn Eva Geiringer in Vienna in 1929, Schloss fled with her family to Amsterdam after Nazi Germany annexed Austria. She became friends with another Jewish girl of the same age, Anne Frank, whose diary would become one of the most famous chronicles of the Holocaust.\n\nLike the Franks, Eva's family spent two years in hiding to avoid capture after the Nazis occupied the Netherlands. They were eventually betrayed, arrested and sent to the Auschwitz death camp.\n\nSchloss and her mother Fritzi survived until the camp was liberated by Soviet troops in 1945. Her father Erich and brother Heinz died in Auschwitz.\n\nAfter the war, Eva moved to Britain, married German Jewish refugee Zvi Schloss and settled in London.\n\nIn 1953, her mother married Frank’s father, Otto, the only member of his immediate family to survive. Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp at the age of 15, months before the end of the war.\n\nSchloss did not speak publicly about her experiences for decades, later saying that wartime trauma had made her withdrawn and unable to connect with others.\n\n“I was silent for years, first because I wasn’t allowed to speak. Then I repressed it. I was angry with the world,” she told The Associated Press in 2004.\n\nBut after she addressed the opening of an Anne Frank exhibition in London in 1986, Schloss made it her mission to educate younger generations about the Nazi genocide. Over the following decades she spoke in schools and prisons, at international conferences and told her story in books including “Eva’s Story: A Survivor’s Tale by the Stepsister of Anne Frank.”\n\nShe kept campaigning into her 90s. In 2019, she traveled to Newport Beach, California to meet teenagers who were photographed making Nazi salutes at a high school party. The following year she was part of a campaign urging Facebook to remove Holocaust-denying material from the social networking site.\n\n“We must never forget the terrible consequences of treating people as ‘other,’” Schloss said in 2024. “We need to respect everybody’s races and religions. We need to live together with our differences. The only way to achieve this is through education, and the younger we start the better.”\n\nSchloss’ family remembered her as “a remarkable woman: an Auschwitz survivor, a devoted Holocaust educator, tireless in her work for remembrance, understanding and peace.”\n\n“We hope her legacy will continue to inspire through the books, films and resources she leaves behind,” the family said in a statement.\n\nZvi Schloss died in 2016. Eva Schloss is survived by their three daughters, as well as grandchildren and great-grandchildren.",

Metcalf set to return. He served a two-game suspension after an altercation with a fan in Week 16.",

    "description": "The Cincinnati Reds should not trade their starting catcher Tyler Stephenson.",
    "fullText": "As the Cincinnati Reds weigh their options heading into the 2026 season, one of the more debated topics has been whether the team should consider moving catcher Tyler Stephenson. While the Reds are operating on a limited payroll and have another capable catcher on the roster, trading Stephenson would be a mistake for several reasons.\n\nFirst, his backup, Jose Trevino, is best suited for a defensive role rather than as a full-time starter. Trevino has earned both a Gold Glove and a Platinum Glove Award, proving his value behind the plate, but his bat remains a liability. He is most effective as a defensive replacement or in spot starts, not as the everyday catcher. That reality underscores Stephenson’s importance, as he provides offensive production that is rare to find at the position.\n\nStephenson’s versatility also adds value. Beyond catching, he has the ability to play first base, giving manager Terry Francona flexibility in constructing lineups. For a team trying to maximize resources, having a player who can fill multiple roles is critical. Trading him simply to address other areas of the roster would weaken the team’s depth and reduce options in the infield.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Stephenson’s trade value is not at its peak. He is coming off a down year for his standards in which he hit .231 with a .316 on-base percentage, .737 OPS, 13 home runs and 50 RBIs. Moving him now would mean selling low, rather than waiting for him to rebound to the level he showed in 2024, when he was a key offensive piece.\n\nStephenson will be entering his seventh year with the Reds after being drafted 11th overall in the 2015 MLB Draft. His connection to the organization and fanbase adds intangible value that cannot be overlooked. As a homegrown player who has delivered memorable moments, he embodies the team’s identity and helps drive fan engagement, which is vital for a franchise looking to sustain momentum and build its culture.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, keeping Stephenson allows the Reds to develop younger catchers at a natural pace. He can serve as a bridge until a long-term successor is ready, rather than forcing a premature transition. His combination of above-average offense for his position, defensive leadership and clubhouse stability makes a compelling case for Cincinnati to hold onto him.\n\nTrading Stephenson might seem like a quick fix, but in reality, the Reds are better positioned to contend by keeping him in the fold.",

    "fullText": "The post-match fallout from the Leeds United game on Sunday is threatening the engulf Manchester United, and could potentially derail the season.\n\nRuben Amorim came out with a bizarre rant as his team fought back to claim a point away at Elland Road.\n\nThe head coach suggested that he lacked the power to make key decisions, and was not being backed in the transfer market, while also being asked to shift from his preferred system.\n\n“I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. And I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal.”\n\nThose comments have not gone down well among the INEOS hierarchy with Talksport reporting that the head coach’s future now hangs in the balance.\n\nA power struggle with director of football Jason Wilcox has emerged behind the scenes, with the former Manchester City man directing the Portuguese tactician to change his rigid style.\n\nThe win over Newcastle and the improved second-half display against Leeds are clear examples that a shift to a four at the back suits the current injury-riddled squad.\n\nThe Antoine Semenyo saga has also upset Amorim, who wants INEOS to go and spend big on other areas during January.\n\nHowever, with most big names unlikely to jump ship mid-season, they are reluctant to back the head coach with more signings tailored to his specific style.\n\n“Ruben Amorim’s future at Manchester United is in the balance after his explosive press conference on Sunday, talkSPORT understands.\n\n“Amorim’s fractured relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox is viewed by sources close to United as making his long-term position uncertain.\n\n“talkSPORT understands Amorim’s frustrations have boiled over after United’s top brass including Wilcox urged him to be more tactically flexible.\n\n“If it comes down to a power struggle between Amorim and Wilcox chief executive Omar Berrada is expected to back the latter.\n\n“Amorim also feels promises he would be allowed to his squad in this transfer window have been broken, with United now planning a quiet January.”\n\nIt has been a difficult few weeks, both on and off the pitch, for the 20-time English league champions, with injuries and AFCON meaning the squad has been stretched way too thin.\n\nAnd the results have taken a beating, with Ruben Amorim’s adamant stance regarding his own tactical style not really helping matters.\n\nThe INEOS hierarchy are far from pleased with the lack of tactical flexibility and Christopher Vivell went to great lengths to point that out after the Fulham game earlier in the season.\n\nThe entire episode is eerily similar to the Enzo Maresca saga that erupted at Chelsea recently. And everything points towards a similar conclusion.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "They met two days prior to Sunday night’s encounter at Crypto.com Arena, a two-game set between the Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies reminiscent of a playoff series.\n\nThe Lakers won the first game Friday night and knew the Grizzlies were going to bring more intensity and a stronger effort even with star guard Ja Morant (right calf contusion) not playing.\n\nAnd that was the case, the Lakers falling behind by 16 points in the second quarter, the Grizzlies ramping it up in a big way. But with Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Jake LaRavia leading the way, the Lakers pulled out a 120-114 win.\n\nDoncic almost had a triple-double with 36 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. James had 26 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. LaRavia, starting in the absence of Rui Hachimura, had 26 points, five rebounds and four assists. It was the second straight time LaRavia, who came in averaging 9.1 points, scored 20-plus.\n\nA back-and-forth game featured several lead changes in the fourth quarter, with the Lakers and Grizzlies taking turns delivering in tense moments. The Lakers finally took the lead for good at 100-99 on a basket by Doncic.\n\nThen James scored on a three-point play and made one of two free throws for a 104-99 lead with 3 minutes 49 seconds left.\n\nThe Lakers (22-11) had an answer for every Grizzlies counter, the final stamp on the game being Doncic’s back-to-back three-pointers for a nine-point lead with 2:01 left.\n\nThe NBA scheduling the Lakers to host the Grizzlies on Friday and again Sunday was not an issue for coach JJ Redick.\n\n“I like it,” Redick said. “I do think it does replicate [the playoffs] in some ways. A playoff series, particularly when it's not a home-and-away situation, but more of you're playing a two-game series on somebody's home court for the day in between. Had a few of these last year. So, I like this for our team and it's a good growth opportunity. Coming off a win, knowing that there's a lot of stuff that we can be better at and where can we make improvements. That's the big challenge to me.”\n\nFor Redick, that meant what it always does for the Lakers — improving on defense.\n\nRedick wanted his team to get back on defense faster and not let the Grizzlies (15-20) get so many early offense opportunities.\n\nThe Lakers also wanted to jump-start center Deandre Ayton from a five-game slumber.\n\nAyton had just four points on two-for-four shooting against the Grizzlies on Friday night and hadn’t scored more than 12 points in that span.\n\nSo, the Lakers went to Ayton at the outset, trying to ignite his game. It worked to a degree, Ayton scoring 15 points, grabbing eight rebounds and blocking three shots.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "New Jersey native Brenden Aaronson's goal for Leeds United leads the way for Americans abroad, with Antonee Robinson and Christian Pulisic also in action.",
    "fullText": "In the 62nd minute of Leeds United’s clash with Manchester United on Sunday, Brenden Aaronson won over the Elland Road crowd with his first goal in more than two months.\n\nThe English Premier League match would end in a 1-1 draw, leaving Leeds in the bottom five, but for both the West Yorkshire club and the 25-year-old American midfielder, the goal was another bright moment after a November swoon.\n\nJust six weeks ago, Leeds manager Daniel Farke was so concerned about the relentless social-media criticism aimed at Aaronson that he spoke out with great passion. With Leeds unbeaten in seven straight and the U.S. men’s national team veteran playing well, both have been able to breathe easier.\n\nAaronson provided the lead Sunday, slipping into defender Ayden Heaven’s blind spot to pounce on Pascal Struijk’s well-weighted throughball. The New Jersey native then warded off Heaven before coolly finishing into the far corner for his second Premier League goal of the season.\n\nThe Red Devils answered three minutes later, but the result was good enough to extend Leeds’ run to 2-0-5 since a four-match losing streak in November. The Whites (5-8-7) sit in 16th place but eight points clear of the relegation zone.\n\n“It is great for the team to stay unbeaten,” Aaronson said, “but of course we wanted three points.”\n\nDescribing the goal, he said, “I just was kind of just running in behind to see if I could get lucky. Sometimes you have to take a chance. The ball came to me. I think that the centre back didn't know I was going to be kind of running off his shoulder like that. It was a good touch, and then it is just about putting it on target.”\n\nSince being demoted to the bench for four consecutive matches, Aaronson has started four in a row. Last weekend, he assisted in a 1-1 draw at Sunderland. His three assists lead the team and, combined with his two goals, he is tied for second in goal contributions.\n\nIt was a very different situation in late November, when fan anger prompted Farke to come to the American’s defense.\n\n\"I'm just worried how we are as a society, with social media stuff, how we are as human beings,\" he said at the time. \"You just see the negative comments. If you see 5,000 negative comments about yourself as a 25-year-old guy, you think the whole world is on your shoulders.\n\n\"I could make my life easy and also slam him and then everyone would say, 'Yes, Daniel, great, we don’t like him anyway.’ But I protect human beings. This is what I do. I work with human beings. I don't work with robots. I also see what this lad is doing. And he is always a fantastic teammate. He works his socks off.”\n\nFarke added, “Judge his performances, be at least a little bit fair. And if you don't want to do this in terms of relationship, come on, be a bit respectful with a young lad of 25 years old. And then, otherwise, we don't have to have all this mental-health awareness days, and we can put it into the bin.”\n\nA member of the 2022 World Cup team, Aaronson appeared in eight matches last year, with three starts, one goal (against Trinidad & Tobago at the Gold Cup) and one assist. He was left off the September roster, made one sub appearance in the October friendlies and, a month later, started against Paraguay and came in late against Uruguay.\n\nWith midfielder Tyler Adams and center back Chris Richards injured, Aaronson was among just two Americans in Premier League action over the weekend. Antonee Robinson, Fulham’s left back/wing back, went the distance in a wild 2-2 home draw with Liverpool. Both teams scored in second-half stoppage time.\n\nSince recovering from a knee injury, Robinson has played every minute of six consecutive matches across all competitions.\n\nIn the second-flight English Championship, central midfielder Aidan Morris played 90 in Middlesbrough’s 4-0 win over Southampton, a result that trimmed the gap with first-place Coventry City to six points.\n\nForward Haji Wright entered in the 67th in Coventry’s 3-2 loss at Birmingham City, extending the frontrunner’s winless streak to three matches.\n\nForward Patrick Agyemang (60 minutes) went scoreless for the third consecutive match as Derby County fell 2-1 to Wrexham. Forward Josh Sargent logged 89 minutes in a 2-0 loss to Stoke City.\n\nMidfielder Weston McKennie scored his first Serie A goal of the season, connecting from close range in the 50th minute in a 1-1 draw with Lecce. He has scored twice in the Champions League.\n\nJust four minutes into the second half, Weston McKennie sweeps in the equalizer for Juventus 🔥🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/eHKvb94Jci\n\n— CBS Sports Golazo ⚽️ (@CBSSportsGolazo) January 3, 2026\n\nAmid a stretch of six matches in 22 days, AC Milan top scorer Christian Pulisic came off the bench in the 79th minute of a 1-0 victory over Cagliari.\n\nMidfielder Yunus Musah continues to struggle for starting roles, entering in the 59th minute of Atalanta’s 1-0 win over Roma.\n\nStriker Folarin Balogun’s accidental assist was the lone highlight of slumping Monaco’s 3-1 home loss to Lyon. With Balogun spun around by a defender while in transition just before halftime, the ball nicked his foot and fell into the path of Mamadou Coulibaly for the one-timer.\n\nMidfielder Tanner Tessmann entered in the 66th minute for Lyon, which has won four straight in all competitions.\n\nWing back Tim Weah played 90 for third-place Olympique Marseille, which lost two players to first-half red cards and lost to Nantes 2-0 snapping a three-game winning streak across all competitions.\n\nCenter back Mark McKenzie went the distance in Toulouse’s 3-0 home loss to first-place Lens. He has started 15 of 17 league matches.\n\nIn Glasgow’s Old Firm derby, center back Auston Trusty played 90 minutes in Celtic’s 3-1 home loss to Rangers — the sixth defeat in eight matches under former Columbus Crew boss Wilfried Nancy. Trusty missed an early scoring chance and didn’t perform well in the second half. “Overworked and underskilled,” The Times wrote. …\n\nIn Spain’s La Liga, midfielder Johnny Cardoso played the last half-hour of Atletico Madrid’s 1-1 draw at Real Sociedad. …\n\nThe German and Dutch leagues are on winter break, impacting eight U.S. national team candidates.

    "fullText": "East Carolina Katin Houser announced his intent to enter the transfer portal back in December. On Sunday, Jan. 4, his whereabouts for the 2026 season were confirmed.\n\nHouser is heading back to the Big Ten, officially committing to Illinois.\n\nLast Ride. Let’s get to work!! I-L-L🔶🔷 pic.twitter.com/Cg2FEJOwGE\n\n— Katin Houser (@katinhouser) January 5, 2026\n\nHouser originally launched his college career at Michigan State where he took a redshirt in 2022 before becoming the primary starter in October 2023. The California native started seven games for the Spartans in 2023, throwing for 1,130 yards, six touchdowns, and five interceptions. Michigan State underwent a head coaching change that offseason and Houser started anew at East Carolina.\n\nThe fit was seamless as Houser spearheaded a bounce-back season for the program in 2024. He earned the starting role again in October, posting a 5-2 record while collecting 2,006 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, as well as four rushing touchdowns. Houser guided the Pirates to a thrilling victory over rival NC State in the 2024 Military Bowl and then elected to run it back for 2025.\n\nEast Carolina was in the American Conference contention circle as late as November during Houser’s highly-successful 2025 campaign. The quarterback is currently 19th in the FBS with 3,300 passing yards, delivering 19 touchdowns to six interceptions on a 65.9 completion rate. Houser enjoyed his best rushing season to date as well, contributing 193 yards and nine touchdowns as a frequent goal line threat. ECU won its most regular season games since 2014, but Houser did not remain with the team through the Military Bowl. Still, the Pirates upset Pitt 23-17 as two-touchdown underdogs to cement a 9-4 season.\n\nHouser joins an Illinois squad that graduates three-year starter Luke Altmyer, who completed a successful stint with the Fighting Illini last week by winning MVP honors of the Music City Bowl. Illinois generated back-to-back 9-win seasons for the first time ever, and Houser will be tasked with continuing that newfound success.\n\nFor East Carolina, the Pirates have options. Chaston Ditta, who started and led the team to victory as a true freshman in the Military Bowl, is one potential starter for 2026. The Pirates could also add depth through the portal this January as they aim to build upon this 9-4 season.",

    "fullText": "Aaron Rodgers threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Calvin Austin III with 55 seconds left, and the Steelers beat the Ravens 26-24 on Sunday night when Baltimore’s Tyler Loop missed a 44-yard field goal as time expired, giving Pittsburgh the AFC North title.\n\nPittsburgh (10-7) will host Houston (12-5) in the opening round of the playoffs on Monday, Jan. 12, following an electric fourth quarter that saw four lead changes, including three in the final four minutes.\n\nThe Ravens were poised to swing the lead back their way one last time after Lamar Jackson connected with Isaiah Likely for a 28-yard gain that put the Ravens within Loop’s range.\n\nThe rookie’s kick never had a chance, sailing well to the right of the goalposts as the Steelers poured onto the field to celebrate their first division title in five years.\n\nRodgers passed for a season-high 294 yards and his 26-yard toss to Austin made it 26-24. Chris Boswell missed the extra point, giving the Ravens a chance to win with a field goal.\n\nJackson, dealing with a painful back contusion, passed for 238 yards and three scores, including a pair to Zay Flowers in the fourth quarter. Each of Flowers’ TDs — from 50 and 64 yards — put Balti\n\nPittsburgh responded each time, and will now welcome the Texans while looking to end a playoff victory drought that stretches to the 2016 AFC championship game.\n\nPittsburgh’s running back duo of Kenneth Gainwell and Jaylen Warren combined for 173 total yards as the Steelers bounced back from a loss last week in Cleveland and ended a wildly uneven season for Jackson and the Ravens.\n\nThe Steelers trailed by 10 early, and a repeat of the bludgeoning they took at the hands of Balti\n\nThe defense, pushed around repeatedly by Derrick Henry since he joined the Ravens last season, finally responded and the offense — playing without suspended wide receiver DK Metcalf — slowly found its footing.\n\nHenry ran for 126 yards for the Ravens and became the ninth player in NFL history to reach 13,000 career yards rushing but was held mostly in check during a second half that morphed into an improbable shootout.\n\nJackson’s first touchdown pass to Flowers was a thing of beauty. The two-time MVP ducked out of the reach of two would-be tacklers before floating a pass to a streaking Flowers to put the Ravens up 17-13.\n\nGainwell sprinted in from 2 yards out with 3:49 remaining to put Pittsburgh back in front. The Ravens, looking to become the first team since the creation of the AFC North in 2003 to win the division three consecutive years, needed all of three plays to reclaim the lead when Jackson lofted a pass to a wide-open Flowers for a 64-yard score.\n\nRodgers, in what may be the final stretch of his 21-year career, responded by taking the Steelers 65 yards in six plays, the last a rainbow down the left sideline to Austin, who was alone after a Ravens defender fell down.\n\nBoswell then missed his first extra point of the season after 40 straight makes, opening the door for the Ravens. Baltimore appeared poised to end its longtime rival’s season for the second time in 12 months before Loop’s kick started right and stayed there.\n\nThe win was the 193rd regular-season victory of Steelers coach Mike Tomlin’s career, tying him with Hall of Famer Chuck Noll for the franchise record and for ninth on the NFL’s career list.\n\nThe 40th meeting between Tomlin and Ravens coach John Harbaugh — only Hall of Famers George Halas and Curly Lambeau faced each other more — was among the most memorable.\n\nWhether it’s also the last remains to be seen. Harbaugh faces questions about his future after a rocky 18th season.\n\nTomlin, the longest-tenured head coach in major North American professional sports, heads into the postseason with a club that has only occasionally looked like a contender.\n\nThe real test awaits next week.",

In fact, Simone Inzaghi’s side have won their past nine on the bounce in the RSL.\n\nAs it stands, Al Hilal lead the standings for the first time this term. They sit one point clear of Al Nassr after 13 rounds, with third-placed Al Taawoun three points further back.\n\nSpeaking after his team claimed top spot on Sunday, Inzaghi said: “We were good. We played a mature game; we didn't concede anything to a team that didn't lose in six games; they scored 12 times in the last 13 games.\n\n“So it wasn't an easy game, but we approached it well and deservedly won. We are at the top of the table. Thank God we got out of this game without any injuries.”\n\nThe RSL returns on Thursday, when Al Hilal open Matchweek 14 with a home clash against Al Hazem, while Al Nassr play later that night when they welcome a resurgent Al Qadsiah to Al Awwal Park.\n\nAnd, remember, Al Hilal and Al Nassr face off in the Capital Derby in the following round, on January 12.",

(Black & Gold Nation) — A missed 44 yard field goal from Tyler Loop as time expired as given the Steelers the AFC North title after a wild 26-24 win over the Ravens to advance to the playoffs.\n\nAfter a quiet first three quarters that saw the Steelers lead 13-10 heading to the fourth quarter, Aaron Rodgers and Lamar Jackson traded shots all throughout the second half of the game.\n\nWe saw vintage Lamar Jackson midway through the fourth quarter as he used some wizardry to escape a sack from Alex Highsmith and then chucked a bomb down field to Zay Flowers for a 50 yard touchdown pass to give the Ravens a 17-10 lead.\n\nRodgers responded by leading the Steelers on an eight play 60 yard drive that ended with a two yard touchdown run from Kenneth Gainwell, who earlier in the week was named the team MVP this season.\n\nIt didn’t take Jackson long to answer. Facing 3rd & 1 at the 36 yard line Jackson stood in the pocket and once again found Zay Flowers wide open down field. 64 yards later he was in the endzone putting the Ravens up 24-20 with 2:20 left in the game.\n\nAaron Rodgers showed why he was a four time MVP and with the season on the line he found Calvin Austin open down the sideline for a 26 yard go ahead touchdown with 55 seconds remaining, but Chris Boswell missed the PAT and the Steelers lead was only two points at 26-24.\n\nJackson got the Ravens to midfield, but facing 4th & 7. With the Ravens needing to convert or have their season end Jackson found Isaiah Likely for an improbable 26 yard gain to get into field goal range. That set up Tyler Loop for a 44 yard field goal to win the game and the division, but the kick missed wide right.\n\nAaron Rodgers threw for a season high 294 yards with one touchdown. Kenneth Gainwell led the Steelers in receiving with eight catches for 64 yards. On the defensive side of the ball T.J. Watt returned after missing three games with a punctured lung and recorded an interception that led to a Steelers field goal.\n\nIn the Wild Card round of the playoffs the Steelers will host the Texans on Monday night at 8:15 p.m.",

    "fullText": "The Virginia Tech Hokies had a big recruiting weekend, with the NCAA transfer portal opening on Friday. As expected, commitments followed. First, former Penn State DL Daniel Jennings announced he was transferring to Virginia Tech.\n\nNot long afterward, former Penn State tight end Matt Henderson revealed he was following Jennings to Blacksburg. Like Jennings, it’s a homecoming for Henderson, who is a native of Powhatan, Virginia. Jennings is from Princeton, West Virginia, about an hour away from Blacksburg.\n\nComing HOME @HokiesFB pic.twitter.com/BffZwQaJms\n\n— Matt Henderson (@MattHend2025) January 4, 2026\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 246-pound Henderson played basketball and football in high school, where he was a standout in both sports. After enrolling at Penn State, Henderson was mentored by Ty Howle, Virginia Tech’s new offensive coordinator and tight ends coach. Henderson redshirted in 2025, so he has four years of eligibility remaining with the Hokies.\n\nHenderson was a late riser in the recruiting world. However, once he worked out for Howle and James Franklin, it was over. Henderson began picking up offers, but committed to the Nittany Lions as a junior. Henderson’s addition, with more tight ends potentially on the way, makes it clear that the position will not be ignored in 2026 like it was last season.\n\nHenderson is a big get for Virginia Tech. Not only are the Hokies bringing a talented prospect back home, but Henderson’s best football is ahead of him. He should be an immediate contributor next season.",

He can also earn another $1.5 million if he’s named AP MVP.\n\nConsidering his statistical output this season, it’s extremely unlikely Rodgers will see the $1.5 million tied to an MVP award, but Pittsburgh’s Week 18 win over Baltimore puts him on the doorstep of another massive payday if the Steelers can defeat the Houston Texans on Monday, January 12, at 8:00 p.m. EST.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers' Aaron Rodgers earns $500,000 with win over Ravens",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers swept a weekend back-to-back against the Memphis Grizzlies, capped by Sunday night’s 120-114 win that extended their undefeated mark in clutch games this season.\n\nThe result offered an encouraging sign that LeBron James and Luka Dončić can close games even as the team continues to battle defensive shortcomings.\n\nThe NBA defines clutch time as any situation in which the score is within five points during the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime.\n\nEvery team in the league has dropped at least three clutch-time games this season. The Lakers, however, improved to 12-0, including a 2-0 start to the new year against Memphis.\n\nThe contrast has been stark. In games that never reach clutch time, Los Angeles is just 10-11, and the Lakers have shown a tendency to get blown out, particularly against championship contenders.\n\nWith such a small sample size, it’s difficult to draw sweeping conclusions about what consistently works late in games.\n\n“I don’t know what the updated numbers are,” Lakers head coach JJ Redick said before the Memphis series, according to The Athletic. “Our defense has been really good in the clutch.” Redick is usually critical of the Lakers’ defensive performance this season.\n\nOn Sunday, the offense sealed it. Dončić took control late and finished with 36 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, while James added 26 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nThe Lakers will be traveling to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans on Tuesday, a day later they will be in San Antonio to play Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs.",

    "fullText": "AJ Dybantsa has lived up to his billing this season as the potential No. 1 overall selection in the 2026 NBA draft. The BYU 18-year-old freshman — originally from Brockton — is dominating college basketball defenders at the moment.\n\nEarlier in the season, Dybantsa dropped 25 points at Madison Square Garden in front of Jaylen Brown and Derrick White in attendance, and AJ has stockpiled those kinds of scoring performances as the season has gone on.\n\nBleacher Report’s Andy Bailey recently predicted that Dybantsa will indeed be the first pick in the draft, despite competition from two other guys.\n\n“Right now, there are three very real contenders to be the top pick in the 2026 draft: Cameron Boozer, Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa,” Bailey wrote on January 1.\n\n“All three have been incredibly productive as freshmen. And the talent gaps between them (assuming there are any) are small enough that it might come down to which team wins the lottery.”\n\n“If someone needs a bigger forward, Boozer would be the pick,” Bailey continued. “A team in need of a dynamic lead guard could go with Peterson. But Dybantsa checks boxes that both of the others do, and wing is the easiest player archetype to build around. And if Dybantsa keeps playing through conference games the way he has in his last six appearances (when he’s averaged 27.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.3 steals), he’ll enter the summer with a ton of momentum.”\n\nPotential No. 1 pick AJ Dybantsa's last 7 games:\n\n24 PTS | 8-15 FG | 8 REB | 3 AST\n33 PTS | 11-13 FG | 10 REB | 10 AST\n35 PTS | 9-12 FG | 6 REB | 4 AST\n23 PTS | 8-14 FG | 10 REB\n26 PTS | 11-17 FG | 8 REB | 7 AST\n28 PTS | 9-17 FG | 9 REB | 6 AST\n22 PTS | 10-15 FG | 5 REB | 5 AST pic.twitter.com/2LkrcwPCqO\n\n— B/R Hoops (@brhoops) January 3, 2026\n\nDybantsa has electrified BYU basketball in his first 14 games played. The 6-foot-8 wing, a preseason AP All-American, joined the Cougars after reclassifying and committing in late 2024.\n\nEarly on in the season, Dybantsa faced challenges, including a narrow 86-84 loss to UConn where he contributed despite team struggles. But he ignited in December. His standout effort came against Clemson on December 9, engineering a 22-point comeback by scoring or assisting on 34 of BYU’s 45 second-half points in a 67-64 victory. He followed with a career-high 35 points versus Abilene Christian and made NCAA history on December 23 against Eastern Washington, posting the youngest-ever 30-point triple-double: 33 points on 11-of-13 shooting, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.\n\nEntering Big 12 play, Dybantsa earned Lute Olson National Player of the Week on December 15 and Big 12 Player of the Week on December 30. In the conference opener on January 3, he scored 24 points despite seven turnovers, leading No. 10 BYU to an 83-73 road win over Kansas State, extending their streak to 10 victories. Through early January, he’s averaging 23.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 3.8 assists on 59.1 percent shooting, positioning BYU as a Final Four contender while solidifying his NBA Draft stock.\n\nLeBron James Retirement Timeline Predicted By Andy Bailey",

    "title": "Terry Francona Makes Feelings Clear on One Reds Player After Disappointing 2025",
    "description": "The Cincinnati Reds need a big 2026 from Matt McClain.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Reds have not had the offseason many fans hoped they would. After showing interest in hometown slugger Kyle Schwarber in MLB free agency, the Reds seemed to be positioning themselves as spenders this winter. Instead, the team missed out on Schwarber, and has done very little to reallocate the money they offered him.\n\nIf they remain unable to make any meaningful additions in free agency, Cincinnati will become even more reliant on internal progression in 2026. No player fits this category better than infielder Matt McLain.\n\nBursting onto the scene in 2023, McLain posted a 127 OPS+ in his rookie season. He missed all of the 2024 campaign due to left shoulder surgery, and returned in 2025 much less productive than his first campaign. With an OPS+ of just 74, McLain was well below league average last season. It was this drop-off in production that had many Reds fans clamoring for a middle-of-the-order addition this winter, incase McLain never returns to his 2023 form.\n\nRoundtable Rundown podcast breaks down the Reds' MLB offseason\n\nChicago White Sox outfielder Luis Robert has been floated as a potential Reds option, but that momentum seems to have cooled in recent weeks. For now, the Reds remain confident that McLain can bounce back.\n\n\"I think it's probably the first time he's ever struggled, anywhere, and to do it at the Major League level is probably a hard place to learn,\" Reds manager Terry Francona said (via MLB.com). \"But he's a very competitive kid.\"\n\nThe veteran manager added, \"In my opinion, he's probably our best baserunner,\" Francona said. \"I don't mean fastest, but I mean he always knows where the ball is. He runs the bases like a veteran. He plays second base, he knows where the ball is supposed to go. The ball jumps off his bat way more than you would think when you look at his stature. I think that shoulder -- you talk to guys that have had that, and they've kind of said the same thing. Like, 'I played, but it wasn't the same.'\"\n\nTo a lesser degree, the Reds also saw star shortstop Elly De La Cruz take a step back in 2025. While he was still an All-Star, his numbers were mostly down across the board from the year prior. If both he and McLain can regain their peak form in 2026, the Reds failing to make a big offseason splash will hurt less. But if that doesn't happen, many will point back to this winter as where things went wrong for Cincinnati.",

    "fullText": "Former Manchester United right back Gary Neville has named the Chelsea player who is a “smidgen away from Eden Hazard.”\n\nBut he’s wrong here, and this is just a very daft comparison in my opinion.\n\nPedro Neto is more like his namesake Pedro, who used to play as a winger at Chelsea, rather than being anything near Eden Hazard’s levels. And after his awful performance against Manchester City last night, comparing him with Hazard cannot be any further from reality.\n\nThe Blues scraped a 1-1 draw away at City last night after Enzo Fernandez bundled in a late equalising goal for the manager-less Chelsea side.\n\nCaptain Reece James was explaining the ‘different plan’ that the team had at the start of the game, as they needed to switch things up at half time to get something from the game.\n\nPedro Neto in action for Chelsea. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images)\n\nGary Neville sometimes gets his opinions spot on. But the majority of the time, I just find myself disagreeing with him.\n\nNeville said on Pedro Neto after the City draw yesterday:\n\n“He bloody frustrated me like you won’t believe. He’s a smidgen away from being an Eden Hazard, but he’s never going to be an Eden Hazard because he hasn’t got that beautiful sort of glide about him. But he was also a killer, and you’ve got to be a killer in those types of positions.”\n\nThat bit was correct, Neto was hugely frustrating yesterday. I think he was breaking down more of our own attacks than the defensive City players were!\n\nHe needs to get much better with his decision making and his quality overall.",

    "fullText": "At the final whistle at the Etihad Stadium yesterday there was an overwhelming sense that Manchester City had thrown away two points against Chelsea. Enzo Fernandez scored for Chelsea in the 94th minute to cancel out Tijjani Reijnders first-half goal to ensure that yesterday’s match finished 1-all. Pep Guardiola’s side ran out of legs as fatigue and injuries caught up to them in the game’s closing stages. City were also left cursing the fact that they couldn’t convert a plethora of good positions into goals or chances. As the final whistle blew there was also another factor that stood out. This Manchester City side is still learning and they have a way to go to become a fully-fledged Pep Guardiola side.\n\nIn years gone by, Manchester City would easily control the closing stages of a match like last night’s. Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering City side would not let their opponents have possession and they’d typically see out the closing stages of matches like last night’s with ease. But that didn’t occur at the Etihad against Chelsea last night. Instead, Pep Guardiola’s side ran out of legs. Injuries and fatigue caught up to City. With tired legs and tired minds, the decision-making of this City side wilted.\n\nManchester City couldn’t control the final stages of last night’s match. They left the door open for Chelsea to nick a point. Instead of closing the game down and controlling possession, City kept trying to do much on the ball or defensively rather than doing the simple things. In truth, City should have two or three goals up by the time Enzo Fernandez equalised for Chelsea. But they weren’t. Pep Guardiola’s side should have kept possession, but they were unable to do so late on last night. There was an immaturity to Manchester City’s play late in yesterday’s match. That immaturity cost City dearly.\n\nThe passage of play that led to Chelsea’s equaliser showed the immaturity in Pep Guardiola’s side. Rayan Cherki picked up possession on the right wing and played a chip to Bernardo Silva. Manchester City’s captain lost possession while trying to keep the ball. Chelsea midfielder Andrey Santos took the ball from Bernardo and attempted to surge forward from midfield. Bernardo pulled down Andrey Santos and picked up a yellow card. Chelsea worked the ball from the free kick out wide to Malo Gusto. Nico O’Reilly stepped up to challenge to high up the pitch at on Chelsea’s right wing. Gusto rounded O’Reilly and set up Enzo Fernandez’s late equaliser.\n\nThose two pieces of play from Cherki and O’Reilly highlighted the immaturity in City’s play. They’ll both learn from what occurred last night as will this new-look Manchester City side. It was a harsh lesson for them to learn but one that should serve this City side well in time.\n\nThe way Manchester City conceded the late equaliser to Chelsea doesn’t fall solely on Rayan Cherki and Nico O’Reilly. It is a lesson this City side must learn together. Under Pep Guardiola you do think they will. There were mitigating factors at play in the game’s closing stages last night. The City players were tired and Rodri had run out of steam. The loss of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol also hurt Pep Guardiola’s team. But there was enough leadership and experience on the pitch to prevent what occurred late in yesterday’s match from happening. But it wasn’t to be.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s draw with Chelsea, Rodri explained that his team must learn from yesterday’s disappointing draw to Chelsea. Speaking on what occurred, Rodri said: “It’s frustrating of course but at the end it is what it is. We created enough chances to win the game three or four-nil, but this is football. If you don’t take your chances with nothing they just draw the game.”\n\n“So we have to learn from this. There is still a long way and we just need to focus on the next games. First half was brilliant, enough to score three or four goals. In the second half, we forgot a little bit how to play and they got control of the game, losing easy balls.”\n\n“Sometimes when you defend, defend, defend, they did not have much but they get a draw. There’s still a long way to go.”\n\n“Injuries unbalances the team, every single time a player goes out [injured] but of course, the team has to adjust. It is not an excuse, we have enough talented players to play but in the second half we lose face a bit.”\n\nManchester City should have beaten Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium last night. But they failed to take full advantage of their openings and they couldn’t sustain control of last night’s match as the second-half wore on. There is a lesson to be learned from last night’s result for this City side and come the final whistle it was apparent that this iteration of Pep Guardiola’s side still has a lot to learn. That process is ongoing and it will take time as we saw last night when Manchester City couldn’t gain control of last night’s match when they desperately needed to.",

    "description": "“If you haven’t yet made the trip to Hetton this season, now is the perfect time!”",
    "fullText": "Before we dive in, it’s worth saying clearly that this article hasn’t been written to push an agenda, to guilt-trip anyone or to suggest that “real” supporters must attend women’s football, as Sunderland AFC is a broad, passionate community, and people support the club in many different ways.\n\nThis guide simply exists to help those who might be interested — whether you’re a lifelong fan, a curious groundhopper, someone looking for an affordable family day out or a supporter who follows the men’s team and wants to explore another part of the club. It’s an invitation, not an obligation, and a celebration of another vibrant corner of the Sunderland football family.\n\nWomen’s football has grown enormously in recent years, but it remains a space where new supporters are welcomed with open arms, so if you’ve ever wondered what a matchday is like, how to get to Eppleton or what the atmosphere feels like, this guide is here to help.\n\nThe Lasses deserve recognition for the commitment, talent, and spirit they bring to the pitch, and it’s always lovely to see all aspects of Sunderland AFC being supported — but only ever in ways that feel right for each individual. If this article helps even one person discover a new matchday experience they enjoy, it’s done its job.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge that the 2025/2026 season hasn’t been straightforward. It’s been turbulent, challenging, and at times frustrating — the kind of campaign where results haven’t always reflected the effort on the pitch.\n\nYet there’s something undeniably special about being present during seasons like this.\n\nYou feel part of the graft, the rebuilding process and the determination to turn things around. There’s cautious optimism growing among supporters; a sense that despite the difficulties, the foundations for a stronger second half of the season are in place. Being witness to that journey, from the lows, the resilience and the potential upswing is its own unique experience, and one that many fans cherish.\n\nThe matchday experience at Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground has become a cherished part of the club’s identity, and the atmosphere surrounding the team reflects the pride, passion, and community spirit that Sunderland supporters are known for.\n\nEppleton, located in Hetton-le-Hole, has been the home of the Lasses for several seasons now, and it remains one of the most welcoming and intimate grounds in the women’s game. Even in a difficult season, attendances have held firm, with families, young fans, and longstanding supporters all coming together to cheer on a team that embodies the region’s footballing heritage.\n\nThis season has been a test of character.\n\nSunderland Women have faced injuries, frustrating defeats and moments where momentum slipped away just as it seemed to be building. Yet through all of this, the squad has shown resilience and flashes of real quality in their last two competitive games, and a 4-0 win away to Sheffield United at the start of the season showed what the Lasses can achieve when they play expansive attacking football.\n\nThe blend of experienced players and emerging young talent remains one of the team’s strengths, and even in tough matches, there have been performances that hint at what the side is capable of when everything clicks.\n\nHome form has been mixed, but Eppleton continues to be a place where the Lasses dig deep. The tight pitch and vocal support create an atmosphere that can unsettle visiting teams — and several matches have showcased the grit and determination that supporters know this squad possesses.\n\nWhilst the first half of the season has been difficult, there’s a growing sense of belief that the second half could bring a resurgence — the kind of turnaround that makes following football so compelling.\n\nEppleton Colliery Welfare Ground is a quintessential North East football venue: compact, characterful, and deeply rooted in the community.\n\nIt offers an intimate matchday experience where supporters are close to the action and where the connection between players and fans feels genuine and immediate. The ground has a capacity of around 2,500, including a 250-seat covered stand that provides shelter and a traditional vantage point for those who prefer to sit.\n\nStanding areas wrap around the pitch, giving supporters the freedom to choose their preferred spot. Many regulars enjoy standing along the railings, where the proximity to the pitch allows them to feel every tackle, cheer every goal and share in the emotion of the match.\n\nFacilities include a matchday café, well-managed turnstiles, and parking around the ground — though arriving early is wise for busier fixtures.\n\nEppleton is well-connected, making it easy for supporters across the region to attend.\n\nFrom Sunderland, regular bus services run from the interchange to Hetton, with stops just a short walk from the ground. The journey typically takes twenty-five to thirty-five minutes, and on matchdays you’ll often find yourself travelling alongside other supporters, adding to the sense of community before you even arrive.\n\nFrom Durham, buses also run directly to Hetton, with journey times of around thirty to forty minutes. Many students and families use this route, making it a popular option.\n\nFor those driving, the A690 provides a straightforward route, with clear signage leading into Hetton. Parking is available near the ground, though spaces can be limited during high-attendance matches.\n\nTickets for Sunderland AFC Women continue to offer some of the best value in the women’s game.\n\nPrices for the 2025/2026 season are intentionally affordable, ensuring that matchdays remain accessible for families, students, and supporters of all ages. Tickets can be purchased online through the club’s official website, with options for digital tickets or collection at the ground. Adult tickets are priced at £10; over 65’s £8 and under 22’s £6.\n\nIt should be worth adding that if you’re interested in a season ticket, the Lasses have always offered incredibly affordable football, with “early bird” season tickets priced at £50 for adults, £40 for concessions (over 65s) and £20 for under-14s and students, offering fantastic value for fans.\n\nBuying in advance is recommended for busier fixtures, but tickets are also available at the turnstiles on the day. Entry is smooth and well-organised, with friendly staff and volunteers helping to create a welcoming matchday atmosphere.\n\nSunderland Women typically play their home matches on Sundays at 2pm.\n\nThis regular slot offers familiarity for supporters and makes attending matches easy to plan around. The Sunday afternoon timing is particularly family-friendly, contributing to the relaxed and inclusive feel of matchdays at Eppleton.\n\nOccasionally, fixtures may be moved for broadcast or cup commitments, but the club communicates any changes clearly through its official channels.\n\nThe 2025/2026 season has brought a major boost to accessibility.\n\nEvery WSL2 match is now streamed live and free on the WSL2 YouTube channel. This means supporters can follow the Lasses from anywhere in the world. Highlights are uploaded later for those who miss the live broadcast.\n\nFor fans who prefer text updates, the Sunderland AFC Women’s Twitter account provides live play-by-play commentary during every match — a great option if you’re on the move or unable to watch the stream.\n\nOf course, nothing compares to being there in person, as the energy, the closeness to the action, and the sense of belonging are unmatched.\n\nAttending a Sunderland Women’s match is more than just watching football: it’s a community experience where supporters of all ages come together. The atmosphere is friendly, inclusive, and full of passion, and whether you choose to sit in the stand or stand along the railings, you’ll have an excellent view of the pitch.\n\nThe café provides refreshments throughout the match, offering hot drinks and snacks that feel just right on a cool North East afternoon. Volunteers and staff contribute to the warm, community-driven feel that makes Eppleton special.\n\nOne of the most cherished traditions is the post-match interaction between players and supporters. Regardless of the result, the players always come over to sign autographs, take photos, and chat.\n\nThis connection is one of the defining features of the women’s game and a highlight for many fans — especially younger supporters.\n\nTo stay connected with the team, here are the key accounts and supporter groups!\n\nSunderland AFC Women (Instagram)\n\nSunderland AFC Women (Facebook)\n\nSunderland AFC Women Supporters Group (Twitter)\n\nSunderland AFC Women Supporters Group (Instagram)\n\nSunderland AFC Women Supporters Group (Facebook)\n\nThe 2025/2026 season may have been turbulent so far, but that’s part of what makes this moment so compelling.\n\nSupporting a team through difficult spells creates a deeper connection, as you feel part of the journey, the effort and the determination to improve. And when the tide turns — as many supporters believe it can in the second half of the season —being able to say you were there through it all is something special.\n\nThe matchday experience at Eppleton is warm, welcoming and deeply rooted in the community.\n\nThe affordability of tickets, quality of football and family-friendly atmosphere make it an ideal outing for supporters of all kinds, and whether you’re a lifelong fan or someone considering attending your first match, you’ll find something meaningful at Eppleton.\n\nIf you haven’t yet made the trip to Hetton this season, now is the perfect time. The Lasses are fighting; the atmosphere is electric at times, and the community is ready to welcome you. There’s nothing quite like being part of it!",

    "title": "2 Up, 2 Down: Brobbey Slams Sunderland Towards A Share Of The Spoils!",
    "description": "Our writers react to the Lads’ 1-1 draw with Spurs, as Brian Brobbey’s equaliser proved vital!",
    "fullText": "I think Brian Brobbey has been really good recently and the goal he scored against Spurs was probably the best we’ve scored all season, although you have to give credit to Omar Alderete, Nordi Mukiele, Granit Xhaka and in particular Enzo Le Fée for their part in it, too.\n\nIt was a superb team effort and the way he lashed it home was fantastic — he absolutely wellied it into the net.\n\nHopefully this is the start of a purple patch for the big man, who looks a real threat up top and is showing why we paid so much money for him.\n\nWe were naff in the first half — more on that later — but we responded really well after half time and I don’t think there can be any denying that we deserved to get back into the game.\n\nWe really improved after the break and the Lads came out and really gave it their all; in fact, I think in the end Spurs could probably count themselves as lucky to have escaped with only a point.\n\nIt felt like one of those games where if it had gone on another ten minutes we’d have probably got a second goal, but alas, we take the point and move on — and considering how decent Spurs were in the opening forty five, it was probably a fair result.\n\nI think you could see particularly in the first half that the lads were a little fatigued from a gruelling runout against Manchester City a few days ago, but that was no excuse for just how bad our passing was in the opening half of the game.\n\nThe amount of times we conceded possession was ridiculous and so unlike us.\n\nThankfully, we fixed it in the second period and Spurs never took advantage, but we have to be careful that we aren’t that bad against Brentford as they’re confident and would surely take advantage of such massive lapses in concentration.\n\nI don’t think the shape we started the game with was working and whilst Régis Le Bris eventually sorted it out, we could’ve been put to bed in that first half if Spurs had been better, so we probably should’ve changed things up sooner.\n\nScored a brilliantly taken equaliser to top off an excellent second half performance.\n\nAfter a quiet first half he battled for the second forty five minutes, was everywhere across the pitch and his willingness to track back was tremendous.\n\nThe likes of Rodrigo Bentancur, Cristian Romero and Pedro Porro will be glad they don’t have to deal with him every week, as even their typical shithousery failed with our big striker coming out on top.\n\nHow Le Fée keeps running is beyond me.\n\nI thought Sadiki was our “energiser bunny” in the middle of the park but even after a breathless game against Manchester City, Le Fée still clocked up the miles and his second half showing was as if he’d had a week to recover. Unlucky to not score with a brilliant run and deft header, but his first-time ball to assist Brobbey was excellent.\n\nAs for Geertruida, I love this lad.\n\nAs an opposition manager, you don’t know how to deal with him as he plays everywhere — although the more I watch, I love him in the middle of the park.\n\nHis reading of the game was superb; he has such a great understanding with Granit Xhaka and Le Fée that it may mean when AFCON finishes, Habib Diarra and Sadiki won’t just walk back into the starting eleven.\n\nThe fight he showed when getting at Bentancur was great to see as well. Can we sign him permanently, please?\n\nCountless times in the first half, we were nearly the victim of our own downfall by needlessly and aimlessly giving the ball away through misdirected passes or being too casual when trying to get the ball forward.\n\nLuckily, Spurs didn’t know what to do with it either so we only went in 1-0 down at half time.\n\nThis was the Adingra we saw at the start of the season, sadly.\n\nJust when you thought he’d turned a corner, his performance was as poor as we’ve seen from him in a Sunderland shirt — and it didn’t help that his immediate replacement in Mundle didn’t offer much more, either.\n\nI feel like Mundle lacks the awareness to the pace the league requires to be successful, as he’s often caught on the ball or closed down before he can move it off to another player.\n\nHe definitely hasn’t found the rhythm when trying to beat his man, so maybe a start against Everton in the FA Cup could help with this?\n\nI feared the worst after the first half performance as we looked leggy and unmotivated, but the Lads turned it around in brilliant fashion in a much rejuvenated second half display.\n\nWe’ve played four games so far during this AFCON- affected period — all resulting in well-fought draws — and this was no exception.\n\nA great fightback from the brink to take something back to Wearside\n\nHe had a tough first half with not much to work with, but my word — did he take his chance when it came.\n\nA brilliant passing move all the way from Omar Alderete, set up beautifully by Enzo Le Fée with the one-two and finished with thunderous volley into the top corner.\n\nNo chance for their goalkeeper (or any goalkeeper for that matter). and it also seemed to really motivate Brobbey, who stepped his performance up a gear after the goal.\n\nTheir goal was poor and epitomised our first half perfromance.\n\nThere shouldn’t be a man left totally unmarked at the back post and he shouldn’t be able to take a touch and pick a pass. We should’ve been faster to react, to press the ball and block the shot, but we weren’t, and it was very frustrating to see.\n\nMundle was really poor off the bench.\n\nI really like him and clearly Régis Le Bris does too, but he’s done next to nothing with the opportunities that he’s been given. He’s a very talented player and I have faith that eventually it’ll click into place, but if you’re going to be the first substitute, coming on, you’re expected to make more of an impact.\n\nI understand that it’s easier said than done to come on against a Champions League team whilst everyone else has settled into the game, but I’d still like to see more from him — and all the substitutes.\n\nHe came on at 1-0, and it would be easy to be confused at bringing on a defender when we were trying to push forward, but the change in shape and Ballard’s threat up front was a bold move and it turned the game.\n\nAnother great battling performance from the stocky frontman.\n\nHe deserved his goal, and what a blast it was! Spurs were there for the taking and but for a non-existent first half show, we could’ve bagged three points.\n\nBut another point won, and a full ninety and a goal for Brobbey.\n\nThe Lads lacked energy and vigour — you could say that was predictable after the showing against Manchester City — but consistency of levels and performances are key for a good team and we lack consistency at the moment.\n\nThe energy picked up in the second half, but we didn’t show up early on.\n\nThe passing was also missing for large parts of the game and it was almost like watching a team of strangers at times.\n\nMiscommunication, sloppy passes and not on the same page as each other. Very strange and very unusual but thankfully, we woke up to warm everyone up.\n\nI’m now at  the point where if we are in the game at half time we will get something  out of it because Regis is so tactically aware we are a different side in the  second half. He did an amazing job to sort the team out for the final 45 minutes.\n\nSo good to see Dan back on the pitch. He is so important to this side.\n\nSo disappointed with our winger.\n\nHe and Brian Brobbey were Sunderland’s “out ball” today and it was so frustrating as he didn’t show up in the first half.\n\nThe home crowd, a huge stadium…and they were awful.\n\nI was in the home end and they were silent.\n\nHowever dire your team is, you need to get behind them. They turned away minutes into the game and it just shows what we deliver week after week.\n\nAfter a difficult first half, we came out with renewed vigour in the second half and were the better team thereafter.\n\nNot only did we defend doggedly as a team, we got forward and could easily have won the game.\n\nWe were very inventive going forward after the break.\n\nBrian Brobbey had arguably his best game for Sunderland — not only scoring a superb goal but holding the ball up and bringing others into play. He’s looking fitter with every game and did his fair share of pressing and defending too.\n\nGranit Xhaka dictated our play, Enzo Le Fée came to life and both Trai Hume and Nordi Mukiele got forward to support the attack.\n\nIn the first, half we looked leggy — which was understandable — but Régis Le Bris wasn’t frightened to make changes to make us more of a threat and take pressure off our defence.\n\nDan Ballard’s introduction enabled Lutsharel Geertruida to move into midfield, while Spurs could never settle with Romaine Mundle on the left, Simon Adingra switching to the right and Mukiele getting forward from right back.\n\nWe were possibly running on empty after Manchester City but after a slow start, our adrenaline and “til the end” mentality saw us through once again.\n\nI think fatigue could well be an issue but with few options for rotation, the Lads are really putting in a shift to see us through until the African players return.\n\nDuring the second half, everyone stepped up and Spurs knew they were in a game.\n\nWe were very competitive in midfield and defence, and our attack came to dynamic life in the final thirty minutes of the game. For once we were ahead in the overall possession stats., and we could easily have left this impressive stadium with all three points.\n\nThe players stayed after the whistle to celebrate with the travelling fans. long after the home team had disappeared down the tunnel.\n\nIf anyone needed convincing about Brobbey, this was the input over ninety-plus minutes that any doubters needed. It was a sensational performance from our number nine which showed that he’s reached full fitness and has bought into the current Sunderland ethos.\n\nHe showed massive awareness and was a constant pest to the home defence. The goal itself — a one-two with Enzo Le Fée followed by a powerful finish into the top corner — was a thing of beauty.\n\nThere was a low-key feel to the first half.\n\nSpurs were a bit hesitant given their poor home record, and we started slowly — did we really show up? This wasn’t surprising given how draining the last couple of home games have been, given AFCON and other absences.\n\nIn the second half, we shook off our shackles and came forward very effectively.\n\nIt’s fine saying that we are unbeaten in the last 5 games, with one defeat in eight, but the truth is that we’ve only won twogames since Stamford Bridge in October.\n\nWe need a couple of wins to lift us back into European qualification.\n\nIn some ways I can’t believe I’m. writing this as we still need to reach forty points, but Sunderland’s performances have raised the expectations of all fans.\n\nIt was a great build up, with Enzo Le Fée showing a great touch to play the ball into Brobbey’s path — and the finish itself was emphatic.\n\nAt that stage it was nothing less than we deserved and it was a timely contribution from Brobbey himself, who’s been playing well enough in recent weeks but with little reward and now finding Eliezer Mayenda breathing down his neck for the centre forward role.\n\nAs the second half wore on and with Sunderland still a goal down despite taking control of the game, you had to wonder if it was going to be one of those days where it just wasn’t going to go our way.\n\nHowever, this is a Sunderland team that all the pundits like to emphasise has plenty of spirit and togetherness while also not waking up at this point going into the New Year to what all us fans know — we have quality in there too.\n\nIt was quality that crafted our equaliser and you cant go to a place like Tottenham and look the more likely winner without having something more than grit and huff and puff.\n\nIt was worrying to face the possibility that Dan Ballard could’ve faced a lengthy spell out injured as he’s made himself a key player for us this season.\n\nSeeing him back on the pitch in the second half was good news and with Ballard hopefully returning to our starting eleven, it’ll give us more options, with either a five at the back or someone else to move forward.\n\nEither way, our defence looks more solid with him in the middle.\n\nI can’t really moan as this was our second game in a few days, but Tottenham looked like they had an extra yard on us in the first half and deserved to be leading at the break.\n\nThat said, it’s over ninety minutes and not forty five, so maybe “the entitled” down at White Hart Lane need to look at their own game plan after they came flying out of the blocks in the first half.\n\nWe looked the more likely winners by the time the full time whistle had gone.",

The loss is Illinois’ worst in the NET rankings this season.\n\nThe win over the Illini (15-8, 7-6 Big Ten) is the first victory over a ranked opponents for the Scarlet Knights (12-11, 5-7 Big Ten) this season.\n\nIf you tuned in midway through the second half, you might have trouble believing that Illinois was being steamrolled early to start this game.\n\nThe game began slow for Illinois. Despite entering Wednesday as the nation’s best rebounding team in the nation, weakness in that area combined with shooting woes and a concerning level of ball security saw the Illini fall behind early.\n\nIn a game that fielded four players who are expecting to hear their names called at the NBA Draft in June, injury returnee Dylan Harper shined the brightest. Harper was coming off of a high ankle sprain that had sidelined him from Rutgers’ last two games.\n\nPaired with him was his red-hot running mate Ace Bailey, who had ten points in the first ten minutes to create a huge early advantage for the hosts.\n\nIn a game where Kasparas Jakucionis continued to struggle on the offensive end, Will Riley took over the reigns for a second straight game, scoring a team-high 20 points. 13 of those points came in the second half, where Illinois worked its way back to seize the lead after trailing by as many as 17.\n\nOnce the Illini did start to get back into the game, it came thanks to the Scarlet Knights hitting a brick wall themselves. A three-minute stretch in the mid-to-late first half saw the hosts go 1-for-8 on field goals, which gave Illinois a 48-47 lead, its first advantage since leading 2-0 to open the evening.",

    "fullText": "Paul Mullin's loan spell with Wigan Athletic has been cut short and the striker will return to Wrexham this week.\n\nManager Phil Parkinson confirmed the move after Sunday's 2-1 victory at Derby County which moved the north Wales club to within a point of the Championship play-offs.\n\n\"Mulls' loan spell has been terminated,\" said Parkinson.\n\n\"We'll have a chat with him this week when he comes back in. He needs to train this week as he's missed a few days of training.\"\n\nMullin, 31, played a pivotal role in Wrexham's three successive promotions under Hollywood duo Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac, scoring 110 goals in 170 games and enjoying a prominent role in the Welcome to Wrexham documentary series.\n\nHowever, following the Red Dragons' promotion to the Championship last season, he joined the League One Latics on loan for the duration of the 2025-26 campaign.\n\nMullin scored five times in 26 appearances for Wigan and leaves the Brick Community Stadium having been omitted from each of the club's past four matchday squads.\n\n\"I've only spoken to him briefly over the Christmas period,\" added Parkinson.\n\n\"We haven't really been in training much because of the games and staying in hotels.\n\n\"I'll touch base with him on the way back today and we'll have a good chat when he comes in this week.\"\n\nMullin's Wrexham journey - timeline of a cult hero\n\n'Farewell to Wrexham' - a ruthless success story\n\n'I can't imagine Mullin in a different kit' - Reynolds\n\nMullin, Wrexham's seventh-highest scorer of all time, is under contract at the Stok Cae Ras until the summer of 2027 but has suffered with recurring injury problems in recent seasons, including lower back, knee and hamstring issues.\n\nHe joined Wrexham in the summer of 2021, dropping down to the National League from League One Shrewsbury.\n\nHe scored 38 league goals in Wrexham's 2022-23 National League title success, following it up with 24 goals in League Two.\n\nHowever, despite maintaining his cult following with the Hollywood owned club - including a surprise cameo in the Marvel comic book film, Deadpool & Wolverine - Mullin was on the sidelines for much of last season as Wrexham went up to the second tier.\n\nHe scored only five goals in 32 appearances and could not even make the bench in the final few months of the campaign. His last appearance for the north Wales club was as a second half substitute in a 2-2 draw with Peterborough in February 2025.\n\nWigan have also seen another player leave the club early to return to Wales this month, with Swansea City opting to recall 26-year-old Wales midfielder Ollie Cooper.\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior is as good a coach as Wayne Rooney has worked with and deserves the chance to be Chelsea manager - with the former England striker fondly remembering their time together at Derby County.\n\nStrasbourg boss Rosenior is the leading candidate to become the new boss at Chelsea, who have the same owners as the French club.\n\nEnglishman Rosenior, 41, was Rooney's assistant boss at Derby in 2021 and 2022, and he became the interim Rams boss in League One after the Manchester United legend's departure.\n\nHe then managed Hull City before being sacked, despite just missing out on the Championship play-offs, moving to Strasbourg in 2024.\n\n\"He's taken chances, and hopefully that pays off because I think Liam is as good a coach as I've ever worked with,\" Rooney said on the BBC's Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"His detail, how he approaches the day-to-day, he's as good as I've worked with.\"\n\nRooney has managed DC United, Birmingham City and Plymouth Argyle since leaving Derby and now works in the media, including his BBC podcast.\n\n\"Liam was so important for me,\" said Rooney. \"He was incredible in his coaching ability. I was more of the manager and dealing with players and everything.\n\n\"So I learned a lot from him from that point of view and then I think he's done a great job as a whole.\"\n\nAmorim’s strange comments & Rosenior will be great at Chelsea! - listen to Wayne Rooney podcast\n\n'Good idea' or taking 'massive chance' - is Rosenior ready for Chelsea?\n\nRooney said he has \"no doubts\" that Rosenior could do a good job for Chelsea.\n\nEnzo Maresca left his role at the Blues after 18 months in charge, having fallen out with the club's owners.\n\nThe last time Rosenior worked in the Premier League was as a player for Brighton in 2017.\n\nAs a right-back, he had a solid but unspectacular career as a player - also featuring in the top flight for Fulham, Reading and Hull.\n\nRoughly half his career was spent in the EFL and that is where he started his coaching career.\n\nAfter a spell as Brighton's under-23s coach, he spent three years at Derby - working with Phillip Cocu before Rooney.\n\n\"He's also got a side which you don't want to cross him as well,\" said Rooney.\n\n\"That's important as well. If he goes in there, he won't disappoint. He's been waiting for an opportunity like this.\n\n\"If you don't take it now, then you're never going to take it. And I think he's done his apprenticeship, he's done his work to try and get to that job.\n\n\"So he'll have no doubts in his mind that he's capable of doing that job. And hopefully, very soon, hopefully we hear that he is the manager, because for young English coaches I think it's massive.\n\n\"We don't really see English managers at big clubs. So he'd be leading the way for for us.\"\n\nThe only English managers currently in the Premier League are Newcastle's Eddie Howe, Burnley's Scott Parker and Nottingham Forest's Sean Dyche.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "While the Commanders were playing on Sunday, another team signed its star LT to a big contract. Laremy Tunsil was paying attention.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders completed their regular season Sunday, defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 24-17 to finish the season 5-12. Several starters missed Sunday's game for the Commanders, including five-time Pro Bowl left tackle Laremy Tunsil.\n\nDuring Sunday's game, Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network broke some news: the Seattle Seahawks, who clinched the NFC West and NFC's No. 1 overall seed on Saturday night, had agreed to a four-year extension with left tackle Charles Cross. The numbers: 4 years, $104.4 million — $26.1 million average per year, with $40.5 million due to Cross in year one of the deal. Rapoport also said that Cross would receive $75 million in guaranteed money.\n\nTunsil was paying attention and shared the following message on his Instagram.\n\nLet's the games begin! #Commanders LT Laremy Tunsil latest IG post! #RaiseCheckbook pic.twitter.com/xGzi6rH31m\n\n— Deuce_Redzone (@redzoneinthelab) January 5, 2026\n\nNot only did Tunsil share the news on Instagram, but he also reposted Rapoport's message on X.\n\nThis is notable because Tunsil has one year remaining on his contract and has made it clear he wants a new deal.\n\n\"Whatever happens, happens,” Tunsil told Tashan Reed of The Washington Post last month. \"Of course, I want to be paid. Of course, I want to stay with this organization.......When we get to the offseason, we can handle it.\"\n\nTunsil has earned a new contract. When the Commanders acquired him in March from the Houston Texans, he had two years remaining on a contract extension he signed in 2023. However, there were no guarantees remaining.\n\nTunsil started the first 14 games of the season for Washington, and he was outstanding. Coaches and teammates praised him for his leadership and on-field play. Offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury said he was surprised at how good a run blocker Tunsil was. Tunsil also served as a mentor for first-round tackle Josh Conerly Jr.\n\nHowever, an oblique injury in Week 15 led the Commanders to sideline him for the remainder of the season.\n\nTunsil's intentions are clear: he wants to be paid. The good news is that Washington has plenty of cap space and a young quarterback to protect. Tunsil is in a unique position, having already signed two extensions since entering the NFL back in 2016. He's reset the market twice. It's easy to forget that Tunsil is still only 31 and plans to keep playing, much like former Washington tackle Trent Williams.\n\nHow much will Tunsil receive? Cross is 25, so Washington may not want to pay Tunsil a similar amount. However, Tunsil reposting those messages makes it clear: negotiations will begin at Cross's numbers.\n\nThe Commanders want to keep Tunsil, and he wants to stay. Both sides should be motivated enough to get this done and not allow it to linger into the season as it did with Terry McLaurin in 2025.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Laremy Tunsil looking to get paid again",

    "fullText": "A Dublin man is leading the construction of the world's largest ever telescope. The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is approximately 70% built in the Andes Mountains in Chile.\n\nProfessor Tom Ray is president of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), which is building the telescope.\n\n\"We're talking about a mirror, right, that is 40 metres across,\" he explained on RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"The dome is the size of the Colosseum in Rome, but actually taller than the Colosseum, but roughly about the same width.\"\n\nThe ELT is due to be completed in 2028 and is expected to cost €1.5 billion.\n\n\"It is enormous compared to anything, any sort of telescope that's been built in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"And with it, it would be possible, for example, to not only image Earth-sized planets around nearby stars, but also to explore their atmosphere.\n\n\"We want to see if there's any signs of life on the planet or whether there's any oxygen, the things that would give rise to life.\"\n\nIreland has been a member of ESO since 2019, Prof Ray said there is a lot of Irish input into the ELT project.\n\n\"The University of Galway, for example, is involved in building what we call an adoptive optics,\" he explained this as using lasers to sharpen the images of stars as seen by telescopes.\n\nIreland becoming more prominent in space exploration\n\nSenior Irish scientists say Ireland is becoming more prominent in space exploration, creating more jobs and opportunities.\n\nIn 2025, Ireland successfully completed its first satellite mission in space.\n\nBelfast-born astronaut Dr Rosemary Coogan became a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut this year, through UK government funding.\n\nNorah Patten is expected to go into space on a commercial flight in 2027.\n\nIn March 2025, Ireland joined CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\nAnd scientists in Galway will be among the first to use the ELT when it goes live.\n\nThe scientists are studying a project on exoplanets with Italian scientists, and earlier this year, found the planet WISPIT 2b. It is about 430 light-years away from Earth.\n\nEIRSAT-1: Ireland's first satellite\n\nEIRSAT-1 was launched in January 2023 and burned back into the Earth's atmosphere after successfully completing its mission in September 2025.\n\nProfessor of astronomy, Lorraine Hanlon, director of UCD's Centre for Space Research, led the EIRSAT-1 mission.\n\n\"All of the technology that we created really from our lab to a fully functioning space instrument has been tested,\" Prof Hanlon told RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"Showing that that technology worked, that we were able to put it together and put a full spacecraft together in our labs tells us that we can actually use this technology not only for small satellites, but we can use it as building blocks for much larger instruments that would be even more powerful in the future.\"\n\nDuring the mission, Prof Hanlon's team in UCD detected 12 gamma-ray bursts as well as several solar flares using the EIRSAT-1.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity. Please review their details and accept them to load the content.Manage Preferences\n\nUnlike many ESA member countries, Ireland's does not have its own space agency; instead, Enterprise Ireland runs the country's space programme.\n\nProf Hanon said that Ireland has not necessarily needed a standalone space agency up to now.\n\n\"But I think the case is becoming stronger for some kind of coordinating entity that would oversee education, research through to industry and innovation,\" she said.\n\nIreland's investment in ESA is relatively small compared to other countries; however, it is estimated that the country sees a return of approximately 7:1 on that investment.\n\nFor 2025, Ireland's total contribution to ESA was €26 million. There are at least 116 Irish companies that have a contract with ESA.\n\nMany Irish companies and higher education institutions now have work from membership of organisations such as ESA, ESO and CERN.\n\nProf Hanlon said joining these organisations is worth the membership fees.\n\n\"It means that your scientists are in those collaborations, are defining the experiments that will create the next level of challenge.\n\n\"So, your scientists are defining those problems that need to be addressed.\"\n\nMunster Technological University has already joined a scientific experiment with CERN.\n\nThe ESA is launching the PLATO mission to search for planets around other stars this year, which will include technology from Irish company Réaltra.\n\nAnother Irish company, InnaLabs, has its technology on board another ESA mission called HERA, which will arrive at the Didymos asteroid system in late 2026.\n\nIn UCD, another satellite mission called GIFTS: A 6U CubeSat for the detection and localisation of gamma-ray bursts is currently underway.\n\nAerial, a project with funding from both ESA and ESO, also has Irish involvement.\n\nProf Ray explained: \"What Aerial is doing is looking at a few thousand planets and their atmosphere, but from space.\n\n\"So, we're involved with the constructing of several parts of this and testing them, because they have to be tested at very low temperatures, I'm talking minus 230C because that's what it's like out in space.\"\n\nProf Ray added that Irish scientists are doing \"very innovative work in space\".\n\n\"Our students, our postdocs, people who already have a PhD, are receiving wonderful training from work not only to do with the European Space Agency, but the European Southern Observatory.\n\n\"I've had 30 PhD students and none of them are unemployed. They are immediately snapped up,\" he said.",

    "description": "Tech companies looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly being voted down",
    "fullText": "SPRING CITY, Pa. — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don’t want to live next to them, or even near them.\n\nCommunities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.\n\nIn many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don’t have zoning.\n\nBut as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.\n\n“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania's East Vincent Township. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.”\n\nA growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more.\n\nAndy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he’d worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people’s yards.\n\n“It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.\n\nData Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.\n\nBetween April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.\n\nSome environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they’re fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.\n\n“I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.\n\nIn Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.\n\nFor some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases.\n\nLosing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.\n\nLawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.\n\nBig Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn’t answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.\n\nMicrosoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”\n\nEven with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.\n\nMaxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.\n\n“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”\n\nSome in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.\n\nStill, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.\n\n“It's definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?’” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.\n\nWinning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.\n\nDevelopers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.\n\nThe project would have funded half the city’s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.\n\nHad council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That's for sure.”\n\nIn Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city’s environmental review was adequate.\n\nResidents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.\n\nThey say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.\n\n“It’s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.\n\nDocuments revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn't named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.\"\n\nRebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.\n\nShe found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.\n\n“I don’t think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "title": "Fish Shell Tips and Tricks",
    "description": "A collection of tips and tricks for the fish shell I wish I had known about a long time ago.",
    "fullText": "I recently watched a video by Dreams of Code, which presents nice tips\nand tricks that can be used in the popular zsh shell. Since I use fish instead, I figured it would be a good opportunity to transfer some of those tips over,\nlearn a bit myself, and hopefully help you as well.\n\nThis article will not describe the zsh tips (or only briefly); instead, I invite you to watch the video linked above.\nThey have all been transposed to fish in the sections below (and some more).\n\nSimilar to zsh’s edit-command-buffer widget (which must be bound manually), fish allows one to edit the command\nbuffer in your configured $VISUAL or $EDITOR tool with the default keybinding alt-e.\n\nIn the cast below, the buffer opens in helix, my modal editor of choice!\n\nWhen modifying the command buffer inline with shortcuts such as alt-backspace (deleting a whole\nargument), it’s sometimes convenient to be able to undo the last modification.\n\nfish has a default key assignment for this: ctrl-z. You could have guessed that, right?\n\nThe redo command is bound to ctrl-r by default, but since I use that to open atuin (a really awesome tool, if you don’t know!), I changed the binding:\n\nIn bash, there’s a convenient alias !! to reference the content of the previous command that was run. The same is\navailable in zsh, but there is no equivalent (by default) in fish. However, it’s trivial to implement it with a\ncustom function and associated abbreviation:\n\nIn the video by Dreams of Code, an annoyance mentioned is having to retype a command that was run without sudo but\nrequired it. The proposed solution is to type sudo !! to invoke the last command with sudo.\n\nIn fish, however, there’s a better way! The built-in shortcut alt-s prepends the current\ncommand with sudo, doas, please, or run0, as available. This can even be combined with the previous tip by\ntyping !! followed by alt-s to re-run the last command. Alternatively, bringing up the last\nhistory item with the up arrow before hitting the shortcut also works.\n\nzsh has chpwd(), a hook that runs some code any time the current directory is changed. A very similar thing can be\ndone in fish with the following syntax:\n\nThe function runs any time the special $PWD environment variable changes. In general however, I prefer to rely on direnv for that purpose. That way, the commands to run are defined in a .envrc file which can\nbe different for each directory.\n\nAnother neat trick shown in the video is the ability to enter a filename (without a command before), and zsh applies\nsome replacement template based on the file extension, allowing one to open the file with the desired binary\nautomatically. The feature in question is called “suffix aliases”.\n\nThe best way to go about this is to create a function invoked when the entered command cannot be resolved. That’s what\nthe special fish_command_not_found function does. Here, I chose to view text files with bat and open other files with different editors (those are just examples; in\npractice, you might want to add more extensions and programs).\n\nFirst, the file extension is extracted from the filename, and then a different program is chosen depending on the\nextension. This works because entering a filename (without a command preceding it) doesn’t normally do anything in fish,\nresulting in a “command not found” error. We catch this error and add behavior in case we find that we have passed a\nvalid file.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t find an easy way to have arbitrary path autocompletion in first position (command position).\nSo the full name must be written by hand. Let me know if you find a way to enable completions for files without a\ncommand!\n\nAbbreviations are one of the best features in fish. Unlike\naliases, they expand to show their content, enabling customization of the command, adding parameters and so on.\n\nAliases can be forced to resolve only when they are in command position (first word, which is the default) or anywhere\nin the line as we’ll see below.\n\nThis enables some cool features inspired by the aforementioned video.\n\nSince abbreviations can be usable anywhere in a command with --position anywhere, they can be used to add suffixes to\ncommands to pipe their standard output or errors to /dev/null.\n\nOf course, long commands can be shortened nicely:\n\nIt can also be useful for bookmarks:\n\nHowever, much like Dreams of Code, I prefer to use zoxide to navigate\ndirectories, so much so that I have it aliased to cd.\n\nEven more powerful, it’s possible to indicate where the cursor should be positioned after expansion:\n\nThe % symbol is the default marker for the cursor position (which is used if we don’t specify another marker with --set-cursor=MARKER).\n\nSometimes it’s useful to clear the screen while keeping whatever was already written in the command prompt. The default\nbinding for this is ctrl-l. In zsh, it seems this requires some widget scripting.\n\nThere are many options to copy and paste parts of the command buffer to the system clipboard or fish’s pasteboard,\nwhich is ominously called the Kill Ring.\n\nThe one I use the most is copying the whole content of the buffer into the system clipboard, which is easy enough with\nthe ctrl-x shortcut. To paste, a simple ctrl-v does the trick.\n\nAs a bonus, I just found out about the directory history, which enables navigation to previously visited folders with\nthe alt-left shortcut (when the command line is empty). Similarly, one can go forward in the\nhistory with alt-right. A game-changer when switching between two projects frequently!\n\nI hope you found something useful in this article. Thanks to Dreams of Code for\ninspiring this article. Until next time!",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. Home loan rates may seem very familiar because they haven't changed much for weeks. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nNational average mortgage rates basically unchanged from last weekend. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%. It has been an extended period of very calm mortgage rates.\n\nMORE: See the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.01%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.01% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,800, and you’d pay $348,209 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.44% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,442. But you’d only pay $139,508 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 6.01%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01% right now, according to Zillow.

    "fullText": "The combined efforts between government officials and the public have helped significantly reduce the population of an invasive species in a Florida county.\n\nAccording to Observer Local News, the number of wild hogs caught in Flagler County has dropped by one-third in just the past year. There has been a management and removal program in place for the past few years from the Land Management department, but the addition of a reporting dashboard for residents to alert officials to wild hog sightings has added to their efforts.\n\nIn 2023, before the reporting program was in place, 255 hogs were captured. After the program began in 2024, that number went up to 604, and this year it stands at 412.\n\n\"One of the positive things that we can see is — you want that number to start going down. And it is actually starting to go down because of the excellent results that we're getting,\" Land Management Director Erik Revuelta told Observer Local News.\n\nThe animals are known to cause thousands of dollars in damage to property, and Revuelta said that the hogs are being pushed more and more onto private property thanks to habitat destruction from human development.\n\nWild hogs are not native to Florida, but according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have been in the state for hundreds of years, possibly introduced by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto around 1539.\n\nDespite their long tenure in the state, they are still a threat to native plants and wildlife, outcompeting them for resources and consuming them unchecked in some cases. The University of Florida reports that economic damage from wild hogs is actually in the billions for the state, as these animals feed on crops, destroy terrain, affect livestock, and are capable of transmitting serious diseases to animals and humans alike.\n\nThe efforts to remove the invasive pigs are an excellent reminder of the need to support native species in your area. You can take steps in your own backyard by planting native plants, which encourage local animals to utilize them for food and habitat, and are easier and cheaper to maintain than many other invasive species.\n\nDo you think humans are doing enough to protect endangered animals?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The OLED evo W6 from LG makes a glorious return with an even more minimalist design.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly 10 years since LG first introduced its Wallpaper TV that was so thin that the mounting process felt like applying wallpaper. After eventually discontinuing the ultra-thin TVs in 2020, LG is finally reviving the Wallpaper TV series with the OLED evo W6 that will make its debut at CES 2026. LG is marketing the updated Wallpaper TV as the \"world's thinnest\" OLED that's truly wireless, making some major upgrades to the original.\n\nInstead of the companion soundbar that housed all the ports, LG designed the Zero Connect Box that hosts all the inputs and can transmit from up to roughly 32 feet away. It's similar to what Samsung has been doing with its Wireless One Connect Box, which is often paired with its Frame TV lineup. While you won't have to worry about a web of tangled wires or a clunky soundbar, the OLED evo W6 measures slightly thicker at 9mm, compared to its predecessor's hyperthin 2.6mm measurement. That's more than three times the thickness, but it's still impressive if you consider that the W6 will feel about as thick as putting an iPhone 17 Pro Max against your wall.\n\nThe latest Wallpaper TV does come with plenty of improvements, though, including LG's third-gen α 11 Processor. LG also added its new Hyper Radiant Color Technology to the W6, which translates to deeper blacks, improved colors and higher brightness levels. There's even a Brightness Booster Ultra feature that LG claims results in four times the brightness of conventional OLED. To complement the extra nits, LG specifically designed a screen that reduces reflections for the Wallpaper TV.\n\nThe updated W6 can handle gaming better, too, since it supports a 4K 165Hz refresh rate and has a 0.1 pixel response time that's crucial for competitive gaming. LG added compatibility with NVIDIA's G-Sync, AMD's FreeSync Premium, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot. When you're not using the Wallpaper TV, LG has its Gallery+ feature that can display screensaver visuals, personal photos or images created with generative AI.\n\nLG didn't reveal what sizes the upgraded Wallpaper TV would be available in, but it will be on display later this week at CES 2026. LG hasn't offered any clues about pricing yet either, but we wouldn't be surprised to see an equally shocking price as compared to the last Wallpaper TV, which cost up to $20,000.",

    "fullText": "ALTADENA, Calif. (AP) — “DANGER: Lead Work Area” reads a sign on a front door of an Altadena home. “May damage fertility or the unborn child. Causes damage to the central nervous system.”\n\nBlock after block there are reminders that contaminants still linger.\n\nHouse cleaners, hazardous waste workers and homeowners alike come and go wearing masks, respirators, gloves and hazmat suits as they wipe, vacuum and power-wash homes that weren’t burnt to ash.\n\nIt’s been a year of heartbreak and worry since the most destructive wildfires in the Los Angeles area's history scorched neighborhoods and displaced tens of thousands of people. Two wind-whipped blazes that ignited on Jan. 7, 2025, killed at least 31 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures, including homes, schools, businesses and places of worship. Rebuilding will take years.\n\nThe disaster has brought another wave of trauma for people afraid of what still lurks inside their homes.\n\nIndoor air quality after wildfires remains understudied, and scientists still don’t know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fires like last year’s in Los Angeles. But some chemicals released are known to be linked to heart disease and lung issues, and exposure to minerals like magnetite has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nAsh in the area is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It can contain pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead or other heavy metals.\n\nMany with homes still standing are now living with the hazards left by the fires.\n\nPeople forced back into their Altadena homes\n\nNina and Billy Malone considered their home of 20 years a safe haven before smoke, ash and soot seeped inside, leaving behind harmful levels of lead even after professional cleaning. Recent testing found the toxin is still on the wooden floors of their living room and bedroom.\n\nThey were forced to move back home in August anyway, after insurance cut off their rental assistance.\n\nSince then, Nina wakes up almost daily with a sore throat and headaches. Billy had to get an inhaler for his worsening wheezing and congestion. And their bedroom, Nina said, smells “like an ashtray has been sitting around for a long time.\" She worries most about exposure to unregulated contaminants that insurance companies aren't required to test.\n\n\"I don’t feel comfortable in the space,” said Nina, whose neighbors' homes burned down across the street.\n\nData shows dangerous lead levels still in homes\n\nAccording to a report released in November by the Eaton Fire Residents United, a volunteer group formed by residents, six out of 10 homes damaged from smoke from the Eaton Fire still have dangerous levels of cancer-causing asbestos, brain-damaging lead or both. That’s based on self-submitted data from 50 homeowners who have cleaned their homes, with 78% hiring professional cleaners.\n\nOf the 50 homes, 63% have lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency’s standard, according to the report. The average lead levels were almost 60 times higher than the EPA's rule.\n\nEven after fires were extinguished, volatile organic compounds from smoke, some known to cause cancer, lingered inside of people's homes, according to a recent study. To mitigate these risks, residents returning home should ventilate and filter indoor air by opening windows or running high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers with charcoal filters.\n\nZoe Gonzalez Izquierdo said she can’t get her insurance company to pay for an adequate cleanup of her family's Altadena home, which tested positive for dangerous levels of lead and other toxic compounds.\n\n“They can’t just send a company that’s not certified to just wipe things down so that then we can go back to a still contaminated home,” Gonzalez said, who has children ages 2 and 4.\n\nExperts believe the lead, which can linger in dust on floors and windowsills, comes from burned lead paint. The University of Southern California reported that more than 70% of homes within the Eaton Fire were built before 1979, when lead paint was common.\n\n“For individuals that are pregnant, for young children, it’s particularly important that we do everything we can to eliminate exposure to lead,” said pediatrician Dr. Lisa Patel, executive director for the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and a member of the climate group Science Moms.\n\nThe same goes for asbestos, she added, because there is no safe level of exposure.\n\nPeople who lived in the Pacific Palisades, which was also scorched, face similar challenges.\n\nResidents are at the mercy of their insurance companies, who decide on what they cover and how much. It’s a grueling, constant battle for many. The state’s insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over its handling of fire damage claims.\n\nHomeowners want state agencies to enforce a requirement that insurance companies return a property to pre-fire condition.\n\nJulie Lawson won't take any risks. Her family paid about $7,000 out of pocket to test the soil in their Altadena home, even though their insurance company had already agreed to pay to replace the grass in their front yard. They planned to test for contaminants again once they finished remediating the inside, the process of making a home contaminant-free after a fire. If insurance won't cover it, they'll pay for it themselves.\n\nEven if their home is livable again, they still face other losses — including equity and the community they once had.\n\n“We have to live in the scar,\" she said. “We're all still really struggling.\"\n\nThey will be living in a construction zone for years. “This isn't over for us.”\n\nChallenges and mental health toll\n\nAnnie Barbour with the nonprofit United Policyholders has been helping people navigate the challenges, which include insurance companies resisting to pay for contamination testing and industrial hygienists disagreeing on what to test for.\n\nShe sees the mental health toll it's having on people — and as a survivor herself of the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Northern California, she understands it.\n\nMany were at first joyful to see their houses still standing.\n\n“But they’ve been in their own special kind of hell ever since,” Barbour said.\n\nNow residents like the Malones are inspecting their belongings, one by one, fearing they may have absorbed toxins.\n\nBoxes, bags and bins stuffed with clothes, chinaware and everything in between fill the couple's car, basement, garage and home.\n\nThey have been painstakingly going through their things, assessing what they think can be adequately cleaned. In the process, Nina is cleaning cabinets, drawers, floors and still finding soot and ash. She wears gloves and a respirator, or sometimes just an N-95 mask.\n\nTheir insurance won't pay to retest their home, Billy said, so they're considering paying the $10,000 themselves. And if results show there's still contamination, their insurance company told them they will only pay to clean up toxins that are federally regulated, like lead and asbestos.\n\n“I don't know how you fight that,” said Nina, who is considering therapy to cope with her anxiety. “How do you find that argument to compel an insurance company to pay for something to make yourself safe?”\n\nAP staff writer Alex Veiga contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

    "description": "Archaeologists confirm a mile-long tunnel network under Cusco’s Temple of the Sun, revealing Incan engineering and links to key sites like Sacsahuaman.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe existence of a tunnel network under the ancient Peruvian city of Cusco had been rumored for centuries.\n\nAt times stretching more than a mile, the labyrinth connected the Temple of the Sun to key points, such as a fortress.\n\nIncan builders made use of what’s known as the cut-and-cover method of crafting tunnels.\n\nThe Incan Temple of the Sun in Cusco has long been a visual and cultural jewel of the ancient empire. But there’s even more to admire below ground. Recently, archaeologists confirmed a long-held rumor: the existence of a labyrinth of underground tunnels extending out from the temple, sometimes over a mile in length.\n\nFirst hinted at in historical texts that date as far back as the 16th century, researchers have wondered if this labyrinth—known as a chincana—was real. Turns out, it is.\n\nArchaeologist Jorge Calero Flores announced the findings at a press conference, and said the research team found a main branch connecting the temple to the fortress of Sacsahuaman, just over one mile away. The system is made up of three smaller branches—one near the Church of San Cristóbal, another to an area near the fortress, and a third to an area known as Callispuquio.\n\nThe Peru Archaeologists Association said that the tunnels were created by the Inca people. They first dug trenches, and then supported them with stone walls and carved-beam ceilings. Calero Flores said that the tunnel system is roughly 8.5 feet wide and 5.2 feet high. “We suspect that the Inca could have been carried in litters through there,” he said, according to the Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe path to finding the ancient labyrinth started with Jesuit texts from the 16th century. An anonymous Spanish Jesuit individual wrote about a tunnel in 1594 that connected the bishop’s housing to the Cusco Cathedral, alluding to the fact the tunnel originated at the Temple of the Sun. A later document from chronicler Anello de Oliva also discussed multiple underground passages in the city. The texts noted that, during construction in the area, workers ensured they did not disturb the tunnel network—one that started at a cave in the fortress. That was enough, Flores said, to give archaeologists “an idea” of where to look.\n\nBefore probing the ground, the team used acoustic prospecting to find hollow areas. That data gave them a better understanding of where to use ground-penetrating radar to create a more specific map of the chincana.\n\nArchaeologist Mildred Fernandez Palomino said that the next step in learning more about the tunnels is getting inside them. “Now we have to excavate at key points to be able to enter the chincana,” she said, according to IFL Science.\n\nResearchers believe that the tunnel system was an underground representation of the above-ground street network of the ancient Incan city of Cusco. Located about 130 miles from Machu Picchu, Cusco was once a thriving hub for the Inca Empire. Now, it’s a popular tourist spot and an archaeological marvel.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Marco Rubio was visibly irritated to be reminded that despite the capture of former president Nicolás Maduro, the dictator’s regime is still in power in Venezuela.\n\n“I’m curious why the Trump administration decided to leave [Maduro’s regime] intact and only arrest Nicolás Maduro and his wife,” host Margaret Brennan questioned on Face the Nation Sunday, pointing out others in Maduro’s government who were indicted in the U.S.\n\n“I’m confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn’t you arrest them if you are taking out the narcoterrorist regime?” she asked.\n\n“You’re confused? I don’t know why that is confusing to you,” Rubio responded, with Brennan repeating: “They are still in power.”\n\nThe secretary of state lashed out at the CBS News host, saying that there was already enough “complaining” about the capture of just one Venezuelan politician—and that the military operation was difficult enough as it was.\n\n“You’re going to go in and suck up five people? They are already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people,” Rubio said.\n\n“We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife who is also indicted. That was a sophisticated, and frankly complicated operation.”\n\nAs Brennan agreed with the complexity of the raid, Rubio continued: “It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets.\n\n“That’s not an easy mission. You’re asking me why didn’t we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that’s absurd.”\n\nRubio persisted in fawning over the operation, adding: “I do think it’s one of the most, you know, daring, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time. Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it. It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success.\n\n“And today, an indicted drug trafficker—who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela, who we do not recognize, the Biden administration didn’t recognize, sixty-something countries don’t recognize, the European Union doesn’t recognize, and many countries in Latin America don’t recognize—he was an indicted drug trafficker. He was arrested, his wife was arrested—\"\n\nBrennan interjected and once again asked about the co-conspirators left behind. “Right, but the others who were also indicted are still in place, so that is the point of my questioning there. You talked about not being the legitimate president—\"\n\nRubio interrupted in turn, accusing: “So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?”\n\n“No, I’m asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation. To your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president,” Brennan responded.\n\n“He was claiming to be the president,” said Rubio, speaking over Brennan again to specify: “He was the top target.”",

    "fullText": "Snow droughts in Utah could impact how much water is available in 2026.\n\nUtah tends to get an average of 275 inches of snow a year, but this winter has seen a 25-year low of snowfall, according to Kuer.\n\nIt's not just skiers who are impacted by the warmer weather — it could have a serious impact on water supplies.\n\nLake Powell and Lake Mead, the country's two largest reservoirs, rely on melted snowpack to provide water to tens of millions of Americans.\n\nAccording to the Colorado River Research Group, even a near-average snowpack over the colder months could mean that these reservoir water levels could drop to a record-low in 2026.\n\nJack Schmidt, the co-author of the report and the director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University, commented to Kuer on the record-low water levels, \"We would be in unprecedented territory.\"\n\nAlong with low snowfall so far, dry soils near Lake Powell will likely soak up a lot of water before it reaches the water system. Schmidt added that not all of the water in the reservoirs will be usable, and said, \"We're closer to the edge of the cliff than we realize.\"\n\nThree-quarters of the water usage in Utah goes towards agriculture, so low levels and potential droughts could have a severe impact on food systems, farmers' income, and the economy as a whole.\n\nAs well as that, droughts can leave people without water in their homes and can result in wildfires and other extreme weather events.\n\nThis snow drought is another piece of a worrying pattern that could have severe impacts on the health of people and the planet. Although extreme weather events have been around forever, human-induced harm to the planet supercharges them.\n\nHow worried are you about rising ocean levels?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe report called for a reduction in water consumption so that the lack of resources can be spread further.\n\nOn a governmental level, there are some options that could help temporarily prop up the reservoirs, but they would be risky and only act as a short-term fix. For example, water could be released from the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in northeast Utah to fill up Lake Powell. Another option would be to reduce the amount of water being let off to go to California, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nUltimately, the rising temperatures and carbon pollution need to be tackled to prevent further droughts.\n\nIn your personal life, you could consider installing solar panels, switching to an electric vehicle, or upgrading your lawn to a less water-intensive native lawn.\n\nTo protect your house from potential droughts, you could consider collecting rainwater for a free supply of water.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

Rumors of the deaths circulated on the island over the weekend.\n\n“You know, a lot of Cubans were killed yesterday,” U.S. President Donald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One as he flew Sunday night from Florida back to Washington. “There was a lot of death on the other side. No death on our side.”\n\nThe U.S. operation Saturday seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife to face prosecution on an indictment accusing them of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy.\n\nWhile Venezuela's government has acknowledged that a number of people died in the American blasts, they did not confirm how many were killed to The Associated Press.\n\nCuba’s government announced two days of mourning for the Cuban officers who were killed, and former president and revolutionary leader Raúl Castro and President Miguel Díaz-Canel sent condolences to their families. The names of the dead and the positions they held were not immediately disclosed by Cuban authorities.\n\n“Faithful to their responsibilities for security and defense, our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism and fell after fierce resistance in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of the bombings of the facilities,” the official statement said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, also pointed to Cuban involvement in Venezuela over the weekend, saying that Maduro's internal security apparatus was headed by Cubans and that they were “propping up Maduro.”\n\n“All the guards that help protect Maduro — this is well known — their whole spy agency, all that were full of Cubans,” Rubio said.",

Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "description": "Ethan Tan joined his dad in the hawker business and learned how to maintain a father-son relationship outside work — after many fights.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ethan Tan, a 24-year-old prawn noodle hawker from Singapore. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always loved cooking with my mother and watching cooking videos. It took me three painful years studying computer engineering and one corporate internship to decide hawker life was the way to go.\n\nMy parents wanted me to learn something traditional and study engineering or become a doctor.\n\nSo I thought, \"I like playing computer games, so let's pursue computer engineering.\" I didn't think much about it, and I didn't do much research.\n\nWhen the course started, I hated it. I didn't get coding at all. Examinations were hard for me, and I just suffered through them.\n\nThe point where I really felt like this wasn't the right path for me was when I got caught cheating during an exam. I managed to lie to the examiner and pretend I wasn't cheating.\n\nBut that made me realize something: If I have to resort to cheating, this is really not what I want to do.\n\nI did an internship at Accenture. It was the same thing every day: sitting at the same table from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., queuing for lunch at a crowded food court, and taking the train home.\n\nThe only comfort was sleeping in the office chair. I slept there every day for two hours. It was very boring.\n\nWith a corporate job out of the question, I looked for other career paths.\n\nAfter graduating and completing my military service, I joined my father at his seafood hawker stall.\n\nAfter about three years of managing the stall, and a short stint at the kitchens in The American Club in Singapore for some restaurant experience, I told my dad I wanted to build something of my own.\n\nIn August 2024, I opened Udang Udang, a halal prawn noodle stall right beside my father's stall in Singapore's northern Woodlands neighborhood. I used my grandmother's recipes and a recipe I learned from a streetside vendor I met in Penang, Malaysia.\n\nBefore I hired staff, it was rough. I got in early in the mornings to fry up 40 kilograms of prawn heads to make the broth. It needs to boil for six hours, and in Singapore's heat, that's no joke.\n\nBut now, more than a year on, business is faring well. I sell an average of 600 bowls of noodles daily, earning about 3,000 Singapore dollars, or about $2,300, in sales every day. I manage both my dad's stall and my own.\n\nMy plan is now to expand to more outlets around Singapore, with one new store every year.\n\nIt was tough working with my dad at the start. We fought almost every day for the first two years, and many tables were slammed in frustration.\n\nWe don't see eye to eye on many things. I tried to convince him to spend more money on marketing, including hiring influencers to try our food and creating promotional videos, but he prefers for the word to spread organically. We feel differently about how we price our products as well.\n\nIt's been challenging to learn how to work together. But we've nailed it down now, learning how to separate life and work, and talking through our differences.\n\nAt work, we're not father and son. We can fight and argue all we want. But when we get back home, I'm still his beloved son.",

    "fullText": "Denmark and Greenland are once again calling on the US to stop eyeing Greenland as land for sale.\n\nIn a statement on a Danish government website on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, \"I have to say this very directly to the United States.\"\n\n\"It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland,\" she said. \"The United States has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Commonwealth.\"\n\nFrederiksen, who has been the country's prime minister since 2019, said that Greenland, which falls under the Kingdom of Denmark, is part of NATO, \"and is therefore covered by the alliance's security guarantee.\"\n\nShe added that Denmark has a defense agreement with the US, which gives the US access to Greenland. The US has one military base, the Pituffik Space Base, in Greenland.\n\n\"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale,\" Frederiksen said in her statement.\n\nThe Danish prime minister's statement comes after President Donald Trump's former aide, Katie Miller, posted an image on X of a map of Greenland superimposed with the US flag.\n\nThe Sunday post by Miller, who is married to White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, was accompanied by the caption, \"SOON.\"\n\nAnd over recent years, Trump has repeatedly talked about the possibility of buying Greenland for US security and to tap into its trove of natural resources.\n\nJesper Møller Sørensen, the Danish ambassador to the US, responded to Miller's post, writing, \"Just a friendly reminder about the US and the Kingdom of Denmark: We are close allies and should continue to work together as such.\"\n\nSørensen added that he expects \"full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"\n\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Sunday Facebook post, \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nHe said he would not accept \"fantasies of annexation,\" and said that he found the US's messaging \"completely and utterly unacceptable.\"\n\nTrump first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in August 2019, per a report that month by The Wall Street Journal. Greenland's foreign affairs ministry wrote in an X post in the same month, \"We're open for business, not for sale.\"\n\nIn a congressional address in March, shortly after commencing his second term, Trump said the US would take control of Greenland, \"One way or the other.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance also visited Greenland in March.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump and Frederiksen did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Patria, Finland's biggest defense contractor, is scaling up production as it deals with an order backlog of over 1,000 vehicles from NATO allies.",
    "fullText": "Alarms blare over the factory floors, and work at Patria's Hämeenlinna facility grinds to a halt.\n\nThe soft thrum of an explosion echoes through the campus. Moments later, roughly 700 workers continue making their armored vehicles bound for Japan, Sweden, Slovakia, and other countries. The blast is not a test-firing of its new combat vehicle, but part of the construction for its expanding manufacturing facility.\n\nPatria, Finland's largest defense company, is planning to nearly double production at its main hub just north of Helsinki, clearing rocks with explosives on-site to make way for several new assembly lines.\n\nThe Hämeenlinna factory manufactures Patria's 8×8 armored personnel carrier and a relatively new, up-and-coming vehicle: a wheeled 6×6 troop transport that's receiving surging demand from northern and western Europe.\n\nWork on the 25-foot-long, 17-ton vehicle began in 2020 under a joint program between Finland and Latvia called the Common Armored Vehicles System. Both countries sought a cost-effective, mass-produced armored vehicle that could be used by their militaries for interoperability.\n\nLatvia has since sent at least 42 of these vehicles to Ukraine, armed with heavy machine guns and rolled out in batches over the last year. The vehicle can cross tundra and even rivers while shielding up to 10 troops it carries from land mines and artillery fire to get them to forward positions.\n\nWhen Business Insider visited Patria's factory, representatives for the company — which is majority-owned by the state of Finland — said the firm wasn't authorized to share details about the 6×6's performance in Ukraine.\n\nBut the CAVS 6×6 program has been quickly drawing attention from the rest of Europe: What began as a partnership between two countries has expanded into a consortium of seven member states.\n\nSweden joined the Common Armored Vehicles System program in 2022, followed by Germany, Denmark, the UK, and Norway in subsequent years.\n\nFinland and Latvia have placed orders for just under 500 of these vehicles, while Sweden has requested 415 of the 6×6s to be delivered over the next five years. Stockholm's latest order for 94 vehicles, announced in early December, priced each one at about $1.75 million.\n\nGermany has become the program's largest buyer, signing contracts in mid-December to acquire 876 of the 6×6 vehicles, valued at $2.3 billion. These vehicles will be split into four variants, including one that features a mortar turret.\n\nMeanwhile, Denmark, which joined the program this year, has already placed an order for 129 6×6 vehicles.\n\nThe UK and Norway are still negotiating 6×6 orders with Patria.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 can accommodate roughly 10 troops, along with a typical crew of two or three, and features up to NATO standard level 4 armor designed to withstand direct hits from large-caliber machine gun fire, mine explosions, and nearby artillery blasts.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 competes with other wheeled troop transports, such as Rheinmetall's Boxer and General Dynamics Land Systems' Stryker, the latter of which is extensively fielded by the US Army.\n\nThe Finnish company said it can tweak the vehicle for each customer's needs, but a typical model features climate control that enables the vehicle to operate in temperatures as low as -40°F.\n\n\"Inside, it will be comfortable enough to easily survive. We are talking about temperatures of the plus centigrades,\" Mikko Rantanen, Patria's director for 6×6 vehicle programs, told Business Insider from inside the rear compartment of one of the vehicles.\n\nThe 6×6's rear interior is spartan: Cloth-covered metal-frame seats and headrests for five people on either side, with space behind each seat for equipment and small arms.\n\nThere's just enough room for a soldier to sit with their knees touching the opposite passenger's. A few fire extinguishers inside are connected to an automatic suppression system that can detect a blaze in the rear cabin.\n\nScreens allow troops to see outside the vehicle through exterior cameras, while a rear hatch provides the option of fitting a machine gun or crewed weapon module on top of the 6×6.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the vehicle, a small passageway also lets troops pass between the rear compartment and the driver's cabin, which resembles that of a truck and features an automatic gearbox.\n\nOptional propellers on the 6×6's underside enable it to transition seamlessly from traversing land to crossing small bodies of water, such as rivers or lakes.\n\n\"We can enter the water without needing preparation in this configuration,\" said Rantanen.\n\nHowever, the 6×6's speed in the water is just under 5 mph, and Rantanen added that it's not meant to be a landing craft or amphibious assault vehicle.\n\nOn land, it's designed to drive at speeds of over 60 mph, easily cross trenches that are four feet wide, and surmount obstacles about two feet high.\n\nBuilding weapons and vehicles specifically for arctic terrain is a specialty for contractors in Finland, a country renowned for holding off the Soviet Union for over 100 days in deep snow and dense forest during World War II.\n\nPatria said that while the 6×6 can be outfitted for various terrain types, including the desert, the arctic domain is its forte.\n\nSnow isn't the only challenge in arctic warfare. Few roads are available on Finland's border with Russia — the priority threat for NATO — and its vast hinterland is peppered with thousands of small lakes and marshland that can bog down armored transport.\n\n\"In the wintertime, it's snow,\" said Petri Hepola, Patria's executive vice president for sales and marketing and its chief program officer for the F-35. \"In the summer, lots of wet soil and swampy areas. One of the most important features is how fast you can move your troops and tools through these areas.\"\n\nFinland and Norway are the only two members of Patria's 6×6 program that share Arctic borders with Russia.\n\nHowever, as northern Europe, especially the Baltic and Nordic states, grows increasingly concerned about conflict with Moscow, the Kremlin has been bolstering its military presence in the high north, repopulating key bases and transforming its Arctic fleet into a separate strategic theater.\n\nSince Finland joined NATO in 2023, alliance forces have been rushing to train on the country's terrain and frigid temperatures, making it one of the most active spots for joint exercises in recent years.\n\n\"Our products have been surviving very well in that environment,\" Hepola said.\n\nWith an order backlog of nearly 2,000 6×6 vehicles, Patria hopes its new facility in Hämeenlinna will be ready for production by 2027. The factory campus serves only the tail end of the entire manufacturing cycle, which can take weeks in most cases, or several months for more complicated variants.\n\nInside, hundreds of workers conduct welding, surface treatment, assembly, tests, and other final processes that can each take weeks to complete. Dozens of vehicles line the factory floors, and dozens more sit in parking lots, each marked with a flag to designate the country for which it has been modified.\n\nBefore delivery, each one is supposed to be driven at least 200 km, or 124 miles.\n\nRantanen, director of the 6×6 program, said Patria has been integrating counter-drone systems, such as jammers, on the vehicle.\n\nArmored vehicles in Ukraine have especially struggled against pervasive minefields and small drones with explosive payloads, some of which are controlled via a fiber optic cable connection that can't be jammed. In response, soldiers there have relied more on firearms such as shotguns and machine guns to counter such attacks.\n\nRantanen said Patria hasn't yet officially added any kinetic weapons that can take down drones.\n\n\"The drone threat is currently evolving at such a speed that it's hard to keep track of it closely,\" he said. \"But we are hard at work for the countermeasures against drones as well.\"",

    "description": "\"And I looked at the fierce, insanely gorgeous blue eyes and thought, 'I see what she means,'\" Mary Steenburgen said.",
    "fullText": "Mary Steenburgen, 72, says her perspective on aging changed after a conversation with Jane Fonda, 88.\n\nSpeaking to People in an interview published on Friday, Steenburgen said she hadn't expected one of their early interactions to have such a lasting impact.\n\n\"When we became friends, I remember her almost walking out the front gate and then turning around, looking at me and saying, 'Are we going to be friends?' And I said, 'Yes.' And she said, 'Now don't just say it by rote. Are you going to be intentional? We've got to be. Because at my age, I have to be intentional,\" Steenburgen said, recalling Fonda's words.\n\n\"And I looked at the fierce, insanely gorgeous blue eyes and thought, 'I see what she means.' I see the intention behind them because there's a clock, and you don't know how long you have. But as you get older, it's shorter,\" she said.\n\nSteenburgen and Fonda were costars in the 2018 film \"Book Club,\" and its 2023 sequel, \"Book Club: The Next Chapter.\"\n\nThat lesson has stayed with Steenburgen and now shapes how she spends time with the people closest to her.\n\n\"With not wasting time on people that aren't in my life for the right reason, for being honest with myself about life. All that stuff, aging, it actually makes it more interesting,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nThe actor said Fonda also encourages her to stay curious and not slow down.\n\n\"And then the other thing that she inspired was, she always said, 'Don't take your foot off the gas pedal. Push it down harder. Harder now.' So we're inspired by that,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Steenburgen has spoken about the lessons she learned about aging. In a 2013 interview with Allure, shortly after she turned 60, Steenburgen said she was excited about growing older.\n\n\"I decided if you're lucky enough to be alive, you should use each birthday to celebrate what your life is about,\" she said.\n\nFonda has also consistently spoken about choosing to age thoughtfully and with intention.\n\nIn November, Fonda said turning 60 made her rethink how she wanted to spend her time.\n\n\"This is the beginning of my final act. And I didn't know how to live it. So I thought, well, what am I most afraid of?\" Fonda said. \"I'm afraid of dying with a lot of regrets. I watched my dad die with a lot of regrets. That was an important realization for me, because if you don't want to die with regrets, then you have to live the last part of your life in such a way that there won't be any regrets.\"",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk joined Donald Trump for dinner during a packed weekend for the president, who was hosting meetings at Mar-a-Lago as his administration announced a US military operation in Venezuela.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that the US had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, a move that drew swift international reaction.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, Musk wrote that he had \"a lovely dinner\" with Trump and first lady Melania Trump, adding: \"2026 is going to be amazing!\"\n\nThe photo posted on X shows the three of them seated at a dinner table, chatting. The dinner took place on Saturday evening at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, according to Fox News.\n\nHad a lovely dinner last night with @POTUS and @FLOTUS.\n\n2026 is going to be amazing! pic.twitter.com/1Oq35b1PEC\n\nThe dinner comes after a very public cooling of relations between Trump and Musk last year.\n\nIn November, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO attended a White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — his first public appearance at the White House since falling out with Trump in June. The guest list included several top executives.\n\nAfter the dinner, Musk shared photos on X showing himself with the crown prince, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Trump. \"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nIn September, the two were spotted shaking hands at a memorial service for political activist Charlie Kirk, marking their first public interaction since their alliance collapsed.\n\nThe relationship between the two publicly unraveled in June, shortly after Musk stepped away from his role as the de facto head of the White House's DOGE Office.\n\nBefore the fallout, Musk was one of Trump's most visible and influential allies. He described himself as Trump's \"first buddy\" after the president's election win.\n\nMusk later played a central role in the administration's effort to cut government spending before leaving the post in May.\n\nTensions escalated after Musk criticized Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" prompting a public back-and-forth between the two men. Musk said Trump owed his presidential election win to him, while Trump threatened to pull government contracts held by Musk's companies.\n\nIn July, Musk said he would launch a new political party called the \"America Party.\"\n\n\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,\" Musk wrote in an X post. Trump fired back on his Truth Social platform, saying Musk had gone \"completely off the rails.\"",

    "description": "The oil market was already under pressure before the latest development, with crude futures falling 20% last year.",
    "fullText": "Oil futures fluctuated between gains and losses in the first trading day since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell as much as 1.4% in the opening hour of trading before moving sideways. They were 0.5% lower at $57.01 at midnight on Monday.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were 0.4% lower at $60.50 a barrel after falling as much as 1.4% in early trade.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude. It's been a focus of OPEC+, which also over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the global total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, reflecting years of aging infrastructure and the impact of sanctions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil production does pick up, analysts say it could take time and big money.\n\n\"It will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country,\" wrote Peter McNally, the global head of sector analysts at research firm Third Bridge, on Sunday.\n\nMcNally added that there are no swift solutions for Venezuela, where years of underinvestment have eroded infrastructure across the economy, and a severe power crisis continues to disrupt daily life.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs echoed that view in a Sunday note, writing that \"higher recovery rates of heavy Venezuela oil will likely require financial and time investments in oil-processing upgraders and improvements in operational efficiencies, power availability, and oil transporting infrastructure.\"\n\nVenezuela produced around 3 million barrels a day of oil at its peak in the mid-2000s.\n\nEven before the US captured Maduro, Venezuela's oil exports had already come under pressure after Trump imposed a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters last month. The blockade remains in place.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the latest developments increase the likelihood of a shift toward a policy environment more supportive of oil investment, even as short-term changes to oil flows — including both modest increases and further disruptions — remain possible.\n\nThe developments are negative for oil prices over the long run, as any sustained increase in Venezuelan output would add to already ample supply at a time of slowing demand growth, according to Goldman.\n\n\"Production may edge up slightly in the short-run, including in a scenario with a US-supported government and full sanctions relief. Alternatively, disruptions to Venezuela oil deliveries could continue and/or intensify in the short-run, for instance because Maduro's cabinet has asserted its control,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman estimates WTI and Brent to average $51 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively, should Venezuelan crude production fall by 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2026.\n\nShould the country's crude production rise by 400,000 barrels a day instead, WTI and Brent are expected to average $50 a barrel and $54 a barrel, respectively, in 2026, the analysts added.",

    "title": "My Five Favorite Things I Saw at CES Unveiled 2026",
    "description": "I saw robotic dogs, 3D screen protectors for your iPhone, and rapid food allergen testers.",
    "fullText": "While CES doesn't technically kick off until Tuesday, the conference gets a bit of a soft launch with CES Unveiled. This event hosts a ton of companies, all proudly showing off their latest products and concepts in one giant room. While there's plenty to write home about, five products in particular this year caught my eye:\n\nTombot's robotic puppy, \"Jennie,\" isn't supposed to be a pet-replacement. Instead, Jennie is specifically designed to help people with Alzheimer's. The bot is a healthcare device, and is made to not only comfort owners, but to monitor \"sundowning,\" or the confusion that some living with Alzheimer experience in late afternoon and at night.\n\nI can't speak to the medical claims, but Tombot impressed me. I've seen products like this before, but what struck me was the realism. That's not to say Tombot's robot tricks you into thinking there's a real puppy on the table. But the company has designed the bot with enough motors and sensors to make it realistic enough. When you look at Jennie, she looks at you; when you move, her face reacts in kind, powered by cleverly-placed motors. There are capacitive touch sensors to react to touch, light sensors to adjust to the lighting of the room, gyros for orientation, and microphones to responds to sounds.\n\nJennie is designed to be interactive: You can call its name—either Jennie, or a name you set in the app—and it responds to the call, potentially with a bark. Tombot says that it hired a number of ten-week-old lab puppies to record the voices for its bot. In all, Jennie will have about 1,500 unique behaviors when Tombot launches her this year.\n\nTombot told me that Jennie is designed to last all day on a single charge. When you aren't home, Jennie can drop into a sort of low power mode, that should last over a week. When you come back, Jennie should immediately welcome you home. Tombot says its bot will cost $1,500 at launch, but will offer financing options.\n\nWhat if you could turn your iPhone into a 3DS? That's what I took away from the premise of CubicSpace's CubicScreen, anyway. The company makes a screen protector for your iPhone embedded with an optical filter that allows you to view spatial photos and videos in 3D, without the need for glasses or a separate device. It's your 2D iPhone, in 3D.\n\nI was a bit skeptical walking past the booth, but, in practice, the tech really works. CubicSpace had some 3D photos and videos already stored in the CubicScreen app on their demo iPhones, and, when looking at the screen, they really did appear three dimensional. This isn't \"pop out of your screen\" 3D, mind you; rather, it's an depth effect. If you've ever used the 3D feature on a 3DS, this is that experience: You'll be able to see the depth behind subjects in your photos and videos, which adds to the immersion of the image.\n\nPart of the effect uses eye tracking to adjust the effect as you view the image. To that point, the app can support zooming while retaining the 3D effect. It's a little trippy: You zoom in on an picture, and, most of the time, it snaps into 3D instantly. Sometimes, the effect falls out, and you can tell you're looking at a distorted image. But most of my experience, the effect held.\n\nThis 3D effect wasn't just a trick of editing, either: CubicSpace took a photo of Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor, Michelle Ehrhardt at the booth, which instantly took on the 3D effect. The screen overlay and the software appears to work fast.\n\nCubicScreen will cost $79 when it launches. There is currently an order page, but they aren't accepting payment yet.\n\nIf you have a food allergy, you know the stress that comes when you're not in control of your meals. There's a risk to eating food you didn't make yourself, and for some of us, that risk isn't an option.\n\nThat's why I found Allergen Alert's \"the mini lab\" so intriguing. The idea is, when you want to know whether your food contains a certain allergen, you can scoop a sample of it into the provided container, place that container into the mini lab, and within two minutes, you'll have a positive or negative result. The device itself isn't large—about the size of a portable speaker—which makes it feasible to take out to restaurants and other people's houses.\n\nRight now, the company says the mini lab can detect milk and gluten, up to five parts per million, but the goal is to detect other major allergens, like egg, fish, soy, sesame, peanuts shellfish, tree nuts. Of course, I have no way to actually test whether it can detect milk and gluten at this time, so I can't necessarily endorse the product. In fact, it isn't currently available: Allergen Alert tells me the product is supposed to launch in September for $200.\n\nHowever, if Allergen Alert is correct in its claims, this product could be a game changer. A two minute check on that supposedly allergen-free meal could literally save someone's life, and offer peace of mind to those who could have serious adverse effects from ingesting an allergen.\n\nBirdfy brings a new smart bird feeder concept to CES just about every year. And while the company had its previous models on display at Unveiled this year, its newest prototype grabbed my attention.\n\nThe Hum Bloom is not meant for all of the birds that visit your house or garden. Instead, this product is specifically designed for hummingbirds. The Hum Bloom has an 4K camera that can shoot up to 120fps slow-motion video. While that'd make for some dramatic landings for any bird, it's particularly ideal for capturing hummingbirds that flap their wings hundreds or thousands of times per minute.\n\nBirdfy says the Hum Bloom's AI can identify more than 150 hummingbird species, so you'll know which type of bird you're watching in slo-mo on your phone. Birdfy claims the feeder is \"leak-proof,\" and also comes with ant moat to keep out bugs. Personally, I'm stuck on Birdfy designing a slo-mo camera system just for hummingbirds. I look forward to seeing that footage from reviewers in the future.\n\nThis is one of those products my picture will simply not do justice. In order to understand why I was so taken by this speaker, you'd need to hear it for yourself.\n\nAdmittedly, I wasn't expecting much when I agreed to demo the speaker. Again, at first glance, the Opsodis just looks like your typical wireless speaker. That changed once the rep played a video on a connected iPad: Suddenly, I was hearing sounds next to my ears; behind my ears; around my ears. I wasn't really paying attention to what was happening on screen, because I was too distracted wondering how I was hearing everything I was hearing from a relatively tiny speaker directly in front of me.\n\nAs it turns out, this wouldn't work if I had the speaker placed just about anywhere. The demo used Opsodis' \"narrow mode,\" one of three audio modes the speaker is capable of. Narrow mode is the stronger spatial audio experience, but requires the speaker to be placed close and directly in front of the user: specifically, 60 centimeters away, or 23.62 inches. \"Wide mode,\" which I didn't try, offers a \"softer\" spatial audio experience, while the third mode simulates standard stereo audio.\n\nWhile this won't necessarily offer a movie theater-like experience just by placing it in front of your TV, this was some of the most fun I had at CES Unveiled tonight.",

    "fullText": "In an Ashes series riddled with low-quality cricket, England's Jamie Smith managed to find new depths.\n\nSmith's dismissal on the second morning of the fifth Test against Australia was called \"one of the worst I have ever seen\" by BBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew.\n\nFormer England fast bowler Steven Finn, commentating on TNT, said it was \"completely brainless\".\n\nWith lunch approaching in Sydney and Australia attempting to burgle some overs to hasten the second new ball, the hosts asked Marnus Labuschagne to bowl some of his very occasional medium-pace.\n\nSmith had moved to a sketchy 46. His partnership with Joe Root - unbeaten with a masterful century - was worth 94.\n\nAustralia, without a specialist spinner, were employing the part-time off-breaks of Travis Head at the other end.\n\nLabuschagne had 13 previous Test wickets to his name, all taken bowling spin. He laid a blatant trap, with seven fielders back for him to bowl some gentle bouncers.\n\n\"We better describe this field, because it is remarkable,\" said Agnew on Test Match Special. \"Marnus Labuschagne usually bowls wrist-spin but is being employed here as a bouncer bowler. And there is nobody within reach of the batsman.\n\n\"You cannot be bounced out by Marnus Labuschagne in a Test match! This is just a bizarre passage of play.\"\n\nSomehow, Smith obliged. From the fourth ball Labuschagne bowled, the England wicketkeeper stepped back and attempted a flat-batted swipe.\n\nHe succeeded in picking out Scott Boland, the only fielder in front of square on the off-side, at cover.",

    "description": "The Jets finished out a dismal season with another blowout loss, this time losing to the Buffalo Bills, 35-8.",
    "fullText": "The final game ever at Highmark Stadium had an unusual preseason-esque vibe to it with Buffalo prioritizing resting key contributors ahead of the postseason and the Jets knowing that an upset win would cost them the opportunity to pick second in the NFL draft. However, despite quarterback Josh Allen only playing the first snap, the Bills never looked in danger of losing with veteran Mitchell Trubisky at the helm.\n\nBuffalo marched 80 yards on their first possession, which ended on Trubisky’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Dawson Knox, then doubled their lead on a six-yard run by former Jets running back Ty Johnson.\n\nAfter the Jets turned the ball over on downs near midfield, the Bills quickly increased the lead to 21-0 on a two-yard pass from Trubisky to Ray Davis, who also rushed for 151 yards.\n\nMidway through the third quarter Trubisky threw another touchdown pass to Gabe Davis and a two-point conversion to Keon Coleman to make it 29-0.\n\nJohnson second touchdown, on Trubisky’s fourth touchdown pass, extended the lead to 35-0 with 12 minutes remaining, this time with the two-point conversion unsuccessful.\n\nNew York had the last word as they finally managed to get on the board with 7:33 to go, on a short touchdown pass from Brady Cook to Andrew Beck. Cook also found undrafted rookie Quinton Skinner for the two-point conversion.\n\n-- While it might be considered embarrassing for the Jets to struggle against a Bills team that was mostly backups, it’s fair to note that much of New York’s defense was comprised of third and fourth-stringers. Four of the five starters in the secondary were Ja’Sir Taylor, Keidron Smith, Tre Brown and Samuel Womack. Taylor was acquired at the trade deadline and mostly used on special teams until last week and the other three have been signed or elevated from the practice squad in the past week or two.\n\n-- Two more undrafted rookies, who had been starting in the secondary – Dean Clark and Jordan Clark – did not start, so were presumably benched in favor of the above quartet, none of whom are rookies. That perhaps reflects their own struggles in recent weeks.\n\n-- The Bills moved effortlessly downfield in 11 plays on their opening drive, mostly by running the ball, but scored on a pass play as Knox was left all alone by a coverage bust, which appeared to be Taylor’s fault, although Quincy Williams also left a receiver completely uncovered. You aren’t going to stop any NFL team, even with their reserves in, if you have defensive breakdowns like that.\n\n-- The Jets didn’t start the game any better on offense as they went three-and-out on their first two possessions. That included a play where they were flagged for having 12 men in the huddle on the first series.\n\n-- New York became the first team in NFL history not to register an interception for an entire season and also set the all-time record for fewest defensive turnovers ever in a season. Brown had a potential interception deflect off his hands on Buffalo’s second drive and Williams dropped one in the third quarter. A Jets fumble recovery was also overturned by replay review.\n\n-- Cook may at some point be a solid backup or fringe starter, but the undrafted rookie has clearly been overmatched for the past month and it’s unclear whether throwing him into this situation will benefit him in the long run. While the Jets were even more undermanned than usual at the skill positions with Breece Hall and Isaiah Davis unavailable, Cook was still playing behind a full-strength offensive line, and his lack of production reflects his limitations. He ended up with just 60 passing yards on 22 attempts.\n\n-- It’s difficult to cite any bright spots from the Jets, who were outgained by 470 yards to 122 and didn’t register a single quarterback hit. However, Womack had seven tackles and a nice pass breakup in the end zone. He also would have had a fumble recovery if the runner hadn’t been ruled down. Womack was elevated from the practice squad yesterday so if he impressed the coaches, he would need to be signed to a futures deal tomorrow.\n\n-- The Jets ultimately lost each of their last five games by 23 points or more, as they were not remotely competitive down the stretch. This does not reflect well on the coaching staff, even though they can point to the personnel limitations which caused them to be so overmatched each week, and the previous few months where they were competitive and even won three of five at one point. This could mean the coaches have a shorter leash in the event of a slow start with a retooled roster next season.\n\nTrubisky picked apart the Jets’ inexperienced secondary, which didn’t exactly make things difficult for him, but it was an efficient performance as he completed 22 of 29 passes for 259 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nBrady Cook ➡️ Andrew Beck to get the Jets on the board pic.twitter.com/j96ZZIvk62\n\n— Jets Videos (@snyjets) January 5, 2026\n\nAttention now turns to the offseason with the draft and free agency on the horizon.",

If the Ravens beat the Steelers on Sunday Night Football, they will host Houston in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe NFL closes out the 2025-26 regular season schedule with the Pittsburgh Steelers hosting the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football. The game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET with the AFC North title on the line. The Ravens are a 3.5-point road favorite heading into the matchup.\n\nThe big news for this matchup is that Baltimore will have Lamar Jackson back at QB. He missed last week’s game against the Packers due to a back injury. He’s been banged up for much of this season but is still a proven upgrade over Tyler Huntley. The Ravens would have been an underdog in this matchup if Jackson couldn’t go.\n\nThe Ravens have to win to secure the AFC North and the accompanying playoff berth. They are 8-8 and win would improve them to 9-8. The Steelers are 9-7 and a loss would drop them to 9-8. A Ravens win would even the season series but give Baltimore the division record tiebreaker.\n\nThe winner of the game will secure the No. 4 seed in the playoffs. They will play one of the Texans, Chargers, or Bills depending on how Sunday’s results shake out.\n\nHere are the current AFC standings after the Christmas games:\n\nNew England Patriots (13-3) – xy\n\nJacksonville Jaguars (12-4) – x\n\nLos Angeles Chargers (11-5) – x\n\nx – Team has clinched a playoff spot\ny – Team has clinched division title\nz – Team has clinched No. 1 seed\ne – Team has been eliminated from playoff contention\n\nHere are the AFC North standings as Week 17 begins:",

    "description": "The Sporting Tribune's Fernando Ramirez writes about the grit from Jim Harbaugh's squad and how all eyes are on New England now.",
    "fullText": "The Chargers lost to the Denver Broncos 19–3 to finish the 2025–26 season with an 11–6 record, identical to last season.\n\nSunday was about going into Denver, playing the game, and getting out healthy before the playoffs begin next weekend. For the most part, the Chargers accomplished all three.\n\nJim Harbaugh’s decision to prioritize health proved to be the correct move, as the Chargers sat several key players including Justin Herbert, Derwin James, Khalil Mack, Quentin Johnston, Ladd McConkey, and Daiyan Henley, among others.\n\nThe Chargers will now travel to New England to face the second-place AFC Patriots in the Wild Card round. It sets up a Justin Herbert vs. Drake Maye and Jim Harbaugh vs. Mike Vrabel matchup in Round 1.\n\nDespite the loss, the Chargers’ backups gave the Broncos’ starters some trouble.\n\nWith Herbert sitting, Trey Lance (20-for-44, 136 yards, one interception) made the start. It wasn’t pretty, but it was just the sixth start of his NFL career.\n\nOn the Broncos’ opening drive, Bo Nix (14-for-23, 141 passing yards, 49 rushing yards) moved the offense down the field, hitting Pat Bryant for a 9-yard gain on 3rd-and-6 from their own 30. On the next play, Nix scrambled for 22 yards to the Chargers’ 39. Runs by RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin picked up a combined 21 yards before the drive stalled on a 3-yard loss by Tyler Badie, as cornerback Tarheeb Still sniffed out the play. Broncos kicker Will Lutz connected on a 24-yard field goal to give Denver a 3–0 lead.\n\nThe Chargers’ second drive was ugly—really ugly. On 3rd-and-5 from their own 40, Lance threw a pass to KeAndre Lambert-Smith, but the rookie receiver popped the ball up to Ja’Quan McMillian, who returned it for a touchdown to make it 10–0.\n\nJan 4, 2026; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos cornerback Ja'quan McMillian (29) celebrates with teammates after scoring a touchdown against the Los Angeles Chargers during the first half at Empower Field at Mile High.\n\nOffense was a struggle for both teams. The Chargers had three drives of 13 plays, while Denver had three drives of 15 plays, but neither team scored again until just before halftime.\n\nLance opened the Chargers’ next scoring drive with an 11-yard scramble, followed by a series of short passes to move the chains. He completed four passes to Keenan Allen for 17 yards—enough for Allen to earn a $250,000 bonus by reaching 750 receiving yards on the season. Lance also found tight end Oronde Gadsden for six yards and hit Lambert-Smith for an 18-yard gain while covered by Patrick Surtain. Cameron Dicker knocked through a 30-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 10–3 at halftime.\n\nComing out of the break, the Broncos’ offense stalled with a three-and-out, which the Chargers matched.\n\nNix generated some momentum on Denver’s next drive with a 37-yard catch-and-run to tight end Evan Engram. However, after a run for no gain by Harvey and two incompletions, Lutz converted a 26-yard field goal to extend the lead to 13–3.\n\nAfter two Chargers punts and one Broncos punt, Nix faced 3rd-and-1 from his own 28. He handed the ball to Harvey, but undrafted rookie linebacker Marlowe Wax shot through and made the stop for a one-yard loss.\n\nThe Chargers got the ball back at their own 24 when Nik Bonitto strip-sacked Lance, with Denver recovering. The Chargers’ defense responded, as defensive tackle Justin Eboigbe recorded one of his two sacks on 3rd-and-11 from the 21 to force a 41-yard Lutz field goal, pushing the score to 16–3.\n\nJan 4, 2026; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos linebacker Nik Bonitto (15) hits Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Trey Lance (5) during the third quarter at Empower Field at Mile High.\n\nThe Bolts continued to show fight, particularly on defense. With defensive coordinator Jesse Minter’s name circulating as a head coaching candidate, performances like this only strengthen his résumé.\n\nDenver secured the No. 1 seed and will receive a bye, while the Chargers head to New England—a team they have never beaten in three previous playoff matchups.\n\nThe Chargers did suffer injuries to cornerback Donte Jackson, receiver KeAndre Lambert-Smith, safety Kendall Williamson, and edge rusher Bud Dupree, all of whom left the game.\n\nThose injuries will be worth monitoring, especially Jackson’s, as he is arguably the Chargers’ best cornerback.\n\nStill, the Chargers are back in the playoffs. With several key players getting much-needed rest, they should be ready for their Wild Card matchup against the Patriots.",

    "fullText": "UConn Men’s basketball four wins away from program history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe No. 4 UConn men’s basketball team is not only dominating the regular season, but it is also chasing history. The Huskies recently set a modern-era NCAA Tournament record with 13 consecutive March Madness wins, a streak that began during their 2023 national championship run and continued through the 2025 tournament before ending in the Round of 32. That achievement tied Duke’s historic mark from 1991–93 and further cemented UConn’s status as one of college basketball’s elite programs.\n\nNow, the Huskies are closing in on another major milestone. With their current winning streak, UConn needs three more victories to tie the longest winning streak in program history. Upcoming matchups against Providence, DePaul, and Seton Hall will decide if the Huskies can reach that mark. If UConn defeats Georgetown after that stretch, it would set a new program record for most consecutive wins.\n\nUConn continued its impressive run Sunday afternoon with a 73–57 wire-to-wire win over Marquette at Gampel Pavilion. The Huskies never trailed and earned their 10th straight victory, improving to 14–1 overall and 4–0 in BIG EAST play.\n\nThe win matched UConn’s best start through 15 games under head coach Dan Hurley and marked the fourth straight season the Huskies have posted a winning streak of at least 10 games.\n\nSolo Ball led UConn with 17 points and added a season-high eight rebounds, along with a steal and a block in a strong all-around performance. Silas Demary Jr. finished with 14 points despite dealing with foul trouble, while Tarris Reed Jr. contributed 13 points and nine rebounds, just missing a double-double.\n\nFrom the opening tip, UConn set the tone with physical defense and strong play in the paint. Back-to-back dunks and consistent interior scoring helped the Huskies build a double-digit lead in the first half. A late basket by Reed sent UConn into halftime ahead 37–29.\n\nThe second half belonged to the Huskies. UConn opened with a quick scoring run, highlighted by a three-pointer from Ball, and stretched the lead to as many as 20 points. Marquette struggled to find any offensive rhythm, shooting just over 32 percent from the field.\n\nDefense and rebounding were key to the victory. UConn finished with a 49–37 advantage on the boards, controlled second-chance opportunities, and blocked eight shots as a team. Jaylin Stewart, Alex Karaban, and freshman Eric Reibe all made important contributions, especially on defense. Reibe continued his steady play by grabbing at least five rebounds for the eighth time this season.\n\nWith the win, UConn has now defeated Marquette six straight times and remains unbeaten in BIG EAST play. As the Huskies prepare to face Providence next, they continue to build momentum and move closer to making program history.\n\nRick Pitino reacts to St. John’s opening win\n\nOhio State loses point guard commitment\n\nAJ Dybansta makes debut for BYU\n\nJalen Rose on TNT college basketball coverage",

Obviously that is much easier said than done.\n\nThis upcoming offseason is one of the most important and critical in recent Cowboys history as they have multiple first-round draft picks for the first time since 2008. With the Cowboys now officially done for the season, we know where they will be picking come the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHere are the first 12 picks of the draft, through the Cowboys selection at number 12 overall, courtesy of Tankathon.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar it is because it is… the Cowboys held the 12th overall pick last year and used it to select Tyler Booker. They also used it in 2021 to select Micah Parsons, more on him in a moment, although they picked it up after trading back two spots. For what it’s worth the Detroit Lions held the pick in consecutive seasons beginning the year after and landed Jameson Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs, so hopefully that type of success is what the Cowboys find.\n\nWhile we know where the Cowboys are picking, it is still unknown exactly where their other first-round pick will land. Dallas holds Green Bay’s selection in the 2026 NFL Draft and the Packers are currently set to visit the Chicago Bears in the Wild Card Round which means we are all rooting for Chicago to take care of business.\n\nKeep in mind that Dallas has also already dealt away 2026 draft capital as well.\n\n2nd: Dealt away in Quinnen Williams trade\n\n3rd: Dealt away in George Pickens trade\n\n6th: Dealt away in Jordan Phillips trade with New York Giants in early 2024, also received a 7th that was sent to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Logan Wilson\n\n7th (Kansas City’s): Acquired from the Chiefs when Dallas sent them Peyton Hendershot in early 2024\n\n7th (their own): Dealt away when Dallas traded for Kaiir Elam in early 2025\n\nThe Cowboys are projected to receive a couple of compensatory picks as well, potentially in the fifth-round, but those are not fully known at this time.",

    "fullText": "Florida football landed a Power 4 conference quarterback out of the transfer portal, securing a commitment Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo brings dual threat ability and familiarity with the scheme under new Florida Gators offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner, who was his offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech for the last two seasons. He visited UF over the weekend along with teammate and wide receiver Bailey Stockwell.\n\nA redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo showed promise as a backup quarterback in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets, throwing for 938 yards with 2 TDs to 3 interceptions over two seasons while rushing for 95 yards and 1 TD. Philo has appeared in seven games over two seasons and while alternating with starter Haynes King, helped lead Georgia Tech to a 28-23 upset win over Miami on Nov. 9, 2024.\n\nA three-star recruit out of Prince Andrew Christian School in Bogart, Ga., Philo broke Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence's high school record for passing yards in the state of Georgia with 13,922 yards during his prep career.\n\nPhilo will compete with redshirt freshman Tramel Jones Jr. for the starting quarterback job at Florida. Jones, who announced his intention to return to UF in December, completed 21 of 35 passes for 191 yards and 2 TDs in two games as former UF quarterback DJ Lagway's backup last season. Florida also brings back redshirt sophomore quarterback Aidan Warner and adds incoming four-star freshman quarterback Will Griffin, who plans to enroll at UF this month for the spring semester.\n\nPhilo joins Baylor safety DJ Coleman as the second commitment in UF's 2026 transfer portal class.\n\nKevin Brockway is The Gainesville Sun’s Florida beat writer.

In overtime, it was Sidney Crosby who scored the winner to help Pittsburgh get its fifth-straight win.\n\n“It felt great,” Rakell said postgame on Sunday. “We were pushing throughout the whole period there, and we felt like we were close so many times. But their goalie (Jet Greaves) played a really good game for them, and didn’t make it easy for us. But everybody on our team did such a good job tonight.”\n\nRakell believes the Penguins are coming together as a team, and the winning streak is a big part of it.\n\n“I think I just like our whole team game,” Rakell said. “Everybody knows that they’re very important part of us having success, and when everybody is doing their job every night, I think it gives us a good chance to win.”\n\nWith the win, the Penguins improved to 20-12-9 and are holding onto the top Wild Card spot. It was a great comeback win, which Pittsburgh believes can propel them.\n\n“It’s a great response by us,” goaltender Arturs Silovs said. “Guys are flying, we’re shooting, producing a lot of shots. Started to win a lot of offensive position, getting the changes and outworking them, and get rewarded.”\n\nPittsburgh will return to the ice on Thursday at home against the New Jersey Devils.\n\nMore Penguins: Dan Muse Praises Newly-Acquired Yegor Chinakhov After Recording First Penguins Goal\n\nThe post Sidney Crosby Helps Penguins Complete Comeback To Extend Win Streak appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "Moral injury—psychological harm incurred from committing, witnessing, or being subject to actions that violate one’s moral code—has officially been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), thanks to research led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The APA included “moral problem” in the newest version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the handbook for classifying and diagnosing mental health conditions used by U.S. mental health care providers.\n\nIn a Sept. 16 Psychology Today article, Tyler VanderWeele, John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology and director of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard (HFH), and Jennifer Wortham, a research associate at HFH, described their research on moral injury and subsequent work with the APA.\n\n“Over the past several years, [HFH has] been trying to develop a more unified approach to moral injury and to moral distress that would be applicable to perpetrators, witnesses, and victims,” they wrote. “After months of synthesis of prior work, we defined ‘moral distress’ as ‘distress that arises because personal experience disrupts or threatens: (a) one’s sense of the goodness of oneself, of others, of institutions, or of what are understood to be higher powers, or (b) one’s beliefs or intuitions about right and wrong, or good and evil.’ When that distress became sufficiently persistent it would constitute ‘moral injury.’”\n\nVanderWeele and Wortham introduced this definition, and the research behind it, in a March 4 Frontiers in Psychology study. The study sparked collaboration with the APA to ensure that moral injury was incorporated into the DSM.\n\n“Our hope is that [inclusion in the DSM] opens important opportunities for awareness and treatment of moral trauma, moral distress, and moral injury,” VanderWeele and Wortham wrote in the Psychology Today article. “If we are to truly provide person-centered care, the very real possibility of moral distress and moral injury needs to be acknowledged. The present recognition within psychiatry is a step forward in this regard.”\n\nRead the study: Moral trauma, moral distress, moral injury, and moral injury disorder: definitions and assessments\n\nRead the Psychology Today article: The Importance of Recognizing Moral Trauma in Clinical Care\n\nRead an HFH press release: DSM recognizes moral injury, thanks to Human Flourishing Program research\n\nMedia Relations Manager in the Office of Communications",

    "description": "The US's highly elite but secretive Delta Force captures and eliminates high-value targets. They reportedly helped capture Venezuela's Maduro.",
    "fullText": "At the center of the US operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife was an elite and secretive special operations group, per multiple reports.\n\nCiting officials, outlets like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Delta Force, alongside law enforcement personnel, carried out the extraction of Maduro as part of Operation Absolute Resolve, a surprise nighttime raid of the Venezuelan leader's compound in Caracas.\n\nBusiness Insider wasn't able to independently confirm the participation of the elite unit in the operation. The Pentagon directed BI's queries to the White House.\n\nIn discussions of the complex operation, President Donald Trump said only that it was executed by \"the most highly trained soldiers in the world,\" adding that \"there's nobody that has their talent.\"\n\nThe president may have been speaking about all of the personnel involved. US officials said that the operation to grab Maduro included land, air, sea, space, cyber, and intelligence forces. But Trump's language could easily apply to Delta Force, a top-tier special operations unit.\n\nHere is what we know about this elite force.\n\nDelta Force, officially known as the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (SFOD-D), is tasked with capturing and eliminating high-value targets. Like other tier-one special mission units, such as SEAL Team 6, Delta Force tackles some of the US Army's most covert and complex tasks.\n\nThe special operations unit, founded by Col. Charlie Beckwith in the 1970s for direct combat action, unconventional warfare, and counterterrorism, is headquartered at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, also home to other Army special operations forces.\n\nOperators train for rapid infiltration and exfiltration, intense close-quarters combat, precision marksmanship, demolition, hostage rescue, and more. Unlike some other units, Delta pulls the best warfighters it can from across the US armed forces, though it mainly draws from Army special operations forces. Known as \"quiet professionals,\" Delta Force operators generally do not speak openly about their activities.\n\nMuch of the elite force's work is highly classified, but some Delta missions are public knowledge.\n\nDelta Force was involved in the US operation, Just Cause, that ultimately led to the capture of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega during the 1989 invasion of Panama. And the group distinguished itself during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, made famous by the book and film \"Black Hawk Down.\" Two snipers were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions.\n\nThis century, this unit was among the US special operations forces that surged into Afghanistan immediately after the 9/11 attacks, played a role in the 2003 capture of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and was involved in the death of the infamous Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019.\n\nAnd now reporting indicates Delta Force, along with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, was instrumental in capturing Maduro.\n\nThe US president and other US officials shared details of the raid that captured Maduro on Saturday.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the apprehension team broke into a fortified compound to capture Maduro after months of planning. US intelligence agencies watched and studied his patterns of life, while other teams trained for the operation on a replica of Maduro's home. The US used a similar tactic to ready for the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound.\n\nReports indicate Delta Force was inserted into the target area by the 160th SOAR, the Night Stalkers famous for their ability to get special operators in and out of tough spots.\n\nWith fighters, bombers, electronic warfare planes, and more delivering strikes and providing air cover, Caine said the helicopters carrying the extraction team were able to reach their target with \"totally the element of surprise.\"\n\nDuring the complex apprehension operation, American operators moved fast through the building to find Maduro and his wife, seizing them before they could get the door closed on a steel safe room.\n\nTrump said that Venezuela's military was overwhelmed by US forces. Several American personnel were injured, the president said, and one of the helicopters was hit but remained flyable. No troops or equipment were lost in the operation.\n\nThe Trump administration is holding Maduro responsible for supporting narco-terrorism (drug trafficking) and other criminal activity. The recent operation is also about oil, with the administration accusing Venezuela of using oil revenue to fund malign activities. Maduro has denied the allegations.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that the US would run Venezuela until a \"safe, proper\" election could occur. He also said that US oil companies would be entering the country, which has the world's largest proven crude oil reserves.\n\nTo secure these operations, he said that he's not ruling out putting US troops on the ground. He said the US military is ready to conduct more attacks if needed.\n\nUS Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro and his wife were charged in New York with drug and weapons offenses. He is due to appear in court.",

    "description": "A former McKinsey consultant shares what he had to unlearn from consulting to succeed in startup life.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nathan Wangliao Yinan, the CEO and cofounder of Singapore-based AI startup Havana. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment history.\n\nAfter university, I didn't have the risk appetite to start something immediately. I joined McKinsey in the UK in 2018 because they actively encouraged me to do something different after two years there.\n\nI was at McKinsey for slightly under three years. I met a lot of people who were from different walks of life, and that made me feel it's OK to go and do different things.\n\nMy first manager had been a doctor in the UK who left practice because she felt the healthcare system was broken. She joined McKinsey to do healthcare work. One of my favorite bosses had been in the US Marines and went to Iraq. He did an MBA and joined the firm after that.\n\nI moved back to Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and McKinsey became less fun because everything was remote. The thing I enjoyed most — the people — began to decline.\n\nI knew I wanted to start something, but I realized I was pushing it off because it was hard to make a move during the pandemic. At some point, it felt like I was doing my job out of inertia.\n\nI left McKinsey in 2021 at the age of 27 and worked at a Singapore-based AI startup for two years, leading the go-to-market strategy.\n\nI went from being in a huge office with all kinds of perks to being in a coworking space with just two other people, and we had to figure everything out from scratch.\n\nI told my founder in the first month, \"Maybe I should just go back to McKinsey because this feels too scary.\" I don't know if the company will be around in a year. What if I need to look for a job?\n\nA lot of it is irrational because, honestly, we raised a lot of money, and we were a good company, and I'm sure I could find a job.\n\nThe startup was acquired in 2023, and I cofounded Havana, a startup specializing in AI agents for student recruitment and enrollment teams.\n\nI was told that the most important and hardest thing in a startup is managing my own psychology.\n\nIt's not learning how to build a new product or how to sell. If you are able to manage your psychology, then you will have the morale to learn all these things. As long as you work hard and you're capable, anyone can figure these things out. Most people, at some point, lose morale, or they just feel like it sucks too much.\n\nThere are a lot of things that can distract you. You can think, \"Oh, my other friends are doing X, Y, Z, and their life seems easier.\" You have to learn to shut down these distracting thoughts when you are in a career with a lot of openness and uncertainty.\n\nThe most important skill I learned at McKinsey is how to navigate clients.\n\nTypically, they are more senior and older than us. They have multiple departments, and you need to know how to run a meeting efficiently and understand everyone's needs. The startup that I'm running now sells to universities, which are bigger than us, so that's a useful skill.\n\nConsulting also trained me to be organized and structured. I learned to prioritize ruthlessly and do things fast because timelines are always tight.\n\nThere are also some things I had to unlearn. Consultants are trained to overanalyze and rely on data to figure out the most optimal solution. That's OK for big companies.\n\nIn a startup, when you're trying to make decisions, you'll never have enough data. You just have to have the guts to do one thing. If it doesn't work, go and do the second thing.\n\nWhen I first left consulting, I struggled with that. I would take a bit too long to try to get data, talk to more people, and read more books before choosing the right path.\n\nEarly on, we conducted customer interviews before building the product. My cofounder and I would spend a lot of time discussing: Is this the pain point we want to solve? Does this feel big enough? What's the first version of the product we should build?\n\nIt's very ambiguous, like trying to get some kind of instinct through research. Over time, we began building the product and attracting customers, and then a bit more rhythm emerged.\n\nNow, I don't feel like I have to have all the knowledge. I'm comfortable taking risks and making decisions.\n\nAs a startup founder, I've also gotten a lot more comfortable with speaking more. When I was at McKinsey, my managers would say I needed to speak up \n\nIf you run a business and are the only non-technical founder, you have to talk to customers every day. They expect you to show up with a point of view.\n\nDo you have a story to share about building a tech business in Asia? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

Maduro has been indicted on drug trafficking and weapons charges and is now awaiting his first hearing in a notorious Brooklyn jail.\n\nIn a press conference on Saturday, though, Trump said that with Maduro removed from the country, the US would now look to tap the country's oil reserves.\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump called Venezuela's oil business a \"bust\" and \"nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping, and what could have taken place.\"\n\nWhile it's home to a fifth of the world's oil reserves, Venezuela accounts for less than 1% of global daily crude production.\n\nTake a look at how its reserves compare to other countries. This data, from OPEC, does not include oil sands deposits, which account for the majority of Canada's proven crude oil reserves.",

    "title": "From 'First Buddy' bromance to a feud to a thaw, here's how Elon Musk and Donald Trump's relationship has evolved",
    "description": "Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a complicated relationship. They've had some very public spats, but the two powerful men remain political allies.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump appear to be back on after an on-again, off-again relationship over the years.\n\nThe world's richest person and the two-time president of the United States weren't always close, but became singular political allies, with Musk calling himself \"first buddy\" following Trump's 2024 victory and donating more than $200 million toward pro-Trump super PACs.\n\nAt the beginning of Trump's second term, Musk was frequently seen on the president's side and served as the de facto head of the White House DOGE office.\n\nIn June 2025, Trump and Musk's relationship blew up after Musk criticized Trump's signature \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Musk even threatened to start his own political party. Trump threatened to \"destroy\" Musk's companies.\n\nTensions have cooled since then. Musk and Trump shook hands at Charlie Cook's memorial service in September, a reunion that Musk and the White House proudly shared on social media. In October 2025, Trump said he now had a \"good\" relationship with Musk.\n\n\"I like Elon, I've always liked him,\" Trump said.\n\nHere's how the two billionaires reached this point.\n\nJust before the 2016 presidential election, Musk told CNBC he didn't think Trump should be president.\n\n\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire added that Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies were the \"right ones.\"\n\nAfter he won the presidency, Trump appointed Musk to two economic advisory councils, along with other business leaders like then Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nMusk received criticism for working with the controversial president, but he defended his choice by saying he was using the position to lobby for better environmental and immigration policies.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, after Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Musk resigned from his roles on presidential advisory boards.\n\n\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk said in a tweet announcing his departure.\n\nMusk's goal for Tesla is to curb dependence on fossil fuels through electric vehicles, solar power, and stationary energy storage.\n\nDuring a January 2020 interview with CNBC, Trump praised Musk's accomplishments and intelligence.\n\n\"You have to give him credit,\" the former president said, referring to Tesla becoming more valuable than Ford and General Motors. \"He's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And he's doing good at rockets too, by the way.\"\n\nTrump called Musk \"one of our great geniuses\" and likened him to Thomas Edison.\n\nAs the pandemic gripped the US in early 2020, Musk clashed with California public-health officials who forced Tesla to temporarily shut down its factory there. Trump voiced his support for Musk.\n\n\"California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,\" Trump tweeted in May 2020. \"It can be done Fast & Safely!\"\n\nIn May 2022, Musk said he would unban Trump as Twitter's new owner.\n\nMusk called the ban a \"morally bad decision\" and \"foolish to the extreme\" in an interview with the Financial Times. Twitter kicked Trump off its platform following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire has called himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" and one of his key goals for taking Twitter private was to loosen content moderation.\n\nIn July 2022, Trump took aim at Musk, saying the businessman voted for him but later denied it.\n\n\"You know [Musk] said the other day 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican,'\" Trump said during a Saturday rally in Anchorage, Alaska. \"I said 'I didn't know that.' He told me he voted for me. So he's another bullshit artist.\"\n\nDays later, Musk tweeted that Trump's claim was \"not true.\"\n\nMusk stopped short of attacking Trump personally, but said he shouldn't run for president again.\n\n\"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset. Dems should also call off the attack – don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe continued: \"Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!? Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.\" Trump is 76 years old.\n\nSoon after, Trump went on the offensive, posting a lengthy attack on Musk on Truth Social.\n\n\"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he'd be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump said in a post that criticized two of Musk's ventures, Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\n\"Lmaooo,\" Musk responded on Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk's official purchase of Twitter in October 2022, Trump applauded the deal.\n\n\"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country,\" he said. He added that he likes Truth Social better than other platforms, echoing comments from earlier this year in which he ruled out a return to Twitter.\n\nMusk later joked about the potential of welcoming the former president back to his newly acquired platform.\n\n\"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!,\" the Tesla CEO tweeted in October 2022.\n\nMusk and other right-leaning voices in Silicon Valley initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis ended 2022 as Trump's best-positioned primary challenger. In November 2022, as DeSantis was skyrocketing to acclaim, Musk said he would endorse him. In March 2023, after enduring Trump's attacks for months, DeSantis prepared to make history by formally announcing his candidacy in an interview on Twitter.\n\nThe initial few minutes were a glitchy disaster. Trump and his allies ruthlessly mocked DeSantis' \"Space\" with Musk and venture capitalist David Sachs. DeSantis' interview later proceeded, but his campaign was dogged for days with negative headlines.\n\nMusk live-streamed a visit to the US-Mexico border on Twitter, which he had rebranded as \"X.\" Musk offered his support for one of Trump's signature immigration policies.\n\n\"We actually do need a wall and we need to require people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter, as everyone is doing that,\" Musk wrote on X. \"It's a hack that you can literally Google to know exactly what to say! Will find out more when I visit Eagle Pass maybe as soon as tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump tried to woo Musk during a meeting at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. According to The New York Times, Trump met with Musk and a few other GOP megadonors when the former president's campaign was particularly cash-strapped. After the Times published its report, Musk said he would not be \"donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nMusk said he \"fully endorsed\" Trump after the former president was shot during a political rally ahead of the Republican National Convention. Musk's endorsement marked a major turning point in his yearslong political evolution from an Obama voter. Days later, it would come to light that Musk pressed Trump to select Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nTrump announced Vance as his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe ticket, Musk wrote on X, \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nTrump, who ended the Republican National Convention primed for victory, stumbled after Biden abruptly dropped out of the 2024 race. He and his allies have struggled to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAmid Harris' early media blitz, Trump joined Musk on a two-hour livestream on X that garnered an audience of over 1 million listeners. The conversation covered topics ranging from a retelling of Trump's assassination attempt to illegal immigration to Musk's potential role with a government efficiency commission.\n\nIn August, Trump began to suggest that he \"certainly would\" consider adding Musk to his Cabinet or an advisory role. The Tesla CEO responded by tweeting an AI-generated photo of himself on a podium emblazoned with the acronym \"D.O.G.E\"—Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"I am willing to serve,\" he wrote above the image.\n\nIn September 2024, Trump softened the possibility that Musk might join his Cabinet suggestion of Musk joining his Cabinet. However, he also said that Musk could \"consult with the country\" and help give \"some very good ideas.\"\n\nMusk later expressed enthusiasm about the news.\n\n\"I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe later added that he \"looked forward to serving\" the country and would be willing to do with without any pay, title, or recognition.\n\nMusk joined Trump onstage during the former president's rally, hosted on October 5 in the same location where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024. Musk sported an all-black \"Make America Great Again\" cap and briefly addressed the crowd, saying that voter turnout for Trump this year was essential or \"this will be the last election.\"\n\n\"President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution,\" Musk said. \"He must win to preserve democracy in America.\"\n\nThe next day, Musk's America PAC announced that it would offer $47 to each person who refers registered voters residing in swing states to sign a petition \"in support for the First and Second Amendments.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO later told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he might face \"vengeance\" if Trump loses the election.\n\nMusk was by Trump's side on election night at Mar-a-Lago, helping celebrate his victory.\n\nNearly a week after his 2024 presidential election win, Trump announced that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy were chosen to lead a newly minted Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE, as Musk liked to call it, in reference to the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin).\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pay the way for my Administration to dismantle the Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nOutside of administrative duties, Musk's presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club was so constant that Trump joked he couldn't \"get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Elon won't go home,\" Trump told NBC News jokingly\n\nThe pair's close relationship grew into a more personal friendship. Musk was seen attending Trump's Thanksgiving dinner and on the golf course with Trump and his grandchildren, where Kai Trump said he achieved \"uncle status.\"\n\nTrump dismissed concerns that Musk would be running the country, adding in a barb that the billionaire couldn't even be in charge if he wanted to, since he was born in South Africa.\n\n\"No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump said in December 2024. \"And I'm safe. You know why? He can't be? He wasn't born in this country.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after Musk flexed his influence to help shut down a bipartisan emergency spending bill earlier that month. Some Republicans questioned why Trump hadn't been more active in derailing the bill, and Democrats baited the President-elect on social media with posts about Musk \"calling the shots\" and taking on the role of a \"shadow president.\n\nTrump was sworn into office on January 20. Several tech leaders were in attendance, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The \"first buddy\" was also front and center for Trump's inauguration.\n\nMusk took the stage to celebrate at an inauguration event at the Capital One Arena, where he sparked accusations over a gesture he made that some said resembled a Nazi salute. Musk denied the allegations.\n\n\"Hopefully, people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi,\" he said during an interview with Joe Rogan.\n\nThough Musk quickly became the face of the DOGE effort, White House court filings said he had \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"\n\nIn the February 2025 filing, Musk was described as a senior advisor to Trump with \"no greater authority than other senior White House advisors.\" Officials also called him a \"special government employee.\"\n\nTrump told reporters they can call Musk \"whatever you want.\"\n\nThe White House later named Amy Gleason, who previously worked for US Digital Service, as the acting DOGE administrator.\n\nMusk's companies struggled to escape the almost daily DOGE-related news cycles.\n\nProtests, boycotts, and vandalism at Tesla dealerships spread across the US.\n\nIn March, Trump stepped in to defend Musk's electric car company, with Teslas on the South Lawn of the White House. Trump later wrote that he'd purchased a Tesla to show support for Musk.\n\n\"The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThree months into DOGE's mission to reshape the federal workforce, Musk announced that he would be stepping back from the effort. He broke the news during an underwhelming Tesla earnings call, where earnings per share were down 71% year over year.\n\n\"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" Musk said during the call. He added that \"the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency\" had been completed.\n\nAt the time, Musk said he would keep spending one or two days each week on governmental duties, so long as Trump wanted him to do so.\n\nOn June 30, Musk doubled down on his calls for another political party. He also vowed to defeat politicians who support Trump's bill.\n\n\"They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,\" Musk wrote on X.\n\nTrump responded on July 1 on Truth Social, suggesting that DOGE could be turned on its former chief.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk followed up with more posts on X proclaiming his opposition to the spending bill.\n\nTrump signed his signature bill on July 4, 2025.\n\nOn July 5, Musk said on X that he had formed the America Party to \"give you back your freedom.\"\n\nTrump responded on Truth Social that he was \"saddened\" to see Musk go \"completely 'off the rails,'\" essentially becoming a \"TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.\" Trump added that third political parties have never succeeded.\n\nLate in the month, Trump said that even though his signature domestic plan slashes EV subsidies, he's not out to hurt Musk's bottom line.\n\n\"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\"\n\nTrump's statement came a day after the White House appeared to suggest that federal agencies shouldn't contract with Musk's xAI.\n\nTrump and Musk were seen for the first time since their public falling out at the memorial service for conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nTrump, Vice President JD Vance, and a host of other top White House officials joined together in Arizona to pay tribute to Kirk, who was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nMusk and the White House later posted photos of the meet-up on X.\n\nTrump said that Musk came over \"to say hello.\"\n\n\"I thought it was nice, he came over, we had a little conversation,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after the memorial service. \"We had a very good relationship but it was nice that he came over. \"\n\nPOTUS x @ElonMusk \n\nFor Charlie. pic.twitter.com/Inaf8X81Gy\n\nMusk had previously said that the White House had invited him to an exclusive dinner for tech CEOs but was unable to attend.\n\nTrump said he and Musk had a \"good\" relationship and called their brief feud \"a stupid moment.\"\n\n\"He had a bad spell, he had a bad period. He had a bad moment,\" Trump told reporters when asked about their relationship. \"It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon, and I suspect I always will.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO still has beefs elsewhere. In late October, Musk called Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy a \"dummy\" amid a spat over who would lead NASA.\n\nTrump invited Musk to attend a dinner at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November. The event marks Musk's first public appearance at the White House since stepping back from the DOGE office in May 2025.\n\nThe guest list for the dinner included prominent CEOs such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk shared a photo of the event on X, which included himself, Trump, the crown prince, and Huang.\n\n\"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nOne day after the dinner, Trump joked about Musk in a speech at the US-Saudi Investment Forum.\n\n\"You're so lucky I'm with you, Elon. I'll tell you. Has he ever thanked me properly?\" Trump said.\n\nHours after news broke that the US had raided Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on January 3, Elon Musk posted his support.\n\n\"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"It is heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant,\" he posted again. \"Venezuela can now have the prosperity it deserves.\"\n\nThat same evening, Musk posted that he had a \"lovely dinner\" with Trump and Melania Trump, along with a photo of the three of them seated at a table at Mar-a-Lago.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmi Martinez (Aston Villa): It is going to sound very strange because it was a very comfortable Aston Villa win, but he made some key saves from Morgan Gibbs-White in the second half - just after Nottingham Forest got a goal back and it went to 2-1. He just kept them in the game.\n\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa): He was excellent. He has been excellent for a few weeks now but a massive outlet for Aston Villa. When they are dominant on the ball, he's the outlet on the right-hand side and got a lovely little assist in there as well. He is the main outlet and he really jumps off the pitch when you are watching the games.\n\nMalick Thiaw (Newcastle): From November onwards, he has been exceptional. He had a tough time in Italy but he is delivering consistently now. He scores a goal, which always helps for any defender in this team of the week. Solid performance, delivered, was more aggressive and I feel like he is starting to get his bearings now and feel like he is the man at Newcastle.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): Goal and an assist with the flick-on. I just think when they first signed him from Wolves, I didn't get it. Now I do. Especially under Keith Andrews. He organises well, he moves the ball really strongly from the back. He is the leader of that team. Forget Jordan Henderson, he is the leader of that team. Obviously goals help at centre-back.\n\nBen Davies (Tottenham): I don't think this is a name I ever thought I was going to put in but Ben Davies, fair play to him. He plays only his third game of the season, starts, they had Djed Spence on the bench as well - which shows the level of professionalism and maturity that he continues to deliver - and he gets a goal. It just shows to me that you don't always have to be 37 and written off. He's 32 and he's already been written off, he's got a World Cup to hopefully go to with Wales. He is always fit and available, which is what I really like.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): Two goals, leader, future England captain - do we need to say anything else?\n\nMateus Mane (Wolves): Eighteen years old, England youth international, doesn't have any noise, hasn't got any brothers with T-shirts saying to 'free him and let him play'. He goes out, plays, scores goals, gets an assist, gets the penalty and just delivers with no fuss. How beautiful is that? No fuss. I saw his interview after the game, he doesn't complain, doesn't get too over the top, just simple. Love it.\n\nJohn McGinn (Aston Villa): He obviously has to be in here. Two goals, the second goal he is obviously buzzing because the keeper made it so easy for him - but it feels like he has had a love-hate relationship with Unai Emery for about three years now. It has started to come to fruition. He has been a really important piece for this Aston Villa side.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): He gets a goal and it probably should have been the match-winner for Man City if we are being totally honest. They will feel like they should have won that game. Reijnders has got three goals in his last four matches and that shows his importance. He is growing. He had a really good start and then I think the reality of English football caught up with him for a period, but now he has got his second wind and he is playing well. He is going to be really important if City are to try to catch Arsenal.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Like me, you probably took him out of your fantasy football team thinking he had fallen off a cliff, and then he has scored every week since. So that just basically says more about my fantasy football managerial ability more than anything to do with his performances! But he is the rock, the leader, making sure he is right up there for that conversation for Brazil with the World Cup squad. You've got Joao Pedro, Richarlison, Gabriel Jesus - these are the guys who are all being spoken about. Even Neymar, but he's the one with the most goals, he is the one delivering with the most performances week in, week out. I'm backing him to make the squad.\n\nCody Gakpo (Liverpool): It was a game where Liverpool will feel they should have won it, nicking it in the 94th minute and then obviously Fulham score in the 97th minute. I think it is just one of those moments where you look at the team and you think no Hugo Ekitike, no Alexander Isak, who is going to step up and score the goals? To be fair to him, he's done it all season and that's why he goes in.\n\nRob Edwards (Wolves): First win for Wolves, a massive game against West Ham. I think in those games, because I have played in them, you need your manager to be resolute. To get you up but not get you over the edge and I think he just had both the tactics and emotion of the game spot on. Didn't go over the needle, didn't go under it and his team obviously delivered a massive 3-0 victory which gives them a fight - because if they had lost that game, relegation would have been all done and dusted. Now, hopefully they can get another win in the week and build on that momentum. For right now, it's huge for him and thankfully it is the first time we say something positive about Wolves all season - so massive kudos to Rob and his team.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

This stadium is not a happy place – and Frank is failing to provide the style or substance to change things.",

    "fullText": "When manager Arne Slot and Liverpool look back at this season, a crazy January afternoon when they drew 2-2 at Fulham will go a long way to summing up their misfortunes.\n\nWith top scorer Hugo Ekitike out with a muscle issue, Liverpool's struggles were compounded when one of their former players Harry Wilson opened the scoring in a first half in which Slot's side failed to test home goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\n\nYet they equalised through a controversial Florian Wirtz goal - and looked to have snatched victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Cody Gakpo scored in front of the away end.\n\nHowever, late substitute Harrison Reed fired home a contender for goal of the season from 25 yards in the 97th minute as Slot's side dropped points again.\n\n\"Losing that game would have been completely unfair to us,\" said Fulham manager Marco Silva.\n\nLiverpool extended their unbeaten run to nine games, but yet again their problems were laid bare.\n\n\"If you're not part of Liverpool, you think you'd win it,\" said Slot. \"But unfortunately I've been experiencing this for months now that the first chance the other team gets leads to a goal. The second thing is that the other team scores a goal you don't expect in extra time. So, is it then a surprise?\" the Dutchman said.\n\nWhat did surprise many inside Craven Cottage was that Wirtz's equaliser was confirmed after a video assistant referee (VAR) check - despite replays suggesting he was in an offside position.\n\n\"I was sure it was offside so I didn't even celebrate,\" Wirtz told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I felt the same. Many people inside the stadium felt the same,\" said Silva. \"It looked offside, but we have to believe the semi-automated technology worked well and did right,\" the Fulham boss added.",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior has flown to London to finalise his expected appointment as Chelsea head coach.\n\nAs BBC Sport reported on Thursday, Strasbourg boss Rosenior is the leading candidate to replace Enzo Maresca, who has left Stamford Bridge.\n\nTalks to appoint Rosenior are at an advanced stage, and the 41-year-old is in the capital to complete formalities before he is named as Maresca's successor.\n\nBlueCo – the investment vehicle set up to purchase Chelsea in 2022 – has started the process of identifying candidates to replace Rosenior at sister club Strasbourg.\n\nChelsea caretaker manager Calum McFarlane says \"there's a chance\" the new boss will be in place on Monday.\n\nUnder-21s coach McFarlane stepped in after Maresca parted company with Chelsea following disagreements with leadership figures at the club.\n\nMcFarlane's Chelsea drew 1-1 away at title challengers Manchester City on Sunday thanks to an equaliser in the closing moments from midfielder Enzo Fernandez.\n\nSpeaking after the match, McFarlane said: \"When I first took the job, I was told I would take the Manchester City game. So that was three days with the group.\n\n\"There's a chance the new manager will be in on Monday - that's what I was told originally.\n\n\"Obviously, it's Sunday now. We've been solely focused on the game. I'm sure I'll get more information once I'm out of this press conference. But as far as I know, the new manager will be in shortly and I'll lead the team until he's in.\"",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC and IBF belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.",

    "title": "How the sugar industry bought out scientists for decades",
    "description": "Researchers followed the money, and found out that the sugar industry has been gaslighting the entire world for fifty years. It was code-named \"Project 226.\"",
    "fullText": "According to a report just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a delegation from the Sugar Research Foundation paid off Harvard scientists to produce reports that falsely downplayed the role of sugar in coronary heart disease.\n\nYep. Sugar contributes to coronary artery disease, more than we have been led to believe.\n\nReports had linked both dietary sugar and dietary fat to heart disease as early as the mid-50s; by 1960 we knew that low-fat diets high in sugars still resulted in high cholesterol levels. So in 1964, the director of the SRF proposed that the group \"embark on a major program\" to dispute the data as well as any \"negative attitudes toward sugar.\" They found a group of Harvard nutrition scientists who would take their money, and started making plans.\n\nComplete with a codename, Project 226 was designed to protect the interests of the sugar industry by \"recapturing\" the 20% of American calorie intake they expected to lose once this whole sugar-isn't-great-for-your-heart thing percolated through into public awareness. It resulted in a two-part review published in the prestigious and influential New England Journal of Medicine, which hand-waved away huge swathes of research pointing out the risks of dietary sugar.\n\nThe authors went to absurd lengths to discount studies that didn't tell the story the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to tell. For example, to get the results they wanted, they had to throw out all the studies done on animals, because not a single animal study supported the conclusion they wanted. But after they finished their work, they reported that epidemiological studies showed a positive association between high dietary sugar consumption and better heart disease outcomes. The review concluded that there was \"no doubt\" that the only way to avoid heart disease was to reduce saturated fat.\n\nHow did this get past the sanity check at NEJM? The authors were experts, respected in their fields, and they were at least consistent cherry-pickers. They also conveniently failed to report that the Sugar Research Foundation funded their \"study.\" NEJM didn't start requiring authors to report conflicts of interest until 1984, and by then the sugar industry had floated comfortably on their 1964 precedent, funding study after study supporting their pro-sugar narrative \"as a main prop of the industry's defense.\"\n\nCan we finally talk about industry-funded studies? I'm not saying that scientists shouldn't be able to work for private research establishments. Obviously the money to buy the pipettes and reagents has to come from somewhere. But I am saying that there needs to be an unpleasantly bright spotlight on the financial resources enabling the scientific findings cited to support policymaking, whether political or medical. What industry would ever pay to support research that would put it out of business? Whether or not you're in favor of industry self-regulation, no matter whether the research is funded by taxes, commercial revenue, or charitable sources, everyone deserves policies that are made based on the whole truth -- not based on a callously selective interpretation of the facts that ends up lining someone's pockets at the expense of others' health. After how many deaths or lost person-years do the industry payoffs start being blood money?\n\nI for one, as a bench scientist, am mightily tired of hearing about scientists taking money to produce the right conclusion. This is the kind of crap Bill Nye was railing against in his comments that the industry barons who pay off scientists to fit the results to the desired conclusions maybe should be thrown in jail. It's prima facie fraud.\n\nThe peer-reviewed paper in which the scientists make this report is freely available from the JAMA(Opens in a new window), and that's how it ought to be. The only solution to corruption in science is to get more critical eyes on the whole process. There needs to be an independent body of investigative experts accountable to the public, who have to submit to a zealous and hard-hitting inquiry into their financial interests, and who can serve as a sanity check for advisory boards or legislative committees.\n\nWe need a Mythbusters for medical advice: someone who isn't a wholly owned subsidiary of the industry. Someone who can turn on the lights and force the roaches of corruption to scatter. Pay-to-win gaming isn't fair, and people hate it, and pay-to-win science is just as bad. It's about time to start paying the skeptics, because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nBut the only way we can do the above is if the science is accessible. How much do you think a subscription to every major scientific journal would cost, even at the discounted academic rate? The EU's Horizon 2020 directive provided hosting and access that made freely available all research funded even in part by EU money -- while the authors retain the right to license, patent or commercialize their work, the peer-reviewed papers reporting their results are now free, as in libre and gratis. When they publish in Nature or wherever, they also have to publish in the European Research Council's public database.\n\nWe should do that in the US, because hosting is cheap. Then maybe we could afford to hire people like Penn and Teller, Adam and Jamie, or Phil Plait and James Randi: people with faces we know and judgment we've checked, people whose stock in trade it is to root out misunderstandings and weasel words. Policy grounded in research needs to be officially subjected to the kind of person who just can't stand it when someone is wrong on the internet. Give us some accountability and tear down this paywall.\n\nResearch: doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5394",

    "description": "Our 2nd most-read article of 2025.\n- - -It’s so easy to label people these days. From the way folks have been talking, you’d think everyone falls ...",
    "fullText": "Our 2nd most-read article of 2025.\n\nIt’s so easy to label people these days. From the way folks have been talking, you’d think everyone falls into two buckets: those who voted against the mayor who promised to blow up the city and those who voted for the mayor who promised to blow up the city. And now that the mayor, whom I voted for, is blowing up the city, as he promised, I’m one of many people who are being unfairly blamed for something I didn’t want. Okay? I didn’t want the mayor to blow up the city like he mentioned many times; I just wanted him to fix the old bowling alley like he promised in passing once. Anyone saying I’m partially responsible for the explosions is just a sign that they have no argument.\n\nBefore you rush to cancel me, try to remember the mayor made lots of promises, and I didn’t expect him to keep them all. Yes, he promised to turn our playgrounds to glass and take a blowtorch to the schools; yes, he said that he was going to use napalm on every grocery store, but, as I said, he also promised he was going to fix the old bowling alley.\n\nOh, how I loved that bowling alley as a kid. It’s been closed for twenty years, so when the mayor mentioned he’d fix it if we elected him, I had to give it a chance. To be fair, he was also the mayor a few years ago, made the same promise, and failed to fix the bowling alley then. But he did live up to his promise to reintroduce smallpox into local daycares, so at least you know he can get things done, unlike the other guy who did neither of those.\n\nI’ve seen all the attacks online. You use the mayor’s own clear statements of purpose against me just because I consciously chose this. “The mayor said he was going to blow up the city.” Yeah, metaphorically. “The mayor brought up his desire to see the residents of the city cleansed by flame in every speech.” Sure, if you take it out of context, maybe. “The mayor’s election slogan was, ‘Blow It All Up and Watch Them Suffer,’” which is scary only for people stupid enough to take him seriously. The fact that he had to go so far as to pour gasoline all over the Burger King before throwing a Molotov cocktail through the window shows what his opponents have pushed him to do. It’s really his critics that have kept him from fixing the bowling alley.\n\nLet me reiterate: I do not approve of the mayor locking the doors of the mall and igniting a bus full of C4 in the food court. I may have worn a shirt that said, VOTE FOR THE MAYOR WHO WILL BLOW UP THE MALL FOOD COURT, but that was just my fun way of saying I only cared about the bowling alley. It makes me sad that you think I wanted people to get hurt by this. Especially when it’s something that directly affected me for the first time in my life, when my nephew was accidentally trapped in that mall when it exploded. Give me a little grace here. Plus, my nephew voted for the other candidate, so it’s kind of his fault that he ended up there to begin with.\n\nIs it so bad that I wanted the bowling alley back? Maybe that’s what you’re really mad about. You wanted the mayor to fail. The negativity around the smell of roasting pig is just a facile attempt to distract from his potential future successes. I bet the mayor is about to fix up the bowling alley, and I’ll walk in, and I’ll be twelve again, and all the adults will be so tall, and it will be my party, and everyone—even the kids who don’t like me—will have to sing happy birthday. The previous mayor said that rebuilding the bowling alley wouldn’t make it 1996 again, which, to me, is unacceptable.\n\nIt’s disgusting and, frankly, counterproductive to point out that I voted for this. To imply that I had personal free will and agency when I walked into a voting booth and picked Mayor Bomberman is insulting. Here I am, admitting that I did not actually want the mayor’s biggest promise to happen, and you’re criticizing me for directly being part of the reason it’s happening. You should be praising me for being able to admit that—well, not that I was wrong, heaven forbid—but perhaps my faith in the mayor who was arrested thirty-four times for arson was misplaced.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can imply that I “wanted this” as much as you like. You don’t know what’s inside my heart. The mayor said he’d fix the bowling alley. Just because he hasn’t fixed the bowling alley and announced that he’ll never fix the bowling alley, doesn’t mean I’m dumb or a fool. And while he may have also promised he’d re-segregate the city, crash the city’s economy, and turn the city’s only remaining functional hospital into a big Jersey Mike’s, I can guarantee that I only wanted the Jersey Mike’s.\n\nSo, no, I’m not “happy now” that our zoo has been turned into an open-air animal mausoleum. But of the options I had, only one mayor promised to completely change the city. And you know what? At least he is doing something. It may kill a lot of people. It may leave others without homes or jobs. But I respect a man of action, regardless of what that action is and whether or not it’s going to make things better or worse.\n\nNow, I’ll just sit back and wait for the bowling alley to get fixed.\n\nMike Drucker’s new book, Good Game, No Rematch, combines ridiculous personal stories and fascinating gaming history to explore the poignant ways that electronic entertainment can save us from ourselves. Or humiliate us, case depending.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett has officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Investors are focused on what happens to the company's growing cash pile.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) entered a new era at the start of 2026 as legendary investor Warren Buffett officially handed the reins as CEO to his protégé, Greg Abel.\n\nBuffett leaves behind stunning realized returns of 6,100,000% over the past 60 years, built on his value-investing philosophy of buying \"wonderful companies at a fair price.\"\n\nThe key question for investors now is what Berkshire will do with its record $380 billion cash pile as the AI boom sweeps across Wall Street and drives valuations higher.\n\n\"Berkshire is so big now that you have to find bigger opportunities to move the needle,\" Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIf it doesn't spend that cash, Berkshire could soon face pressure to start issuing a dividend.\n\n\"As a shareholder, the amount of cash they have is excessive,\" Boyar Research president Jonathan Boyar said.\n\n\"Since Buffett is gone, and he's the greatest stock picker of all time, I'd like them to deemphasize the actual stock picking and start paying a dividend,\" he added.\n\nBuffett and his longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, were known for a hands-off, decentralized approach that allowed Berkshire's sprawling subsidiaries to operate independently.\n\nThose businesses span industries from railroads and energy to insurance and retail, with holdings ranging from GEICO to See's Candies.\n\nThe conglomerate also has stakes in Apple (AAPL), a top-performing investment and, most recently, tech giant Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nAnalysts expect Abel, a 25-year Berkshire veteran with deep experience in the company's energy and industrial operations, to lean into that background as he takes the helm.\n\n\"Under his leadership, it's likely to be an important segment for the company and, I think, investors. Given some of the industrial- and energy-related demands that AI is generating, I think that could be an interesting franchise to watch within the Berkshire framework,\" CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAbel may also take a more hands-on approach to managing Berkshire's businesses.\n\n\"There's probably a lot of fat to cut,\" Boyar said. \"There's probably divisions that could be consolidated. There's many things that ... they could do to enhance profitability.\"\n\nGlenview Trust's Bill Stone agrees.\n\n\"Could Munger and Buffett have been very good managers?\" he said. \"They may have, they just decided they don't want to do it. They prefer to spend their time looking for opportunities. There probably is, and I think we've seen it already, some real opportunity to add some professional management and skills ... that I think Greg seems to bring to the table.\"",

    "fullText": "An Idaho man was checking his lottery tickets at a local store, and the clerk told him he had won $100,000\n\nThen, the clerk said, \"No, I got it wrong!\" after realizing his prize total was missing some zeros\n\n\"There was a lot of high-fiving,\" the man said of his reaction to his big lottery prize\n\nAn Idaho man — and longtime lottery player — was thrilled to learn he had won a sizable prize. Then, he got an even bigger surprise.\n\nSean Klingler of Rigby was recently at a local gas station \"hangout\" having coffee when he decided to check some of the lottery tickets he had stashed in his truck, per a press release and Instagram video from the Idaho Lottery. He quickly found out he had a winner on his hands.\n\n\"I had eight Raffle tickets, and when the clerk checked them, she told me I had won $100,000,” Klingler recalled of his Idaho $1,000,000 Raffle tickets.\n\n“I didn’t believe her. I thought maybe it was $100,\" Klingler recalled of his initial reaction.\n\nThen, the news got even sweeter when the clerk realized that there were some zeros missing.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n\"She said to me, 'No, I got it wrong — you won $1,000,000!' \" Klingler told the Lottery in the release. \"There was a lot of high-fiving in the store after that.\"\n\n\"It was kind of like a craps table when you're on hot dice,\" he added with a laugh in the Instagram video.\n\nAfter signing his winning ticket, Klingler called his wife and daughter to tell them the exciting news. He said he had to put the call on speaker because they didn't believe him and he needed everyone in the store to confirm the win for him.\n\n\"Yeah, we called [some more] family. Nobody believes you right out of the get-go. They always think you're fooling them. This will help,\" he added in the video, motioning toward his winnings check.\n\nKlingler, his wife and daughter drove to the Lottery's office in Boise on Tuesday, Dec. 30, to claim his prize.\n\nThe man told the Lottery he plans to take \"a responsible approach\" with his winnings. He will pay off a few debts, buy his wife a new car and then put the rest toward his retirement.\n\n“I’ve been playing the Lottery for a long time,” Klingler shared. “You dream about winning, and when it finally comes true, it’s weird.”\n\nOther prizes from this year's Raffle game remain unclaimed, including a second $1,000,0000 ticket sold in Kootenai County and a $100,000 ticket sold in Payette County. Another man, Kurt Blaisdell of Pocatello, won $50,000 in the Raffle and told the Idaho Lottery he planned to use the money to buy his fiancée an engagement ring.",

    "description": "There’s still a great deal to be learned.",
    "fullText": "A scientist in New England came across startling images captured by a trail camera, showing the first documented case of this strange insect behavior in the region.\n\n\"It almost looked like the moose had two [additional] eyes,\" Laurence Clarfeld, an environmental researcher at the University of Vermont, told Scientific American. \"At first, I wasn't sure what it was.\"\n\nClarfeld was describing a scene in which moths could be seen feeding on moose tears. He'd come across the surprising moment while reviewing footage from a camera trap in the Green Mountain National Forest.\n\nThe thirsty bugs weren't indulging in schadenfreude, but in lachryphagy, or \"tear eating,\" a process by which moths and other insects sup on the tears of larger animals — even humans.\n\nAnd yet, it's not the act itself that's remarkable, but where it happened. Lachryphagy has long been assumed to occur almost exclusively in tropical climates. Observing this behavior in Vermont confounds the still-quite-limited scholarly understanding of it.\n\nAccording to Scientific American, there is only one other known and documented case of lachryphagy outside the tropics. That instance took place in Arkansas.\n\nSo what is it about tears that bugs find so enticing? There's no definitive answer yet, but one possible explanation is the unusually high protein content of tears, which is 200 times that of sweat.\n\nOne of the biggest risks of lachryphagy comes from its potential to spread disease. Clarfeld and two co-authors published an article on the footage in Ecosphere in November. They posited that \"eye-visiting moths may be vectors for disease transmission such as keratoconjunctivitis, a condition that may induce eye lesions in moose, with significant health impacts.\"\n\nMoose are already at risk of afflictions like chronic wasting disease, so they hardly need another source of infection. Moreover, the dangers could heighten as rising global temperatures expand the travel ranges of disease vectors.\n\nThere's still a great deal to be learned about lachryphagy, especially now that it has been observed in an entirely new type of climate. For scientists, the chance discovery is a call for further research and awareness.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIt's also a reminder of why trail cameras are some of the most powerful tools in wildlife research. A well-placed camera can reveal enormously valuable information about the population and status of a species in an area.\n\nAs in this case, cameras can also uncover previously unknown behaviors that could further our understanding of nature.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "China Stopped Production On The World's Largest Particle Accelerator - Here's Why",
    "description": "China's ambitious new particle accelerator was meant to pick up where the Large Hadron Collider left off, but the project was put on pause. Here's the story.",
    "fullText": "Planned to be the largest particle accelerator in the world, China's Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) was meant to be about 100 kilometers or 62 miles long. That's much bigger than CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an approximately 27 kilometer circumference – or nearly 17 miles. These systems, especially the LHC, play a huge role in studying how the universe began during the Big Bang.\n\nDevelopment for CEPC started in 2012, around the time CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle; however, it appears the multibillion-dollar project is now paused. It was not included in the country's next five-year plan, spanning 2026 to 2030, which means it's considered a lower priority by the state — it will see less funding and resources. Wang Yifang from the Institute of High Energy Physics confirmed the change, but although the recent proposal to be included in China's five-year plan was denied, the team plans to resubmit the CEPC proposal in 2030.\n\nWhile it hasn't been directly confirmed, the CEPC would cost an estimated $5.1 billion, money that the country might want to divert elsewhere. In that case, Wang says if the European Future Circular Collider (FCC) – the next-generation collider that would effectively be LHC's successor with a much larger 90.7-kilometer (or 56-mile) circumference – is approved before the 2030 proposals, they'll likely join forces with the related teams instead.\n\nTo summarize, China's CEPC is out, likely due to cost and resource requirements, but the European's FCC still has potential, and the Chinese physicist team may join up if the proposal is approved before the next round of China's plans.\n\nDiscoveries from the systems we have operating now, like the Higgs boson discovery at LHC, occur because of how particle accelerators actually work. They fire particles into a big tunnel, or underground rings, which circle around at incredibly fast speeds before colliding. By observing these collisions, scientists get a glimpse into what the early universe looked like, as well as other foundational elements like quarks, the building blocks of visible matter in the universe. Scientists also used the system to create quark soup, a substance that hadn't been seen for billions of years before that. Generally speaking, when two particles collide, for the infinitesimally small span of time afterwards, scientists can see traces or patterns that are otherwise invisible — that's exactly how they discovered the Higgs boson.\n\nThe larger colliders, like CEPC or FCC, would not only introduce larger tunnel systems but more advanced and unique equipment, to uncover heavier or different particles, many of which the LHC simply cannot create. Imagine what kind of alchemy could be achieved with the larger, more capable collider systems.\n\nAs the current system, the LHC is expected to be phased out by the 2040s; meanwhile, the FCC, if approved, will begin development in the 2030s. That said, construction can't start quite that easily: Before anything happens, the CERN Member States and international partners have to give the upgrade project a greenlight.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Many people start the new year thinking about ways to improve their health, be more organized and manage their finances. Experts say there is one area that touches on each of those resolutions — home care.\n\nEarly and routine home maintenance goes beyond fixing visible damage. It helps ensure a healthy living environment, extends the life of a home and can protect its long-term value, according to real estate professionals. Planning ahead for regular upkeep and for unexpected emergencies can reduce the risk of costly repairs later and help spread expenses more evenly throughout the year.\n\nAccording to research by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, about three-quarters of existing homes are expected to still be in use in 2050.\n\n“Maintaining the homes that we have is really essential to protecting our health and our well-being,” said Amanda Reddy, executive director of the National Center for Healthy Housing, an organization that researches and advocates for reducing housing-related health disparities.\n\nDespite who owns the property, Reddy says, keeping residences dry, clean, pest-free, well-ventilated and safe is the goal, which can mean different types of maintenance depending on the type of home, where someone lives and the time of year. Here's what experts say about home care and what tasks to put on the checklist this year:\n\nHome care includes the big projects and the everyday decisions\n\nOn average, Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors, 70% of that time inside of a residence, according to the National Human Activity Pattern Survey.\n\n“It's not just that we spend time indoors, but at home. If you are older, very young, have health concerns, or work from home, it is likely more than that,” Reddy said, emphasizing the reason why home care is a valuable investment.\n\nWhat many people think of maintenance includes addressing water and gas leaks, pest infestations, cracks and other major repairs, but home builders say not everything needs a professional and can include actions as simple as wiping counters and sweeping floors of food debris, opening windows for better ventilation or clearing out clogged filters and drains.\n\nResidents should also consider the needs of those living in the home, commonly used spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms, and typically neglected areas like attics and basements. Reddy says “anywhere we’re spending time” or often ignoring and possibly missing necessary repairs should be prioritized.\n\n“At the end of the day, doing any preventative maintenance at all matters more than doing it perfectly or at exactly the right time,” Reddy said. “But timing can make a big difference. A lot of these tasks are seasonal or annual, and you’re not just going to do it one time. Homes are stressed differently by different times of the year, so seasonal maintenance helps us catch problems before they’re made worse by environmental stressors.”\n\nSeasonal maintenance to plan for throughout the year\n\nWhen it comes to maintenance, planning and preparing for anticipated and routine changes in the environment can help mitigate natural wear and tear on the exterior of homes and also create healthy conditions inside — where most people shelter from extreme weather events.\n\n“What happens outside the house rarely stays outside the house. What’s outside gets inside, what’s inside builds up,\" Reddy said, adding that fluctuating outdoor conditions put stress on appliances and systems at different times of the year. “For most people, the seasonal rhythm not only makes sense because of those stressors, it also just is more realistic and effective than trying to tackle a long, overwhelming checklist all at once.\"\n\nFor example, experts say the best time to prepare for cold and wet climate, storms and other natural disasters is to address concerns before temperatures drop. Similarly, it is recommended that residents address systems in homes that work to reduce the effects of extreme high temperatures, dry and drought conditions and associated risks like wildfires and air quality in the offseason.\n\nProfessional guidance from home inspectors, builders and real estate agents says spring and summer tasks should focus on preparing for warmer weather. Experts recommend checking air conditioning systems, cleaning dryer vents to prevent fire hazards, testing sprinkler systems, tending to gardens and plants around homes' exterior and inspecting appliances, electrical equipment and plumbing fixtures. Experts also say spring is a good time to clean and do any house projects that involve painting or remodeling since rain is unlikely to cause delays during that time.\n\nIn the fall and winter months, experts suggest focusing on temperature control and air quality measures as people tend to shelter indoors during incoming colder weather. American Home Inspectors Training guidance says check heating systems, clean air filters, make sure carbon monoxide detectors are working, seal air leaks, prioritize pest control, clean and repair roofs and chimneys, and inspecting drainage options in and around homes.",

    "description": "It may feel safe and comfy, but experts warn it could lead to lasting nerve damage.",
    "fullText": "It’s the same every morning. That tingling creeps into your fingers. And your shoulders? Stiff as always. You stretch out your arms and roll your shoulders until the feeling comes back. You get up, shake it off. Probably nothing, you tell yourself.\n\nJust slept weird, right? Maybe not. The way you sleep might be the real problem.\n\nFinds: This Pillow Literally ‘Cradles’ Your Neck So You Can Sleep Without Pain — And It’s Finally On Sale\n\nMany people don’t even realize it’s happening. They fall asleep with their arms relaxed, but by 3 a.m., they’ve curled in tight. Sleeping with arms bent, curled close to your chest, has been dubbed the “T. rex position” on social media. And while doctors don’t call it that, they do warn that doing it night after night can turn those temporary pins and needles into lasting nerve damage.\n\n“When you sleep with your arms bent and tucked in, you can press on the nerves in your elbows or wrists,” Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a sleep medicine specialist and chief medical adviser for Sleepopolis, told HuffPost. “This can slow blood flow and make your arms feel numb or tingly. If you do it often, it can also strain your shoulders and make them stiff or sore.”\n\nAccording to Dr. Matthew Bennett, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, some people also develop similar nerve irritation at the wrist, much like what happens with carpal tunnel syndrome. Keeping your elbow bent all night builds pressure where nerves pass through narrow spaces.\n\nTurns out, it’s surprisingly common — and it can steadily get worse over time.\n\nHealth: What We Get Wrong About Death, According To End-Of-Life Workers\n\nKieran Sheridan, a physiotherapist and founder of GulfPhysio, sees complaints regularly in his practice. Patients often describe a “dead arm” feeling or needing to shake out their hands in the morning. “This is your body telling you your nervous system isn’t happy,” he said.\n\nDasgupta also emphasized this. “If your arms or hands go numb every night, stay numb for a while after waking up, or start to feel weak during the day, it’s time to see a doctor.”\n\nWarning signs include shooting pain down your arm, trouble gripping things or even dropping your phone more often. Don’t mistake these for annoying symptoms or clumsiness. It’s your body telling you the damage is getting worse.\n\nBennett said anyone who notices these symptoms becoming more frequent should get checked. “Most cases are manageable and respond well to early, conservative treatment,” he said. Skip treatment, and that’s when trouble starts.\n\n“It’s usually temporary and goes away once you change your sleeping position,” Dasgupta noted. “But if the pressure keeps happening for a long time, weeks or months, it can cause lasting nerve damage.”\n\nCurling up feels comforting. It’s instinctive, like pulling a blanket tighter when you’re cold. However, there’s usually more behind it.\n\nThe body slips into self-protection even when there’s no threat. When the nervous system is on high alert from chronic pain, stress, poor sleep or trauma, Bennett said, “we may subconsciously adopt postures that feel safer and less exposed.”\n\nHealth: This Simple Scandinavian Bed Hack Could Be The Key To Better Sleep\n\nWe automatically search for safety during sleep. And for some people, that search runs deeper than others. Judit Merayo Barredo, a clinical psychologist, said she had a patient who came to therapy experiencing chronic insomnia and persistent fatigue.\n\nEvery night, her patient would wake up tightly curled, arms pressed to her chest, shoulders hunched in that T. rex position. “She often woke with muscle tension, a clenched jaw, and a feeling of emotional heaviness,” Barredo said, “despite sleeping for hours.” It turns out, Barredo’s client was dealing with heavy anxiety and expressing it in her sleep.\n\nThe first goal Barredo set for her patient was calming down her nervous system at night. They tried guided body scans before bed, pre-sleep journaling to get the stress out and also changing her sleep setup. The patient added extra pillows, softened the lights and built a routine she could actually stick to. Barredo said the “shift in her sleep position was one of the first signs that her body was learning to feel safe again.”\n\nOf course, not everyone sleeping in the T. rex position suffers from chronic anxiety. Everyday stress, trauma, poor sleep and regular tension can trigger the same response.\n\nHealth: This Extremely Common Social Habit May Actually Be A Sign Of ADHD\n\nThe problem is willpower doesn’t work during sleep. You can’t tell yourself to stop curling up in the middle of the night. So the aim is to make it physically harder to curl up using barriers and supports.\n\nBennett recommended something surprisingly simple: wrap a hand towel around your elbow and secure it loosely with an elastic bandage. This creates a soft barrier that makes deep bending uncomfortable without waking you up. If you have wrist pain, a wrist brace at night also helps.\n\nFor side sleepers, Sheridan suggests a couple of approaches:\n\nPlace a small pillow or folded towel between your arms and chest to prevent that full curl.\n\nHug a body pillow to keep your arms neutral while giving you something to hold.\n\nIf you sleep on your back, rest your arms by your side or on a pillow near the hips. Your arms should stay straight or just slightly bent. Don’t tuck them under your body or pillow.\n\nHealth: The Time It Takes To Fall Asleep Can Reveal A Lot About Your Health\n\n“Keeping the arms open allows for better circulation, less nerve compression, and faster muscle recovery,” Sheridan explained.\n\nSince this position often reflects a nervous system on high alert, Bennett suggested calming techniques before bed, like breath work or gentle stretching. “The goal isn’t rigid posture correction,” he said. “It’s offering the body more supportive options for rest and recovery.”\n\nIf you wake up with numb hands, stiff shoulders, or pins and needles in your arm, you don’t need a total sleep overhaul, just a few small tweaks. Tonight’s the night to make a change. The T. rex couldn’t change its position ― but you can.\n\n'Orthosomnia' Might Be Ruining Your Sleep.

While conditions improve for most areas on Monday, hazardous winter weather will linger into Tuesday near Lake Iliamna and the Western Alaska Range,\" the NWS revealed.\n\nA high wind warning is in effect for parts of Alaska starting from Sunday morning through Monday as the state braces for winds up to 115 mph. A high wind warning is issued when an area is hit with sustained winds over 60 mph.\n\n\"Take Action! Sustained, strong winds with even stronger gusts are happening. Seek shelter. If you are driving, keep both hands on the wheels and slow down,\" the NWS said.\n\nWhile parts of the state brace for extremely dangerous winds, other parts of the state will start to receive heavy snowfall on Sunday afternoon. \"Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches, with localized amounts up to 30 inches from Port Alsworth to Iliamna. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Visibility reduced to one half mile or less at times,\" the NWS revealed.\n\n\"Snow will develop by Sunday afternoon and continue through Monday before tapering off to snow showers by Monday evening. Areas of stronger winds, especially around Lake Iliamna, may produce blowing snow that could significantly reduce visibility.\"\n\nIn the event of a strong wind event, the National Weather Service warned residents to stay inside.\n\n\"Immediately go inside a sturdy building during a high wind warning or severe thunderstorm warning and move to an interior room or basement,\" it said. \"If you are in a mobile home, move to a sturdy building before the winds pick up or the storm system reaches your location.\"",

    "title": "LG's 'Aerominum' Gram Pro laptops feel impossibly light and strong",
    "description": "LG has finally fixed its flex issues thanks to the Gram Pro's Aerominum case.",
    "fullText": "For years, LG has pushed its ultra-light Gram laptops as a way to stand out from the PC crowd, for better or worse. I was't a big fan of the flex-prone case in the 2017 Gram, and we had similar concerns with the first 17-inch Gram in 2019. But in fairness, it's been a while since we've reviewed one, and we found a lot to like in our preview of last year's AI-equipped model. Now LG is back with a major Gram Pro redesign at CES 2026, which features a new aluminum/magnesium alloy it's dubbed \"Aerominum.\" And finally, it seems LG has found a balance between building a super-light notebook (the 16-inch Gram Pro weighs just 2.6 pounds), and crafting something that actually feels durable.\n\nAdmittedly, the Gram Pro doesn't look particularly impressive at first glance. It has a large 16-inch 2.8K OLED screen, which certainly looks nice, but doesn't really stand out from the glut of other OLED laptops on market. It's also powered by Intel's new Panther Lake chips, and it supports dual NVMe SSDs. The magic happens when you pick it up: My brain had a hard time computing how such a large computer felt so light in my hands. And best of all, it didn't flex much when I tried to squeeze the case.\n\nThere's still a bit of give, to be clear, but it didn't feel as precariously bendy as earlier models. I wouldn't stress too much about throwing it into a messenger bag without additional protection. The more I handled the Gram Pro, the more I wished other PC makers strived for similar weight reduction. The Gram Pro weighs about as much as the 13-inch MacBook Air! That's certainly an impressive feat.\n\nI just wish LG spent as much time refining the Gram Pro's keyboard as its case design. There's barely any key travel, which made for an unresponsive and unsatisfying typing experience. I get it, LG probably doesn't have the available vertical height for much key movement, but there are other ways to make typing feel more dynamic. The Gram Pro's trackpad, meanwhile, is serviceable, but it also didn't feel as smooth and responsive as what we see from Apple's notebooks or Microsoft's Surface Laptop.\n\nIn addition to the 16-inch Gram Pro, LG also debuted a 17-inch model with an Aerominum case, which is notable for being the lightest notebook at that size with an NVIDIA RTX GPU. Specifically, it's toting the RTX 5050, which should be enough to play most games at the laptop's native 2,880 by 1,800 resolution (or 1440p blown up a bit). Given the more powerful hardware, the Gram Pro 17 is heavier than the 16-inch model, but it still comes at a relatively light 3.8 pounds. I didn't get a chance to play any games on the laptop, unfortunately, but overall it looks like a decent option for someone who wants a large screen with a bit of horsepower.",

    "fullText": "It's in our nature to want more: More money. More friends. More muscle. More food. A more luxurious car. And, of course, more gains by way of the stock market.\n\nHow can I tell after a year in which the S&P 500's (^GSPC) total return was 17.88%, bringing the index's three-year total return to 86.11%? Because I am always getting asked by people for stock ideas, especially after years of the market basically moving up and to the right.\n\nAs a rule, I don't give out stock ideas, as that is no longer my career (I was an analyst for a decade). So I come to you at the start of 2026 with a tidy list of stock ideas provided by my contacts.\n\nI caution that I am not endorsing the picks of these money management pros. This is not me saying to dump your life savings into these stocks or even buy a single share.\n\nDo your homework on each one. In doing so, you may find you like other stocks in the industry better.\n\n\"One chip company in the world is fueling the AI revolution, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, the [earnings] numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15% to 20% at a minimum [earnings growth] going into 2026. You put that together, and I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026.\"\n\n\"We love Palantir. From a defense standpoint, they are the leader in AI and data, with Defense Department approval and usage. And then beyond that, corporate adoption and sovereign adoption. So we think the name continues [to go higher]. It's one of those names, you can't justify it from a valuation standpoint. But the narrative is quite compelling. And that can drive stocks for a very long time, like it did Amazon for the first 20 years of Amazon's post-IPO life.\"\n\n\"I think Broadcom is a little misunderstood. We were big buyers of it during COVID actually when it was giving you over a 3% dividend yield. So you know we like dividends. So what I like about it is the VMware side of the business and the programable side. These are very specialized chips. So not competing as much with Nvidia, and I think they're creating their own market. And I think their growth rate and the ownership has been tremendous.\n\n\"We've been trimming this position because it grew to so much in our accounts. I mean, we had up to 7% of our portfolio in Broadcom. We didn't want that much. We still like it, but we're not expecting the 5,060% return. We'd be very happy with Broadcom [returning] about 10%.\"",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",
