Braun finished with three points in 24 minutes while Gordon had 20 points in 21 minutes.\n\nBut without three-time Most Valuable Player Jokic it wasn't enough, thanks largely to the efforts of former Nugget Michael Porter Jr -- who scored 27 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in his first meeting with the Nuggets since he was traded in July.",

    "description": "The Cincinnati Reds should not trade their starting catcher Tyler Stephenson.",
    "fullText": "As the Cincinnati Reds weigh their options heading into the 2026 season, one of the more debated topics has been whether the team should consider moving catcher Tyler Stephenson. While the Reds are operating on a limited payroll and have another capable catcher on the roster, trading Stephenson would be a mistake for several reasons.\n\nFirst, his backup, Jose Trevino, is best suited for a defensive role rather than as a full-time starter. Trevino has earned both a Gold Glove and a Platinum Glove Award, proving his value behind the plate, but his bat remains a liability. He is most effective as a defensive replacement or in spot starts, not as the everyday catcher. That reality underscores Stephenson’s importance, as he provides offensive production that is rare to find at the position.\n\nStephenson’s versatility also adds value. Beyond catching, he has the ability to play first base, giving manager Terry Francona flexibility in constructing lineups. For a team trying to maximize resources, having a player who can fill multiple roles is critical. Trading him simply to address other areas of the roster would weaken the team’s depth and reduce options in the infield.\n\nIt is also worth noting that Stephenson’s trade value is not at its peak. He is coming off a down year for his standards in which he hit .231 with a .316 on-base percentage, .737 OPS, 13 home runs and 50 RBIs. Moving him now would mean selling low, rather than waiting for him to rebound to the level he showed in 2024, when he was a key offensive piece.\n\nStephenson will be entering his seventh year with the Reds after being drafted 11th overall in the 2015 MLB Draft. His connection to the organization and fanbase adds intangible value that cannot be overlooked. As a homegrown player who has delivered memorable moments, he embodies the team’s identity and helps drive fan engagement, which is vital for a franchise looking to sustain momentum and build its culture.\n\nFrom a broader perspective, keeping Stephenson allows the Reds to develop younger catchers at a natural pace. He can serve as a bridge until a long-term successor is ready, rather than forcing a premature transition. His combination of above-average offense for his position, defensive leadership and clubhouse stability makes a compelling case for Cincinnati to hold onto him.\n\nTrading Stephenson might seem like a quick fix, but in reality, the Reds are better positioned to contend by keeping him in the fold.",

    "fullText": "The post-match fallout from the Leeds United game on Sunday is threatening the engulf Manchester United, and could potentially derail the season.\n\nRuben Amorim came out with a bizarre rant as his team fought back to claim a point away at Elland Road.\n\nThe head coach suggested that he lacked the power to make key decisions, and was not being backed in the transfer market, while also being asked to shift from his preferred system.\n\n“I just want to say that I’m going to be the manager of this team, not just the coach. And I was really clear on that. And that is going to finish in 18 months, and then everyone is going to move on. That was the deal.”\n\nThose comments have not gone down well among the INEOS hierarchy with Talksport reporting that the head coach’s future now hangs in the balance.\n\nA power struggle with director of football Jason Wilcox has emerged behind the scenes, with the former Manchester City man directing the Portuguese tactician to change his rigid style.\n\nThe win over Newcastle and the improved second-half display against Leeds are clear examples that a shift to a four at the back suits the current injury-riddled squad.\n\nThe Antoine Semenyo saga has also upset Amorim, who wants INEOS to go and spend big on other areas during January.\n\nHowever, with most big names unlikely to jump ship mid-season, they are reluctant to back the head coach with more signings tailored to his specific style.\n\n“Ruben Amorim’s future at Manchester United is in the balance after his explosive press conference on Sunday, talkSPORT understands.\n\n“Amorim’s fractured relationship with director of football Jason Wilcox is viewed by sources close to United as making his long-term position uncertain.\n\n“talkSPORT understands Amorim’s frustrations have boiled over after United’s top brass including Wilcox urged him to be more tactically flexible.\n\n“If it comes down to a power struggle between Amorim and Wilcox chief executive Omar Berrada is expected to back the latter.\n\n“Amorim also feels promises he would be allowed to his squad in this transfer window have been broken, with United now planning a quiet January.”\n\nIt has been a difficult few weeks, both on and off the pitch, for the 20-time English league champions, with injuries and AFCON meaning the squad has been stretched way too thin.\n\nAnd the results have taken a beating, with Ruben Amorim’s adamant stance regarding his own tactical style not really helping matters.\n\nThe INEOS hierarchy are far from pleased with the lack of tactical flexibility and Christopher Vivell went to great lengths to point that out after the Fulham game earlier in the season.\n\nThe entire episode is eerily similar to the Enzo Maresca saga that erupted at Chelsea recently. And everything points towards a similar conclusion.\n\nFeature image Molly Darlington via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "They met two days prior to Sunday night’s encounter at Crypto.com Arena, a two-game set between the Lakers and Memphis Grizzlies reminiscent of a playoff series.\n\nThe Lakers won the first game Friday night and knew the Grizzlies were going to bring more intensity and a stronger effort even with star guard Ja Morant (right calf contusion) not playing.\n\nAnd that was the case, the Lakers falling behind by 16 points in the second quarter, the Grizzlies ramping it up in a big way. But with Luka Doncic, LeBron James and Jake LaRavia leading the way, the Lakers pulled out a 120-114 win.\n\nDoncic almost had a triple-double with 36 points, nine rebounds and eight assists. James had 26 points, 10 assists and seven rebounds. LaRavia, starting in the absence of Rui Hachimura, had 26 points, five rebounds and four assists. It was the second straight time LaRavia, who came in averaging 9.1 points, scored 20-plus.\n\nA back-and-forth game featured several lead changes in the fourth quarter, with the Lakers and Grizzlies taking turns delivering in tense moments. The Lakers finally took the lead for good at 100-99 on a basket by Doncic.\n\nThen James scored on a three-point play and made one of two free throws for a 104-99 lead with 3 minutes 49 seconds left.\n\nThe Lakers (22-11) had an answer for every Grizzlies counter, the final stamp on the game being Doncic’s back-to-back three-pointers for a nine-point lead with 2:01 left.\n\nThe NBA scheduling the Lakers to host the Grizzlies on Friday and again Sunday was not an issue for coach JJ Redick.\n\n“I like it,” Redick said. “I do think it does replicate [the playoffs] in some ways. A playoff series, particularly when it's not a home-and-away situation, but more of you're playing a two-game series on somebody's home court for the day in between. Had a few of these last year. So, I like this for our team and it's a good growth opportunity. Coming off a win, knowing that there's a lot of stuff that we can be better at and where can we make improvements. That's the big challenge to me.”\n\nFor Redick, that meant what it always does for the Lakers — improving on defense.\n\nRedick wanted his team to get back on defense faster and not let the Grizzlies (15-20) get so many early offense opportunities.\n\nThe Lakers also wanted to jump-start center Deandre Ayton from a five-game slumber.\n\nAyton had just four points on two-for-four shooting against the Grizzlies on Friday night and hadn’t scored more than 12 points in that span.\n\nSo, the Lakers went to Ayton at the outset, trying to ignite his game. It worked to a degree, Ayton scoring 15 points, grabbing eight rebounds and blocking three shots.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "description": "New Jersey native Brenden Aaronson's goal for Leeds United leads the way for Americans abroad, with Antonee Robinson and Christian Pulisic also in action.",
    "fullText": "In the 62nd minute of Leeds United’s clash with Manchester United on Sunday, Brenden Aaronson won over the Elland Road crowd with his first goal in more than two months.\n\nThe English Premier League match would end in a 1-1 draw, leaving Leeds in the bottom five, but for both the West Yorkshire club and the 25-year-old American midfielder, the goal was another bright moment after a November swoon.\n\nJust six weeks ago, Leeds manager Daniel Farke was so concerned about the relentless social-media criticism aimed at Aaronson that he spoke out with great passion. With Leeds unbeaten in seven straight and the U.S. men’s national team veteran playing well, both have been able to breathe easier.\n\nAaronson provided the lead Sunday, slipping into defender Ayden Heaven’s blind spot to pounce on Pascal Struijk’s well-weighted throughball. The New Jersey native then warded off Heaven before coolly finishing into the far corner for his second Premier League goal of the season.\n\nThe Red Devils answered three minutes later, but the result was good enough to extend Leeds’ run to 2-0-5 since a four-match losing streak in November. The Whites (5-8-7) sit in 16th place but eight points clear of the relegation zone.\n\n“It is great for the team to stay unbeaten,” Aaronson said, “but of course we wanted three points.”\n\nDescribing the goal, he said, “I just was kind of just running in behind to see if I could get lucky. Sometimes you have to take a chance. The ball came to me. I think that the centre back didn't know I was going to be kind of running off his shoulder like that. It was a good touch, and then it is just about putting it on target.”\n\nSince being demoted to the bench for four consecutive matches, Aaronson has started four in a row. Last weekend, he assisted in a 1-1 draw at Sunderland. His three assists lead the team and, combined with his two goals, he is tied for second in goal contributions.\n\nIt was a very different situation in late November, when fan anger prompted Farke to come to the American’s defense.\n\n\"I'm just worried how we are as a society, with social media stuff, how we are as human beings,\" he said at the time. \"You just see the negative comments. If you see 5,000 negative comments about yourself as a 25-year-old guy, you think the whole world is on your shoulders.\n\n\"I could make my life easy and also slam him and then everyone would say, 'Yes, Daniel, great, we don’t like him anyway.’ But I protect human beings. This is what I do. I work with human beings. I don't work with robots. I also see what this lad is doing. And he is always a fantastic teammate. He works his socks off.”\n\nFarke added, “Judge his performances, be at least a little bit fair. And if you don't want to do this in terms of relationship, come on, be a bit respectful with a young lad of 25 years old. And then, otherwise, we don't have to have all this mental-health awareness days, and we can put it into the bin.”\n\nA member of the 2022 World Cup team, Aaronson appeared in eight matches last year, with three starts, one goal (against Trinidad & Tobago at the Gold Cup) and one assist. He was left off the September roster, made one sub appearance in the October friendlies and, a month later, started against Paraguay and came in late against Uruguay.\n\nWith midfielder Tyler Adams and center back Chris Richards injured, Aaronson was among just two Americans in Premier League action over the weekend. Antonee Robinson, Fulham’s left back/wing back, went the distance in a wild 2-2 home draw with Liverpool.

On Sunday, Jan. 4, his whereabouts for the 2026 season were confirmed.\n\nHouser is heading back to the Big Ten, officially committing to Illinois.\n\nLast Ride. Let’s get to work!! I-L-L🔶🔷 pic.twitter.com/Cg2FEJOwGE\n\n— Katin Houser (@katinhouser) January 5, 2026\n\nHouser originally launched his college career at Michigan State where he took a redshirt in 2022 before becoming the primary starter in October 2023. The California native started seven games for the Spartans in 2023, throwing for 1,130 yards, six touchdowns, and five interceptions. Michigan State underwent a head coaching change that offseason and Houser started anew at East Carolina.\n\nThe fit was seamless as Houser spearheaded a bounce-back season for the program in 2024. He earned the starting role again in October, posting a 5-2 record while collecting 2,006 passing yards, 18 touchdowns, and 11 interceptions, as well as four rushing touchdowns. Houser guided the Pirates to a thrilling victory over rival NC State in the 2024 Military Bowl and then elected to run it back for 2025.\n\nEast Carolina was in the American Conference contention circle as late as November during Houser’s highly-successful 2025 campaign. The quarterback is currently 19th in the FBS with 3,300 passing yards, delivering 19 touchdowns to six interceptions on a 65.9 completion rate. Houser enjoyed his best rushing season to date as well, contributing 193 yards and nine touchdowns as a frequent goal line threat. ECU won its most regular season games since 2014, but Houser did not remain with the team through the Military Bowl. Still, the Pirates upset Pitt 23-17 as two-touchdown underdogs to cement a 9-4 season.\n\nHouser joins an Illinois squad that graduates three-year starter Luke Altmyer, who completed a successful stint with the Fighting Illini last week by winning MVP honors of the Music City Bowl. Illinois generated back-to-back 9-win seasons for the first time ever, and Houser will be tasked with continuing that newfound success.\n\nFor East Carolina, the Pirates have options. Chaston Ditta, who started and led the team to victory as a true freshman in the Military Bowl, is one potential starter for 2026. The Pirates could also add depth through the portal this January as they aim to build upon this 9-4 season.",

    "fullText": "Aaron Rodgers threw a go-ahead touchdown pass to Calvin Austin III with 55 seconds left, and the Steelers beat the Ravens 26-24 on Sunday night when Baltimore’s Tyler Loop missed a 44-yard field goal as time expired, giving Pittsburgh the AFC North title.\n\nPittsburgh (10-7) will host Houston (12-5) in the opening round of the playoffs on Monday, Jan. 12, following an electric fourth quarter that saw four lead changes, including three in the final four minutes.\n\nThe Ravens were poised to swing the lead back their way one last time after Lamar Jackson connected with Isaiah Likely for a 28-yard gain that put the Ravens within Loop’s range.\n\nThe rookie’s kick never had a chance, sailing well to the right of the goalposts as the Steelers poured onto the field to celebrate their first division title in five years.\n\nRodgers passed for a season-high 294 yards and his 26-yard toss to Austin made it 26-24. Chris Boswell missed the extra point, giving the Ravens a chance to win with a field goal.\n\nJackson, dealing with a painful back contusion, passed for 238 yards and three scores, including a pair to Zay Flowers in the fourth quarter. Each of Flowers’ TDs — from 50 and 64 yards — put Balti\n\nPittsburgh responded each time, and will now welcome the Texans while looking to end a playoff victory drought that stretches to the 2016 AFC championship game.\n\nPittsburgh’s running back duo of Kenneth Gainwell and Jaylen Warren combined for 173 total yards as the Steelers bounced back from a loss last week in Cleveland and ended a wildly uneven season for Jackson and the Ravens.\n\nThe Steelers trailed by 10 early, and a repeat of the bludgeoning they took at the hands of Balti\n\nThe defense, pushed around repeatedly by Derrick Henry since he joined the Ravens last season, finally responded and the offense — playing without suspended wide receiver DK Metcalf — slowly found its footing.\n\nHenry ran for 126 yards for the Ravens and became the ninth player in NFL history to reach 13,000 career yards rushing but was held mostly in check during a second half that morphed into an improbable shootout.\n\nJackson’s first touchdown pass to Flowers was a thing of beauty. The two-time MVP ducked out of the reach of two would-be tacklers before floating a pass to a streaking Flowers to put the Ravens up 17-13.\n\nGainwell sprinted in from 2 yards out with 3:49 remaining to put Pittsburgh back in front. The Ravens, looking to become the first team since the creation of the AFC North in 2003 to win the division three consecutive years, needed all of three plays to reclaim the lead when Jackson lofted a pass to a wide-open Flowers for a 64-yard score.\n\nRodgers, in what may be the final stretch of his 21-year career, responded by taking the Steelers 65 yards in six plays, the last a rainbow down the left sideline to Austin, who was alone after a Ravens defender fell down.\n\nBoswell then missed his first extra point of the season after 40 straight makes, opening the door for the Ravens. Baltimore appeared poised to end its longtime rival’s season for the second time in 12 months before Loop’s kick started right and stayed there.\n\nThe win was the 193rd regular-season victory of Steelers coach Mike Tomlin’s career, tying him with Hall of Famer Chuck Noll for the franchise record and for ninth on the NFL’s career list.\n\nThe 40th meeting between Tomlin and Ravens coach John Harbaugh — only Hall of Famers George Halas and Curly Lambeau faced each other more — was among the most memorable.\n\nWhether it’s also the last remains to be seen. Harbaugh faces questions about his future after a rocky 18th season.\n\nTomlin, the longest-tenured head coach in major North American professional sports, heads into the postseason with a club that has only occasionally looked like a contender.\n\nThe real test awaits next week.",

In fact, Simone Inzaghi’s side have won their past nine on the bounce in the RSL.\n\nAs it stands, Al Hilal lead the standings for the first time this term. They sit one point clear of Al Nassr after 13 rounds, with third-placed Al Taawoun three points further back.\n\nSpeaking after his team claimed top spot on Sunday, Inzaghi said: “We were good. We played a mature game; we didn't concede anything to a team that didn't lose in six games; they scored 12 times in the last 13 games.\n\n“So it wasn't an easy game, but we approached it well and deservedly won. We are at the top of the table. Thank God we got out of this game without any injuries.”\n\nThe RSL returns on Thursday, when Al Hilal open Matchweek 14 with a home clash against Al Hazem, while Al Nassr play later that night when they welcome a resurgent Al Qadsiah to Al Awwal Park.\n\nAnd, remember, Al Hilal and Al Nassr face off in the Capital Derby in the following round, on January 12.",

Facing 3rd & 1 at the 36 yard line Jackson stood in the pocket and once again found Zay Flowers wide open down field. 64 yards later he was in the endzone putting the Ravens up 24-20 with 2:20 left in the game.\n\nAaron Rodgers showed why he was a four time MVP and with the season on the line he found Calvin Austin open down the sideline for a 26 yard go ahead touchdown with 55 seconds remaining, but Chris Boswell missed the PAT and the Steelers lead was only two points at 26-24.\n\nJackson got the Ravens to midfield, but facing 4th & 7. With the Ravens needing to convert or have their season end Jackson found Isaiah Likely for an improbable 26 yard gain to get into field goal range. That set up Tyler Loop for a 44 yard field goal to win the game and the division, but the kick missed wide right.\n\nAaron Rodgers threw for a season high 294 yards with one touchdown. Kenneth Gainwell led the Steelers in receiving with eight catches for 64 yards. On the defensive side of the ball T.J. Watt returned after missing three games with a punctured lung and recorded an interception that led to a Steelers field goal.\n\nIn the Wild Card round of the playoffs the Steelers will host the Texans on Monday night at 8:15 p.m.",

    "fullText": "The Virginia Tech Hokies had a big recruiting weekend, with the NCAA transfer portal opening on Friday. As expected, commitments followed. First, former Penn State DL Daniel Jennings announced he was transferring to Virginia Tech.\n\nNot long afterward, former Penn State tight end Matt Henderson revealed he was following Jennings to Blacksburg. Like Jennings, it’s a homecoming for Henderson, who is a native of Powhatan, Virginia. Jennings is from Princeton, West Virginia, about an hour away from Blacksburg.\n\nComing HOME @HokiesFB pic.twitter.com/BffZwQaJms\n\n— Matt Henderson (@MattHend2025) January 4, 2026\n\nThe 6-foot-5, 246-pound Henderson played basketball and football in high school, where he was a standout in both sports. After enrolling at Penn State, Henderson was mentored by Ty Howle, Virginia Tech’s new offensive coordinator and tight ends coach. Henderson redshirted in 2025, so he has four years of eligibility remaining with the Hokies.\n\nHenderson was a late riser in the recruiting world. However, once he worked out for Howle and James Franklin, it was over. Henderson began picking up offers, but committed to the Nittany Lions as a junior. Henderson’s addition, with more tight ends potentially on the way, makes it clear that the position will not be ignored in 2026 like it was last season.\n\nHenderson is a big get for Virginia Tech. Not only are the Hokies bringing a talented prospect back home, but Henderson’s best football is ahead of him. He should be an immediate contributor next season.",

He can also earn another $1.5 million if he’s named AP MVP.\n\nConsidering his statistical output this season, it’s extremely unlikely Rodgers will see the $1.5 million tied to an MVP award, but Pittsburgh’s Week 18 win over Baltimore puts him on the doorstep of another massive payday if the Steelers can defeat the Houston Texans on Monday, January 12, at 8:00 p.m. EST.\n\nFor up-to-date Steelers coverage, \n\nThis article originally appeared on Steelers Wire: Steelers' Aaron Rodgers earns $500,000 with win over Ravens",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers swept a weekend back-to-back against the Memphis Grizzlies, capped by Sunday night’s 120-114 win that extended their undefeated mark in clutch games this season.\n\nThe result offered an encouraging sign that LeBron James and Luka Dončić can close games even as the team continues to battle defensive shortcomings.\n\nThe NBA defines clutch time as any situation in which the score is within five points during the final five minutes of the fourth quarter or overtime.\n\nEvery team in the league has dropped at least three clutch-time games this season. The Lakers, however, improved to 12-0, including a 2-0 start to the new year against Memphis.\n\nThe contrast has been stark. In games that never reach clutch time, Los Angeles is just 10-11, and the Lakers have shown a tendency to get blown out, particularly against championship contenders.\n\nWith such a small sample size, it’s difficult to draw sweeping conclusions about what consistently works late in games.\n\n“I don’t know what the updated numbers are,” Lakers head coach JJ Redick said before the Memphis series, according to The Athletic. “Our defense has been really good in the clutch.” Redick is usually critical of the Lakers’ defensive performance this season.\n\nOn Sunday, the offense sealed it. Dončić took control late and finished with 36 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, while James added 26 points, seven rebounds and 10 assists.\n\nThe Lakers will be traveling to New Orleans to take on the Pelicans on Tuesday, a day later they will be in San Antonio to play Victor Wembanyama and the Spurs.",

    "fullText": "AJ Dybantsa has lived up to his billing this season as the potential No. 1 overall selection in the 2026 NBA draft. The BYU 18-year-old freshman — originally from Brockton — is dominating college basketball defenders at the moment.\n\nEarlier in the season, Dybantsa dropped 25 points at Madison Square Garden in front of Jaylen Brown and Derrick White in attendance, and AJ has stockpiled those kinds of scoring performances as the season has gone on.\n\nBleacher Report’s Andy Bailey recently predicted that Dybantsa will indeed be the first pick in the draft, despite competition from two other guys.\n\n“Right now, there are three very real contenders to be the top pick in the 2026 draft: Cameron Boozer, Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa,” Bailey wrote on January 1.\n\n“All three have been incredibly productive as freshmen. And the talent gaps between them (assuming there are any) are small enough that it might come down to which team wins the lottery.”\n\n“If someone needs a bigger forward, Boozer would be the pick,” Bailey continued. “A team in need of a dynamic lead guard could go with Peterson. But Dybantsa checks boxes that both of the others do, and wing is the easiest player archetype to build around. And if Dybantsa keeps playing through conference games the way he has in his last six appearances (when he’s averaged 27.8 points, 8.0 rebounds, 5.7 assists and 2.3 steals), he’ll enter the summer with a ton of momentum.”\n\nPotential No. 1 pick AJ Dybantsa's last 7 games:\n\n24 PTS | 8-15 FG | 8 REB | 3 AST\n33 PTS | 11-13 FG | 10 REB | 10 AST\n35 PTS | 9-12 FG | 6 REB | 4 AST\n23 PTS | 8-14 FG | 10 REB\n26 PTS | 11-17 FG | 8 REB | 7 AST\n28 PTS | 9-17 FG | 9 REB | 6 AST\n22 PTS | 10-15 FG | 5 REB | 5 AST pic.twitter.com/2LkrcwPCqO\n\n— B/R Hoops (@brhoops) January 3, 2026\n\nDybantsa has electrified BYU basketball in his first 14 games played. The 6-foot-8 wing, a preseason AP All-American, joined the Cougars after reclassifying and committing in late 2024.\n\nEarly on in the season, Dybantsa faced challenges, including a narrow 86-84 loss to UConn where he contributed despite team struggles. But he ignited in December. His standout effort came against Clemson on December 9, engineering a 22-point comeback by scoring or assisting on 34 of BYU’s 45 second-half points in a 67-64 victory. He followed with a career-high 35 points versus Abilene Christian and made NCAA history on December 23 against Eastern Washington, posting the youngest-ever 30-point triple-double: 33 points on 11-of-13 shooting, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists.\n\nEntering Big 12 play, Dybantsa earned Lute Olson National Player of the Week on December 15 and Big 12 Player of the Week on December 30. In the conference opener on January 3, he scored 24 points despite seven turnovers, leading No. 10 BYU to an 83-73 road win over Kansas State, extending their streak to 10 victories. Through early January, he’s averaging 23.1 points, 7.2 rebounds, and 3.8 assists on 59.1 percent shooting, positioning BYU as a Final Four contender while solidifying his NBA Draft stock.\n\nLeBron James Retirement Timeline Predicted By Andy Bailey",

    "title": "Terry Francona Makes Feelings Clear on One Reds Player After Disappointing 2025",
    "description": "The Cincinnati Reds need a big 2026 from Matt McClain.",
    "fullText": "The Cincinnati Reds have not had the offseason many fans hoped they would. After showing interest in hometown slugger Kyle Schwarber in MLB free agency, the Reds seemed to be positioning themselves as spenders this winter. Instead, the team missed out on Schwarber, and has done very little to reallocate the money they offered him.\n\nIf they remain unable to make any meaningful additions in free agency, Cincinnati will become even more reliant on internal progression in 2026. No player fits this category better than infielder Matt McLain.\n\nBursting onto the scene in 2023, McLain posted a 127 OPS+ in his rookie season. He missed all of the 2024 campaign due to left shoulder surgery, and returned in 2025 much less productive than his first campaign. With an OPS+ of just 74, McLain was well below league average last season. It was this drop-off in production that had many Reds fans clamoring for a middle-of-the-order addition this winter, incase McLain never returns to his 2023 form.\n\nRoundtable Rundown podcast breaks down the Reds' MLB offseason\n\nChicago White Sox outfielder Luis Robert has been floated as a potential Reds option, but that momentum seems to have cooled in recent weeks. For now, the Reds remain confident that McLain can bounce back.\n\n\"I think it's probably the first time he's ever struggled, anywhere, and to do it at the Major League level is probably a hard place to learn,\" Reds manager Terry Francona said (via MLB.com). \"But he's a very competitive kid.\"\n\nThe veteran manager added, \"In my opinion, he's probably our best baserunner,\" Francona said. \"I don't mean fastest, but I mean he always knows where the ball is. He runs the bases like a veteran. He plays second base, he knows where the ball is supposed to go. The ball jumps off his bat way more than you would think when you look at his stature. I think that shoulder -- you talk to guys that have had that, and they've kind of said the same thing. Like, 'I played, but it wasn't the same.'\"\n\nTo a lesser degree, the Reds also saw star shortstop Elly De La Cruz take a step back in 2025. While he was still an All-Star, his numbers were mostly down across the board from the year prior. If both he and McLain can regain their peak form in 2026, the Reds failing to make a big offseason splash will hurt less. But if that doesn't happen, many will point back to this winter as where things went wrong for Cincinnati.",

    "fullText": "Former Manchester United right back Gary Neville has named the Chelsea player who is a “smidgen away from Eden Hazard.”\n\nBut he’s wrong here, and this is just a very daft comparison in my opinion.\n\nPedro Neto is more like his namesake Pedro, who used to play as a winger at Chelsea, rather than being anything near Eden Hazard’s levels. And after his awful performance against Manchester City last night, comparing him with Hazard cannot be any further from reality.\n\nThe Blues scraped a 1-1 draw away at City last night after Enzo Fernandez bundled in a late equalising goal for the manager-less Chelsea side.\n\nCaptain Reece James was explaining the ‘different plan’ that the team had at the start of the game, as they needed to switch things up at half time to get something from the game.\n\nPedro Neto in action for Chelsea. (Photo by Julian Finney/Getty Images)\n\nGary Neville sometimes gets his opinions spot on. But the majority of the time, I just find myself disagreeing with him.\n\nNeville said on Pedro Neto after the City draw yesterday:\n\n“He bloody frustrated me like you won’t believe. He’s a smidgen away from being an Eden Hazard, but he’s never going to be an Eden Hazard because he hasn’t got that beautiful sort of glide about him. But he was also a killer, and you’ve got to be a killer in those types of positions.”\n\nThat bit was correct, Neto was hugely frustrating yesterday. I think he was breaking down more of our own attacks than the defensive City players were!\n\nHe needs to get much better with his decision making and his quality overall.",

    "fullText": "At the final whistle at the Etihad Stadium yesterday there was an overwhelming sense that Manchester City had thrown away two points against Chelsea. Enzo Fernandez scored for Chelsea in the 94th minute to cancel out Tijjani Reijnders first-half goal to ensure that yesterday’s match finished 1-all. Pep Guardiola’s side ran out of legs as fatigue and injuries caught up to them in the game’s closing stages. City were also left cursing the fact that they couldn’t convert a plethora of good positions into goals or chances. As the final whistle blew there was also another factor that stood out. This Manchester City side is still learning and they have a way to go to become a fully-fledged Pep Guardiola side.\n\nIn years gone by, Manchester City would easily control the closing stages of a match like last night’s. Pep Guardiola’s all-conquering City side would not let their opponents have possession and they’d typically see out the closing stages of matches like last night’s with ease. But that didn’t occur at the Etihad against Chelsea last night. Instead, Pep Guardiola’s side ran out of legs. Injuries and fatigue caught up to City. With tired legs and tired minds, the decision-making of this City side wilted.\n\nManchester City couldn’t control the final stages of last night’s match. They left the door open for Chelsea to nick a point. Instead of closing the game down and controlling possession, City kept trying to do much on the ball or defensively rather than doing the simple things. In truth, City should have two or three goals up by the time Enzo Fernandez equalised for Chelsea. But they weren’t. Pep Guardiola’s side should have kept possession, but they were unable to do so late on last night. There was an immaturity to Manchester City’s play late in yesterday’s match. That immaturity cost City dearly.\n\nThe passage of play that led to Chelsea’s equaliser showed the immaturity in Pep Guardiola’s side. Rayan Cherki picked up possession on the right wing and played a chip to Bernardo Silva. Manchester City’s captain lost possession while trying to keep the ball. Chelsea midfielder Andrey Santos took the ball from Bernardo and attempted to surge forward from midfield. Bernardo pulled down Andrey Santos and picked up a yellow card. Chelsea worked the ball from the free kick out wide to Malo Gusto. Nico O’Reilly stepped up to challenge to high up the pitch at on Chelsea’s right wing. Gusto rounded O’Reilly and set up Enzo Fernandez’s late equaliser.\n\nThose two pieces of play from Cherki and O’Reilly highlighted the immaturity in City’s play. They’ll both learn from what occurred last night as will this new-look Manchester City side. It was a harsh lesson for them to learn but one that should serve this City side well in time.\n\nThe way Manchester City conceded the late equaliser to Chelsea doesn’t fall solely on Rayan Cherki and Nico O’Reilly. It is a lesson this City side must learn together. Under Pep Guardiola you do think they will. There were mitigating factors at play in the game’s closing stages last night. The City players were tired and Rodri had run out of steam. The loss of Ruben Dias and Josko Gvardiol also hurt Pep Guardiola’s team. But there was enough leadership and experience on the pitch to prevent what occurred late in yesterday’s match from happening. But it wasn’t to be.\n\nSpeaking after Manchester City’s draw with Chelsea, Rodri explained that his team must learn from yesterday’s disappointing draw to Chelsea. Speaking on what occurred, Rodri said: “It’s frustrating of course but at the end it is what it is. We created enough chances to win the game three or four-nil, but this is football. If you don’t take your chances with nothing they just draw the game.”\n\n“So we have to learn from this. There is still a long way and we just need to focus on the next games. First half was brilliant, enough to score three or four goals. In the second half, we forgot a little bit how to play and they got control of the game, losing easy balls.”\n\n“Sometimes when you defend, defend, defend, they did not have much but they get a draw. There’s still a long way to go.”\n\n“Injuries unbalances the team, every single time a player goes out [injured] but of course, the team has to adjust. It is not an excuse, we have enough talented players to play but in the second half we lose face a bit.”\n\nManchester City should have beaten Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium last night. But they failed to take full advantage of their openings and they couldn’t sustain control of last night’s match as the second-half wore on. There is a lesson to be learned from last night’s result for this City side and come the final whistle it was apparent that this iteration of Pep Guardiola’s side still has a lot to learn. That process is ongoing and it will take time as we saw last night when Manchester City couldn’t gain control of last night’s match when they desperately needed to.",

    "description": "“If you haven’t yet made the trip to Hetton this season, now is the perfect time!”",
    "fullText": "Before we dive in, it’s worth saying clearly that this article hasn’t been written to push an agenda, to guilt-trip anyone or to suggest that “real” supporters must attend women’s football, as Sunderland AFC is a broad, passionate community, and people support the club in many different ways.\n\nThis guide simply exists to help those who might be interested — whether you’re a lifelong fan, a curious groundhopper, someone looking for an affordable family day out or a supporter who follows the men’s team and wants to explore another part of the club. It’s an invitation, not an obligation, and a celebration of another vibrant corner of the Sunderland football family.\n\nWomen’s football has grown enormously in recent years, but it remains a space where new supporters are welcomed with open arms, so if you’ve ever wondered what a matchday is like, how to get to Eppleton or what the atmosphere feels like, this guide is here to help.\n\nThe Lasses deserve recognition for the commitment, talent, and spirit they bring to the pitch, and it’s always lovely to see all aspects of Sunderland AFC being supported — but only ever in ways that feel right for each individual. If this article helps even one person discover a new matchday experience they enjoy, it’s done its job.\n\nIt’s also important to acknowledge that the 2025/2026 season hasn’t been straightforward. It’s been turbulent, challenging, and at times frustrating — the kind of campaign where results haven’t always reflected the effort on the pitch.\n\nYet there’s something undeniably special about being present during seasons like this.\n\nYou feel part of the graft, the rebuilding process and the determination to turn things around. There’s cautious optimism growing among supporters; a sense that despite the difficulties, the foundations for a stronger second half of the season are in place. Being witness to that journey, from the lows, the resilience and the potential upswing is its own unique experience, and one that many fans cherish.\n\nThe matchday experience at Eppleton Colliery Welfare Ground has become a cherished part of the club’s identity, and the atmosphere surrounding the team reflects the pride, passion, and community spirit that Sunderland supporters are known for.\n\nEppleton, located in Hetton-le-Hole, has been the home of the Lasses for several seasons now, and it remains one of the most welcoming and intimate grounds in the women’s game. Even in a difficult season, attendances have held firm, with families, young fans, and longstanding supporters all coming together to cheer on a team that embodies the region’s footballing heritage.\n\nThis season has been a test of character.\n\nSunderland Women have faced injuries, frustrating defeats and moments where momentum slipped away just as it seemed to be building. Yet through all of this, the squad has shown resilience and flashes of real quality in their last two competitive games, and a 4-0 win away to Sheffield United at the start of the season showed what the Lasses can achieve when they play expansive attacking football.\n\nThe blend of experienced players and emerging young talent remains one of the team’s strengths, and even in tough matches, there have been performances that hint at what the side is capable of when everything clicks.\n\nHome form has been mixed, but Eppleton continues to be a place where the Lasses dig deep. The tight pitch and vocal support create an atmosphere that can unsettle visiting teams — and several matches have showcased the grit and determination that supporters know this squad possesses.\n\nWhilst the first half of the season has been difficult, there’s a growing sense of belief that the second half could bring a resurgence — the kind of turnaround that makes following football so compelling.\n\nEppleton Colliery Welfare Ground is a quintessential North East football venue: compact, characterful, and deeply rooted in the community.\n\nIt offers an intimate matchday experience where supporters are close to the action and where the connection between players and fans feels genuine and immediate. The ground has a capacity of around 2,500, including a 250-seat covered stand that provides shelter and a traditional vantage point for those who prefer to sit.\n\nStanding areas wrap around the pitch, giving supporters the freedom to choose their preferred spot. Many regulars enjoy standing along the railings, where the proximity to the pitch allows them to feel every tackle, cheer every goal and share in the emotion of the match.\n\nFacilities include a matchday café, well-managed turnstiles, and parking around the ground — though arriving early is wise for busier fixtures.\n\nEppleton is well-connected, making it easy for supporters across the region to attend.\n\nFrom Sunderland, regular bus services run from the interchange to Hetton, with stops just a short walk from the ground. The journey typically takes twenty-five to thirty-five minutes, and on matchdays you’ll often find yourself travelling alongside other supporters, adding to the sense of community before you even arrive.\n\nFrom Durham, buses also run directly to Hetton, with journey times of around thirty to forty minutes. Many students and families use this route, making it a popular option.\n\nFor those driving, the A690 provides a straightforward route, with clear signage leading into Hetton. Parking is available near the ground, though spaces can be limited during high-attendance matches.\n\nTickets for Sunderland AFC Women continue to offer some of the best value in the women’s game.\n\nPrices for the 2025/2026 season are intentionally affordable, ensuring that matchdays remain accessible for families, students, and supporters of all ages. Tickets can be purchased online through the club’s official website, with options for digital tickets or collection at the ground. Adult tickets are priced at £10; over 65’s £8 and under 22’s £6.\n\nIt should be worth adding that if you’re interested in a season ticket, the Lasses have always offered incredibly affordable football, with “early bird” season tickets priced at £50 for adults, £40 for concessions (over 65s) and £20 for under-14s and students, offering fantastic value for fans.\n\nBuying in advance is recommended for busier fixtures, but tickets are also available at the turnstiles on the day. Entry is smooth and well-organised, with friendly staff and volunteers helping to create a welcoming matchday atmosphere.\n\nSunderland Women typically play their home matches on Sundays at 2pm.\n\nThis regular slot offers familiarity for supporters and makes attending matches easy to plan around. The Sunday afternoon timing is particularly family-friendly, contributing to the relaxed and inclusive feel of matchdays at Eppleton.\n\nOccasionally, fixtures may be moved for broadcast or cup commitments, but the club communicates any changes clearly through its official channels.\n\nThe 2025/2026 season has brought a major boost to accessibility.\n\nEvery WSL2 match is now streamed live and free on the WSL2 YouTube channel. This means supporters can follow the Lasses from anywhere in the world. Highlights are uploaded later for those who miss the live broadcast.\n\nFor fans who prefer text updates, the Sunderland AFC Women’s Twitter account provides live play-by-play commentary during every match — a great option if you’re on the move or unable to watch the stream.\n\nOf course, nothing compares to being there in person, as the energy, the closeness to the action, and the sense of belonging are unmatched.\n\nAttending a Sunderland Women’s match is more than just watching football: it’s a community experience where supporters of all ages come together. The atmosphere is friendly, inclusive, and full of passion, and whether you choose to sit in the stand or stand along the railings, you’ll have an excellent view of the pitch.\n\nThe café provides refreshments throughout the match, offering hot drinks and snacks that feel just right on a cool North East afternoon. Volunteers and staff contribute to the warm, community-driven feel that makes Eppleton special.\n\nOne of the most cherished traditions is the post-match interaction between players and supporters. Regardless of the result, the players always come over to sign autographs, take photos, and chat.\n\nThis connection is one of the defining features of the women’s game and a highlight for many fans — especially younger supporters.\n\nTo stay connected with the team, here are the key accounts and supporter groups!\n\nSunderland AFC Women (Instagram)\n\nSunderland AFC Women (Facebook)\n\nSunderland AFC Women Supporters Group (Twitter)\n\nSunderland AFC Women Supporters Group (Instagram)\n\nSunderland AFC Women Supporters Group (Facebook)\n\nThe 2025/2026 season may have been turbulent so far, but that’s part of what makes this moment so compelling.\n\nSupporting a team through difficult spells creates a deeper connection, as you feel part of the journey, the effort and the determination to improve. And when the tide turns — as many supporters believe it can in the second half of the season —being able to say you were there through it all is something special.\n\nThe matchday experience at Eppleton is warm, welcoming and deeply rooted in the community.\n\nThe affordability of tickets, quality of football and family-friendly atmosphere make it an ideal outing for supporters of all kinds, and whether you’re a lifelong fan or someone considering attending your first match, you’ll find something meaningful at Eppleton.\n\nIf you haven’t yet made the trip to Hetton this season, now is the perfect time. The Lasses are fighting; the atmosphere is electric at times, and the community is ready to welcome you. There’s nothing quite like being part of it!",

    "description": "Our writers react to the Lads’ 1-1 draw with Spurs, as Brian Brobbey’s equaliser proved vital!",
    "fullText": "I think Brian Brobbey has been really good recently and the goal he scored against Spurs was probably the best we’ve scored all season, although you have to give credit to Omar Alderete, Nordi Mukiele, Granit Xhaka and in particular Enzo Le Fée for their part in it, too.\n\nIt was a superb team effort and the way he lashed it home was fantastic — he absolutely wellied it into the net.\n\nHopefully this is the start of a purple patch for the big man, who looks a real threat up top and is showing why we paid so much money for him.\n\nWe were naff in the first half — more on that later — but we responded really well after half time and I don’t think there can be any denying that we deserved to get back into the game.\n\nWe really improved after the break and the Lads came out and really gave it their all; in fact, I think in the end Spurs could probably count themselves as lucky to have escaped with only a point.\n\nIt felt like one of those games where if it had gone on another ten minutes we’d have probably got a second goal, but alas, we take the point and move on — and considering how decent Spurs were in the opening forty five, it was probably a fair result.\n\nI think you could see particularly in the first half that the lads were a little fatigued from a gruelling runout against Manchester City a few days ago, but that was no excuse for just how bad our passing was in the opening half of the game.\n\nThe amount of times we conceded possession was ridiculous and so unlike us.\n\nThankfully, we fixed it in the second period and Spurs never took advantage, but we have to be careful that we aren’t that bad against Brentford as they’re confident and would surely take advantage of such massive lapses in concentration.\n\nI don’t think the shape we started the game with was working and whilst Régis Le Bris eventually sorted it out, we could’ve been put to bed in that first half if Spurs had been better, so we probably should’ve changed things up sooner.\n\nScored a brilliantly taken equaliser to top off an excellent second half performance.\n\nAfter a quiet first half he battled for the second forty five minutes, was everywhere across the pitch and his willingness to track back was tremendous.\n\nThe likes of Rodrigo Bentancur, Cristian Romero and Pedro Porro will be glad they don’t have to deal with him every week, as even their typical shithousery failed with our big striker coming out on top.\n\nHow Le Fée keeps running is beyond me.\n\nI thought Sadiki was our “energiser bunny” in the middle of the park but even after a breathless game against Manchester City, Le Fée still clocked up the miles and his second half showing was as if he’d had a week to recover. Unlucky to not score with a brilliant run and deft header, but his first-time ball to assist Brobbey was excellent.\n\nAs for Geertruida, I love this lad.\n\nAs an opposition manager, you don’t know how to deal with him as he plays everywhere — although the more I watch, I love him in the middle of the park.\n\nHis reading of the game was superb; he has such a great understanding with Granit Xhaka and Le Fée that it may mean when AFCON finishes, Habib Diarra and Sadiki won’t just walk back into the starting eleven.\n\nThe fight he showed when getting at Bentancur was great to see as well. Can we sign him permanently, please?\n\nCountless times in the first half, we were nearly the victim of our own downfall by needlessly and aimlessly giving the ball away through misdirected passes or being too casual when trying to get the ball forward.\n\nLuckily, Spurs didn’t know what to do with it either so we only went in 1-0 down at half time.\n\nThis was the Adingra we saw at the start of the season, sadly.\n\nJust when you thought he’d turned a corner, his performance was as poor as we’ve seen from him in a Sunderland shirt — and it didn’t help that his immediate replacement in Mundle didn’t offer much more, either.\n\nI feel like Mundle lacks the awareness to the pace the league requires to be successful, as he’s often caught on the ball or closed down before he can move it off to another player.\n\nHe definitely hasn’t found the rhythm when trying to beat his man, so maybe a start against Everton in the FA Cup could help with this?\n\nI feared the worst after the first half performance as we looked leggy and unmotivated, but the Lads turned it around in brilliant fashion in a much rejuvenated second half display.\n\nWe’ve played four games so far during this AFCON- affected period — all resulting in well-fought draws — and this was no exception.\n\nA great fightback from the brink to take something back to Wearside\n\nHe had a tough first half with not much to work with, but my word — did he take his chance when it came.\n\nA brilliant passing move all the way from Omar Alderete, set up beautifully by Enzo Le Fée with the one-two and finished with thunderous volley into the top corner.\n\nNo chance for their goalkeeper (or any goalkeeper for that matter). and it also seemed to really motivate Brobbey, who stepped his performance up a gear after the goal.\n\nTheir goal was poor and epitomised our first half perfromance.\n\nThere shouldn’t be a man left totally unmarked at the back post and he shouldn’t be able to take a touch and pick a pass. We should’ve been faster to react, to press the ball and block the shot, but we weren’t, and it was very frustrating to see.\n\nMundle was really poor off the bench.\n\nI really like him and clearly Régis Le Bris does too, but he’s done next to nothing with the opportunities that he’s been given. He’s a very talented player and I have faith that eventually it’ll click into place, but if you’re going to be the first substitute, coming on, you’re expected to make more of an impact.\n\nI understand that it’s easier said than done to come on against a Champions League team whilst everyone else has settled into the game, but I’d still like to see more from him — and all the substitutes.\n\nHe came on at 1-0, and it would be easy to be confused at bringing on a defender when we were trying to push forward, but the change in shape and Ballard’s threat up front was a bold move and it turned the game.\n\nAnother great battling performance from the stocky frontman.\n\nHe deserved his goal, and what a blast it was! Spurs were there for the taking and but for a non-existent first half show, we could’ve bagged three points.\n\nBut another point won, and a full ninety and a goal for Brobbey.\n\nThe Lads lacked energy and vigour — you could say that was predictable after the showing against Manchester City — but consistency of levels and performances are key for a good team and we lack consistency at the moment.\n\nThe energy picked up in the second half, but we didn’t show up early on.\n\nThe passing was also missing for large parts of the game and it was almost like watching a team of strangers at times.\n\nMiscommunication, sloppy passes and not on the same page as each other. Very strange and very unusual but thankfully, we woke up to warm everyone up.\n\nI’m now at  the point where if we are in the game at half time we will get something  out of it because Regis is so tactically aware we are a different side in the  second half. He did an amazing job to sort the team out for the final 45 minutes.\n\nSo good to see Dan back on the pitch. He is so important to this side.\n\nSo disappointed with our winger.\n\nHe and Brian Brobbey were Sunderland’s “out ball” today and it was so frustrating as he didn’t show up in the first half.\n\nThe home crowd, a huge stadium…and they were awful.\n\nI was in the home end and they were silent.\n\nHowever dire your team is, you need to get behind them. They turned away minutes into the game and it just shows what we deliver week after week.\n\nAfter a difficult first half, we came out with renewed vigour in the second half and were the better team thereafter.\n\nNot only did we defend doggedly as a team, we got forward and could easily have won the game.\n\nWe were very inventive going forward after the break.\n\nBrian Brobbey had arguably his best game for Sunderland — not only scoring a superb goal but holding the ball up and bringing others into play. He’s looking fitter with every game and did his fair share of pressing and defending too.\n\nGranit Xhaka dictated our play, Enzo Le Fée came to life and both Trai Hume and Nordi Mukiele got forward to support the attack.\n\nIn the first, half we looked leggy — which was understandable — but Régis Le Bris wasn’t frightened to make changes to make us more of a threat and take pressure off our defence.\n\nDan Ballard’s introduction enabled Lutsharel Geertruida to move into midfield, while Spurs could never settle with Romaine Mundle on the left, Simon Adingra switching to the right and Mukiele getting forward from right back.\n\nWe were possibly running on empty after Manchester City but after a slow start, our adrenaline and “til the end” mentality saw us through once again.\n\nI think fatigue could well be an issue but with few options for rotation, the Lads are really putting in a shift to see us through until the African players return.\n\nDuring the second half, everyone stepped up and Spurs knew they were in a game.\n\nWe were very competitive in midfield and defence, and our attack came to dynamic life in the final thirty minutes of the game. For once we were ahead in the overall possession stats., and we could easily have left this impressive stadium with all three points.\n\nThe players stayed after the whistle to celebrate with the travelling fans. long after the home team had disappeared down the tunnel.\n\nIf anyone needed convincing about Brobbey, this was the input over ninety-plus minutes that any doubters needed. It was a sensational performance from our number nine which showed that he’s reached full fitness and has bought into the current Sunderland ethos.\n\nHe showed massive awareness and was a constant pest to the home defence. The goal itself — a one-two with Enzo Le Fée followed by a powerful finish into the top corner — was a thing of beauty.\n\nThere was a low-key feel to the first half.\n\nSpurs were a bit hesitant given their poor home record, and we started slowly — did we really show up? This wasn’t surprising given how draining the last couple of home games have been, given AFCON and other absences.\n\nIn the second half, we shook off our shackles and came forward very effectively.\n\nIt’s fine saying that we are unbeaten in the last 5 games, with one defeat in eight, but the truth is that we’ve only won twogames since Stamford Bridge in October.\n\nWe need a couple of wins to lift us back into European qualification.\n\nIn some ways I can’t believe I’m. writing this as we still need to reach forty points, but Sunderland’s performances have raised the expectations of all fans.\n\nIt was a great build up, with Enzo Le Fée showing a great touch to play the ball into Brobbey’s path — and the finish itself was emphatic.\n\nAt that stage it was nothing less than we deserved and it was a timely contribution from Brobbey himself, who’s been playing well enough in recent weeks but with little reward and now finding Eliezer Mayenda breathing down his neck for the centre forward role.\n\nAs the second half wore on and with Sunderland still a goal down despite taking control of the game, you had to wonder if it was going to be one of those days where it just wasn’t going to go our way.\n\nHowever, this is a Sunderland team that all the pundits like to emphasise has plenty of spirit and togetherness while also not waking up at this point going into the New Year to what all us fans know — we have quality in there too.\n\nIt was quality that crafted our equaliser and you cant go to a place like Tottenham and look the more likely winner without having something more than grit and huff and puff.\n\nIt was worrying to face the possibility that Dan Ballard could’ve faced a lengthy spell out injured as he’s made himself a key player for us this season.\n\nSeeing him back on the pitch in the second half was good news and with Ballard hopefully returning to our starting eleven, it’ll give us more options, with either a five at the back or someone else to move forward.\n\nEither way, our defence looks more solid with him in the middle.\n\nI can’t really moan as this was our second game in a few days, but Tottenham looked like they had an extra yard on us in the first half and deserved to be leading at the break.\n\nThat said, it’s over ninety minutes and not forty five, so maybe “the entitled” down at White Hart Lane need to look at their own game plan after they came flying out of the blocks in the first half.\n\nWe looked the more likely winners by the time the full time whistle had gone.",

The loss is Illinois’ worst in the NET rankings this season.\n\nThe win over the Illini (15-8, 7-6 Big Ten) is the first victory over a ranked opponents for the Scarlet Knights (12-11, 5-7 Big Ten) this season.\n\nIf you tuned in midway through the second half, you might have trouble believing that Illinois was being steamrolled early to start this game.\n\nThe game began slow for Illinois.

Harper was coming off of a high ankle sprain that had sidelined him from Rutgers’ last two games.\n\nPaired with him was his red-hot running mate Ace Bailey, who had ten points in the first ten minutes to create a huge early advantage for the hosts.\n\nIn a game where Kasparas Jakucionis continued to struggle on the offensive end, Will Riley took over the reigns for a second straight game, scoring a team-high 20 points. 13 of those points came in the second half, where Illinois worked its way back to seize the lead after trailing by as many as 17.\n\nOnce the Illini did start to get back into the game, it came thanks to the Scarlet Knights hitting a brick wall themselves. A three-minute stretch in the mid-to-late first half saw the hosts go 1-for-8 on field goals, which gave Illinois a 48-47 lead, its first advantage since leading 2-0 to open the evening.",

    "fullText": "Liam Rosenior is as good a coach as Wayne Rooney has worked with and deserves the chance to be Chelsea manager - with the former England striker fondly remembering their time together at Derby County.\n\nStrasbourg boss Rosenior is the leading candidate to become the new boss at Chelsea, who have the same owners as the French club.\n\nEnglishman Rosenior, 41, was Rooney's assistant boss at Derby in 2021 and 2022, and he became the interim Rams boss in League One after the Manchester United legend's departure.\n\nHe then managed Hull City before being sacked, despite just missing out on the Championship play-offs, moving to Strasbourg in 2024.\n\n\"He's taken chances, and hopefully that pays off because I think Liam is as good a coach as I've ever worked with,\" Rooney said on the BBC's Wayne Rooney Show.\n\n\"His detail, how he approaches the day-to-day, he's as good as I've worked with.\"\n\nRooney has managed DC United, Birmingham City and Plymouth Argyle since leaving Derby and now works in the media, including his BBC podcast.\n\n\"Liam was so important for me,\" said Rooney. \"He was incredible in his coaching ability. I was more of the manager and dealing with players and everything.\n\n\"So I learned a lot from him from that point of view and then I think he's done a great job as a whole.\"\n\nAmorim’s strange comments & Rosenior will be great at Chelsea! - listen to Wayne Rooney podcast\n\n'Good idea' or taking 'massive chance' - is Rosenior ready for Chelsea?\n\nRooney said he has \"no doubts\" that Rosenior could do a good job for Chelsea.\n\nEnzo Maresca left his role at the Blues after 18 months in charge, having fallen out with the club's owners.\n\nThe last time Rosenior worked in the Premier League was as a player for Brighton in 2017.\n\nAs a right-back, he had a solid but unspectacular career as a player - also featuring in the top flight for Fulham, Reading and Hull.\n\nRoughly half his career was spent in the EFL and that is where he started his coaching career.\n\nAfter a spell as Brighton's under-23s coach, he spent three years at Derby - working with Phillip Cocu before Rooney.\n\n\"He's also got a side which you don't want to cross him as well,\" said Rooney.\n\n\"That's important as well. If he goes in there, he won't disappoint. He's been waiting for an opportunity like this.\n\n\"If you don't take it now, then you're never going to take it. And I think he's done his apprenticeship, he's done his work to try and get to that job.\n\n\"So he'll have no doubts in his mind that he's capable of doing that job. And hopefully, very soon, hopefully we hear that he is the manager, because for young English coaches I think it's massive.\n\n\"We don't really see English managers at big clubs. So he'd be leading the way for for us.\"\n\nThe only English managers currently in the Premier League are Newcastle's Eddie Howe, Burnley's Scott Parker and Nottingham Forest's Sean Dyche.\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "While the Commanders were playing on Sunday, another team signed its star LT to a big contract. Laremy Tunsil was paying attention.",
    "fullText": "The Washington Commanders completed their regular season Sunday, defeating the Philadelphia Eagles 24-17 to finish the season 5-12. Several starters missed Sunday's game for the Commanders, including five-time Pro Bowl left tackle Laremy Tunsil.\n\nDuring Sunday's game, Ian Rapoport of the NFL Network broke some news: the Seattle Seahawks, who clinched the NFC West and NFC's No. 1 overall seed on Saturday night, had agreed to a four-year extension with left tackle Charles Cross. The numbers: 4 years, $104.4 million — $26.1 million average per year, with $40.5 million due to Cross in year one of the deal. Rapoport also said that Cross would receive $75 million in guaranteed money.\n\nTunsil was paying attention and shared the following message on his Instagram.\n\nLet's the games begin! #Commanders LT Laremy Tunsil latest IG post! #RaiseCheckbook pic.twitter.com/xGzi6rH31m\n\n— Deuce_Redzone (@redzoneinthelab) January 5, 2026\n\nNot only did Tunsil share the news on Instagram, but he also reposted Rapoport's message on X.\n\nThis is notable because Tunsil has one year remaining on his contract and has made it clear he wants a new deal.\n\n\"Whatever happens, happens,” Tunsil told Tashan Reed of The Washington Post last month. \"Of course, I want to be paid. Of course, I want to stay with this organization.......When we get to the offseason, we can handle it.\"\n\nTunsil has earned a new contract. When the Commanders acquired him in March from the Houston Texans, he had two years remaining on a contract extension he signed in 2023. However, there were no guarantees remaining.\n\nTunsil started the first 14 games of the season for Washington, and he was outstanding. Coaches and teammates praised him for his leadership and on-field play. Offensive coordinator Kliff Kingsbury said he was surprised at how good a run blocker Tunsil was. Tunsil also served as a mentor for first-round tackle Josh Conerly Jr.\n\nHowever, an oblique injury in Week 15 led the Commanders to sideline him for the remainder of the season.\n\nTunsil's intentions are clear: he wants to be paid. The good news is that Washington has plenty of cap space and a young quarterback to protect. Tunsil is in a unique position, having already signed two extensions since entering the NFL back in 2016. He's reset the market twice. It's easy to forget that Tunsil is still only 31 and plans to keep playing, much like former Washington tackle Trent Williams.\n\nHow much will Tunsil receive? Cross is 25, so Washington may not want to pay Tunsil a similar amount. However, Tunsil reposting those messages makes it clear: negotiations will begin at Cross's numbers.\n\nThe Commanders want to keep Tunsil, and he wants to stay. Both sides should be motivated enough to get this done and not allow it to linger into the season as it did with Terry McLaurin in 2025.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Commanders Wire: Washington Commanders: Laremy Tunsil looking to get paid again",

    "fullText": "A Dublin man is leading the construction of the world's largest ever telescope. The Extremely Large Telescope (ELT) is approximately 70% built in the Andes Mountains in Chile.\n\nProfessor Tom Ray is president of the European Southern Observatory (ESO), which is building the telescope.\n\n\"We're talking about a mirror, right, that is 40 metres across,\" he explained on RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"The dome is the size of the Colosseum in Rome, but actually taller than the Colosseum, but roughly about the same width.\"\n\nThe ELT is due to be completed in 2028 and is expected to cost €1.5 billion.\n\n\"It is enormous compared to anything, any sort of telescope that's been built in the past,\" he said.\n\n\"And with it, it would be possible, for example, to not only image Earth-sized planets around nearby stars, but also to explore their atmosphere.\n\n\"We want to see if there's any signs of life on the planet or whether there's any oxygen, the things that would give rise to life.\"\n\nIreland has been a member of ESO since 2019, Prof Ray said there is a lot of Irish input into the ELT project.\n\n\"The University of Galway, for example, is involved in building what we call an adoptive optics,\" he explained this as using lasers to sharpen the images of stars as seen by telescopes.\n\nIreland becoming more prominent in space exploration\n\nSenior Irish scientists say Ireland is becoming more prominent in space exploration, creating more jobs and opportunities.\n\nIn 2025, Ireland successfully completed its first satellite mission in space.\n\nBelfast-born astronaut Dr Rosemary Coogan became a European Space Agency (ESA) astronaut this year, through UK government funding.\n\nNorah Patten is expected to go into space on a commercial flight in 2027.\n\nIn March 2025, Ireland joined CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research.\n\nAnd scientists in Galway will be among the first to use the ELT when it goes live.\n\nThe scientists are studying a project on exoplanets with Italian scientists, and earlier this year, found the planet WISPIT 2b. It is about 430 light-years away from Earth.\n\nEIRSAT-1: Ireland's first satellite\n\nEIRSAT-1 was launched in January 2023 and burned back into the Earth's atmosphere after successfully completing its mission in September 2025.\n\nProfessor of astronomy, Lorraine Hanlon, director of UCD's Centre for Space Research, led the EIRSAT-1 mission.\n\n\"All of the technology that we created really from our lab to a fully functioning space instrument has been tested,\" Prof Hanlon told RTÉ's This Week.\n\n\"Showing that that technology worked, that we were able to put it together and put a full spacecraft together in our labs tells us that we can actually use this technology not only for small satellites, but we can use it as building blocks for much larger instruments that would be even more powerful in the future.\"\n\nDuring the mission, Prof Hanlon's team in UCD detected 12 gamma-ray bursts as well as several solar flares using the EIRSAT-1.\n\nWe need your consent to load this rte-player contentWe use rte-player to manage extra content that can set cookies on your device and collect data about your activity.

There are at least 116 Irish companies that have a contract with ESA.\n\nMany Irish companies and higher education institutions now have work from membership of organisations such as ESA, ESO and CERN.\n\nProf Hanlon said joining these organisations is worth the membership fees.\n\n\"It means that your scientists are in those collaborations, are defining the experiments that will create the next level of challenge.\n\n\"So, your scientists are defining those problems that need to be addressed.\"\n\nMunster Technological University has already joined a scientific experiment with CERN.\n\nThe ESA is launching the PLATO mission to search for planets around other stars this year, which will include technology from Irish company Réaltra.\n\nAnother Irish company, InnaLabs, has its technology on board another ESA mission called HERA, which will arrive at the Didymos asteroid system in late 2026.\n\nIn UCD, another satellite mission called GIFTS: A 6U CubeSat for the detection and localisation of gamma-ray bursts is currently underway.\n\nAerial, a project with funding from both ESA and ESO, also has Irish involvement.\n\nProf Ray explained: \"What Aerial is doing is looking at a few thousand planets and their atmosphere, but from space.\n\n\"So, we're involved with the constructing of several parts of this and testing them, because they have to be tested at very low temperatures, I'm talking minus 230C because that's what it's like out in space.\"\n\nProf Ray added that Irish scientists are doing \"very innovative work in space\".\n\n\"Our students, our postdocs, people who already have a PhD, are receiving wonderful training from work not only to do with the European Space Agency, but the European Southern Observatory.\n\n\"I've had 30 PhD students and none of them are unemployed. They are immediately snapped up,\" he said.",

    "description": "Tech companies looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly being voted down",
    "fullText": "SPRING CITY, Pa. — Tech companies and developers looking to plunge billions of dollars into ever-bigger data centers to power artificial intelligence and cloud computing are increasingly losing fights in communities where people don’t want to live next to them, or even near them.\n\nCommunities across the United States are reading about — and learning from — each other's battles against data center proposals that are fast multiplying in number and size to meet steep demand as developers branch out in search of faster connections to power sources.\n\nIn many cases, municipal boards are trying to figure out whether energy- and water-hungry data centers fit into their zoning framework. Some have entertained waivers or tried to write new ordinances. Some don’t have zoning.\n\nBut as more people hear about a data center coming to their community, once-sleepy municipal board meetings in farming towns and growing suburbs now feature crowded rooms of angry residents pressuring local officials to reject the requests.\n\n“Would you want this built in your backyard?” Larry Shank asked supervisors last month in Pennsylvania's East Vincent Township. “Because that’s where it’s literally going, is in my backyard.”\n\nA growing number of proposals are going down in defeat, sounding alarms across the data center constellation of Big Tech firms, real estate developers, electric utilities, labor unions and more.\n\nAndy Cvengros, who helps lead the data center practice at commercial real estate giant JLL, counted seven or eight deals he’d worked on in recent months that saw opponents going door-to-door, handing out shirts or putting signs in people’s yards.\n\n“It’s becoming a huge problem,” Cvengros said.\n\nData Center Watch, a project of 10a Labs, an AI security consultancy, said it is seeing a sharp escalation in community, political and regulatory disruptions to data center development.\n\nBetween April and June alone, its latest reporting period, it counted 20 proposals valued at $98 billion in 11 states that were blocked or delayed amid local opposition and state-level pushback. That amounts to two-thirds of the projects it was tracking.\n\nSome environmental and consumer advocacy groups say they’re fielding calls every day, and are working to educate communities on how to protect themselves.\n\n“I’ve been doing this work for 16 years, worked on hundreds of campaigns I’d guess, and this by far is the biggest kind of local pushback I’ve ever seen here in Indiana,” said Bryce Gustafson of the Indianapolis-based Citizens Action Coalition.\n\nIn Indiana alone, Gustafson counted more than a dozen projects that lost rezoning petitions.\n\nFor some people angry over steep increases in electric bills, their patience is thin for data centers that could bring still-higher increases.\n\nLosing open space, farmland, forest or rural character is a big concern. So is the damage to quality of life, property values or health by on-site diesel generators kicking on or the constant hum of servers. Others worry that wells and aquifers could run dry.\n\nLawsuits are flying — both ways — over whether local governments violated their own rules.\n\nBig Tech firms Microsoft, Google, Amazon and Facebook — which are collectively spending hundreds of billions of dollars on data centers across the globe — didn’t answer Associated Press questions about the effect of community pushback.\n\nMicrosoft, however, has acknowledged the difficulties. In an October securities filing, it listed its operational risks as including “community opposition, local moratoriums, and hyper-local dissent that may impede or delay infrastructure development.”\n\nEven with high-level support from state and federal governments, the pushback is having an impact.\n\nMaxx Kossof, vice president of investment at Chicago-based developer The Missner Group, said developers worried about losing a zoning fight are considering selling properties once they secure a power source — a highly sought-after commodity that makes a proposal far more viable and valuable.\n\n“You might as well take chips off the table,” Kossof said. “The thing is you could have power to a site and it’s futile because you might not get the zoning. You might not get the community support.”\n\nSome in the industry are frustrated, saying opponents are spreading falsehoods about data centers — such as polluting water and air — and are difficult to overcome.\n\nStill, data center allies say they are urging developers to engage with the public earlier in the process, emphasize economic benefits, sow good will by supporting community initiatives and talk up efforts to conserve water and power and protect ratepayers.\n\n“It's definitely a discussion that the industry is having internally about, ‘Hey, how do we do a better job of community engagement?’” said Dan Diorio of the Data Center Coalition, a trade association that includes Big Tech firms and developers.\n\nWinning over local officials, however, hasn't translated to winning over residents.\n\nDevelopers pulled a project off an October agenda in the Charlotte suburb of Matthews, North Carolina, after Mayor John Higdon said he informed them it faced unanimous defeat.\n\nThe project would have funded half the city’s budget and developers promised environmentally friendly features. But town meetings overflowed, and emails, texts and phone calls were overwhelmingly opposed, “999 to one against,” Higdon said.\n\nHad council approved it, “every person that voted for it would no longer be in office,” the mayor said. “That's for sure.”\n\nIn Hermantown, a suburb of Duluth, Minnesota, a proposed data center campus several times larger than the Mall of America is on hold amid challenges over whether the city’s environmental review was adequate.\n\nResidents found each other through social media and, from there, learned to organize, protest, door-knock and get their message out.\n\nThey say they felt betrayed and lied to when they discovered that state, county, city and utility officials knew about the proposal for an entire year before the city — responding to a public records request filed by the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy — released internal emails that confirmed it.\n\n“It’s the secrecy. The secrecy just drives people crazy,” said Jonathan Thornton, a realtor who lives across a road from the site.\n\nDocuments revealing the extent of the project emerged days before a city rezoning vote in October. Mortenson, which is developing it for a Fortune 50 company that it hasn't named, says it is considering changes based on public feedback and that “more engagement with the community is appropriate.\"\n\nRebecca Gramdorf found out about it from a Duluth newspaper article, and immediately worried that it would spell the end of her six-acre vegetable farm.\n\nShe found other opponents online, ordered 100 yard signs and prepared for a struggle.\n\n“I don’t think this fight is over at all,” Gramdorf said.\n\nFollow Marc Levy on X at https://x.com/timelywriter.",

    "title": "Fish Shell Tips and Tricks",
    "description": "A collection of tips and tricks for the fish shell I wish I had known about a long time ago.",
    "fullText": "I recently watched a video by Dreams of Code, which presents nice tips\nand tricks that can be used in the popular zsh shell. Since I use fish instead, I figured it would be a good opportunity to transfer some of those tips over,\nlearn a bit myself, and hopefully help you as well.\n\nThis article will not describe the zsh tips (or only briefly); instead, I invite you to watch the video linked above.\nThey have all been transposed to fish in the sections below (and some more).\n\nSimilar to zsh’s edit-command-buffer widget (which must be bound manually), fish allows one to edit the command\nbuffer in your configured $VISUAL or $EDITOR tool with the default keybinding alt-e.\n\nIn the cast below, the buffer opens in helix, my modal editor of choice!\n\nWhen modifying the command buffer inline with shortcuts such as alt-backspace (deleting a whole\nargument), it’s sometimes convenient to be able to undo the last modification.\n\nfish has a default key assignment for this: ctrl-z. You could have guessed that, right?\n\nThe redo command is bound to ctrl-r by default, but since I use that to open atuin (a really awesome tool, if you don’t know!), I changed the binding:\n\nIn bash, there’s a convenient alias !! to reference the content of the previous command that was run. The same is\navailable in zsh, but there is no equivalent (by default) in fish. However, it’s trivial to implement it with a\ncustom function and associated abbreviation:\n\nIn the video by Dreams of Code, an annoyance mentioned is having to retype a command that was run without sudo but\nrequired it. The proposed solution is to type sudo !! to invoke the last command with sudo.\n\nIn fish, however, there’s a better way! The built-in shortcut alt-s prepends the current\ncommand with sudo, doas, please, or run0, as available. This can even be combined with the previous tip by\ntyping !! followed by alt-s to re-run the last command. Alternatively, bringing up the last\nhistory item with the up arrow before hitting the shortcut also works.\n\nzsh has chpwd(), a hook that runs some code any time the current directory is changed. A very similar thing can be\ndone in fish with the following syntax:\n\nThe function runs any time the special $PWD environment variable changes. In general however, I prefer to rely on direnv for that purpose. That way, the commands to run are defined in a .envrc file which can\nbe different for each directory.\n\nAnother neat trick shown in the video is the ability to enter a filename (without a command before), and zsh applies\nsome replacement template based on the file extension, allowing one to open the file with the desired binary\nautomatically. The feature in question is called “suffix aliases”.\n\nThe best way to go about this is to create a function invoked when the entered command cannot be resolved. That’s what\nthe special fish_command_not_found function does. Here, I chose to view text files with bat and open other files with different editors (those are just examples; in\npractice, you might want to add more extensions and programs).\n\nFirst, the file extension is extracted from the filename, and then a different program is chosen depending on the\nextension. This works because entering a filename (without a command preceding it) doesn’t normally do anything in fish,\nresulting in a “command not found” error. We catch this error and add behavior in case we find that we have passed a\nvalid file.\n\nUnfortunately, I couldn’t find an easy way to have arbitrary path autocompletion in first position (command position).\nSo the full name must be written by hand. Let me know if you find a way to enable completions for files without a\ncommand!\n\nAbbreviations are one of the best features in fish. Unlike\naliases, they expand to show their content, enabling customization of the command, adding parameters and so on.\n\nAliases can be forced to resolve only when they are in command position (first word, which is the default) or anywhere\nin the line as we’ll see below.\n\nThis enables some cool features inspired by the aforementioned video.\n\nSince abbreviations can be usable anywhere in a command with --position anywhere, they can be used to add suffixes to\ncommands to pipe their standard output or errors to /dev/null.\n\nOf course, long commands can be shortened nicely:\n\nIt can also be useful for bookmarks:\n\nHowever, much like Dreams of Code, I prefer to use zoxide to navigate\ndirectories, so much so that I have it aliased to cd.\n\nEven more powerful, it’s possible to indicate where the cursor should be positioned after expansion:\n\nThe % symbol is the default marker for the cursor position (which is used if we don’t specify another marker with --set-cursor=MARKER).\n\nSometimes it’s useful to clear the screen while keeping whatever was already written in the command prompt. The default\nbinding for this is ctrl-l. In zsh, it seems this requires some widget scripting.\n\nThere are many options to copy and paste parts of the command buffer to the system clipboard or fish’s pasteboard,\nwhich is ominously called the Kill Ring.\n\nThe one I use the most is copying the whole content of the buffer into the system clipboard, which is easy enough with\nthe ctrl-x shortcut. To paste, a simple ctrl-v does the trick.\n\nAs a bonus, I just found out about the directory history, which enables navigation to previously visited folders with\nthe alt-left shortcut (when the command line is empty). Similarly, one can go forward in the\nhistory with alt-right. A game-changer when switching between two projects frequently!\n\nI hope you found something useful in this article. Thanks to Dreams of Code for\ninspiring this article. Until next time!",

    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nNational average mortgage rates basically unchanged from last weekend. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.44%. It has been an extended period of very calm mortgage rates.\n\nMORE: See the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nLearn whether now is a good time to refinance your mortgage.\n\nUse the mortgage calculator below to see how various mortgage terms and interest rates will impact your monthly payments.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use. It also considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when determining your estimated monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a more realistic idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nThe average 30-year mortgage rate today is 6.01%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is lower than with a shorter-term loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44% today. When deciding between a 15-year and a 30-year mortgage, consider your short-term versus long-term goals.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to accumulate. But the trade-off is that your monthly payment will be higher as you pay off the same amount in half the time.\n\nLet’s say you get a $300,000 mortgage. With a 30-year term and a 6.01% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,800, and you’d pay $348,209 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.44% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,442. But you’d only pay $139,508 in interest over the years.\n\nWith a fixed-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for the entire life of your loan. You will get a new rate if you refinance your mortgage, though.\n\nAn adjustable-rate mortgage keeps your rate the same for a predetermined period of time. Then, the rate will go up or down depending on several factors, such as the economy and the maximum amount your rate can change according to your contract. For example, with a 7/1 ARM, your rate would be locked in for the first seven years, then change every year for the remaining 23 years of your term.\n\nAdjustable rates typically start lower than fixed rates, but once the initial rate-lock period ends, it’s possible your rate will go up. Lately, though, some fixed rates have been starting lower than adjustable rates. Talk to your lender about its rates before choosing one or the other.\n\nRead more about fixed-rate vs. adjustable-rate mortgages.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, great or excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So, if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nWaiting for rates to drop probably isn’t the best method to get the lowest mortgage rate right now. If you’re ready to buy, focusing on your personal finances is probably the best way to lower your rate.\n\nTo find the best mortgage lender for your situation, apply for mortgage preapproval with three or four companies. Just be sure to apply to all of them within a short time frame — doing so will give you the most accurate comparisons and have less of an impact on your credit score.\n\nWhen choosing a lender, don’t just compare interest rates. Look at the mortgage annual percentage rate (APR) — this factors in the interest rate, any discount points, and fees. The APR, which is also expressed as a percentage, reflects the true annual cost of borrowing money. This is probably the most important number to look at when comparing mortgage lenders.\n\nLearn 6 tips for choosing a mortgage lender.\n\nAccording to Zillow, the national average 30-year mortgage rate for purchasing a home is 6.01%, and the average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.44%. But these are national averages, so the average in your area could be different. Averages are typically higher in expensive parts of the U.S. and lower in less expensive areas.\n\nThe average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.01% right now, according to Zillow. However, you might get an even better rate with an excellent credit score, sizable down payment, and low debt-to-income ratio (DTI).\n\nNot much. According to its December forecast, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.4% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate above 6% through next year, yet dipping down to 5.9% in Q4 2026.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program. Learn how much equity you need to refinance.\n\nThe best mortgage refinance companies charge low interest rates and fees, and they often have unique perks for customers. Find your best mortgage refinance lender.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea. Learn what to know and how to prepare for refinancing your mortgage at the beginning of 2026.\n\nA mortgage refinance can cost 2% to 6% of the loan amount.

    "fullText": "The combined efforts between government officials and the public have helped significantly reduce the population of an invasive species in a Florida county.\n\nAccording to Observer Local News, the number of wild hogs caught in Flagler County has dropped by one-third in just the past year. There has been a management and removal program in place for the past few years from the Land Management department, but the addition of a reporting dashboard for residents to alert officials to wild hog sightings has added to their efforts.\n\nIn 2023, before the reporting program was in place, 255 hogs were captured. After the program began in 2024, that number went up to 604, and this year it stands at 412.\n\n\"One of the positive things that we can see is — you want that number to start going down. And it is actually starting to go down because of the excellent results that we're getting,\" Land Management Director Erik Revuelta told Observer Local News.\n\nThe animals are known to cause thousands of dollars in damage to property, and Revuelta said that the hogs are being pushed more and more onto private property thanks to habitat destruction from human development.\n\nWild hogs are not native to Florida, but according to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission have been in the state for hundreds of years, possibly introduced by Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto around 1539.\n\nDespite their long tenure in the state, they are still a threat to native plants and wildlife, outcompeting them for resources and consuming them unchecked in some cases. The University of Florida reports that economic damage from wild hogs is actually in the billions for the state, as these animals feed on crops, destroy terrain, affect livestock, and are capable of transmitting serious diseases to animals and humans alike.\n\nThe efforts to remove the invasive pigs are an excellent reminder of the need to support native species in your area. You can take steps in your own backyard by planting native plants, which encourage local animals to utilize them for food and habitat, and are easier and cheaper to maintain than many other invasive species.\n\nDo you think humans are doing enough to protect endangered animals?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The OLED evo W6 from LG makes a glorious return with an even more minimalist design.",
    "fullText": "It's been nearly 10 years since LG first introduced its Wallpaper TV that was so thin that the mounting process felt like applying wallpaper. After eventually discontinuing the ultra-thin TVs in 2020, LG is finally reviving the Wallpaper TV series with the OLED evo W6 that will make its debut at CES 2026. LG is marketing the updated Wallpaper TV as the \"world's thinnest\" OLED that's truly wireless, making some major upgrades to the original.\n\nInstead of the companion soundbar that housed all the ports, LG designed the Zero Connect Box that hosts all the inputs and can transmit from up to roughly 32 feet away. It's similar to what Samsung has been doing with its Wireless One Connect Box, which is often paired with its Frame TV lineup. While you won't have to worry about a web of tangled wires or a clunky soundbar, the OLED evo W6 measures slightly thicker at 9mm, compared to its predecessor's hyperthin 2.6mm measurement. That's more than three times the thickness, but it's still impressive if you consider that the W6 will feel about as thick as putting an iPhone 17 Pro Max against your wall.\n\nThe latest Wallpaper TV does come with plenty of improvements, though, including LG's third-gen α 11 Processor. LG also added its new Hyper Radiant Color Technology to the W6, which translates to deeper blacks, improved colors and higher brightness levels. There's even a Brightness Booster Ultra feature that LG claims results in four times the brightness of conventional OLED. To complement the extra nits, LG specifically designed a screen that reduces reflections for the Wallpaper TV.\n\nThe updated W6 can handle gaming better, too, since it supports a 4K 165Hz refresh rate and has a 0.1 pixel response time that's crucial for competitive gaming. LG added compatibility with NVIDIA's G-Sync, AMD's FreeSync Premium, Google Gemini and Microsoft Copilot. When you're not using the Wallpaper TV, LG has its Gallery+ feature that can display screensaver visuals, personal photos or images created with generative AI.\n\nLG didn't reveal what sizes the upgraded Wallpaper TV would be available in, but it will be on display later this week at CES 2026. LG hasn't offered any clues about pricing yet either, but we wouldn't be surprised to see an equally shocking price as compared to the last Wallpaper TV, which cost up to $20,000.",

    "fullText": "ALTADENA, Calif. (AP) — “DANGER: Lead Work Area” reads a sign on a front door of an Altadena home. “May damage fertility or the unborn child. Causes damage to the central nervous system.”\n\nBlock after block there are reminders that contaminants still linger.\n\nHouse cleaners, hazardous waste workers and homeowners alike come and go wearing masks, respirators, gloves and hazmat suits as they wipe, vacuum and power-wash homes that weren’t burnt to ash.\n\nIt’s been a year of heartbreak and worry since the most destructive wildfires in the Los Angeles area's history scorched neighborhoods and displaced tens of thousands of people. Two wind-whipped blazes that ignited on Jan. 7, 2025, killed at least 31 people and destroyed nearly 17,000 structures, including homes, schools, businesses and places of worship. Rebuilding will take years.\n\nThe disaster has brought another wave of trauma for people afraid of what still lurks inside their homes.\n\nIndoor air quality after wildfires remains understudied, and scientists still don’t know the long-term health impacts of exposure to massive urban fires like last year’s in Los Angeles. But some chemicals released are known to be linked to heart disease and lung issues, and exposure to minerals like magnetite has been associated with Alzheimer’s disease.\n\nAsh in the area is a toxic soup of incinerated cars, electronics, paints, furniture and every other kind of personal belonging. It can contain pesticides, asbestos, plastics, lead or other heavy metals.\n\nMany with homes still standing are now living with the hazards left by the fires.\n\nPeople forced back into their Altadena homes\n\nNina and Billy Malone considered their home of 20 years a safe haven before smoke, ash and soot seeped inside, leaving behind harmful levels of lead even after professional cleaning. Recent testing found the toxin is still on the wooden floors of their living room and bedroom.\n\nThey were forced to move back home in August anyway, after insurance cut off their rental assistance.\n\nSince then, Nina wakes up almost daily with a sore throat and headaches. Billy had to get an inhaler for his worsening wheezing and congestion. And their bedroom, Nina said, smells “like an ashtray has been sitting around for a long time.\" She worries most about exposure to unregulated contaminants that insurance companies aren't required to test.\n\n\"I don’t feel comfortable in the space,” said Nina, whose neighbors' homes burned down across the street.\n\nData shows dangerous lead levels still in homes\n\nAccording to a report released in November by the Eaton Fire Residents United, a volunteer group formed by residents, six out of 10 homes damaged from smoke from the Eaton Fire still have dangerous levels of cancer-causing asbestos, brain-damaging lead or both. That’s based on self-submitted data from 50 homeowners who have cleaned their homes, with 78% hiring professional cleaners.\n\nOf the 50 homes, 63% have lead levels above the Environmental Protection Agency’s standard, according to the report. The average lead levels were almost 60 times higher than the EPA's rule.\n\nEven after fires were extinguished, volatile organic compounds from smoke, some known to cause cancer, lingered inside of people's homes, according to a recent study. To mitigate these risks, residents returning home should ventilate and filter indoor air by opening windows or running high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) purifiers with charcoal filters.\n\nZoe Gonzalez Izquierdo said she can’t get her insurance company to pay for an adequate cleanup of her family's Altadena home, which tested positive for dangerous levels of lead and other toxic compounds.\n\n“They can’t just send a company that’s not certified to just wipe things down so that then we can go back to a still contaminated home,” Gonzalez said, who has children ages 2 and 4.\n\nExperts believe the lead, which can linger in dust on floors and windowsills, comes from burned lead paint. The University of Southern California reported that more than 70% of homes within the Eaton Fire were built before 1979, when lead paint was common.\n\n“For individuals that are pregnant, for young children, it’s particularly important that we do everything we can to eliminate exposure to lead,” said pediatrician Dr. Lisa Patel, executive director for the Medical Society Consortium on Climate and Health and a member of the climate group Science Moms.\n\nThe same goes for asbestos, she added, because there is no safe level of exposure.\n\nPeople who lived in the Pacific Palisades, which was also scorched, face similar challenges.\n\nResidents are at the mercy of their insurance companies, who decide on what they cover and how much. It’s a grueling, constant battle for many. The state’s insurer of last resort, known as the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements Plan, has been scrutinized for years over its handling of fire damage claims.\n\nHomeowners want state agencies to enforce a requirement that insurance companies return a property to pre-fire condition.\n\nJulie Lawson won't take any risks. Her family paid about $7,000 out of pocket to test the soil in their Altadena home, even though their insurance company had already agreed to pay to replace the grass in their front yard. They planned to test for contaminants again once they finished remediating the inside, the process of making a home contaminant-free after a fire. If insurance won't cover it, they'll pay for it themselves.\n\nEven if their home is livable again, they still face other losses — including equity and the community they once had.\n\n“We have to live in the scar,\" she said. “We're all still really struggling.\"\n\nThey will be living in a construction zone for years. “This isn't over for us.”\n\nChallenges and mental health toll\n\nAnnie Barbour with the nonprofit United Policyholders has been helping people navigate the challenges, which include insurance companies resisting to pay for contamination testing and industrial hygienists disagreeing on what to test for.\n\nShe sees the mental health toll it's having on people — and as a survivor herself of the 2017 Tubbs Fire in Northern California, she understands it.\n\nMany were at first joyful to see their houses still standing.\n\n“But they’ve been in their own special kind of hell ever since,” Barbour said.\n\nNow residents like the Malones are inspecting their belongings, one by one, fearing they may have absorbed toxins.\n\nBoxes, bags and bins stuffed with clothes, chinaware and everything in between fill the couple's car, basement, garage and home.\n\nThey have been painstakingly going through their things, assessing what they think can be adequately cleaned. In the process, Nina is cleaning cabinets, drawers, floors and still finding soot and ash. She wears gloves and a respirator, or sometimes just an N-95 mask.\n\nTheir insurance won't pay to retest their home, Billy said, so they're considering paying the $10,000 themselves. And if results show there's still contamination, their insurance company told them they will only pay to clean up toxins that are federally regulated, like lead and asbestos.\n\n“I don't know how you fight that,” said Nina, who is considering therapy to cope with her anxiety. “How do you find that argument to compel an insurance company to pay for something to make yourself safe?”\n\nAP staff writer Alex Veiga contributed to this report.\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from the Walton Family Foundation for coverage of water and environmental policy.

    "description": "Archaeologists confirm a mile-long tunnel network under Cusco’s Temple of the Sun, revealing Incan engineering and links to key sites like Sacsahuaman.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThe existence of a tunnel network under the ancient Peruvian city of Cusco had been rumored for centuries.\n\nAt times stretching more than a mile, the labyrinth connected the Temple of the Sun to key points, such as a fortress.\n\nIncan builders made use of what’s known as the cut-and-cover method of crafting tunnels.\n\nThe Incan Temple of the Sun in Cusco has long been a visual and cultural jewel of the ancient empire. But there’s even more to admire below ground. Recently, archaeologists confirmed a long-held rumor: the existence of a labyrinth of underground tunnels extending out from the temple, sometimes over a mile in length.\n\nFirst hinted at in historical texts that date as far back as the 16th century, researchers have wondered if this labyrinth—known as a chincana—was real. Turns out, it is.\n\nArchaeologist Jorge Calero Flores announced the findings at a press conference, and said the research team found a main branch connecting the temple to the fortress of Sacsahuaman, just over one mile away. The system is made up of three smaller branches—one near the Church of San Cristóbal, another to an area near the fortress, and a third to an area known as Callispuquio.\n\nThe Peru Archaeologists Association said that the tunnels were created by the Inca people. They first dug trenches, and then supported them with stone walls and carved-beam ceilings. Calero Flores said that the tunnel system is roughly 8.5 feet wide and 5.2 feet high. “We suspect that the Inca could have been carried in litters through there,” he said, according to the Jerusalem Post.\n\nThe path to finding the ancient labyrinth started with Jesuit texts from the 16th century. An anonymous Spanish Jesuit individual wrote about a tunnel in 1594 that connected the bishop’s housing to the Cusco Cathedral, alluding to the fact the tunnel originated at the Temple of the Sun. A later document from chronicler Anello de Oliva also discussed multiple underground passages in the city. The texts noted that, during construction in the area, workers ensured they did not disturb the tunnel network—one that started at a cave in the fortress. That was enough, Flores said, to give archaeologists “an idea” of where to look.\n\nBefore probing the ground, the team used acoustic prospecting to find hollow areas. That data gave them a better understanding of where to use ground-penetrating radar to create a more specific map of the chincana.\n\nArchaeologist Mildred Fernandez Palomino said that the next step in learning more about the tunnels is getting inside them. “Now we have to excavate at key points to be able to enter the chincana,” she said, according to IFL Science.\n\nResearchers believe that the tunnel system was an underground representation of the above-ground street network of the ancient Incan city of Cusco. Located about 130 miles from Machu Picchu, Cusco was once a thriving hub for the Inca Empire. Now, it’s a popular tourist spot and an archaeological marvel.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "Marco Rubio was visibly irritated to be reminded that despite the capture of former president Nicolás Maduro, the dictator’s regime is still in power in Venezuela. “I’m curious why the Trump administration decided to leave [Maduro’s regime] intact and only arrest Nicolás Maduro and his wife,” host Margaret Brennan questioned on Face the Nation Sunday, pointing out others in Maduro’s government who were indicted in the U.S. “I’m confused. Are they still wanted by the United States?",
    "fullText": "Marco Rubio was visibly irritated to be reminded that despite the capture of former president Nicolás Maduro, the dictator’s regime is still in power in Venezuela.\n\n“I’m curious why the Trump administration decided to leave [Maduro’s regime] intact and only arrest Nicolás Maduro and his wife,” host Margaret Brennan questioned on Face the Nation Sunday, pointing out others in Maduro’s government who were indicted in the U.S.\n\n“I’m confused. Are they still wanted by the United States? Why didn’t you arrest them if you are taking out the narcoterrorist regime?” she asked.\n\n“You’re confused? I don’t know why that is confusing to you,” Rubio responded, with Brennan repeating: “They are still in power.”\n\nThe secretary of state lashed out at the CBS News host, saying that there was already enough “complaining” about the capture of just one Venezuelan politician—and that the military operation was difficult enough as it was.\n\n“You’re going to go in and suck up five people? They are already complaining about this one operation. Imagine the howls we would have from everybody else if we actually had to go and stay there four days to capture four other people,” Rubio said.\n\n“We got the top priority. The number one person on the list was the guy who claimed to be the president of the country that he was not, and he was arrested along with his wife who is also indicted. That was a sophisticated, and frankly complicated operation.”\n\nAs Brennan agreed with the complexity of the raid, Rubio continued: “It is not easy to land helicopters in the middle of the largest military base in the country. The guy lived on a military base. Land within three minutes, kick down his door, grab him, put him in handcuffs, read him his rights, and leave the country without losing any American or any American assets.\n\n“That’s not an easy mission. You’re asking me why didn’t we do that in five other places at the same time? I mean, that’s absurd.”\n\nRubio persisted in fawning over the operation, adding: “I do think it’s one of the most, you know, daring, complicated, sophisticated missions this country has carried out in a very long time. Tremendous credit to the U.S. military personnel who did it. It was unbelievable, and a tremendous success.\n\n“And today, an indicted drug trafficker—who was not the legitimate president of Venezuela, who we do not recognize, the Biden administration didn’t recognize, sixty-something countries don’t recognize, the European Union doesn’t recognize, and many countries in Latin America don’t recognize—he was an indicted drug trafficker. He was arrested, his wife was arrested—\"\n\nBrennan interjected and once again asked about the co-conspirators left behind. “Right, but the others who were also indicted are still in place, so that is the point of my questioning there. You talked about not being the legitimate president—\"\n\nRubio interrupted in turn, accusing: “So you wanted us to land in five other military bases?”\n\n“No, I’m asking why you chose that this was the limit of the military operation. To your point that you just made that Maduro was not the legitimate president,” Brennan responded.\n\n“He was claiming to be the president,” said Rubio, speaking over Brennan again to specify: “He was the top target.”",

    "fullText": "Snow droughts in Utah could impact how much water is available in 2026.\n\nUtah tends to get an average of 275 inches of snow a year, but this winter has seen a 25-year low of snowfall, according to Kuer.\n\nIt's not just skiers who are impacted by the warmer weather — it could have a serious impact on water supplies.\n\nLake Powell and Lake Mead, the country's two largest reservoirs, rely on melted snowpack to provide water to tens of millions of Americans.\n\nAccording to the Colorado River Research Group, even a near-average snowpack over the colder months could mean that these reservoir water levels could drop to a record-low in 2026.\n\nJack Schmidt, the co-author of the report and the director of the Center for Colorado River Studies at Utah State University, commented to Kuer on the record-low water levels, \"We would be in unprecedented territory.\"\n\nAlong with low snowfall so far, dry soils near Lake Powell will likely soak up a lot of water before it reaches the water system. Schmidt added that not all of the water in the reservoirs will be usable, and said, \"We're closer to the edge of the cliff than we realize.\"\n\nThree-quarters of the water usage in Utah goes towards agriculture, so low levels and potential droughts could have a severe impact on food systems, farmers' income, and the economy as a whole.\n\nAs well as that, droughts can leave people without water in their homes and can result in wildfires and other extreme weather events.\n\nThis snow drought is another piece of a worrying pattern that could have severe impacts on the health of people and the planet. Although extreme weather events have been around forever, human-induced harm to the planet supercharges them.\n\nHow worried are you about rising ocean levels?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nThe report called for a reduction in water consumption so that the lack of resources can be spread further.\n\nOn a governmental level, there are some options that could help temporarily prop up the reservoirs, but they would be risky and only act as a short-term fix. For example, water could be released from the Flaming Gorge Reservoir in northeast Utah to fill up Lake Powell. Another option would be to reduce the amount of water being let off to go to California, Arizona, and Nevada.\n\nUltimately, the rising temperatures and carbon pollution need to be tackled to prevent further droughts.\n\nIn your personal life, you could consider installing solar panels, switching to an electric vehicle, or upgrading your lawn to a less water-intensive native lawn.\n\nTo protect your house from potential droughts, you could consider collecting rainwater for a free supply of water.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

No death on our side.”\n\nThe U.S. operation Saturday seized Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife to face prosecution on an indictment accusing them of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy.\n\nWhile Venezuela's government has acknowledged that a number of people died in the American blasts, they did not confirm how many were killed to The Associated Press.\n\nCuba’s government announced two days of mourning for the Cuban officers who were killed, and former president and revolutionary leader Raúl Castro and President Miguel Díaz-Canel sent condolences to their families. The names of the dead and the positions they held were not immediately disclosed by Cuban authorities.\n\n“Faithful to their responsibilities for security and defense, our compatriots fulfilled their duty with dignity and heroism and fell after fierce resistance in direct combat against the attackers or as a result of the bombings of the facilities,” the official statement said.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, also pointed to Cuban involvement in Venezuela over the weekend, saying that Maduro's internal security apparatus was headed by Cubans and that they were “propping up Maduro.”\n\n“All the guards that help protect Maduro — this is well known — their whole spy agency, all that were full of Cubans,” Rubio said.",

    "fullText": "ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (AP) — President Donald Trump on Sunday told reporters that U.S. officials have determined that Ukraine did not target a residence belonging to Russian President Vladimir Putin in a drone attack last week, disputing Kremlin claims that Trump had initially greeted with deep concern.\n\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov last week said Ukraine launched a wave of drones at Putin’s state residence in the northwestern Novgorod region that the Russian defense systems were able to defeat. Lavrov also criticized Kyiv for launching the attack at a moment of intensive negotiations to end the war.\n\nThe allegation came just a day after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had traveled to Florida for talks with Trump on the U.S. administration's still-evolving 20-point plan aimed at ending the war. Zelenskyy quickly denied the Kremlin allegation.\n\nTrump said that “something happened nearby” Putin's residence but that Americans officials didn't find the Russian president's residence was targeted.\n\n“I don’t believe that strike happened,\" Trump told reporters as he traveled back to Washington on Sunday after spending two weeks at his home in Florida. “We don't believe that happened, now that we've been able to check.”\n\nTrump addressed the U.S. determination after European officials argued that the Russian claim was nothing more than an effort by Moscow to undermine the peace effort.\n\nBut Trump, at least initially, had appeared to take the Russian allegations at face value. He told reporters last Monday that Putin had also raised the matter during a phone he had with the Russian leader earlier that day. And Trump said he was “very angry” about the accusation.\n\nThe U.S. president has struggled to fulfill a pledge to quickly end the war in Ukraine and has shown irritation with both Zelenskyy and Putin as he tried to mediate an end to a conflict he boasted on the campaign trail that he could end in one day.\n\nBoth Trump and Zelenskyy said last week they made progress in their talks at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\nBut Putin has shown little interest in ending the war until all of Russia's objectives are met, including winning control of all Ukrainian territory in the key industrial Donbas region and imposing severe restrictions on the size of Ukraine's post-war military and the type of weaponry it can possess.\n\nMadhani reported from Washington.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Ethan Tan, a 24-year-old prawn noodle hawker from Singapore. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've always loved cooking with my mother and watching cooking videos. It took me three painful years studying computer engineering and one corporate internship to decide hawker life was the way to go.\n\nMy parents wanted me to learn something traditional and study engineering or become a doctor.\n\nSo I thought, \"I like playing computer games, so let's pursue computer engineering.\" I didn't think much about it, and I didn't do much research.\n\nWhen the course started, I hated it. I didn't get coding at all. Examinations were hard for me, and I just suffered through them.\n\nThe point where I really felt like this wasn't the right path for me was when I got caught cheating during an exam. I managed to lie to the examiner and pretend I wasn't cheating.\n\nBut that made me realize something: If I have to resort to cheating, this is really not what I want to do.\n\nI did an internship at Accenture. It was the same thing every day: sitting at the same table from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., queuing for lunch at a crowded food court, and taking the train home.\n\nThe only comfort was sleeping in the office chair. I slept there every day for two hours. It was very boring.\n\nWith a corporate job out of the question, I looked for other career paths.\n\nAfter graduating and completing my military service, I joined my father at his seafood hawker stall.\n\nAfter about three years of managing the stall, and a short stint at the kitchens in The American Club in Singapore for some restaurant experience, I told my dad I wanted to build something of my own.\n\nIn August 2024, I opened Udang Udang, a halal prawn noodle stall right beside my father's stall in Singapore's northern Woodlands neighborhood. I used my grandmother's recipes and a recipe I learned from a streetside vendor I met in Penang, Malaysia.\n\nBefore I hired staff, it was rough. I got in early in the mornings to fry up 40 kilograms of prawn heads to make the broth. It needs to boil for six hours, and in Singapore's heat, that's no joke.\n\nBut now, more than a year on, business is faring well. I sell an average of 600 bowls of noodles daily, earning about 3,000 Singapore dollars, or about $2,300, in sales every day. I manage both my dad's stall and my own.\n\nMy plan is now to expand to more outlets around Singapore, with one new store every year.\n\nIt was tough working with my dad at the start. We fought almost every day for the first two years, and many tables were slammed in frustration.\n\nWe don't see eye to eye on many things. I tried to convince him to spend more money on marketing, including hiring influencers to try our food and creating promotional videos, but he prefers for the word to spread organically. We feel differently about how we price our products as well.\n\nIt's been challenging to learn how to work together. But we've nailed it down now, learning how to separate life and work, and talking through our differences.\n\nAt work, we're not father and son. We can fight and argue all we want. But when we get back home, I'm still his beloved son.",

    "fullText": "Denmark and Greenland are once again calling on the US to stop eyeing Greenland as land for sale.\n\nIn a statement on a Danish government website on Sunday, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said, \"I have to say this very directly to the United States.\"\n\n\"It makes absolutely no sense to talk about the need for the United States to take over Greenland,\" she said. \"The United States has no right to annex any of the three countries in the Commonwealth.\"\n\nFrederiksen, who has been the country's prime minister since 2019, said that Greenland, which falls under the Kingdom of Denmark, is part of NATO, \"and is therefore covered by the alliance's security guarantee.\"\n\nShe added that Denmark has a defense agreement with the US, which gives the US access to Greenland. The US has one military base, the Pituffik Space Base, in Greenland.\n\n\"I would therefore strongly urge the United States to stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale,\" Frederiksen said in her statement.\n\nThe Danish prime minister's statement comes after President Donald Trump's former aide, Katie Miller, posted an image on X of a map of Greenland superimposed with the US flag.\n\nThe Sunday post by Miller, who is married to White House Chief of Staff Stephen Miller, was accompanied by the caption, \"SOON.\"\n\nAnd over recent years, Trump has repeatedly talked about the possibility of buying Greenland for US security and to tap into its trove of natural resources.\n\nJesper Møller Sørensen, the Danish ambassador to the US, responded to Miller's post, writing, \"Just a friendly reminder about the US and the Kingdom of Denmark: We are close allies and should continue to work together as such.\"\n\nSørensen added that he expects \"full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark.\"\n\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen said in a Sunday Facebook post, \"Enough is enough.\"\n\nHe said he would not accept \"fantasies of annexation,\" and said that he found the US's messaging \"completely and utterly unacceptable.\"\n\nTrump first floated the idea of buying Greenland during his first term in August 2019, per a report that month by The Wall Street Journal. Greenland's foreign affairs ministry wrote in an X post in the same month, \"We're open for business, not for sale.\"\n\nIn a congressional address in March, shortly after commencing his second term, Trump said the US would take control of Greenland, \"One way or the other.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance and Second Lady Usha Vance also visited Greenland in March.\n\nRepresentatives for Trump and Frederiksen did not respond to requests for comment from Business Insider.",

    "description": "Patria, Finland's biggest defense contractor, is scaling up production as it deals with an order backlog of over 1,000 vehicles from NATO allies.",
    "fullText": "Alarms blare over the factory floors, and work at Patria's Hämeenlinna facility grinds to a halt.\n\nThe soft thrum of an explosion echoes through the campus. Moments later, roughly 700 workers continue making their armored vehicles bound for Japan, Sweden, Slovakia, and other countries. The blast is not a test-firing of its new combat vehicle, but part of the construction for its expanding manufacturing facility.\n\nPatria, Finland's largest defense company, is planning to nearly double production at its main hub just north of Helsinki, clearing rocks with explosives on-site to make way for several new assembly lines.\n\nThe Hämeenlinna factory manufactures Patria's 8×8 armored personnel carrier and a relatively new, up-and-coming vehicle: a wheeled 6×6 troop transport that's receiving surging demand from northern and western Europe.\n\nWork on the 25-foot-long, 17-ton vehicle began in 2020 under a joint program between Finland and Latvia called the Common Armored Vehicles System. Both countries sought a cost-effective, mass-produced armored vehicle that could be used by their militaries for interoperability.\n\nLatvia has since sent at least 42 of these vehicles to Ukraine, armed with heavy machine guns and rolled out in batches over the last year. The vehicle can cross tundra and even rivers while shielding up to 10 troops it carries from land mines and artillery fire to get them to forward positions.\n\nWhen Business Insider visited Patria's factory, representatives for the company — which is majority-owned by the state of Finland — said the firm wasn't authorized to share details about the 6×6's performance in Ukraine.\n\nBut the CAVS 6×6 program has been quickly drawing attention from the rest of Europe: What began as a partnership between two countries has expanded into a consortium of seven member states.\n\nSweden joined the Common Armored Vehicles System program in 2022, followed by Germany, Denmark, the UK, and Norway in subsequent years.\n\nFinland and Latvia have placed orders for just under 500 of these vehicles, while Sweden has requested 415 of the 6×6s to be delivered over the next five years. Stockholm's latest order for 94 vehicles, announced in early December, priced each one at about $1.75 million.\n\nGermany has become the program's largest buyer, signing contracts in mid-December to acquire 876 of the 6×6 vehicles, valued at $2.3 billion. These vehicles will be split into four variants, including one that features a mortar turret.\n\nMeanwhile, Denmark, which joined the program this year, has already placed an order for 129 6×6 vehicles.\n\nThe UK and Norway are still negotiating 6×6 orders with Patria.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 can accommodate roughly 10 troops, along with a typical crew of two or three, and features up to NATO standard level 4 armor designed to withstand direct hits from large-caliber machine gun fire, mine explosions, and nearby artillery blasts.\n\nThe CAVS 6×6 competes with other wheeled troop transports, such as Rheinmetall's Boxer and General Dynamics Land Systems' Stryker, the latter of which is extensively fielded by the US Army.\n\nThe Finnish company said it can tweak the vehicle for each customer's needs, but a typical model features climate control that enables the vehicle to operate in temperatures as low as -40°F.\n\n\"Inside, it will be comfortable enough to easily survive. We are talking about temperatures of the plus centigrades,\" Mikko Rantanen, Patria's director for 6×6 vehicle programs, told Business Insider from inside the rear compartment of one of the vehicles.\n\nThe 6×6's rear interior is spartan: Cloth-covered metal-frame seats and headrests for five people on either side, with space behind each seat for equipment and small arms.\n\nThere's just enough room for a soldier to sit with their knees touching the opposite passenger's. A few fire extinguishers inside are connected to an automatic suppression system that can detect a blaze in the rear cabin.\n\nScreens allow troops to see outside the vehicle through exterior cameras, while a rear hatch provides the option of fitting a machine gun or crewed weapon module on top of the 6×6.\n\nOn the right-hand side of the vehicle, a small passageway also lets troops pass between the rear compartment and the driver's cabin, which resembles that of a truck and features an automatic gearbox.\n\nOptional propellers on the 6×6's underside enable it to transition seamlessly from traversing land to crossing small bodies of water, such as rivers or lakes.\n\n\"We can enter the water without needing preparation in this configuration,\" said Rantanen.\n\nHowever, the 6×6's speed in the water is just under 5 mph, and Rantanen added that it's not meant to be a landing craft or amphibious assault vehicle.\n\nOn land, it's designed to drive at speeds of over 60 mph, easily cross trenches that are four feet wide, and surmount obstacles about two feet high.\n\nBuilding weapons and vehicles specifically for arctic terrain is a specialty for contractors in Finland, a country renowned for holding off the Soviet Union for over 100 days in deep snow and dense forest during World War II.\n\nPatria said that while the 6×6 can be outfitted for various terrain types, including the desert, the arctic domain is its forte.\n\nSnow isn't the only challenge in arctic warfare. Few roads are available on Finland's border with Russia — the priority threat for NATO — and its vast hinterland is peppered with thousands of small lakes and marshland that can bog down armored transport.\n\n\"In the wintertime, it's snow,\" said Petri Hepola, Patria's executive vice president for sales and marketing and its chief program officer for the F-35. \"In the summer, lots of wet soil and swampy areas. One of the most important features is how fast you can move your troops and tools through these areas.\"\n\nFinland and Norway are the only two members of Patria's 6×6 program that share Arctic borders with Russia.\n\nHowever, as northern Europe, especially the Baltic and Nordic states, grows increasingly concerned about conflict with Moscow, the Kremlin has been bolstering its military presence in the high north, repopulating key bases and transforming its Arctic fleet into a separate strategic theater.\n\nSince Finland joined NATO in 2023, alliance forces have been rushing to train on the country's terrain and frigid temperatures, making it one of the most active spots for joint exercises in recent years.\n\n\"Our products have been surviving very well in that environment,\" Hepola said.\n\nWith an order backlog of nearly 2,000 6×6 vehicles, Patria hopes its new facility in Hämeenlinna will be ready for production by 2027. The factory campus serves only the tail end of the entire manufacturing cycle, which can take weeks in most cases, or several months for more complicated variants.\n\nInside, hundreds of workers conduct welding, surface treatment, assembly, tests, and other final processes that can each take weeks to complete. Dozens of vehicles line the factory floors, and dozens more sit in parking lots, each marked with a flag to designate the country for which it has been modified.\n\nBefore delivery, each one is supposed to be driven at least 200 km, or 124 miles.\n\nRantanen, director of the 6×6 program, said Patria has been integrating counter-drone systems, such as jammers, on the vehicle.\n\nArmored vehicles in Ukraine have especially struggled against pervasive minefields and small drones with explosive payloads, some of which are controlled via a fiber optic cable connection that can't be jammed. In response, soldiers there have relied more on firearms such as shotguns and machine guns to counter such attacks.\n\nRantanen said Patria hasn't yet officially added any kinetic weapons that can take down drones.\n\n\"The drone threat is currently evolving at such a speed that it's hard to keep track of it closely,\" he said. \"But we are hard at work for the countermeasures against drones as well.\"",

    "description": "\"And I looked at the fierce, insanely gorgeous blue eyes and thought, 'I see what she means,'\" Mary Steenburgen said.",
    "fullText": "Mary Steenburgen, 72, says her perspective on aging changed after a conversation with Jane Fonda, 88.\n\nSpeaking to People in an interview published on Friday, Steenburgen said she hadn't expected one of their early interactions to have such a lasting impact.\n\n\"When we became friends, I remember her almost walking out the front gate and then turning around, looking at me and saying, 'Are we going to be friends?' And I said, 'Yes.' And she said, 'Now don't just say it by rote. Are you going to be intentional? We've got to be. Because at my age, I have to be intentional,\" Steenburgen said, recalling Fonda's words.\n\n\"And I looked at the fierce, insanely gorgeous blue eyes and thought, 'I see what she means.' I see the intention behind them because there's a clock, and you don't know how long you have. But as you get older, it's shorter,\" she said.\n\nSteenburgen and Fonda were costars in the 2018 film \"Book Club,\" and its 2023 sequel, \"Book Club: The Next Chapter.\"\n\nThat lesson has stayed with Steenburgen and now shapes how she spends time with the people closest to her.\n\n\"With not wasting time on people that aren't in my life for the right reason, for being honest with myself about life. All that stuff, aging, it actually makes it more interesting,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nThe actor said Fonda also encourages her to stay curious and not slow down.\n\n\"And then the other thing that she inspired was, she always said, 'Don't take your foot off the gas pedal. Push it down harder. Harder now.' So we're inspired by that,\" Steenburgen said.\n\nThis isn't the first time Steenburgen has spoken about the lessons she learned about aging. In a 2013 interview with Allure, shortly after she turned 60, Steenburgen said she was excited about growing older.\n\n\"I decided if you're lucky enough to be alive, you should use each birthday to celebrate what your life is about,\" she said.\n\nFonda has also consistently spoken about choosing to age thoughtfully and with intention.\n\nIn November, Fonda said turning 60 made her rethink how she wanted to spend her time.\n\n\"This is the beginning of my final act. And I didn't know how to live it. So I thought, well, what am I most afraid of?\" Fonda said. \"I'm afraid of dying with a lot of regrets. I watched my dad die with a lot of regrets. That was an important realization for me, because if you don't want to die with regrets, then you have to live the last part of your life in such a way that there won't be any regrets.\"",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk joined Donald Trump for dinner during a packed weekend for the president, who was hosting meetings at Mar-a-Lago as his administration announced a US military operation in Venezuela.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that the US had captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, a move that drew swift international reaction.\n\nIn a post on X on Sunday, Musk wrote that he had \"a lovely dinner\" with Trump and first lady Melania Trump, adding: \"2026 is going to be amazing!\"\n\nThe photo posted on X shows the three of them seated at a dinner table, chatting. The dinner took place on Saturday evening at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, according to Fox News.\n\nHad a lovely dinner last night with @POTUS and @FLOTUS.\n\n2026 is going to be amazing! pic.twitter.com/1Oq35b1PEC\n\nThe dinner comes after a very public cooling of relations between Trump and Musk last year.\n\nIn November, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO attended a White House dinner with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — his first public appearance at the White House since falling out with Trump in June. The guest list included several top executives.\n\nAfter the dinner, Musk shared photos on X showing himself with the crown prince, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, and Trump. \"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nIn September, the two were spotted shaking hands at a memorial service for political activist Charlie Kirk, marking their first public interaction since their alliance collapsed.\n\nThe relationship between the two publicly unraveled in June, shortly after Musk stepped away from his role as the de facto head of the White House's DOGE Office.\n\nBefore the fallout, Musk was one of Trump's most visible and influential allies. He described himself as Trump's \"first buddy\" after the president's election win.\n\nMusk later played a central role in the administration's effort to cut government spending before leaving the post in May.\n\nTensions escalated after Musk criticized Trump's \"Big Beautiful Bill,\" prompting a public back-and-forth between the two men. Musk said Trump owed his presidential election win to him, while Trump threatened to pull government contracts held by Musk's companies.\n\nIn July, Musk said he would launch a new political party called the \"America Party.\"\n\n\"Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom,\" Musk wrote in an X post. Trump fired back on his Truth Social platform, saying Musk had gone \"completely off the rails.\"",

    "title": "Oil prices swing after Trump's Venezuela raid as investors eye global supply",
    "description": "The oil market was already under pressure before the latest development, with crude futures falling 20% last year.",
    "fullText": "Oil futures fluctuated between gains and losses in the first trading day since the US captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro over the weekend.\n\nUS benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures fell as much as 1.4% in the opening hour of trading before moving sideways. They were 0.5% lower at $57.01 at midnight on Monday.\n\nInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were 0.4% lower at $60.50 a barrel after falling as much as 1.4% in early trade.\n\nThe oil market has been under pressure, with crude prices falling 20% last year. A main issue facing the market is an oversupply of global crude. It's been a focus of OPEC+, which also over the weekend said it will refrain from pumping new oil during the first quarter.\n\nDespite Venezuela's vast oil reserves — estimated at about one-fifth of the global total — the country's output accounts for less than 1% of global daily oil production, reflecting years of aging infrastructure and the impact of sanctions.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, President Donald Trump said on Saturday that US oil companies will invest billions of dollars in Venezuela.\n\nIf Venezuelan oil production does pick up, analysts say it could take time and big money.\n\n\"It will take tens of billions of dollars in investment and at least a decade of Western oil majors committing to the country,\" wrote Peter McNally, the global head of sector analysts at research firm Third Bridge, on Sunday.\n\nMcNally added that there are no swift solutions for Venezuela, where years of underinvestment have eroded infrastructure across the economy, and a severe power crisis continues to disrupt daily life.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs echoed that view in a Sunday note, writing that \"higher recovery rates of heavy Venezuela oil will likely require financial and time investments in oil-processing upgraders and improvements in operational efficiencies, power availability, and oil transporting infrastructure.\"\n\nVenezuela produced around 3 million barrels a day of oil at its peak in the mid-2000s.\n\nEven before the US captured Maduro, Venezuela's oil exports had already come under pressure after Trump imposed a blockade of sanctioned oil tankers entering or leaving Venezuelan waters last month. The blockade remains in place.\n\nGoldman Sachs said the latest developments increase the likelihood of a shift toward a policy environment more supportive of oil investment, even as short-term changes to oil flows — including both modest increases and further disruptions — remain possible.\n\nThe developments are negative for oil prices over the long run, as any sustained increase in Venezuelan output would add to already ample supply at a time of slowing demand growth, according to Goldman.\n\n\"Production may edge up slightly in the short-run, including in a scenario with a US-supported government and full sanctions relief. Alternatively, disruptions to Venezuela oil deliveries could continue and/or intensify in the short-run, for instance because Maduro's cabinet has asserted its control,\" wrote Goldman's analysts.\n\nGoldman estimates WTI and Brent to average $51 a barrel and $58 a barrel, respectively, should Venezuelan crude production fall by 400,000 barrels a day by the end of 2026.\n\nShould the country's crude production rise by 400,000 barrels a day instead, WTI and Brent are expected to average $50 a barrel and $54 a barrel, respectively, in 2026, the analysts added.",

    "title": "My Five Favorite Things I Saw at CES Unveiled 2026",
    "description": "I saw robotic dogs, 3D screen protectors for your iPhone, and rapid food allergen testers.",
    "fullText": "While CES doesn't technically kick off until Tuesday, the conference gets a bit of a soft launch with CES Unveiled. This event hosts a ton of companies, all proudly showing off their latest products and concepts in one giant room. While there's plenty to write home about, five products in particular this year caught my eye:\n\nTombot's robotic puppy, \"Jennie,\" isn't supposed to be a pet-replacement. Instead, Jennie is specifically designed to help people with Alzheimer's. The bot is a healthcare device, and is made to not only comfort owners, but to monitor \"sundowning,\" or the confusion that some living with Alzheimer experience in late afternoon and at night.\n\nI can't speak to the medical claims, but Tombot impressed me. I've seen products like this before, but what struck me was the realism. That's not to say Tombot's robot tricks you into thinking there's a real puppy on the table. But the company has designed the bot with enough motors and sensors to make it realistic enough. When you look at Jennie, she looks at you; when you move, her face reacts in kind, powered by cleverly-placed motors. There are capacitive touch sensors to react to touch, light sensors to adjust to the lighting of the room, gyros for orientation, and microphones to responds to sounds.\n\nJennie is designed to be interactive: You can call its name—either Jennie, or a name you set in the app—and it responds to the call, potentially with a bark. Tombot says that it hired a number of ten-week-old lab puppies to record the voices for its bot. In all, Jennie will have about 1,500 unique behaviors when Tombot launches her this year.\n\nTombot told me that Jennie is designed to last all day on a single charge. When you aren't home, Jennie can drop into a sort of low power mode, that should last over a week. When you come back, Jennie should immediately welcome you home. Tombot says its bot will cost $1,500 at launch, but will offer financing options.\n\nWhat if you could turn your iPhone into a 3DS? That's what I took away from the premise of CubicSpace's CubicScreen, anyway. The company makes a screen protector for your iPhone embedded with an optical filter that allows you to view spatial photos and videos in 3D, without the need for glasses or a separate device. It's your 2D iPhone, in 3D.\n\nI was a bit skeptical walking past the booth, but, in practice, the tech really works. CubicSpace had some 3D photos and videos already stored in the CubicScreen app on their demo iPhones, and, when looking at the screen, they really did appear three dimensional. This isn't \"pop out of your screen\" 3D, mind you; rather, it's an depth effect. If you've ever used the 3D feature on a 3DS, this is that experience: You'll be able to see the depth behind subjects in your photos and videos, which adds to the immersion of the image.\n\nPart of the effect uses eye tracking to adjust the effect as you view the image. To that point, the app can support zooming while retaining the 3D effect. It's a little trippy: You zoom in on an picture, and, most of the time, it snaps into 3D instantly. Sometimes, the effect falls out, and you can tell you're looking at a distorted image. But most of my experience, the effect held.\n\nThis 3D effect wasn't just a trick of editing, either: CubicSpace took a photo of Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor, Michelle Ehrhardt at the booth, which instantly took on the 3D effect. The screen overlay and the software appears to work fast.\n\nCubicScreen will cost $79 when it launches. There is currently an order page, but they aren't accepting payment yet.\n\nIf you have a food allergy, you know the stress that comes when you're not in control of your meals. There's a risk to eating food you didn't make yourself, and for some of us, that risk isn't an option.\n\nThat's why I found Allergen Alert's \"the mini lab\" so intriguing. The idea is, when you want to know whether your food contains a certain allergen, you can scoop a sample of it into the provided container, place that container into the mini lab, and within two minutes, you'll have a positive or negative result. The device itself isn't large—about the size of a portable speaker—which makes it feasible to take out to restaurants and other people's houses.\n\nRight now, the company says the mini lab can detect milk and gluten, up to five parts per million, but the goal is to detect other major allergens, like egg, fish, soy, sesame, peanuts shellfish, tree nuts. Of course, I have no way to actually test whether it can detect milk and gluten at this time, so I can't necessarily endorse the product. In fact, it isn't currently available: Allergen Alert tells me the product is supposed to launch in September for $200.\n\nHowever, if Allergen Alert is correct in its claims, this product could be a game changer. A two minute check on that supposedly allergen-free meal could literally save someone's life, and offer peace of mind to those who could have serious adverse effects from ingesting an allergen.\n\nBirdfy brings a new smart bird feeder concept to CES just about every year. And while the company had its previous models on display at Unveiled this year, its newest prototype grabbed my attention.\n\nThe Hum Bloom is not meant for all of the birds that visit your house or garden. Instead, this product is specifically designed for hummingbirds. The Hum Bloom has an 4K camera that can shoot up to 120fps slow-motion video. While that'd make for some dramatic landings for any bird, it's particularly ideal for capturing hummingbirds that flap their wings hundreds or thousands of times per minute.\n\nBirdfy says the Hum Bloom's AI can identify more than 150 hummingbird species, so you'll know which type of bird you're watching in slo-mo on your phone. Birdfy claims the feeder is \"leak-proof,\" and also comes with ant moat to keep out bugs. Personally, I'm stuck on Birdfy designing a slo-mo camera system just for hummingbirds. I look forward to seeing that footage from reviewers in the future.\n\nThis is one of those products my picture will simply not do justice. In order to understand why I was so taken by this speaker, you'd need to hear it for yourself.\n\nAdmittedly, I wasn't expecting much when I agreed to demo the speaker. Again, at first glance, the Opsodis just looks like your typical wireless speaker. That changed once the rep played a video on a connected iPad: Suddenly, I was hearing sounds next to my ears; behind my ears; around my ears. I wasn't really paying attention to what was happening on screen, because I was too distracted wondering how I was hearing everything I was hearing from a relatively tiny speaker directly in front of me.\n\nAs it turns out, this wouldn't work if I had the speaker placed just about anywhere. The demo used Opsodis' \"narrow mode,\" one of three audio modes the speaker is capable of. Narrow mode is the stronger spatial audio experience, but requires the speaker to be placed close and directly in front of the user: specifically, 60 centimeters away, or 23.62 inches. \"Wide mode,\" which I didn't try, offers a \"softer\" spatial audio experience, while the third mode simulates standard stereo audio.\n\nWhile this won't necessarily offer a movie theater-like experience just by placing it in front of your TV, this was some of the most fun I had at CES Unveiled tonight.",

    "fullText": "In an Ashes series riddled with low-quality cricket, England's Jamie Smith managed to find new depths.\n\nSmith's dismissal on the second morning of the fifth Test against Australia was called \"one of the worst I have ever seen\" by BBC chief cricket commentator Jonathan Agnew.\n\nFormer England fast bowler Steven Finn, commentating on TNT, said it was \"completely brainless\".\n\nWith lunch approaching in Sydney and Australia attempting to burgle some overs to hasten the second new ball, the hosts asked Marnus Labuschagne to bowl some of his very occasional medium-pace.\n\nSmith had moved to a sketchy 46. His partnership with Joe Root - unbeaten with a masterful century - was worth 94.\n\nAustralia, without a specialist spinner, were employing the part-time off-breaks of Travis Head at the other end.\n\nLabuschagne had 13 previous Test wickets to his name, all taken bowling spin. He laid a blatant trap, with seven fielders back for him to bowl some gentle bouncers.\n\n\"We better describe this field, because it is remarkable,\" said Agnew on Test Match Special. \"Marnus Labuschagne usually bowls wrist-spin but is being employed here as a bouncer bowler. And there is nobody within reach of the batsman.\n\n\"You cannot be bounced out by Marnus Labuschagne in a Test match! This is just a bizarre passage of play.\"\n\nSomehow, Smith obliged. From the fourth ball Labuschagne bowled, the England wicketkeeper stepped back and attempted a flat-batted swipe.\n\nHe succeeded in picking out Scott Boland, the only fielder in front of square on the off-side, at cover.",

    "description": "The Jets finished out a dismal season with another blowout loss, this time losing to the Buffalo Bills, 35-8.",
    "fullText": "The final game ever at Highmark Stadium had an unusual preseason-esque vibe to it with Buffalo prioritizing resting key contributors ahead of the postseason and the Jets knowing that an upset win would cost them the opportunity to pick second in the NFL draft. However, despite quarterback Josh Allen only playing the first snap, the Bills never looked in danger of losing with veteran Mitchell Trubisky at the helm.\n\nBuffalo marched 80 yards on their first possession, which ended on Trubisky’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Dawson Knox, then doubled their lead on a six-yard run by former Jets running back Ty Johnson.\n\nAfter the Jets turned the ball over on downs near midfield, the Bills quickly increased the lead to 21-0 on a two-yard pass from Trubisky to Ray Davis, who also rushed for 151 yards.\n\nMidway through the third quarter Trubisky threw another touchdown pass to Gabe Davis and a two-point conversion to Keon Coleman to make it 29-0.\n\nJohnson second touchdown, on Trubisky’s fourth touchdown pass, extended the lead to 35-0 with 12 minutes remaining, this time with the two-point conversion unsuccessful.\n\nNew York had the last word as they finally managed to get on the board with 7:33 to go, on a short touchdown pass from Brady Cook to Andrew Beck. Cook also found undrafted rookie Quinton Skinner for the two-point conversion.\n\n-- While it might be considered embarrassing for the Jets to struggle against a Bills team that was mostly backups, it’s fair to note that much of New York’s defense was comprised of third and fourth-stringers. Four of the five starters in the secondary were Ja’Sir Taylor, Keidron Smith, Tre Brown and Samuel Womack. Taylor was acquired at the trade deadline and mostly used on special teams until last week and the other three have been signed or elevated from the practice squad in the past week or two.\n\n-- Two more undrafted rookies, who had been starting in the secondary – Dean Clark and Jordan Clark – did not start, so were presumably benched in favor of the above quartet, none of whom are rookies. That perhaps reflects their own struggles in recent weeks.\n\n-- The Bills moved effortlessly downfield in 11 plays on their opening drive, mostly by running the ball, but scored on a pass play as Knox was left all alone by a coverage bust, which appeared to be Taylor’s fault, although Quincy Williams also left a receiver completely uncovered. You aren’t going to stop any NFL team, even with their reserves in, if you have defensive breakdowns like that.\n\n-- The Jets didn’t start the game any better on offense as they went three-and-out on their first two possessions. That included a play where they were flagged for having 12 men in the huddle on the first series.\n\n-- New York became the first team in NFL history not to register an interception for an entire season and also set the all-time record for fewest defensive turnovers ever in a season. Brown had a potential interception deflect off his hands on Buffalo’s second drive and Williams dropped one in the third quarter. A Jets fumble recovery was also overturned by replay review.\n\n-- Cook may at some point be a solid backup or fringe starter, but the undrafted rookie has clearly been overmatched for the past month and it’s unclear whether throwing him into this situation will benefit him in the long run. While the Jets were even more undermanned than usual at the skill positions with Breece Hall and Isaiah Davis unavailable, Cook was still playing behind a full-strength offensive line, and his lack of production reflects his limitations. He ended up with just 60 passing yards on 22 attempts.\n\n-- It’s difficult to cite any bright spots from the Jets, who were outgained by 470 yards to 122 and didn’t register a single quarterback hit. However, Womack had seven tackles and a nice pass breakup in the end zone. He also would have had a fumble recovery if the runner hadn’t been ruled down. Womack was elevated from the practice squad yesterday so if he impressed the coaches, he would need to be signed to a futures deal tomorrow.\n\n-- The Jets ultimately lost each of their last five games by 23 points or more, as they were not remotely competitive down the stretch. This does not reflect well on the coaching staff, even though they can point to the personnel limitations which caused them to be so overmatched each week, and the previous few months where they were competitive and even won three of five at one point. This could mean the coaches have a shorter leash in the event of a slow start with a retooled roster next season.\n\nTrubisky picked apart the Jets’ inexperienced secondary, which didn’t exactly make things difficult for him, but it was an efficient performance as he completed 22 of 29 passes for 259 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nBrady Cook ➡️ Andrew Beck to get the Jets on the board pic.twitter.com/j96ZZIvk62\n\n— Jets Videos (@snyjets) January 5, 2026\n\nAttention now turns to the offseason with the draft and free agency on the horizon.",

The game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET with the AFC North title on the line. The Ravens are a 3.5-point road favorite heading into the matchup.\n\nThe big news for this matchup is that Baltimore will have Lamar Jackson back at QB.

The Ravens would have been an underdog in this matchup if Jackson couldn’t go.\n\nThe Ravens have to win to secure the AFC North and the accompanying playoff berth. They are 8-8 and win would improve them to 9-8. The Steelers are 9-7 and a loss would drop them to 9-8. A Ravens win would even the season series but give Baltimore the division record tiebreaker.\n\nThe winner of the game will secure the No. 4 seed in the playoffs.

    "description": "The Sporting Tribune's Fernando Ramirez writes about the grit from Jim Harbaugh's squad and how all eyes are on New England now.",
    "fullText": "The Chargers lost to the Denver Broncos 19–3 to finish the 2025–26 season with an 11–6 record, identical to last season.\n\nSunday was about going into Denver, playing the game, and getting out healthy before the playoffs begin next weekend. For the most part, the Chargers accomplished all three.\n\nJim Harbaugh’s decision to prioritize health proved to be the correct move, as the Chargers sat several key players including Justin Herbert, Derwin James, Khalil Mack, Quentin Johnston, Ladd McConkey, and Daiyan Henley, among others.\n\nThe Chargers will now travel to New England to face the second-place AFC Patriots in the Wild Card round. It sets up a Justin Herbert vs. Drake Maye and Jim Harbaugh vs. Mike Vrabel matchup in Round 1.\n\nDespite the loss, the Chargers’ backups gave the Broncos’ starters some trouble.\n\nWith Herbert sitting, Trey Lance (20-for-44, 136 yards, one interception) made the start. It wasn’t pretty, but it was just the sixth start of his NFL career.\n\nOn the Broncos’ opening drive, Bo Nix (14-for-23, 141 passing yards, 49 rushing yards) moved the offense down the field, hitting Pat Bryant for a 9-yard gain on 3rd-and-6 from their own 30. On the next play, Nix scrambled for 22 yards to the Chargers’ 39. Runs by RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin picked up a combined 21 yards before the drive stalled on a 3-yard loss by Tyler Badie, as cornerback Tarheeb Still sniffed out the play. Broncos kicker Will Lutz connected on a 24-yard field goal to give Denver a 3–0 lead.\n\nThe Chargers’ second drive was ugly—really ugly. On 3rd-and-5 from their own 40, Lance threw a pass to KeAndre Lambert-Smith, but the rookie receiver popped the ball up to Ja’Quan McMillian, who returned it for a touchdown to make it 10–0.\n\nJan 4, 2026; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos cornerback Ja'quan McMillian (29) celebrates with teammates after scoring a touchdown against the Los Angeles Chargers during the first half at Empower Field at Mile High.\n\nOffense was a struggle for both teams. The Chargers had three drives of 13 plays, while Denver had three drives of 15 plays, but neither team scored again until just before halftime.\n\nLance opened the Chargers’ next scoring drive with an 11-yard scramble, followed by a series of short passes to move the chains. He completed four passes to Keenan Allen for 17 yards—enough for Allen to earn a $250,000 bonus by reaching 750 receiving yards on the season. Lance also found tight end Oronde Gadsden for six yards and hit Lambert-Smith for an 18-yard gain while covered by Patrick Surtain. Cameron Dicker knocked through a 30-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 10–3 at halftime.\n\nComing out of the break, the Broncos’ offense stalled with a three-and-out, which the Chargers matched.\n\nNix generated some momentum on Denver’s next drive with a 37-yard catch-and-run to tight end Evan Engram. However, after a run for no gain by Harvey and two incompletions, Lutz converted a 26-yard field goal to extend the lead to 13–3.\n\nAfter two Chargers punts and one Broncos punt, Nix faced 3rd-and-1 from his own 28. He handed the ball to Harvey, but undrafted rookie linebacker Marlowe Wax shot through and made the stop for a one-yard loss.\n\nThe Chargers got the ball back at their own 24 when Nik Bonitto strip-sacked Lance, with Denver recovering. The Chargers’ defense responded, as defensive tackle Justin Eboigbe recorded one of his two sacks on 3rd-and-11 from the 21 to force a 41-yard Lutz field goal, pushing the score to 16–3.\n\nJan 4, 2026; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos linebacker Nik Bonitto (15) hits Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Trey Lance (5) during the third quarter at Empower Field at Mile High.\n\nThe Bolts continued to show fight, particularly on defense. With defensive coordinator Jesse Minter’s name circulating as a head coaching candidate, performances like this only strengthen his résumé.\n\nDenver secured the No. 1 seed and will receive a bye, while the Chargers head to New England—a team they have never beaten in three previous playoff matchups.\n\nThe Chargers did suffer injuries to cornerback Donte Jackson, receiver KeAndre Lambert-Smith, safety Kendall Williamson, and edge rusher Bud Dupree, all of whom left the game.\n\nThose injuries will be worth monitoring, especially Jackson’s, as he is arguably the Chargers’ best cornerback.\n\nStill, the Chargers are back in the playoffs. With several key players getting much-needed rest, they should be ready for their Wild Card matchup against the Patriots.",

    "fullText": "UConn Men’s basketball four wins away from program history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe No. 4 UConn men’s basketball team is not only dominating the regular season, but it is also chasing history. The Huskies recently set a modern-era NCAA Tournament record with 13 consecutive March Madness wins, a streak that began during their 2023 national championship run and continued through the 2025 tournament before ending in the Round of 32. That achievement tied Duke’s historic mark from 1991–93 and further cemented UConn’s status as one of college basketball’s elite programs.\n\nNow, the Huskies are closing in on another major milestone. With their current winning streak, UConn needs three more victories to tie the longest winning streak in program history. Upcoming matchups against Providence, DePaul, and Seton Hall will decide if the Huskies can reach that mark. If UConn defeats Georgetown after that stretch, it would set a new program record for most consecutive wins.\n\nUConn continued its impressive run Sunday afternoon with a 73–57 wire-to-wire win over Marquette at Gampel Pavilion. The Huskies never trailed and earned their 10th straight victory, improving to 14–1 overall and 4–0 in BIG EAST play.\n\nThe win matched UConn’s best start through 15 games under head coach Dan Hurley and marked the fourth straight season the Huskies have posted a winning streak of at least 10 games.\n\nSolo Ball led UConn with 17 points and added a season-high eight rebounds, along with a steal and a block in a strong all-around performance. Silas Demary Jr. finished with 14 points despite dealing with foul trouble, while Tarris Reed Jr. contributed 13 points and nine rebounds, just missing a double-double.\n\nFrom the opening tip, UConn set the tone with physical defense and strong play in the paint. Back-to-back dunks and consistent interior scoring helped the Huskies build a double-digit lead in the first half. A late basket by Reed sent UConn into halftime ahead 37–29.\n\nThe second half belonged to the Huskies. UConn opened with a quick scoring run, highlighted by a three-pointer from Ball, and stretched the lead to as many as 20 points. Marquette struggled to find any offensive rhythm, shooting just over 32 percent from the field.\n\nDefense and rebounding were key to the victory. UConn finished with a 49–37 advantage on the boards, controlled second-chance opportunities, and blocked eight shots as a team. Jaylin Stewart, Alex Karaban, and freshman Eric Reibe all made important contributions, especially on defense. Reibe continued his steady play by grabbing at least five rebounds for the eighth time this season.\n\nWith the win, UConn has now defeated Marquette six straight times and remains unbeaten in BIG EAST play. As the Huskies prepare to face Providence next, they continue to build momentum and move closer to making program history.\n\nRick Pitino reacts to St. John’s opening win\n\nOhio State loses point guard commitment\n\nAJ Dybansta makes debut for BYU\n\nJalen Rose on TNT college basketball coverage",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys wrapped up their 2025 season on Sunday and will now turn all of their attention to offseason work in the name of not finding themselves out of the playoffs this time next year. Obviously that is much easier said than done.\n\nThis upcoming offseason is one of the most important and critical in recent Cowboys history as they have multiple first-round draft picks for the first time since 2008. With the Cowboys now officially done for the season, we know where they will be picking come the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHere are the first 12 picks of the draft, through the Cowboys selection at number 12 overall, courtesy of Tankathon.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar it is because it is… the Cowboys held the 12th overall pick last year and used it to select Tyler Booker. They also used it in 2021 to select Micah Parsons, more on him in a moment, although they picked it up after trading back two spots. For what it’s worth the Detroit Lions held the pick in consecutive seasons beginning the year after and landed Jameson Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs, so hopefully that type of success is what the Cowboys find.\n\nWhile we know where the Cowboys are picking, it is still unknown exactly where their other first-round pick will land. Dallas holds Green Bay’s selection in the 2026 NFL Draft and the Packers are currently set to visit the Chicago Bears in the Wild Card Round which means we are all rooting for Chicago to take care of business.\n\nKeep in mind that Dallas has also already dealt away 2026 draft capital as well.\n\n2nd: Dealt away in Quinnen Williams trade\n\n3rd: Dealt away in George Pickens trade\n\n6th: Dealt away in Jordan Phillips trade with New York Giants in early 2024, also received a 7th that was sent to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Logan Wilson\n\n7th (Kansas City’s): Acquired from the Chiefs when Dallas sent them Peyton Hendershot in early 2024\n\n7th (their own): Dealt away when Dallas traded for Kaiir Elam in early 2025\n\nThe Cowboys are projected to receive a couple of compensatory picks as well, potentially in the fifth-round, but those are not fully known at this time.",

He visited UF over the weekend along with teammate and wide receiver Bailey Stockwell.\n\nA redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo showed promise as a backup quarterback in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets, throwing for 938 yards with 2 TDs to 3 interceptions over two seasons while rushing for 95 yards and 1 TD. Philo has appeared in seven games over two seasons and while alternating with starter Haynes King, helped lead Georgia Tech to a 28-23 upset win over Miami on Nov. 9, 2024.\n\nA three-star recruit out of Prince Andrew Christian School in Bogart, Ga., Philo broke Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence's high school record for passing yards in the state of Georgia with 13,922 yards during his prep career.\n\nPhilo will compete with redshirt freshman Tramel Jones Jr. for the starting quarterback job at Florida. Jones, who announced his intention to return to UF in December, completed 21 of 35 passes for 191 yards and 2 TDs in two games as former UF quarterback DJ Lagway's backup last season. Florida also brings back redshirt sophomore quarterback Aidan Warner and adds incoming four-star freshman quarterback Will Griffin, who plans to enroll at UF this month for the spring semester.\n\nPhilo joins Baylor safety DJ Coleman as the second commitment in UF's 2026 transfer portal class.\n\nKevin Brockway is The Gainesville Sun’s Florida beat writer.

In overtime, it was Sidney Crosby who scored the winner to help Pittsburgh get its fifth-straight win.\n\n“It felt great,” Rakell said postgame on Sunday. “We were pushing throughout the whole period there, and we felt like we were close so many times. But their goalie (Jet Greaves) played a really good game for them, and didn’t make it easy for us. But everybody on our team did such a good job tonight.”\n\nRakell believes the Penguins are coming together as a team, and the winning streak is a big part of it.\n\n“I think I just like our whole team game,” Rakell said. “Everybody knows that they’re very important part of us having success, and when everybody is doing their job every night, I think it gives us a good chance to win.”\n\nWith the win, the Penguins improved to 20-12-9 and are holding onto the top Wild Card spot. It was a great comeback win, which Pittsburgh believes can propel them.\n\n“It’s a great response by us,” goaltender Arturs Silovs said. “Guys are flying, we’re shooting, producing a lot of shots. Started to win a lot of offensive position, getting the changes and outworking them, and get rewarded.”\n\nPittsburgh will return to the ice on Thursday at home against the New Jersey Devils.\n\nMore Penguins: Dan Muse Praises Newly-Acquired Yegor Chinakhov After Recording First Penguins Goal\n\nThe post Sidney Crosby Helps Penguins Complete Comeback To Extend Win Streak appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "Moral injury—psychological harm incurred from committing, witnessing, or being subject to actions that violate one’s moral code—has officially been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), thanks to research led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The APA included “moral problem” in the newest version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the handbook for classifying and diagnosing mental health conditions used by U.S. mental health care providers.\n\nIn a Sept. 16 Psychology Today article, Tyler VanderWeele, John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology and director of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard (HFH), and Jennifer Wortham, a research associate at HFH, described their research on moral injury and subsequent work with the APA.\n\n“Over the past several years, [HFH has] been trying to develop a more unified approach to moral injury and to moral distress that would be applicable to perpetrators, witnesses, and victims,” they wrote. “After months of synthesis of prior work, we defined ‘moral distress’ as ‘distress that arises because personal experience disrupts or threatens: (a) one’s sense of the goodness of oneself, of others, of institutions, or of what are understood to be higher powers, or (b) one’s beliefs or intuitions about right and wrong, or good and evil.’ When that distress became sufficiently persistent it would constitute ‘moral injury.’”\n\nVanderWeele and Wortham introduced this definition, and the research behind it, in a March 4 Frontiers in Psychology study. The study sparked collaboration with the APA to ensure that moral injury was incorporated into the DSM.\n\n“Our hope is that [inclusion in the DSM] opens important opportunities for awareness and treatment of moral trauma, moral distress, and moral injury,” VanderWeele and Wortham wrote in the Psychology Today article. “If we are to truly provide person-centered care, the very real possibility of moral distress and moral injury needs to be acknowledged. The present recognition within psychiatry is a step forward in this regard.”\n\nRead the study: Moral trauma, moral distress, moral injury, and moral injury disorder: definitions and assessments\n\nRead the Psychology Today article: The Importance of Recognizing Moral Trauma in Clinical Care\n\nRead an HFH press release: DSM recognizes moral injury, thanks to Human Flourishing Program research\n\nMedia Relations Manager in the Office of Communications",

    "description": "The US's highly elite but secretive Delta Force captures and eliminates high-value targets. They reportedly helped capture Venezuela's Maduro.",
    "fullText": "At the center of the US operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife was an elite and secretive special operations group, per multiple reports.\n\nCiting officials, outlets like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Delta Force, alongside law enforcement personnel, carried out the extraction of Maduro as part of Operation Absolute Resolve, a surprise nighttime raid of the Venezuelan leader's compound in Caracas.\n\nBusiness Insider wasn't able to independently confirm the participation of the elite unit in the operation. The Pentagon directed BI's queries to the White House.\n\nIn discussions of the complex operation, President Donald Trump said only that it was executed by \"the most highly trained soldiers in the world,\" adding that \"there's nobody that has their talent.\"\n\nThe president may have been speaking about all of the personnel involved. US officials said that the operation to grab Maduro included land, air, sea, space, cyber, and intelligence forces. But Trump's language could easily apply to Delta Force, a top-tier special operations unit.\n\nHere is what we know about this elite force.\n\nDelta Force, officially known as the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (SFOD-D), is tasked with capturing and eliminating high-value targets. Like other tier-one special mission units, such as SEAL Team 6, Delta Force tackles some of the US Army's most covert and complex tasks.\n\nThe special operations unit, founded by Col. Charlie Beckwith in the 1970s for direct combat action, unconventional warfare, and counterterrorism, is headquartered at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, also home to other Army special operations forces.\n\nOperators train for rapid infiltration and exfiltration, intense close-quarters combat, precision marksmanship, demolition, hostage rescue, and more. Unlike some other units, Delta pulls the best warfighters it can from across the US armed forces, though it mainly draws from Army special operations forces. Known as \"quiet professionals,\" Delta Force operators generally do not speak openly about their activities.\n\nMuch of the elite force's work is highly classified, but some Delta missions are public knowledge.\n\nDelta Force was involved in the US operation, Just Cause, that ultimately led to the capture of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega during the 1989 invasion of Panama. And the group distinguished itself during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, made famous by the book and film \"Black Hawk Down.\" Two snipers were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions.\n\nThis century, this unit was among the US special operations forces that surged into Afghanistan immediately after the 9/11 attacks, played a role in the 2003 capture of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and was involved in the death of the infamous Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019.\n\nAnd now reporting indicates Delta Force, along with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, was instrumental in capturing Maduro.\n\nThe US president and other US officials shared details of the raid that captured Maduro on Saturday.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the apprehension team broke into a fortified compound to capture Maduro after months of planning. US intelligence agencies watched and studied his patterns of life, while other teams trained for the operation on a replica of Maduro's home. The US used a similar tactic to ready for the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound.\n\nReports indicate Delta Force was inserted into the target area by the 160th SOAR, the Night Stalkers famous for their ability to get special operators in and out of tough spots.\n\nWith fighters, bombers, electronic warfare planes, and more delivering strikes and providing air cover, Caine said the helicopters carrying the extraction team were able to reach their target with \"totally the element of surprise.\"\n\nDuring the complex apprehension operation, American operators moved fast through the building to find Maduro and his wife, seizing them before they could get the door closed on a steel safe room.\n\nTrump said that Venezuela's military was overwhelmed by US forces. Several American personnel were injured, the president said, and one of the helicopters was hit but remained flyable. No troops or equipment were lost in the operation.\n\nThe Trump administration is holding Maduro responsible for supporting narco-terrorism (drug trafficking) and other criminal activity. The recent operation is also about oil, with the administration accusing Venezuela of using oil revenue to fund malign activities. Maduro has denied the allegations.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that the US would run Venezuela until a \"safe, proper\" election could occur. He also said that US oil companies would be entering the country, which has the world's largest proven crude oil reserves.\n\nTo secure these operations, he said that he's not ruling out putting US troops on the ground. He said the US military is ready to conduct more attacks if needed.\n\nUS Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro and his wife were charged in New York with drug and weapons offenses. He is due to appear in court.",

    "title": "I left McKinsey in my 20s for startup life. Being a founder taught me to stop overanalyzing and speak up more.",
    "description": "A former McKinsey consultant shares what he had to unlearn from consulting to succeed in startup life.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nathan Wangliao Yinan, the CEO and cofounder of Singapore-based AI startup Havana. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment history.\n\nAfter university, I didn't have the risk appetite to start something immediately. I joined McKinsey in the UK in 2018 because they actively encouraged me to do something different after two years there.\n\nI was at McKinsey for slightly under three years. I met a lot of people who were from different walks of life, and that made me feel it's OK to go and do different things.\n\nMy first manager had been a doctor in the UK who left practice because she felt the healthcare system was broken. She joined McKinsey to do healthcare work. One of my favorite bosses had been in the US Marines and went to Iraq. He did an MBA and joined the firm after that.\n\nI moved back to Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and McKinsey became less fun because everything was remote. The thing I enjoyed most — the people — began to decline.\n\nI knew I wanted to start something, but I realized I was pushing it off because it was hard to make a move during the pandemic. At some point, it felt like I was doing my job out of inertia.\n\nI left McKinsey in 2021 at the age of 27 and worked at a Singapore-based AI startup for two years, leading the go-to-market strategy.\n\nI went from being in a huge office with all kinds of perks to being in a coworking space with just two other people, and we had to figure everything out from scratch.\n\nI told my founder in the first month, \"Maybe I should just go back to McKinsey because this feels too scary.\" I don't know if the company will be around in a year. What if I need to look for a job?\n\nA lot of it is irrational because, honestly, we raised a lot of money, and we were a good company, and I'm sure I could find a job.\n\nThe startup was acquired in 2023, and I cofounded Havana, a startup specializing in AI agents for student recruitment and enrollment teams.\n\nI was told that the most important and hardest thing in a startup is managing my own psychology.\n\nIt's not learning how to build a new product or how to sell. If you are able to manage your psychology, then you will have the morale to learn all these things. As long as you work hard and you're capable, anyone can figure these things out. Most people, at some point, lose morale, or they just feel like it sucks too much.\n\nThere are a lot of things that can distract you. You can think, \"Oh, my other friends are doing X, Y, Z, and their life seems easier.\" You have to learn to shut down these distracting thoughts when you are in a career with a lot of openness and uncertainty.\n\nThe most important skill I learned at McKinsey is how to navigate clients.\n\nTypically, they are more senior and older than us. They have multiple departments, and you need to know how to run a meeting efficiently and understand everyone's needs. The startup that I'm running now sells to universities, which are bigger than us, so that's a useful skill.\n\nConsulting also trained me to be organized and structured. I learned to prioritize ruthlessly and do things fast because timelines are always tight.\n\nThere are also some things I had to unlearn. Consultants are trained to overanalyze and rely on data to figure out the most optimal solution. That's OK for big companies.\n\nIn a startup, when you're trying to make decisions, you'll never have enough data. You just have to have the guts to do one thing. If it doesn't work, go and do the second thing.\n\nWhen I first left consulting, I struggled with that. I would take a bit too long to try to get data, talk to more people, and read more books before choosing the right path.\n\nEarly on, we conducted customer interviews before building the product. My cofounder and I would spend a lot of time discussing: Is this the pain point we want to solve? Does this feel big enough? What's the first version of the product we should build?\n\nIt's very ambiguous, like trying to get some kind of instinct through research. Over time, we began building the product and attracting customers, and then a bit more rhythm emerged.\n\nNow, I don't feel like I have to have all the knowledge. I'm comfortable taking risks and making decisions.\n\nAs a startup founder, I've also gotten a lot more comfortable with speaking more. When I was at McKinsey, my managers would say I needed to speak up \n\nIf you run a business and are the only non-technical founder, you have to talk to customers every day. They expect you to show up with a point of view.\n\nDo you have a story to share about building a tech business in Asia? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

Maduro has been indicted on drug trafficking and weapons charges and is now awaiting his first hearing in a notorious Brooklyn jail.\n\nIn a press conference on Saturday, though, Trump said that with Maduro removed from the country, the US would now look to tap the country's oil reserves.\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump called Venezuela's oil business a \"bust\" and \"nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping, and what could have taken place.\"\n\nWhile it's home to a fifth of the world's oil reserves, Venezuela accounts for less than 1% of global daily crude production.\n\nTake a look at how its reserves compare to other countries.

    "description": "Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a complicated relationship. They've had some very public spats, but the two powerful men remain political allies.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump appear to be back on after an on-again, off-again relationship over the years.\n\nThe world's richest person and the two-time president of the United States weren't always close, but became singular political allies, with Musk calling himself \"first buddy\" following Trump's 2024 victory and donating more than $200 million toward pro-Trump super PACs.\n\nAt the beginning of Trump's second term, Musk was frequently seen on the president's side and served as the de facto head of the White House DOGE office.\n\nIn June 2025, Trump and Musk's relationship blew up after Musk criticized Trump's signature \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Musk even threatened to start his own political party. Trump threatened to \"destroy\" Musk's companies.\n\nTensions have cooled since then. Musk and Trump shook hands at Charlie Cook's memorial service in September, a reunion that Musk and the White House proudly shared on social media. In October 2025, Trump said he now had a \"good\" relationship with Musk.\n\n\"I like Elon, I've always liked him,\" Trump said.\n\nHere's how the two billionaires reached this point.\n\nJust before the 2016 presidential election, Musk told CNBC he didn't think Trump should be president.\n\n\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire added that Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies were the \"right ones.\"\n\nAfter he won the presidency, Trump appointed Musk to two economic advisory councils, along with other business leaders like then Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nMusk received criticism for working with the controversial president, but he defended his choice by saying he was using the position to lobby for better environmental and immigration policies.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, after Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Musk resigned from his roles on presidential advisory boards.\n\n\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk said in a tweet announcing his departure.\n\nMusk's goal for Tesla is to curb dependence on fossil fuels through electric vehicles, solar power, and stationary energy storage.\n\nDuring a January 2020 interview with CNBC, Trump praised Musk's accomplishments and intelligence.\n\n\"You have to give him credit,\" the former president said, referring to Tesla becoming more valuable than Ford and General Motors. \"He's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And he's doing good at rockets too, by the way.\"\n\nTrump called Musk \"one of our great geniuses\" and likened him to Thomas Edison.\n\nAs the pandemic gripped the US in early 2020, Musk clashed with California public-health officials who forced Tesla to temporarily shut down its factory there. Trump voiced his support for Musk.\n\n\"California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,\" Trump tweeted in May 2020. \"It can be done Fast & Safely!\"\n\nIn May 2022, Musk said he would unban Trump as Twitter's new owner.\n\nMusk called the ban a \"morally bad decision\" and \"foolish to the extreme\" in an interview with the Financial Times. Twitter kicked Trump off its platform following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire has called himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" and one of his key goals for taking Twitter private was to loosen content moderation.\n\nIn July 2022, Trump took aim at Musk, saying the businessman voted for him but later denied it.\n\n\"You know [Musk] said the other day 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican,'\" Trump said during a Saturday rally in Anchorage, Alaska. \"I said 'I didn't know that.' He told me he voted for me. So he's another bullshit artist.\"\n\nDays later, Musk tweeted that Trump's claim was \"not true.\"\n\nMusk stopped short of attacking Trump personally, but said he shouldn't run for president again.\n\n\"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset. Dems should also call off the attack – don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe continued: \"Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!? Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.\" Trump is 76 years old.\n\nSoon after, Trump went on the offensive, posting a lengthy attack on Musk on Truth Social.\n\n\"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he'd be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump said in a post that criticized two of Musk's ventures, Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\n\"Lmaooo,\" Musk responded on Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk's official purchase of Twitter in October 2022, Trump applauded the deal.\n\n\"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country,\" he said. He added that he likes Truth Social better than other platforms, echoing comments from earlier this year in which he ruled out a return to Twitter.\n\nMusk later joked about the potential of welcoming the former president back to his newly acquired platform.\n\n\"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!,\" the Tesla CEO tweeted in October 2022.\n\nMusk and other right-leaning voices in Silicon Valley initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis ended 2022 as Trump's best-positioned primary challenger. In November 2022, as DeSantis was skyrocketing to acclaim, Musk said he would endorse him. In March 2023, after enduring Trump's attacks for months, DeSantis prepared to make history by formally announcing his candidacy in an interview on Twitter.\n\nThe initial few minutes were a glitchy disaster. Trump and his allies ruthlessly mocked DeSantis' \"Space\" with Musk and venture capitalist David Sachs. DeSantis' interview later proceeded, but his campaign was dogged for days with negative headlines.\n\nMusk live-streamed a visit to the US-Mexico border on Twitter, which he had rebranded as \"X.\" Musk offered his support for one of Trump's signature immigration policies.\n\n\"We actually do need a wall and we need to require people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter, as everyone is doing that,\" Musk wrote on X. \"It's a hack that you can literally Google to know exactly what to say! Will find out more when I visit Eagle Pass maybe as soon as tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump tried to woo Musk during a meeting at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. According to The New York Times, Trump met with Musk and a few other GOP megadonors when the former president's campaign was particularly cash-strapped. After the Times published its report, Musk said he would not be \"donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nMusk said he \"fully endorsed\" Trump after the former president was shot during a political rally ahead of the Republican National Convention. Musk's endorsement marked a major turning point in his yearslong political evolution from an Obama voter. Days later, it would come to light that Musk pressed Trump to select Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nTrump announced Vance as his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe ticket, Musk wrote on X, \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nTrump, who ended the Republican National Convention primed for victory, stumbled after Biden abruptly dropped out of the 2024 race. He and his allies have struggled to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAmid Harris' early media blitz, Trump joined Musk on a two-hour livestream on X that garnered an audience of over 1 million listeners. The conversation covered topics ranging from a retelling of Trump's assassination attempt to illegal immigration to Musk's potential role with a government efficiency commission.\n\nIn August, Trump began to suggest that he \"certainly would\" consider adding Musk to his Cabinet or an advisory role. The Tesla CEO responded by tweeting an AI-generated photo of himself on a podium emblazoned with the acronym \"D.O.G.E\"—Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"I am willing to serve,\" he wrote above the image.\n\nIn September 2024, Trump softened the possibility that Musk might join his Cabinet suggestion of Musk joining his Cabinet. However, he also said that Musk could \"consult with the country\" and help give \"some very good ideas.\"\n\nMusk later expressed enthusiasm about the news.\n\n\"I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe later added that he \"looked forward to serving\" the country and would be willing to do with without any pay, title, or recognition.\n\nMusk joined Trump onstage during the former president's rally, hosted on October 5 in the same location where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024. Musk sported an all-black \"Make America Great Again\" cap and briefly addressed the crowd, saying that voter turnout for Trump this year was essential or \"this will be the last election.\"\n\n\"President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution,\" Musk said. \"He must win to preserve democracy in America.\"\n\nThe next day, Musk's America PAC announced that it would offer $47 to each person who refers registered voters residing in swing states to sign a petition \"in support for the First and Second Amendments.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO later told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he might face \"vengeance\" if Trump loses the election.\n\nMusk was by Trump's side on election night at Mar-a-Lago, helping celebrate his victory.\n\nNearly a week after his 2024 presidential election win, Trump announced that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy were chosen to lead a newly minted Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE, as Musk liked to call it, in reference to the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin).\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pay the way for my Administration to dismantle the Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nOutside of administrative duties, Musk's presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club was so constant that Trump joked he couldn't \"get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Elon won't go home,\" Trump told NBC News jokingly\n\nThe pair's close relationship grew into a more personal friendship. Musk was seen attending Trump's Thanksgiving dinner and on the golf course with Trump and his grandchildren, where Kai Trump said he achieved \"uncle status.\"\n\nTrump dismissed concerns that Musk would be running the country, adding in a barb that the billionaire couldn't even be in charge if he wanted to, since he was born in South Africa.\n\n\"No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump said in December 2024. \"And I'm safe. You know why? He can't be? He wasn't born in this country.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after Musk flexed his influence to help shut down a bipartisan emergency spending bill earlier that month. Some Republicans questioned why Trump hadn't been more active in derailing the bill, and Democrats baited the President-elect on social media with posts about Musk \"calling the shots\" and taking on the role of a \"shadow president.\n\nTrump was sworn into office on January 20. Several tech leaders were in attendance, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The \"first buddy\" was also front and center for Trump's inauguration.\n\nMusk took the stage to celebrate at an inauguration event at the Capital One Arena, where he sparked accusations over a gesture he made that some said resembled a Nazi salute. Musk denied the allegations.\n\n\"Hopefully, people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi,\" he said during an interview with Joe Rogan.\n\nThough Musk quickly became the face of the DOGE effort, White House court filings said he had \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"\n\nIn the February 2025 filing, Musk was described as a senior advisor to Trump with \"no greater authority than other senior White House advisors.\" Officials also called him a \"special government employee.\"\n\nTrump told reporters they can call Musk \"whatever you want.\"\n\nThe White House later named Amy Gleason, who previously worked for US Digital Service, as the acting DOGE administrator.\n\nMusk's companies struggled to escape the almost daily DOGE-related news cycles.\n\nProtests, boycotts, and vandalism at Tesla dealerships spread across the US.\n\nIn March, Trump stepped in to defend Musk's electric car company, with Teslas on the South Lawn of the White House. Trump later wrote that he'd purchased a Tesla to show support for Musk.\n\n\"The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThree months into DOGE's mission to reshape the federal workforce, Musk announced that he would be stepping back from the effort. He broke the news during an underwhelming Tesla earnings call, where earnings per share were down 71% year over year.\n\n\"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" Musk said during the call. He added that \"the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency\" had been completed.\n\nAt the time, Musk said he would keep spending one or two days each week on governmental duties, so long as Trump wanted him to do so.\n\nOn June 30, Musk doubled down on his calls for another political party. He also vowed to defeat politicians who support Trump's bill.\n\n\"They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,\" Musk wrote on X.\n\nTrump responded on July 1 on Truth Social, suggesting that DOGE could be turned on its former chief.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk followed up with more posts on X proclaiming his opposition to the spending bill.\n\nTrump signed his signature bill on July 4, 2025.\n\nOn July 5, Musk said on X that he had formed the America Party to \"give you back your freedom.\"\n\nTrump responded on Truth Social that he was \"saddened\" to see Musk go \"completely 'off the rails,'\" essentially becoming a \"TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.\" Trump added that third political parties have never succeeded.\n\nLate in the month, Trump said that even though his signature domestic plan slashes EV subsidies, he's not out to hurt Musk's bottom line.\n\n\"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\"\n\nTrump's statement came a day after the White House appeared to suggest that federal agencies shouldn't contract with Musk's xAI.\n\nTrump and Musk were seen for the first time since their public falling out at the memorial service for conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nTrump, Vice President JD Vance, and a host of other top White House officials joined together in Arizona to pay tribute to Kirk, who was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nMusk and the White House later posted photos of the meet-up on X.\n\nTrump said that Musk came over \"to say hello.\"\n\n\"I thought it was nice, he came over, we had a little conversation,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after the memorial service. \"We had a very good relationship but it was nice that he came over. \"\n\nPOTUS x @ElonMusk \n\nFor Charlie. pic.twitter.com/Inaf8X81Gy\n\nMusk had previously said that the White House had invited him to an exclusive dinner for tech CEOs but was unable to attend.\n\nTrump said he and Musk had a \"good\" relationship and called their brief feud \"a stupid moment.\"\n\n\"He had a bad spell, he had a bad period. He had a bad moment,\" Trump told reporters when asked about their relationship. \"It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon, and I suspect I always will.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO still has beefs elsewhere. In late October, Musk called Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy a \"dummy\" amid a spat over who would lead NASA.\n\nTrump invited Musk to attend a dinner at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November. The event marks Musk's first public appearance at the White House since stepping back from the DOGE office in May 2025.\n\nThe guest list for the dinner included prominent CEOs such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk shared a photo of the event on X, which included himself, Trump, the crown prince, and Huang.\n\n\"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nOne day after the dinner, Trump joked about Musk in a speech at the US-Saudi Investment Forum.\n\n\"You're so lucky I'm with you, Elon. I'll tell you. Has he ever thanked me properly?\" Trump said.\n\nHours after news broke that the US had raided Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on January 3, Elon Musk posted his support.\n\n\"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"It is heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant,\" he posted again. \"Venezuela can now have the prosperity it deserves.\"\n\nThat same evening, Musk posted that he had a \"lovely dinner\" with Trump and Melania Trump, along with a photo of the three of them seated at a table at Mar-a-Lago.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea's stoppage-time equaliser against Manchester City on a freezing Sunday evening at Etihad Stadium felt a monumental moment in the Premier League title race.\n\nWith time ticking away, Pep Guardiola's side were edging towards a ninth consecutive top-flight home victory as they aimed to maintain the pressure on leaders Arsenal.\n\nBut City wilted late on by conceding to Enzo Fernandez's 94th-minute leveller, bundling in at the far post to leave the travelling fans delirious and the home faithful stunned at the final whistle.\n\nChelsea supporters celebrated an unlikely point wildly, during a tumultuous week in which manager Enzo Maresca departed the club, while City players' shoulders slumped, knowing they had dropped four crucial points in as many days.\n\nIt means Arsenal have been handed a major boost by moving six points clear of both City and Aston Villa having made a statement of intent by thumping Unai Emery's side during the week and edging past Bournemouth on Saturday.\n\n\"I don't have a crystal ball to look at what will happen in the future,\" said Guardiola when asked about the title race. \"The only thing I think [about] is recovering the players for Brighton on Wednesday. Of course we were closer.\n\n\"We played an incredible second half at Sunderland and today we didn't get luck but we scored a goal. Being clinical is part of all the stats. You can create chances, our expected goals is higher than everyone, but you have to do it. As the manager I said to the team, we played really good against this team.\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmi Martinez (Aston Villa): It is going to sound very strange because it was a very comfortable Aston Villa win, but he made some key saves from Morgan Gibbs-White in the second half - just after Nottingham Forest got a goal back and it went to 2-1. He just kept them in the game.\n\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa): He was excellent. He has been excellent for a few weeks now but a massive outlet for Aston Villa. When they are dominant on the ball, he's the outlet on the right-hand side and got a lovely little assist in there as well. He is the main outlet and he really jumps off the pitch when you are watching the games.\n\nMalick Thiaw (Newcastle): From November onwards, he has been exceptional. He had a tough time in Italy but he is delivering consistently now. He scores a goal, which always helps for any defender in this team of the week. Solid performance, delivered, was more aggressive and I feel like he is starting to get his bearings now and feel like he is the man at Newcastle.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): Goal and an assist with the flick-on. I just think when they first signed him from Wolves, I didn't get it. Now I do. Especially under Keith Andrews. He organises well, he moves the ball really strongly from the back. He is the leader of that team. Forget Jordan Henderson, he is the leader of that team. Obviously goals help at centre-back.\n\nBen Davies (Tottenham): I don't think this is a name I ever thought I was going to put in but Ben Davies, fair play to him. He plays only his third game of the season, starts, they had Djed Spence on the bench as well - which shows the level of professionalism and maturity that he continues to deliver - and he gets a goal. It just shows to me that you don't always have to be 37 and written off. He's 32 and he's already been written off, he's got a World Cup to hopefully go to with Wales. He is always fit and available, which is what I really like.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): Two goals, leader, future England captain - do we need to say anything else?\n\nMateus Mane (Wolves): Eighteen years old, England youth international, doesn't have any noise, hasn't got any brothers with T-shirts saying to 'free him and let him play'. He goes out, plays, scores goals, gets an assist, gets the penalty and just delivers with no fuss. How beautiful is that? No fuss. I saw his interview after the game, he doesn't complain, doesn't get too over the top, just simple. Love it.\n\nJohn McGinn (Aston Villa): He obviously has to be in here. Two goals, the second goal he is obviously buzzing because the keeper made it so easy for him - but it feels like he has had a love-hate relationship with Unai Emery for about three years now. It has started to come to fruition. He has been a really important piece for this Aston Villa side.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): He gets a goal and it probably should have been the match-winner for Man City if we are being totally honest. They will feel like they should have won that game. Reijnders has got three goals in his last four matches and that shows his importance. He is growing. He had a really good start and then I think the reality of English football caught up with him for a period, but now he has got his second wind and he is playing well. He is going to be really important if City are to try to catch Arsenal.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Like me, you probably took him out of your fantasy football team thinking he had fallen off a cliff, and then he has scored every week since. So that just basically says more about my fantasy football managerial ability more than anything to do with his performances! But he is the rock, the leader, making sure he is right up there for that conversation for Brazil with the World Cup squad. You've got Joao Pedro, Richarlison, Gabriel Jesus - these are the guys who are all being spoken about. Even Neymar, but he's the one with the most goals, he is the one delivering with the most performances week in, week out. I'm backing him to make the squad.\n\nCody Gakpo (Liverpool): It was a game where Liverpool will feel they should have won it, nicking it in the 94th minute and then obviously Fulham score in the 97th minute. I think it is just one of those moments where you look at the team and you think no Hugo Ekitike, no Alexander Isak, who is going to step up and score the goals? To be fair to him, he's done it all season and that's why he goes in.\n\nRob Edwards (Wolves): First win for Wolves, a massive game against West Ham. I think in those games, because I have played in them, you need your manager to be resolute. To get you up but not get you over the edge and I think he just had both the tactics and emotion of the game spot on. Didn't go over the needle, didn't go under it and his team obviously delivered a massive 3-0 victory which gives them a fight - because if they had lost that game, relegation would have been all done and dusted. Now, hopefully they can get another win in the week and build on that momentum. For right now, it's huge for him and thankfully it is the first time we say something positive about Wolves all season - so massive kudos to Rob and his team.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

This stadium is not a happy place – and Frank is failing to provide the style or substance to change things.",

    "fullText": "When manager Arne Slot and Liverpool look back at this season, a crazy January afternoon when they drew 2-2 at Fulham will go a long way to summing up their misfortunes.\n\nWith top scorer Hugo Ekitike out with a muscle issue, Liverpool's struggles were compounded when one of their former players Harry Wilson opened the scoring in a first half in which Slot's side failed to test home goalkeeper Bernd Leno.\n\nYet they equalised through a controversial Florian Wirtz goal - and looked to have snatched victory in the fourth minute of stoppage time when Cody Gakpo scored in front of the away end.\n\nHowever, late substitute Harrison Reed fired home a contender for goal of the season from 25 yards in the 97th minute as Slot's side dropped points again.\n\n\"Losing that game would have been completely unfair to us,\" said Fulham manager Marco Silva.\n\nLiverpool extended their unbeaten run to nine games, but yet again their problems were laid bare.\n\n\"If you're not part of Liverpool, you think you'd win it,\" said Slot. \"But unfortunately I've been experiencing this for months now that the first chance the other team gets leads to a goal. The second thing is that the other team scores a goal you don't expect in extra time. So, is it then a surprise?\" the Dutchman said.\n\nWhat did surprise many inside Craven Cottage was that Wirtz's equaliser was confirmed after a video assistant referee (VAR) check - despite replays suggesting he was in an offside position.\n\n\"I was sure it was offside so I didn't even celebrate,\" Wirtz told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I felt the same. Many people inside the stadium felt the same,\" said Silva. \"It looked offside, but we have to believe the semi-automated technology worked well and did right,\" the Fulham boss added.",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC and IBF belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.",

    "title": "How the sugar industry bought out scientists for decades",
    "description": "Researchers followed the money, and found out that the sugar industry has been gaslighting the entire world for fifty years. It was code-named \"Project 226.\"",
    "fullText": "According to a report just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a delegation from the Sugar Research Foundation paid off Harvard scientists to produce reports that falsely downplayed the role of sugar in coronary heart disease.\n\nYep. Sugar contributes to coronary artery disease, more than we have been led to believe.\n\nReports had linked both dietary sugar and dietary fat to heart disease as early as the mid-50s; by 1960 we knew that low-fat diets high in sugars still resulted in high cholesterol levels. So in 1964, the director of the SRF proposed that the group \"embark on a major program\" to dispute the data as well as any \"negative attitudes toward sugar.\" They found a group of Harvard nutrition scientists who would take their money, and started making plans.\n\nComplete with a codename, Project 226 was designed to protect the interests of the sugar industry by \"recapturing\" the 20% of American calorie intake they expected to lose once this whole sugar-isn't-great-for-your-heart thing percolated through into public awareness. It resulted in a two-part review published in the prestigious and influential New England Journal of Medicine, which hand-waved away huge swathes of research pointing out the risks of dietary sugar.\n\nThe authors went to absurd lengths to discount studies that didn't tell the story the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to tell. For example, to get the results they wanted, they had to throw out all the studies done on animals, because not a single animal study supported the conclusion they wanted. But after they finished their work, they reported that epidemiological studies showed a positive association between high dietary sugar consumption and better heart disease outcomes. The review concluded that there was \"no doubt\" that the only way to avoid heart disease was to reduce saturated fat.\n\nHow did this get past the sanity check at NEJM? The authors were experts, respected in their fields, and they were at least consistent cherry-pickers. They also conveniently failed to report that the Sugar Research Foundation funded their \"study.\" NEJM didn't start requiring authors to report conflicts of interest until 1984, and by then the sugar industry had floated comfortably on their 1964 precedent, funding study after study supporting their pro-sugar narrative \"as a main prop of the industry's defense.\"\n\nCan we finally talk about industry-funded studies? I'm not saying that scientists shouldn't be able to work for private research establishments. Obviously the money to buy the pipettes and reagents has to come from somewhere. But I am saying that there needs to be an unpleasantly bright spotlight on the financial resources enabling the scientific findings cited to support policymaking, whether political or medical. What industry would ever pay to support research that would put it out of business? Whether or not you're in favor of industry self-regulation, no matter whether the research is funded by taxes, commercial revenue, or charitable sources, everyone deserves policies that are made based on the whole truth -- not based on a callously selective interpretation of the facts that ends up lining someone's pockets at the expense of others' health. After how many deaths or lost person-years do the industry payoffs start being blood money?\n\nI for one, as a bench scientist, am mightily tired of hearing about scientists taking money to produce the right conclusion. This is the kind of crap Bill Nye was railing against in his comments that the industry barons who pay off scientists to fit the results to the desired conclusions maybe should be thrown in jail. It's prima facie fraud.\n\nThe peer-reviewed paper in which the scientists make this report is freely available from the JAMA(Opens in a new window), and that's how it ought to be. The only solution to corruption in science is to get more critical eyes on the whole process. There needs to be an independent body of investigative experts accountable to the public, who have to submit to a zealous and hard-hitting inquiry into their financial interests, and who can serve as a sanity check for advisory boards or legislative committees.\n\nWe need a Mythbusters for medical advice: someone who isn't a wholly owned subsidiary of the industry. Someone who can turn on the lights and force the roaches of corruption to scatter. Pay-to-win gaming isn't fair, and people hate it, and pay-to-win science is just as bad. It's about time to start paying the skeptics, because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nBut the only way we can do the above is if the science is accessible. How much do you think a subscription to every major scientific journal would cost, even at the discounted academic rate? The EU's Horizon 2020 directive provided hosting and access that made freely available all research funded even in part by EU money -- while the authors retain the right to license, patent or commercialize their work, the peer-reviewed papers reporting their results are now free, as in libre and gratis. When they publish in Nature or wherever, they also have to publish in the European Research Council's public database.\n\nWe should do that in the US, because hosting is cheap. Then maybe we could afford to hire people like Penn and Teller, Adam and Jamie, or Phil Plait and James Randi: people with faces we know and judgment we've checked, people whose stock in trade it is to root out misunderstandings and weasel words. Policy grounded in research needs to be officially subjected to the kind of person who just can't stand it when someone is wrong on the internet. Give us some accountability and tear down this paywall.\n\nResearch: doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5394",

    "description": "Our 2nd most-read article of 2025.\n- - -It’s so easy to label people these days. From the way folks have been talking, you’d think everyone falls ...",
    "fullText": "Our 2nd most-read article of 2025.\n\nIt’s so easy to label people these days. From the way folks have been talking, you’d think everyone falls into two buckets: those who voted against the mayor who promised to blow up the city and those who voted for the mayor who promised to blow up the city. And now that the mayor, whom I voted for, is blowing up the city, as he promised, I’m one of many people who are being unfairly blamed for something I didn’t want. Okay? I didn’t want the mayor to blow up the city like he mentioned many times; I just wanted him to fix the old bowling alley like he promised in passing once. Anyone saying I’m partially responsible for the explosions is just a sign that they have no argument.\n\nBefore you rush to cancel me, try to remember the mayor made lots of promises, and I didn’t expect him to keep them all. Yes, he promised to turn our playgrounds to glass and take a blowtorch to the schools; yes, he said that he was going to use napalm on every grocery store, but, as I said, he also promised he was going to fix the old bowling alley.\n\nOh, how I loved that bowling alley as a kid. It’s been closed for twenty years, so when the mayor mentioned he’d fix it if we elected him, I had to give it a chance. To be fair, he was also the mayor a few years ago, made the same promise, and failed to fix the bowling alley then. But he did live up to his promise to reintroduce smallpox into local daycares, so at least you know he can get things done, unlike the other guy who did neither of those.\n\nI’ve seen all the attacks online. You use the mayor’s own clear statements of purpose against me just because I consciously chose this. “The mayor said he was going to blow up the city.” Yeah, metaphorically. “The mayor brought up his desire to see the residents of the city cleansed by flame in every speech.” Sure, if you take it out of context, maybe. “The mayor’s election slogan was, ‘Blow It All Up and Watch Them Suffer,’” which is scary only for people stupid enough to take him seriously. The fact that he had to go so far as to pour gasoline all over the Burger King before throwing a Molotov cocktail through the window shows what his opponents have pushed him to do. It’s really his critics that have kept him from fixing the bowling alley.\n\nLet me reiterate: I do not approve of the mayor locking the doors of the mall and igniting a bus full of C4 in the food court. I may have worn a shirt that said, VOTE FOR THE MAYOR WHO WILL BLOW UP THE MALL FOOD COURT, but that was just my fun way of saying I only cared about the bowling alley. It makes me sad that you think I wanted people to get hurt by this. Especially when it’s something that directly affected me for the first time in my life, when my nephew was accidentally trapped in that mall when it exploded. Give me a little grace here. Plus, my nephew voted for the other candidate, so it’s kind of his fault that he ended up there to begin with.\n\nIs it so bad that I wanted the bowling alley back? Maybe that’s what you’re really mad about. You wanted the mayor to fail. The negativity around the smell of roasting pig is just a facile attempt to distract from his potential future successes. I bet the mayor is about to fix up the bowling alley, and I’ll walk in, and I’ll be twelve again, and all the adults will be so tall, and it will be my party, and everyone—even the kids who don’t like me—will have to sing happy birthday. The previous mayor said that rebuilding the bowling alley wouldn’t make it 1996 again, which, to me, is unacceptable.\n\nIt’s disgusting and, frankly, counterproductive to point out that I voted for this. To imply that I had personal free will and agency when I walked into a voting booth and picked Mayor Bomberman is insulting. Here I am, admitting that I did not actually want the mayor’s biggest promise to happen, and you’re criticizing me for directly being part of the reason it’s happening. You should be praising me for being able to admit that—well, not that I was wrong, heaven forbid—but perhaps my faith in the mayor who was arrested thirty-four times for arson was misplaced.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can imply that I “wanted this” as much as you like. You don’t know what’s inside my heart. The mayor said he’d fix the bowling alley. Just because he hasn’t fixed the bowling alley and announced that he’ll never fix the bowling alley, doesn’t mean I’m dumb or a fool. And while he may have also promised he’d re-segregate the city, crash the city’s economy, and turn the city’s only remaining functional hospital into a big Jersey Mike’s, I can guarantee that I only wanted the Jersey Mike’s.\n\nSo, no, I’m not “happy now” that our zoo has been turned into an open-air animal mausoleum. But of the options I had, only one mayor promised to completely change the city. And you know what? At least he is doing something. It may kill a lot of people. It may leave others without homes or jobs. But I respect a man of action, regardless of what that action is and whether or not it’s going to make things better or worse.\n\nNow, I’ll just sit back and wait for the bowling alley to get fixed.\n\nMike Drucker’s new book, Good Game, No Rematch, combines ridiculous personal stories and fascinating gaming history to explore the poignant ways that electronic entertainment can save us from ourselves. Or humiliate us, case depending.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett has officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Investors are focused on what happens to the company's growing cash pile.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) entered a new era at the start of 2026 as legendary investor Warren Buffett officially handed the reins as CEO to his protégé, Greg Abel.\n\nBuffett leaves behind stunning realized returns of 6,100,000% over the past 60 years, built on his value-investing philosophy of buying \"wonderful companies at a fair price.\"\n\nThe key question for investors now is what Berkshire will do with its record $380 billion cash pile as the AI boom sweeps across Wall Street and drives valuations higher.\n\n\"Berkshire is so big now that you have to find bigger opportunities to move the needle,\" Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIf it doesn't spend that cash, Berkshire could soon face pressure to start issuing a dividend.\n\n\"As a shareholder, the amount of cash they have is excessive,\" Boyar Research president Jonathan Boyar said.\n\n\"Since Buffett is gone, and he's the greatest stock picker of all time, I'd like them to deemphasize the actual stock picking and start paying a dividend,\" he added.\n\nBuffett and his longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, were known for a hands-off, decentralized approach that allowed Berkshire's sprawling subsidiaries to operate independently.\n\nThose businesses span industries from railroads and energy to insurance and retail, with holdings ranging from GEICO to See's Candies.\n\nThe conglomerate also has stakes in Apple (AAPL), a top-performing investment and, most recently, tech giant Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nAnalysts expect Abel, a 25-year Berkshire veteran with deep experience in the company's energy and industrial operations, to lean into that background as he takes the helm.\n\n\"Under his leadership, it's likely to be an important segment for the company and, I think, investors. Given some of the industrial- and energy-related demands that AI is generating, I think that could be an interesting franchise to watch within the Berkshire framework,\" CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAbel may also take a more hands-on approach to managing Berkshire's businesses.\n\n\"There's probably a lot of fat to cut,\" Boyar said. \"There's probably divisions that could be consolidated. There's many things that ... they could do to enhance profitability.\"\n\nGlenview Trust's Bill Stone agrees.\n\n\"Could Munger and Buffett have been very good managers?\" he said. \"They may have, they just decided they don't want to do it. They prefer to spend their time looking for opportunities. There probably is, and I think we've seen it already, some real opportunity to add some professional management and skills ... that I think Greg seems to bring to the table.\"",

Then, he got an even bigger surprise.\n\nSean Klingler of Rigby was recently at a local gas station \"hangout\" having coffee when he decided to check some of the lottery tickets he had stashed in his truck, per a press release and Instagram video from the Idaho Lottery. He quickly found out he had a winner on his hands.\n\n\"I had eight Raffle tickets, and when the clerk checked them, she told me I had won $100,000,” Klingler recalled of his Idaho $1,000,000 Raffle tickets.\n\n“I didn’t believe her. I thought maybe it was $100,\" Klingler recalled of his initial reaction.\n\nThen, the news got even sweeter when the clerk realized that there were some zeros missing.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n\"She said to me, 'No, I got it wrong — you won $1,000,000!' \" Klingler told the Lottery in the release. \"There was a lot of high-fiving in the store after that.\"\n\n\"It was kind of like a craps table when you're on hot dice,\" he added with a laugh in the Instagram video.\n\nAfter signing his winning ticket, Klingler called his wife and daughter to tell them the exciting news. He said he had to put the call on speaker because they didn't believe him and he needed everyone in the store to confirm the win for him.\n\n\"Yeah, we called [some more] family. Nobody believes you right out of the get-go. They always think you're fooling them. This will help,\" he added in the video, motioning toward his winnings check.\n\nKlingler, his wife and daughter drove to the Lottery's office in Boise on Tuesday, Dec. 30, to claim his prize.\n\nThe man told the Lottery he plans to take \"a responsible approach\" with his winnings. He will pay off a few debts, buy his wife a new car and then put the rest toward his retirement.\n\n“I’ve been playing the Lottery for a long time,” Klingler shared. “You dream about winning, and when it finally comes true, it’s weird.”\n\nOther prizes from this year's Raffle game remain unclaimed, including a second $1,000,0000 ticket sold in Kootenai County and a $100,000 ticket sold in Payette County. Another man, Kurt Blaisdell of Pocatello, won $50,000 in the Raffle and told the Idaho Lottery he planned to use the money to buy his fiancée an engagement ring.",

    "description": "There’s still a great deal to be learned.",
    "fullText": "A scientist in New England came across startling images captured by a trail camera, showing the first documented case of this strange insect behavior in the region.\n\n\"It almost looked like the moose had two [additional] eyes,\" Laurence Clarfeld, an environmental researcher at the University of Vermont, told Scientific American. \"At first, I wasn't sure what it was.\"\n\nClarfeld was describing a scene in which moths could be seen feeding on moose tears. He'd come across the surprising moment while reviewing footage from a camera trap in the Green Mountain National Forest.\n\nThe thirsty bugs weren't indulging in schadenfreude, but in lachryphagy, or \"tear eating,\" a process by which moths and other insects sup on the tears of larger animals — even humans.\n\nAnd yet, it's not the act itself that's remarkable, but where it happened. Lachryphagy has long been assumed to occur almost exclusively in tropical climates. Observing this behavior in Vermont confounds the still-quite-limited scholarly understanding of it.\n\nAccording to Scientific American, there is only one other known and documented case of lachryphagy outside the tropics. That instance took place in Arkansas.\n\nSo what is it about tears that bugs find so enticing? There's no definitive answer yet, but one possible explanation is the unusually high protein content of tears, which is 200 times that of sweat.\n\nOne of the biggest risks of lachryphagy comes from its potential to spread disease. Clarfeld and two co-authors published an article on the footage in Ecosphere in November. They posited that \"eye-visiting moths may be vectors for disease transmission such as keratoconjunctivitis, a condition that may induce eye lesions in moose, with significant health impacts.\"\n\nMoose are already at risk of afflictions like chronic wasting disease, so they hardly need another source of infection. Moreover, the dangers could heighten as rising global temperatures expand the travel ranges of disease vectors.\n\nThere's still a great deal to be learned about lachryphagy, especially now that it has been observed in an entirely new type of climate. For scientists, the chance discovery is a call for further research and awareness.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIt's also a reminder of why trail cameras are some of the most powerful tools in wildlife research. A well-placed camera can reveal enormously valuable information about the population and status of a species in an area.\n\nAs in this case, cameras can also uncover previously unknown behaviors that could further our understanding of nature.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "China Stopped Production On The World's Largest Particle Accelerator - Here's Why",
    "description": "China's ambitious new particle accelerator was meant to pick up where the Large Hadron Collider left off, but the project was put on pause. Here's the story.",
    "fullText": "Planned to be the largest particle accelerator in the world, China's Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) was meant to be about 100 kilometers or 62 miles long. That's much bigger than CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an approximately 27 kilometer circumference – or nearly 17 miles. These systems, especially the LHC, play a huge role in studying how the universe began during the Big Bang.\n\nDevelopment for CEPC started in 2012, around the time CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle; however, it appears the multibillion-dollar project is now paused. It was not included in the country's next five-year plan, spanning 2026 to 2030, which means it's considered a lower priority by the state — it will see less funding and resources. Wang Yifang from the Institute of High Energy Physics confirmed the change, but although the recent proposal to be included in China's five-year plan was denied, the team plans to resubmit the CEPC proposal in 2030.\n\nWhile it hasn't been directly confirmed, the CEPC would cost an estimated $5.1 billion, money that the country might want to divert elsewhere. In that case, Wang says if the European Future Circular Collider (FCC) – the next-generation collider that would effectively be LHC's successor with a much larger 90.7-kilometer (or 56-mile) circumference – is approved before the 2030 proposals, they'll likely join forces with the related teams instead.\n\nTo summarize, China's CEPC is out, likely due to cost and resource requirements, but the European's FCC still has potential, and the Chinese physicist team may join up if the proposal is approved before the next round of China's plans.\n\nDiscoveries from the systems we have operating now, like the Higgs boson discovery at LHC, occur because of how particle accelerators actually work. They fire particles into a big tunnel, or underground rings, which circle around at incredibly fast speeds before colliding. By observing these collisions, scientists get a glimpse into what the early universe looked like, as well as other foundational elements like quarks, the building blocks of visible matter in the universe. Scientists also used the system to create quark soup, a substance that hadn't been seen for billions of years before that. Generally speaking, when two particles collide, for the infinitesimally small span of time afterwards, scientists can see traces or patterns that are otherwise invisible — that's exactly how they discovered the Higgs boson.\n\nThe larger colliders, like CEPC or FCC, would not only introduce larger tunnel systems but more advanced and unique equipment, to uncover heavier or different particles, many of which the LHC simply cannot create. Imagine what kind of alchemy could be achieved with the larger, more capable collider systems.\n\nAs the current system, the LHC is expected to be phased out by the 2040s; meanwhile, the FCC, if approved, will begin development in the 2030s. That said, construction can't start quite that easily: Before anything happens, the CERN Member States and international partners have to give the upgrade project a greenlight.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "Many people start the new year thinking about ways to improve their health, be more organized and manage their finances. Experts say there is one area that touches on each of those resolutions — home care.\n\nEarly and routine home maintenance goes beyond fixing visible damage. It helps ensure a healthy living environment, extends the life of a home and can protect its long-term value, according to real estate professionals. Planning ahead for regular upkeep and for unexpected emergencies can reduce the risk of costly repairs later and help spread expenses more evenly throughout the year.\n\nAccording to research by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, about three-quarters of existing homes are expected to still be in use in 2050.\n\n“Maintaining the homes that we have is really essential to protecting our health and our well-being,” said Amanda Reddy, executive director of the National Center for Healthy Housing, an organization that researches and advocates for reducing housing-related health disparities.\n\nDespite who owns the property, Reddy says, keeping residences dry, clean, pest-free, well-ventilated and safe is the goal, which can mean different types of maintenance depending on the type of home, where someone lives and the time of year. Here's what experts say about home care and what tasks to put on the checklist this year:\n\nHome care includes the big projects and the everyday decisions\n\nOn average, Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors, 70% of that time inside of a residence, according to the National Human Activity Pattern Survey.\n\n“It's not just that we spend time indoors, but at home. If you are older, very young, have health concerns, or work from home, it is likely more than that,” Reddy said, emphasizing the reason why home care is a valuable investment.\n\nWhat many people think of maintenance includes addressing water and gas leaks, pest infestations, cracks and other major repairs, but home builders say not everything needs a professional and can include actions as simple as wiping counters and sweeping floors of food debris, opening windows for better ventilation or clearing out clogged filters and drains.\n\nResidents should also consider the needs of those living in the home, commonly used spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms, and typically neglected areas like attics and basements. Reddy says “anywhere we’re spending time” or often ignoring and possibly missing necessary repairs should be prioritized.\n\n“At the end of the day, doing any preventative maintenance at all matters more than doing it perfectly or at exactly the right time,” Reddy said. “But timing can make a big difference. A lot of these tasks are seasonal or annual, and you’re not just going to do it one time. Homes are stressed differently by different times of the year, so seasonal maintenance helps us catch problems before they’re made worse by environmental stressors.”\n\nSeasonal maintenance to plan for throughout the year\n\nWhen it comes to maintenance, planning and preparing for anticipated and routine changes in the environment can help mitigate natural wear and tear on the exterior of homes and also create healthy conditions inside — where most people shelter from extreme weather events.\n\n“What happens outside the house rarely stays outside the house. What’s outside gets inside, what’s inside builds up,\" Reddy said, adding that fluctuating outdoor conditions put stress on appliances and systems at different times of the year. “For most people, the seasonal rhythm not only makes sense because of those stressors, it also just is more realistic and effective than trying to tackle a long, overwhelming checklist all at once.\"\n\nFor example, experts say the best time to prepare for cold and wet climate, storms and other natural disasters is to address concerns before temperatures drop. Similarly, it is recommended that residents address systems in homes that work to reduce the effects of extreme high temperatures, dry and drought conditions and associated risks like wildfires and air quality in the offseason.\n\nProfessional guidance from home inspectors, builders and real estate agents says spring and summer tasks should focus on preparing for warmer weather. Experts recommend checking air conditioning systems, cleaning dryer vents to prevent fire hazards, testing sprinkler systems, tending to gardens and plants around homes' exterior and inspecting appliances, electrical equipment and plumbing fixtures. Experts also say spring is a good time to clean and do any house projects that involve painting or remodeling since rain is unlikely to cause delays during that time.\n\nIn the fall and winter months, experts suggest focusing on temperature control and air quality measures as people tend to shelter indoors during incoming colder weather. American Home Inspectors Training guidance says check heating systems, clean air filters, make sure carbon monoxide detectors are working, seal air leaks, prioritize pest control, clean and repair roofs and chimneys, and inspecting drainage options in and around homes.",

    "description": "It may feel safe and comfy, but experts warn it could lead to lasting nerve damage.",
    "fullText": "It’s the same every morning. That tingling creeps into your fingers. And your shoulders? Stiff as always. You stretch out your arms and roll your shoulders until the feeling comes back. You get up, shake it off. Probably nothing, you tell yourself.\n\nJust slept weird, right? Maybe not. The way you sleep might be the real problem.\n\nFinds: This Pillow Literally ‘Cradles’ Your Neck So You Can Sleep Without Pain — And It’s Finally On Sale\n\nMany people don’t even realize it’s happening. They fall asleep with their arms relaxed, but by 3 a.m., they’ve curled in tight. Sleeping with arms bent, curled close to your chest, has been dubbed the “T. rex position” on social media. And while doctors don’t call it that, they do warn that doing it night after night can turn those temporary pins and needles into lasting nerve damage.\n\n“When you sleep with your arms bent and tucked in, you can press on the nerves in your elbows or wrists,” Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a sleep medicine specialist and chief medical adviser for Sleepopolis, told HuffPost. “This can slow blood flow and make your arms feel numb or tingly. If you do it often, it can also strain your shoulders and make them stiff or sore.”\n\nAccording to Dr. Matthew Bennett, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, some people also develop similar nerve irritation at the wrist, much like what happens with carpal tunnel syndrome. Keeping your elbow bent all night builds pressure where nerves pass through narrow spaces.\n\nTurns out, it’s surprisingly common — and it can steadily get worse over time.\n\nHealth: What We Get Wrong About Death, According To End-Of-Life Workers\n\nKieran Sheridan, a physiotherapist and founder of GulfPhysio, sees complaints regularly in his practice. Patients often describe a “dead arm” feeling or needing to shake out their hands in the morning. “This is your body telling you your nervous system isn’t happy,” he said.\n\nDasgupta also emphasized this. “If your arms or hands go numb every night, stay numb for a while after waking up, or start to feel weak during the day, it’s time to see a doctor.”\n\nWarning signs include shooting pain down your arm, trouble gripping things or even dropping your phone more often. Don’t mistake these for annoying symptoms or clumsiness. It’s your body telling you the damage is getting worse.\n\nBennett said anyone who notices these symptoms becoming more frequent should get checked. “Most cases are manageable and respond well to early, conservative treatment,” he said. Skip treatment, and that’s when trouble starts.\n\n“It’s usually temporary and goes away once you change your sleeping position,” Dasgupta noted. “But if the pressure keeps happening for a long time, weeks or months, it can cause lasting nerve damage.”\n\nCurling up feels comforting. It’s instinctive, like pulling a blanket tighter when you’re cold. However, there’s usually more behind it.\n\nThe body slips into self-protection even when there’s no threat. When the nervous system is on high alert from chronic pain, stress, poor sleep or trauma, Bennett said, “we may subconsciously adopt postures that feel safer and less exposed.”\n\nHealth: This Simple Scandinavian Bed Hack Could Be The Key To Better Sleep\n\nWe automatically search for safety during sleep. And for some people, that search runs deeper than others. Judit Merayo Barredo, a clinical psychologist, said she had a patient who came to therapy experiencing chronic insomnia and persistent fatigue.\n\nEvery night, her patient would wake up tightly curled, arms pressed to her chest, shoulders hunched in that T. rex position. “She often woke with muscle tension, a clenched jaw, and a feeling of emotional heaviness,” Barredo said, “despite sleeping for hours.” It turns out, Barredo’s client was dealing with heavy anxiety and expressing it in her sleep.\n\nThe first goal Barredo set for her patient was calming down her nervous system at night. They tried guided body scans before bed, pre-sleep journaling to get the stress out and also changing her sleep setup. The patient added extra pillows, softened the lights and built a routine she could actually stick to. Barredo said the “shift in her sleep position was one of the first signs that her body was learning to feel safe again.”\n\nOf course, not everyone sleeping in the T. rex position suffers from chronic anxiety. Everyday stress, trauma, poor sleep and regular tension can trigger the same response.\n\nHealth: This Extremely Common Social Habit May Actually Be A Sign Of ADHD\n\nThe problem is willpower doesn’t work during sleep. You can’t tell yourself to stop curling up in the middle of the night. So the aim is to make it physically harder to curl up using barriers and supports.\n\nBennett recommended something surprisingly simple: wrap a hand towel around your elbow and secure it loosely with an elastic bandage. This creates a soft barrier that makes deep bending uncomfortable without waking you up. If you have wrist pain, a wrist brace at night also helps.\n\nFor side sleepers, Sheridan suggests a couple of approaches:\n\nPlace a small pillow or folded towel between your arms and chest to prevent that full curl.\n\nHug a body pillow to keep your arms neutral while giving you something to hold.\n\nIf you sleep on your back, rest your arms by your side or on a pillow near the hips. Your arms should stay straight or just slightly bent. Don’t tuck them under your body or pillow.\n\nHealth: The Time It Takes To Fall Asleep Can Reveal A Lot About Your Health\n\n“Keeping the arms open allows for better circulation, less nerve compression, and faster muscle recovery,” Sheridan explained.\n\nSince this position often reflects a nervous system on high alert, Bennett suggested calming techniques before bed, like breath work or gentle stretching. “The goal isn’t rigid posture correction,” he said. “It’s offering the body more supportive options for rest and recovery.”\n\nIf you wake up with numb hands, stiff shoulders, or pins and needles in your arm, you don’t need a total sleep overhaul, just a few small tweaks. Tonight’s the night to make a change. The T. rex couldn’t change its position ― but you can.\n\n'Orthosomnia' Might Be Ruining Your Sleep.

While conditions improve for most areas on Monday, hazardous winter weather will linger into Tuesday near Lake Iliamna and the Western Alaska Range,\" the NWS revealed.\n\nA high wind warning is in effect for parts of Alaska starting from Sunday morning through Monday as the state braces for winds up to 115 mph. A high wind warning is issued when an area is hit with sustained winds over 60 mph.\n\n\"Take Action! Sustained, strong winds with even stronger gusts are happening. Seek shelter. If you are driving, keep both hands on the wheels and slow down,\" the NWS said.\n\nWhile parts of the state brace for extremely dangerous winds, other parts of the state will start to receive heavy snowfall on Sunday afternoon. \"Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches, with localized amounts up to 30 inches from Port Alsworth to Iliamna. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Visibility reduced to one half mile or less at times,\" the NWS revealed.\n\n\"Snow will develop by Sunday afternoon and continue through Monday before tapering off to snow showers by Monday evening. Areas of stronger winds, especially around Lake Iliamna, may produce blowing snow that could significantly reduce visibility.\"\n\nIn the event of a strong wind event, the National Weather Service warned residents to stay inside.\n\n\"Immediately go inside a sturdy building during a high wind warning or severe thunderstorm warning and move to an interior room or basement,\" it said. \"If you are in a mobile home, move to a sturdy building before the winds pick up or the storm system reaches your location.\"",

    "title": "LG's 'Aerominum' Gram Pro laptops feel impossibly light and strong",
    "description": "LG has finally fixed its flex issues thanks to the Gram Pro's Aerominum case.",
    "fullText": "For years, LG has pushed its ultra-light Gram laptops as a way to stand out from the PC crowd, for better or worse. I was't a big fan of the flex-prone case in the 2017 Gram, and we had similar concerns with the first 17-inch Gram in 2019. But in fairness, it's been a while since we've reviewed one, and we found a lot to like in our preview of last year's AI-equipped model. Now LG is back with a major Gram Pro redesign at CES 2026, which features a new aluminum/magnesium alloy it's dubbed \"Aerominum.\" And finally, it seems LG has found a balance between building a super-light notebook (the 16-inch Gram Pro weighs just 2.6 pounds), and crafting something that actually feels durable.\n\nAdmittedly, the Gram Pro doesn't look particularly impressive at first glance. It has a large 16-inch 2.8K OLED screen, which certainly looks nice, but doesn't really stand out from the glut of other OLED laptops on market. It's also powered by Intel's new Panther Lake chips, and it supports dual NVMe SSDs. The magic happens when you pick it up: My brain had a hard time computing how such a large computer felt so light in my hands. And best of all, it didn't flex much when I tried to squeeze the case.\n\nThere's still a bit of give, to be clear, but it didn't feel as precariously bendy as earlier models. I wouldn't stress too much about throwing it into a messenger bag without additional protection. The more I handled the Gram Pro, the more I wished other PC makers strived for similar weight reduction. The Gram Pro weighs about as much as the 13-inch MacBook Air! That's certainly an impressive feat.\n\nI just wish LG spent as much time refining the Gram Pro's keyboard as its case design. There's barely any key travel, which made for an unresponsive and unsatisfying typing experience. I get it, LG probably doesn't have the available vertical height for much key movement, but there are other ways to make typing feel more dynamic. The Gram Pro's trackpad, meanwhile, is serviceable, but it also didn't feel as smooth and responsive as what we see from Apple's notebooks or Microsoft's Surface Laptop.\n\nIn addition to the 16-inch Gram Pro, LG also debuted a 17-inch model with an Aerominum case, which is notable for being the lightest notebook at that size with an NVIDIA RTX GPU. Specifically, it's toting the RTX 5050, which should be enough to play most games at the laptop's native 2,880 by 1,800 resolution (or 1440p blown up a bit). Given the more powerful hardware, the Gram Pro 17 is heavier than the 16-inch model, but it still comes at a relatively light 3.8 pounds. I didn't get a chance to play any games on the laptop, unfortunately, but overall it looks like a decent option for someone who wants a large screen with a bit of horsepower.",

    "fullText": "It's in our nature to want more: More money. More friends. More muscle. More food. A more luxurious car. And, of course, more gains by way of the stock market.\n\nHow can I tell after a year in which the S&P 500's (^GSPC) total return was 17.88%, bringing the index's three-year total return to 86.11%? Because I am always getting asked by people for stock ideas, especially after years of the market basically moving up and to the right.\n\nAs a rule, I don't give out stock ideas, as that is no longer my career (I was an analyst for a decade). So I come to you at the start of 2026 with a tidy list of stock ideas provided by my contacts.\n\nI caution that I am not endorsing the picks of these money management pros. This is not me saying to dump your life savings into these stocks or even buy a single share.\n\nDo your homework on each one. In doing so, you may find you like other stocks in the industry better.\n\n\"One chip company in the world is fueling the AI revolution, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, the [earnings] numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15% to 20% at a minimum [earnings growth] going into 2026. You put that together, and I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026.\"\n\n\"We love Palantir. From a defense standpoint, they are the leader in AI and data, with Defense Department approval and usage. And then beyond that, corporate adoption and sovereign adoption. So we think the name continues [to go higher]. It's one of those names, you can't justify it from a valuation standpoint. But the narrative is quite compelling. And that can drive stocks for a very long time, like it did Amazon for the first 20 years of Amazon's post-IPO life.\"\n\n\"I think Broadcom is a little misunderstood. We were big buyers of it during COVID actually when it was giving you over a 3% dividend yield. So you know we like dividends. So what I like about it is the VMware side of the business and the programable side. These are very specialized chips. So not competing as much with Nvidia, and I think they're creating their own market. And I think their growth rate and the ownership has been tremendous.\n\n\"We've been trimming this position because it grew to so much in our accounts. I mean, we had up to 7% of our portfolio in Broadcom. We didn't want that much. We still like it, but we're not expecting the 5,060% return. We'd be very happy with Broadcom [returning] about 10%.\"",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",
