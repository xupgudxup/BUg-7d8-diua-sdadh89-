    "description": "The Jets finished out a dismal season with another blowout loss, this time losing to the Buffalo Bills, 35-8.",
    "fullText": "The final game ever at Highmark Stadium had an unusual preseason-esque vibe to it with Buffalo prioritizing resting key contributors ahead of the postseason and the Jets knowing that an upset win would cost them the opportunity to pick second in the NFL draft. However, despite quarterback Josh Allen only playing the first snap, the Bills never looked in danger of losing with veteran Mitchell Trubisky at the helm.\n\nBuffalo marched 80 yards on their first possession, which ended on Trubisky’s 17-yard touchdown pass to Dawson Knox, then doubled their lead on a six-yard run by former Jets running back Ty Johnson.\n\nAfter the Jets turned the ball over on downs near midfield, the Bills quickly increased the lead to 21-0 on a two-yard pass from Trubisky to Ray Davis, who also rushed for 151 yards.\n\nMidway through the third quarter Trubisky threw another touchdown pass to Gabe Davis and a two-point conversion to Keon Coleman to make it 29-0.\n\nJohnson second touchdown, on Trubisky’s fourth touchdown pass, extended the lead to 35-0 with 12 minutes remaining, this time with the two-point conversion unsuccessful.\n\nNew York had the last word as they finally managed to get on the board with 7:33 to go, on a short touchdown pass from Brady Cook to Andrew Beck. Cook also found undrafted rookie Quinton Skinner for the two-point conversion.\n\n-- While it might be considered embarrassing for the Jets to struggle against a Bills team that was mostly backups, it’s fair to note that much of New York’s defense was comprised of third and fourth-stringers. Four of the five starters in the secondary were Ja’Sir Taylor, Keidron Smith, Tre Brown and Samuel Womack. Taylor was acquired at the trade deadline and mostly used on special teams until last week and the other three have been signed or elevated from the practice squad in the past week or two.\n\n-- Two more undrafted rookies, who had been starting in the secondary – Dean Clark and Jordan Clark – did not start, so were presumably benched in favor of the above quartet, none of whom are rookies. That perhaps reflects their own struggles in recent weeks.\n\n-- The Bills moved effortlessly downfield in 11 plays on their opening drive, mostly by running the ball, but scored on a pass play as Knox was left all alone by a coverage bust, which appeared to be Taylor’s fault, although Quincy Williams also left a receiver completely uncovered. You aren’t going to stop any NFL team, even with their reserves in, if you have defensive breakdowns like that.\n\n-- The Jets didn’t start the game any better on offense as they went three-and-out on their first two possessions. That included a play where they were flagged for having 12 men in the huddle on the first series.\n\n-- New York became the first team in NFL history not to register an interception for an entire season and also set the all-time record for fewest defensive turnovers ever in a season. Brown had a potential interception deflect off his hands on Buffalo’s second drive and Williams dropped one in the third quarter. A Jets fumble recovery was also overturned by replay review.\n\n-- Cook may at some point be a solid backup or fringe starter, but the undrafted rookie has clearly been overmatched for the past month and it’s unclear whether throwing him into this situation will benefit him in the long run. While the Jets were even more undermanned than usual at the skill positions with Breece Hall and Isaiah Davis unavailable, Cook was still playing behind a full-strength offensive line, and his lack of production reflects his limitations. He ended up with just 60 passing yards on 22 attempts.\n\n-- It’s difficult to cite any bright spots from the Jets, who were outgained by 470 yards to 122 and didn’t register a single quarterback hit. However, Womack had seven tackles and a nice pass breakup in the end zone. He also would have had a fumble recovery if the runner hadn’t been ruled down. Womack was elevated from the practice squad yesterday so if he impressed the coaches, he would need to be signed to a futures deal tomorrow.\n\n-- The Jets ultimately lost each of their last five games by 23 points or more, as they were not remotely competitive down the stretch. This does not reflect well on the coaching staff, even though they can point to the personnel limitations which caused them to be so overmatched each week, and the previous few months where they were competitive and even won three of five at one point. This could mean the coaches have a shorter leash in the event of a slow start with a retooled roster next season.\n\nTrubisky picked apart the Jets’ inexperienced secondary, which didn’t exactly make things difficult for him, but it was an efficient performance as he completed 22 of 29 passes for 259 yards and four touchdowns.\n\nBrady Cook ➡️ Andrew Beck to get the Jets on the board pic.twitter.com/j96ZZIvk62\n\n— Jets Videos (@snyjets) January 5, 2026\n\nAttention now turns to the offseason with the draft and free agency on the horizon.",

If the Ravens beat the Steelers on Sunday Night Football, they will host Houston in the Wild Card round.\n\nThe NFL closes out the 2025-26 regular season schedule with the Pittsburgh Steelers hosting the Baltimore Ravens on Sunday Night Football. The game kicks off at 8:20 p.m. ET with the AFC North title on the line. The Ravens are a 3.5-point road favorite heading into the matchup.\n\nThe big news for this matchup is that Baltimore will have Lamar Jackson back at QB. He missed last week’s game against the Packers due to a back injury. He’s been banged up for much of this season but is still a proven upgrade over Tyler Huntley. The Ravens would have been an underdog in this matchup if Jackson couldn’t go.\n\nThe Ravens have to win to secure the AFC North and the accompanying playoff berth. They are 8-8 and win would improve them to 9-8. The Steelers are 9-7 and a loss would drop them to 9-8. A Ravens win would even the season series but give Baltimore the division record tiebreaker.\n\nThe winner of the game will secure the No. 4 seed in the playoffs.

    "description": "The Sporting Tribune's Fernando Ramirez writes about the grit from Jim Harbaugh's squad and how all eyes are on New England now.",
    "fullText": "The Chargers lost to the Denver Broncos 19–3 to finish the 2025–26 season with an 11–6 record, identical to last season.\n\nSunday was about going into Denver, playing the game, and getting out healthy before the playoffs begin next weekend. For the most part, the Chargers accomplished all three.\n\nJim Harbaugh’s decision to prioritize health proved to be the correct move, as the Chargers sat several key players including Justin Herbert, Derwin James, Khalil Mack, Quentin Johnston, Ladd McConkey, and Daiyan Henley, among others.\n\nThe Chargers will now travel to New England to face the second-place AFC Patriots in the Wild Card round. It sets up a Justin Herbert vs. Drake Maye and Jim Harbaugh vs. Mike Vrabel matchup in Round 1.\n\nDespite the loss, the Chargers’ backups gave the Broncos’ starters some trouble.\n\nWith Herbert sitting, Trey Lance (20-for-44, 136 yards, one interception) made the start. It wasn’t pretty, but it was just the sixth start of his NFL career.\n\nOn the Broncos’ opening drive, Bo Nix (14-for-23, 141 passing yards, 49 rushing yards) moved the offense down the field, hitting Pat Bryant for a 9-yard gain on 3rd-and-6 from their own 30. On the next play, Nix scrambled for 22 yards to the Chargers’ 39. Runs by RJ Harvey and Jaleel McLaughlin picked up a combined 21 yards before the drive stalled on a 3-yard loss by Tyler Badie, as cornerback Tarheeb Still sniffed out the play. Broncos kicker Will Lutz connected on a 24-yard field goal to give Denver a 3–0 lead.\n\nThe Chargers’ second drive was ugly—really ugly. On 3rd-and-5 from their own 40, Lance threw a pass to KeAndre Lambert-Smith, but the rookie receiver popped the ball up to Ja’Quan McMillian, who returned it for a touchdown to make it 10–0.\n\nJan 4, 2026; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos cornerback Ja'quan McMillian (29) celebrates with teammates after scoring a touchdown against the Los Angeles Chargers during the first half at Empower Field at Mile High.\n\nOffense was a struggle for both teams. The Chargers had three drives of 13 plays, while Denver had three drives of 15 plays, but neither team scored again until just before halftime.\n\nLance opened the Chargers’ next scoring drive with an 11-yard scramble, followed by a series of short passes to move the chains. He completed four passes to Keenan Allen for 17 yards—enough for Allen to earn a $250,000 bonus by reaching 750 receiving yards on the season. Lance also found tight end Oronde Gadsden for six yards and hit Lambert-Smith for an 18-yard gain while covered by Patrick Surtain. Cameron Dicker knocked through a 30-yard field goal to cut the deficit to 10–3 at halftime.\n\nComing out of the break, the Broncos’ offense stalled with a three-and-out, which the Chargers matched.\n\nNix generated some momentum on Denver’s next drive with a 37-yard catch-and-run to tight end Evan Engram. However, after a run for no gain by Harvey and two incompletions, Lutz converted a 26-yard field goal to extend the lead to 13–3.\n\nAfter two Chargers punts and one Broncos punt, Nix faced 3rd-and-1 from his own 28. He handed the ball to Harvey, but undrafted rookie linebacker Marlowe Wax shot through and made the stop for a one-yard loss.\n\nThe Chargers got the ball back at their own 24 when Nik Bonitto strip-sacked Lance, with Denver recovering. The Chargers’ defense responded, as defensive tackle Justin Eboigbe recorded one of his two sacks on 3rd-and-11 from the 21 to force a 41-yard Lutz field goal, pushing the score to 16–3.\n\nJan 4, 2026; Denver, Colorado, USA; Denver Broncos linebacker Nik Bonitto (15) hits Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Trey Lance (5) during the third quarter at Empower Field at Mile High.\n\nThe Bolts continued to show fight, particularly on defense. With defensive coordinator Jesse Minter’s name circulating as a head coaching candidate, performances like this only strengthen his résumé.\n\nDenver secured the No. 1 seed and will receive a bye, while the Chargers head to New England—a team they have never beaten in three previous playoff matchups.\n\nThe Chargers did suffer injuries to cornerback Donte Jackson, receiver KeAndre Lambert-Smith, safety Kendall Williamson, and edge rusher Bud Dupree, all of whom left the game.\n\nThose injuries will be worth monitoring, especially Jackson’s, as he is arguably the Chargers’ best cornerback.\n\nStill, the Chargers are back in the playoffs. With several key players getting much-needed rest, they should be ready for their Wild Card matchup against the Patriots.",

    "fullText": "UConn Men’s basketball four wins away from program history originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe No. 4 UConn men’s basketball team is not only dominating the regular season, but it is also chasing history. The Huskies recently set a modern-era NCAA Tournament record with 13 consecutive March Madness wins, a streak that began during their 2023 national championship run and continued through the 2025 tournament before ending in the Round of 32. That achievement tied Duke’s historic mark from 1991–93 and further cemented UConn’s status as one of college basketball’s elite programs.\n\nNow, the Huskies are closing in on another major milestone. With their current winning streak, UConn needs three more victories to tie the longest winning streak in program history. Upcoming matchups against Providence, DePaul, and Seton Hall will decide if the Huskies can reach that mark. If UConn defeats Georgetown after that stretch, it would set a new program record for most consecutive wins.\n\nUConn continued its impressive run Sunday afternoon with a 73–57 wire-to-wire win over Marquette at Gampel Pavilion. The Huskies never trailed and earned their 10th straight victory, improving to 14–1 overall and 4–0 in BIG EAST play.\n\nThe win matched UConn’s best start through 15 games under head coach Dan Hurley and marked the fourth straight season the Huskies have posted a winning streak of at least 10 games.\n\nSolo Ball led UConn with 17 points and added a season-high eight rebounds, along with a steal and a block in a strong all-around performance. Silas Demary Jr. finished with 14 points despite dealing with foul trouble, while Tarris Reed Jr. contributed 13 points and nine rebounds, just missing a double-double.\n\nFrom the opening tip, UConn set the tone with physical defense and strong play in the paint. Back-to-back dunks and consistent interior scoring helped the Huskies build a double-digit lead in the first half. A late basket by Reed sent UConn into halftime ahead 37–29.\n\nThe second half belonged to the Huskies. UConn opened with a quick scoring run, highlighted by a three-pointer from Ball, and stretched the lead to as many as 20 points. Marquette struggled to find any offensive rhythm, shooting just over 32 percent from the field.\n\nDefense and rebounding were key to the victory. UConn finished with a 49–37 advantage on the boards, controlled second-chance opportunities, and blocked eight shots as a team. Jaylin Stewart, Alex Karaban, and freshman Eric Reibe all made important contributions, especially on defense. Reibe continued his steady play by grabbing at least five rebounds for the eighth time this season.\n\nWith the win, UConn has now defeated Marquette six straight times and remains unbeaten in BIG EAST play. As the Huskies prepare to face Providence next, they continue to build momentum and move closer to making program history.\n\nRick Pitino reacts to St. John’s opening win\n\nOhio State loses point guard commitment\n\nAJ Dybansta makes debut for BYU\n\nJalen Rose on TNT college basketball coverage",

    "fullText": "The Dallas Cowboys wrapped up their 2025 season on Sunday and will now turn all of their attention to offseason work in the name of not finding themselves out of the playoffs this time next year. Obviously that is much easier said than done.\n\nThis upcoming offseason is one of the most important and critical in recent Cowboys history as they have multiple first-round draft picks for the first time since 2008. With the Cowboys now officially done for the season, we know where they will be picking come the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nHere are the first 12 picks of the draft, through the Cowboys selection at number 12 overall, courtesy of Tankathon.\n\nIf all of this sounds familiar it is because it is… the Cowboys held the 12th overall pick last year and used it to select Tyler Booker. They also used it in 2021 to select Micah Parsons, more on him in a moment, although they picked it up after trading back two spots. For what it’s worth the Detroit Lions held the pick in consecutive seasons beginning the year after and landed Jameson Williams and Jahmyr Gibbs, so hopefully that type of success is what the Cowboys find.\n\nWhile we know where the Cowboys are picking, it is still unknown exactly where their other first-round pick will land. Dallas holds Green Bay’s selection in the 2026 NFL Draft and the Packers are currently set to visit the Chicago Bears in the Wild Card Round which means we are all rooting for Chicago to take care of business.\n\nKeep in mind that Dallas has also already dealt away 2026 draft capital as well.\n\n2nd: Dealt away in Quinnen Williams trade\n\n3rd: Dealt away in George Pickens trade\n\n6th: Dealt away in Jordan Phillips trade with New York Giants in early 2024, also received a 7th that was sent to the Cincinnati Bengals in exchange for Logan Wilson\n\n7th (Kansas City’s): Acquired from the Chiefs when Dallas sent them Peyton Hendershot in early 2024\n\n7th (their own): Dealt away when Dallas traded for Kaiir Elam in early 2025\n\nThe Cowboys are projected to receive a couple of compensatory picks as well, potentially in the fifth-round, but those are not fully known at this time.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThere were extremely high expectations entering this season following the Philadelphia Eagles' Super Bowl win over the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nWhile Philadelphia still finds itself in the postseason as the No. 3 seed, the Eagles have been a shell of their former selves a season ago.\n\nThe issue this season has not been the defense but the offense struggling to find its chemistry and rhythm. A.J. Brown has been at the forefront of headlines since the beginning of the season.\n\nDespite the struggles and drama, the Eagles have one of the more talented rosters in the NFL. Combine that with championship experience, and there's always a chance to go on a postseason run.\n\nThe Eagles found out their first-round opponent in Week 18. The Sporting News breaks Philadelphia's Wild Card weekend matchup below.\n\nNFL Week 18 picks against the spread\n\nThe Eagles locked in the No. 3 seed in the NFC in Week 18, despite coming in with a chance to earn the No. 2 seed.\n\nBecause of the Los Angeles Rams' win over the Arizona Cardinals, Philadelphia also locked in its Wild Card Weekend opponent.\n\nMORE:What to know about Eagles' Super Bowl 59 rings\n\nThe 'Niners were playing for the top overall seed in Week 18; however, because they lost to the Seattle Seahawks and the Rams won, the Eagles are now matched up with San Francisco in the opening round.\n\nMORE:What to know about 49ers injury history timeline\n\nIf the Chicago Bears lost in Week 18 and the Eagles had won, Philadelphia would have claimed the No. 2 seed in the NFC conference.\n\nThat would have also resulted in them facing the Packers in the wild-card round of the playoffs, but it didn't come to fruition.\n\nMORE:Explaining the origins of the 'Lambeau Leap'\n\nComing into Week 18, the Eagles would have been projected face off against the Rams in the wild-card round.\n\nHowever, because the Rams beat the Cardinals, they moved up to the No. 5 seed to face the Panthers in the first round.\n\nMORE:Meaning behind Puka Nacua's nickname\n\nWith their record and lead in the NFC, the furthest the Seahawks could have fallen after a Week 18 loss is No. 5. Seattle won, however, to earn the No. 1 seed.\n\nThis made it impossible for Seattle to match up against Philadelphia in the Wild Card regardless.\n\nMORE:Ranking the 15 greatest Seahawks players in history\n\nWith the Bears winning the NFC North and their record, the furthest they could have fallen after a Week 18 loss was No. 3. Again, making it impossible for the Eagles to have played them in the opening round.\n\nMORE:Why does Caleb Williams paint his nails?\n\nThe winner of the NFC South, the Carolina Panthers, claimed the No. 4 seed in the NFC conference. Because the Eagles couldn't fall below No. 3, they could not play Carolina in the opening round.\n\nMORE:Meet Baker Mayfield's family tree, including influencer wife Emily",

    "fullText": "Florida football landed a Power 4 conference quarterback out of the transfer portal, securing a commitment Georgia Tech quarterback Aaron Philo, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo brings dual threat ability and familiarity with the scheme under new Florida Gators offensive coordinator Buster Faulkner, who was his offensive coordinator at Georgia Tech for the last two seasons. He visited UF over the weekend along with teammate and wide receiver Bailey Stockwell.\n\nA redshirt freshman with three years of eligibility remaining, the 6-foot-2, 220-pound Philo showed promise as a backup quarterback in two seasons with the Yellow Jackets, throwing for 938 yards with 2 TDs to 3 interceptions over two seasons while rushing for 95 yards and 1 TD. Philo has appeared in seven games over two seasons and while alternating with starter Haynes King, helped lead Georgia Tech to a 28-23 upset win over Miami on Nov. 9, 2024.\n\nA three-star recruit out of Prince Andrew Christian School in Bogart, Ga., Philo broke Jacksonville Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence's high school record for passing yards in the state of Georgia with 13,922 yards during his prep career.\n\nPhilo will compete with redshirt freshman Tramel Jones Jr. for the starting quarterback job at Florida. Jones, who announced his intention to return to UF in December, completed 21 of 35 passes for 191 yards and 2 TDs in two games as former UF quarterback DJ Lagway's backup last season. Florida also brings back redshirt sophomore quarterback Aidan Warner and adds incoming four-star freshman quarterback Will Griffin, who plans to enroll at UF this month for the spring semester.\n\nPhilo joins Baylor safety DJ Coleman as the second commitment in UF's 2026 transfer portal class.\n\nKevin Brockway is The Gainesville Sun’s Florida beat writer.

In overtime, it was Sidney Crosby who scored the winner to help Pittsburgh get its fifth-straight win.\n\n“It felt great,” Rakell said postgame on Sunday. “We were pushing throughout the whole period there, and we felt like we were close so many times. But their goalie (Jet Greaves) played a really good game for them, and didn’t make it easy for us. But everybody on our team did such a good job tonight.”\n\nRakell believes the Penguins are coming together as a team, and the winning streak is a big part of it.\n\n“I think I just like our whole team game,” Rakell said. “Everybody knows that they’re very important part of us having success, and when everybody is doing their job every night, I think it gives us a good chance to win.”\n\nWith the win, the Penguins improved to 20-12-9 and are holding onto the top Wild Card spot. It was a great comeback win, which Pittsburgh believes can propel them.\n\n“It’s a great response by us,” goaltender Arturs Silovs said. “Guys are flying, we’re shooting, producing a lot of shots. Started to win a lot of offensive position, getting the changes and outworking them, and get rewarded.”\n\nPittsburgh will return to the ice on Thursday at home against the New Jersey Devils.\n\nMore Penguins: Dan Muse Praises Newly-Acquired Yegor Chinakhov After Recording First Penguins Goal\n\nThe post Sidney Crosby Helps Penguins Complete Comeback To Extend Win Streak appeared first on SportsNet Pittsburgh.",

    "fullText": "Moral injury—psychological harm incurred from committing, witnessing, or being subject to actions that violate one’s moral code—has officially been recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), thanks to research led by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. The APA included “moral problem” in the newest version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the handbook for classifying and diagnosing mental health conditions used by U.S. mental health care providers.\n\nIn a Sept. 16 Psychology Today article, Tyler VanderWeele, John L. Loeb and Frances Lehman Loeb Professor of Epidemiology and director of the Human Flourishing Program at Harvard (HFH), and Jennifer Wortham, a research associate at HFH, described their research on moral injury and subsequent work with the APA.\n\n“Over the past several years, [HFH has] been trying to develop a more unified approach to moral injury and to moral distress that would be applicable to perpetrators, witnesses, and victims,” they wrote. “After months of synthesis of prior work, we defined ‘moral distress’ as ‘distress that arises because personal experience disrupts or threatens: (a) one’s sense of the goodness of oneself, of others, of institutions, or of what are understood to be higher powers, or (b) one’s beliefs or intuitions about right and wrong, or good and evil.’ When that distress became sufficiently persistent it would constitute ‘moral injury.’”\n\nVanderWeele and Wortham introduced this definition, and the research behind it, in a March 4 Frontiers in Psychology study. The study sparked collaboration with the APA to ensure that moral injury was incorporated into the DSM.\n\n“Our hope is that [inclusion in the DSM] opens important opportunities for awareness and treatment of moral trauma, moral distress, and moral injury,” VanderWeele and Wortham wrote in the Psychology Today article. “If we are to truly provide person-centered care, the very real possibility of moral distress and moral injury needs to be acknowledged. The present recognition within psychiatry is a step forward in this regard.”\n\nRead the study: Moral trauma, moral distress, moral injury, and moral injury disorder: definitions and assessments\n\nRead the Psychology Today article: The Importance of Recognizing Moral Trauma in Clinical Care\n\nRead an HFH press release: DSM recognizes moral injury, thanks to Human Flourishing Program research\n\nMedia Relations Manager in the Office of Communications",

    "title": "What is Delta Force? The elite US special ops unit reported to be at the center of the raid to capture Venezuela's Maduro",
    "description": "The US's highly elite but secretive Delta Force captures and eliminates high-value targets. They reportedly helped capture Venezuela's Maduro.",
    "fullText": "At the center of the US operation that captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife was an elite and secretive special operations group, per multiple reports.\n\nCiting officials, outlets like The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Delta Force, alongside law enforcement personnel, carried out the extraction of Maduro as part of Operation Absolute Resolve, a surprise nighttime raid of the Venezuelan leader's compound in Caracas.\n\nBusiness Insider wasn't able to independently confirm the participation of the elite unit in the operation. The Pentagon directed BI's queries to the White House.\n\nIn discussions of the complex operation, President Donald Trump said only that it was executed by \"the most highly trained soldiers in the world,\" adding that \"there's nobody that has their talent.\"\n\nThe president may have been speaking about all of the personnel involved. US officials said that the operation to grab Maduro included land, air, sea, space, cyber, and intelligence forces. But Trump's language could easily apply to Delta Force, a top-tier special operations unit.\n\nHere is what we know about this elite force.\n\nDelta Force, officially known as the 1st Special Forces Operational Detachment-Delta (SFOD-D), is tasked with capturing and eliminating high-value targets. Like other tier-one special mission units, such as SEAL Team 6, Delta Force tackles some of the US Army's most covert and complex tasks.\n\nThe special operations unit, founded by Col. Charlie Beckwith in the 1970s for direct combat action, unconventional warfare, and counterterrorism, is headquartered at Fort Bragg in North Carolina, also home to other Army special operations forces.\n\nOperators train for rapid infiltration and exfiltration, intense close-quarters combat, precision marksmanship, demolition, hostage rescue, and more. Unlike some other units, Delta pulls the best warfighters it can from across the US armed forces, though it mainly draws from Army special operations forces. Known as \"quiet professionals,\" Delta Force operators generally do not speak openly about their activities.\n\nMuch of the elite force's work is highly classified, but some Delta missions are public knowledge.\n\nDelta Force was involved in the US operation, Just Cause, that ultimately led to the capture of Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega during the 1989 invasion of Panama. And the group distinguished itself during the 1993 Battle of Mogadishu, made famous by the book and film \"Black Hawk Down.\" Two snipers were posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions.\n\nThis century, this unit was among the US special operations forces that surged into Afghanistan immediately after the 9/11 attacks, played a role in the 2003 capture of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and was involved in the death of the infamous Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in 2019.\n\nAnd now reporting indicates Delta Force, along with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment, was instrumental in capturing Maduro.\n\nThe US president and other US officials shared details of the raid that captured Maduro on Saturday.\n\nDan Caine, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the apprehension team broke into a fortified compound to capture Maduro after months of planning. US intelligence agencies watched and studied his patterns of life, while other teams trained for the operation on a replica of Maduro's home. The US used a similar tactic to ready for the 2011 raid on Osama bin Laden's compound.\n\nReports indicate Delta Force was inserted into the target area by the 160th SOAR, the Night Stalkers famous for their ability to get special operators in and out of tough spots.\n\nWith fighters, bombers, electronic warfare planes, and more delivering strikes and providing air cover, Caine said the helicopters carrying the extraction team were able to reach their target with \"totally the element of surprise.\"\n\nDuring the complex apprehension operation, American operators moved fast through the building to find Maduro and his wife, seizing them before they could get the door closed on a steel safe room.\n\nTrump said that Venezuela's military was overwhelmed by US forces. Several American personnel were injured, the president said, and one of the helicopters was hit but remained flyable. No troops or equipment were lost in the operation.\n\nThe Trump administration is holding Maduro responsible for supporting narco-terrorism (drug trafficking) and other criminal activity. The recent operation is also about oil, with the administration accusing Venezuela of using oil revenue to fund malign activities. Maduro has denied the allegations.\n\nTrump said on Saturday that the US would run Venezuela until a \"safe, proper\" election could occur. He also said that US oil companies would be entering the country, which has the world's largest proven crude oil reserves.\n\nTo secure these operations, he said that he's not ruling out putting US troops on the ground. He said the US military is ready to conduct more attacks if needed.\n\nUS Attorney General Pamela Bondi said Maduro and his wife were charged in New York with drug and weapons offenses. He is due to appear in court.",

    "title": "I left McKinsey in my 20s for startup life. Being a founder taught me to stop overanalyzing and speak up more.",
    "description": "A former McKinsey consultant shares what he had to unlearn from consulting to succeed in startup life.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nathan Wangliao Yinan, the CEO and cofounder of Singapore-based AI startup Havana. The conversation has been edited for length and clarity. Business Insider has verified his employment history.\n\nAfter university, I didn't have the risk appetite to start something immediately. I joined McKinsey in the UK in 2018 because they actively encouraged me to do something different after two years there.\n\nI was at McKinsey for slightly under three years. I met a lot of people who were from different walks of life, and that made me feel it's OK to go and do different things.\n\nMy first manager had been a doctor in the UK who left practice because she felt the healthcare system was broken. She joined McKinsey to do healthcare work. One of my favorite bosses had been in the US Marines and went to Iraq. He did an MBA and joined the firm after that.\n\nI moved back to Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and McKinsey became less fun because everything was remote. The thing I enjoyed most — the people — began to decline.\n\nI knew I wanted to start something, but I realized I was pushing it off because it was hard to make a move during the pandemic. At some point, it felt like I was doing my job out of inertia.\n\nI left McKinsey in 2021 at the age of 27 and worked at a Singapore-based AI startup for two years, leading the go-to-market strategy.\n\nI went from being in a huge office with all kinds of perks to being in a coworking space with just two other people, and we had to figure everything out from scratch.\n\nI told my founder in the first month, \"Maybe I should just go back to McKinsey because this feels too scary.\" I don't know if the company will be around in a year. What if I need to look for a job?\n\nA lot of it is irrational because, honestly, we raised a lot of money, and we were a good company, and I'm sure I could find a job.\n\nThe startup was acquired in 2023, and I cofounded Havana, a startup specializing in AI agents for student recruitment and enrollment teams.\n\nI was told that the most important and hardest thing in a startup is managing my own psychology.\n\nIt's not learning how to build a new product or how to sell. If you are able to manage your psychology, then you will have the morale to learn all these things. As long as you work hard and you're capable, anyone can figure these things out. Most people, at some point, lose morale, or they just feel like it sucks too much.\n\nThere are a lot of things that can distract you. You can think, \"Oh, my other friends are doing X, Y, Z, and their life seems easier.\" You have to learn to shut down these distracting thoughts when you are in a career with a lot of openness and uncertainty.\n\nThe most important skill I learned at McKinsey is how to navigate clients.\n\nTypically, they are more senior and older than us. They have multiple departments, and you need to know how to run a meeting efficiently and understand everyone's needs. The startup that I'm running now sells to universities, which are bigger than us, so that's a useful skill.\n\nConsulting also trained me to be organized and structured. I learned to prioritize ruthlessly and do things fast because timelines are always tight.\n\nThere are also some things I had to unlearn. Consultants are trained to overanalyze and rely on data to figure out the most optimal solution. That's OK for big companies.\n\nIn a startup, when you're trying to make decisions, you'll never have enough data. You just have to have the guts to do one thing. If it doesn't work, go and do the second thing.\n\nWhen I first left consulting, I struggled with that. I would take a bit too long to try to get data, talk to more people, and read more books before choosing the right path.\n\nEarly on, we conducted customer interviews before building the product. My cofounder and I would spend a lot of time discussing: Is this the pain point we want to solve? Does this feel big enough? What's the first version of the product we should build?\n\nIt's very ambiguous, like trying to get some kind of instinct through research. Over time, we began building the product and attracting customers, and then a bit more rhythm emerged.\n\nNow, I don't feel like I have to have all the knowledge. I'm comfortable taking risks and making decisions.\n\nAs a startup founder, I've also gotten a lot more comfortable with speaking more. When I was at McKinsey, my managers would say I needed to speak up \n\nIf you run a business and are the only non-technical founder, you have to talk to customers every day. They expect you to show up with a point of view.\n\nDo you have a story to share about building a tech business in Asia? Contact this reporter at cmlee@insider.com.",

    "fullText": "Venezuela is home to over 300 billion barrels of proven crude oil — more than any other country in the world.\n\nThat's not the reason President Donald Trump gave, however, for the surprise raid on Venezuela on Saturday that netted its president, Nicolás Maduro, and his wife.\n\nThe Trump administration said Maduro's capture was a law enforcement operation. Maduro has been indicted on drug trafficking and weapons charges and is now awaiting his first hearing in a notorious Brooklyn jail.\n\nIn a press conference on Saturday, though, Trump said that with Maduro removed from the country, the US would now look to tap the country's oil reserves.\n\n\"We're going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump called Venezuela's oil business a \"bust\" and \"nothing by comparison to what they could have been pumping, and what could have taken place.\"\n\nWhile it's home to a fifth of the world's oil reserves, Venezuela accounts for less than 1% of global daily crude production.\n\nTake a look at how its reserves compare to other countries.

    "title": "From 'First Buddy' bromance to a feud to a thaw, here's how Elon Musk and Donald Trump's relationship has evolved",
    "description": "Donald Trump and Elon Musk have a complicated relationship. They've had some very public spats, but the two powerful men remain political allies.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk and Donald Trump appear to be back on after an on-again, off-again relationship over the years.\n\nThe world's richest person and the two-time president of the United States weren't always close, but became singular political allies, with Musk calling himself \"first buddy\" following Trump's 2024 victory and donating more than $200 million toward pro-Trump super PACs.\n\nAt the beginning of Trump's second term, Musk was frequently seen on the president's side and served as the de facto head of the White House DOGE office.\n\nIn June 2025, Trump and Musk's relationship blew up after Musk criticized Trump's signature \"Big Beautiful Bill.\" Musk even threatened to start his own political party. Trump threatened to \"destroy\" Musk's companies.\n\nTensions have cooled since then. Musk and Trump shook hands at Charlie Cook's memorial service in September, a reunion that Musk and the White House proudly shared on social media. In October 2025, Trump said he now had a \"good\" relationship with Musk.\n\n\"I like Elon, I've always liked him,\" Trump said.\n\nHere's how the two billionaires reached this point.\n\nJust before the 2016 presidential election, Musk told CNBC he didn't think Trump should be president.\n\n\"I feel a bit stronger that he is not the right guy. He doesn't seem to have the sort of character that reflects well on the United States,\" Musk said.\n\nThe billionaire added that Hillary Clinton's economic and environmental policies were the \"right ones.\"\n\nAfter he won the presidency, Trump appointed Musk to two economic advisory councils, along with other business leaders like then Uber CEO Travis Kalanick.\n\nMusk received criticism for working with the controversial president, but he defended his choice by saying he was using the position to lobby for better environmental and immigration policies.\n\nOn June 1, 2017, after Trump announced the US would pull out of the Paris Agreement on climate change, Musk resigned from his roles on presidential advisory boards.\n\n\"Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world,\" Musk said in a tweet announcing his departure.\n\nMusk's goal for Tesla is to curb dependence on fossil fuels through electric vehicles, solar power, and stationary energy storage.\n\nDuring a January 2020 interview with CNBC, Trump praised Musk's accomplishments and intelligence.\n\n\"You have to give him credit,\" the former president said, referring to Tesla becoming more valuable than Ford and General Motors. \"He's also doing the rockets. He likes rockets. And he's doing good at rockets too, by the way.\"\n\nTrump called Musk \"one of our great geniuses\" and likened him to Thomas Edison.\n\nAs the pandemic gripped the US in early 2020, Musk clashed with California public-health officials who forced Tesla to temporarily shut down its factory there. Trump voiced his support for Musk.\n\n\"California should let Tesla & @elonmusk open the plant, NOW,\" Trump tweeted in May 2020. \"It can be done Fast & Safely!\"\n\nIn May 2022, Musk said he would unban Trump as Twitter's new owner.\n\nMusk called the ban a \"morally bad decision\" and \"foolish to the extreme\" in an interview with the Financial Times. Twitter kicked Trump off its platform following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol.\n\nThe Tesla billionaire has called himself a \"free speech absolutist,\" and one of his key goals for taking Twitter private was to loosen content moderation.\n\nIn July 2022, Trump took aim at Musk, saying the businessman voted for him but later denied it.\n\n\"You know [Musk] said the other day 'Oh, I've never voted for a Republican,'\" Trump said during a Saturday rally in Anchorage, Alaska. \"I said 'I didn't know that.' He told me he voted for me. So he's another bullshit artist.\"\n\nDays later, Musk tweeted that Trump's claim was \"not true.\"\n\nMusk stopped short of attacking Trump personally, but said he shouldn't run for president again.\n\n\"I don't hate the man, but it's time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset. Dems should also call off the attack – don't make it so that Trump's only way to survive is to regain the Presidency,\" he tweeted.\n\nHe continued: \"Do we really want a bull in a china shop situation every single day!? Also, I think the legal maximum age for start of Presidential term should be 69.\" Trump is 76 years old.\n\nSoon after, Trump went on the offensive, posting a lengthy attack on Musk on Truth Social.\n\n\"When Elon Musk came to the White House asking me for help on all of his many subsidized projects, whether it's electric cars that don't drive long enough, driverless cars that crash, or rocketships to nowhere, without which subsidies he'd be worthless, and telling me how he was a big Trump fan and Republican, I could have said, 'drop to your knees and beg,' and he would have done it,\" Trump said in a post that criticized two of Musk's ventures, Tesla and the rocket company SpaceX.\n\n\"Lmaooo,\" Musk responded on Twitter.\n\nFollowing Musk's official purchase of Twitter in October 2022, Trump applauded the deal.\n\n\"I am very happy that Twitter is now in sane hands, and will no longer be run by Radical Left Lunatics and Maniacs that truly hate our country,\" he said. He added that he likes Truth Social better than other platforms, echoing comments from earlier this year in which he ruled out a return to Twitter.\n\nMusk later joked about the potential of welcoming the former president back to his newly acquired platform.\n\n\"If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if Trump is coming back on this platform, Twitter would be minting money!,\" the Tesla CEO tweeted in October 2022.\n\nMusk and other right-leaning voices in Silicon Valley initially supported Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. DeSantis ended 2022 as Trump's best-positioned primary challenger. In November 2022, as DeSantis was skyrocketing to acclaim, Musk said he would endorse him. In March 2023, after enduring Trump's attacks for months, DeSantis prepared to make history by formally announcing his candidacy in an interview on Twitter.\n\nThe initial few minutes were a glitchy disaster. Trump and his allies ruthlessly mocked DeSantis' \"Space\" with Musk and venture capitalist David Sachs. DeSantis' interview later proceeded, but his campaign was dogged for days with negative headlines.\n\nMusk live-streamed a visit to the US-Mexico border on Twitter, which he had rebranded as \"X.\" Musk offered his support for one of Trump's signature immigration policies.\n\n\"We actually do need a wall and we need to require people to have some shred of evidence to claim asylum to enter, as everyone is doing that,\" Musk wrote on X. \"It's a hack that you can literally Google to know exactly what to say! Will find out more when I visit Eagle Pass maybe as soon as tomorrow.\"\n\nTrump tried to woo Musk during a meeting at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort. According to The New York Times, Trump met with Musk and a few other GOP megadonors when the former president's campaign was particularly cash-strapped. After the Times published its report, Musk said he would not be \"donating money to either candidate for US President.\"\n\nMusk said he \"fully endorsed\" Trump after the former president was shot during a political rally ahead of the Republican National Convention. Musk's endorsement marked a major turning point in his yearslong political evolution from an Obama voter. Days later, it would come to light that Musk pressed Trump to select Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his running mate.\n\nTrump announced Vance as his vice presidential pick at the Republican National Convention.\n\nThe ticket, Musk wrote on X, \"resounds with victory.\"\n\nTrump, who ended the Republican National Convention primed for victory, stumbled after Biden abruptly dropped out of the 2024 race. He and his allies have struggled to attack Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee.\n\nAmid Harris' early media blitz, Trump joined Musk on a two-hour livestream on X that garnered an audience of over 1 million listeners. The conversation covered topics ranging from a retelling of Trump's assassination attempt to illegal immigration to Musk's potential role with a government efficiency commission.\n\nIn August, Trump began to suggest that he \"certainly would\" consider adding Musk to his Cabinet or an advisory role. The Tesla CEO responded by tweeting an AI-generated photo of himself on a podium emblazoned with the acronym \"D.O.G.E\"—Department of Government Efficiency.\n\n\"I am willing to serve,\" he wrote above the image.\n\nIn September 2024, Trump softened the possibility that Musk might join his Cabinet suggestion of Musk joining his Cabinet. However, he also said that Musk could \"consult with the country\" and help give \"some very good ideas.\"\n\nMusk later expressed enthusiasm about the news.\n\n\"I can't wait. There is a lot of waste and needless regulation in government that needs to go,\" he wrote on X.\n\nHe later added that he \"looked forward to serving\" the country and would be willing to do with without any pay, title, or recognition.\n\nMusk joined Trump onstage during the former president's rally, hosted on October 5 in the same location where Trump survived an assassination attempt in July 2024. Musk sported an all-black \"Make America Great Again\" cap and briefly addressed the crowd, saying that voter turnout for Trump this year was essential or \"this will be the last election.\"\n\n\"President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution,\" Musk said. \"He must win to preserve democracy in America.\"\n\nThe next day, Musk's America PAC announced that it would offer $47 to each person who refers registered voters residing in swing states to sign a petition \"in support for the First and Second Amendments.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO later told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that he might face \"vengeance\" if Trump loses the election.\n\nMusk was by Trump's side on election night at Mar-a-Lago, helping celebrate his victory.\n\nNearly a week after his 2024 presidential election win, Trump announced that Musk and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy were chosen to lead a newly minted Department of Government Efficiency (or DOGE, as Musk liked to call it, in reference to the meme-inspired cryptocurrency Dogecoin).\n\n\"Together, these two wonderful Americans will pay the way for my Administration to dismantle the Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures, and restructure Federal Agencies,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nOutside of administrative duties, Musk's presence at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club was so constant that Trump joked he couldn't \"get rid of him.\"\n\n\"Elon won't go home,\" Trump told NBC News jokingly\n\nThe pair's close relationship grew into a more personal friendship. Musk was seen attending Trump's Thanksgiving dinner and on the golf course with Trump and his grandchildren, where Kai Trump said he achieved \"uncle status.\"\n\nTrump dismissed concerns that Musk would be running the country, adding in a barb that the billionaire couldn't even be in charge if he wanted to, since he was born in South Africa.\n\n\"No, he's not going to be president, that I can tell you,\" Trump said in December 2024. \"And I'm safe. You know why? He can't be? He wasn't born in this country.\"\n\nTrump's comments came after Musk flexed his influence to help shut down a bipartisan emergency spending bill earlier that month. Some Republicans questioned why Trump hadn't been more active in derailing the bill, and Democrats baited the President-elect on social media with posts about Musk \"calling the shots\" and taking on the role of a \"shadow president.\n\nTrump was sworn into office on January 20. Several tech leaders were in attendance, including Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, and Google's Sundar Pichai. The \"first buddy\" was also front and center for Trump's inauguration.\n\nMusk took the stage to celebrate at an inauguration event at the Capital One Arena, where he sparked accusations over a gesture he made that some said resembled a Nazi salute. Musk denied the allegations.\n\n\"Hopefully, people realize I'm not a Nazi. Just to be clear, I'm not a Nazi,\" he said during an interview with Joe Rogan.\n\nThough Musk quickly became the face of the DOGE effort, White House court filings said he had \"no actual or formal authority to make government decisions himself.\"\n\nIn the February 2025 filing, Musk was described as a senior advisor to Trump with \"no greater authority than other senior White House advisors.\" Officials also called him a \"special government employee.\"\n\nTrump told reporters they can call Musk \"whatever you want.\"\n\nThe White House later named Amy Gleason, who previously worked for US Digital Service, as the acting DOGE administrator.\n\nMusk's companies struggled to escape the almost daily DOGE-related news cycles.\n\nProtests, boycotts, and vandalism at Tesla dealerships spread across the US.\n\nIn March, Trump stepped in to defend Musk's electric car company, with Teslas on the South Lawn of the White House. Trump later wrote that he'd purchased a Tesla to show support for Musk.\n\n\"The Radical Left Lunatics, as they often do, are trying to illegally and collusively boycott Tesla, one of the World's great automakers, and Elon's 'baby,' in order to attack and do harm to Elon, and everything he stands for,\" he wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThree months into DOGE's mission to reshape the federal workforce, Musk announced that he would be stepping back from the effort. He broke the news during an underwhelming Tesla earnings call, where earnings per share were down 71% year over year.\n\n\"Starting next month, I will be allocating far more of my time to Tesla,\" Musk said during the call. He added that \"the major work of establishing the Department of Government Efficiency\" had been completed.\n\nAt the time, Musk said he would keep spending one or two days each week on governmental duties, so long as Trump wanted him to do so.\n\nOn June 30, Musk doubled down on his calls for another political party. He also vowed to defeat politicians who support Trump's bill.\n\n\"They will lose their primary next year if it is the last thing I do on this Earth,\" Musk wrote on X.\n\nTrump responded on July 1 on Truth Social, suggesting that DOGE could be turned on its former chief.\n\n\"Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE,\" he wrote.\n\nMusk followed up with more posts on X proclaiming his opposition to the spending bill.\n\nTrump signed his signature bill on July 4, 2025.\n\nOn July 5, Musk said on X that he had formed the America Party to \"give you back your freedom.\"\n\nTrump responded on Truth Social that he was \"saddened\" to see Musk go \"completely 'off the rails,'\" essentially becoming a \"TRAIN WRECK over the past five weeks.\" Trump added that third political parties have never succeeded.\n\nLate in the month, Trump said that even though his signature domestic plan slashes EV subsidies, he's not out to hurt Musk's bottom line.\n\n\"Everyone is stating that I will destroy Elon's companies by taking away some, if not all, of the large-scale subsidies he receives from the U.S. Government,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"This is not so! I want Elon, and all businesses within our Country, to THRIVE, in fact, THRIVE like never before!\"\n\nTrump's statement came a day after the White House appeared to suggest that federal agencies shouldn't contract with Musk's xAI.\n\nTrump and Musk were seen for the first time since their public falling out at the memorial service for conservative commentator Charlie Kirk.\n\nTrump, Vice President JD Vance, and a host of other top White House officials joined together in Arizona to pay tribute to Kirk, who was killed while speaking at Utah Valley University.\n\nMusk and the White House later posted photos of the meet-up on X.\n\nTrump said that Musk came over \"to say hello.\"\n\n\"I thought it was nice, he came over, we had a little conversation,\" Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One after the memorial service. \"We had a very good relationship but it was nice that he came over. \"\n\nPOTUS x @ElonMusk \n\nFor Charlie. pic.twitter.com/Inaf8X81Gy\n\nMusk had previously said that the White House had invited him to an exclusive dinner for tech CEOs but was unable to attend.\n\nTrump said he and Musk had a \"good\" relationship and called their brief feud \"a stupid moment.\"\n\n\"He had a bad spell, he had a bad period. He had a bad moment,\" Trump told reporters when asked about their relationship. \"It was a stupid moment in his life, very stupid. I'm sure he'd tell you that. But I like Elon, and I suspect I always will.\"\n\nThe Tesla CEO still has beefs elsewhere. In late October, Musk called Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy a \"dummy\" amid a spat over who would lead NASA.\n\nTrump invited Musk to attend a dinner at the White House with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in November. The event marks Musk's first public appearance at the White House since stepping back from the DOGE office in May 2025.\n\nThe guest list for the dinner included prominent CEOs such as Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Apple CEO Tim Cook. Musk shared a photo of the event on X, which included himself, Trump, the crown prince, and Huang.\n\n\"I would like to thank President Trump for all he has done for America and the world,\" Musk wrote.\n\nOne day after the dinner, Trump joked about Musk in a speech at the US-Saudi Investment Forum.\n\n\"You're so lucky I'm with you, Elon. I'll tell you. Has he ever thanked me properly?\" Trump said.\n\nHours after news broke that the US had raided Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro and his wife on January 3, Elon Musk posted his support.\n\n\"Congratulations, President Trump! This is a win for the world and a clear message to evil dictators everywhere,\" he wrote on X.\n\n\"It is heartwarming to see so many Venezuelans celebrating their country freed from a brutal tyrant,\" he posted again. \"Venezuela can now have the prosperity it deserves.\"\n\nThat same evening, Musk posted that he had a \"lovely dinner\" with Trump and Melania Trump, along with a photo of the three of them seated at a table at Mar-a-Lago.",

I wish the players and those involved the best as they move forward, but for me, this chapter is now closed.\"\n\nBBC Sport has contacted the PTPA for comment.",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nEmi Martinez (Aston Villa): It is going to sound very strange because it was a very comfortable Aston Villa win, but he made some key saves from Morgan Gibbs-White in the second half - just after Nottingham Forest got a goal back and it went to 2-1. He just kept them in the game.\n\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa): He was excellent. He has been excellent for a few weeks now but a massive outlet for Aston Villa. When they are dominant on the ball, he's the outlet on the right-hand side and got a lovely little assist in there as well. He is the main outlet and he really jumps off the pitch when you are watching the games.\n\nMalick Thiaw (Newcastle): From November onwards, he has been exceptional. He had a tough time in Italy but he is delivering consistently now. He scores a goal, which always helps for any defender in this team of the week. Solid performance, delivered, was more aggressive and I feel like he is starting to get his bearings now and feel like he is the man at Newcastle.\n\nNathan Collins (Brentford): Goal and an assist with the flick-on. I just think when they first signed him from Wolves, I didn't get it. Now I do. Especially under Keith Andrews. He organises well, he moves the ball really strongly from the back. He is the leader of that team. Forget Jordan Henderson, he is the leader of that team. Obviously goals help at centre-back.\n\nBen Davies (Tottenham): I don't think this is a name I ever thought I was going to put in but Ben Davies, fair play to him. He plays only his third game of the season, starts, they had Djed Spence on the bench as well - which shows the level of professionalism and maturity that he continues to deliver - and he gets a goal. It just shows to me that you don't always have to be 37 and written off. He's 32 and he's already been written off, he's got a World Cup to hopefully go to with Wales. He is always fit and available, which is what I really like.\n\nDeclan Rice (Arsenal): Two goals, leader, future England captain - do we need to say anything else?\n\nMateus Mane (Wolves): Eighteen years old, England youth international, doesn't have any noise, hasn't got any brothers with T-shirts saying to 'free him and let him play'. He goes out, plays, scores goals, gets an assist, gets the penalty and just delivers with no fuss. How beautiful is that? No fuss. I saw his interview after the game, he doesn't complain, doesn't get too over the top, just simple. Love it.\n\nJohn McGinn (Aston Villa): He obviously has to be in here. Two goals, the second goal he is obviously buzzing because the keeper made it so easy for him - but it feels like he has had a love-hate relationship with Unai Emery for about three years now. It has started to come to fruition. He has been a really important piece for this Aston Villa side.\n\nTijjani Reijnders (Manchester City): He gets a goal and it probably should have been the match-winner for Man City if we are being totally honest. They will feel like they should have won that game. Reijnders has got three goals in his last four matches and that shows his importance. He is growing. He had a really good start and then I think the reality of English football caught up with him for a period, but now he has got his second wind and he is playing well. He is going to be really important if City are to try to catch Arsenal.\n\nIgor Thiago (Brentford): Like me, you probably took him out of your fantasy football team thinking he had fallen off a cliff, and then he has scored every week since. So that just basically says more about my fantasy football managerial ability more than anything to do with his performances! But he is the rock, the leader, making sure he is right up there for that conversation for Brazil with the World Cup squad. You've got Joao Pedro, Richarlison, Gabriel Jesus - these are the guys who are all being spoken about. Even Neymar, but he's the one with the most goals, he is the one delivering with the most performances week in, week out. I'm backing him to make the squad.\n\nCody Gakpo (Liverpool): It was a game where Liverpool will feel they should have won it, nicking it in the 94th minute and then obviously Fulham score in the 97th minute. I think it is just one of those moments where you look at the team and you think no Hugo Ekitike, no Alexander Isak, who is going to step up and score the goals? To be fair to him, he's done it all season and that's why he goes in.\n\nRob Edwards (Wolves): First win for Wolves, a massive game against West Ham. I think in those games, because I have played in them, you need your manager to be resolute. To get you up but not get you over the edge and I think he just had both the tactics and emotion of the game spot on. Didn't go over the needle, didn't go under it and his team obviously delivered a massive 3-0 victory which gives them a fight - because if they had lost that game, relegation would have been all done and dusted. Now, hopefully they can get another win in the week and build on that momentum. For right now, it's huge for him and thankfully it is the first time we say something positive about Wolves all season - so massive kudos to Rob and his team.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections?

This stadium is not a happy place – and Frank is failing to provide the style or substance to change things.",

So, is it then a surprise?\" the Dutchman said.\n\nWhat did surprise many inside Craven Cottage was that Wirtz's equaliser was confirmed after a video assistant referee (VAR) check - despite replays suggesting he was in an offside position.\n\n\"I was sure it was offside so I didn't even celebrate,\" Wirtz told Sky Sports.\n\n\"I felt the same. Many people inside the stadium felt the same,\" said Silva. \"It looked offside, but we have to believe the semi-automated technology worked well and did right,\" the Fulham boss added.",

    "fullText": "Former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury has announced he will return to boxing in 2026, bringing an end to his latest spell of retirement.\n\nThe 37-year-old Briton last fought in December 2024, when he was beaten for a second time by unified champion Oleksandr Usyk in their heavyweight rematch. Fury confirmed his retirement a month later.\n\nSpeculation over a comeback had grown in recent weeks after Fury shared footage of himself training in Thailand alongside South African boxer Kevin Lerena.\n\nPosting on Instagram on Sunday, Fury said: \"2026 is that year. Return of the Mac. Been away for a while but I'm back now. 37 years old and still punching. Nothing better to do than punch men in the face & get paid for it.\"\n\nFury's return to the ring was widely expected. His most recent retirement was met with scepticism last year, given his history of reversals.\n\nHe previously stepped away from boxing after stopping Dillian Whyte at Wembley Stadium in April 2022, only to return six months later.\n\nQueensberry promoter Frank Warren said he expected Fury to fight again. Saudi Arabia powerbroker Turki Alalshikh had reportedly planned for Fury and long-time rival Anthony Joshua to take separate bouts in the Kingdom early in 2026 before finally meeting later in the year.\n\nJoshua fuelled that possibility after defeating Jake Paul in December, saying he was ready to face Fury next.\n\nThose plans are now uncertain after Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria that claimed the lives of two close friends.\n\nFury enjoyed two reigns as heavyweight champion and boasts a professional record of 34 wins, two defeats - both against Usyk - and one draw with Deontay Wilder.\n\nHe stunned long-reigning champion Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 to claim the WBA (Super), IBF, WBO and The Ring heavyweight titles in Germany.\n\nAfter more than two and a half years away from the ring, during which he addressed mental health struggles, Fury returned in 2018 and regained world champion status by defeating Wilder in 2020 to win the WBC title.\n\nFury has spoken openly about wanting to avenge his defeats by Usyk, who currently holds the WBA (Super), WBC and IBF belts.\n\nThere appears to be limited appetite among fans for a trilogy, while the Ukrainian has indicated he would prefer to defend his titles against Wilder next.\n\nOne potential route to world-title contention could be a domestic clash with Fabio Wardley, the current WBO champion and another fighter promoted by Warren's Queensberry stable.",

    "title": "How the sugar industry bought out scientists for decades",
    "description": "Researchers followed the money, and found out that the sugar industry has been gaslighting the entire world for fifty years. It was code-named \"Project 226.\"",
    "fullText": "According to a report just published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, a delegation from the Sugar Research Foundation paid off Harvard scientists to produce reports that falsely downplayed the role of sugar in coronary heart disease.\n\nYep. Sugar contributes to coronary artery disease, more than we have been led to believe.\n\nReports had linked both dietary sugar and dietary fat to heart disease as early as the mid-50s; by 1960 we knew that low-fat diets high in sugars still resulted in high cholesterol levels. So in 1964, the director of the SRF proposed that the group \"embark on a major program\" to dispute the data as well as any \"negative attitudes toward sugar.\" They found a group of Harvard nutrition scientists who would take their money, and started making plans.\n\nComplete with a codename, Project 226 was designed to protect the interests of the sugar industry by \"recapturing\" the 20% of American calorie intake they expected to lose once this whole sugar-isn't-great-for-your-heart thing percolated through into public awareness. It resulted in a two-part review published in the prestigious and influential New England Journal of Medicine, which hand-waved away huge swathes of research pointing out the risks of dietary sugar.\n\nThe authors went to absurd lengths to discount studies that didn't tell the story the Sugar Research Foundation wanted to tell. For example, to get the results they wanted, they had to throw out all the studies done on animals, because not a single animal study supported the conclusion they wanted. But after they finished their work, they reported that epidemiological studies showed a positive association between high dietary sugar consumption and better heart disease outcomes. The review concluded that there was \"no doubt\" that the only way to avoid heart disease was to reduce saturated fat.\n\nHow did this get past the sanity check at NEJM? The authors were experts, respected in their fields, and they were at least consistent cherry-pickers. They also conveniently failed to report that the Sugar Research Foundation funded their \"study.\" NEJM didn't start requiring authors to report conflicts of interest until 1984, and by then the sugar industry had floated comfortably on their 1964 precedent, funding study after study supporting their pro-sugar narrative \"as a main prop of the industry's defense.\"\n\nCan we finally talk about industry-funded studies? I'm not saying that scientists shouldn't be able to work for private research establishments. Obviously the money to buy the pipettes and reagents has to come from somewhere. But I am saying that there needs to be an unpleasantly bright spotlight on the financial resources enabling the scientific findings cited to support policymaking, whether political or medical. What industry would ever pay to support research that would put it out of business? Whether or not you're in favor of industry self-regulation, no matter whether the research is funded by taxes, commercial revenue, or charitable sources, everyone deserves policies that are made based on the whole truth -- not based on a callously selective interpretation of the facts that ends up lining someone's pockets at the expense of others' health. After how many deaths or lost person-years do the industry payoffs start being blood money?\n\nI for one, as a bench scientist, am mightily tired of hearing about scientists taking money to produce the right conclusion. This is the kind of crap Bill Nye was railing against in his comments that the industry barons who pay off scientists to fit the results to the desired conclusions maybe should be thrown in jail. It's prima facie fraud.\n\nThe peer-reviewed paper in which the scientists make this report is freely available from the JAMA(Opens in a new window), and that's how it ought to be. The only solution to corruption in science is to get more critical eyes on the whole process. There needs to be an independent body of investigative experts accountable to the public, who have to submit to a zealous and hard-hitting inquiry into their financial interests, and who can serve as a sanity check for advisory boards or legislative committees.\n\nWe need a Mythbusters for medical advice: someone who isn't a wholly owned subsidiary of the industry. Someone who can turn on the lights and force the roaches of corruption to scatter. Pay-to-win gaming isn't fair, and people hate it, and pay-to-win science is just as bad. It's about time to start paying the skeptics, because an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.\n\nBut the only way we can do the above is if the science is accessible. How much do you think a subscription to every major scientific journal would cost, even at the discounted academic rate? The EU's Horizon 2020 directive provided hosting and access that made freely available all research funded even in part by EU money -- while the authors retain the right to license, patent or commercialize their work, the peer-reviewed papers reporting their results are now free, as in libre and gratis. When they publish in Nature or wherever, they also have to publish in the European Research Council's public database.\n\nWe should do that in the US, because hosting is cheap. Then maybe we could afford to hire people like Penn and Teller, Adam and Jamie, or Phil Plait and James Randi: people with faces we know and judgment we've checked, people whose stock in trade it is to root out misunderstandings and weasel words. Policy grounded in research needs to be officially subjected to the kind of person who just can't stand it when someone is wrong on the internet. Give us some accountability and tear down this paywall.\n\nResearch: doi:10.1001/jamainternmed.2016.5394",

    "description": "Our 2nd most-read article of 2025.\n- - -It’s so easy to label people these days. From the way folks have been talking, you’d think everyone falls ...",
    "fullText": "Our 2nd most-read article of 2025.\n\nIt’s so easy to label people these days. From the way folks have been talking, you’d think everyone falls into two buckets: those who voted against the mayor who promised to blow up the city and those who voted for the mayor who promised to blow up the city. And now that the mayor, whom I voted for, is blowing up the city, as he promised, I’m one of many people who are being unfairly blamed for something I didn’t want. Okay? I didn’t want the mayor to blow up the city like he mentioned many times; I just wanted him to fix the old bowling alley like he promised in passing once. Anyone saying I’m partially responsible for the explosions is just a sign that they have no argument.\n\nBefore you rush to cancel me, try to remember the mayor made lots of promises, and I didn’t expect him to keep them all. Yes, he promised to turn our playgrounds to glass and take a blowtorch to the schools; yes, he said that he was going to use napalm on every grocery store, but, as I said, he also promised he was going to fix the old bowling alley.\n\nOh, how I loved that bowling alley as a kid. It’s been closed for twenty years, so when the mayor mentioned he’d fix it if we elected him, I had to give it a chance. To be fair, he was also the mayor a few years ago, made the same promise, and failed to fix the bowling alley then. But he did live up to his promise to reintroduce smallpox into local daycares, so at least you know he can get things done, unlike the other guy who did neither of those.\n\nI’ve seen all the attacks online. You use the mayor’s own clear statements of purpose against me just because I consciously chose this. “The mayor said he was going to blow up the city.” Yeah, metaphorically. “The mayor brought up his desire to see the residents of the city cleansed by flame in every speech.” Sure, if you take it out of context, maybe. “The mayor’s election slogan was, ‘Blow It All Up and Watch Them Suffer,’” which is scary only for people stupid enough to take him seriously. The fact that he had to go so far as to pour gasoline all over the Burger King before throwing a Molotov cocktail through the window shows what his opponents have pushed him to do. It’s really his critics that have kept him from fixing the bowling alley.\n\nLet me reiterate: I do not approve of the mayor locking the doors of the mall and igniting a bus full of C4 in the food court. I may have worn a shirt that said, VOTE FOR THE MAYOR WHO WILL BLOW UP THE MALL FOOD COURT, but that was just my fun way of saying I only cared about the bowling alley. It makes me sad that you think I wanted people to get hurt by this. Especially when it’s something that directly affected me for the first time in my life, when my nephew was accidentally trapped in that mall when it exploded. Give me a little grace here. Plus, my nephew voted for the other candidate, so it’s kind of his fault that he ended up there to begin with.\n\nIs it so bad that I wanted the bowling alley back? Maybe that’s what you’re really mad about. You wanted the mayor to fail. The negativity around the smell of roasting pig is just a facile attempt to distract from his potential future successes. I bet the mayor is about to fix up the bowling alley, and I’ll walk in, and I’ll be twelve again, and all the adults will be so tall, and it will be my party, and everyone—even the kids who don’t like me—will have to sing happy birthday. The previous mayor said that rebuilding the bowling alley wouldn’t make it 1996 again, which, to me, is unacceptable.\n\nIt’s disgusting and, frankly, counterproductive to point out that I voted for this. To imply that I had personal free will and agency when I walked into a voting booth and picked Mayor Bomberman is insulting. Here I am, admitting that I did not actually want the mayor’s biggest promise to happen, and you’re criticizing me for directly being part of the reason it’s happening. You should be praising me for being able to admit that—well, not that I was wrong, heaven forbid—but perhaps my faith in the mayor who was arrested thirty-four times for arson was misplaced.\n\nAt the end of the day, you can imply that I “wanted this” as much as you like. You don’t know what’s inside my heart. The mayor said he’d fix the bowling alley. Just because he hasn’t fixed the bowling alley and announced that he’ll never fix the bowling alley, doesn’t mean I’m dumb or a fool. And while he may have also promised he’d re-segregate the city, crash the city’s economy, and turn the city’s only remaining functional hospital into a big Jersey Mike’s, I can guarantee that I only wanted the Jersey Mike’s.\n\nSo, no, I’m not “happy now” that our zoo has been turned into an open-air animal mausoleum. But of the options I had, only one mayor promised to completely change the city. And you know what? At least he is doing something. It may kill a lot of people. It may leave others without homes or jobs. But I respect a man of action, regardless of what that action is and whether or not it’s going to make things better or worse.\n\nNow, I’ll just sit back and wait for the bowling alley to get fixed.\n\nMike Drucker’s new book, Good Game, No Rematch, combines ridiculous personal stories and fascinating gaming history to explore the poignant ways that electronic entertainment can save us from ourselves. Or humiliate us, case depending.",

    "description": "Warren Buffett has officially stepped down as CEO of Berkshire Hathaway. Investors are focused on what happens to the company's growing cash pile.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-B, BRK-A) entered a new era at the start of 2026 as legendary investor Warren Buffett officially handed the reins as CEO to his protégé, Greg Abel.\n\nBuffett leaves behind stunning realized returns of 6,100,000% over the past 60 years, built on his value-investing philosophy of buying \"wonderful companies at a fair price.\"\n\nThe key question for investors now is what Berkshire will do with its record $380 billion cash pile as the AI boom sweeps across Wall Street and drives valuations higher.\n\n\"Berkshire is so big now that you have to find bigger opportunities to move the needle,\" Bill Stone, chief investment officer at Glenview Trust, told Yahoo Finance.\n\nIf it doesn't spend that cash, Berkshire could soon face pressure to start issuing a dividend.\n\n\"As a shareholder, the amount of cash they have is excessive,\" Boyar Research president Jonathan Boyar said.\n\n\"Since Buffett is gone, and he's the greatest stock picker of all time, I'd like them to deemphasize the actual stock picking and start paying a dividend,\" he added.\n\nBuffett and his longtime business partner, the late Charlie Munger, were known for a hands-off, decentralized approach that allowed Berkshire's sprawling subsidiaries to operate independently.\n\nThose businesses span industries from railroads and energy to insurance and retail, with holdings ranging from GEICO to See's Candies.\n\nThe conglomerate also has stakes in Apple (AAPL), a top-performing investment and, most recently, tech giant Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL).\n\nAnalysts expect Abel, a 25-year Berkshire veteran with deep experience in the company's energy and industrial operations, to lean into that background as he takes the helm.\n\n\"Under his leadership, it's likely to be an important segment for the company and, I think, investors. Given some of the industrial- and energy-related demands that AI is generating, I think that could be an interesting franchise to watch within the Berkshire framework,\" CFRA Research analyst Cathy Seifert told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAbel may also take a more hands-on approach to managing Berkshire's businesses.\n\n\"There's probably a lot of fat to cut,\" Boyar said. \"There's probably divisions that could be consolidated. There's many things that ... they could do to enhance profitability.\"\n\nGlenview Trust's Bill Stone agrees.\n\n\"Could Munger and Buffett have been very good managers?\" he said. \"They may have, they just decided they don't want to do it. They prefer to spend their time looking for opportunities. There probably is, and I think we've seen it already, some real opportunity to add some professional management and skills ... that I think Greg seems to bring to the table.\"",

Then, he got an even bigger surprise.\n\nSean Klingler of Rigby was recently at a local gas station \"hangout\" having coffee when he decided to check some of the lottery tickets he had stashed in his truck, per a press release and Instagram video from the Idaho Lottery. He quickly found out he had a winner on his hands.\n\n\"I had eight Raffle tickets, and when the clerk checked them, she told me I had won $100,000,” Klingler recalled of his Idaho $1,000,000 Raffle tickets.\n\n“I didn’t believe her. I thought maybe it was $100,\" Klingler recalled of his initial reaction.\n\nThen, the news got even sweeter when the clerk realized that there were some zeros missing.\n\nNever miss a story — \n\n\"She said to me, 'No, I got it wrong — you won $1,000,000!' \" Klingler told the Lottery in the release. \"There was a lot of high-fiving in the store after that.\"\n\n\"It was kind of like a craps table when you're on hot dice,\" he added with a laugh in the Instagram video.\n\nAfter signing his winning ticket, Klingler called his wife and daughter to tell them the exciting news. He said he had to put the call on speaker because they didn't believe him and he needed everyone in the store to confirm the win for him.\n\n\"Yeah, we called [some more] family. Nobody believes you right out of the get-go. They always think you're fooling them. This will help,\" he added in the video, motioning toward his winnings check.\n\nKlingler, his wife and daughter drove to the Lottery's office in Boise on Tuesday, Dec. 30, to claim his prize.\n\nThe man told the Lottery he plans to take \"a responsible approach\" with his winnings. He will pay off a few debts, buy his wife a new car and then put the rest toward his retirement.\n\n“I’ve been playing the Lottery for a long time,” Klingler shared. “You dream about winning, and when it finally comes true, it’s weird.”\n\nOther prizes from this year's Raffle game remain unclaimed, including a second $1,000,0000 ticket sold in Kootenai County and a $100,000 ticket sold in Payette County. Another man, Kurt Blaisdell of Pocatello, won $50,000 in the Raffle and told the Idaho Lottery he planned to use the money to buy his fiancée an engagement ring.",

    "description": "There’s still a great deal to be learned.",
    "fullText": "A scientist in New England came across startling images captured by a trail camera, showing the first documented case of this strange insect behavior in the region.\n\n\"It almost looked like the moose had two [additional] eyes,\" Laurence Clarfeld, an environmental researcher at the University of Vermont, told Scientific American. \"At first, I wasn't sure what it was.\"\n\nClarfeld was describing a scene in which moths could be seen feeding on moose tears. He'd come across the surprising moment while reviewing footage from a camera trap in the Green Mountain National Forest.\n\nThe thirsty bugs weren't indulging in schadenfreude, but in lachryphagy, or \"tear eating,\" a process by which moths and other insects sup on the tears of larger animals — even humans.\n\nAnd yet, it's not the act itself that's remarkable, but where it happened. Lachryphagy has long been assumed to occur almost exclusively in tropical climates. Observing this behavior in Vermont confounds the still-quite-limited scholarly understanding of it.\n\nAccording to Scientific American, there is only one other known and documented case of lachryphagy outside the tropics. That instance took place in Arkansas.\n\nSo what is it about tears that bugs find so enticing? There's no definitive answer yet, but one possible explanation is the unusually high protein content of tears, which is 200 times that of sweat.\n\nOne of the biggest risks of lachryphagy comes from its potential to spread disease. Clarfeld and two co-authors published an article on the footage in Ecosphere in November. They posited that \"eye-visiting moths may be vectors for disease transmission such as keratoconjunctivitis, a condition that may induce eye lesions in moose, with significant health impacts.\"\n\nMoose are already at risk of afflictions like chronic wasting disease, so they hardly need another source of infection. Moreover, the dangers could heighten as rising global temperatures expand the travel ranges of disease vectors.\n\nThere's still a great deal to be learned about lachryphagy, especially now that it has been observed in an entirely new type of climate. For scientists, the chance discovery is a call for further research and awareness.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nIt's also a reminder of why trail cameras are some of the most powerful tools in wildlife research. A well-placed camera can reveal enormously valuable information about the population and status of a species in an area.\n\nAs in this case, cameras can also uncover previously unknown behaviors that could further our understanding of nature.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "China Stopped Production On The World's Largest Particle Accelerator - Here's Why",
    "description": "China's ambitious new particle accelerator was meant to pick up where the Large Hadron Collider left off, but the project was put on pause. Here's the story.",
    "fullText": "Planned to be the largest particle accelerator in the world, China's Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC) was meant to be about 100 kilometers or 62 miles long. That's much bigger than CERN's Large Hadron Collider (LHC) with an approximately 27 kilometer circumference – or nearly 17 miles. These systems, especially the LHC, play a huge role in studying how the universe began during the Big Bang.\n\nDevelopment for CEPC started in 2012, around the time CERN discovered the Higgs boson particle; however, it appears the multibillion-dollar project is now paused. It was not included in the country's next five-year plan, spanning 2026 to 2030, which means it's considered a lower priority by the state — it will see less funding and resources. Wang Yifang from the Institute of High Energy Physics confirmed the change, but although the recent proposal to be included in China's five-year plan was denied, the team plans to resubmit the CEPC proposal in 2030.\n\nWhile it hasn't been directly confirmed, the CEPC would cost an estimated $5.1 billion, money that the country might want to divert elsewhere. In that case, Wang says if the European Future Circular Collider (FCC) – the next-generation collider that would effectively be LHC's successor with a much larger 90.7-kilometer (or 56-mile) circumference – is approved before the 2030 proposals, they'll likely join forces with the related teams instead.\n\nTo summarize, China's CEPC is out, likely due to cost and resource requirements, but the European's FCC still has potential, and the Chinese physicist team may join up if the proposal is approved before the next round of China's plans.\n\nDiscoveries from the systems we have operating now, like the Higgs boson discovery at LHC, occur because of how particle accelerators actually work. They fire particles into a big tunnel, or underground rings, which circle around at incredibly fast speeds before colliding. By observing these collisions, scientists get a glimpse into what the early universe looked like, as well as other foundational elements like quarks, the building blocks of visible matter in the universe. Scientists also used the system to create quark soup, a substance that hadn't been seen for billions of years before that. Generally speaking, when two particles collide, for the infinitesimally small span of time afterwards, scientists can see traces or patterns that are otherwise invisible — that's exactly how they discovered the Higgs boson.\n\nThe larger colliders, like CEPC or FCC, would not only introduce larger tunnel systems but more advanced and unique equipment, to uncover heavier or different particles, many of which the LHC simply cannot create. Imagine what kind of alchemy could be achieved with the larger, more capable collider systems.\n\nAs the current system, the LHC is expected to be phased out by the 2040s; meanwhile, the FCC, if approved, will begin development in the 2030s. That said, construction can't start quite that easily: Before anything happens, the CERN Member States and international partners have to give the upgrade project a greenlight.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "Many people start the new year thinking about ways to improve their health, be more organized and manage their finances.

    "fullText": "Many people start the new year thinking about ways to improve their health, be more organized and manage their finances. Experts say there is one area that touches on each of those resolutions — home care.\n\nEarly and routine home maintenance goes beyond fixing visible damage. It helps ensure a healthy living environment, extends the life of a home and can protect its long-term value, according to real estate professionals. Planning ahead for regular upkeep and for unexpected emergencies can reduce the risk of costly repairs later and help spread expenses more evenly throughout the year.\n\nAccording to research by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency, about three-quarters of existing homes are expected to still be in use in 2050.\n\n“Maintaining the homes that we have is really essential to protecting our health and our well-being,” said Amanda Reddy, executive director of the National Center for Healthy Housing, an organization that researches and advocates for reducing housing-related health disparities.\n\nDespite who owns the property, Reddy says, keeping residences dry, clean, pest-free, well-ventilated and safe is the goal, which can mean different types of maintenance depending on the type of home, where someone lives and the time of year. Here's what experts say about home care and what tasks to put on the checklist this year:\n\nHome care includes the big projects and the everyday decisions\n\nOn average, Americans spend about 90% of their time indoors, 70% of that time inside of a residence, according to the National Human Activity Pattern Survey.\n\n“It's not just that we spend time indoors, but at home. If you are older, very young, have health concerns, or work from home, it is likely more than that,” Reddy said, emphasizing the reason why home care is a valuable investment.\n\nWhat many people think of maintenance includes addressing water and gas leaks, pest infestations, cracks and other major repairs, but home builders say not everything needs a professional and can include actions as simple as wiping counters and sweeping floors of food debris, opening windows for better ventilation or clearing out clogged filters and drains.\n\nResidents should also consider the needs of those living in the home, commonly used spaces such as kitchens, bathrooms and bedrooms, and typically neglected areas like attics and basements. Reddy says “anywhere we’re spending time” or often ignoring and possibly missing necessary repairs should be prioritized.\n\n“At the end of the day, doing any preventative maintenance at all matters more than doing it perfectly or at exactly the right time,” Reddy said. “But timing can make a big difference. A lot of these tasks are seasonal or annual, and you’re not just going to do it one time. Homes are stressed differently by different times of the year, so seasonal maintenance helps us catch problems before they’re made worse by environmental stressors.”\n\nSeasonal maintenance to plan for throughout the year\n\nWhen it comes to maintenance, planning and preparing for anticipated and routine changes in the environment can help mitigate natural wear and tear on the exterior of homes and also create healthy conditions inside — where most people shelter from extreme weather events.\n\n“What happens outside the house rarely stays outside the house. What’s outside gets inside, what’s inside builds up,\" Reddy said, adding that fluctuating outdoor conditions put stress on appliances and systems at different times of the year. “For most people, the seasonal rhythm not only makes sense because of those stressors, it also just is more realistic and effective than trying to tackle a long, overwhelming checklist all at once.\"\n\nFor example, experts say the best time to prepare for cold and wet climate, storms and other natural disasters is to address concerns before temperatures drop. Similarly, it is recommended that residents address systems in homes that work to reduce the effects of extreme high temperatures, dry and drought conditions and associated risks like wildfires and air quality in the offseason.\n\nProfessional guidance from home inspectors, builders and real estate agents says spring and summer tasks should focus on preparing for warmer weather. Experts recommend checking air conditioning systems, cleaning dryer vents to prevent fire hazards, testing sprinkler systems, tending to gardens and plants around homes' exterior and inspecting appliances, electrical equipment and plumbing fixtures. Experts also say spring is a good time to clean and do any house projects that involve painting or remodeling since rain is unlikely to cause delays during that time.\n\nIn the fall and winter months, experts suggest focusing on temperature control and air quality measures as people tend to shelter indoors during incoming colder weather. American Home Inspectors Training guidance says check heating systems, clean air filters, make sure carbon monoxide detectors are working, seal air leaks, prioritize pest control, clean and repair roofs and chimneys, and inspecting drainage options in and around homes.",

    "description": "It may feel safe and comfy, but experts warn it could lead to lasting nerve damage.",
    "fullText": "It’s the same every morning. That tingling creeps into your fingers. And your shoulders? Stiff as always. You stretch out your arms and roll your shoulders until the feeling comes back. You get up, shake it off. Probably nothing, you tell yourself.\n\nJust slept weird, right? Maybe not. The way you sleep might be the real problem.\n\nFinds: This Pillow Literally ‘Cradles’ Your Neck So You Can Sleep Without Pain — And It’s Finally On Sale\n\nMany people don’t even realize it’s happening. They fall asleep with their arms relaxed, but by 3 a.m., they’ve curled in tight. Sleeping with arms bent, curled close to your chest, has been dubbed the “T. rex position” on social media. And while doctors don’t call it that, they do warn that doing it night after night can turn those temporary pins and needles into lasting nerve damage.\n\n“When you sleep with your arms bent and tucked in, you can press on the nerves in your elbows or wrists,” Dr. Raj Dasgupta, a sleep medicine specialist and chief medical adviser for Sleepopolis, told HuffPost. “This can slow blood flow and make your arms feel numb or tingly. If you do it often, it can also strain your shoulders and make them stiff or sore.”\n\nAccording to Dr. Matthew Bennett, a board-certified orthopedic surgeon, some people also develop similar nerve irritation at the wrist, much like what happens with carpal tunnel syndrome. Keeping your elbow bent all night builds pressure where nerves pass through narrow spaces.\n\nTurns out, it’s surprisingly common — and it can steadily get worse over time.\n\nHealth: What We Get Wrong About Death, According To End-Of-Life Workers\n\nKieran Sheridan, a physiotherapist and founder of GulfPhysio, sees complaints regularly in his practice. Patients often describe a “dead arm” feeling or needing to shake out their hands in the morning. “This is your body telling you your nervous system isn’t happy,” he said.\n\nDasgupta also emphasized this. “If your arms or hands go numb every night, stay numb for a while after waking up, or start to feel weak during the day, it’s time to see a doctor.”\n\nWarning signs include shooting pain down your arm, trouble gripping things or even dropping your phone more often. Don’t mistake these for annoying symptoms or clumsiness. It’s your body telling you the damage is getting worse.\n\nBennett said anyone who notices these symptoms becoming more frequent should get checked. “Most cases are manageable and respond well to early, conservative treatment,” he said. Skip treatment, and that’s when trouble starts.\n\n“It’s usually temporary and goes away once you change your sleeping position,” Dasgupta noted. “But if the pressure keeps happening for a long time, weeks or months, it can cause lasting nerve damage.”\n\nCurling up feels comforting. It’s instinctive, like pulling a blanket tighter when you’re cold. However, there’s usually more behind it.\n\nThe body slips into self-protection even when there’s no threat. When the nervous system is on high alert from chronic pain, stress, poor sleep or trauma, Bennett said, “we may subconsciously adopt postures that feel safer and less exposed.”\n\nHealth: This Simple Scandinavian Bed Hack Could Be The Key To Better Sleep\n\nWe automatically search for safety during sleep. And for some people, that search runs deeper than others. Judit Merayo Barredo, a clinical psychologist, said she had a patient who came to therapy experiencing chronic insomnia and persistent fatigue.\n\nEvery night, her patient would wake up tightly curled, arms pressed to her chest, shoulders hunched in that T. rex position. “She often woke with muscle tension, a clenched jaw, and a feeling of emotional heaviness,” Barredo said, “despite sleeping for hours.” It turns out, Barredo’s client was dealing with heavy anxiety and expressing it in her sleep.\n\nThe first goal Barredo set for her patient was calming down her nervous system at night. They tried guided body scans before bed, pre-sleep journaling to get the stress out and also changing her sleep setup. The patient added extra pillows, softened the lights and built a routine she could actually stick to. Barredo said the “shift in her sleep position was one of the first signs that her body was learning to feel safe again.”\n\nOf course, not everyone sleeping in the T. rex position suffers from chronic anxiety. Everyday stress, trauma, poor sleep and regular tension can trigger the same response.\n\nHealth: This Extremely Common Social Habit May Actually Be A Sign Of ADHD\n\nThe problem is willpower doesn’t work during sleep. You can’t tell yourself to stop curling up in the middle of the night. So the aim is to make it physically harder to curl up using barriers and supports.\n\nBennett recommended something surprisingly simple: wrap a hand towel around your elbow and secure it loosely with an elastic bandage. This creates a soft barrier that makes deep bending uncomfortable without waking you up. If you have wrist pain, a wrist brace at night also helps.\n\nFor side sleepers, Sheridan suggests a couple of approaches:\n\nPlace a small pillow or folded towel between your arms and chest to prevent that full curl.\n\nHug a body pillow to keep your arms neutral while giving you something to hold.\n\nIf you sleep on your back, rest your arms by your side or on a pillow near the hips. Your arms should stay straight or just slightly bent. Don’t tuck them under your body or pillow.\n\nHealth: The Time It Takes To Fall Asleep Can Reveal A Lot About Your Health\n\n“Keeping the arms open allows for better circulation, less nerve compression, and faster muscle recovery,” Sheridan explained.\n\nSince this position often reflects a nervous system on high alert, Bennett suggested calming techniques before bed, like breath work or gentle stretching. “The goal isn’t rigid posture correction,” he said. “It’s offering the body more supportive options for rest and recovery.”\n\nIf you wake up with numb hands, stiff shoulders, or pins and needles in your arm, you don’t need a total sleep overhaul, just a few small tweaks. Tonight’s the night to make a change. The T. rex couldn’t change its position ― but you can.\n\n'Orthosomnia' Might Be Ruining Your Sleep.

While conditions improve for most areas on Monday, hazardous winter weather will linger into Tuesday near Lake Iliamna and the Western Alaska Range,\" the NWS revealed.\n\nA high wind warning is in effect for parts of Alaska starting from Sunday morning through Monday as the state braces for winds up to 115 mph. A high wind warning is issued when an area is hit with sustained winds over 60 mph.\n\n\"Take Action! Sustained, strong winds with even stronger gusts are happening. Seek shelter. If you are driving, keep both hands on the wheels and slow down,\" the NWS said.\n\nWhile parts of the state brace for extremely dangerous winds, other parts of the state will start to receive heavy snowfall on Sunday afternoon. \"Heavy snow expected. Total snow accumulations between 12 and 24 inches, with localized amounts up to 30 inches from Port Alsworth to Iliamna. Winds gusting as high as 40 mph. Visibility reduced to one half mile or less at times,\" the NWS revealed.\n\n\"Snow will develop by Sunday afternoon and continue through Monday before tapering off to snow showers by Monday evening. Areas of stronger winds, especially around Lake Iliamna, may produce blowing snow that could significantly reduce visibility.\"\n\nIn the event of a strong wind event, the National Weather Service warned residents to stay inside.\n\n\"Immediately go inside a sturdy building during a high wind warning or severe thunderstorm warning and move to an interior room or basement,\" it said. \"If you are in a mobile home, move to a sturdy building before the winds pick up or the storm system reaches your location.\"",

    "title": "LG's 'Aerominum' Gram Pro laptops feel impossibly light and strong",
    "description": "LG has finally fixed its flex issues thanks to the Gram Pro's Aerominum case.",
    "fullText": "For years, LG has pushed its ultra-light Gram laptops as a way to stand out from the PC crowd, for better or worse. I was't a big fan of the flex-prone case in the 2017 Gram, and we had similar concerns with the first 17-inch Gram in 2019. But in fairness, it's been a while since we've reviewed one, and we found a lot to like in our preview of last year's AI-equipped model. Now LG is back with a major Gram Pro redesign at CES 2026, which features a new aluminum/magnesium alloy it's dubbed \"Aerominum.\" And finally, it seems LG has found a balance between building a super-light notebook (the 16-inch Gram Pro weighs just 2.6 pounds), and crafting something that actually feels durable.\n\nAdmittedly, the Gram Pro doesn't look particularly impressive at first glance. It has a large 16-inch 2.8K OLED screen, which certainly looks nice, but doesn't really stand out from the glut of other OLED laptops on market. It's also powered by Intel's new Panther Lake chips, and it supports dual NVMe SSDs. The magic happens when you pick it up: My brain had a hard time computing how such a large computer felt so light in my hands. And best of all, it didn't flex much when I tried to squeeze the case.\n\nThere's still a bit of give, to be clear, but it didn't feel as precariously bendy as earlier models. I wouldn't stress too much about throwing it into a messenger bag without additional protection. The more I handled the Gram Pro, the more I wished other PC makers strived for similar weight reduction. The Gram Pro weighs about as much as the 13-inch MacBook Air! That's certainly an impressive feat.\n\nI just wish LG spent as much time refining the Gram Pro's keyboard as its case design. There's barely any key travel, which made for an unresponsive and unsatisfying typing experience. I get it, LG probably doesn't have the available vertical height for much key movement, but there are other ways to make typing feel more dynamic. The Gram Pro's trackpad, meanwhile, is serviceable, but it also didn't feel as smooth and responsive as what we see from Apple's notebooks or Microsoft's Surface Laptop.\n\nIn addition to the 16-inch Gram Pro, LG also debuted a 17-inch model with an Aerominum case, which is notable for being the lightest notebook at that size with an NVIDIA RTX GPU. Specifically, it's toting the RTX 5050, which should be enough to play most games at the laptop's native 2,880 by 1,800 resolution (or 1440p blown up a bit). Given the more powerful hardware, the Gram Pro 17 is heavier than the 16-inch model, but it still comes at a relatively light 3.8 pounds. I didn't get a chance to play any games on the laptop, unfortunately, but overall it looks like a decent option for someone who wants a large screen with a bit of horsepower.",

    "fullText": "It's in our nature to want more: More money. More friends. More muscle. More food. A more luxurious car. And, of course, more gains by way of the stock market.\n\nHow can I tell after a year in which the S&P 500's (^GSPC) total return was 17.88%, bringing the index's three-year total return to 86.11%? Because I am always getting asked by people for stock ideas, especially after years of the market basically moving up and to the right.\n\nAs a rule, I don't give out stock ideas, as that is no longer my career (I was an analyst for a decade). So I come to you at the start of 2026 with a tidy list of stock ideas provided by my contacts.\n\nI caution that I am not endorsing the picks of these money management pros. This is not me saying to dump your life savings into these stocks or even buy a single share.\n\nDo your homework on each one. In doing so, you may find you like other stocks in the industry better.\n\n\"One chip company in the world is fueling the AI revolution, and that's Nvidia. And I think as it plays out, the [earnings] numbers are significantly underestimated. I think 15% to 20% at a minimum [earnings growth] going into 2026. You put that together, and I think we're looking at a $250 stock in a base case to end 2026.\"\n\n\"We love Palantir. From a defense standpoint, they are the leader in AI and data, with Defense Department approval and usage. And then beyond that, corporate adoption and sovereign adoption. So we think the name continues [to go higher]. It's one of those names, you can't justify it from a valuation standpoint. But the narrative is quite compelling. And that can drive stocks for a very long time, like it did Amazon for the first 20 years of Amazon's post-IPO life.\"\n\n\"I think Broadcom is a little misunderstood. We were big buyers of it during COVID actually when it was giving you over a 3% dividend yield. So you know we like dividends. So what I like about it is the VMware side of the business and the programable side. These are very specialized chips. So not competing as much with Nvidia, and I think they're creating their own market. And I think their growth rate and the ownership has been tremendous.\n\n\"We've been trimming this position because it grew to so much in our accounts. I mean, we had up to 7% of our portfolio in Broadcom. We didn't want that much. We still like it, but we're not expecting the 5,060% return. We'd be very happy with Broadcom [returning] about 10%.\"",

    "fullText": "Ethereum co-founder Vitalik Buterin declared that the network has finally cracked blockchain’s fundamental trilemma through the combination of zero-knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machines and PeerDAS technology now running on mainnet.\n\nThe breakthrough marks the culmination of a decade-long technical journey that began with Buterin’s first data availability sampling commit in 2015 and early ZKEVM development around 2020.\n\n“These are not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally new and more powerful kind of decentralized network,” Buterin wrote in a post on X, describing how the protocol now delivers decentralization, consensus, and high bandwidth simultaneously, a feat previously considered impossible.\n\nButerin explained that early peer-to-peer networks faced stark limitations, with BitTorrent offering massive bandwidth and decentralization but no consensus mechanism.\n\nAt the same time, Bitcoin achieved decentralization and consensus at the cost of extremely low throughput due to replicated rather than distributed work.\n\nEthereum’s new architecture breaks this pattern by splitting computational work across nodes while maintaining cryptographic verification of all state transitions.\n\nZKEVMs have achieved production-quality performance, with proving times dropping from 16 minutes to 16 seconds and costs falling 45-fold, with 99% of Ethereum blocks now provable in under 10 seconds on target hardware.\n\nMeanwhile, PeerDAS enables nodes to verify data availability by sampling small portions rather than downloading entire blocks, dramatically expanding throughput without sacrificing decentralization.\n\nThe Ethereum Foundation set a security-first roadmap requiring teams to achieve 128-bit provable security by the end of 2026, with intermediate milestones at 100-bit security by May 2026 and mandatory integration with the soundcalc security estimation tool by February.\n\n“If an attacker can forge a proof, they can forge anything: mint tokens from nothing, rewrite state, steal funds,” the foundation warned in December, emphasizing that performance gains cannot compromise cryptographic integrity.\n\nGeorge Kadianakis from the foundation’s cryptography team stressed the importance of securing architectures before they become moving targets.\n\n“Once teams have hit these targets and zkVM architectures stabilize, the formal verification work we’ve been investing in can reach its full potential,” he wrote, noting that recent advances in compact polynomial commitment schemes like WHIR and techniques such as JaggedPCS now make ambitious security targets achievable.",
