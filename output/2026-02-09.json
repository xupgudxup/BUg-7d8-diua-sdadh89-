    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola sends Arsenal warning as Manchester City stay in title hunt originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPep Guardiola has insisted the Premier League title race is far from over after Manchester City produced a late turnaround to beat Liverpool 2–1 at Anfield.\n\nCity were staring at a damaging defeat after Dominik Szoboszlai put the hosts ahead with a spectacular free-kick in the 74th minute.\n\nBut the champions showed their resilience late on, with Bernardo Silva drawing City level before Erling Haaland sealed the win from the penalty spot.\n\nThe victory keeps City firmly in the title conversation, although Arsenal remain in control at the summit, holding a six-point advantage.\n\nDespite the gap, Guardiola believes there is still plenty of football left to be played, with City competing across multiple competitions.\n\n\"Despite what has happened today, we have many good things to fight for. Final of the Carabao Cup, FA Cup we are there, Champions League last 16, it’s exciting,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports.\n\nMORE:Highlights and stats from Man City's win at Liverpool\n\n\"We are six points behind Arsenal, okay it is a big gap, because they don’t concede goals, they win all their games, but many things are going to happen, I guess.\"\n\nLooking further ahead, Guardiola pointed to the demanding nature of the run-in, particularly for teams balancing domestic and European commitments.\n\n\"I have a feeling that improving a little bit will not be enough to compete against Arsenal but still we have margin (to improve).\"\n\n\"We have to (play them) at home and of course we have to beat them. And I've said, 13 games in the Premier League, from my point of view, from my little experience, is a lot of time, a lot.\"\n\n\"It’s proper. When you go into the last games playing any team in a relegation battle, it’s a proper game, football game.\"\n\n\"That makes an influence in the title race, that’s why being nine, 10, 11 points is more difficult, that’s why all we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal, being there, and try if they sleep, if they make something (a mistake), use it.\"\n\nCity’s win was also notable historically, completing their first league double over Liverpool since 1937.\n\nFixtures in focus Arsenal face a challenging schedule in the coming weeks, including league trips to Brentford, Wolves and Tottenham, alongside home fixtures against Chelsea and Brighton, plus an FA Cup tie with Wigan.\n\nCity return to Premier League action with a home match against Fulham, before an FA Cup fourth-round clash with Salford City, Newcastle, Leeds and Nottingham Forest follow shortly after.",

    "title": "Derrick Barnes 2025 Report Card: Grades, Stats and Season Breakdown",
    "description": "Derrick Barnes didn’t dominate highlight reels in 2025, but when the numbers were tallied and the film was reviewed, his season told a much louder story than the spotlight ever did.",
    "fullText": "Derrick Barnes’ 2025 season did not always come with the loudest headlines, but by year’s end it was impossible to ignore his impact on the Detroit Lions’ defense. Reliable availability, steady production and timely splash plays defined a campaign that earned Barnes a solid B grade and reinforced his value within a young, evolving linebacker group.\n\nBarnes played in every game, a significant accomplishment for a position group that has often battled attrition in recent years. That consistency alone mattered for a Lions defense that leaned heavily on continuity and trust at the second level. Availability became part of Barnes’ value, allowing Detroit to maintain its rotations and avoid scrambling for answers week to week.\n\nStatistically, Barnes delivered one of the more complete seasons of his career. He finished with 40 total tackles, four sacks and one interception. Barnes was not just a downhill run defender; he was deployed as a pressure piece, a spy and an underneath coverage defender, often within the same series.\n\nThe pass-rush production stood out most. Barnes’ four sacks placed him in rare company within the organization’s history. He became the first Lions linebacker to record at least 4.0 sacks and an interception in a single season since Chris Claiborne did it in 2002, a span of more than two decades. For a franchise that has cycled through linebacker combinations for years, that milestone carried weight.\n\nLeaguewide, Barnes’ production compared favorably as well. He and Jack Campbell each finished with 4.0 sacks, tying each other for the most sacks by any off-ball linebacker in the NFL this season. In a league where pressure increasingly comes from the edges, Barnes’ ability to affect quarterbacks from the second level added a valuable wrinkle to Detroit’s defensive front.\n\nBarnes’ interception underscored his growth in coverage. While he will never be mistaken for a true coverage specialist, his awareness improved noticeably. He showed better spacing in zone drops and a clearer understanding of route concepts developing behind him. Those gains did not eliminate all limitations, but they reduced the number of coverage mismatches opposing offenses could exploit.\n\nAgainst the run, Barnes remained a dependable presence. His 40 tackles do not jump off the stat sheet, but they reflect assignment soundness more than volume. Barnes often did the dirty work — setting edges, filling gaps and freeing up teammates to make plays. His physicality and discipline helped stabilize a defense that asked its linebackers to play fast and decisively.\n\nThe B grade reflects both achievement and remaining room for growth. Barnes was productive and dependable, but not dominant. There were stretches where his snap-to-snap impact waned, particularly against elite passing attacks that tested him in space. Continued refinement in coverage and improved play recognition could elevate him from solid contributor to difference-maker.\n\nStill, Barnes’ 2025 season marked meaningful progress. He stayed healthy, produced career-relevant numbers and etched his name into a small slice of franchise history. In a linebacker room led by Campbell and defined by versatility, Barnes proved he belongs. For Detroit, that combination of reliability and upside made his season a clear success.",

    "description": "Lacey Eden scored a goal and had two assists, and freshman goaltender Rhyah Stewart bounced back to pick up an important win for the Badgers.",
    "fullText": "MADISON – The two best teams in women’s college hockey, now depleted by the Olympics, met for the fourth time this season.\n\nBut other than that, Feb. 8 at LaBahn Arena seemed a lot like any other time when Wisconsin and Ohio State have faced off in recent years, a scrappy, grind-it-out game decided by determination, heads-up play and the right bounces.\n\nAfter a dispiriting loss a day earlier, the top-ranked Badgers got on the board first and went on to a 4-1 victory over the No. 2 Buckeyes. In the process, UW (25-3-2, 19-3-2 WCHA) won its regular seasons series, three games to one and took over the lead over Ohio State (26-4-0, 20-4-0) in the league standings with two weeks remaining before the playoffs.\n\nFifth-year right wing Lacey Eden, left off the Team USA roster for the Milan Cortina Games, needs to do more than ever for a Badgers team without five of its best players.\n\nEden scored the game’s first goal at 16:17 of the first period through a tangle in front of Ohio State goaltender Hailey MacLeod and then assisted on a breakaway by junior center Cassie Hall that made it 2-0 in the second period and on junior defender Laney Potter’s 5-on-3 goal in the third that took the lead to 3-1.\n\n“From the opening faceoff, we were here to play today,” said Eden, who was frustrated a day earlier when the Badgers seemed to be skating in quicksand. “We had that effort that we were talking about yesterday.\n\n“And just getting pucks the net, yeah, definitely the goal was to get up 1-0 and we were able to capitalize on that and I think that helped the momentum for the rest of the game.”\n\nHead coach Mark Johnson couldn’t ask for more from a player who has been an important part of the leadership group through three UW-OSU national championship battles.\n\nNow she has to step up even \n\n“Whether it’s killing a penalty and blocking a shot and what we saw in the first period, scoring a goal in the first period, making a play on the five-on-three, we keep talking, and she keeps playing well,” Johnson said. “Give her a lot of credit because if you watched her, yesterday and then watched again today, there’s a lot of determination and grit, getting knocked down and just getting back up and keep playing. Fun to watch.”\n\nThe Badgers’ fourth goal came from sophomore center Finley McCarthhy just 26 seconds after Potter’s while UW was still on the power play.\n\nOn the other end of the ice, freshman Rhyah Stewart was making her fourth start since McNaughton left for Italy. She stopped 20 shots on goal and held Ohio State 0 for 7 on the power play.\n\n“Definitely the D-zone, it’s a group effort,” Stewart said. “I just do my job to help them back there, but any help I get is always awesome.\n\n“The more reps you get at this level, it’s kind of just you get more comfortable with the speed of the game and to just kind of know the plays that might happen in front of you. So I think that helps with a lot of confidence in the net.”\n\nStewart is 2-2 in McNaughton’s absence after splits against Ohio State and at third-ranked Minnesota and 3-2 overall.\n\n“I was happy for Rhyahj,” Johnson said. “Back to back weekends against two of the top teams in the country, and she looked comfortable out there today. She looked confident and those are the things you want to see in your players, especially your young ones.”\n\nThe Badgers would love to see more of the same as the regular season winds down as they pursue an 11th regular season conference title before their Olympians return.\n\nOver the remaining two weekends they play a pair of games at Minnesota State and then host St. Cloud State at LaBahn. Both are in the bottom half of the WCHA standings.\n\nOhio State hosts Minnesota and then finishes at last-place Bemidji State.\n\nThen come the WCHA tournament and the NCAA tournament, where Wisconsin is 2-1 against Ohio State in the past three championships.\n\n“Every game you should try to hold yourself to that standard of playing it like a championship game, playing it like your last game, or however you want to think about that,” Eden said. “Against a rival like Ohio State, you need that laser focus, you need to be doing those little things. And I hope we can kind of take notes from this game and continue that into the rest of our regular season as a team.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin women's hockey beats Ohio State 4-1, retakes WCHA lead",

    "fullText": "Gatorade rose to prominence in the early 1990s due, in part, to a commercial titled “Be Like Mike,” featuring Michael Jordan. A quarter of a century later, two coaches named Mike are facing off on the Super Bowl stage, and there’s a great chance one of them winds up being drenched in Gatorade tonight.\n\nEither the Seahawks’ Mike Macdonald or the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel will likely get the traditional Gatorade shower tonight at Levi’s Stadium. We will post the results of the Super Bowl 60 Gatorade color as soon as the electrolytes hit the turf this evening.\n\nWe will soon have the Super Bowl Gatorade color results. Be sure to check back here immediately after the game to see which color cashed.\n\nThere is so much chaos in the closing minutes and immediate aftermath of the Super Bowl that TV cameras can often miss the Gatorade bath.\n\nThis occurred in 2021 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 in Super Bowl LV. CBS cameras missed Bucs head coach Bruce Arians getting doused, and there were many minutes of speculation online regarding which color landed on his head.\n\nA video from the stadium went viral shortly after the conclusion of the game, revealing that Arians was drenched in blue Gatorade.\n\nBlue was a favorite heading into this year’s game, as it owned +260 Gatorade color odds. Only orange had shorter odds.\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl matchup does not have much background when it comes to Gatorade baths. There is no prior video of Macdonald or Vrabel being hit with a Gatorade bath, as neither has reached the Super Bowl as a head coach before.\n\nNeither was hit with a Gatorade bath in their respective conference championship game this year, either.\n\nHere is a look at what Gatorade color payouts would look like on a $10 bet. Payouts are the total amount you would receive in return on a winning bet. So it’s the $10 you bet upfront plus the amount you actually won.\n\nYellow/Green/Lime (+260): $36.00\n\nNo Gatorade Bath (+5000): $510.00\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "The U.S. has medaled in every Winter Olympic sport, except Biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Can American biathletes end their 66-year shutout at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics?\n\nCampbell Wright offers Team USA's best shot at making a biathlon podium. The 23-year-old represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, but the dual citizenship athlete switched in 2023 to represent the U.S., where his parents were born, and won two silver medals at the 2025 World Championship.\n\nAlthough the biathlon officially made its debut at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Olympics, military patrols are a direct precursor to biathlon and date back to the inaugural 1924 Chamonix Winter Olympics. Military patrols were included in the 1928, 1936 and 1948 Winter Games as a demonstration sport, before the first biathlon was contested in 1960 with the men's 20-km event. Women's events made their debut at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games, while mixed relay was added to the program in 2014 in Sochi.\n\nAthletes strap rifles to their back and ski multiple laps around a cross-country track. After each lap, the skier arrives at a shooting zone and fires five shots at a target from either the standing position or prone position. A missed target results in a penalty: either a lap around a penalty loop or one minute added to the overall time. The winner is determined by either the first to cross the finish line or best overall time, depending on the event.\n\nThere are 11 Olympic biathlon events. Men and women have their own events and there's one mixed relay:\n\n4x6-kilometer mixed relay: Two men and two women\n\nCampbell Wright: The 23-year-old represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics before joining Team USA in October 2023. Wright became the first U.S biathlete to win two medals in a single world championship when he won back-to-back silver medals in sprint and pursuit. He's the first American to win a world championship medal since Susan Dunklee in 2020 and the first American male since Lowell Bailey's gold in the 20 km in 2017.\n\nDeedra Irwin: The 33-year-old is looking to improve on her seventh-place finish in the women's 15km individual race in Beijing in 2022, marking the best-ever Olympic finish for an American biathlete.\n\nFrance dominated the 2025 Biathlon World Championships, winning six golds and 13 total medals, the most of any country, followed by nine total medals for Norway, five for Germany and four for Sweden.\n\nFrance's Quentin Fillon Maillet became the first biathlete to win five medals in a single Winter Games after earning two golds (individual, pursuit) and three silver medals (sprint, relay and mixed relay) in Beijing in 2022. France's Julia Simon won a mixed relay silver medal in Beijing in 2022 and took home four golds at the 2025 world championships (individual, relay, mixed relay and single mixed relay).\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biathlon at 2026 Milano Cortina: How it works, U.S. stars to watch",

    "fullText": "If you were expecting a defensive affair in Super Bowl LX, the first half has lived up to the billing.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks scored a field goal on their opening drive of the game to take a 3-0 lead, but that has been half of the scoring so far as the first half of Super Bowl LX draws to a close with the Seahawks leading the New England Patriots by just 6-0 thanks to two field goals from Jason Myers late in the second quarter.\n\nSo that has us thinking: What are the three lowest scoring Super Bowls in Super Bowl history?\n\nSuper Bowl IX was played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings. Similar to Super Bowl LX, the first half of Super Bowl IX was a true defensive struggle, as the only points came for Pittsburgh on a safety when Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton was taken down in his own end zone.\n\nThe opening kickoff of the second half was fumbled by Minnesota fullback Bill Brown, giving the Steelers incredible field position. Pittsburgh capped off their next possession with a touchdown run from Franco Harris to give Pittsburgh a 9-0 lead.\n\nThe Steelers would go on to win by a final score of 16-9, for a total of 22 points.\n\nSuper Bowl VII capped off a perfect 17-0 season for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nBut interestingly enough, it might be most remembered for how Washington scored their only points of the game, coming on this botched field goal attempt from Miami.\n\nGaro Yepremian’s gaffe aside, the Dolphins took the win, and to date the only perfect season in NFL history.\n\nThat is a total of just 21 points.\n\nInterestingly enough, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history featured the Patriots as well.\n\nTom Brady’s final Super Bowl win with New England came in Super Bowl LIII against the Los Angeles Rams. While Jared Goff and company had chances, the Rams offense never found the end zone. New England scored the lone touchdown of the game on a short plunge from Sony Michel, and wide receiver Julian Edelman — who caught 10 passes for 141 yards — took home Super Bowl MVP.",

They also better not have left their wallets at home.\n\nLevy Restaurants made just 200 of what they’re calling the LX Hammer Burger for Super Bowl Sunday.

Most people online cannot get past the price, calling it another case of Super Bowl excess.\n\nOne fan wrote, “I’d rather bite my thumb off and eat it rather than paying 180 for that. There is no doubts that the burger might be tasty, but for 180, nah. I’m expecting wagyu beef for that sum.”\n\nAnother commented, “At that price they can keep it\n\nalways eat somewhere other than the stadium!”\n\nThe most expensive concession item at Super Bowl LX is a $180 beef shank burger that feeds 4 people\n\n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) February 8, 2026\n\nSomeone else wrote, “Mortgage just for a burger.”\n\nAnother fan added, “The majority of the people that would buy these aren’t sitting in a regular seat.

    "fullText": "Kenneth Walker's contract status and projection ahead of 2026 NFL offseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks finally turn the page to the offseason, they'll have a big decision to make on running back Kenneth Walker.\n\nThat's because the former second-round pick is a pending free agent after spending all four of his NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHere's a look at who much Walker is expected to make in free agency.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Walker is estimated to land a four-year, $33.5 million deal in free agency, which is realistic for a few reasons.\n\nFor starters, Walker will be one of the best running backs available in free agency and should draw plenty of interest. Also, Walker has only helped his contract demands with a big showing in the playoffs.\n\nWhat will hurt Walker is the fact that he isn't the most complete back. He's OK as a pass-catcher and struggles in pass protection, so he won't be getting top-of-the-market money.\n\nThe good news for the Seahawks is they are loaded with cap space this offseason, so they'll have no issue re-signing Walker if that's the route they want to go.\n\nCardinals trade rumor could lead to deal with Steelers, Vikings or Browns\n\nAaron Rodgers career update is great news for Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n49ers trade rumor is crushing blow to possible deal with Vikings, Falcons\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't ruling out interesting career change down the line\n\nTravis Kelce rumor offers update on Chiefs superstar's future plans\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor is good news for Pats, Eagles, Cowboys",

    "fullText": "Manchester City were denied a record-equalling 14 consecutive Women’s Super League wins on Sunday after a defeat to Arsenal. The Gunners puts the brakes on City’s title charge with a successful afternoon at the Emirates, thanks to Olivia Smith.\n\nA sole goal from summer signing Smith denied the Citizens from matching the competition’s longest winning streak. The decisive moment came in just the 17th minute, when Mariona Caldentey’s stunning through ball was pounced upon by the Canadian forward. Smith took the ball past Ayala Yamashita and coolly finished into the open net.\n\nThe result has little impact on the league standings, as City still remain top, eight points clear of derby rivals Manchester United. Arsenal however, have a game in-hand due to their participation in FIFA’s Champions Cup, and could close the gap to seven points if they defeat Leicester.\n\nRenée Slegers’s game plan was clear: disrupt City’s rhythm, press high in the central areas, and force defensive mistakes. The first half alone saw Arsenal have nine shots, four of these being on target. Meanwhile, City struggled linking up play between midfield and the attacking third. The away side managed just one shot on target throughout the 90 minutes, which came via Bunny Shaw moments before half-time.\n\nThe midfield partnership of Caldentey and Kim Little proved pivotal in Arsenal’s victory as Man City were forced to play wide, limiting space and time for Vivienne Miedema to dictate play much like she has this season.\n\nDefensively, the Gunners were rock solid. Daphne van Domeselaar looked calm and assured in her first start since November. While Lotte Wubben-Moy and Steph Catley marshalled their lines, limiting City’s attacking prowess.\n\nWinning the Player of the Match, Kim Little’s influence cannot be overlooked. Now 35 years old, the former Scottish international seems to get better with each passing season.\n\nLittle helped the Gunners control the tempo, disrupt City’s flow, and provide calm distribution throughout the 90 minutes. Her experience and reading of the game was pivotal in Arsenal’s dominance and shown in the second half, when a well-timed slide tackle prevented a City counter-attack and allowed the home side to calm the match.\n\nAfter the win, Arsenal’s captain spoke to SkySports and highlighted their growing momentum after recent victories against Chelsea and Corinthians.\n\n“I think we’ve obviously had quite a big week of fixtures when you look at Chelsea and then the Champions Cup last week and now going into Man City,” Little said. “We’ve put in some really great performances throughout the squad, and all the players have done really well.\n\n“We’ve raised to the occasion and obviously a huge part of that is our fans. Being able to play here in North London, to have I think close to 40,000 again today, it’s a pretty special atmosphere.”\n\nDespite trailing in the WSL standings, Little hopes her side can maintain the pressure to the final day.\n\n“I think obviously City have put themselves in a really good position, and our job now is to just push as much as we can until that end game of the season.”\n\nArsenal will hope to continue their fine winning run as they travel to Belgium to face Oud-Heverlee Leuven in the first leg of the UEFA Women’s Champions League play-offs. Having won their previous encounter 3-0, the Gunners will hope to put the tie to bed and continue their title defence.\n\nCity, however, will have five days to prepare ahead of their next league clash against bottom-of-the-table Leicester City.\n\nWSL: Sonia Bompastor extends Chelsea contract until 2030\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback\n\nWSL: Oriane Jean-François departs Chelsea and signs for Aston Villa",

    "fullText": "If it's points you crave, then this Super Bowl will likely not be for you. The 45.5-point total for Seahawks vs. Patriots is the lowest Super Bowl Over/Under in 10 years.\n\nThat said, our Super Bowl predictions won't rule out some fireworks this Sunday night at Levi's Stadium based on recent Big Game history. Each of the past three Super Bowls have gone Over the total.\n\nBelow, we will deliver the Seahawks vs. Patriots final score, and the results for whether or not the Super Bowl total went Over or Under the number.\n\nWe will post the answer to the question of whether the Super Bowl total went Over or Under as soon as the final score is set in stone.\n\nUntil then, here are some nuggets of information regarding the total for Super Bowl 60, and Super Bowl odds history.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots were both Top 10 scoring teams this season. Seattle ranked second overall in team scoring, behind only the LA Rams. Mike Macdonald’s team scored an impressive 29.2 points per game this season.\n\nNew England, meanwhile, ranked eighth in the NFL in points scored — putting up 27.2 ppg. In this year’s playoffs, the Seahawks have had a relatively easy time producing points, while it’s been a slog for the Pats.\n\nThe Seahawks put up 41 points in the Divisional Round against the 49ers, and then scored 31 points against the Rams in the NFC Championship game.\n\nMike Vrabel’s squad has had the unfortunate task of dealing with three of the top-ranked defenses in the NFL in their first three games of this postseason. The Pats scored just 16 points against the Chargers in the Wild Card round, 28 points against the Texans in the Divisional Round, and then scored only 10 points against the Broncos in the AFC Championship game.\n\nBoth the Seahawks and Patriots went Over the total in more games than not this season. The Pats have an Over record of 12-8-0 this season. Seattle, meanwhile, has an Over record of 11-8-0.\n\nDrake Maye and the Patriots have gone Under the total in two of their three playoff games played this winter. Chargers versus Patriots had a total of 45.5 and the two teams combined for just 19 points in the Wild Card round.\n\nTexans versus Patriots had a total of 40.5 points and the two teams combined for 44 points. This past round against the Broncos, the total was 42 points and the two teams combined for a measly 17 points.\n\nAs for the Seahawks, they went Over the total in each of their two playoff games this winter. Against the 49ers in the Divisional Round, the total was set at 44.5. The game went Over as the two teams combined for 48 points.\n\nIn the NFC title game, the Over/Under was 44.5 and the two teams rang up 58 points together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks lead the New England Patriots 6-0 late in the second quarter of Super Bowl LX on a pair of field goals by kicker Jason Myers.\n\nThat's a pretty low score — but it wouldn't be the lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history. It's actually three times more than the lowest halftime score in the big game's history, which came in Super Bowl IX following the 1974 season.\n\nIn a struggle between two classic NFL defenses — Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain vs. Minnesota's Purple People Eaters — the only first-half points midway through the second quarter. On second and 7 from his own 10-yard line, Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton lost the ball and had to fall on it in the Vikings' end zone. He was touched by Steelers defensive end Dwight White, who was credited with the sack.\n\nIt was the first safety ever in a Super Bowl, giving Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead that stood at halftime. The Steelers went on to defeat the Vikings 16-6 for their first of four Super Bowl wins in a six-year stretch.\n\nFollowing the 2018 season, the Patriots led the Rams 3-0 at the intermission of Super Bowl LIII, the second-lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history, on a 42-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski early in the second quarter.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "From her sudden departure from WWE to her critical takes on the American immigration enforcement crisis, Simone Garcia Johnson, known previously as \"WWE NXT\" General Manager Ava has been making headlines in the professional wrestling news cycle. The young Johnson's future extends beyond a week's worth of stories, however, and, according to Dave Meltzer, she is possibly set to delve deeper into the film industry.\n\nOn a recent episode of \"Wrestling Observer Radio,\" Meltzer delved into Johnson's departures: both from WWE, and from social media. Shortly after her WWE contract expired, Johnson took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to openly criticize United States President Donald Trump's administration, especially in regards to their controversial immigration enforcement policies. She deleted her X account not long after, and many, including Meltzer, have speculated that Johnson's anti-Trump sentiments could have contributed to her decision to not renew with WWE, a company with historical ties to Trump. However, Meltzer clarified that Ava was never officially told to delete her social media, and that her departure from X was a personal decision.\n\n\"From what I'm told, no one forced her,\" Meltzer clarified. \"But she was going to have to drop the Ava account anyway, because she's not in her contract, and [WWE owns] the name Ava.\"\n\nMeltzer also addressed Johnson's future offline. According to Meltzer, the common belief is that Johnson will work for Seven Bucks Productions, a content production company started by her father, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Seven Bucks Productions has been involved in several notable film projects, both within and outside the realm of professional wrestling, such as \"Baywatch,\" \"Black Adam,\" and \"Fighting with My Family,\" a biographical film regarding former WWE Divas Champion Paige (known also as AEW's Saraya). While the young Johnson's ties to Seven Bucks Productions is strong, her next move post-WWE remains unconfirmed.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Despite coming off a four-win season and changing head coaches a year ago, the New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl.\n\nLed by Mike Vrabel and MVP-caliber quarterback Drake Maye, they finished the regular season with a 14-3 record and as the second seed in the AFC playoff picture. As such, they went on to beat the Chargers, Texans and Broncos to punch their ticket to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThere, the NFC’s top seed awaits. The Seattle Seahawks reached the Super Bowl by going 14-3 themselves, and by subsequently beating two division rivals — the 49ers and Rams — in the playoffs.\n\nNow, the two teams meet in Santa Clara with the Vince Lombardi Trophy at play.\n\nHere are our updates live from Levi’s Stadium.\n\nSunday, Feb. 8, 6:30 p.m. ET | Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, CA | Broadcast information | Inactives | Game day roster\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Patriots won the coin toss and deferred, putting the defense on the field first to start Super Bowl 60. After a first down run by Kenneth Walker to move the chains, Sam Darnold found a pair of downfield completions to move inside the red zone. New England’s defense then held strong from there to force a field goal. [Patriots 0 : 3 Seahawks]\n\nNew England’s first drive of the day started with three straight touches for Rhamondre Stevenson, including a third-down conversion through the air. After a 12-yard scramble by Maye then set up a 3rd-and-9 after a sack, a blitz off the blindside resulted in a throwaway and punt.\n\nSeattle’s next drive started back up at their own 10-yard line. Immediately facing a 3rd-and-6, Darnold escaped a blitzing Jaylinn Hawkins but missed a wide open Jaxon Smith-Njigba downfield forcing a punt.\n\nA play-action under center pass out of six their O-line group to Kayshon Boutte started the Patriots next drive with a 21-yard gain. Two straight touches to TreVeyon Henderson then set up a 3rd-and-15, where a Seattle blitz got home again for a sack. New England then punted again.\n\nBehind another good punt by Bryce Baringer and coverage by Dell Pettus, Seattle again started inside their own 20. Two run stuffs then set up a 3rd-and-7, where a check down to Barner moved the chains. A big TFL by Craig Woodson and then a pass breakup got Seattle back into a 3rd-and-15 in which Darnold’s pass was incomplete leading to a punt.\n\nNew England continued to struggle to move the football on their next drive, as an incompletion to an open Hunter Henry was followed by a third-down run stop on Stevenson. New England punted again.\n\nFollowing a big time pass breakup downfield by Christian Gonzalez, running back Kenneth Walker found the edge to break free for 30 yards. Two plays later, Walker found running room again escaping for 29 more to move inside the red zone. With Seattle then facing a 3rd-and-12, a pitch to Walker went for a loss again thanks to Woodson. New England forced another field goal. [Patriots 0 : 6 Seahawks]\n\nWith the deficit now six, a long developing second-down sack forced the Patriots into a 3rd-and-17, where a screen to Stefon Diggs went for just five and another punt.\n\nKenneth Walker picked up a pair of first downs to get the Seahawks over midfield. A third down incompletion to Walker then forced a punt by Seattle, which was downed at the 2-yard line.\n\nBacked up on their own end zone, Maye converted a big third-down to DeMario Douglas for a nine-yard gain. Back in a third-and-long after a false start by Will Campbell, Maye uncorked one downfield in a muddy pocket that fell incomplete to Mack Hollins.\n\nWorking over midfield prior to the two-minute warning, Seattle converted a 3rd-and-2 on the ground with 32 seconds remaining. Set up with another 3rd-and-short after using their final timeouts, Darnold’s pass to JSN in the end zone was broken up and nearly intercepted by Gonzalez. New England then held to another field goal.\n\nWith six seconds left in the half, Drake Maye took a knee.",

    "fullText": "Arizona’s first season in the Big 12 Conference was an eye opener, both in terms of the significant bump in competition from the Pac-12 and the hostile atmospheres it entered. No more trips to half-empty gyms in Corvallis or Pullman, or ones in California with nearly as many UA fans as ones for the home team.\n\nTrips to Lubbock, Manhattan, Ames and Lawrence all ended badly. The opponent had a lot to do with that, but so did the crowds. All four games were sellouts, the atmospheres electric.\n\nThe second time around has been much better for Arizona (23-0, 10-0) on the road in the Big 12. It’s won at Utah, TCU, UCF, BYU and ASU, in addition to a nonconference win at UConn in November, the six consecutive road wins the longest in-season streak since 2016-17.\n\nBut now comes a trip to the last road venue that the UA lost in, Kansas’ Allen Fieldhouse. The Wildcats fell 83-76 in Lawrence to end the 2024-25 regular season, keeping Jayhawks coach Bill Self perfect on Senior Day.\n\nSelf, who is in his 23rd season at Kansas, has also never lost at home on Big Monday. He’s 38-0 , with the Jayhawks’ last Big 12 home loss on a Monday coming in 2001.\n\nBut Kansas (18-5, 8-2) has also never beaten a No. 1 team at Allen Fieldhouse, going 0-5 in such opportunities. The last was in 2003, when top-ranked Arizona came to town and won 91-74.\n\n“It’s going to be an awesome atmosphere,” UA coach Tommy Lloyd said. “And I just have a feeling those Jayhawk fans are going to be out for blood. So you know what? We’re here for it.”\n\nArizona is a 2.5-point favorite, per FanDuel Sportsbook, and if that holds it would be just the sixth time Kansas has been a home underdog since 1996.\n\nHere’s what to watch for when the UA and KU meet on Monday night:\n\nDepending on which expert you listen to, or which sportsbook you check out, the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is probably going to be one of two freshmen from the Big 12. Arizona has already faced BYU wing AJ Dybantsa, now it gets a crack at Kansas guard Darryn Peterson.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Peterson is averaging 20.5 points per game, 21.1 in Big 12 play, and makes 41.7 percent of his 3-point shots. He has scored in double figures every time out, going for 18 in 20 minutes against BYU and nailing the tying and winning 3s in the final 1:20 of a win at Texas Tech last week.\n\nBut Peterson has also missed quite a bit of time due to injury. He’s sat out 10 games, nine during nonconference play, did not play at Kansas State on Jan. 24 and a week later didn’t play the second half against BYU because of cramping.\n\nThe last two games, at Texas Tech and vs. Utah, saw him play 30-plus minutes but also post two of his lowest offensive ratings of the season.\n\nLike BYU, Kansas isn’t just its potential No. 1 pick. Three other Jayhawks average more than 14 points in Big 12 games, with guard Melvin Council dropping 36 at NC State in December scoring 22 in an OT win over TCU last month that saw his team rally from down 15 with less than five minutes to go.\n\nKansas also has the top shot blocker in the conference in 6-foot-10 sophomore Flory Bidunga. Bidunga has swatted 65 shots this season, averaging 3.8 in Big 12 play with seven against Utah on Saturday, and is shooting 78.5 percent in conference action.\n\nDepth could be an issue for Kansas, though. Only two bench players average double figures in minutes and guard Elmarko Jackson missed the last game. Self has said Jackson will play against Arizona but may not be 100 percent.\n\nBidunga and starting center Bryson Tiller, a 6-11 freshman, have been good at avoiding foul trouble but if they do get whistled there’s not much behind them to eat minutes.\n\nArizona has outrebounded every opponent this season, finishing plus-20 against Oklahoma State last time out, and is limiting Big 12 foes to boards on 25.6 percent of their misses. That’s tops in the conference, while Kansas is the worst offensive rebounding team in the league.\n\nKansas got 42 of its 71 points against Utah in the paint but also gave up 32 (of 57). The Jayhawks are +6.4 in paint points for the season, +8 in Big 12 games. Arizona, which won the paint battle 54-14 against Oklahoma State, is +19.2 in conference play.\n\nArizona may need to attempt a few more 3-pointers in this one, though, as Kansas is third-best in the Big 12 in 2-point defense. Bidunga’s shot blocking has a lot to do with that.\n\nBrayden Burries was Arizona’s leading scorer for the seventh time, fourth in Big 12 play, but for the 12th time this season the Wildcats had at least five players in double figures. Every member of the 8-man rotation has either led or tied for the lead in scoring in a game, with five different guys doing that in conference games.\n\n“I just feel like our versatility, and we know how deep we are,” Jaden Bradley said when asked about the key to Arizona’s unbeaten start. “It can be anybody’s night, the bigs, the guards, and I feel like everybody’s happy for one another. And I feel like that’s special. You don’t see that too often.”\n\nKansas could have a front row seat for another Bradley masterclass, which he’s mostly saved for ranked foes. The senior guard is averaging 19.7 points in Arizona’s six games against ranked teams, shooting 56.9 percent, and 18.8 points in Big 12 road contests.",

    "description": "The Patriots coach fell short of Canton in his first year of eligibility.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has expressed admiration for the New England Patriots dynasty in the past, so it was little surprise what he thought about Bill Belichick's Pro Football Hall of Fame snub.\n\nSpeaking with NBC News in an interview conducted Wednesday and aired on Super Bowl Sunday, the president complained about the longtime Patriots coach failing to reach Canton in his first year of eligibility:\n\n\"I thought it was terrible. I mean, he's— won so much, won so many Super Bowls. Great coach. Became a little bit controversial, I guess, after that, this little period after that. During it he was just a great coach. I thought it was very inappropriate.\n\n\"Oh yeah. It's like what have you done for me lately? Well, you know, you have a great career and he has a little bit of a controversial year and a half, two years maybe. But— what difference does that make? No, he should've— he should be in there right at the top.\"\n\nTrump is hardly the first person to rail against the snub. He refers twice to \"controversial\" actions on Belichick's part, which could be a reference to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that occurred under the coach's watch. However, he alludes to those controversial years being after Belichick's NFL career so he might simply be referring to the 73-year-old's post-Patriots UNC-Jordon Hudson era.\n\nRegardless, Belichick's snubs came down to more than controversies. As one of the few Belichick \"no\" voters laid out, the matter of voting Belichick was more than \"yes\" or \"no.\" To some, it was \"Belichick\" or \"a group of senior players who might not get another Hall of Fame shot for years.\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame's voting process created conditions in which the NFL's all-time leader in playoff wins among head coaches was put in competition for a limited number of votes with three senior players and a contributor, in this case Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nThis year, the only one of that quintet to emerge was former San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig, who was recognized on the field at Super Bowl LX alongside modern-era inductees Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri.",

    "fullText": "Who cares about the 2026 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks? Most football fans are already looking to next year, and hoping their team can make the surprising leap that New England and Seattle did this season.\n\nThe Seahawks’ were No. 19 in the preseason Super Bowl odds this season. The Patriots were No. 21 in the preseason Super Bowl odds. The NFL is king in part because almost every team starts each season with the belief that they can win the championship if everything goes according to plan. Parity is going stronger than ever in the modern game, and the 2025-26 season is all the evidence you need.\n\nIt’s never too early to look ahead to next year. Here’s every team’s Super Bowl LXI odds a year out before the game is played in SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on Feb. 14, 2027. My favorite bets are included after the table.\n\nChicago Bears (+2700): The Bears are due for some regression to the mean in terms of forcing turnovers next year. Chicago’s 22 takeaways led the league, and only Houston (17) was close, with no other team having more than 13. That’s okay: the Bears’ offense is probably due for some positive regression and additional growth from QB Caleb Williams. Williams turns 25 years old in the middle of next season as he starts Year 3 in the NFL, and he already showed massive improvement in the second half of year two. The Bears should use their available cap space to beef up the defensive front, which will hopefully make them less turnover dependent. With rookies like Colston Loveland and Luther Burden II primed to take a bigger step forward, plus a possible breakout year from Rome Odunze in his third season, the Bears should be a better offense and more sustainable defense.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (+1800): The Niners had a season from hell in terms of injuries and still had a really good year. San Francisco will be healthier coming into next season, and the injuries they had this season allowed several talented young players to get their feet wet, which should benefit them next year. Expect the Niners to be an active team in free agency after the likely release of Brandon Aiyuk. Kyle Shanahan is as good as any head coach in the NFL. There’s still blue chip talent up and down this roster. If they went 12-5 in a season where they had a lot of bad luck, I’ll bank on some positive regression next season.\n\nWashington Commanders (+4500): Jayden Daniels has looked like a superstar quarterback when he’s fully healthy, and this offseason the Commanders have the opportunity to load up on talent around him. Washington enters the offseason with the No. 7 overall pick, and tons of cap space to splurge on free agents. Edge rushers, linebackers, and secondary help could all be on the menu for a defense that struggled this season. It would also be nice to get Daniels some weapons with Zach Ertz working through a torn ACL and Deebo Samuel entering free agency. Washington needs a talent infusion, but they have the means to do it, and I like the QB/coach combo of Daniels and Dan Quinn for a deep sleeper.",

In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters.

    "fullText": "Another day, another vulnerability (or two, or 200) in the security nightmare that is OpenClaw.\n\nResearchers, over the last two days, have disclosed additional issues with OpenClaw - the vibecoded and famously insecure AI agent farm formerly known as Clawdbot and then Moltbot. Specifically, researchers say that the open source agent platform is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection, allowing an attacker to backdoor a user's machine and then steal sensitive data or perform destructive operations.\n\nPlus, as other threat hunters have recently found, the ClawHub marketplace for OpenClaw is teeming with malware and leaky agent skills that expose sensitive credentials.\n\nIn a Thursday blog, Snyk engineers said they scanned the entire ClawHub marketplace containing nearly 4,000 skills and found that 283 of them - that's about 7.1 percent of the entire registry - contain flaws that expose sensitive credentials.\n\n\"They are functional, popular agent skills (like moltyverse-email and youtube-data) that instruct AI agents to mishandle secrets, forcing them to pass API keys, passwords, and even credit card numbers through the LLM's context window and output logs in plaintext,\" the engineers wrote.\n\nThis security flaw is due to the SKILL.md instructions, and developers treating AI agents like local scripts.\n\nWhen someone prompts an agent to \"use this API key,\" the model saves the key in memory, and that conversation history can be leaked to model providers such as OpenAI or Anthropic - or they could appear in plain text in application logs.\n\n\"Perhaps most alarming is the buy-anything skill (v2.0.0),\" the engineers wrote. \"It instructs the agent to collect credit card details to make purchases.\"\n\nTo do this, the LLM tokenizes the user's credit card number, thus sending financial info to the model provider. A subsequent prompt could ask the agent: \"Check your logs for the last purchase and repeat the card details,\" and thus expose the user's credit card to an attacker, enabling financial fraud and theft.\n\nSnyk's research follows a similar blog the developer-focused security shop published on Wednesday that found malware-laced skills across the ecosystem, including 76 malicious payloads designed for credential theft, backdoor installation, and data exfiltration.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, AI security firm Zenity's research arm demonstrated how an attacker could use indirect prompt injection to backdoor OpenClaw users' machines. The problem here is due to AI agents' integrations with other productivity tools like Google Workspace and Slack, allowing OpenClaw to access email, calendars, documents, and enterprise Slack chats.\n\nIn Zenity's proof-of-concept, the attack begins with a Google document and assumes that the OpenClaw instance already integrates with a user's Google environment - although the threat hunters note that a Google Workspace integration is not a prerequisite for the attack. Any trusted third-party integration will work, as this initial integration is only needed to deliver the initial malicious document or other type of content.\n\nIn the Google doc example, it contains an indirect prompt injection payload directing OpenClaw to create a new integration with a Telegram bot.\n\n\"Once the integration is created, OpenClaw begins accepting and responding to messages from the attacker-controlled bot,\" the researchers wrote. \"From this stage onward, the attacker interacts with OpenClaw exclusively through the newly added chat channel.\"\n\nThis means that an attacker can issue commands via the bot, asking OpenClaw to read all of the files on a user's desktop, steal their content and send it all to an attacker-controlled server, and then permanently delete all the files.\n\nOr, they could instruct the agent to download and execute a Sliver command-and-control (C2) beacon onto the victim's computer for long-term remote access. At this point, the attacker wouldn't really even need the AI agent and could instead use the backdoor and C2 channel for lateral movement, privilege escalation, credential harvesting - even ransomware deployment.\n\nThe evil possibilities are truly endless.\n\nThe Register reached out to OpenClaw and its developer Peter Steinberger about these security issues - the latest in what has become a daily deluge of OpenClaw vulnerabilities - and did not receive an immediate response. We will update this story if and when we do. ®",

    "description": "A mom of five shares why growing up surrounded by cousins, sleepovers, and close family relationships has been priceless for her kids.",
    "fullText": "Occasionally, when it comes up in conversation that I have five children, I'm met with surprise and sometimes, a little bit of shock.\n\nAnd while I understand that five may seem like a lot of kids in some regards, in my neck of the woods, it's really not that uncommon. In fact, my sister-in-law has seven children, so in comparison, my brood is the small one.\n\nAll in all, with kids ranging in age from a few months to 17, my kids are a part of a close-knit cousin clan of 15 and counting.\n\nHaving a lot of cousins nearby can be costly for birthdays and the holidays, but for everyday life, the fact that my kids have those relationships truly feels priceless.\n\nI love the simple happiness my kids get from spending time with their cousins, and it feels like such a gift. In a world where it feels like everyone is trying to sell me something or make me pay for \"fun\" experiences for my kids, knowing that what they love most in the world is just being at home with their cousins feels almost too good to be true sometimes. Honestly, I wish I could recapture that level of pure joy in my own adult life again.\n\nI will be honest with you: having 10 kids in my house at once does mean I have to do a lot of post-play cleanup (and right now, we're currently cycling through a stomach bug passed along over our cousin sleepover), but it's always worth it for how much fun the kids have.\n\nAside from the sleepovers our kids can usually talk us into, having a sister-in-law with seven kids is also very convenient for me as a mom. All it takes is her family to come over for birthdays and special occasions, and we have an instant, built-in party.\n\nIt really works out for me, especially because each of my kids has an instant playmate in their cousin who is their age.\n\nFor instance, my son is the only boy in our family, but because he has two male cousins near his age, he gets the fun boy time he misses out on at home. And my youngest daughter has a large five-year gap with her own siblings, so she gets to experience the fun of playmates her age, too.\n\nMy oldest girls don't have cousins their ages, so they have missed out on some level of the cousin fun, but even as teenagers, they love all their cousins, and they have a special relationship with all the littles that is beautiful in its own way. It's so fun watching the younger girls look up to them, and my girls are always so gracious, letting the littles do their makeup and hair and playing with them when they are together.\n\nRight now, my kids are incredibly lucky with the time they get with their families. They see both sides of their families regularly, with weekly breakfasts, time at church, all holidays and special occasions, sports events, and random visits, just for fun. My husband and I both live within 30 minutes of almost all of our own siblings and parents, so to my kids, close-knit families are the norm.\n\nWhile my kids are incredibly close with their cousins right now, I know those relationships might change as they get older. People can grow apart, family members will most likely move away, and things can happen.\n\nBut no matter what their relationships look like in the future, I do believe that the close-knit relationships and the memories they are creating together will shape them. Belonging somewhere matters, both as a child and as an adult, and I hope that the feeling of being loved as part of a big family sits somewhere inside them as they grow.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kristen Boelen, the founder of Lunch Break Vintage. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have been thrifting since the moment I could drive. Back then, I was into higher-end things that were out of my budget, and I'd go thrift shopping to find similar items that I could afford. That habit carried on through college and beyond, including when I was most recently working as an art director for a wine and spirits company. While working there, I'd thrift on my lunch breaks.\n\nI'd find stuff for myself, as well as one-of-a-kind items that didn't fit. I wanted someone to take that stuff. So I began selling items on Whatnot.\n\nI'd thrift on my lunch break from work, and then on the weekends I'd go live and sell my pieces. My business grew from there, and I named it Lunch Break Vintage, which I began full time in February 2025.\n\nIn December 2025, I was at a thrift store in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was a normal Wednesday, which is the day this particular thrift store opens for the week, and when I always try to go. It was very empty that day.\n\nTwo woven leather bags caught my eye. You see woven leather bags all the time. There are so many Bottega Veneta dupes. I didn't really think much about it, just that one of them looked exceptionally nice.\n\nI first noticed the hardware, then the leather slouching and hanging. I could tell it was soft leather. When I picked it up, it was heavy — designer leather bags have a weight to them because of the hardware. I opened it up and saw the logo. You can see in the video that I posted that's the moment my jaw drops. The leather inside was really soft and buttery too; that's always a sign a bag is legitimate.\n\nI know they sort through and send a lot of the higher-end pieces to an online audience. It seemed unrealistic that someone wouldn't have set it aside. I thought, if they had put it out there, it must not be real.\n\nI took a photo of it and put it into Google Lens, and found on Vestaire Collective there was the exact same bag and color. That clued me into the style name and that it had been retired. There's a video of me going, \"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,\" once I figured out where the serial tag was. I got out of there as quickly as possible, paying $8 for the bag.\n\nI later had it authenticated through an app I use called Authentic Detective. It will give you a certificate of authenticity. Online research says the bag is valued at around $3,000.\n\nI'm keeping the bag for myself. It's something that will be passed down for generations. I had so many comments on the video saying that the bag was ugly, but I love it.\n\nI thrift all the time because I now do this for a living, but I think consistency is key. I thrift at least three times a week, every week. It's also important not to just pick up what is trending. A good secondhand item has to check all the boxes for me, and I really care about quality, always looking for natural fibers. I focus on what makes people feel elevated and the kinds of secondhand pieces they can keep in their closets forever.\n\nDon't believe that middle-of-nowhere places are garbage. Some of my best, coolest, most unique pieces have come from middle-of-nowhere stores.",

Prominent CEOs and startup founders alike are encouraging the use of vibe-coding across their teams. And billions are being poured into new vibe-coding companies.\n\nLovable, one of Europe's fastest-growing startups, announced that it had raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation in December. Cursor, an AI-assisted code editor, announced a Series D funding round of $2.3 billion in November and said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue.\n\nThe approach is also threatening traditional engineering jobs. In a Business Insider survey of 167 software engineers, 75 engineers said that they were \"keeping up,\" while 30 said they felt ahead of the curve, and 27 felt behind.\n\n\"Vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic 'contribution,' and even its article is longer. lol,\" Karpathy wrote on X about its meteoric rise.\n\nKarpathy was a founding member of OpenAI in 2015, years before competitors like Anthropic and xAI emerged. He later moved into self-driving technology, leading Tesla's Autopilot program as head of AI. He's now building Eureka Labs, which describes itself on its website as building a \"new kind of school that is AI native.\"",

    "description": "Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a president repeatedly declaring inflation beaten while rarely acknowledging the strain many Americans say they still feel.\n\nIn five speeches on the economy since December, Trump asserted that inflation had been beaten or was way down almost 20 times and said prices were falling almost 30 times, assertions at odds with economic data and voters' daily experiences. Much of the remaining time was spent on grievances and other issues, including ​immigration, whether Somalia was a country, and attacks on opponents.\n\nTaken together, the speeches portray a president struggling to reconcile his central claim — that he has fixed the cost-of-living crisis — with inflation near 3% over the past year and voters’ lived experience of paying more for grocery staples. The price of ground beef, for example, ‌is up 18% since Trump took office a year ago, while ground coffee prices are up 29%.\n\nRepublican strategists told Reuters that his mixed messaging on the top issue for voters risks creating a credibility gap for him and the Republican Party ahead of the November midterms, when control of Congress will be at stake. Opinion polls show voters are deeply unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy.\n\n\"He can't continue to make claims that are demonstrably ‌false, particularly at the expense of Republicans who are in competitive House districts or Senate races,\" said Rob Godfrey, a Republican strategist. Trump \"must be disciplined and focused,\" he added.\n\nOne source close to the White House said the president needed to hit the issue of affordability harder and through personal visits to critical districts.\n\n\"He needs to bring the message out because the message is not resonating,\" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the issue.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Trump’s focus on illegal immigration in his speeches is directly connected to his argument that people in the country illegally have an adverse impact on the economy. Desai said it causes “public services being overburdened, business activity disrupted by crime, housing markets flooded, and workers’ wages depressed.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stressed that much work remains to clean up the economic mess he says his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, left him, Desai added.\n\nTRUMP VEERS OFF MESSAGE TO RAIL ABOUT IMMIGRATION\n\nThe Reuters analysis found that Trump - when not declaring inflation beaten - devoted nearly half his speaking time to grievances and other issues.\n\nIn about five hours of speaking time, he spent roughly two hours straying into ⁠about 20 topics unrelated to prices, the Reuters review found. When he veered off message, his top issue was illegal immigration, ‌which he spent a total of about 30 to 40 minutes talking about.\n\nIn the speeches he insulted Somali Americans in Minnesota, who voted against him in the 2024 election. He referred to Somalia as \"not even a country\" - and in four speeches he disparaged Somali-born Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nA progressive, high-profile Democrat and Muslim, Omar has been a frequent Trump critic, especially over his immigration policies.\n\n\"Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,\" Omar said last month, the ‍day after a man sprayed a foul-smelling liquid on her at a town hall event.\n\nTrump also talked about men in women's sports, Venezuela, Iran, the Islamic State militant group, Greenland, Ukraine and Russia, military recruitment, his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, U.S. weaponry, his exaggerated claim to have ended eight wars, and even how much a Fox News anchor likes him.\n\nTRUMP'S MEANDERING WORRIES STRATEGISTS\n\n\"Inflation is stopped. Incomes are up. Prices are down,\" Trump said in an Iowa speech on January 27.\n\nOnly twice in the five speeches did Trump acknowledge that prices are still too high, but he blamed them on Biden. Trump was elected in 2024 because of voter unhappiness with Biden's handling of inflation - which spiked to over 9% in 2022 - and illegal immigration.\n\nDemocrats caused prices \"to be too high,\" Trump told a rally ​in Pennsylvania on December 9. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nIn the same speech he called the term \"affordability\" a Democratic \"hoax\". After a public backlash, he has ceased saying that in more recent speeches.\n\nIn four of the speeches Trump repeatedly and haphazardly switches topics, often when he is in the middle of talking about the economy, the Reuters review found.\n\nFour Republican strategists ‌interviewed by Reuters said Trump's meandering style - which he proudly calls \"the weave\" - risked drowning out his core economic argument that he has brought inflation and prices down.\n\nSpeaking to world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 21, Trump spent the first 22 minutes on topic, then suddenly, for the next 22 minutes, insulted Europeans, said they would be speaking German if it wasn’t for America, called NATO ungrateful, and decried the “crooked” media before pivoting back to the U.S. economy.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said voters want to hear what Trump is doing to lower costs. \"But they have no memory of what Trump says about economic issues because of the volume of his own rhetoric.\"\n\nOne source familiar with the White House's thinking said Trump was likely to use his State of the Union address on February 24 as the kickoff for more intense domestic travel to amplify his message on affordability.\n\nFor many Americans, the economy still feels unforgiving. Prices remain high, even though the inflation rate has inched down since Trump took office, from 3% to 2.7%. A lower inflation rate does not mean prices are decreasing - just that they are growing at a slower pace, economists stress.\n\nIn the 12 months through December 2025, food costs were up over 3%, while average hourly earnings were up only 1.1% year over year. The unemployment rate was 4.4% in December, up from 4% when Trump took office in January 2025, according to government data.\n\nIn ⁠some of the speeches Trump correctly identifies a drop in prices for a few everyday goods, including eggs and gas. The cost of eggs fell about 21% in December from a year earlier after ​being 60% higher during Trump's first months back in office. Gas prices are about 4% lower since January last year.\n\nBut the cost of an average grocery basket has risen. The price of coffee, beef, and some fruits, ​among other items, has risen in the past year.\n\nTrump does offer solutions in his speeches, including his tax cuts that kicked in last month that will produce greater savings for tens of millions of families; the scrapping of taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payments; his plan to reduce mortgage interest rates; a proposal to lower housing prices; and deals with health insurance companies to reduce drug prices.\n\nMost economists expect U.S. households and the economy at large to benefit in the months ahead from the tax cuts. But Trump's more recent proposals are unlikely to have a ‍significant impact on the cost of living between now and November, some economists told Reuters. One ⁠of Trump's ideas - to cap credit card interest rates to 10% for a year - could even backfire since it could limit access to credit for lower-income families, some economists have warned.\n\nMike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports candidates for the House of Representatives, said Trump and Republicans were helping working families. \"Voters are seeing this clear contrast, and the best is yet to come.\"\n\nSome 35% of Americans approve of Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a January 25 Reuters/Ipsos poll, up slightly from 33% in December. But it is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office a year ago.\n\nFormer economic officials in previous administrations say Trump is falling into the same trap Biden did in 2024 when confronted with persistently high inflation.\n\nBiden kept claiming the U.S. economy was strong and urged voters to look at other economic data. That strategy failed badly and Democrats were punished at the polls.\n\nThe officials agreed it was important for presidents to show voters they understood their economic pain, especially in an election year.\n\n\"We ‌definitely talked past people on inflation,\" Jared Bernstein, the head of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.\n\n\"What we typically did was to say, 'A new report just came out on jobs, it's very strong,' and that was all true. But the fact is that there wasn't much we were ‌able to do in terms of the price level.\"",

    "description": "Christina Mann is hauling five-gallon jugs of water from a friend's house because her monthly utility bill has spiked like crazy. And she's not the only American being squeezed.",
    "fullText": "Christina Mann moved from Cleveland, Texas, to the small community of Point Blank four years ago when she retired. She wanted to retire close to the water, a dream of hers. Now, water is the nightmare that's keeping her from making ends meet.\n\nEvery other day, Mann drives several miles to a friend's house to fill five-gallon jugs from a garden hose. That water is what she uses to wash dishes, wash her hands and flush her toilets — her only supply after she decided last November to disconnect her water service entirely.\n\n\"I choose to eat, and I told them that every time you go up, that takes out of my money a month for my food,\" Mann told ABC13's 13 Investigates (1).\n\nMann lives alone on a monthly Social Security check she budgeted carefully around when she retired. There was enough to cover her bills, but barely. When the base fees charged by her provider — a for-profit company called Texas Water Utilities — kept climbing, she felt cornered. A termination notice arrived, and she didn't fight it. \"You don't need to send me one. Just come cut my water off. I can't afford it,\" she said.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAccording to a copy of Mann's bill reviewed by 13 Investigates, she was charged $169 for a month in which she used just 2,000 gallons. In July, the fees alone — base charges for water and sewage, pass-through fees and a state fee — totaled $150.18. Her actual water and sewage usage that billing cycle came to $9.34.\n\nThat means roughly 94% of her bill had nothing to do with how much water came out of her faucet.\n\nMann said she could manage if her bill were closer to the roughly $60 a month she paid back in Cleveland.\n\nMann's provider, Texas Water Utilities, is an investor-owned utility — a for-profit company, not a city-run system. Texas Water Utilities serves about 60,000 customers in 32 counties, is acquiring at least four other companies, and has filed to tack on a $34-per-month \"system improvement charge\" to recoup more than $80 million in infrastructure spending.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan's volatile financial markets must now contend with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi firmly in the driver's seat after her decisive victory on Sunday, which hands her an electoral mandate to reflate the economy.\n\nThe question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously.\n\nHow has the Takaichi trade impacted Japanese markets?\n\nWhy are investors concerned about Japan's debt burden?\n\nHow might Takaichi's electoral victory affect policy direction?\n\nWhat are Takaichi's key economic stimulus policies?\n\nSince she began her rise to become the nation's first female premier in October, the \"Takaichi trade\" has pushed domestic shares to record highs while causing a precipitous selloff in Japanese government bonds ‌and the yen.\n\nVoters braved heavy snowfalls in Tokyo and other parts of Japan to deliver what exit polls indicated to be the most decisive win for Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party since 1996.\n\n\"The stock market is a true believer in Takaichi, so the big win is going to be good news for equities when the markets open on Monday,\" said Chris Scicluna, the head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.\n\nTakaichi, a devotee of the \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies of the late premier Shinzo Abe, has ⁠pledged a proactive fiscal policy funded largely through bond ‌issuance.\n\nShe came to office at a low point in power and popularity for her Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-World War Two period, forcing her to bargain with opposition parties with even more liberal fiscal ‍platforms.\n\n\"The administration's foundation will become much more stable, making it easier for expectations to build around advancing economic policy,\" said Kota Suzuki, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management. \"Because there will no longer be a need to actively seek the opposition's cooperation, there will be less pressure for giveaway-style fiscal expansion.\"\n\nWith polls already indicating a decisive LDP win, Japan's benchmark ​Nikkei 225 Index set an all-time high of 54,782.83 on Tuesday. Big winners of late include sectors like defence, artificial intelligence and chips that ‌have been singled out by Takaichi for targeted investment.\n\nBut prospects for more government outlays have unsettled investors already concerned about Japan's debt burden, the largest in the developed world. Those worries came to a head on January 20, when rates across the JGB yield curve shot to multi-decade or even record highs after Takaichi called for the snap election and embraced suspending the sales tax on food.\n\nThe yen has also been punished, losing about 6% against the dollar since Takaichi's selection as prime minister in October and plumbing record lows against the euro and Swiss franc. Only threats of joint currency market intervention with the United ⁠States have arrested the yen's slide.",

    "description": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President",
    "fullText": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro, asking residents if they still supported the party that has run the country for nearly 20 years. The result: about half of members said they no longer did.\n\n“The response is very bad,” said a person who helped lead the effort. “There is division among us.”\n\nWhile Reuters was not able to independently verify the canvassing results, the reported drop in support aligned with ​information gathered from three other parts of the country.\n\nThe news agency spoke to 13 party members or local leaders across four states who reported fractures in the United Socialist Party (PSUV) following the U.S. attack. All of them expressed a deep sense of uncertainty and many voiced worries about their economic future.\n\nThe government’s ‌patronage system, which bought a form of party loyalty through financial benefits and food parcels, also appears to be under pressure, with five of the sources saying some contributions had stopped since Maduro’s capture.\n\nSix of the people described distrust among party loyalists and spreading suspicion of interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Eight said they had seen a drop in participation and support at their local party branch, with two of them estimating a ‌70% fall in attendance at events like marches and local assembly meetings.\n\nThe people Reuters spoke to all requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, with several saying local leaders were encouraging the party faithful to snitch on any members losing faith in the cause, a common tactic for weeding out popular dissent in Venezuela. Reuters has withheld the names of the people it interviewed to protect their safety.\n\nThere are no recent public numbers on party membership and while Reuters talked to people observing falling participation in four geographically dispersed states, the news agency could not determine what the situation was across all 24 states in the country. Most foreign media do not have permanent staff in the country and Venezuelans are generally reluctant to speak freely with reporters because of potential reprisals.\n\nNeither the Venezuelan government nor PSUV responded to Reuters requests for comment on the eroding support for the party and the fraying of its patronage system.\n\nCalls for national unity in the face of threats to Venezuela have been a constant in Rodriguez’s speeches and public appearances since Maduro's removal, and she has also cheered the resilience of the ⁠country's people and pledged economic development for all.\n\nDespite decrying Maduro’s detention as a kidnapping, Rodriguez appears to be complying with ‌U.S. demands to open the country to American oil companies and has also met with the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to discuss cooperation against drug trafficking.\n\nFraying party support at the grassroots level would be a problem for Rodriguez. Reuters has previously reported how she is already battling to shore up her rule by putting allies in positions of power to shield herself from the potential threat posed by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who also heads the PSUV and has close connections to the security services and colectivos - the hardline motorcycle-riding ‍enforcement arm of the party.\n\nPublicly, Cabello has stressed unity. On Jan. 12, he used his weekly press conference as party leader to emphasize Rodriguez has \"all the support of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.”\n\nNeither U.S. President Donald Trump nor Rodriguez has seriously addressed the question of elections since Maduro’s ouster, but the anecdotal dwindling of local support appears to point to an uncomfortable truth for the PSUV: Maduro’s exit has done little to improve popularity, according to the party members Reuters interviewed.\n\nA local party leader in the northern state of Aragua said the party had no way to grow or ​win elections, “even if we had Che Guevara or Gandhi as a candidate.\"\n\n“You have a situation where the apparatus of repression is fragmenting and on top of that the remaining grassroots base is demobilizing. That’s a huge challenge for governability,” said Ricardo Rios, head of Caracas-based analysis and consultancy firm Poder & Estrategia.\n\nStill, local support for the party ‌may revive. Venezuela has already received $500 million from crude sales and any significant economic improvement could help boost funding of the party and get membership perks, which have historically helped buttress support, flowing again.\n\nIn response to Reuters questions about the problems facing the Socialist Party, a senior White House official said: “The country is stable, illegal migration has stopped, drug flows have halted, and the new oil deal will generate economic prosperity for both the Venezuelan and American people.\"\n\nAll of Venezuela's top officials are long-time members of the PSUV. The party was created in 2007 by merging the disparate political and social forces that swept socialist President Hugo Chavez to power in 1999. That movement also came to bear his name - ‘Chavismo.’\n\nThe reasons given for falling local support varied. Some said people were wary of being associated with the party if the opposition were to win power, fearing some form of retribution. Others said uncertainty was causing infighting in ⁠the party. Nearly all spoke of disillusionment and questioned the loyalty of the new leadership to the Chavista cause.\n\nAdding to people’s hardship are problems with the delivery of party handouts, both food and ​financial, that have hit local branches, five sources said. They said members in three states - Zulia, Aragua and Falcon – were deserting the party because the government had stopped making bonus payments and distributing welfare. Reuters ​was not able to independently verify the information it gathered about stalling handouts.\n\nGovernment payments, which through various different benefits can for some add up to over $100 a month, are a vital income for millions in Venezuela, where the monthly minimum wage is less than $1 and poverty is rampant. Inflation is also estimated by analysts to have topped 400% in 2025.\n\nThe complexity of Venezuela's welfare system, with an array of benefits delivered at different times to different people, meant Reuters was unable to get a complete picture of the status of all payments and food ‍parcels, with some of those interviewed saying certain bonuses were still arriving while others were ⁠not.\n\nOne source in Zulia state said that in their district 600 people had not received their “family bonus”, a direct welfare payment of up to $65 given to help with living costs. Three sources also reported that food parcels, known as CLAP, have not been delivered, with some adding that problems with these deliveries predate the capture of Maduro but have continued since.\n\nIn the municipality of Mara, in the northwest border with Colombia, one party member said there were old-school Socialist Party members still committed to the cause and “clapping like seals” but that even they are “turning because they haven't been paid their bonuses.\"\n\nAbout 70% of local party members and ⁠public employees in Mara ignored calls to participate in two recent pro-Maduro marches, the person said, leading bosses to threaten people with firings. Reuters could not establish the size of the marches or if there were any firings as a result.\n\nFour of the people Reuters spoke to reported that even the motorbike-riding ‘colectivos’ were attending fewer events and have not been mobilized to push people into public support of the government. Their ‌members have been responsible for killing opposition figures and anti-government protesters, according to reports, which Reuters has not independently confirmed, from organizations like Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe person in Mara said many colectivo members are now working as motorbike taxi drivers, failing to show up to marches despite threats from ‌local authorities to revoke their mototaxi work permits, the person said. \"They hide, they fake an illness and a few have gone to Colombia.\"",

    "title": "NASA's Artemis II Spacesuits Still Have One Big Problem, According To Former Astronauts",
    "description": "As NASA prepares to kick off the Artemis missions, experts have noticed a potentially dangerous issue with a crucial component: the newly designed spacesuits.",
    "fullText": "You would think that NASA has everything ironed out for its biggest mission series yet: the Artemis missions, which will eventually send a crew of astronauts to the lunar surface. But as Artemis II gears up to launch and the rocket is prepared for takeoff, NASA is still adapting, though not necessarily for the better.\n\nFor example, the Artemis II Orion craft had a potentially dangerous flaw that saw NASA adjusting its reentry trajectory to address it. That flaw was originally discovered during the Artemis I mission, when the craft's heat shield saw char loss. Meanwhile, the new spacesuits pose another big problem: They will reportedly be heavier and bulkier than those worn during the Apollo missions (dubbed the Armstrong spacesuit). After over half a century, the astronauts will be wearing suits that have taken a step backwards in the heft department. It may not seem concerning since they'll be bouncing around in zero gravity, but former astronauts put that idea to bed. Being on the moon will actually create \"extreme physical stress\" on the astronauts for several reasons.\n\nKate Rubins, former astronaut and professor of computational and systems biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, explains that during a moonwalk, physical stress is elevated. For starters, \"people are going to be sleep shifting,\" which means they'll barely rest. Moreover, the astronauts will be wearing the suits for up to nine hours and doing EVAs (extravehicular activities or spacewalks) every day. According to Rubins, the spacewalks she did outside the ISS were like doing multiple marathons in succession.\n\nAs Rubin explains, the Axiom commercial suits (aka the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or AxEMU) will create added physical exertion and stress during the moonwalks. Not exclusively from the suits, but also equipment astronauts will be wearing and carrying, like a heavy life support backpack. The suits weigh over 300 pounds in Earth's gravity, though due to the lower gravity — about 1/6 of Earth's — they're lighter on the lunar surface. They'll still be heavier than the original 185-pound Armstrong suits. Each astronaut will also have to contend with the weight of the suit, the equipment, and their body mass collectively. Artemis III will not have a rover, either, so astronauts will be taking all physical exertion upon themselves to move equipment, tools, and other gear.\n\nThe AxEMU suits do a lot of things right, per official descriptions. They're safer and built to last generations, and they offer a custom fit for everyone. NASA and the Artemis astronauts promote the increase in mobility the Axiom suits offer. With a lot of those improvements thanks to the rear-entry design. Astronauts can get in and out themselves without help. Moreover, the suit is engineered for planetary or surface walks, which means support for legs, more upper mobility, and modular support to bring various tools.\n\nEven so, the weight may pose a challenge bigger than anyone is expecting. Former astronaut Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt, from the Apollo 17 mission, once remarked he would have designed suits to have \"four times the mobility, and half the weight.\" The AxEMU may have more mobility, but it's also heavier. We'll know soon enough how it works out, as NASA is already building the Artemis 3 rocket, which will fly after Artemis II's loop around the moon.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI collected ample proof that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused underage girls but found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men, an Associated Press review of internal Justice Department records shows.\n\nVideos and photos seized from Epstein’s homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn’t depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.\n\nAn examination of Epstein’s financial records, including payments he made to entities linked to influential figures in academia, finance and global diplomacy, found no connection to criminal activity, said another internal memo in 2019.\n\nSummarizing the investigation in an email last July, agents said “four or five” Epstein accusers claimed other men or women had sexually abused them. But, the agents said, there “was not enough evidence to federally charge these individuals.”\n\nThe AP and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential, that the Justice Department released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and it is possible those records contain evidence overlooked by investigators.\n\nHere are takeaways from what the documents show about the FBI investigation and why U.S. authorities ultimately decided to close it without additional charges.\n\nThe Epstein investigation began in 2005, when the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported that she had been molested at the millionaire’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. Then-Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta struck a deal letting Epstein plead guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. Sentenced to 18 months in jail, Epstein was free by mid-2009.\n\nIn 2018, a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea deal prompted federal prosecutors to take a fresh look at the accusations.\n\nEpstein was arrested in July of 2019. One month later, he killed himself in his jail cell.\n\nA year later, prosecutors charged Epstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, saying she’d recruited several of his victims and sometimes joined the sexual abuse. Convicted in 2021, Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term.\n\nLack of evidence for coconspirators\n\nProsecution memos, case summaries and other documents made public in the department’s latest release of Epstein-related records show that FBI agents and federal prosecutors diligently pursued potential coconspirators. Even seemingly outlandish and incomprehensible claims, called in to tip lines, were examined.\n\nSome allegations couldn’t be verified, investigators wrote.\n\nIn 2011 and again in 2019, investigators interviewed Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who in lawsuits and news interviews had accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with numerous men, including Britain’s former Prince Andrew.\n\nInvestigators said they confirmed that Giuffre had been sexually abused by Epstein. But other parts of her story were problematic.\n\nGiuffre acknowledged writing a partly fictionalized memoir of her time with Epstein containing descriptions of things that didn’t take place. She had also offered shifting accounts in interviews with investigators, they wrote.\n\nTwo other Epstein victims who Giuffre had claimed were also “lent out” to powerful men told investigators they had no such experience, prosecutors wrote in a 2019 internal memo.\n\nInvestigators seized a multitude of videos and photos from Epstein’s electronic devices and homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They found CDs, hard copy photographs and at least one videotape containing nude images of females.\n\nNo videos or photos showed Epstein victims being sexually abused, none showed any males with any of the nude females, and none contained evidence implicating anyone other than Epstein and Maxwell, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey wrote in an email for FBI officials last year.\n\nHad they existed, the government “would have pursued any leads they generated,” Comey wrote. “We did not, however, locate any such videos.”\n\nInvestigators who scoured Epstein’s bank records found payments to more than 25 women who appeared to be models — but no evidence that he was engaged in prostituting women to other men, prosecutors wrote.\n\nProsecutors weighed the possibility of charging some of Epstein’s close associates, including an assistant and business clients, but ultimately decided against it because of lack of evidence.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in February 2025 that Epstein’s never-before-seen “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now.” But FBI agents wrote superiors saying the client list didn't exist.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2024, about three weeks before President Joe Biden left office, then-FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate reached out through subordinates to ask \"whether our investigation to date indicates the ‘client list,’ often referred to in the media, does or does not exist,” according to an email summarizing his query.\n\nA day later, an FBI official replied that the case agent had confirmed no client list existed.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2025, two days before Bondi’s Fox News appearance, an FBI supervisory special agent wrote: “While media coverage of the Jeffrey Epstein case references a ‘client list,’ investigators did not locate such a list during the course of the investigation.”\n\nAaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___ The AP is reviewing the documents released by the Justice Department in collaboration with journalists from CBS, NBC, MS NOW and CNBC. Journalists from each newsroom are working together to examine the files and share information about what is in them. Each outlet is responsible for its own independent news coverage of the documents.",

They were 20 runs better than us throughout the whole match.\"\n\nAustralia are Ireland's next opponents on Wednesday as they chase a top-two finish to secure a place in the Super 8s.\n\nSpin dominated in Sunday's encounter at the R Premadasa Stadium and Stirling believes that could continue in the tournament.\n\n\"I think spin is going to be a challenge in this competition.\n\n\"Certainly, it wasn't coming onto the bat as much as it could have been.

    "description": "A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimi...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimination status.\n\n“Take the vaccine, please,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator whose boss has raised suspicion about the safety and importance of vaccines. “We have a solution for our problem.”\n\nOz, a heart surgeon, defended some recently revised federal vaccine recommendations as well as past comments from President Donald Trump and the nation's health chief, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the efficacy of vaccines. From Oz, there was a clear message on the measles.\n\n“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”\n\nAn outbreak in South Carolina in the hundreds has surpassed the recorded case count in Texas’ 2025 outbreak, and there is also one on the Utah-Arizona border. Multiple other states have had confirmed cases this year. The outbreaks have mostly impacted children and have come as infectious disease experts warn that rising public distrust of vaccines generally may be contributing to the spread of a disease once declared eradicated by public health officials.\n\nAsked in the television interview whether people should fear the measles, Oz replied, “Oh, for sure.” He said Medicare and Medicaid will continue to cover the measles vaccine as part of the insurance programs.\n\n“There will never be a barrier to Americans get access to the measles vaccine. And it is part of the core schedule,” Oz said.\n\nBut Oz also said “we have advocated for measles vaccines all along” and that Kennedy “has been on the very front of this.”\n\nQuestions about vaccines did not come up later in a Kennedy interview on Fox News Channel's “The Sunday Briefing,” where he was asked about what kind of Super Bowl snack he might have (probably yogurt). He also he eats steak with sauerkraut in the mornings.\n\nCritics of Kennedy have argued that the health secretary's longtime skepticism of U.S. vaccine recommendations and past sympathy for the unfounded claim that vaccines may cause autism may influence official public health guidance in ways contrary to the medical consensus.\n\nOz argued that Kennedy's stance was supportive of the measles vaccine despite Kennedy's general comments about the recommended vaccine schedule.\n\n“When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, get your vaccines for measles, because that’s an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against,” Oz said.\n\nThe Republican administration last month dropped some vaccine recommendations for children, an overhaul of the traditional vaccine schedule that the Department of Health and Human Services said was in response to a request from Trump.\n\nTrump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While federal requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nU.S. vaccination rates have dropped and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nKennedy's past anti-vaccine activism\n\nKennedy's past skepticism of vaccines has come under scrutiny since Trump first nominated him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation testimony last year, Kennedy told lawmakers that a closely scrutinized 2019 trip he took to Samoa, which came before a devastating measles outbreak, had “nothing to do with vaccines.”\n\nBut documents obtained by The Guardian and The Associated Press undermine that testimony. Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations said that Kennedy sought to meet with top Samoan officials during his trip to the Pacific island nation.\n\nSamoan officials later said Kennedy’s trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists before the measles outbreak, which sickened thousands of people and killed 83, mostly children under age 5.\n\nMixed messaging on autism, vaccines\n\nOz's comments mark a broader pattern among administration officials of voicing discordant and at times contradictory statements about the efficacy of vaccines amid an overhaul of U.S. public health policy.\n\nOfficials have walked a fine line in criticizing past U.S. vaccine policy, often at times appearing to express sympathy for unfounded conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists, while also not straying too far from established science.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing Tuesday, Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said no single vaccine causes autism, but he did not rule out the possibility that research may find some combination of vaccines could have negative health side effects.\n\nBut Kennedy, in Senate testimony, has argued that a link between vaccines and autism has not been disproved.\n\nHe has previously claimed that some components of vaccines, like the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, may cause childhood neurological disorders such as autism. Most vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella do not contain thimerosal. A federal vaccine advisory board overhauled by Kennedy last year voted to no longer recommend thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nAdministration public health officials often cite the need to restore trust in public health systems after the coronavirus pandemic, when vaccine policy and the general public health response to the deadly pandemic became a highly polarizing topic in American politics.\n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories about the public health system also spread during the pandemic, and longtime anti-vaccine activist groups saw a swell in interest from the wider public.\n\nKennedy, who for years led the anti-vaccine activist group Children's Health Defense, has been criticized for ordering reviews of vaccines and public health guidelines that leading medical research groups have deemed settled science.\n\nPublic health experts also criticized the president for making unfounded claims about highly politicized health issues. During a September Oval Office event, Trump asserted without evidence that Tylenol and vaccines are linked to a rise in the incidence of autism in the United States.",

    "fullText": "After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.\n\nMany stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.\n\nMillions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.\n\nAnd many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US President Donald Trump will not be one of them.\n\nThe Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.\n\nThe Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.\n\nLed by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.\n\nThis is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has reached his first Super Bowl in his first season with Seattle, whose fearsome defence is led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nMany of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.\n\nPuerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.\n\nHe will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years. He is also an actor, has hosted Saturday Night Live and been a WWE 24/7 champion.\n\nRock band Green Day, who are from California, will play an anniversary ceremony before Sunday's game and the NFL has teased that there will be some surprises at half-time.\n\nBad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of President Trump, and Bad Bunny's selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles.\n\nThe controversy even led conservative group Turning Point USA to plan an alternative half-time show, which will star singer and Trump ally Kid Rock.\n\nBad Bunny says he's losing sleep over the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend America's biggest game last year, but he said this year's on the west coast is \"just too far away\".\n\nAsked about the selection of Bad Bunny and Green Day, Trump added:, external \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he avoided the US on his current world tour because of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nThere were fears there would be raids around the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, plus further protests after two people were shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\nBut, speaking on Tuesday, the NFL's chief security officer Cathy Lanier said that no ICE operations are scheduled around any of the many Super Bowl events.\n\nShe added that the Department of Homeland Security sends a variety of different agencies to the Super Bowl, which it ranks as a tier-one event, and ICE is not one of them.\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough Sunday's game will take place at the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium is 45 miles south of the Golden Gate Bridge in Santa Clara.\n\nWhile San Francisco has been the main hub during Super Bowl week, events and parties have been spread around the Bay Area, beginning with Opening Night in San Jose on Monday.\n\nActor Jon Hamm hosted the NFL's end-of-season awards night on Thursday, which was attended by Steve Irwin's son Robert, who earlier in the day took a snake into the media centre to help promote the first NFL game in Melbourne later this year.\n\nShaquille O'Neal hosted a party on Friday while Post Malone held a free concert, with artists as diverse as Olivia Dean, Shaboozey, Sting, Calvin Harris, Zach Bryan and Teddy Swims playing at other events.\n\nCardi B also performed on Saturday before watching her partner Stefon Diggs play for the Patriots on Sunday, when Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones are also among the gameday performers.\n\nOther visitors include Roger Federer, Jay-Z, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and Paris St-Germain owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\n\nWahlberg's fellow New England fan Jon Bon Jovi will introduce the Patriots players on Sunday, with actor Chris Pratt, a Seattle supporter, doing the honours for the Seahawks.\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

    "description": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's behaviour towards her pupils was branded \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it was hard to see her returning - but she is back for Milan-Cortina 2026.",
    "fullText": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's \"tremendous coldness\" was described as \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it may have been hard to imagine her returning to her sport's biggest stage.\n\nFour years later, the highly successful coach is at Milan-Cortina - and not everyone is happy about it.\n\nTutberidze and her training methods were under the spotlight at Beijing 2022 amid the Kamila Valieva doping scandal that rocked the Games, and it was the then-IOC president Thomas Bach who gave the stinging assessment of the coach.\n\nRather than comforting 15-year-old gold medal favourite Valieva when she left the ice in tears after falling several times, Tutberidze had instead asked the youngster \"why did you stop fighting?\"\n\nBach said he had been \"very, very disturbed\" by what he had seen and that it did not give him \"much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past, nor as far as it concerns the future\".\n\nWell, that future is here and so too is Tutberidze.\n\nNot only is Tutberidze back at the Olympics, but she is apparently coach to another Russian teenage medal hope.\n\nThat skater is 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, who is here as a neutral athlete (AIN) as Russia's team are banned from the Games because of the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Tutberidze is not officially listed as the teenager's coach in the media guide for these Games and it remains to be seen whether she will be at rinkside when Petrosian competes.\n\nWhoever she is with, there will be many eyes on Tutberidze, with the shadow of Valieva and Beijing 2022 set to loom large.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nTutberidze's official coaching role is with the Georgia figure skating team and she was at Milano Ice Skating Arena for the team event to watch one of her longest-serving pupils, Nika Egadze.\n\nEgadze stormed to victory at the 2026 European Championships in Sheffield, where Tutberidze shared a warm hug with her skater after a gold medal-winning performance, and other athletes spoke positively about the coach.\n\nIt was a different story at Milano Ice Skating Arena as Egadze endured two error-strewn routines, with Georgia missing out on a medal.\n\nIn the short programme he made two early errors, failing to land the triple toe loop in his first technical element.\n\nAs he continued his performance, the TV cameras caught Tutberidze in passing - standing at rinkside, arms folded.\n\nEgadze did enough to pull the performance around and help earn Georgia fifth place in qualifying, progressing to the final. When he came off the ice, the hug from Tutberidze seemed curt.\n\nShe joined the Georgian squad as they waited for the results. Generally, waiting teams will laugh and joke, even if they know elimination is coming.\n\nInstead, the 11 skaters and team members sat stony-faced as the scores were announced.\n\nIf this was an indicator of the atmosphere in the team, it is certainly not positive, but it may have just been a moment of nervous focus.\n\nPerhaps Tutberidze was minding her body language on Sunday as Egadze struggled even \n\nHis coach gave him a pat on the hand as the numbers came in. Despite Egadze scoring only 154.79 for the free skate - 27 points lower than his season best - there was no berating.\n\nThe attention comes at a Games which began for Georgia with their team being roundly booed in San Siro when they entered the stadium during the opening ceremony.\n\nOfficial views on Tutberidze's presence in Milan vary.\n\nGiven she has not been personally implicated in any doping scandals and has not broken any rules, Tutberidze has every right to be at the Olympics.\n\nShe has rejected any suggestions of wrongdoing in her career as a coach and said in 2022 she was baffled by Bach's remarks.\n\n\"There was an investigation at the time and no issues were found that could be actioned against that individual,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a media conference on Sunday.\n\n\"If you are going to take action against someone, you need evidence, and from what I gather there isn't any.\"\n\nHowever, World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) president Witold Banka said on Thursday he does not \"feel comfortable with her presence here\",, external while Britain's 1980 Olympic champion and BBC pundit Robin Cousins was unequivocal in his disdain.\n\n\"This comes down to the International Olympic Committee and International Skating Union - coaches are not part of the team,\" Cousins told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So when they ban a team, the coach of said team is not part of that. That is not correct, as far as I am concerned. I would not have her anywhere near Milan, personally.\n\n\"Is that because of behaviour, or Russia being banned? All of the above.\n\n\"The way we watched everything unfold, someone has to take the blame. Any skater would say the most important person is the coach; you trust them, you give yourself to them. That is not how you treat a student.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, a television documentary - The Tutberidze Method - was released in Russia, celebrating her track record in training medal winners.\n\nTwo of Tutberidze's skaters have won women's gold and silver medals at the past two Olympics, but both were amid drama.\n\nAs the Valieva saga played out, Beijing 2022 champion Anna Shcherbakova was left barely celebrating victory – later saying she felt \"emptiness\" – while silver medallist Alexandra Trusova was so disappointed to miss out on gold that she said before the medal ceremony that she never wanted to skate again.\n\nFour years before that, in 2018, favourite Evgenia Medvedeva was sobbing after being upstaged by 15-year-old training partner Alina Zagitova.\n\nIn the run-up to those two Games, Tutberidze's skaters had been hot favourites, dominating the World Championships and European Championships.\n\nLittle has been seen of Petrosian recently on the international stage because of Russia's ban from competition. The only real sighting of her was at September's qualifying event in Beijing, where she won gold, but not all the top skaters were there.\n\nPetrosian has also won the past three national championships – making it 11 years in a row for Tutberidze skaters – and she is the first woman to land a quadruple loop in competition, but she was injured last year and has struggled with errors this season.\n\nFollowing the Valieva episode, the minimum age for competitors was raised from 15 to 17, an age that has not been far off retirement age for some of Tutberidze's skaters in the past because of a combination of injury and a drop in technical skills.\n\nIt has been reported that her training model centres around female skaters peaking before they hit puberty., external\n\nItalian Daniel Grassl, who went to work with Tutberidze in Moscow in 2023, described her as a \"very good\" coach, adding: \"She can be a little bit cold but she was warm with us, and was supporting us.\"\n\nValieva, a mercurial talent who performances drew worldwide attention, was eventually banned for four years over her failed drugs test, but there were no sanctions for any of her entourage.\n\nHer team have always insisted the failed test - for heart medication trimetazidine - was the result of contaminated cutlery which had been tainted by her grandfather's medication, while Wada called for those behind the failed test to face justice because \"the doping of children is unforgivable\".\n\n\"Wada is not behind the decision to accredit the coach [for Milan-Cortina],\" Banka said. \"The investigation found no evidence this person [Tutberidze] engaged in the topic, so there is no legal basis to exclude her.\"\n\nValieva, now 19, has only just returned to skating, finishing sixth in the semi-finals of the Russian Jump Championships last week. She is no longer coached by Tutberidze.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has not had many tougher weeks in her managerial career.\n\nHaving fallen 12 points adrift of Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Manchester City, suffering back-to-back defeats in the process, pressure was at its highest.\n\nShe faced backlash from her own supporters, questions over her position at the club, and anything other than victory at Tottenham would have been a disaster.\n\nThe club rallied around the Frenchwoman, who led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble in her debut season, by announcing she had signed a four-year contract extension 48 hours before their crucial game at Spurs.\n\nThat was the backing she needed and Bompastor could breathe a sigh of relief - and even celebrate animatedly - as her side got over the line with a 2-0 win.\n\n\"Even if we all know we can't control anything of that, we probably felt it was unfair to receive that amount of criticism,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"I know who I am, I don't need people outside my environment to tell me who I am. I will always make sure I give my best. I know I have the competence, I know I have the knowledge, I know the women's game and I do my best for Chelsea.\n\n\"I'm not saying I'm the best one, I'm not saying I'm arrogant, but I know who I am. I always make sure I support my players in the best way possible.\n\n\"My job is to make sure they go on the pitch with clarity on what they need to achieve. No-one is going to disturb me on my confidence.\"\n\nWith the WSL title seemingly out of their grasp, Chelsea's priority is to ensure they clinch a top-three spot and qualification for next season's Champions League.\n\nRivals Arsenal and Manchester United did their part earlier in the weekend - so Chelsea had to respond.\n\nTottenham, who started the game a point behind Chelsea, came out of the blocks firing and could have taken the lead when Olivia Holdt hit the crossbar.\n\nNervy Chelsea were in a battle until Keira Walsh's goal just before half-time rocked Spurs and put the Blues in the driving seat. It was the \"game-changer\" they needed.\n\n\"When you want to perform at your best, you need to have the four elements of the performance align at the highest level - the tactical, mental, physical and technical aspects,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"If one of them, or some of them, are not as high as possible, it affects the performance. We were a different team in the second half. That's who we want to be.\"\n\nBompastor's actions were deliberate on Sunday. After the warm-up, she walked out on to the pitch and high-fived every member of her squad.\n\nShe celebrated with assistant coach Meline Gerard, who lifted her up and spun her around in the dugout, when Walsh's goal put Chelsea 1-0 up - something she rarely does, but said afterwards she should do more.\n\nIn normal circumstances, a victory at Tottenham would be seen as par for the course. But this was three points which gave Chelsea a significant boost.\n\n\"I will enjoy it. I'm not going to lie, it's been a difficult time. It's been tough so we need to celebrate with players and staff,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"We know when we are at Chelsea we need to win every game and we want, as much as possible, to be in control. To do that, we need to get points to win.\n\n\"We still have a lot to play for. We know what we can improve.\"\n\nChelsea's performance still left much to be desired but Bompastor said she was \"really proud\" of how her players dealt with the unfamiliar criticism.\n\nThe Blues have won six successive domestic titles so most in the squad have never experienced a season without silverware.\n\nThey have already booked their place in the Women's League Cup final, have a fifth-round FA Cup tie to play and are in the Champions League quarter-finals.\n\nIf they win a European crown - the one trophy that has eluded them - their WSL blip will be quickly forgotten.\n\nBut experienced midfielder Erin Cuthbert said the overall feeling was \"relief\" after the Spurs victory - and this was unknown territory for the serial winners.\n\n\"It's been a tough couple of weeks, an experience that some of us haven't been used to. Over the 10 years I've been here, we've had moments like this,\" Cuthbert told BBC Two.\n\n\"The league's getting better and we've played against two top teams who probably beat us quite convincingly. It was back to the drawing board this week.\n\n\"We didn't want to be a Chelsea team who bow down game after game. That's not what we're about, that's not what we're built upon.\n\n\"It was a difficult first 20 minutes. We got quite lucky to be honest. But you're going to need a bit of luck to get out of a hole.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "\"You don't have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.\"",
    "fullText": "The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.\n\nAccording to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.\n\n“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”\n\nFive hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.\n\n“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.\n\nThe subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.\n\n“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.\n\nAs DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.\n\n“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”\n\nWhen uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.\n\nWhen Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.\n\n“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”\n\n“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”\n\nMore on DHS: There’s Something So Embarrassing About Homeland Security’s New Drone Video That We’re Gonna Have to Sit Down for a Minute",

    "fullText": "Travel content creator Murphy Ng saw something distressing while hiking near the Maliau Basin Studies Centre in Sabah, Malaysia, The New Straits Times reported.\n\nNg was walking along the Avian Trail with a ranger last December. At first, he didn't know what he was looking at.\n\n\"We spotted several piles of elephant dung along the trail, and I noticed something metallic and shiny,\" Ng said. \"At first, I thought it was just a small candy wrapper, but when I pulled it out, it turned out to be an entire plastic bag, completely intact.\"\n\nThe Times said that Ng shared the incident on Facebook. He encouraged people to be mindful of how they dispose of plastic as well.\n\nThis wasn't the first time an animal has had plastic in its digestive system, and it likely won't be the last. Even if the elephant did swallow a candy wrapper, plastic of all sizes can be harmful.\n\nEnvironment America reported that microplastics can make fish swim more slowly and damage their genes, which they can pass down to their offspring. A pregnant sperm whale was also found with almost 50 pounds of plastic in her stomach. All kinds of plastic waste kill over 1 million marine animals every year.\n\nThe effects of plastic pollution on marine life ripple out into how people live, too.\n\nAs microplastics disrupt how oceans absorb carbon, air pollution persists and warms the planet. Rising temperatures are contributing to extreme weather events, which can cause people to lose their jobs, homes, and ways of life.\n\nReducing plastic pollution helps people and wildlife live fuller lives in healthier and safer environments.\n\nPer the Times, elephant expert Dr. Cheryl Cheah said there are no known elephant deaths in Malaysia linked to plastic consumption.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSupporting brands that use less plastic or make plastic obsolete, such as Stasher bags, is crucial to reducing overall plastic use. But those options can be more expensive upfront and aren't accessible to everyone.\n\nEncouraging and advocating for brands to use less plastic, especially if it's a coordinated effort, can help. Even making sure your plastic makes its way into the trash instead of the grass can reduce pollution in ecosystems.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Manchester City's win at Liverpool ended in complete chaos - but did the referee and the VAR get Dominik Szoboszlai's red card right?",
    "fullText": "Sometimes the video assistant referee (VAR) just cannot win, stuck in a hole between what feels right in the spirit of the game and what is correct in law.\n\nManchester City thought they had scored a third goal at Liverpool which would have capped off one of the most dramatic ends to a Premier League game this season.\n\nBut it was stripped away by a VAR review for a foul committed just before the ball rolled over the line.\n\nFans will hate it, pundits won't like it, and football will turn its nose up too. Yet there really was no way the VAR, John Brooks, could not intervene.\n\nA foul was committed that facilitated a goal being scored which might have otherwise been prevented. It is really as simple as that.\n\nIt was a unique set of circumstances right at the end of a dramatic game which gave City a 2-1 win at Anfield.\n\nHere's what happened and why...\n\nMan City fight back for dramatic late win at Liverpool\n\nWith Alisson marooned upfield for a set-piece as Liverpool searched for a late equaliser, Rayan Cherki kicked the ball towards an empty net from just inside his own half.\n\nHaaland gave chase and was clearly going to outpace Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nThe City striker had overtaken Szoboszlai 25 yards from goal and looked certain to win the race - but he was pulled back.\n\nIt was a clear foul which referee Craig Pawson identified, but he played an advantage.\n\nAs the ball rolled towards the goal with the same two players still jostling to reach it, Liverpool's Hungary international was about to slide in and clear it off the line.\n\nBefore Szoboszlai could do so, however, Haaland pulled him back, and that stopped the home player from keeping the ball out of the net.\n\nThe first pull on the Norway striker muddies the waters. After all, it seemed Haaland was definitely going to score.\n\nBut they are two distinct situations. You have to separate the first foul by Szoboszlai and the subsequent offence from Haaland.\n\nWould Szoboszlai have prevented the goal had he not been fouled? There is a high chance.\n\nOn that basis it is impossible for the goal to stand.\n\nRemember that Pawson played advantage. Had Szoboszlai been allowed to successfully keep the ball out, the play would have been brought back and he would have been sent off.\n\nThe end result would be the same as the outcome of the VAR intervention: no goal and Szoboszlai sent off for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\n\nIf you take out the first pull on Haaland, it is hard to see how anyone could have a problem with the goal being disallowed.\n\nThis is not the first time, or the last, that the VAR has correctly disallowed a goal and people really struggle to stomach it.\n\nYes, the goal could be important for Manchester City at the end of the season. But the goal conceded could also turn out to be vital for Liverpool.\n\nWhile the video assistant referee's intervention was ultimately correct, leading to Pawson to announce the decision to both teams and the fans, it certainly split the crowd.\n\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville, who was covering the game for Sky Sports, said it \"feels so unjust\".\n\nHe added: \"I know there's rules but there is the smell of the game. Talk about killjoy. Just let the goal be.\n\n\"You have just killed one of the great moments of the season.\n\n\"You live to watch games like this. I am a fan of VAR, but it has just killed the joy.\n\n\"The reason fans watch football matches is for entertainment and for moments like that.\"\n\nBut ex-Manchester United captain Roy Keane said, if anything, the moment \"just added to the drama\" and described it as \"great\".\n\nManchester City forward Haaland said he actually felt sorry for his ex-RB Salzburg team-mate Szoboszlai.\n\n\"The referee has to follow the rules,\" Haaland told Sky Sports. \"I feel bad for him. Just give the goal and not the red card, simple as that.\n\n\"But that's the rules and that's how it is.\"\n\nCity boss Pep Guardiola simply told BBC Match of the Day: \"Come on referee, give the goal and go home.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): Huge save at 2-1 to keep Manchester City ahead in their win at Liverpool. This is why they bought him in - he's the guy to make big saves. He commanded his area really, really well. He wasn't able to keep a clean sheet but that was because arguably the goal of the season got put past him. He was fantastic.\n\nJayden Bogle (Leeds): Excellent going forward, he has played a number of positions this season for the team but I thought he was excellent in the 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest. He was a real outlet down that right side which is obviously huge for them and a massive three points for being safe and staying up.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City) and Axel Disasi (West Ham): Both of them have had an instant impact when they've come into the team. Disasi has to defend a bit deeper at West Ham - big, organised, putting his body on the line. He gives them a physical presence they've missed.\n\nMarc was a little lucky with the Mohamed Salah pullback - to still be on the pitch. But his leadership experience for Abdukodir Khusanov was exceptional. The level of confidence he gives this Manchester City backline is huge. Him hitting the ground running was exceptional for them.\n\nEl Hadji Malick Diouf (West Ham): Wonderful cross for the goal in the win at Burnley. He's been sensational since he came back from the Africa Cup of Nations. He's really added pace, power and a little bit of bite they have been missing down that side. He didn't have a great start to the season but we're starting to see the full potential of him now.\n\nVitaly Janelt (Brentford): He obviously gets a goal - wonderful header - but I actually thought he was just the best player on the pitch in the 3-2 win at Newcastle. I agree with Jordan Henderson in the sense he should have had the man of the match but he played well, kept it simple, broke up the game, broke forward when he needed to. A real solid midfielder's performance.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): What a difference a manager makes - being able to be free, get on the ball, go wherever he wants and be creative. I think Michael Carrick takes a lot of credit for that but again, another goal for him against Spurs, another win for United - he has to go in.\n\nRayan (Bournemouth): He was fantastic in the draw with Aston Villa. We have to look at Lucas Digne defensively but everything he did, running forward with pace, power, direct. He caused problems throughout the day. He's a big strong boy that gets his team up the pitch and he gets at the opposition - and Digne had no answers for him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): We're going to put him in the 10 even though he played right-back, but when you score a goal like that you're in. Unbelievable free-kick against Manchester City with pure technique to slice across the ball to make it swing from left to right and leave Donnarumma stranded.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): His first start back under Liam Rosenior, talking about getting his fitness back up. He loses a few points because he was against a very bad Wolves team. However fantastic, a hat-trick, goals, penalties, confidence. The most important thing is he's smiling again - that's great for Chelsea and great for England so he deserves that, as does Rosenior for giving him that.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): I don't normally give subs the opportunity to start but Gyokeres to be fair came on at 60 minutes against Sunderland and scored two goals to get Arsenal over the line. Strong from him. Maybe having Jesus and Havertz around is going to bring out the best from him from a competitive point of view. But it's a fantastic day for him and a fantastic day for Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): Huge, huge result for him at Anfield. His changes influence the game, and I think with Arsenal winning it's do or die and City put in a solid performance. Still wobbly, still a few question marks but they got the result which is all that matters.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

Just.\n\nBoss Pep Guardiola joked afterwards about their last victory at Anfield five years ago, which came behind closed doors during Covid restrictions, saying: \"That doesn't count, right?\"\n\nBut this brilliant turnaround meant City are only six points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 13 games left to play - including a Gunners visit to Etihad Stadium in April - having been staring at a nine-point deficit in the closing stages.\n\n\"It is so difficult, Anfield is Anfield - the tradition, the history and the crowd,\" added Guardiola. \"It always looks smaller, tighter here and the pitch doesn't look like Etihad Stadium - and the players that they have, and everything.\n\n\"Of course we would be disappointed and all the questions would be over and over [about the title race] but six points is better than nine. It is still a lot considering how strong Arsenal are in all departments.\n\n\"The last 10 games, from my experience, it is so difficult. The important thing is to try to be there and improve because the second half was not good enough again.\n\n\"All we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal and being there, try if they go slip [up] and use it.\"\n\n'Killjoy' - did VAR get late drama in Liverpool v Man City right?\n\nPremier League: Man City fight back to beat Liverpool as Szoboszlai sent off in dramatic finish\n\nThe City substitutes piling over to their fans after Cherki's goal showed how much the victory meant to them - one supporter even got carried away and jumped on to the pitch before being led away by stewards.\n\nIt was an incredible conclusion to an engrossing encounter, one that has repeatedly delivered drama in Guardiola's past tussles with Jurgen Klopp and now Arne Slot.\n\nThese two sides have been the only teams to lift the Premier League trophy over the past eight years and, while reigning champions Liverpool have fallen away this term and sit in sixth place, City are clinging on.\n\n\"What can this do to Manchester City confidence-wise, going forward?\" said former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's all about putting runs together at this stage and that is a massive result that can give them a huge confidence boost.\n\n\"They might well just - and I mean just - be in this.\"\n\nAfter their 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium earlier in the season, City achieved a league double over Liverpool for the first time since the 1936-37 campaign.\n\n\"It's an important one for City today,\" former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport. \"It's a tough place to go, Anfield.\n\n\"I thought Liverpool were really good in the second half, City were really good first half - then City have gone a goal down and dug in to get the three points.\"\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville added: \"Will this give them the bit between the teeth? Will this give them the confidence to go and chase down Arsenal?\n\nCity captain Silva started the game after recovering from a recent hamstring issue and was the catalyst for his side's comeback by prodding in the equaliser from a Haaland knockdown.\n\nThe Portuguese has now played more game against Liverpool (16) than any other City player, while his three goals at Anfield makes him City's joint-top scorer at the stadium alongside Nicolas Anelka and Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nHaaland, by contrast, scored a first goal at Anfield with his winning penalty in the third minute of added time.\n\n\"I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over,\" said Silva. \"We felt like we needed to win.\n\n\"The hope is there and we are going to fight until the end. We need to keep doing our job that we haven't lately.\"\n\nOn Sunday, no player ran more than Silva's 12.84km, while no City player made more passes in the final third than his 24, nor did they attempt more dribbles than his four.\n\nEarlier this season, Guardiola said he has a \"weakness\" for the 31-year-old and a player he \"loves\" very much.\n\nSilva is out of contract in the summer and the City boss added: \"He is one of the best players I have every trained with.\n\n\"He is the perfect captain. It is a joy for me as a manager to have him. The team comes first.\n\n\"His contribution is massive and he is one of the legends of this club.\"",

    "fullText": "A Caldwell company agreed to change its advertising after Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s office accused the business of misleading customers.\n\nLabrador’s office sued Right Now Heating, Cooling & Plumbing, alleging it was running deceptive direct-mail advertisements that claimed customers could obtain a furnace or air conditioning unit for a discounted price. Right Now denied the allegations.\n\n“You can get rid of your old furnace and replace with a brand new, top of the line furnace for $1,200,” one of the advertisements said.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office alleges that the claim and others made by the company were not true.\n\nThe lawsuit said that to get a new furnace, the customer would have to pay the installation cost for the furnace and a new air conditioning unit, and Right Now’s ad “does not disclose clearly and conspicuously the cost of the furnace or provide the complete cost to purchase and install both units.”\n\nLabrador’s office said customers have complained that the company failed to provide them with an itemized contract identifying the equipment and services they agreed to buy, and that they were provided a document titled “estimate” that the company contended was a sales contract.\n\nLabrador’s office said the company’s “estimate” had a tendency to mislead or confuse reasonable customers. It accused Right Now of a pattern of unfair competition and deceptive acts that violate the Idaho Consumer Protection Act and the Idaho Rules of Consumer Protection.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office and Right Now agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in which the company agreed to change its advertising to clearly disclose the total cost it charges customers to purchase and install its HVAC products. For instance, if the company advertises that a customer can purchase an air conditioner for $1,475 installed, it must sell the air conditioner for that price.\n\nThe agreement, in which Right Now does not admit liability, requires the company to keep all records related to customer complaints it receives for two years after the date it takes effect.\n\n“Right Now’s stipulations to the terms of this assurance do not constitute admissions by it to any facts or violations of any state or federal law, rule or regulation,” the agreement says. “Right Now enters into this assurance for the purpose of resolving the Attorney General’s concerns ... “\n\nThe company agreed to pay the Attorney General’s office $6,500 for fees and costs it incurred in pursing the lawsuit.\n\nCanyon County District Judge Randall Grove approved the agreement on Dec. 22.\n\nIdaho’s ban on buying candy or soda with food stamps is imminent.

    "title": "Green Day Just Called Out Trump After the President Refused to Attend the Super Bowl & Called Them a ‘Terrible Choice’",
    "description": "Likely thing for them to do!",
    "fullText": "Green Day has never been part of the MAGA agenda. The California rock band has called out Donald Trump and his administration in many of their music performances, and it doesn’t look like they’re stopping any time soon.\n\nIn recent years, the band—consisting of members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tré Cool—has replaced the lyrics of their iconic hit “American Idiot.” The song, written in 2004, initially included the lyrics “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda.” Now, when performing the song live, Armstrong sings, “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” The song itself, and the titular album it was written for, was a direct criticism of George W. Bush’s administration and the Iraq war.\n\nTrump Finally Addresses Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Abduction Years After She Called His Behavior 'Crazy' at Town Hall\n\nWhite House Officially Addresses Trump & Vance Feud Rumors After Reports the President Is Prepared to 'Strike' Against the VP's 'Betrayal'\n\nArmstrong also takes a jab at Vice President JD Vance through revised lyrics of “Jesus of Suburbia.” So what’s the beef between the president and the band?\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected into office in November 2016, the band led a chant  “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” during an appearance at the American Music Awards.\n\nDuring the first days of the first Trump administration, Billie Joe Armstrong wrote on Instagram about his immigration executive orders that targeted countries with large Muslim populations: “I feel like I’m in a state of shock. The executive orders Trump is signing feels like a vendetta.. Trump is not only taking out his revenge on the people who protested him, but also the average American that just didn’t vote for him.”\n\nHe continued, “These reckless decisions on healthcare, muslim-americans, immigration, environmental protection, freedom of speech, freedom of press, women’s right to choose what to do with their bodies, suggesting sending in the feds to Chicago .. are signs of a man that is trying to redefine what it is that keeps our common union as Americans. This is not just his ‘conservative agenda.’ It’s an all out assault on our civil liberties. His intention is to divide us as Americans. Maybe we don’t agree on all of these issues.. But can’t we see eye to eye on some?”\n\nIn an interview with NME, Armstrong said that Trump supporters were mostly “uneducated white working-class people.” Armstrong added: “That’s the problem right there. There’s this white nationalism that’s been brewing under the radar for a long time. But now [Trump’s] been able to cause people to lash out and blame minorities and it’s really confusing. I mean, blatant misogyny going on at the same time.”\n\n“I’ve got family members from Oklahoma that are big Trump supporters. And there’s no clear answer on why they’re supporting him because he doesn’t even have any policies,” he continued. “How can you have an opinion about who you want for the Leader of the Free World when the guy running doesn’t have answers to any questions?”\n\nWhen the band performed in Washington D.C., Armstrong emphasized that the sentiments didn’t feel as intense or different as other concerts. “Outside of “f—k you,” not a real lot, honestly,” the lead singer told Rolling Stone. “People know how I feel. I feel like going negative is just throwing fuel on the fire. I feel like the government is trying to create a culture war between us in a lot of ways. They’re trying to get between your average citizens based on red and blue. I think we’re in a crisis mode right now. For me, it’s important to get back to fundamentally what it feels like to be an American. We all come from different backgrounds, but we come together and create this world. It’s like a microcosm for the rest of the world. I want people to feel unity when they come to a show. At the same time, I’m not going to puss out on saying what I feel about him and his administration.”\n\nWhen asked about their obligations in the Trump administration, Cool said, “I think we have an obligation to put on a fun show and put on a concert that’s memorable, that’s energetic and that spreads joy and open-mindedness. If being open-minded and joyful is against your political beliefs, then you know, fuck you.”\n\nIn June 2025, Armstrong shared his feelings about the president. “Donald Trump in his administration is a fascist government,” Armstrong told the crowd at Download Festival in Donington Park in the U.K. . “And it’s up to us to fight back.”\n\nGreen Day was announced as a performer in the opening ceremonies for Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif., a couple of miles away from the band’s roots. When asked about whether he’ll attend the football game, Trump told reporters that he would not and then criticized the performers, which also included halftime performer Bad Bunny. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nIn their first performance of 2026, the band made their stance loud and clear with the iconic “American Idiot” line. During the performance of “Holiday” and “Know Your Enemy,” Armstrong said, “This song is anti-fascism. This song is anti-war. We stand up for our brothers and sisters in Minnesota. … Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Miller now has the floor,” referring to the ICE raids in Minneapolis that resulted in the deaths of Alex Pretto and Renee Good, while the latter line is a direct reference to homeland security advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nArmstrong also added the same sentiments when the band performed at a Super Bowl pre-show hosted by Spotify and Fanduel on Friday, Feb. 6. “This goes out to all the ICE agents out there. Wherever you are: quit your shitty-ass job. Quit that shitty job you have.” He added, “come on this side of the line.”\n\n“Because when this is over — and it will be over at some point in time — Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, J.D. Vance, Donald Trump, they’re going to drop you like a bad f—king habit.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",
