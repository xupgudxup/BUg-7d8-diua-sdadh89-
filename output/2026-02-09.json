    "fullText": "Patrick Reed has found a way to stay in the spotlight, even though he is spending this season away from both the PGA Tour and LIV Golf.\n\nThere is no doubt that Reed is focused on making an impact on the DP World Tour this year.\n\nIt was after his win at the Dubai Desert Classic when Reed mentioned that he had not yet signed a contract with LIV Golf for 2026.\n\nLIV had expected him to sign. But soon after, the American confirmed his departure from the league and announced plans to spend most of his season on the DP World Tour while serving a one-year suspension from the PGA Tour.\n\nReed’s suspension is set to end in August, but he was already planning to return as a past champion. His recent win at the Qatar Masters has nearly secured him one of the 10 full cards available through the DP World Tour.\n\nHowever, with two wins already this year, there are growing calls for him to be reinstated sooner rather than later.\n\nRyan Lavner discussed the possibility of an early return on the Golf Channel Podcast and argued that the PGA Tour should make use of Reed’s current form.\n\n“I love this idea because if we’re already rewriting the rules with this Returning Member Program, here’s another rule that they should write in: a battlefield promotion on the DP World Tour.\n\n“If you win three times, you should automatically jump to the PGA Tour. They already do it for the Korn Ferry Tour. You do have the strategic alliance, expedite Patrick Reed to the PGA Tour if he wins one more time,” he stated.\n\nIf Reed gets the chance to return to the PGA Tour and takes it, it would be a blow for the European circuit.\n\nHe has given an immediate lift to some of the DP World Tour events that do not carry the same profile as those in the Rolex Series.\n\nAs of now, it looks like his first event even partly connected to the PGA Tour will be at the Scottish Open in July.\n\nWith his world ranking now inside the top 20, Reed should also qualify for The Players Championship in March.\n\nBut his suspension is set to keep him out of TPC Sawgrass unless a rule change opens that door. On current form, it is a case they might need to look at more closely.\n\nChris Gotterup’s ‘problem’ highlighted despite WM Phoenix Open triumph\n\nChris Gotterup addresses WM Phoenix Open crowds following Hideki Matsuyama incident",

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nAhead of the much-anticipated bout between the Seahawks and the New England Patriots, Booker had an exchange with model Kendall Jenner on Instagram that added a new twist to the big game. Jenner released a betting campaign with Fanatics Sportsbook, leaning into a long-running joke about her past relationship history with NBA players — including the Suns star.\n\nWhile promoting it on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, Jenner picked the Patriots to win the Super Bowl.\n\nJan 7, 2026; Memphis, Tennessee, USA; Phoenix Suns guard Devin Booker (1) drives to the basket as Memphis Grizzlies forward Jaylen Wells (0) defends during the first quarter at FedExForum.

Known as a leader for the Suns and a franchise cornerstone, Booker’s ability to bring lightheartedness and sarcasm into the moment showcases his personality off the court.\n\nEven between those who have shared a past, being able to poke fun, look back and share a laugh is something worth noting.\n\nCardinals’ Budda Baker weighs in on Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl Halftime Show",

    "fullText": "The NFL inevitably will expand the regular season to 18 games. It's a matter of \"when\" not \"if.\"\n\nAs to the when, it could still happen the season after next.\n\nPer a source with knowledge of the situation, the lingering absence of a specific date for Super Bowl LXII in Atlanta is tied directly to the possibility of the season expanding for the 2027 season. With 17 games, the game would be played most likely on Sunday, February 13. With 18 games, it would slide to Sunday, February 20.\n\nAnd if 18 games comes with a second bye, the NFL likely would have to start the 2027 season on Labor Day weekend. That hasn't happened since 2001.\n\nLast Monday, Commissioner Roger Goodell said it's \"not a given\" that the regular-season will expand. The next day, interim NFL Players Association executive director David White said the players have \"no appetite\" for adding another game.\n\nOnce the NFLPA hires a permanent executive director, the league apparently plans to make a move on moving the season to 18. And the door for 18 by 2027 will remain open until Super Bowl LXII locks into February 13, 2028.",

    "description": "Third baseman Caleb Durbin was traded to the Boston Red Sox in a six-player deal with the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday.",
    "fullText": "MILWAUKEE — Third baseman Caleb Durbin was traded to the Boston Red Sox in a six-player deal with the Milwaukee Brewers on Monday after finishing third in the NL Rookie of the Year balloting last year.\n\nMilwaukee acquired left-handers Kyle Harrison and Shane Drohan and infielder David Hamilton from Boston for Durbin and infielders Andruw Monasterio and Anthony Seigler. The Red Sox also are receiving a competitive balance round B pick in July’s amateur draft, about 67th overall.\n\nDurbin, who turns 26 on Feb. 22, could fill Boston’s opening at third base created when Alex Bregman left as a free agent to sign a $175 million, five-year contract with the Chicago Cubs.\n\nThe 5-foot-7 Durbin, who plays third base and second, batted .256 with a .334 on-base percentage, 11 homers and 18 steals in 136 games while helping the Brewers win a third straight NL Central title and reach the NL Championship Series last season.\n\nMilwaukee acquired Durbin and left-hander Nestor Cortes from the New York Yankees for closer Devin Williams.\n\nThe Brewers had the third- and fourth-place finishers in the voting for the 2025 NL Rookie of the Year award that went to Atlanta Braves catcher Drake Baldwin, but neither player remains with the organization. Outfielder Isaac Collins, who finished fourth in the balloting, went to Kansas City along with pitcher Nick Mears in a December trade that brought left-handed pitcher Angel Zerpa to Milwaukee.\n\nDurbin’s exit from Milwaukee leaves the Brewers with an apparent opening at third. Joey Ortiz was the Brewers’ starting third baseman in 2024 but shifted to shortstop last season. Hamilton, among the players coming over from Boston, played one game at third base last year but primarily has worked at second base and shortstop.\n\nBoston also gained some infield depth.\n\nAfter losing Bregman, the Red Sox picked up Willson Contreras to play first base and now Durbin can play second or third.\n\nChief Baseball Officer Craig Breslow said the team hadn’t decided where Durbin would play but said he expects him to be a regular starter.\n\n“We’re just excited about getting a really good player into the organization, and we’ll figure out where he fits best,” Breslow said. “It just doesn’t feel like it makes sense to commit to anything right now.”\n\nMonasterio, a 28-year-old with experience at every infield position, hit .270 with a .319 on-base percentage, four homers and 16 RBIs in 68 games last season. Seigler, 26, batted .194 with a .292 on-base percentage, no homers and five RBIs in 34 games.\n\nHarrison, 24, was a combined 1-1 with a 4.56 ERA in eight appearances for the Red Sox and San Francisco last year. He came to Boston as part of the 2025 trade that sent Rafael Devers to San Francisco.\n\nHamilton, 28, hit .198 with a .257 on-base percentage, six homers, 19 RBIs and 22 steals for Boston last year. That followed a 2024 season in which he batted .248 with a .303 on-base percentage, eight homers, 28 RBIs and 33 steals in 98 games.\n\nMilwaukee selected Hamilton out of Texas in the eighth round of the 2019 draft, then sent him to the Red Sox in a 2021 trade that brought outfielder Jackie Bradley Jr. to Milwaukee.\n\nDrohan, 27, has never pitched in the majors. He went 5-2 with a 3.17 ERA and 77 strikeouts over 54 innings in 15 combined appearances with Triple-A Worcester and High-A Greenville last season.",

    "description": "Philadelphia Eagles news and links for 2/9/26.",
    "fullText": "What’s your biggest Eagles-related takeaway from the Seattle Seahawks’ Super Bowl LX win over the New England Patriots? Head over to The Feed and weigh in with your answer and explanation!\n\nLet’s get to the Philadelphia Eagles news and links …\n\nEagles QB Jalen Hurts introduced with “Super Bowl Legends” before big game between Patriots-Seahawks – CBS News\nPhiladelphia Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts was among the “Super Bowl Legends” introduced before Super Bowl LX between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. Hurts, Tom Brady, Joe Montana, Peyton Manning, Eli Manning, Steve Young, Jerry Rice, Emmitt Smith and Lynn Swann were all honored before kickoff at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. That’s quite the company for Hurts to be alongside. He was the only active player who was honored.\n\nEagles reportedly hire their Jeff Stoutland replacement – BGN\nThe Philadelphia Eagles reluctantly said goodbye to Jeff Stoutland last week after he spent 13 years as the team’s offensive line coach. Now they’re moving on and hiring Chris Kuper to fill the role. Kuper played offensive guard for the Broncos from 2006 to 2013 and most recently spent four years as the Minnesota Vikings’ offensive line coach. He also had a brief stint with the Broncos as an assistant OL coach under Vic Fangio from 2019-2021.\n\nFive Eagles-focused takeaways from the Seahawks’ win over the Patriots in Super Bowl LX – Inquirer\nStoutland’s sudden resignation, after coach Nick Sirianni was prepared to hire tight ends coach Ryan Mahaffey to assume run game duties, was further evidence that change is coming. The Eagles want an offense that has more variables and under-center plays that give quarterback Jalen Hurts more layup throws. Darnold’s lone touchdown pass came from under center when play-action caught Patriots linebacker Jack Gibbens. The quarterback found wide-open tight end AJ Barner for a 16-yard score early in the fourth quarter. How far will Sirianni go in altering the offense? It’s been relatively the same structure since 2021. The Eagles had great success with it, but last season’s regression was stark, and wasn’t all on first-time coordinator Kevin Patullo. How Hurts and the rest of the returning offense adapt is to be determined. But change is coming.\n\nImpressive performances from former Eagles in Super Bowl LX – NBCSP\nCB Josh Jobe: The Eagles signed Jobe as an undrafted free agent out of Alabama in the 2022 season and he was a part of their Super Bowl team that year. In 2022 and 2023, Jobe played in 28 games with the Eagles but has really made Seattle his home. Jobe, 27, was a full-time starter for the Seahawks’ dominating defense this season and he had a big game on Sunday in the Super Bowl. Jobe faced a team-high 10 targets on Sunday and gave up just 3 catches for 11 yards with a pass breakup, per NFL NextGen Stats. That’s the fewest yards allowed by any defender facing 10+ targets in a regular or postseason game since at least 2018. And his Super Bowl performance wasn’t a fluke. Jobe allowed a 46.1% completion percentage this season (regular season and playoffs), which was the fifth-lowest among qualified defenders in the NFL in 2025. On Sunday, the Patriots tried to attack Jobe and it just didn’t work. In addition to his coverage, Jobe also had 7 tackles (2nd most on Seattle behind Ernest Jones IV) and a TFL.\n\nThree free agents who make sense for the Eagles, version 1.0 – PhillyVoice\nRomeo Doubs (25), WR, Packers (6’2, 204). The Packers have a lot of noteworthy pass catchers in their offense, like Jayden Reed, Christian Watson, Tucker Kraft, Matthew Golden, and Dontayvion Wicks, and it was Doubs who led Green Bay in receiving yards in 2025. His career stats. Over his four-year career, Doubs has been a consistent producer in a crowded wide receiving corps, and he is still only 25 years old. He has also been a big-time producer in four career playoff games, making 20 receptions for 371 yards and 2 TDs. As you can see in the highlight reel below, Doubs runs good routes and knows how to create separation. Should A.J. Brown be traded, DeVonta Smith would step into the WR1 role, and Doubs would be a good WR2. If we’re to assume that new Eagles OC Sean Mannion’s scheme will look something like what Green Bay has run, then Doubs is an obvious fit in that role. As an added bonus, Doubs wears a ginormous helmet that Jalen Hurts will be able to see down the field.\n\n‘A brilliant mind:’ Why Sean Mannion’s Super Bowl peers believe the Eagles struck gold with their new offensive coordinator – PHLY\n“Every stop I’ve been, especially with Klint, listening to your feet is the No. 1 commandment of quarterback play,” Janocko said. “That’s something that Sean believes in as well because I know the guys up there in Green Bay preach a similar thing.” Lock added, “Timing footwork up with routes, specific plays, I think would be a big deal to him. It’ll be interesting to see what kind of offense he decides to run because I know he’s been around a couple different ones. I’ll be anxious to see where he’s kind of landing in this whole thing. But he’s going to be great. It’s going to be a fun offense.” Lock said he texted Mannion to congratulate him once the hire was announced, and revealed an important development for what to expect from the young coach in his first meeting with Jalen Hurts and the rest of the Eagles offense. The notes from the iPad have since been moved onto a laptop, one that is now headed to the NovaCare Complex. “He pulled all of his tape that he somehow accumulated over his career,” Lock said. “He’d pull up plays, talk about them that week, why we should run them.”\n\nSpadaro: Here’s what Eagles fans need to know as the 2026 offseason is underway – PhiladelphiaEagles.com\nWelcome to the 2026 NFL season and the understanding that the 32-team league is even-steven at 0-0 and the climb for the year ahead is well underway. Just to get your Midnight (or Kelly) Green blood flowing, here are some things to look forward to as the offseason enters racer mode and the action will be fast, furious, and extremely important. Much of what is happening inside the NovaCare Complex is for internal discussion only, and that’s the way it is around the NFL. The Eagles have coaching staff additions and subtractions, roster reviews, contracts to consider, and a whole lot of work ahead with the goal of, well, you know. So here is what’s up with the Eagles as 2026 rapidly moves forward …\n\nFamily confirms former NFL player and Super Bowl champion died in Orange Mound house fire – Action News 5\nFamily and friends are mourning the loss of former NFL player and Super Bowl champion Barry Wilburn. Family confirms he was the victim of a house fire in Orange Mound early Friday morning. [BLG Note: Sad news. Wilburn played for the Eagles from 1995-1996.]\n\nFormer Cowboys pass rusher DeMarcus Lawrence wins Super Bowl with Seahawks – Blogging The Boys\nYou may recall that Lawrence’s words were met with a lot of pushback from Cowboys fans when he first said them. He did so after initially signing with Seattle back in March. Whatever the case, he sort of called his shot and helped the Seahawks make good on it. He not only reached the NFC Championship Game in his first season away from the Cowboys, but he and his teammates went the whole way and lifted the Lombardi Trophy. Lawrence was able to add a huge achievement to his résumé. Congrats to him.\n\nSuper Bowl LXI Odds: Where do the Washington Commanders stand going into 2026? – Hogs Haven\nThe Commanders have the 19th-best odds to win next year’s Super Bowl. They have the third-best odds in the NFC East, and those odds match how the teams finished this season. Where do you see Washington finishing next season?\n\nNY Giants free agents 2026: Jermaine Eluemunor decision will be telling – Big Blue View\nRe-sign. Provided, of course, the free agent bidding doesn’t take the price to an exorbitant place. I like Marcus Mbow, but in my view he did not show enough in 2025 to remove a quality veteran and hand him a starting job. In terms of the draft, re-signing Eluemunor allows the Giants to focus on another position at No. 5. Even if the Giants did sign Eluemunor and still want to use the fifth overall pick on an offensive lineman, scouts believe Mauigoa, who I personally like more than Fano, might be a better guard. The Giants could start him at guard as a rookie, get his feet wet, then make a decision about whether or not to move him outside.\n\nThe Patriots’ transient luck was always too good to be true – SB Nation\nIf you had to take two things away from the season, notice also the importance of luck and exploiting your specific situation to its maximum output. The Patriots had a hilariously easy schedule, though that is owing mostly to the NFL’s own procedures to give terrible teams a chance at not-being-terrible the following year. But the playoffs also broke absurdly favorably; the Chargers (who weren’t good), the Texans (who were kind of good, but in a snowstorm), and the Broncos (who were good… without their quarterback, also in a snowstorm). The Seahawks were far and away the best team they faced this year; they got worked for 60 minutes, and none of it felt like a fluke.\n\n5 winners and losers from Patriots’ Super Bowl loss to Seahawks – Pats Pulpit\nQB Drake Maye: It was a rough Super Bowl debut for the Patriots young quarterback, as Maye finished 27-of-43 for 295 yards with two touchdowns and two interceptions en route to posting -0.44 EPA per dropback. Much of that production came late in the fourth quarter and Maye also lost a fumble on a strip-sack.\n\nSuper Bowl blowout is perfect end to the Seattle Seahawks’ 50th season – Field Gulls\nThis one feels so damn good. The fact that the Seahawks had to go through the gauntlet of the San Francisco 49ers, Los Angeles Rams, and the New England Patriots makes it all the sweeter. Winning in a dominant fashion puts the Super Bowl 49 loss in the grave and opens a new championship window for the Seahawks. For now, I won’t get ahead of myself. The Seattle Seahawks are once again Super Bowl Champions!!\n\nWho could Super Bowl champion Seahawks face to kick off 2026 season? – NFL.com\nHate them or love them, the Cowboys still bring the eyeballs. With Dak Prescott, CeeDee Lamb, likely George Pickens, Quinnen Williams and whatever other defensive moves Dallas makes this offseason, Jerry Jones’ squad would bring the glitz to another Kickoff Game. Dak versus the Seahawks No. 1 defense would be must-see television. The question is whether the NFL puts Dallas in back-to-back Kickoff Games?\n\nBGN Facebook Page: \nBGN Twitter: Follow @BleedingGreen\n\nBGN BlueSky: Follow @bleedgreennation.bsky.social\n\nBGN Instagram: Follow @BleedingGreenInsta\n\nBGN Manager: Follow Brandon Lee Gowton on Twitter | BlueSky | Threads\n\nBGN Radio Twitter: Follow @BGN_Radio",

    "fullText": "Braves reporter reveals Jurickson Profar's evolving role for Atlanta amid Sean Murphy's return originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nLast offseason, the Atlanta Braves signed Jurickson Profar in what was considered their biggest move of the winter. However, the team would go on to start 0-7, and Profar faced a suspension in his first week with the organization. This was far from an ideal start for the new signee and caused him to miss the first half of the season.\n\n“Veteran outfielder Jurickson Profar tested positive for a banned substance and began an 80-game suspension Monday, dealing a major blow to an Atlanta Braves team navigating a nightmarish start to the season. Profar tested positive for chorionic gonadotropin, a performance-enhancing drug, according to Major League Baseball,” ESPN’s Alden Gonzalez wrote.\n\nDuring last season, it became very clear that Profar was on thin ice, as fans remained upset about his off-field troubles.\n\n“Atlanta keeping Profar doesn't change the fact that the outfielder will still be on thin ice. The veteran is going to need more than a handful of nice moments to win back a frustrated fan base. It will take a solid season of production and help push the franchise back into the postseason chase. Until the outfielder is traded or this happens, there is still going to be a level of frustration with the poor choice Profar made. Something that will continue to define the outfielder's time in Atlanta for the foreseeable future,” ATL All Day’s Nick Halden wrote.\n\nThis season, Profar’s role with the Braves could vary widely, and much of it will be up to him.\n\n“I would expect Profar to be primarily used as a DH until Murphy returns in May. Yaz (vs. RHP) and Eli White (vs LHP) could get most of the time in LF. Once Murphy returns and Baldwin gets more starts as the DH, Profar would likely get more time in LF,” Braves writer Mark Bowman posted.\n\nProfar didn’t have a strong season last year, and with the way Atlanta is shaping this roster, he could find himself out of the lineup at times. He will need to hit well in the DH role and, once Murphy returns, be a reliable presence in the outfield. Ultimately, it all comes down to how much effort he wants to put in — for both his teammates and himself.",

    "fullText": "A Super Bowl is the pinnacle of football. It is what every kid dreams of winning, but what very few end up accomplishing.\n\nFormer Georgia Bulldogs running back Kenny McIntosh along with former Georgia analyst and assistant coach Mike Macdonald both achieved that rare accomplishment in the Seattle Seahawks' 29-13 win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 60.\n\nDespite winning a Super Bowl, this years ends up as a little bittersweet for McIntosh, who missed the entire 2025 season due to a torn ACL. McIntosh will get a Super Bowl ring, but he still has much to prove at the NFL level after having a season-ending injury.\n\nMcIntosh will enter 2026 with an opportunity to earn more playing time provided he makes a full recovery. Seattle lost running back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL in the playoffs and it is unlikely that Charbonnet will be able to return for the start of the regular season. McIntosh would've had a big opportunity to see playoff snaps after Charbonnet's injury if he were healthy, but instead those snaps went to George Holani.\n\nMcIntosh will compete with Holani to be Seattle's second-string running back behind Kenneth Walker next season. McIntosh is entering a contract year in 2026 and is set to make $1.1 million, so he'll have to prove his worth again in order to justify a roster spot for the Seahawks.\n\nThe former Georgia star won national championships in 2021 and 2022 and now is a Super Bowl champion.

    "fullText": "The 2026 NASCAR season is kicking off this weekend with the Daytona 500, and the series took advantage of record-breaking Super Bowl viewership to place an ad during the big game letting everyone know how exciting and all-American the sport is. This advertisement is a gauntlet slap in the face of Formula One, a return to the sport's roots, and a signal that it's going to lean in to fun and excitement this year rather than the manufactured drama of 2025's disappointing championship run.\n\nLook, if you're going to have my hometown racer Carson Hocevar ripping donuts in his Dale Earnhardt-livery pickup before blasting flamethrowers with the internet's favorite Cletus while \"Free Bird\" plays, I'm going to sit up and pay attention. Nothing is going to get me more excited as a fan than a rebuke of all things fancy and an all-American embrace of all things fun, loud, and brash. \"We don't come from royalty; we come from bootleggers and barn-builders.\" Hell yeah, brother! You can say that again.\n\nThere's a lot going on in this marketing campaign. Here's an abridged list of everything in the ad that caught my attention: Clint Eastwood's son Scott running from Jonny Law in a new Mustang; big smokey burnouts from Ford, Toyota, and Chevrolet sports cars; homages to classic American Cinema favorites \"Top Gun\" and \"Friday;\" and a cameo from NFL superstar Marshawn \"Beast Mode\" Lynch. What more could you ask for? Aboard a new Ford Mustang Dark Horse, Eastwood does a lurid tire-shredding burnout exiting an airplane hangar before running from the cops alongside one of those shine-running bootleggers that built the sport brick by brick.\n\nWell, I suppose we could ask for competitive racing, a points system that makes sense, a tight championship battle, and an exciting broadcast.\n\nPlaying the part of the protagonist of this ad spot, as well as its narrator, is actor Scott Eastwood. You might recognize him from the screen in his role as Little Nobody in the Fast & Furious franchise. He's used as visual shorthand here for action and excitement, fitting with the rest of the ad's theme.\n\n\"America's forefathers didn't throw tea in the harbor so they could sit quietly on rooftops and drink champagne,\" the ad begins. \"They did it so we could be loud. So we could be free.\" With the recent stratospheric growth of Formula One, this is pointed at NASCAR's main competition for racing fans right now.\n\nReturning to the now, Eastwood gives an iconic Tom Cruise–style fist-in-the-air salute before tearing off to inspire some of the best NASCAR drivers to let their inner hooligan come out to play. Bubba Wallace gives Marshawn a wild ride. Kyle Larson rips donuts around his wife while she shotguns a Coca Cola Classic. The aforementioned flamethrowers are lit.\n\nThe ad ends with some terrible computer generated action as the Mustang jumps off a freeway overpass to join the stock car pack on track and rip past the camera. It definitely looks dumb, but somehow the fakeness increases the hype.\n\n\"You want perfect turns and polite applause? You know where to find it. But if you want dust and dented fenders and a place to let loose, we've got a seat waiting for you. Coolers full. No dress code and no velvet ropes. With your people. Heart racing. Strapped in, screaming your damned lungs out.\"\n\nHell yeah! Here's hoping that NASCAR really turns up the heat this year.\n\nWant more like this?

    "fullText": "All season long, folks were waiting for the rug to be pulled out from underneath the New England Patriots. In Super Bowl LX, that finally happened, as the Pats were handed a devastating 29-13 defeat by the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nThe Pats’ struggles throughout the postseason reared their ugly head once again, and against a formidable Seahawks team, that proved to be too much to overcome. As difficult as it may be, we must look back at this game to figure out what went right and what went wrong, so let’s pick out four studs and four duds from New England’s final game of the season.\n\nWhat a way to end the year for Craig Woodson. The rookie safety led the Patriots with 10 tackles, three of which went for a loss. He also deflected a pair of pass attempts, as the defense did everything it could to hang in this game. The selection of Woodson in the 2025 NFL Draft was questionable, but he’s a surefire starter heading into 2026.\n\nAnother member of the secondary who put the clamps on Seattle’s top pass catchers was Christian Gonzalez. The superstar cornerback had four tackles and three pass deflections, and he played a primary role in holding the 2025 Offensive Player of the Year, Jaxon Smith-Njigba, to just four catches for 27 yards.\n\nThe former Philadelphia Eagles stud did all he could to replicate his performance from Super Bowl LIX. Williams had two tackles, both of which went for a loss, and the Pats’ only sack of the game. The $104 million man continually found his way into Seattle’s backfield, and he once again proved to be worth every dollar of his pricy contract.\n\nBesides Rhamondre Stevenson, nobody other than Mack Hollins really had anything going for them in this game. Hollins caught four passes for a game-high 78 yards and a touchdown, and while most of this production came when the game was out of reach, it’s fair to wonder if things would have been different had he been targeted \n\nWill Campbell had a solid rookie year, but there’s no hiding from his play in the postseason (even if he wants to keep ducking the media). Campbell allowed a whopping 14 pressures in this one, which was the highest total among all offensive linemen across the NFL in a single game this year. Simply put, you can’t win a title with this sort of performance.\n\nA desperate fourth quarter made Drake Maye’s numbers look better than they were (27/43, 295 YDS, 2 TD, 2 INT, 5 CAR, 37 YDS, 1fumble lost), but the tale of the tape tells the real story. Maye was jumpy in the pocket as he struggled to diagnose the Seahawks’ coverages, and while he faced a ton of pressure, his trademark accuracy was nowhere to be found.\n\nAdmittedly, the two guys above Josh McDaniels on this list were not 100% healthy for this game. And yet, even when given two weeks to prepare for this game, McDaniels had nothing in his bag of tricks to help either Campbell or Maye out. His conservative and wildly uncreative gameplan was appalling considering the stakes of this game.\n\nYou could put pretty much anyone else on offense here, but we’ll single out Kayshon Boutte, who turned his five targets into just one catch for 21 yards. Boutte has a crucial drop on a third-down play along the way, and given how frequently Maye was looking his way, his inability to help out his struggling quarterback earns him the final spot on this list.\n\nWill Campbell Position Change Discussion Rekindled By Super Bowl Stinker",

    "description": "Pascal Kaiser was attacked by three men outside his house just days after his public proposal.",
    "fullText": "A German soccer referee, who recently went viral for proposing to his boyfriend, was attacked outside his home.\n\nPascal Kaiser stole the hearts of millions last week after he proposed to his fiancé in Cologne’s RheinEnergieStadion during a match in front of 50,000 people. According to the French publication L'Equipe, Kaiser was assaulted in his home by three men late Saturday night into Sunday morning.\n\nThe publication wrote that the bisexual referee, prior to the incident, had reported that he was receiving threatening messages, including ones that included his address. Police told him there was no immediate threat. But Attitude reports that 20 minutes after he got off the phone with authorities, Kaiser was attacked while smoking a cigarette in his garden, which resulted in an injury to his right eye.\n\nCarla Antonelli, a Spanish politician and LGBTQ+ advocate, uploaded a post to Instagram in support of Kaiser and shared a photo of his bruised face. “Terrible message, if you make yourself visible, we’ll put you in the closet: Referee Pascal Kaiser, who proposed to his partner before the Cologne-Wolfsburg match, was assaulted at his home. It is known that prior to the assault, the address of Pascal Kaiser’s house had leaked on social media and received direct threats,\" her caption reads. \"Police intervened after the attack, and Pascal Kaiser is now in a safe place under police protection.”\n\nKaiser's Instagram account, and the couple's account he shares with his partner, are now both locked and private.\n\nLast week, Kaiser got down on one knee and professed his love for his fiancé while delivering a prepared speech, declaring, \"I want everyone to see that I love this person. A man. As a man. In football.\" After the proposal, FC Köln, a professional soccer team that plays at the field where they got engaged, uploaded a video of the couple's special moment and wrote in the caption, \"Pascal Kaiser is a referee and a huge FC fan. Pascal is queer and came out three years ago. Today, he had a special plan, which FC Cologne supported. Pascal proposed to his long-term partner at the RheinEnergieStadion, but see for yourselves!\" The team continued, writing, \"Congratulations, you two!”\n\nKaiser has long been an advocate for LGBTQ+ visibility in sports. As he previously told Schwulissimo, a major German news outlet, “I see this as my mission: to create visibility. To be a voice. And to encourage people who aren’t yet brave enough to speak up,” he said. “I know how lonely it can be to think you’re the only one. I want no one to have to feel that way again.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Out: German referee assaulted after viral proposal to boyfriend\n\nGay bars in New Orleans are still struggling after Bourbon Street terror attack\n\nHomophobic Attack on NYC Subway Leaves Woman With Fractured Spine\n\nDrag Race's Pixie Polite was 'hospitalized' after 'homophobic' attack",

    "title": "49ers predicted to make two major defensive line moves this offseason",
    "description": "The 49ers need to bolster their pass rush, and are predicted to pursue two splash signings to do so.",
    "fullText": "It’s no secret that the 49ers need to bolster their pass rush after struggling to pressure the quarterback without Nick Bosa for most of the 2025 season, and they are expected to make a pair of big moves in free agency to get their former Defensive Player of the Year some more help.\n\nAfter finishing last in sacks in a season in which Bosa suffered a torn ACL, it would be malpractice on the 49ers’ part not to commit significant resources to a defensive line that has gone from being a strength to being one of the biggest issues on the roster.\n\nThere are a lot of compelling prospects at edge rusher and on the interior of the defensive line in this year’s draft but, after selecting Mykel Williams, Alfred Collins and CJ West last year, the 49ers may be more inclined to look to proven commodities in free agency.\n\nAnd ESPN’s Ben Solak listed two names who he believes the 49ers will likely pursue as part of a defensive line overhaul.\n\nWriting as part of ESPN’s offseason preview, Solak said: “The 49ers will go for a defensive overhaul. Expect the 49ers to pursue John Franklin-Myers, an old pal of Saleh from his Jets days, and Trey Hendrickson, who makes sense on a one-year deal. They could swing for a big trade, too. Kayvon Thibodeaux, anyone?”\n\nIt’s difficult to envision the 49ers using premium draft capital on Thibodeaux with the needs they have elsewhere on the roster and the options that are available in free agency and via the draft.\n\nBut there’s reason to believe the Niners could well be in the mix for both Hendrickson and Franklin-Myers.\n\nThere were reports of the 49ers being interested in Hendrickson at the trade deadline, and it makes sense that they would still be keen on him as somebody who can be a true three-down player across from Bosa. His arrival would take a huge amount of pressure off Bryce Huff and Mykel Williams, who would surely benefit from Hendrickson’s experience and the increased opportunities to rush from the inside.\n\nWhile Franklin-Myers is a favorite of the now-former defensive coordinator Saleh, he figures to have significant value to the 49ers given his ability to operate inside and out.\n\nIn 2025 for the Denver Broncos, Frankin-Myers played 180 snaps as a defensive tackle and 388 off the edge. He brings versatility and consistent production, having followed up a seven-sack season in 2024 with 7.5 this campaign. He has racked up 33 QB hits in his time in Denver.\n\nAdding Hendrickson and Franklin-Myers, who at 29 is facing what will likely be his last opportunity to cash in on the open market, may be ambitious for the 49ers.\n\nBut, with their need for impact players up front and the possible free agent departure of a versatile talent who can thrive inside and out in Yetur Gross-Matos, pursuing Hendrickson and Franklin-Myers would be a sound approach by the 49ers that would put the defense in a much better position to succeed in Raheem Morris’ first year as the coordinator.",

    "fullText": "Dani Carvajal finds himself in a tricky situation at Real Madrid. Even though he has been back from injury for over a month, he has found game-time hard to come by under manager Alvaro Arbeloa.\n\nThe 34-year-old right-back has only played twice since returning, clocking less than 30 minutes on the field, with Arbeloa preferring Federico Valverde, and now David Jimenez, and Trent Alexander-Arnold ahead of the club captain.\n\nThe manager seemed to suggest after the Valencia game that Carvajal was not yet fully ready to return and did not want to take any risks.\n\nNow, AS reports that Carvajal travelled to London last week to undergo knee tests at a world-renowned specialist clinic.\n\nThe captain of Real Madrid was forced out of action in October last year due to the presence of a “free intra-articular body” in his kneecap, which caused him significant problems.\n\nHaving undergone arthroscopic surgery, Carvajal spent two months on the sidelines to recover from the problem.\n\nCarvajal has fully recovered from his knee issue. (Photo by Juan Manuel Serrano Arce/Getty Images)\n\nAnd, the tests carried out in London last week showed that issue has now been overcome, with the defender submitting the medical report to the club’s medical staff.\n\nCarvajal made the trip to England accompanied by Antonio Rudiger, who was familiar with the London clinic from his time at Chelsea and also took the opportunity to undergo a check-up.\n\nThe visit clarified doubts about that “free intra-articular body” which had been causing concern at Valdebebas. There is nothing serious. He is fit to play.\n\nDespite that, the 34-year-old right-back is not playing for Real Madrid, which could further jeopardise his place in the Spain squad for the World Cup.\n\nLuis de la Fuente wants Carvajal in the team, but also wants him to play regularly so that he can arrive at the tournament with form and rhythm behind him.\n\nSo, in case, his situation at Real Madrid does not improve, the veteran could lose his spot in the La Roja squad.",

    "fullText": "On Sunday, Lindsey Vonn courageously took part in the Tofane downhill run in Cortina d’Ampezzo, despite recently suffering a torn ACL.\n\nVonn [pictured below], who had come out of a five-year retirement to compete in her fifth Games, was looking to win her third Olympic medal.\n\nHowever, her journey at the Milano-Cortina event came to an end sooner than she would have hoped.\n\nThe 41-year-old was looking to become the oldest athlete to win a medal in the downhill event. Unfortunately for the American star, her dreams were ended when she crashed 12 seconds into her run.\n\nThe American has since undergone surgery after suffering a broken leg, and numerous athletes have sent messages of support.\n\nCarlos Alcaraz, the ATP number one, posted a short message on his Instagram story in support of the 41-year-old downhill skier.\n\nThe Spaniard said: “We’re thinking of you Lindsey Vonn!”\n\nIt is perhaps unsurprising to see Carlos Alcaraz commenting on such an issue. Since making his debut on the ATP Tour in 2020, the Spaniard has demonstrated that he is one of the most compassionate and relatable figures on the professional tennis circuit.\n\nAs an example, Alcaraz sent a heartfelt message to Jannik Sinner after the Italian was forced to retire from the 2025 Cincinnati Open final due to illness.\n\nHe said: “I’m so sorry for Jannik!\n\n“Nobody likes to win because their opponent retires, especially in a final like this. Wishing you a speedy recovery!”\n\nNorwegian skier Kajsa Vickhoff Lie, who finished seventh, revealed why Vonn crashed on Sunday.\n\nAs reported by The Guardian, she said: “It is a critical section, because it’s in the beginning, and you really need a lot of speed coming out of it.\n\n“It’s super flat after it, so the goal is to be as close to that gate as possible. She really nailed the turn, but she was too close to it, so she was hooked into it.\n\n“But that’s how it is with the Olympics – you really want to be at the limit, and she was a little bit over the limit.”\n\nBreezy Johnson, Vonn’s compatriot, won the downhill gold medal after posting a time of 1min 36.10sec, fending off Germany’s Emma Aicher\n\nAs for Vonn, her career as an Olympic downhill skier is likely over. Despite the crash, the American can take pride in her efforts and reflect positively on a career in which she won three Olympic medals – including one gold medal.",

Other teams are monitoring the evolving social media landscape and will take action accordingly.\n\nSocial media company X, owned by billionaire Elon Musk, in January prevented Grok from being used to edit images of real people in revealing clothing after OFCOM, the UK’s independent regulator for the communications industries, launched an investigation in January. It follows concerns the AI tool was being used to create sexualised images, affecting women and children, including female athletes.\n\nSignify, an organisation that works across multiple sports and with several WSL clubs to collect, triage and assess the threat online abuse poses to players, says it has been active on the Grok AI image manipulation issue since it first started in late 2025 and has shared advice with WSL and Premier League clubs on how to mitigate harm. But even though X has taken action, the issue is bigger than X and Grok.\n\n“Similar off-platform image manipulation tools are available and we have seen them also being used to produce concerning images and videos,” Jonathan Sebire, co-founder at Signify, says. “This will be a live issue for some time to come.”\n\nOFCOM is not currently investigating the off-platform stand-alone version of Grok because they do not fall under the Online Safety Act in the same way as on-platform versions.\n\nAn OFCOM spokesperson told The Athletic: “We can only take action on online harms covered by the Online Safety Act, using the powers we have been granted. Any changes to these powers would be a matter for government and parliament. The Secretary of State has said that the Government will look at how AI services should be regulated and we are supporting that work.”\n\nSignify has since added a solution which specifically detects manipulated images and reports them to X for action. “Encouragingly, we have seen the platform take strong action when dealing with content,” Sebire added.\n\nIn January, the European Commission announced it was launching an investigation against X under the Digital Services Act over Grok, including “the dissemination of illegal content in the EU, such as manipulated sexually explicit images”.\n\nIn January, Arsenal deleted a video on X and turned comments off on an Instagram post of new signing Smilla Holmberg promoting ticket sales because of inappropriate, sexualised and misogynistic comments.\n\nTottenham Hotspur also turned comments off on their X post announcing the arrival of Matilda Nilden, 19, for the same reason. Some of the replies asked X’s artificial intelligence tool Grok to produce sexualised images of the player.\n\n“It is really worrying,” Fern Whelan, women’s football equality, diversity and inclusion executive for the Professional Footballers’ Association, told The Athletic in a special investigation. “It’s difficult to manage unless it is stopped at source.”\n\nThe public body Sport England decided to stop using X last month to stay true to its values of ensuring “sport and physical activity are safe and inclusive for everyone,” it said in a statement.\n\nWSL Football has already scaled back on the use of X, prioritising Instagram and TikTok instead and continues to monitor the situation regarding Grok.\n\n“Online abuse is one of our highest priorities at the moment,” WSL Football Nikki Doucet told the media last month, urging the need to be proactive. “We have seen the speed in which and the change in the type of abuse that is happening. Some content is not illegal but there is a lot that is awful but lawful.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nSoccer, Sports Business, Women's Soccer\n\n2026 The Athletic Media Company",

The Los Angeles Chargers reportedly hired Adam Gase in an offensive assistant coach role, according to NFL Network's Ian Rapoport.\n\nHe’s back: After a five-year hiatus, Adam Gase returns to coaching in the NFL, joining the #Chargers as an assistant focusing on the passing game, sources say.\n\nThe former #Jets and #Dolphins coach rose in the ranks as a record-setting offensive mind. Now back to his roots in LA. pic.twitter.com/swCKTPt1bm\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 9, 2026\n\nGase was the former head coach of the New York Jets and Miami Dolphins. Gase had a combined 32- 48 record in his two stints as head coach. The 47-year-old was also the former offensive coordinator of the Denver Broncos and the Chicago Bears. During his previous stops, Gase closely worked with Peyton Manning, Jay Cutler and Sam Darnold.\n\nGase is now expected to closely work with Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert. Last season, Herbert threw for 3,727 yards, 27 touchdowns and 13 interceptions despite playing through a fractured left hand late in the season.\n\nGase will be part of the coaching overhaul that the Chargers have made this offseason. After the Chargers' 16-3 wild-card loss to the New England Patriots, the team fired offensive coordinator Greg Roman. Roman was replaced by former Miami Dolphins head coach Mike McDaniel.\n\nOn the defensive side, the Chargers hired Chris O'Leary at defensive coordinator after Jesse Minter was hired as the Baltimore Ravens head coach.\n\nThis story will continue to be updated.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool last remodelled their midfield back in 2023.\n\nJurgen Klopp and then-sporting director Jorg Schmadtke overhauled the Reds’ midfield - bringing in the likes of Alexis Mac Allister, Dominik Szoboszlai, Wataru Endo and Ryan Gravenberch.\n\nIt’s fair to say those deals have been successes - with Liverpool adding the EFL Cup to their trophy collection in 2024 before winning last season’s 2024/25 Premier League title.\n\nThe time has come however to consider adjustments to the midfield - owing in part to uncertainty over some players’ futures.\n\nWe could see Curtis Jones sold for example as the homegrown star stalls on a new contract. Endo - like Jones - is out of contract in 2027 with the club having listened to several offers for the Japan captain over previous transfer windows.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister has been heavily linked with Real Madrid and it remains to be seen what kind of conclusion contract talks reach with Gravenberch and Szoboszlai too.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nIt’s no wonder we’ve seen several midfield targets associated with an Anfield move ahead of the window opening. And one of those who HAS been sounded out for a deal is Newcastle’s wantaway playmaker Sandro Tonali.\n\nThe 25-year-old has been on Tyneside since 2023 - establishing himself as a consistent presence in both the Premier League and Champions League.\n\nBut it looks like the Italian international’s time with the Toon could be coming to an end. Under contract until 2028 the player’s agent revealed last week that it was perhaps time to consider his future.\n\nNewcastle will be against losing him for nothing in two years and so could be forced to entertain bids this summer instead.\n\nAnd a report in TEAMtalk is now claiming that Liverpool - as well as Arsenal and Manchester City have opened talks with the midfield schemer’s entourage over the terms of a deal.\n\n“Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester City have all made contact with Tonali’s camp,” the report reads.\n\nBut right now Premier League suitors appear to be in second place - with Tonali preferring a return to Serie A for family reasons.\n\n“The midfielder’s heart is pulling him back to Italy, where he wants to settle again with his family,” the report reads.\n\n“Juventus and Inter Milan are both extremely keen to make that happen.”",

    "fullText": "Coming up with drug candidates isn’t the bottleneck on finding new treatments. Can AI help with the things that are?\n\nClara Collier: I’m very excited to be talking to Abhishaike Mahajan. He works for Noetik, a startup that uses AI to develop cancer therapies, and he’s also one of my favorite bloggers. I’m interested in the intersection of biology and machine learning, and I’m also very, very confused by it. Abhi's writing has been extraordinarily helpful for me in untangling this whole topic. So, to start:  Where do you think the real applications of the technology are? What excites you — and why?\n\nAbhishaike Mahajan: Maybe I can start with my own background. I spent two and a half years at Anthem, a U.S. health insurance company, on a research team applying machine learning to electronic health records to predict who is likely to develop chronic health conditions two years out — essentially,  risk stratification models. I also spent some time there doing causal inference work, trying to answer questions like: If you're on one antihyperglycemic medication and you're, say, a Hispanic male in his 50s, what should the second-line therapy be? Right now, it's very much based on \"vibes.\" All of this was done with a data set of 50 million U.S. clinical claims that the company  had access to.\n\nIn my second job, I spent two and a half years at Dyno Therapeutics, developing better viruses for genetic therapy delivery. This involved a lot of mucking around with AlphaFold and other protein structure prediction and design models.\n\nAnd now, my current role revolves around learning better representations of tumor microenvironments, in the hopes that we can predict which patient populations are most likely to respond to a specific drug.\n\nThe career trajectory I have encapsulates many of the individual fields that have popped up in biological machine learning. If you look at the life cycle of machine learning in applied biology, it can be preclinical, clinical stage or postclinical. My work at the health insurance company was postclinical, dealing only with approved drugs. My current work at Noetik is clinical stage, where most of our interest is in investigational cancer drugs in Phases 1 through 3, although most of the current machine learning in biology that you’ll see is focused on the preclinical stage. The preclinical stage is a very machine learning-shaped problem, since imagination is a very high priority. There is no ground truth. You need to come up with a molecule, a protein, whatever.\n\nMy work at Dyno Therapeutics was closest to preclinical. There are viruses that exist in nature which have coevolved alongside humans that are typically used when delivering genetic therapies. The founding of this company was based on a paper that applied saturation mutagenesis to this particular virus — exploring the mutational landscape, like single amino acid substitutions — to try and figure out whether we can improve this virus's ability to, say, infect the brain, where we may want to deliver the virus’ genetic payload. The answer is yes.\n\nNow the next question is: how much can this be scaled? Dyno was started on that premise. From there on, you are into unobserved territory. You are in evolutionarily divergent territory. You can’t really depend on there being other viruses that closely relate to your existing ones, so you place a very high premium on your models being able to generate new things entirely. I worked with a lot of protein structure generation models — if you have a particular target in mind, can you hallucinate something that will bind to that target and then graft that onto the virus? Or can you use the model to modify larger sections of the virus?\n\nAbhi: This is BindCraft, yes. But BindCraft exists on a continuum of many different binder generation models. It’s arguably the best one — perhaps the point where the field was kind of solved, though others have reasonable disagreements with that, especially given how good the most recent models are. That was mostly preclinical work, since we were primarily testing in monkeys or mice.\n\nClara: There was an essay that went semi-viral recently by Claus Wilke: We Still Can't Predict Much of Anything in Biology.\" He specifically talks about BindCraft there, arguing  that we've had many generations of predictive computational tools claiming that we can do these things with proteins. BindCraft, in this tradition, is very good at what it does, but it has many gaps. You  still need extensive testing and a lot of research taste to make use of it.\n\nAbhi: I can see the argument that it’s perhaps not good at designing binders for intrinsically disordered proteins or proteins that have never been experimentally characterized before. Still, for the set of targets that are experimentally well characterized, where you  just want to generate interesting binders,  I'm inclined to think that it’s  transformative.\n\nPrior to BindCraft, the state-of-the-art method was generating hundreds of thousands of random peptides, folding them with your target of interest using AlphaFold, and then picking the ones with the best confidence metric. To some degree, before BindCraft, your only alternative was pure computational brute force. In that sense, all BindCraft is doing is compressing the workload; it’s not unlocking brand new capabilities. But I would argue that compressing workload, especially at that scale, is pretty transformative.\n\nNow, if we’re to claim that BindCraft results are, at the end of the day, no better than simply doing phage display, then, yes, I can see that. But some recent work from earlier this year suggests that these models can also design binders for receptors that are  traditionally  very hard to design against — like GPCRs, which phage display struggles with. None of these approaches is  a silver bullet, but it does feel like we’re getting close!\n\nClara: I feel like there’s an archetype in this discourse: the crotchety computational biologist who has seen it all before and is very skeptical of the potential of these machine learning tools to make a difference in developing new, viable treatments, either because the technology itself isn’t good enough or because there are too many other bottlenecks. I know and respect a lot of these people! But I also know and respect many others who are incredibly excited. I’m trying clarify what heuristics I should be paying attention to when evaluating how people talk about these technologies.\n\nAbhi: Obviously, take my opinion with a grain of salt. The big reason I wanted to work at a company that is closer to clinical stage machine learning is that, ultimately, most of the problems with drug development relate to the clinical stage. It is very rare that we don't have enough interesting ideas at the very beginning. Rather, the problem is that testing each one of those ideas is enormously expensive. If your goal is to make drug discovery better, you can do one of two things. You can either improve the physical shot itself to begin with — by creating new and unique binders,  like BindCraft —  or you can improve your ability to shoot in the first place. I see clinical stage companies as very focused on the latter, which I think is of much higher importance.\n\nSo why isn't everyone trying to improve how well they can shoot? The answer is that no one really knows how to do it well; it’s a much harder problem. For example, Noetik, the company I work at now, has taken a bet on patient stratification being something that's deeply underappreciated in oncology. We have models that understand tumor microenvironments better than humans do, so we’re using those models to improve patient stratification. The current cancer drug failure rate is 95%; if we can drop that down to 70%, we’ve made it far more economical for pharmaceutical companies to throw far more shots. That’s success to me.\n\nClara: What are some concrete examples of clinical companies that are doing clinical stage work, in addition to Noetik? What does that look like in practice?\n\nAbhi: The most salient example I can think of is a startup called Unlearn.AI. They sell a purely computational platform that conducts synthetic control trials; essentially, they’re saying:  “We’ve run many patients with Alzheimer’s through controlled trials before. Do we really need to run one again? Or, can we use the hundreds of trials that have been run previously to create a synthetic version of the controlled trial population you would otherwise be creating?” They are selling that as a service. That’s an example of a clinical stage company.\n\nClara: How much data would you need for something like that to be feasible?\n\nAbhi: This is why most people don't do it — you need a lot of data points. Most worryingly of all, you need human data points, which are the hardest data points to gather. I think  the reason that there aren’t that many clinical stage machine learning biology companies is because it's such a capital intensive effort, and the people who have the legible pedigree necessary to raise for such a thesis are usually more curious about the preclinical stage stuff because it's more intellectually satisfying.\n\nClara: So, for companies that want to do clinical stage work, do they always need to collect all of the data themselves? If the whole draw is that an enormous number of Alzheimer's trials have already happened, how easy is it to actually collect all that  data from those trials and synthesize it? Do those trials even have all of the data points that you would need for a synthetic trial?\n\nAbhi: Moving away from Unlearn.AI —  because I don't know their data collection strategy — the historical issue with collecting data from prior clinical trials is that it’s really hard. Maybe the people behind the trial did collect some raw biological material from your sample of interest — for cancer that's a tumor resection, for inflammatory bowel disease that's an intestinal lesion —  but they usually care about one or two specific biomarkers, and that's all they extracted. The  sample itself may have since been discarded. Or, maybe, they stored the biological material, but it’s logistically complicated to access; , there isn’t exactly a marketplace for this.\n\nThere is a company I mention in my recent post, Artera AI, which got FDA approval for a black box biomarker that can stratify patients based on whether they will or will not respond to an anti-androgen therapy for prostate cancer. They developed that model based entirely on retrospective specimens from previous Phase 3 prostate cancer trials run by other companies. I know very little about the logistical nightmare of getting  those samples, but I imagine it was intense. The moat in creating models like this is being able to transact with many different companies at once, all of whom don't really want to share their data with you.\n\nClara: What are the class of problems that you think these models are good for, that the current system is doing a bad job addressing?\n\nAbhi: I would vaguely gesture at human simulation — can we predict which patients will respond to a particular drug? It’s obviously a very narrow slice of human simulation. But for all problems where you need to drug a human and observe whatever happens to them, there is some model that claims to model exactly that behavior such that you don't need the human at all. For example, Alzheimer's clinical trials can take decades  to reach their primary endpoint. But maybe there is some biomarker, which is not human legible, that could be gleaned from the patient data, say, a few months in. So there are companies popping up that claim that they can  create prognostic biomarkers during the course of a clinical trial, which they will then sell to other companies.\n\nClara: So it's a way of making the process of figuring out which drugs you should test in humans more efficient.\n\nAbhi: Yes, I would argue that this is the claim of most clinical stage machine learning companies.\n\nClara: This is central to the problem that people who are worried about drug R&D efficiency are concerned about — that actual clinical trials are too slow and too expensive.\n\nAbhi: They feel closely aligned. I know Jack [Scannell] is a historic skeptic of a lot of machine learning biology companies, and I would agree that what I've said so far is the story that has been sold. It feels very logical to me that, at some point, it will bear fruit. It is not obviously true that any of it has borne fruit yet.\n\nBut you can look at the mountain of papers that are published after clinical trials. A cancer trial goes on, ends up failing, and then there's a paper that comes out afterward that tries to figure out why. Usually, some small fraction of patients have responded to the drug, and the paper is trying to understand this. It’s always a complicated answer — maybe a particular cytokine group was super upregulated in the responder group and all of them are white males in their 30s. Useful insights rarely come out of this work, but you can see the inklings of a computational system that could predict all of this in advance. None of it is truly outside the bounds of knowledge. It is compressible; we just don't know how to compress it.\n\nGoing back to the question of how do you know whether you have enough data? I don't think anyone knows,  for any machine learning problem, how much data is enough. You just need to test it out and see what happens. That's an unsatisfying answer, but the realistic situation we're in is that the alternative is having no computational way to simulate a human at all, which is where we are today. I would argue that's worse.\n\nClara: What are the data sets that you most wish you had?\n\nAbhi: The gold standard in my head is whole proteome spatial proteomics. That is a type of data set that I don't think is possible to create today — if it is, it would cost a massive amount of money. This is very specific to cancer, but it would be the ability to take a tumor biopsy and visualize every single human protein that exists within the spatial context of the system. It's almost like an X by Y by 20,000 image of what is going on inside a tumor. Maybe even more than 20,000 if we’re considering isoforms. If I were to add more, I would like multiple biopsies from the same tumor, because within a tumor there exist multitudes.\n\nClara: Why is this impossible to get now?\n\nAbhi: My impression is that it is just incredibly expensive to generate the data; even if you could generate it, you could not do so at sufficient scale to  actually make sense of it. To be clear,  when I say spatial proteomics data would be useful for me, I am not saying it would be useful to me as a human with a human brain. It would be very useful for a model to ingest.\n\nClara: You've written a lot about why you think that cancer is an especially exciting field for machine learning applications; because there are so many different genes and interactions involved, it does not lend itself to a human manually figuring out a target.\n\nAbhi: I'm not sure I would go so far as to say cancer as a field is uniquely suited to machine learning. I would say that I work in cancer because it is a field where the emotional impact is quite high. Cancer is a terrifying disease. The truth is that if you solve cancer, in absolute numbers you don't actually improve human lifespan by all that much — something else gets you in the end. But dying from cancer is such a uniquely horrifying experience that it feels like a worthy life goal to spend at least a few years working on it.\n\nAs a field, cancer is nice because it  has had so much money infused into it. And rightly so, because it is a disease that affects a lot of people. This  has led to the realization  that the disease is so complicated that you need very smart academic oncologists to look over individual patients and recommend treatments, creating a  prebuilt culture of personalized medicine. Outside of oncology, and perhaps autoimmune disease, I don't think any other disease is given the same level of respect with regards to how extremely complicated it can be to treat.\n\nThere is also a lot of unmet need in cancer, and people are willing to accept big swings. In Type 2 diabetes, there's not a ton of unmet need — GLP-1s solve a significant fraction, as do insulin and metformin. But for pancreatic cancer, where everyone who gets the  diagnosis has a high chance of dying in the next six months, there's a strong argument to make that you can try crazier things. It feels like a natural fit for machine learning to play a role.\n\nClara: There’s more cultural willingness to experiment there.\n\nAbhi: Yes, that’s a better way of encapsulating it..\n\nClara: Do you think the structure of the problem biologically lends itself better to computational methods, or do you think it's just a factor of \"people really freaking want to cure cancer\"?\n\nAbhi: I think the second point is definitely the highest order bit. When I wrote the article you mentioned, many people made very valid points that cancer is certainly not alone in being an extremely complicated disease with a lot of patient heterogeneity — there’s inflammatory bowel disease, endometriosis.\n\nThe human body is complicated. Every disease is complicated. The flu is complicated. HIV is complicated. It would be hard to drive a stake in the sand and say this is more complicated than that. The only people who do that are people who want funding for their disease area. This is hand wavy, but a better way of conceptualizing whether a disease is hard or easy to cure is: how many \"knobs\" does biology give you access to for controlling that condition?\n\nIt turns out that for bacterial infections, you get this very nice set of knobs: foreign invaders have a completely different set of biology that you can uniquely interact with. The way at least a few antibiotics work is by jamming up cellular machinery that only exists in bacteria. On the other end of the spectrum, cancer has no unique cellular machinery and is largely identical to you. There are aspects of cancer that are unique, such as  its metabolism, but cancer also grows very fast so it can quickly evolve beyond whatever unique aspect it has. There is no knob that it gives you access to that it is not willing to evolve away from.\n\nHIV gives you a very nice knob in the sense that it's easy to jam up its ability to infect cells, but it doesn't give you access to the knob that allows it to sequester itself into cells for decades. That's why you can have chronic HIV — it doesn't do anything to you, but it just lives in your body because there's no lever you can pull to get it removed from every one of your cells.\n\nThe thesis of another article I'm writing is: If you look at all the crazy drugs that have come out — PrEP, CRISPR, CAR-T — they are all fundamentally reliant on taking advantage of existing biology that was already there. CRISPR is based on a bacterial immune system. CAR-T is based on reconfiguring existing T-cell receptors. The vast majority of medicines rely on conserved evolutionary biology. I would argue that a disease is harder or easier to cure depending on how many of those knobs are made available to you.\n\nClara: Where do you see this field in five years? Which things that people are doing now are going to yield real results?\n\nAbhi: I think those who are focusing on clinical stage stuff will be deemed particularly prescient. Right now, when I look out at the field, a lot of the companies starting up are clinical stage machine learning biology companies. People are realizing we don't need better preclinical research; we need to shift our aims to the clinical stage.\n\nThis is low conviction, but I think the focus on human data will grow larger and larger. People will be more willing to let go of the perfect ability to perturb everything in their system in exchange for working with human data.\n\nThere’s also something about temporality I’m curious about. I've written about Recursion Pharmaceuticals before. Since their founding, they have used this particular assay called \"cell painting\" to visualize things — applying dyes that bind to DNA (blue light) or cell membranes (red light). I wrote about a change they made recently where they dropped that entire assay. Now they are taking raw, “bright-field” images — literally shining a bright light on the cell and looking at it through a microscope.\n\nThey’re doing this because they noticed it made no difference to their models. Models are getting really good; they don't need human legible color labels. More interestingly, the application of those dyes usually required killing the cell first (“fixing it”). If you're just imaging the cells with light, you gain access to a temporal dimension where you can see how the cells react from hour to hour, from day to day, from week to week. There's a multibillion-dollar company generating petabytes of this sort of data month after month. I don't know what they'll do with it, but it feels to me like there is unique biology there that has never been explored.\n\nClara: If you're excited about clinical stage machine learning and the bottleneck is data, what could people be working on to resolve that  bottleneck?\n\nAbhi: Starting a company which generates that same sort of data but cheaply and better than everyone else. I think there is a lot of value in tool or service companies that take existing assays and make them much easier to run at scale.\n\nHave you heard of a company called Plasmidsaurus? I've written about them too. They are very famous in the biology world. All they do is sequence plasmids —  genetic material that you can shove into new cells. Traditionally, creating plasmids is an error prone process, so labs use error prone plasmids and the outcome of that research is pure garbage. This company popped up four or five years ago, and their claim is this: Send us your plasmids. We will sequence them for $15, make sure they're absolutely correct, and send you back the information.\n\nIt's an astronomical success story. I think they started with $100k in seed funding, and now it's a $40 million annual recurring revenue business. They took an existing workflow and rapidly automated it.\n\nClara: Wow. Why aren't there more companies like this?\n\nAbhi: It’s an interesting story. Plasmidsaurus primarily sequences via Nanopore sequencers, which are super cheap to run. Nanopore sequencing came out around 2010-2015. Oxford Nanopore, the company behind it, was filled with great scientific minds, but was terrible at teaching people how to use their machines. So, for a brief time, there was an arbitrage period where people who really understood how to use this machine could charge to run it for other people who had no idea how to work with it. The founder of Plasmidsaurus, Mark, was doing a postdoc at Caltech where he was running Nanopore sequencing all day. He knew better than almost anyone else on earth how to work with these sequencers and even worked with the company to establish good protocols. He just used his knowledge, performed that workflow for other people, and scaled it up.\n\nClara: Are there other areas like this, where a Mark could step in and make the whole process more efficient?\n\nAbhi: I think in an ideal world, more people would start up something in high-throughput proteomics. There’s Olink, there’s Nautilus Biotech. It’s just that you need a very specific skill set to build a company like that, and not many of those people are interested in starting a company. This is why I'm very happy that Focused Research Organization enthusiasts, like Convergent Research, have taken a strong dip into funding measurement companies. It’s a hard thing to make a business out of, but if they do their job well, it pays off civilizational dividends.\n\nClara: Didn’t FROs get started because Adam Marblestone was really interested in connectomics? He wanted that data set.\n\nAbhi: And now there’s E11 Bio. I think Adam has incredible taste in the types of companies that are best suited to funding via the FRO mechanism.\n\nClara: Why is it so difficult to build a data measurement company, then, if there's obviously a market?\n\nAbhi: There are distinct steps in the biology data life cycle. At the very beginning, there is raw academic research. You see that, for example, some particular biological interaction occurs when two peptides interlock together and one lights up. That's the true measurement signal. The second step is turning that into a company where you go out and say, “I can measure XYZ for you at scale.” That's where people get stuck, because for a lot of interesting data modalities, there's no clear market that exists in advance.\n\nFor example, Nautilus Biotech has  a bizarrely good biology podcast. In some episodes they ask, \"What is the utility of our high-throughput proteomics platform?\" And the answer they give is pretty honest: \"We’re still figuring it out, but here are some ideas.\" There isn't a clear use case for it today, but they argue that's because this type of data has not existed before. If you give a scientist a huge amount of proteomics data, all the way to the isoform level, they won't know what to make of it for at least the first year. It takes time for the field to catch up culturally.\n\nClara: So it’s a chicken and egg thing. The data could theoretically be useful, but it's hard to get the data because nobody supplies it, and nobody supplies it because there are no buyers, because people don't know what to do with it yet.\n\nAbhi: Exactly. I talked to someone at E11 Bio about this, with regards to connectomics. I asked, \"Why do connectomics? What do you get from this?\" They said, \"We don't know. No one has measured this before. We know it was kind of useful for a fruit fly brain, but we don't know if it's going to be useful for anything larger. But no one else is going to do it.\"\n\nClara: What is your opinion on Dario Amodei-style claims — that LLM-based architectures will be doing scientific ideation and this will have major impacts on the world?\n\nAbhi: I think it's directionally true in verifiable domains where these models have already demonstrated superhuman reasoning. For any strong AI scientist claim to be true, it is almost implicitly saying that humans are bad at building connections between the existing set of data. I think that is true. I don't think it's so true that we would naturally expect brand new fields to pop up overnight from an AI. I struggle to look at what Dario says and say, \"That's clearly incorrect,\" but I do think humans are actually really good at extracting useful insights from scientific data. We have hundreds of thousands of postdocs and PhD students poring over the literature. They come up with a lot of really crazy things.\n\nTo steelman this: I recently interviewed Ellen Zhong. Her research is about how to interpret cryo-EM particle images better. She developed a deep learning method to do this. Afterward, she went back to existing cryo-EM data that had been measured in the literature using classical methods, applied her method, and saw that she was able to extract proteins that they did not even think existed in the dataset. That is a case where an \"in silico Ellen Zhong\" would be able to measure things humans did not see. But cryo-EM in some sense is a verifiable field; there is a genuine ground truth. I think in biology generally, there are not a lot of verifiable ground truths.\n\nAbhishaike Mahajan has spent his career trying to use computation to improve human health.

    "fullText": "Seamus Culleton, who has lived in US for two decades, faces deportation after being arrested on way home from work\n\nUS politics live – latest updates\n\nAn Irish man has spent five months in US Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention and faces deportation despite having a valid work permit and no criminal record.\n\nSeamus Culleton was a “model immigrant” who had become the victim of a capricious and inept system, said his lawyer, Ogor Winnie Okoye.\n\nOriginally from County Kilkenny, Culleton has lived in the US for more than 20 years, is married to a US citizen and runs a plastering business in the Boston area. On his way home from work on 9 September 2025 he was arrested in a random immigration sweep, according to Okoye, of BOS Legal Group in Massachusetts.\n\nAfter being held in ICE facilities near Boston and in Buffalo, New York, he was flown to a facility in El Paso, Texas, where he is sharing a cell with more than 70 men. Culleton said the detention centre was cold, damp and squalid and there were fights over insufficient food – “like a concentration camp, absolute hell”, he told the Irish Times, which first reported the story on Monday.\n\nCulleton said that when he was arrested he was carrying a Massachusetts driving licence and a valid work permit issued as part of an application for a green card that he initiated in April 2025. He has a final interview remaining.\n\nWhen asked at the Buffalo facility to sign a form agreeing to deportation, Culleton said he refused and instead ticked a box expressing a wish to contest his arrest, which he intended to do on the grounds that he was married to a US citizen, Tiffany Smyth, and had a valid work permit.\n\nAt a November hearing a judge approved his release on a $4,000 bond, which Smyth paid, but authorities continued to detain Culleton, initially without explanation.\n\nWhen his attorney appealed to a federal court, two ICE agents said that in Buffalo Culleton had signed documents agreeing to be deported. Culleton said he did not agree and that the signatures were not his. “My whole life is here. I worked so hard to build my business. My wife is here.”\n\nThe judge noted irregularities in ICE’s court documents but sided with the agency. Under US law Culleton cannot appeal but he wants handwriting experts to examine the signatures and believes a video of his interview with ICE in Buffalo would prove he refused to sign deportation documents.\n\nPrevious high-profile cases involving people from Ireland include Cliona Ward, who had a green card but was detained by ICE for 17 days over a criminal record from more than 20 years ago. A visiting Irish tech worker who overstayed his visa by three days and agreed to deportation was jailed for about 100 days.\n\nCulleton told the Irish Times he did not know what would happen next and that the uncertainty was “psychological torture”. Facility officials tried to get him to sign a deportation order last week but he refused, he said.\n\nOkoye said the US government had discretionary power to release her client and was acting in an inept and capricious manner towards an immigrant who was following the green card process. “Here’s a gentleman who is a model immigrant. He owned a successful business, he’s married to a US citizen.”\n\nSmyth said she had endured five months of heartbreak, stress, anxiety and anger. “I would never wish this on anyone or their family. I am still praying for a miracle every day.”\n\nAfter a video call with her husband on Sunday night – their first in five months – Smyth told Culleton’s family in Ireland he had lost weight and hair and had sores and infections. “There’s no hygiene there. He’s been asking for antibiotics for the last four weeks,” his sister, Caroline Culleton, told RTÉ. The detainees were seldom allowed out for exercise or air, she said.\n\n“It’s heartbreaking. We’ve talked about what he endures physically but what about his mental health? How will he deal with this when he gets out? What long-term effect it has on him?”\n\nLast week the Irish government said the number of Irish citizens seeking consular assistance about deportation from the US jumped from 15 in 2024 to 65 last year, a 330% increase.",

    "title": "Does Higher VO₂ Max Make You More Attractive?",
    "description": "Cardiovascular fitness changes your nervous system, your skin, your energy, and the way you show up in a room. The research on why fitter people seem more magnetic has less to do with appearance than you'd think.",
    "fullText": "A friend said something to me recently that I haven't been able to stop thinking about. We were talking about someone we both knew who had started running consistently about a year ago. She said, \"He just seems different now. More present. Calmer. I don't know—more attractive?\"\n\nShe couldn't put her finger on what had changed. It wasn't that he'd lost a dramatic amount of weight or suddenly developed a model's jawline. Something more subtle had shifted. The way he carried himself. The steadiness in conversation. A kind of groundedness that wasn't there before.\n\nI've noticed this pattern in myself, too. After months of consistent training, the changes that people comment on aren't the ones I expected. It's not \"you look more muscular\" or \"have you lost weight?\" It's \"you seem more relaxed\" or \"you have more energy.\" These are vague compliments, but they point at something specific—a shift in baseline physiological state that other people can apparently detect, even if they can't name it.\n\nSo I started wondering: is there actual science behind this? Does cardiovascular fitness change something about how you're perceived by others—not through appearance, but through the deeper signals your body sends?\n\nHere's what I think is the most underappreciated consequence of improving your VO₂ max: it doesn't just change your cardiovascular system. It rewires your autonomic nervous system—the part of you that governs how calm or reactive you are at any given moment.\n\nYour autonomic nervous system has two main branches. The sympathetic branch handles fight-or-flight. The parasympathetic branch handles rest-and-digest. The balance between them determines your baseline state: are you walking through your day slightly on edge, or are you walking through it relatively settled?\n\nCardiovascular fitness directly strengthens parasympathetic tone. The mechanism is the vagus nerve—a long cranial nerve that runs from your brainstem to your gut, connecting your brain to your heart, lungs, and digestive system along the way. Higher vagal tone means your body is better at downshifting after stress. Your resting heart rate drops. Your heart rate variability increases. You recover from tense moments faster.\n\nA systematic review in Frontiers in Psychology found that higher heart rate variability—a direct marker of vagal tone—is associated with better emotional regulation, more adaptive coping strategies, and greater acceptance of emotions. People with higher HRV were better at downregulating negative emotional responses and handling social uncertainty.\n\nThis matters for how others perceive you because nervous system state isn't invisible. It leaks. It shows up in your breathing rate, your vocal steadiness, the tension in your shoulders, how quickly you react when someone says something unexpected. Research on HRV and social behavior suggests that parasympathetic regulation is linked not just to internal calm, but to outward prosocial behavior—empathy, attunement, the capacity to stay present during difficult conversations.\n\nA study in Psychophysiology found that individuals with higher resting HRV had better affective interaction quality during naturally occurring social interactions. They were also less aggressive, showed more accurate emotion recognition, and demonstrated more flexible emotional responses. Their interaction partners reported more positive experiences.\n\nNone of this is about looking a certain way. It's about the physiological foundation beneath your social presence. And cardiovascular fitness is one of the most reliable ways to build it.\n\nThere's a more visible channel, too—one I didn't take seriously until I read the research.\n\nA 2015 study from McMaster University published in Aging Cell found something striking: regular aerobic exercise doesn't just slow skin aging—it can actually reverse it. Researchers examined skin samples from sedentary adults over 65 who then completed a three-month exercise program. After the intervention, their skin's outer and inner layers resembled those of people decades younger. The researchers identified a muscle-derived protein called IL-15 that increases with exercise and appears to enhance mitochondrial function in skin cells.\n\nA 2023 study in Scientific Reports extended this, showing that both aerobic and resistance training significantly improved skin elasticity and dermal structure in sedentary middle-aged women over 16 weeks. The improvements were driven by changes in circulating inflammatory markers and increased expression of collagen-related genes.\n\nA narrative review in JMIR Dermatology synthesized the evidence: regular exercise increases blood flow to the skin, improves moisture retention, elevates skin temperature, and promotes structural changes that are associated with a more youthful appearance.\n\nThis isn't about vanity metrics. Skin quality is one of the most reliable nonverbal signals of overall health—something humans have evolved to notice, even unconsciously. You don't consciously evaluate someone's dermal collagen density when you meet them. But you register something. Their face looks rested. Their skin has a certain vitality. It reads as health, which reads as something adjacent to attractiveness.\n\nThere's another channel that's harder to measure but easy to feel: energy.\n\nNot the manic, caffeinated kind. The kind where someone seems genuinely present in a conversation, not visibly running on fumes. The kind where someone suggests walking to the next place instead of grabbing a cab, not because they're performatively athletic, but because they have the capacity to spare.\n\nCardiovascular fitness determines how much of your total physical capacity everyday life consumes. A 40-year-old with a VO₂ max of 45 uses a smaller fraction of their aerobic reserve to climb stairs, carry groceries, or walk across a parking lot than someone at 32. The physiological headroom is larger. Daily tasks cost less. What's left over shows up as available energy—for conversation, for engagement, for showing up fully rather than managing fatigue.\n\nThis connects to something I wrote about in the psychology of hard intervals: perceived exertion isn't just about exercise. Your brain's effort-monitoring system operates all day, weighing the cost of every action against your available resources. When your cardiovascular system is more efficient, the cost estimate for everyday physical tasks drops. You move through the world with less internal friction. That lower friction is perceptible to others, even if they'd never describe it in those terms.\n\nI wrote previously about how cardiovascular fitness affects mental health, and one piece of that research keeps coming back to me in this context.\n\nThe cross-stressor adaptation hypothesis suggests that repeatedly challenging your body with exercise trains your stress response to be more resilient against all forms of stress—not just physical. A randomized controlled trial found that 12 weeks of endurance training significantly reduced cortisol reactivity and heart rate responses during a psychosocial stress test. The exercise group literally became less physiologically reactive to social stress.\n\nThink about what that means in everyday life. The person who doesn't flinch when a meeting goes sideways. The friend who stays steady when everyone else is spiraling. The partner who can absorb bad news without immediately escalating. These aren't personality traits. They're partly expressions of autonomic regulation—the same system that cardiovascular fitness directly strengthens.\n\nI'm not claiming that a high VO₂ max makes someone charismatic. Charisma is complex, and personality matters enormously. But I am suggesting that the physiological calm that comes with better cardiovascular fitness creates a foundation for the kind of social presence people find appealing—steadiness, warmth, emotional availability, the ability to stay regulated when things get uncomfortable.\n\nI want to be precise about what the research supports and what it doesn't.\n\nThere's no study I've found that directly measures VO₂ max against rated attractiveness in a controlled setting. The connections I'm drawing are indirect: cardiovascular fitness improves vagal tone, which improves emotional regulation and social interaction quality. It improves skin health through measurable biological pathways. It increases available energy and reduces stress reactivity. These are all things that plausibly influence how someone is perceived.\n\nBut \"plausibly\" isn't \"proven.\" Correlation isn't causation, and self-selection is a real confound. People who exercise regularly may also sleep better, eat better, and have more structured lives—any of which could independently affect how they show up socially. The exercise itself may not be the sole driver.\n\nWhat I find compelling is that the mechanisms are specific and well-documented. We're not talking about vague \"exercise makes you feel good\" claims. We're talking about measurable changes in vagal tone, HRV, cortisol reactivity, skin structure, and energy availability—each supported by peer-reviewed research. The chain from fitness to physiology to social perception has real links, even if the full chain hasn't been tested end-to-end.\n\nI used to think about my training almost entirely in terms of numbers. VO₂ max. Heart rate zones. Benchmarks for my age. The longevity data. These are all real and motivating.\n\nBut the thing that actually keeps me training consistently isn't the number on my watch. It's how I feel in a room full of people. It's the fact that I'm less reactive to stress, more patient in conversations, and carrying less background tension through my day. It's the compound effect of a calmer nervous system, better sleep, and the quiet confidence that comes from knowing your body works well.\n\nWhether that makes me \"more attractive\" in any measurable sense, I genuinely don't know. But it makes me more available—to friends, to work, to the small daily interactions that make up a life. And I suspect that availability, that physiological presence, is what people are actually responding to when they say someone seems different after getting fit.\n\nThe changes that matter most aren't the ones you can see in a mirror. They're the ones other people feel when they're around you.\n\nTrack how your cardiovascular fitness is changing over time with VO2 Max Pro.

A few months ago, I decided to breathe new life into a 2019 Dell XPS 15 that had been collecting dust for a couple of years.\n\nDespite its (at the time) high-end Core i7 CPU and 32GB of RAM, Windows was frustratingly slow on it. The fan was constantly at full throttle even when the machine was idle, and it regularly failed to install updates. So in early 2024, I gave up and switched to an M1 MacBook Pro.\n\nBut I wanted to give my oldest child something to practice typing on. Plus, I’d been trying to find a suitable distraction-free writing solution. (Spoiler: this laptop was not the solution I was looking for.) So I installed Ubuntu. Again.\n\nSee, before the MacBook and before the Dell XPS, I was a Linux user. I first installed Ubuntu in 2006 on a ThinkPad X40. And it remained my primary OS across three different laptops and 13 years.\n\nDespite some... let’s call them quirks (Wi-Fi didn’t work out of the box on that X40), I was happy with Linux for a long time. I dual-booted Windows out of necessity, and often had a work-issued MacBook on hand. But those were for testing apps or specific tasks, like editing video. 99 percent of my life was spent in Ubuntu.\n\nThat is, until about 2017. As I got older, tinkering with my laptop changed from a hobby to something that got in the way of me pursuing my other hobbies. I had rediscovered my love of making music, and, try as it might, Ubuntu Studio just wasn’t cutting it. I was spending more time in Ableton Live, which meant more time in Windows, until in 2019, I bought the aforementioned XPS and switched over completely.\n\nA lot has changed in the 20 years since I first installed Linux, and even in the seven years since I last used it. It’s now arguably the best platform for PC gaming. There are genuinely great photo-editing apps, such as Darktable, which was introduced in 2009. And there are even viable, commercial options for making music in Bitwig and Reaper, all of which have improved dramatically since 2019.\n\nThe Ubuntu installation process hasn’t changed much, but the interface is prettier. I put the ISO on a thumb drive and briefly considered wiping the XPS completely. I chickened out at the last minute and decided to dual-boot, which meant repartitioning my hard drive.\n\nRight off the bat, I was reminded that Linux hasn’t completely overcome its fiddly nature. The fingerprint reader didn’t work. A minor annoyance I decided to ignore.\n\nMore concerning was that Ubuntu failed to install updates because of an EFI partition issue specific to the XPS 15 that was also causing problems under Windows. I managed to get them installed, but I’m not convinced I didn’t create a ticking time bomb by deleting essential files.\n\nUbuntu also refused to mount my Windows partition for the first month or so, before suddenly working for unknown reasons. Stevie similarly admitted to “rage quitting and going to bed” when they couldn’t get Ubuntu to connect to a second SSD.\n\nNathan had his own bizarre problems where his CachyOS refused to acknowledge his mouse clicks. He was also hit with option paralysis, trying to choose between four bootloaders and 13 desktop environments. For some, this is part of the appeal, the infinite customizability, the power to bend your computer to your every whim and make it truly yours. Ubuntu doesn’t throw its customizability in your face, the way Cachy does, but it’s still there if you want it.\n\nThe problem, as I encountered during my days of meticulously tweaking desktops and crafting my dream note-taking tool using Obsidian, is that you’re building a house of cards. One tiny thing in some seemingly inconsequential library or plug-in could cause the whole system to come crumbling down. I don’t want to be wasting my time tweaking and troubleshooting when I already have things that work.\n\nEven if you keep it simple, as I did on my XPS, you’re hardly guaranteed smooth sailing. Ubuntu is one of the best-supported Linux distros. And, while my specific XPS 15 isn’t one of them, Dell has sold many Ubuntu-certified laptops over the years, so I figured I was in the clear — wrong.\n\nSeveral apps, whether from the official Ubuntu App Center, downloaded snaps, or .deb packages, quietly failed to install. No obvious error, no nothing. I had to open the terminal and install them from there to see what went wrong. Installing software on Linux is somehow even more confusing than it was 20 years ago.\n\nEven the things that worked weren’t seamless. I got Steam up and running, but it took hours, required installing outdated 32-bit libraries, and it crashed along the way. Oh, and Steam games refused to recognize my audio interface; they would only play through the laptop’s speakers. CachyOS or Bazzite would have provided a smoother Steam experience. But it’s also illustrative of the problem. Saying you use Linux is almost meaningless because there are so many different flavors.\n\nThankfully, Bitwig recognized my audio interface, but it was fickle about which MIDI controllers it wanted to work with (an issue I’d never had on the Mac version), and crashed when I first tried to run it. Also, while the native Bitwig instruments are solid, I missed my favorite soft synths and effects, like Arturia’s Pigments, which is Windows- and Mac-only.\n\nThere were a handful of other minor annoyances. If my laptop went to sleep (which it only seems to do when it’s plugged in, go figure), it refused to reconnect to the external hard drive I have hooked up, and it stopped recognizing the SD card reader. To get them working again, I have to reboot. It also doesn’t wake on input from a Bluetooth mouse or keyboard. I have to open the lid to wake it when it’s hooked up to my dock and an external monitor.\n\nIf I just need a web browser, Ubuntu works like a charm. I had no issues with my Wi-Fi or with Firefox. My XPS now runs faster and quieter than it did with Windows. And I got Obsidian up and running with minimal fuss. I used Ubuntu as my primary work machine for a few days, and everything was fine. But I can do most of my job from the confines of a web browser.\n\nIt’s everything else. I can game on my Linux machine, but the experience is smoother on my Switch or PS4. I can make music in Bitwig or Reaper on Ubuntu, but Ableton on macOS is easier to use and supports all my VSTs. GIMP and Darktable offer solid image editing, but let’s be honest, they’re nowhere near as powerful as Lightroom and Photoshop. Linux can do all the things now — sometimes better than Windows. But for all it does, it always feels like there’s a better option.",

    "fullText": "Following the U.S. operation that led to the removal of Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro at the start of January, President Donald Trump has made repeated threats on the Caribbean island nation of Cuba.\n\nAfter calling the country \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security, the Trump administration has blocked all Cuban oil supplies and threatened to impose tariffs on any country that provides them.\n\nWith the main supply cut off following Maduro's removal, the Cuban government warned that the country is close to running out of oil in a way that will disrupt any airlines trying to land there for refueling stops. For a month beginning Feb. 9, Cuba is suspending oil supplies to foreign airlines to address the energy crisis, CNBC reported.\n\nThis means airlines including American Airlines, Air Canada, and Air France, which run multiple flights into the country, will need to either carry enough backup jet fuel or arrange for refueling stops in nearby Caribbean countries such as the Dominican Republic or Jamaica.\n\nThe move affects both the central Havana Jose Marti International Airport (HAV) and smaller airports in Cuban cities including Varadero, Holguín, Manzanillo, and Santa Clara.\n\nWhile Mexico had previously attempted to boost oil supplies to Cuba, the threat of tariffs has led to it pulling back. The humanitarian situation, reported by Reuters, has reached critical levels, where many portions of the country are left without power.\n\nCanadian national airline Air Canada has made major cutbacks of its Cuba service and has run primarily non-revenue flights out of the country to get stranded travelers back home.\n\nAir France has confirmed to French news service AFP that it will reroute its refueling stops to other countries in the Caribbean.\n\n\"We will operate as scheduled out of Cuba, carrying passengers to Canada,\" an Air Canada airline representative said in a statement. \"We continue to monitor the situation to ensure safe and reliable operations for our passengers and crew and will share more information as it becomes available.\"\n\nAmerican Airlines, which at this time of the year runs more than 70 weekly flights to Cuban cities like Havana and Holguín from Miami International (MIA), is another airline that could see significant disruption by the Cuban NOTAM that prevents foreign carrier refueling.\n\nAirline to launch unusual new flight to Cayman Islands from the U.S.\n\nUnited Airlines CEO gives stark warning on Olympic Games\n\nUnexpected country is most luxurious travel destination for 2026\n\nUS government issues sudden warning on Switzerland travel",

    "fullText": "LONDON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Britain's Prince William and his wife Kate said on Monday they were deeply concerned by revelations in the Jeffrey Epstein files amid further damning disclosures about the heir-to-the-throne's uncle, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.\n\nThe younger brother of ​King Charles, already cast out of the royal inner circle over his close relationship with Epstein, has faced fresh ‌scrutiny since the recent publication of millions of new documents relating to the late convicted U.S. sex offender.\n\nWhile Charles and his wife Camilla said in October that their ‌thoughts and sympathies were with the victims and survivors of abuse, Monday's comment by the Prince and Princess of Wales was the most pointed message so far from the royal family on the scandal.\n\n\"The prince and princess have been deeply concerned by the continuing revelations,\" their spokesperson told reporters ahead of the prince's arrival on a high-profile trip to Saudi Arabia. \"Their thoughts remain focused on the victims.\"\n\nANDREW AND EPSTEIN AN EMBARRASSMENT ⁠FOR KING AND ROYALS\n\nMountbatten-Windsor was forced to quit ‌all official royal duties in 2019 over his ties with Epstein and, in October, King Charles removed his title of prince. Last week, he was forced to move out of his royal mansion.\n\nIn 2022, he ‍settled a lawsuit brought by Virginia Giuffre which accused him of sexually abusing her when she was a teenager, through her association with Epstein. Giuffre died by suicide last April.\n\nThe 65-year-old second son of the late Queen Elizabeth has always denied any wrongdoing and has not responded to requests for ​comment since the latest release of Epstein files.\n\nWhile the royal family have attempted to distance themselves from Mountbatten-Windsor, he remains a thorn ‌in their side.\n\n\"Charles, how long have you known about Andrew and Epstein?\" a man shouted from the crowd as the king arrived in Clitheroe, northern England, the second time he had been heckled in a week.\n\nIn the latest files released in the U.S., emails suggest he shared official British trade documents with Epstein in 2010, after Epstein's conviction for child sex crimes, leaking information from his then-official role as a government envoy.\n\nThe documents appear to show that Andrew forwarded Epstein reports about Vietnam, Singapore and other places that he had ⁠been sent in relation to an official trip.\n\nTrade envoys are usually barred from ​sharing sensitive or commercial documents.\n\nPOLICE ASSESS ANDREW OVER POSSIBLE DISCLOSURES TO EPSTEIN\n\nThames Valley ​Police said the issue had been reported to them and that they were assessing whether to formally investigate, \"in line with our established procedures\".\n\nLast week, police said they were reviewing a new allegation against Andrew, triggered by the ‍latest files, involving a woman being ⁠taken to an address in Windsor near London, where he has lived on the royal estate.\n\nOver the last 10 days, revelations from the files have also engulfed Prime Minister Keir Starmer in what is widely viewed as the biggest crisis of ⁠his premiership for having appointed Peter Mandelson, an acquaintance of Epstein, as ambassador to the U.S.\n\nLike Andrew, it appears that Mandelson also shared sensitive government files from ‌2009 and 2010 with Epstein, and police are investigating claims of misconduct in public office.",

    "fullText": "More than 800 US retail stores and restaurants are set to close by the end of 2026.\n\nMajor chains, including Wendy's and Macy's, are citing efficiency as the reason behind the closures.\n\nPizza Hut is one of the latest companies to announce closures.\n\nRetailers and restaurants are gearing up for another wave of store closures.\n\nIt's shaping up to be the continuation of a retail pullback that Business Insider tracked in 2024 and 2025. Major chains, from department store Macy's to restaurant chains Pizza Hut and Wendy's, have already announced multiyear closure plans that extend into 2026, as have some niche stores.\n\nMany companies, such as Macy's, are closing their physical stores to invest more resources into their online businesses.\n\nIn 2025, Business Insider tracked around 4,100 closures as of late December. Retail data and consultant firm Coresight Research predicted earlier in the year that roughly 15,000 retail locations would close in the year.\n\nSo far for 2026, Business Insider has identified about 870 planned closures.\n\nSee the list of major closures below.\n\nIn a November 2025 earnings call, Wendy's interim CEO Ken Cook said the company planned to close a number of underperforming locations, representing a \"mid-single-digit percentage\" of its roughly 6,000 US locations. Roughly 5% of Wendy's restaurants would come out to around 300 locations.\n\nRestaurant chain Pizza Hut is set to close 250 underperforming stores in the US during the first half of 2026, its parent company, Yum! Brands, said in February. The reduction comes as part of a program to accelerate the Pizza Hut brand in the long term.\n\nThe company said that the 250 targeted closures are a fraction of the 20,000 locations that Yum! Brands operates globally.\n\nCarter's, one of North America's biggest children's and baby apparel retailers, said in October that it plans to close 150 stores across the region over the next three years as leases expire, including about 100 by the end of 2026.\n\nIn January 2025, Macy's said it planned to close 150 locations through 2026, allowing it to focus on its best-performing locations and online experience. After the closures are complete, about 350 Macy's stores are expected to remain. Macy's closed at least 66 stores in 2025.\n\nGrocery giant Kroger said in June 2025 that it planned to close 60 \"unprofitable\" stores across the US over the next 18 months. The company said in September that it had begun that process.",

    "description": "The software stock correction could morph into a full-on long-term beating, Goldman Sachs warns.",
    "fullText": "The Great Software Stock Rout of 2026 may be just the beginning, Goldman Sachs warned.\n\nAnd one should look no further than how the rise of the internet in the early 2000s hammered the newspaper industry to get a taste of what may be to come.\n\n\"One lesson from historical examples of industries facing disruption risk is that share price stability requires stability in the earnings outlook. Newspapers, for example, faced risk from technological disruption as the internet grew in the early 2000s. The share prices of the group declined by an average of 95% between 2002 and 2009,\" Goldman Sachs strategist Ben Snider said in a new note.\n\nWhich software companies are most threatened by AI?\n\nWhat could help software stocks recover from decline?\n\nHow is AI disruption affecting software stock performance?\n\nWhat parallels exist between newspapers and software stocks?\n\nSnider added, \"The multi-year decline of newspaper stocks ended only as earnings estimates bottomed, and the litigation disruption of tobacco followed a similar pattern. In this case, the uncertainty around the eventual impact of AI means near-term earnings results will be important signals of business resilience, but in many cases insufficient to disprove the long-term downside risk.\"\n\nThe news flow around software stocks has been ugly as investors try to gauge how much profit in the space is at risk because of rapid AI advances.\n\nThe market fully believes software companies such as Salesforce (CRM), Workday (WDAY), Thomson Reuters (TRI), SAP (SAP), and ServiceNow (NOW) have their terminal values threatened by AI.\n\nJust look at what Anthropic (ANTH.PVT) debuted a week ago, which initially flew a little under the radar before sparking another software rout. The AI developer introduced plug-ins for its Claude Cowork agent that could automate tasks across legal, sales, marketing, and data analysis.\n\nShares of Thomson Reuters, LegalZoom.com (LZ), PayPal (PYPL), Expedia Group (EXPE), Equifax (EFX), and Intuit (INTU) have all subsequently crashed. A strong buy-the-dip mindset in these stocks hasn't yet materialized, and it's unclear what positive catalyst could get investors interested again.\n\nSoftware stocks are now underperforming the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) by the largest margin this century.\n\nBig names have been railroaded, headlined by 27% declines in Oracle (ORCL) and Salesforce. Figma (FIG) — which IPO-ed amid much hype in 2025 — has seen its stock crater 41% this year.\n\n\"Software is contending with a steadily more bearish narrative, amplified by each new AI release that investors perceive as disrupting software,\" Evercore analyst Kirk Materne said.\n\n\"The common thread across nearly every software downturn is that the sector tends to outperform the S&P once it finds a bottom,\" he said. \"The harder question is how much pain remains before getting there, but there are no 'silver bullets' in terms of shifting sentiment.\"",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. Average rates are low, but they could rise if Friday's inflation report is strong. Lock in your rate today.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nCurrent mortgage rates are relatively low. According to Zillow, the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 5.95%, and the 15-year fixed rate is 5.43% — rates under 6% and 5.5% are exciting milestones. Rates are likely low due to economic factors, including the disappointing job openings report released last week. Inflation data comes out on Friday, and mortgage rates could increase if the report shows that inflation is rising more slowly.\n\nMORE: 6% or less — See which lenders have the best mortgage rates this week.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 5.95%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 5.95% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,789, and you’d pay $344,047 in interest over the life of the loan.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.43% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.43% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,440. But you’d only pay $139,222 in interest over the life of the loan. That's a sizable savings.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate will go up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 5.95%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.43%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 5.93%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 5.95%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. Zillow's rates are usually lower than those reported by Freddie Mac and elsewhere. Each source compiles rates using different methods. Zillow obtains rates from its lender marketplace, and Freddie Mac pulls information from loan applications submitted to its underwriting system. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S. And of course, your credit score.\n\nAccording to January forecasts, the MBA expects the 30-year mortgage rate to be near 6.1% through 2026. Fannie Mae also predicts a 30-year rate near 6% through the end of the year.\n\nTo refinance your mortgage, you need a certain amount of home equity. The rules vary by loan type and refi program.

    "fullText": "The United States has taken a major step to accelerate production of Tomahawk, AMRAAM and other missiles. Therefore, the Department of War has signed five landmark agreements with RTX's Raytheon. \n\nThe deal aims to significantly increase production capacity and speed deliveries of Land Attack and Maritime Strike variants of Tomahawk, AMRAAM missiles, Standard Missile-3 Block IB interceptors (SM-3 IB), Standard Missile-3 Block IIA interceptors (SM-3 IIA), and Standard Missile-6 (SM-6).\n\nThe company revealed that as global demand for these precision munitions continues to grow, these up-to-seven-year agreements establish frameworks to build on the company's previous investments to expand production.\n\nUnder the frameworks announced, RTX will increase annual production of Tomahawks to more than 1,000, AMRAAMs to at least 1,900, and SM-6 to more than 500. RTX will also increase production of SM-3 IIA and accelerate production of the SM-3 IB. Many of these munitions will grow 2 to 4 times their existing production rates, according to a press release.\n\n\"These agreements redefine how government and industry can partner to speed the delivery of critical technologies and are a direct result of the administration's Acquisition Transformation Strategy and commitment to deliver the best technologies faster,\" said RTX CEO and Chairman Chris Calio. \n\n\"We are proud to support the department's Arsenal of Freedom to ensure the United States and its allies and partners have the decisive edge — now and in the future.\"\n\nRTX will accelerate production of Tomahawk, which is a precision weapon launched from ships and submarines and it can strike targets precisely from 1,000 miles away, even in heavily defended airspace. U.S. and allied militaries have flight tested the Tomahawk over 550 times and used it in an operational environment more than 2,300 times. It is routinely the first option employed by U.S. forces to target hostile forces anywhere in the world.\n\nThe company will also boost production of AMRAAM, which is the world's most widely deployed, air-to-air missile. Since 2024, Raytheon has been producing the fifth-generation AMRAAM, featuring advanced guidance, software-defined capabilities and enhanced electronic protection for highly contested combat environments. \n\nIn service with more than 40 allies and partners, AMRAAM is integrated across fourth and fifth-generation aircraft and serves as the primary interceptor for NASAMS, supporting both air-to-air and ground-based air defense. Production nearly doubled in 2025 from 2024 and performance has been proven through more than 6,000 test shots and 13 air-to-air combat victories.\n\nRTX has invested heavily in capacity expansion to accelerate production of several critical munitions and will continue investing in capacity expansion and production acceleration projects. Production under these framework agreements will be completed at Raytheon facilities in Tucson, Ariz., Huntsville, Ala., and Andover, Mass, as per the release.\n\nThe company investments associated with these framework agreements have been contemplated in RTX's recently announced financial outlook for 2026. The long-term agreements incorporate a collaborative funding approach designed to preserve upfront free cash flow, allowing RTX to invest confidently to meet long-term demand.",

    "title": "New Maryland state park, complete with yurts and cabins, set to open late this summer",
    "description": "The state purchased Savage River Lodge for $8.7M, and plans to invest nearly a million dollars in improvements, officials say.",
    "fullText": "The inside of a yurt at the new Savage Highlands State Park. (Photo Courtesy of Maryland DNR)\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Mike Dreisbach and his wife Jan purchased a patch of forest in Garrett County with the dream of opening a wilderness retreat.\n\nSome thirty years later, their land, now featuring a woodsy lodge, and a network of cabins and yurts, is set to be reopened as one of Maryland’s next — and perhaps most unique — state parks. An opening is planned for late August, state officials say.\n\n“We leveraged our lives and created something that was pretty phenomenal,” said Dreisbach, 75. “I have complete faith in Maryland … It will be one of the greatest parks in the state.”\n\nDreisbach said that the couple had a higher bid from a Pennsylvania-based investment firm, but opted to sell the land to the state, in hopes that the small woodland resort they built outside of Frostburg would retain its character.\n\n“That was 30 years of our life, from dreaming, to building, to running it,” Dreisbach said. “We wanted to turn it over to somebody that would not screw it up.”\n\nThe 42-acre property, formerly known as Savage River Lodge, is nestled within Savage River State Forest, meaning the state has secured a much-desired privately held parcel that interrupted the state land, known in park ranger parlance as an “in-holding.”\n\n“You really worry, if it were to change hands to another private operation, what could happen to that in-holding?” asked Sarah Milbourne, western region manager at the Maryland Park Service. “So this was such a do-not-miss opportunity for us.”\n\nEver since the state purchased the property in December 2024 for $8.7 million, Maryland Park Service officials say park rangers and contractors have been hurriedly completing maintenance and repair projects on the aging buildings and the grounds.\n\nReplacing the lodge roof. Remediating a bat infestation. Repairing siding and painting decks. Removing hazardous trees and invasive vegetation. Adding primitive camp sites tucked into the forest.\n\nAnd there’s much more to come. The state plans significant repairs to the single, mile-long gravel road that leads to the property. The state expects to outfit the cabins and yurts with kitchenettes, and several need to be made accessible for people with disabilities, Milbourne said.\n\nBut state officials say that the spend — which the state Board of Public Works approved at 10% of the purchase price, or over $800,000 — will all be worth it.\n\nWhen they reopen the park, christened Savage Highlands, some time around late August, they will begin offering resort-style facilities for rent — but at a considerably cheaper price, befitting that of a state park, opening the parks doors to an entirely new host of visitors.\n\n“There aren’t a ton of opportunities in the state to have this — maybe a little upper-level — experience, where you still are nestled in a forest, so close to fly-fishing streams and so close to really great trails,” Milbourne said. “I mean, you could step out of a cabin and almost onto a trail right away.”\n\nThe exact rental cost has yet to be determined, Milbourne said, but she is confident it will be a reduction compared to when it was under private ownership, when stays could cost hundreds per night.\n\nThat said, many of the experiences once offered to lodge guests won’t be available at the new state park. The lodge once featured a restaurant and bar, for instance, which also kept cabin and yurt guests well-fed. But when the property opens to visitors later this year, it will remain shuttered.\n\nThe department is still considering whether it will operate some sort of concessions venue at the lodge, Milbourne said, but one thing is certain — that would be put out for a bid to a private contractor.\n\n“We do a lot of things very well. Running a restaurant is not necessarily a park ranger’s forte,” Milbourne said.\n\nThe opening will also occur in phases, Milbourne said. At first, the state will open the main lodge, but only a select number of cabins and yurts for rentals. At the beginning, the park will also close during the winter months, Milbourne said, because of the condition of the road leading to the property.\n\nTo some observers, the wait-time is a signal that the property may be requiring more work than the state anticipated. Mike Gregory, who lives close to Savage Highlands and formerly served as superintendent at nearby New Germany State Park from 1994 to 2009, said he fears that the state overpaid.\n\n“They spent an inordinate amount of money, and they will continue to spend an inordinate amount of money to make this look like a good purchase, when, in fact, it’s a white elephant,” Gregory said.\n\nMilbourne noted that while there have been “quirks” with the property, they come with the territory of purchasing a property like Savage Lodge. She estimated that standing up a new state park in the region, which experiences a high demand for overnight stays, could cost triple what the state paid for the park.\n\n“People were concerned about Maryland making this decision, but what we have found is that especially in Western Maryland, every one of our cabins are booked all the time and people are clamoring to get in, and clamoring to have experiences — and ones that are accessible, ones that are affordable.”\n\nAnd the property, especially with its lodge, resembling one tucked beneath ski slopes, provides something unique that other Park Service properties just don’t, Milbourne said.\n\n“When you’re driving on the road into that place, and you’re driving through some of the evergreens, I mean, you can expect to see a black bear run across the road. I’ve seen turkeys,” Milbourne said. “It’s still wild, still rustic. But again, still so comfortable and homey. To sit by the fire in that lodge after a long day — it’s just fantastic.”\n\nGregory said he also fears, however, that the new park will place a strain on the Park Service’s already scarce resources.\n\nAlready, the state is using field staff from New Germany to assist with the repairs, Milbourne said, though it has also pulled in staff from other parks to assist with big projects. But additional hires are planned, Milbourne said, predominantly seasonal workers.\n\nDreisbach said that at its peak in visitorship, which came in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, the lodge employed some 40 people, some of them part-time and others full-time.\n\n“We paid for a lot of college educations at Frostburg State,” he joked.\n\nDreisbach and his wife also lived on the property, in a home that the state obtained as part of the deal. So, these days, the duo are traveling the country in a newly purchased motor home — and visiting plenty of parks.\n\nBut one day, their travels could bring them back to their old stomping grounds, now in state hands.\n\n“We’re looking to go back there and stay one day,” Dreisbach said.\n\nSUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Ghislaine Maxwell, the former girlfriend of Jeffrey Epstein, declined to answer questions from House lawmakers in a deposition Monday, but indicated that if President Donald Trump ended her prison sentence, she was willing to testify that neither he nor former President Bill Clinton had done anything wrong in their relationships with Epstein.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee had wanted Maxwell to answer questions during a video call to the federal prison camp in Texas where she’s serving a 20-year sentence for sex trafficking, but she invoked her Fifth Amendment rights to avoid answering questions that would be self-incriminating. She’s come under new scrutiny as lawmakers try to investigate how Epstein, a well-connected financier, was able to sexually abuse underage girls for years.\n\nAmid a reckoning over Epstein's abuse that has spilled into nations around the globe, lawmakers are searching for anyone who was connected to Epstein and may have facilitated his abuse. So far, the revelations have shown how both Trump and Clinton spent time with Epstein in the 1990s and early 2000s, but they have not been credibly accused of wrongdoing.\n\nDuring the closed-door deposition Monday, an attorney for Maxwell told lawmakers that if Trump granted her clemency, she would be willing to testify that neither Trump nor Clinton were culpable for wrongdoing in their relationships with Epstein, according to both Democratic and Republican lawmakers who exited the closed-door meeting.\n\nDemocrats said that was a brazen effort by Maxwell to have Trump end her prison sentence.\n\n“It’s very clear she’s campaigning for clemency,” said Rep. Melanie Stansbury, a New Mexico Democrat.\n\nAnother Democratic lawmaker, Rep. Suhas Subramanyam, described Maxwell’s demeanor during the short video call as “robotic” and “unrepentant.”\n\nTrump has not ruled out granting Maxwell clemency, but Republican pushback to that notion quickly rose after Maxwell made the appeal.\n\n“NO CLEMENCY. You comply or face punishment,” Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna, wrote on social media. “You deserve JUSTICE for what you did you monster.”\n\nMaxwell has been seeking to have her conviction overturned, arguing that she was wrongfully convicted. The Supreme Court rejected her appeal last year, but in December she requested that a federal judge in New York consider what her attorneys describe as “substantial new evidence” that her trial was spoiled by constitutional violations.\n\nMaxwell's attorney cited that petition as he told lawmakers she would invoke her Fifth Amendment rights.\n\nThe Republican chair of the committee, Rep. James Comer of Kentucky, told reporters that it was “very disappointing” that Maxwell declined to participate in the deposition.\n\nFamily members of the late Virginia Giuffre, one of the most outspoken victims of Epstein, also released a letter to Maxwell making it clear they did not consider her “a bystander” to Epstein's abuse.\n\n“You were a central, deliberate actor in a system built to find children, isolate them, groom them, and deliver them to abuse,” Sky and Amanda Roberts wrote in the letter addressed to Maxwell.\n\nMaxwell was moved from a federal prison in Florida to a low-security prison camp in Texas last summer after she participated in two-days of interviews with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche.\n\nComer had also subpoenaed her at the time, but her attorneys have consistently told the committee that she wouldn't answer questions. However, Comer came under pressure to hold the deposition as he pressed for the committee to enforce subpoenas on Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. After Comer threatened them with contempt of Congress charges, they both agreed to sit for depositions later this month.\n\nComer has been haggling with the Clintons over whether that testimony should be held in a public hearing, but Comer reiterated Monday that he would insist on holding closed-door depositions and later releasing transcripts and video.\n\nMeanwhile, several lawmakers also planned on Monday to look through unredacted versions of the files on Epstein that the Department of Justice has released to comply with a law passed by Congress last year.",

    "fullText": "Billionaire Mark Cuban has heard every version of \"how would you start over?\" But in a Wired \"Tech Support\" Q&A in 2023, someone finally raised the stakes.\n\n\"You have six months to make as much money as possible,\" he said. \"All you have to start with is a phone and $500 in cash. What are you doing?\"\n\n\"That is the best question I have ever been asked in my entire adult life,\" Cuban said. And then he gave a step-by-step answer that didn't include flipping phones, trading crypto, or launching an app.\n\nThe ‘ChatGPT of Marketing' Just Opened a $0.85/Share Round — 10,000+ Investors Are Already In\n\nBlue-chip art has historically outpaced the S&P 500 since 1995, and fractional investing is now opening this institutional asset class to everyday investors.\n\n\"I'm going to find a sales job,\" he told Wired. \"Because I already know that if I'm down to my last $500, and all I have is a phone, I am going to get that job and I am going to learn more about that industry than anyone on the planet.\"\n\nHe wasn't joking. For the first three months, Cuban said he'd live on commission — focusing on one goal: becoming the top-performing salesperson in the building. After that, he'd cash in.\n\n\"Three months in, when I've demonstrated that I am the best salesperson in the history of that company, I'm going to walk into my boss' office and I'm going to tell him or her: ‘You're either going to pay me this amount of money to keep me, or I'm going to start my own business selling this stuff,'\" he said. \"That is exactly what I would do.\"\n\nTrending: Earn While You Scroll: The Deloitte-Ranked #1 Software Company Growing 32,481% Is Opening Its $0.50/Share Round to Accredited Investors.\n\nCuban built his career on this mindset. Before becoming a billionaire, he sold garbage bags door-to-door at 12, launched MicroSolutions out of his apartment, and made $5.7 billion selling Broadcast.com to Yahoo. From cold calls to billion-dollar exits, his pitch has always been his power.\n\nAnd on \"Shark Tank,\" it wasn't the backstory or the business plan that sealed the deal — it was the pitch. Cuban told GQ in 2023, \"You're not trying to convince people. You're trying to help them.\"\n\nNot everyone's built for sales. And not everyone wants to talk their way to the top. That doesn't mean they can't still be part of the next big thing.",

Scattered across its vast archaeological park are monasteries, reservoirs and stupas that rank among the most ambitious religious monuments ever built.\n\nTowering above them is the immense, bubble-shaped dome of Jetavanaramaya — a structure so large that when it was completed in the early fourth century CE, it ranked as the third-largest man‑made building on Earth, surpassed only by the Great Pyramids of Giza.\n\nCompleted around 301 CE using an estimated 93.3 million baked mud bricks, the stupa originally rose to around 122 meters (400 feet), making it one of the tallest structures of the ancient world.\n\nToday, after centuries of collapse, abandonment and restoration, Jetavanaramaya stands at roughly 71 meters (233 feet) — still monumental, but little more than half its original height. Even so, it remains the largest brick structure by volume ever constructed.\n\nSo vast is its mass that archaeologists estimate its bricks could build a three-foot-high wall stretching from London to Edinburgh — or from New York City to Pittsburgh.\n\nYet outside Sri Lanka, Jetavanaramaya is little known. Unlike the pyramids, it was not continuously visible to history. Jungle growth, shifting religious priorities and selective preservation gradually buried both the monument and much of its story, leaving one of the ancient world’s greatest engineering achievements largely forgotten.\n\nJetavanaramaya refers not only to the stupa itself, but to the heart of a vast monastic complex known as Jetavana Vihara, designed to house hundreds of monks. Every structure in the complex was oriented toward the stupa, ensuring that monks stepping outside their residences would face it first — a daily reminder of devotion and cosmological order.\n\n“About 200 monks lived here,” explains Godamune Pannaseeha, a bespectacled monk and senior archaeology officer in Anuradhapura, and one of the foremost contemporary experts on Jetavanaramaya.\n\n“People came to offer robes, books, food — everything — to gain merit,” he says, pointing to the lower terraces of the stupa where offerings were once made, while walking a slow, clockwise circuit around its base. “This was a living religious city.”\n\nFrom the outset, however, Jetavanaramaya was controversial. It was built on land traditionally associated with the Maha Vihara, the orthodox Theravada Buddhist establishment, reportedly without the consent of its monks. The complex later became associated with the Sagalika sect, which followed Mahayana‑leaning doctrines.\n\nNo Mahayana chronicles from ancient Sri Lanka have survived. Today, Sri Lanka remains a predominantly Theravada Buddhist nation. As a result, much of Jetavanaramaya’s history — including the political and doctrinal tensions surrounding its creation — must be reconstructed indirectly, leaving historians with incomplete and sometimes contested versions.\n\nThe technical challenges involved in building Jetavanaramaya were immense. Unlike Egypt’s stone pyramids, this colossal structure was built almost entirely from mud bricks — a material far more vulnerable to erosion and collapse.\n\n“To replace one stone block, you need perhaps 10 bricks,” says Anura Manatunga, senior professor of archaeology at Sri Lanka’s University of Kelaniya. “That means millions upon millions of bricks had to be prepared, transported and laid with precision.”\n\nArchaeologists have identified ancient brick kilns in and around Anuradhapura, confirming large‑scale brick production in the region. None, however, can yet be definitively linked to Jetavanaramaya or securely dated to the early fourth century.\n\nMoving this volume of material would have required extraordinary organization — and labor.\n\nWhile no records specifically mention animals at Jetavanaramaya, historians believe elephants and bullock carts were almost certainly used, as they were at other major Sri Lankan construction sites — including Ruwanwelisaya, the city’s most sacred stupa, built centuries earlier in 140 BCE.\n\nElephants likely hauled bricks and stamped down soil at the foundations, a technique used in traditional construction on the island until relatively recent times.\n\nScaffolding would have relied heavily on bamboo, bound with coir rope made from coconut fibre and jungle creepers. Metal was used sparingly, reserved for tools rather than structural elements.\n\nJetavanaramaya reflects the height of ancient Sri Lankan engineering knowledge. Its massive hemispherical form distributes weight efficiently, while its foundations were carefully prepared. Ancient chronicles describe how builders flooded excavated ground to observe absorption — a rudimentary but effective form of soil testing.\n\nA fallen section of the stupa reveals further ingenuity. Pannaseeha points out a hollow, cylindrical chamber within the ruins that suggests an early understanding of ventilation.\n\nDespite this sophistication, time has taken its toll. Earthquakes, monsoon rains and centuries of abandonment caused sections of the stupa to collapse. The last major renovation took place in the 12th century, during the reign of King Parakramabahu I.\n\nMore recent restoration efforts introduced cement into some outer layers — a decision archaeologists now believe may have accelerated deterioration rather than prevented it. The original mortar used to lay its bricks was composed of a mixture of finely crushed dolomite, limestone, sieved sand and clay.\n\nExcavations have also uncovered reliquary caskets embedded throughout the stupa at different structural levels. These held sacred relics and ritual deposits, reinforcing Jetavanaramaya’s role not only as an architectural feat but as a sacred structure built from the inside out.\n\nAmong the most significant discoveries linked to Jetavanaramaya are gold panels depicting Bodhisattva imagery and inscribed with sections of the Prajñāpāramitā sutra, a foundational Mahayana Buddhist text. Now held at the National Museum in Colombo, the panels were written in Sanskrit using ancient local scripts.\n\nThey offer rare material evidence of Mahayana practice in ancient Sri Lanka, suggesting Jetavana was once a center of cosmopolitan Buddhist thought, connected by doctrine and trade routes to India and beyond.\n\nStanding at the base of the stupa, Pannaseeha gestures toward the damaged spire.\n\n“Historical accounts say that a diamond once crowned the pinnacle, possibly to deflect lightning during monsoon storms,” he says.\n\nThe spire itself is unusual. “It resembles a tower,” he notes — a form some scholars believe may reflect technological influence from the Roman or broader Mediterranean world, transmitted through Indian Ocean trade networks.\n\nWhether symbolic or functional, much about its construction remains unclear.\n\n“We can see small remains of the decorative motifs, including those of the Naga, a cobra-hood form,” Pannaseeha adds, pointing to intricate carvings at the base. “But we still don’t know exactly how they were fixed in place.”\n\nJetavanaramaya’s immense scale invites comparison with Ruwanwelisaya, the gleaming white stupa nearby that today holds far greater religious significance for Sri Lankans.\n\nRuwanwelisaya is believed to enshrine some of Buddhism’s most venerated relics, including a portion of the Buddha’s remains. It remains the focal point of pilgrimage and national religious life.\n\nThough smaller than Jetavanaramaya in its original form, Ruwanwelisaya has been continuously maintained and today rises higher than Jetavana’s truncated structure, standing at more than 100 meters (328 feet).\n\nWhere Jetavanaramaya represents architectural audacity and doctrinal debate, Ruwanwelisaya embodies devotional continuity.\n\nEetalawetunwawe Gnanathilaka Thero, one of the country’s most respected religious figures and chief monk at the Ruwanwelisaya, has noticed a steady increase in foreign visitors to Anuradhapura in recent years.\n\n“First there was civil war, then a pandemic,” he says. “But the past two years, there has been a noticeable increase in foreign visitors to our holy city.”\n\nTravelers are welcome to observe — and participate in — any of the nine daily puja rituals, with the first beginning at dawn.\n\nVisit on a full moon day and thousands of pilgrims arrive, waiting patiently to enter Ruwanwelisaya and Sri Maha Bodhi, the temple that surrounds a sacred fig tree believed to be grown from a sapling of the tree under which the Buddha attained enlightenment.\n\nPerhaps the most striking fact about Jetavanaramaya is that nothing like it was ever built again. For nearly 700 years after its completion, no stupa of comparable scale was attempted in Sri Lanka.\n\n“This was the last truly gigantic stupa,” Manatunga says. “Not only here, but even in Southeast Asia, later builders adopted the same bubble-shaped form — but never at this scale.”\n\nJetavanaramaya stands today as evidence of an ancient society capable of organizing labor, materials and engineering knowledge on a scale that rivalled any civilization of its time.\n\nThat it remains relatively unknown beyond Sri Lanka may be one of history’s great oversights — a reminder that some of the ancient world’s most extraordinary achievements were not carved in stone, but shaped from earth, devotion and human ingenuity.",

    "fullText": "Black and trans drag performers are crowdfunding to survive in one of the most expensive cities in the world.\n\nAfter he somersaults on the bar in six-inch stilettos and a blood-stained, Chucky’s-bride-themed white corset, the crowd at Bushwick’s queer-owned Pink Metal Bar roars in delight for Xaddy Addy, a Black transmasculine drag king and sideshow performer. The audience has gathered in the intimate bar for Superstar Open Set’s Halloween show, an open stage that Xaddy Addy cohosts each week alongside drag performer Pachacvnti. After a night of performances from Brooklyn’s emerging talent, the crowd remains spellbound as Xaddy Addy staples cash tips to his cheeks, thighs, and hips. Not even the loud cheering drowns out the clack of the staple gun as it pierces his skin. His self-assured, “weird” drag performance—an expansive genre melding drag with horror, stunts, and complex dramaturgy—belies the economic insecurity and discrimination he faced while building a following.\n\nManhattan native Xaddy Addy tells me that drag was “a way to save his life” after years of doing sex work “100 percent out of survival.” For many, drag is both a calling and an art form—one that contributes to New York’s $35 billion nightlife economy. But income from their performances barely covers their bills in one of the most expensive cities in the world, where the average rent soars beyond $3,000. Many Black and trans performers are crowdfunding on social media to cover rent, medical bills, and groceries.\n\n“You have some of the best Black trans drag performers in the world in your city,” says Klondyke, a Black drag artist and sideshow performer. “Why are they starving? Why am I seeing more people that are Black and trans posting mutual aid than posting shows that they’re in?”\n\nWith the election of Mayor Zohran Mamdani, drag artists are hopeful about his promises to make the city more affordable, by freezing rent for stabilized housing, and to expand protections for trans New Yorkers. But they argue that policy changes alone will not be enough to undo decades of decisions that have disenfranchised the city’s marginalized residents. That will take all of us.\n\nDrag performance artists occupy a precarious ledge in New York’s gentrified landscape. The city’s exorbitant costs of living, along with Trump’s despotic policies, have caused residents and tourists to opt out of live entertainment. “I can’t tell you how many shows I’ve been a part of that have been well promoted, the promo’s gorgeous, the cast is posting, the tickets are not too expensive,” Bri Joy, a drag king and go-go dancer, says. “All the conditions are correct for a beautiful day at the beach, and then no one shows up at the beach.”\n\nBut Black and brown artists have faced decades of discrimination over the years, long before Donald Trump kicked off his crusade against trans people. In the 1990s and early 2000s, Afrosephone, a showgirl from New York, remembers, “the girls and the dolls went to work” across swaths of Manhattan—from the West Side Piers to the iconic La Escuelita on West 39th Street. By contrast, white venues permitted Black or Latine people only on designated nights. These clubs “were a thousand times worse back then,” Afrosephone says, “where they could be openly racist to you.” Black and brown artists forged their own spaces underground, and their contributions to nightlife attracted tourists, a new generation of queer transplants, and, inevitably, the cops.\n\nIn response to the proliferation of underground clubbing, former Mayor Rudy Giuliani disproportionately raided Black and brown clubs for dancing, smoking, or playing loud music. He also wiped the dust off the Prohibition-era Cabaret Law, which outlaws dancing in venues without a pricey cabaret license. Giuliani’s policies, ostensibly aimed to reduce crime, sought to attract wealthy transplants and business owners to the city. Mayor Mike Bloomberg continued these draconian measures into the early 2010s. A long battle with the NY State Liquor Authority ended in La Escuelita’s untimely closing in 2016, only a year before Mayor Bill de Blasio finally repealed the Cabaret Law.\n\nThe NYPD’s crusade on Black and brown clubs robbed performers of cultural sanctuary and employment options. Real estate developers and culture-hungry newcomers flocked to pick at the ruins. Venue owners and event producers shut Black performers out of regimented clubs, where partygoers shuffled into VIP sections, hardly danced, and snapped photos of ostentatious bottle service. Today, Black and trans artists continue to face discriminatory hiring practices.\n\nBri Joy says that many promoters adhere to the “paper bag test”—if a drag performer’s skin is darker than a paper bag, then they’re turned away from certain clubs. Trans artists face compounded scrutiny from audiences and other drag performers, who have asked Bri Joy probing questions like “What kind of trans are you?” and outed Afrosephone on stage without her consent.\n\n“Even now, especially in Manhattan, there can only be one or two top Black performers at a time,” Afrosephone says. “We’re at the mercy of these establishments that don’t truly want to work with us.”\n\nMayor Bill de Blasio’s relatively progressive policy decisions led to ephemeral gains for drag artists. Along with expanding labor rights and housing protections, de Blasio founded the Office of Nightlife (ONL) to support workers and local business development after dark.\n\nWhen Covid restrictions were lifted in 2021, Klondyke recalls that “a lot of corporate and white money” was being “thrown at drag” programs. Diverse drag lineups attracted audiences who toted stimulus checks and a nascent, if not fleeting, solidarity with people of color after the Black Lives Matter movement of 2020. “I was doing at least three or four shows a week for over a year, and that was able to sustain me,” Klondyke says. “Then it just starts to fizzle.” Once the news cycle closed the chapter on racial justice, so did the city’s doors and wallets.\n\nBooks & the Arts\n\n /\n\n Michael Kazin\n\nEric Adams pledged to revive the nightlife economy when he was elected mayor in 2022. During his term, he frequently appeared at swanky Midtown venues where he dined on branzino with his inner circle, including convicted fraudsters and former Governor Andrew Cuomo—whose tenure saw steep increases in housing costs and a decline in the number of Black residents.\n\nThe New York City Council sued Adams for blocking legislation to offer more housing vouchers and recently overruled his proposal to hike Section 8 rents. His $650 million campaign to combat street homelessness raises questions about the plan’s execution, given that his former policies led to increased policing in subway stations and forced displacements of unhoused people.\n\nAdams, to his credit, led the transition from Giuliani’s authoritarian MARCH program, in which police cracked down on clubs without warning, to CURE, an initiative that mediates nightlife violations before resorting to harsh police enforcement. While these measures bridge the gap between city government and nightlife venues, Adams’ administration failed to meaningfully address the most pertinent threats to nightlife workers: housing insecurity and finding safe, steady work.\n\n“There have been one or two times where I’ve had a bout of unemployment and I’ve tried to make it work with just nightlife,” says Bri Joy. “I owed so much back rent and I was the brokest I’d ever been in my life. It was the first time that I’d really seen my account hit actual zero.”\n\nEven New York’s “Freelance Isn’t Free” law, which protects freelancers’ rights, requires written contracts only for projects of $800 or more with a single employer. But underground drag artists often earn up to a couple hundred dollars from gigs, if they’re paid at all, and recurring bookings are difficult to come by. In August 2024, the ONL reported that its efforts to expand affordability for DIY spaces were “currently on hold”—despite the fact that increased access to venues would help drag performers and producers like Vague Static create more employment opportunities.\n\n“It’s gonna be a lot easier a lot of the time for a white producer to get into the clubs, to produce a thing, and pay the people,” says Vague Static. They are a co-organizer of Lil’ Park Drag Show, a free program that took a hiatus this year following a spike in transphobic safety threats. “I do not have the money to pay the people for their time.”\n\nA 2019 ONL study reports that income stability and gig competition pose substantial hurdles to 80 percent of nightlife entertainers, and drag is especially cutthroat. Individualism, prejudice, and poor conflict resolution within the drag community—even among other LGBTQ+ people of color—widen the gaps of public policy failures.\n\nDrag kings in particular are disregarded and underpaid compared to drag queens and well-known entertainers, who use “words like community and friendship to get close to you,” only to disappear when they find “a better booking,” according to Klondyke. These discrepancies have material consequences. In January, after Klondyke failed to secure consistent work and accumulated $10,000 in unpaid rent, his landlord evicted him and his partner from their Brooklyn apartment. “Our income is very sporadic,” reads Klondyke’s fundraiser for housing costs. “We are at the end of our rope.” Although Klondyke began fundraising in 2024, his campaign is still less than halfway to its goal, and his search for secure housing wears on.\n\n“When you become silent, you fall into the similar categories of the rising conservatism that we see in this country,” Xaddy Addy says. “People are left to feel alone and invisible and think to themselves, what does it even mean to be in these spaces? What does it even mean to exist in this life?”\n\nFor as long as Black trans artists have existed in New York City, they have addressed their uncertain living situations with community-based solutions. In 1968, drag queen Crystal LaBeija created the House of LaBeija—an artist-led collective that offered mentorship and support networks to Black trans talent—to resist the racial discrimination she faced in ballroom pageants, where women of color lightened their faces to compete for white judges only to lose to non-Black talent. LaBeija’s house system was the first of its kind, not only launching drag to international acclaim but offering a blueprint for how drag artists can support each other in moments of need. “There would be no ballroom or drag culture without Crystal LaBeija,” says Afrosephone.\n\nDuring the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, performers relied on drag collectives, where drag artists shared costumes, exchanged industry knowledge, and hosted in-person events like “Takes the Cake,” “a drag competition for drag king, things, and other non-binary & queer performers.” Klondyke, who “came up in the time of collectives” and won Takes the Cake in 2021, recalls the electrifying presence these opportunities carried, “especially for kings and things,” who were “excited to have spaces to do our thing.”\n\nThe Cake Boys, the drag collective behind Takes the Cake, had to shutter their live event programming in 2024, but other underground initiatives have sprouted up to fulfill drag artists’ needs. More recently, Klondyke and Xaddy Addy cofounded Black Cherry Sideshow, the first-ever trans and BIPOC-led drag sideshow, alongside drag artists Selena Surreal and Oliver Herface. The quartet performs every second Saturday of the month at Purgatory Bar in Bushwick, where they engage in a dizzying range of stunts like eating fire, lying on beds of nails, and taking needles and mouse traps to their bare flesh. With an historic one-year anniversary event held last May on Coney Island, Black Cherry Sideshow dares to reimagine the sideshow not as an exploitative spectacle for white consumption but a way for trans performers of color to reclaim their power and, according to Xaddy Addy, “raise the stakes in my drag in a dangerous but safe way.” Along with his sideshow grind, both Xaddy Addy and Afrosephone host open sets to uplift up-and-coming drag artists, while others circulate calls for mutual aid.\n\n“Being a drag performer, I’d much rather [use] art to fight through a fascist system instead of making art to appease a fascist system,” Klondyke says. “The fact that my art is able to exist as a Black trans person is what is political.”\n\nDrag is inextricable from the city’s anti-fascist future. Zohran Mamdani’s use of relationship-building, volunteerism, and media to build power mirrors the tactics of Black and trans-led collectives throughout New York’s history.\n\nSo far, Mamdani has acted on some of his campaign promises and fallen short on others. Although Mamdani called to defund the “racist and anti-queer” NYPD on X in 2020, he roused criticism from progressives after choosing to retain Jessica Tisch, a moderate who increased surveillance across the city and opposes bail reform efforts, as the NYPD commissioner. The decision to maintain Eric Adams’s pro-NYPD appointment, along with his delayed, lackluster response to two fatal police shootings days into his term, cast suspicion over whether he’ll follow through on his pledge to protect New Yorkers who are most vulnerable to police violence.\n\nHe has made more hopeful strides in the realm of nightlife and entertainment, where he elected Freelancers Union leader Rafael Espinal as commissioner of the New York City Mayor’s Office of Media and Entertainment. Espinal led the charge to repeal the Cabaret Law and pass the Freelance Isn’t Free Act as a city councillor under Bill de Blasio. The native Brooklynite’s track record of inclusive policy reforms, along with his recent promises to expand affordability for NYC creatives, seek to meaningfully address the cost-of-living catastrophe that worsened under Adams’ administration.\n\nYet policy changes alone are never enough. True power, as Mamdani even emphasized on his campaign trail, lies in the hands of the people.\n\nNew Yorkers have a responsibility to show up and stand down for nightlife performers by attending drag shows run by Black trans performers, tipping and paying entertainers living wages, and advocating for inclusive hiring practices.\n\n“You shouldn’t wait until somebody is on Drag Race to show your support,” says Afrosephone. “The one thing that will keep us performing, the one thing that will keep us afloat, is if you show up.”\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "description": "Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said there are three big traits the people \"who are wildly successful\" in tech all share.",

And if they wouldn't, you're probably not quite where you ought to be.\"\n\nWhen it comes to those gunning for the C-Suite, or maybe even his job, Robbins said you \"can't underestimate\" the value of EQ.\n\n\"The people who are wildly successful have this really incredible combination — in our industry — understand the technology, have high EQ, and really care about the mission of the team,\" he said.\n\nAs for himself, Robbins said he's always had a way to compartmentalize things he can't control. It's why he said he's nothing that is keeping him awake at night.\n\n\"Look, I've gone home where I've had a really bad day, and I look at my wife, and say, 'You want to hear the good news? I wasn't diagnosed with cancer today,'\" he said. \"And somebody was, and I wasn't. So if my worst day, if I'm not being diagnosed with cancer or some sort of terminal illness, tomorrow I'll get up and fight another fight. You just gotta have perspective.\"",

    "fullText": "OSLO/STOCKHOLM, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Norwegian police are investigating two high-profile diplomats in a corruption probe announced on Monday, part of a widening scandal in the Nordic country and across Europe over prominent figures' ties to late ​sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nMona Juul, who resigned as ambassador to Jordan and Iraq on Sunday, is suspected of gross corruption and her ‌husband, former government minister Terje Roed-Larsen, is suspected of complicity in gross corruption, police said.\n\n\"A new investigation has been opened in connection with the Epstein files ... We are facing a ‌comprehensive and, by all accounts, long-term investigation,\" Norway's financial crimes squad, Oekokrim, said in a statement.\n\nJuul and Roed-Larsen are cooperating with the investigation and see no merit in the accusations against them, their lawyers said.\n\nEPSTEIN FILES REVEAL CLOSE FRIENDSHIP, FINANCIAL TIES\n\nRoed-Larsen's ties to Epstein initially came to light in the Norwegian press in 2019. He has apologised several times for the relationship and in 2020 stepped down as CEO of the New York-based International Peace Institute, a think ⁠tank.\n\nThe couple's connections to the American financier, who ‌killed himself in a New York jail in 2019, returned to the spotlight after the U.S. Justice Department released millions of pages of files related to his case last month.\n\nAmong other references to Juul and Roed-Larsen, the files showed ‍they made plans to visit Epstein's private island with their two children in 2011, though it was unclear if the visit took place.\n\nRoed-Larsen, who appeared to have a deeper friendship with Epstein than his wife, thanked Epstein for \"everything you have done\" in a text message in 2017 and called him his \"best friend\" and a \"thoroughly good ​human being.\"\n\nEpstein also helped the couple negotiate an Oslo apartment purchase in 2018 and in an email exchange told the seller \"it will become ‌unpleasant\" if he backed out of the deal over a price he considered too low.\n\nIn a will signed two days before his death, Epstein stated that the couple's two children would stand to inherit $5 million each.\n\nRoed-Larsen's lawyer, John Christian Elden, said in a statement the police investigation centred on the 2018 real-estate transaction and \"a possible trip in 2011\".\n\n\"Roed-Larsen is confident that once all the factual circumstances have been thoroughly reviewed, the investigation will clarify that there is no basis for criminal liability, and the case will be dismissed,\" Elden said.\n\nPOLICE PROBE WHETHER JUUL RECEIVED BENEFITS TIED TO POSITION\n\nJuul has represented ⁠Norway as ambassador to Israel and Britain and at the United Nations. Referring to ​her, police said Oekokrim would investigate among other things whether \"benefits were received in connection with ​her position.\"\n\nJuul viewed it positively that the allegations against her will now be subject to a thorough investigation, allowing the circumstances to be clarified, her lawyer Thomas Skjelbred said.\n\n\"My client does not recognise the accusations made against her,\" Skjelbred said ‍in a statement.\n\nThe couple were part of ⁠a small group of diplomats facilitating the 1993-1995 Oslo Accords, seen at the time as a breakthrough in the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians, although peace in the region remains elusive.\n\nRoed-Larsen, 78, was briefly a cabinet minister in 1996 under then-Prime Minister Thorbjoern Jagland.\n\nSeveral ⁠other prominent Norwegians also had links to Epstein, including Crown Princess Mette-Marit, who has apologised.\n\nIn Britain, Prime Minister Keir Starmer is pushing back against calls for his resignation over ‌his appointment of Peter Mandelson, who had previously known ties to Epstein, as ambassador to Washington.",

    "fullText": "Republican senators led by Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) are coming to senior White House aide Stephen Miller’s defense after some of their GOP colleagues called for a White House shake-up.\n\nGOP senators rattled over their party’s prospects in the midterms and unhappy with Miller’s public comments on Greenland and immigration enforcement view the deputy White House chief of staff as a growing political liability for both President Trump and the GOP.\n\nBut he commands strong loyalty from a number of Republican senators on Capitol Hill.\n\nGraham, who also came to Miller’s defense last month, told The Hill on Sunday that Miller “is going to be proven right that we should be more aggressive” on immigration policy. And he argued that Miller’s and Trump’s tough talk about Greenland has put the United States in position to substantially strengthen its Arctic defenses.\n\n“People can disagree with Stephen on rhetoric and they can disagree with him on policy but the question is, ‘Is Stephen Miller in jeopardy in Trump World?’ Absolutely not,” Graham said.\n\n“To my Republican colleagues who wring their hands all the time about what somebody says in Trump World: We have an opportunity here to go on the offense. Sanctuary cities are about as popular as a toothache,” he argued. “I would hope that Republicans focus on — the problem’s not with Stephen Miller, Kristi Noem, me or Trump. It’s with four years of Biden policy.\n\n“It doesn’t matter what a senator thinks about a president’s adviser, as long as the president has confidence in that adviser. I have confidence in Stephen Miller that he’s going to help us go on offense,” Graham added. “We’re going to have a vote next week on the Senate floor on sanctuary cities and Stephen Miller helped orchestrate that with me.”\n\nMore than a dozen Republican senators submitted on-the-record comments to The Hill on Sunday praising Miller and pushing back against public and anonymous criticisms from Senate GOP colleagues who want to diminish Miller’s clout at the White House.\n\nSen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.), who represents a critical swing state, for example, said Miller “has been instrumental in delivering on the promises President Trump and I made during the campaign.”\n\n“Because of him and other members of the President’s team, critical priorities like stopping deadly fentanyl, unleashing America’s energy, and bringing much-needed economic relief for working families are now a reality for Pennsylvania,” he said.\n\nEleven other Republican senators offered praise of Miller as key member of Trump’s team.\n\n“I’ve worked with Stephen Miller for more than a decade to secure our borders, lock away criminals, and keep America safe. I highly value his counsel, as I know President Trump does as well,” said Senate Republican Conference Chair Tom Cotton (Ark.).\n\nMiller’s influence over Trump’s immigration enforcement policy has come under increasing scrutiny within the Senate GOP conference as senators face a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department on Friday.\n\nDemocrats are threatening to block even a short-term continuation of Homeland Security funding unless Trump agrees to a list of reforms to “rein in ICE” and “stop the violence.”\n\nMiller’s role in Trump’s muscular approach to foreign policy, particularly threats to use military force against Greenland, also is under a magnifying glass as about 20 senators — Democrats and Republicans — are scheduled to travel to the Munich Security Conference later this week to meet with NATO allies.\n\nThose congressional delegation trips may get canceled because of the looming Homeland Security shutdown, which Democrats are threatening to trigger in protest of the administration’s deportation raids.\n\nA group of Republican senators are becoming fed up with Miller’s clout at the White House and want Trump to bring in advisers with different perspectives into his inner circle.\n\n“I think the truth be told he would not win a majority of a popularity contest in our conference,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), summarizing the view of Miller among Republican senators.\n\n“Number one, he has a condescending demeanor to begin with. He doesn’t take advice. He sort of dictates. He provides doctrine. And you know these are U.S. senators with an election certificate. He should show them some respect,” Tillis added of Miller.\n\nSeveral other GOP senators who spoke on condition of anonymity said they believe Miller has too much power over Trump’s agenda and that his advice on foreign policy and immigration issues is leading the administration toward unpopular positions.\n\nA Republican senator who requested anonymity acknowledged that Tillis, who is not seeking reelection, has been the most outspoken in criticizing Miller. But this GOP senator said Tillis’s views are shared broadly within the Senate GOP conference.\n\nThe lawmaker said many Republican senators view Miller as the driving force behind aggressive apprehensions that are becoming national stories, such as the detention of 5-year-old Liam Conejo Ramos, an asylum-seeker from Ecuador, who was picked up in Minnesota with his father and sent to a holding facility outside San Antonio.\n\n“There are senators from deep-red states describing incidents about kids who are dropped off at school and then the parents are detained after the kids are dropped off, and the [school] principal has to be able to find someone to take the kids,” the source said. “Members say we want to be there for law enforcement, but this is not right.”\n\nA New York Times/Siena College poll of 1,625 registered voters conducted Jan. 12-17 found that 61 percent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) tactics have gone too far and just 36 percent approved of how ICE was handling its job.\n\nA PBS News/NPR/Marist poll of 1,462 adults conducted Jan. 27-30 found that 65 percent of Americans think ICE tactics have gone too far.\n\nA second Republican senator who requested anonymity said colleagues from battleground states want Trump to balance Miller’s influence on immigration policy and other core elements of his agenda with advisers who have different views.\n\n“I think there need to be other people advising the president because certainly for a number of our members that are going to be in tough elections … [they want] different points of view advising the president so that he has a menu of options and selections in front of him,” the senator said. “Some are going to work better in certain states than others. It’s not a broad stroke of the brush here.”\n\nThe senator added that Trump’s policy menu “has been limited” for much of his second term so far, especially on immigration enforcement policy.\n\nBut there’s also a large group of Trump allies in the Senate Republican conference who support Miller’s no-holds-barred approach to immigration policy and are willing to give the administration broad latitude to pressure European allies over Greenland.\n\n“Stephen has effectively pushed for policies that are making America safer, like in Memphis in my home state of Tennessee, more prosperous, and more respected around the world,” said Sen. Bill Hagerty (R-Tenn.).\n\nGraham, who has perhaps the closest relationship with Trump of anyone in the Senate GOP conference, told The Hill that Miller is in many ways the architect of the Make America Great Again movement.\n\nHe predicts that Senate Republicans will unify this week behind Miller’s aggressive approach to sanctuary cities, despite the public backlash sparked by the fatal shootings of two protesters in Minneapolis last month by federal immigration officers.\n\n“Any GOP colleague or observer of Washington that believes that Donald Trump doesn’t have full faith in Stephen Miller should not be allowed to be driving in Washington. He is Karl Rove to MAGA,” Graham said in an interview, referring to President George W. Bush’s top political adviser.\n\nRove was so influential during the earlier administration that he was called “Bush’s Brain.”\n\nGOP Sens. Mike Lee (Utah), Steve Daines (Mont.), Roger Marshall (Kan.), Ted Cruz (Texas), Bernie Moreno (Ohio), James E. Risch (Idaho), Eric Schmitt (Mo.), Cynthia Lummis (Wyo.), Rick Scott (Fla.), and Ron Johnson (Wis.) also submitted statements Sunday praising Miller.\n\nGOP Sens. Jim Banks (Ind.), Marsha Blackburn (Tenn.) and Tommy Tuberville (Ala.) have also praised Miller on social media.\n\n“@StephenM is a long time friend and trusted advisor. Grateful for his leadership and everything he does to help President Trump every day,” Banks posted on the social platform X on Jan. 27.\n\nMiller, who served as a senior adviser to Trump during his first term, has seen his power and authority grow dramatically since then. Correspondingly, Trump has taken a much more aggressive approach toward immigration enforcement and foreign policy within the Western Hemisphere during his second term.\n\nAnd the senior advisers who cautioned the president during his first term to restrain himself on domestic and international affairs — former White House chiefs of staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly, former Attorney General Bill Barr, former Secretaries of Defense Jim Mattis and Mark Esper, and former Chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley — are long gone.\n\nEsper and Miller, for example, clashed over what Esper called Miller’s “absurd” plan to send 250,000 active-duty troops to the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nMiller clashed with other senior advisers including Barr and Milley over how to respond to the Black Lives Matter protests that were raging in cities around the country, according to a book by Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender.\n\nWhen Miller remarked the protests reminded him of a war zone, Milley turned around in his seat, pointed his finger at Miller and said, “Shut the f‑‑‑ up, Stephen,” according to the book.\n\nBut Trump appeared to side at the time with Miller and seemed more inclined to bring force to bear on the protests, despite caution and restraint urged by other senior aides.\n\nMilley has since fallen out of favor with Trump and had his security detail and clearance stripped by the Pentagon in January.\n\nDuring Trump’s second term, Miller has expanded his influence over the president’s foreign policy agenda, proclaiming in CNN interview earlier this year that the United States has a right to take over Greenland.\n\n“You can talk all you want about international niceties and everything else, but we live in a world, in the real world, Jake, that is governed by strength, that is governed by force, that is governed by power,” he told CNN host Jake Tapper.\n\nA third Republican senator who requested anonymity said Miller should stay away from foreign policy, arguing that his swaggering talk about Greenland threatens important NATO alliances.\n\n“The thing is the president is very fond of Stephen Miller and that’s the main thing,” the lawmaker said. “I think there are some things I would rather the administration stay away from,” the lawmaker added, referring to the White House’s aggressive push for Greenland.\n\nThe senator added that talk of seizing Danish territory by military force if necessary and the images of masked ICE and Border Patrol personnel using excessive force on protesters in Minneapolis have fueled Democratic criticism that Trump is leading the country toward authoritarianism.\n\nBut Graham, a prominent defense hawk on Capitol Hill, said that most GOP senators don’t understand what the Trump administration is trying to accomplish by maneuvering for U.S. control of Greenland.\n\n“People have no idea what they’re talking about on Greenland. I’ve been on the ground floor of that. Stephen Miller and a lot of us were helping the president. The critics of Trump seem to have zero depth about what’s really going on,” he said.\n\n“We wound up getting Greenland in a good spot. We have more control over Greenland than ever and we’re going to build up our Arctic defenses,” Graham added. “It’s fashionable now, it seems to be, in Republican circles to worry about what Trump said or somebody said in Trump world.\n\n“My advice would be, let’s keep governing well,” he said. “Let’s start prosecuting the case about how out-of-sync the Democrats are with the American people.”",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump touted the supposed strength of America on Super Bowl Sunday—as he watched the game from the comfort of his Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n“Enjoy the Super Bowl, America! Our Country is stronger, bigger, and better than ever before and, THE BEST IS YET TO COME!” he wrote in a Truth Social post on Sunday.\n\nTrump, who has been booed at myriad sporting events—including last year’s Super Bowl—wasn’t at Levi’s Stadium in Santa Clara, California. Instead, he attended a watch party at his private Mar-a-Lago golf club in Palm Beach, Florida.\n\nThe president had previously said he wanted to attend the game but that it was “just too far away.”\n\n“I would go if, you know, it was a little bit shorter,” he added.\n\nBut Zeteo learned that Trump’s officials and advisers were privately concerned about Trump getting booed at the biggest television event of the year. Last year’s event drew an estimated 127.7 million viewers, Nielsen reported, with similar numbers expected this year.\n\nViral clips of the president being loudly booed by tens of thousands of spectators would be “another thing we don’t want right now,” one Trump adviser told the outlet.\n\nBut even from thousands of miles away, the president still managed to court controversy as the Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots, 29-13.\n\nFor months, MAGA had been in full-on meltdown mode over the NFL’s choice of Puerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, 31, to headline the Super Bowl halftime performance.\n\nBorn Benito Martinez Ocasio, Bad Bunny was Spotify’s most-streamed artist of 2025 and made history at this year’s Grammy Awards when he won album of the year for his Spanish-language Debí Tirar Mas Fotos.\n\nHis halftime performance pulled from the Debí Tirar Mas Fotos world tour and celebrated Latin American culture beneath a billboard that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.”\n\nTrump called the performance a “slap in the face to our country.”\n\n“The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!” he complained in a Truth Social post. “It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence.”\n\nBut unlike his speech at the Grammy’s, Bad Bunny’s performance didn’t explicitly denounce the president’s immigration policy.\n\nInstead, he invited the audience to rejoice in the pan-American culture the Trump administration has demonized and even drove home his point about love and unity with an actual wedding.\n\nSome of the president’s own supporters worried about him taking such an aggressive stand against the show, considering the administration is hemorrhaging support among Latinos, Politico reported.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to the White House for comment.",

We have money set aside for our kids' college. Other than the primary residence, we have no debt. Can I quit/retire at 51? – Scott\n\nHi Scott, thanks for reading! You've provided a pretty clear picture of your resources, and I think most people with your assets and income sources would be able to comfortably retire at 51. But retirement is a highly specific undertaking. We really need to consider how your assets and income stack up against your individual needs before we can say whether or not you can retire. I'll walk you through how I see things and hopefully leave you with a better feeling of how to do that.\n\nNot sure when you can retire? A financial advisor can help you build a plan and stress-test it. Connect with an advisor for free.\n\nFor a simple illustration, imagine you walk up to me and show me that you can bend down, stretch and maybe even do a vertical jump. That gives me some feel for your physical fitness, right? But then you point to something out of my view and ask, “Can I pick that up?” Pick up what: a coffee mug, a suitcase, a bag of concrete?\n\nWith all of the information about your assets but none about your lifestyle spending needs, that's analogous to the situation we have here. You've given me a clear picture of your assets, but we don't yet have your lifestyle spending needs. What we can do, though, is get you in the ballpark of what I think you'd be capable of supporting. I think this will give you a good idea of where you stand based on your own understanding of your spending needs.\n\nEverything that follows from here can, and should, be tweaked depending on your preferences and details we don't have. However, I think this will get you close enough to make a reasonable estimate of how prepared you are to stop working.\n\n(And if you need additional help planning for retirement, consider working with a financial advisor.)\n\nSmartAsset and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue through links in the content below.",

    "description": "Family of Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong media tycoon and vocal critic of China's Communist rule, calls his prison sentence cruel, and the \"end of justice.\"",
    "fullText": "Hong Kong — Jimmy Lai, the pro-democracy former Hong Kong media tycoon and a fierce critic of Beijing, was sentenced on Monday to 20 years in prison in the longest punishment given so far under a China-imposed national security law that has virtually silenced the city's dissent.\n\n Lai, 78, was convicted in December of conspiring with others to collude with foreign forces to endanger national security, and conspiracy to publish seditious articles. The maximum penalty for his conviction was life imprisonment.\n\n His co-defendants, six former employees of his Apple Daily newspaper and two activists, received prison terms of between 6 years and 3 months, and 10 years on collusion-related charges.\n\n Lai smiled and waved at his supporters when he arrived for the sentence. But before he left the courtroom, he looked serious, as some people in the public gallery cried. When asked about whether they would appeal, his lawyer Robert Pang said no comment.\n\n The democracy advocate's arrest and trial have raised concerns about the decline of press freedom in what was once an Asian bastion of media independence. The government insists the case has nothing to do with a free press, saying the defendants used news reporting as a pretext for years to commit acts that harmed China and Hong Kong.\n\n Lai was one of the first prominent figures to be arrested under the security law in 2020. Within a year, some of Apple Daily's senior journalists also were arrested and the newspaper shut down in June 2021.\n\nFamily warns Lai \"will die a martyr behind bars\"\n\nIn a statement, Lai's son, Sebastien, said the \"draconian\" prison term was devastating for his family and life-threatening for his father. \"It signifies the total destruction of the Hong Kong legal system and the end of justice,\" he said.\n\nHis sister Claire called the sentence \"heartbreakingly cruel\" in the same statement. \"If this sentence is carried out, he will die a martyr behind bars,\" she said.\n\nLai has been in custody for more than five years already.\n\nIn January, his lawyer Pang said Lai suffered health issues including heart palpitations, high blood pressure and diabetes.\n\nThe prosecution said a medical report noted Lai's general health condition remained stable. The government claimed Lai had requested to be held in solitary confinement.\n\nLai's sentence condemned around the world\n\nLai's sentencing could heighten Beijing's diplomatic tension with foreign governments, which have criticized Lai's conviction and sentencing.\n\n President Trump, who is expected to visit China in April, said in December that he felt \"so badly\" after the verdict was handed down, and he noted that he had spoken with Chinese leader Xi Jinping about Lai and asked him \"to consider his release.\"\n\nIn a statement shared by the State Department on Monday, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio called the sentence \"an unjust and tragic conclusion to this case.\"\n\n\"It shows the world that Beijing will go to extraordinary lengths to silence those who advocate fundamental freedoms in Hong Kong,\" Rubio said, adding that \"after enduring a trial lasting two years, and detention in prison for more than five, Mr. Lai and his family have suffered enough. The United States urges the authorities to grant Mr. Lai humanitarian parole.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government also has called for the release of Lai, who is a British citizen. U.K. Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper called the prosecution \"politically motivated,\" saying the prison term is tantamount to a life sentence.\n\nHuman Rights Watch's Asia Director Elaine Pearson said the harsh 20-year-sentence is effectively a death sentence, calling it cruel and unjust.\n\nChinese leaders say Lai's sentence \"deeply gratifying\"\n\nHong Kong leader John Lee said Lai's sentence demonstrated the rule of law, calling the crimes he was convicted of \"heinous and evil in the extreme.\"\n\n The newspaper mogul's \"heavy sentence of 20 years' imprisonment demonstrates the rule of law, upholds justice and is deeply gratifying,\" Lee said in a statement.\n\nLin Jian, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry in Beijing, said Lai was \"a key planner and participant in a series of anti-China and disruptive activities in Hong Kong,\" and lauded the sentencing as \"reasonable, legitimate, and legal,\" adding: \"There is no room for argument.\"\n\nLin urged \"relevant countries\" to respect the rule of law in Hong Kong.\n\nLai prosecuted under China's broad new security law\n\nLai founded Apple Daily, a now-defunct newspaper known for its critical reports against the governments in Hong Kong and Beijing. He was arrested in August 2020 under the security law that was used in a yearslong crackdown on many of Hong Kong's leading activists.\n\n In their ruling, three government-vetted judges wrote that the starting point of Lai's sentence was increased because they found him to be the mastermind of the conspiracies. But they also reduced his penalty because they accepted that Lai's age, health condition and solitary confinement would cause his prison life to be more burdensome than that of other inmates.\n\n \"Lai was no doubt the mastermind of all three conspiracies charged and therefore he warrants a heavier sentence,\" they said. \"As regards the others, it is difficult to distinguish their relative culpability.\"\n\n They took into account that Lai is serving a prison term of five years and nine months in a separate fraud case and ruled that 18 years of Lai's sentence in the security case should be served consecutively to that prison term.\n\nA chilling effect on China's journalists and academics\n\nUrania Chiu, lecturer in law at Oxford Brookes University, said the case is significant for its broad construction of seditious intent and application of the term \"collusion with foreign forces\" to certain activities by the media. The implication is particularly alarming for journalists and those working in academia, she said.\n\n \"Offering and publishing legitimate critiques of the state, which often involves engagement with international platforms and audiences, may now easily be construed as 'collusion,'\" Chiu said.\n\n The former Apple Daily staffers and activists involved in Lai's case entered guilty pleas, which helped reduce their sentences Monday. They earlier admitted to the prosecution charge that said they conspired with Lai to request foreign forces to impose sanctions or blockades, or engage in other hostile activities against Hong Kong or China.\n\n The convicted journalists are publisher Cheung Kim-hung, associate publisher Chan Pui-man, editor-in-chief Ryan Law, executive editor-in-chief Lam Man-chung, executive editor-in-chief responsible for English news Fung Wai-kong and editorial writer Yeung Ching-kee. They received prison terms ranging between six years and nine months, to 10 years.\n\n The two activists, Andy Li and Chan Tsz-wah, were sentenced to six years and three months, and seven years and three months respectively.\n\n The penalties for Cheung, Chan and Yeung, alongside the two activists, were reduced in part because they served as prosecution witnesses and the judges said their evidence had \"significantly\" contributed to the conviction of Lai.\n\n Before sunrise, dozens of people stood in line outside the court building to secure a seat in the courtroom. One of them was former Apple Daily employee Tammy Cheung.\n\n \"Whatever happens, it's an end — at least we'll know the outcome,\" Cheung said before the sentence was delivered.\n\n Lai founded Apple Daily in 1995, two years before the former British colony returned to Chinese rule. Its closure in 2021 shocked the local press scene. Hong Kong ranked 140th out of 180 territories in the press-freedom index compiled by media freedom organization Reporters Without Borders in 2025, far from its 18th place in 2002.\n\nOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn crashes seconds into race\n\nShock over Lindsey Vonn's Olympic crash; Trump calls Hunter Hess a loser for comments on politics\n\nMore details emerge on whistleblower complaint against Tulsi Gabbard",

    "fullText": "The White House dropped an AI-generated video in the middle of the Super Bowl featuring a British-sounding narrator touting the Trump administration’s “unapologetically American” style. The 30-second video opens with a sweeping shot of a football stadium as Air Force One passes overhead, prompting astonished reactions from two digitally rendered fans wearing Patriots and Seahawks gear. “We don’t do subtle,” the narrator says at the outset. The scene then shifts inside the aircraft, where a voice announces that the plane is “flying over the Gulf of America.” A screeching eagle sound effect follows as the video rapidly transitions to the White House, cutting through a montage of President Donald Trump signing executive orders. “We bet on ourselves and don’t apologize for winning,” the narrator continues.",

    "description": "Laid-off tech workers are blaming AI for the loss of their jobs, but connecting the dots on how it led to their firing isn't always clear.",
    "fullText": "That's the question laid-off workers are grappling with in the aftermath of losing their jobs. The No. 1 suspect is often artificial intelligence, but connecting the dots on how that led to their firing isn't always clear.\n\nJacob Zinkula has spoken to dozens of laid-off workers who are trying to piece together why they were let go.\n\nSome might deem those efforts fruitless. (Congrats on figuring it out! You're still unemployed.)\n\nA better understanding helps inform the next career move, and plenty of people could use that. This January saw more layoffs than any January since 2009.\n\nFurther muddying the waters is companies' reluctance to say AI drives layoffs. When Amazon made its first round of deep cuts last fall, many speculated it was due to AI. But CEO Andy Jassy said it was about \"culture,\" not AI or costs.\n\nIt's one thing to lose your job because of tech. It's another to hear you don't have the personality for it.\n\nThe way I see it, AI impacts layoffs in three main ways.\n\nAI took my job: While the most direct, it's also the least common these days. There aren't many examples of AI doing everything a human can at work. In most cases, there's still a need for some human interaction.\n\nAs much as it stinks to lose your job this way, at least it's a clear sign you need to change what you're doing. AI isn't coming for your job. It's already here.\n\nAI makes my job a lot easier: This applies to just about everyone. AI can't automate everything you do, but it can sure carry a lot of the load. At first glance, that seems like a good thing. But if AI enables you to do more with less, your company has the same benefit.\n\nSure, some will position it as an opportunity to supercharge their employees to drive more business. The more likely outcome is that this is an opportunity to reduce headcount.\n\nThe silver lining is that your job is still needed. There are just fewer opportunities out there, and you need to get really good at managing AI to get them.\n\nWe need to pay for this AI somehow: The most frustrating of the three. AI isn't directly impacting your job at all, but those tech bills aren't going to pay themselves. If you fall into this bucket, chances are you weren't driving a ton of revenue for the firm. (After all, why kill a cash cow when money is tight?)\n\nIt's a hard pill to swallow. However, it could serve as a wake-up call for how you approach your next gig. Like it or not, AI is the way forward for most companies. So if you're not helping a business reach that goal, you might need to reconsider what you're doing in the first place.",

However, many of the private fliers may have been attending parties in the area instead.\n\nThe exodus included Kim Kardashian's Gulfstream G650, which costs $65 million to buy new. The plane is registered to an LLC that shares its address with several companies owned by Kardashian and her family.\n\nKardashian was pictured at Levi's Stadium alongside Lewis Hamilton, the F1 driver whom she is rumored to be dating.\n\nHer plane took off about two hours after the game ended and flew to Van Nuys Airport in Los Angeles, according to ADS-B Exchange flight-tracking data.\n\nJay-Z and Beyoncé's Bombardier Global 7500 left just under an hour after the game, and also went to Van Nuys Airport. The jet's registered owner is a holding company that shares its address with Jay-Z's Roc Nation.\n\nIt was the most popular destination, with 15 of the 95 jets flying there. Another 14 flew from the Bay Area to Las Vegas airports.\n\nThree of the 95 airplanes were still airborne at the time of publishing this article.\n\nThat included a Gulfstream G650 owned by Nike, which was flying over the Atlantic Ocean. Another one, with an Argentine tail number, was heading toward South America.\n\nThe vast majority of the other 92 private jets flew to cities within the US, but one went to Vancouver and another to Toluca, in Mexico.\n\nThe Super Bowl is one of the most popular events for private fliers.\n\nAccording to data from JetSpy, which tracks US-registered airplanes, 914 business jets arrived in the Bay Area between Wednesday and Saturday.\n\nWhile many would not be traveling for the Super Bowl, JetSpy data showed that Friday, the most popular day for arrivals, saw nearly 90% more business jets than usual.",

Five days on, and around 4,700 supporters have donated over $520,000 to this page.\n\nThe GoFundMe, which launched just a few hours after company executives began cutting workers, was organized by Post reporter Rachel Siegel and other members of the newsroom's union.\n\nA separate GoFundMe page for the Post's international employees has also raised almost $200,000 with about 2,100 donations.\n\nAccording to the newsroom's union, the cut has affected hundreds of jobs at the organization.\n\nA spokesperson for The Washington Post told Business Insider that it \"is actively supporting employees impacted by last week's restructuring, including transition support for our international employees.\"\n\nPost owner and Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos, has drawn significant criticism over his stewardship of the company in the last few days. In a statement this weekend, he said: \"The Post has an essential journalistic mission and an extraordinary opportunity.\"\n\n\"Each and every day our readers give us a roadmap to success. The data tells us what is valuable and where to focus.\"\n\nKara Swisher, the tech journalist and ex-Post employee, gave $10,000 to the page set up for laid-off staff.\n\nThe former Washington Post executive editor, Martin Baron, appeared to have donated $9,000 in total, comprising $4,000 for the international staff GoFundMe and $5,000 for the general one.\n\nOther top donors appeared to include longtime former and current staffers Dan Balz, Eugene Robinson, and Lois Romano.\n\nBusiness Insider's Dan Whateley and Sydney Bradley previously reported that the amount of money in the fundraisers and the speed at which they hit six figures make them outliers among media layoff fundraisers.\n\nLaid-off staffers at Vox Media pulled in about $7,000 in their January GoFundMe, while Teen Vogue got about $41,000 after November layoffs.\n\n\"Post Guild members have come together to support their colleagues with this GoFundMe,\" said a spokesperson for the Washington Baltimore News Guild last week.\n\nThe spokesperson blamed \"inexcusable business decisions of top Post leadership\" for the cuts.\n\n\"The Washington Post is taking a number of difficult but decisive actions today for our future, in what amounts to a significant restructuring across the company,\" a Post spokesperson said last week in a statement on the layoffs.\n\n\"These steps are designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus on delivering the distinctive journalism that sets The Post apart and, most importantly, engages our customers.\"",

The valuation was not disclosed.\n\n\"I think that third-party risk management was the neglected child of cybersecurity for a very long time,\" Eddie Dovzhik, Lema's co-founder and CEO, told Business Insider. \"A problem of this magnitude deserves a solution that actually solves the problem.\"\n\nCybersecurity startups raised nearly $14 billion in 2025, according to Pinpoint Search Group. That was a 47% increase from 2024 and the best year since 2021.\n\nLema was founded in 2023 by Dovzhik, Omer Yehudai, and Tomer Roizman. They had all left other cybersecurity companies, knowing they wanted to start something new, but not exactly sure what to focus on.\n\n\"We started the long and tedious ideation process,\" said Dovzhik. \"We were looking for a major problem, something that had a huge impact on businesses that the current solutions were not addressing.\"\n\nThey landed on third-party risk management, an area they thought was traditionally overlooked as companies increasingly depend on thousands of external vendors, from cloud providers to SaaS tools to AI startups, many of which have deep access to sensitive systems and data.\n\n60% of companies now rely on over 1,000 external vendors, according to Gartner. And nearly one-third of recent cyber breaches originated with third parties, according to McKinsey & Company.\n\n\"The overall number of third parties has increased dramatically in the past few years,\" Dovzhik said. \"Everybody is now onboarding all these new AI third parties that behave in a completely different way and pose a completely different type of risk.\"\n\nDovzhik pointed to recent high-profile incidents involving third parties, including last year's Coinbase breach that impacted nearly 70,000 users and a 2024 CrowdStrike outage that crippled the websites of airlines, hospitals, and banks.\n\nMost companies still rely on spreadsheets and checklists to track third parties, while Lema harnesses AI to help companies better understand where they are most at risk, according to Dovzhik.\n\n\"We built an AI agent that thinks like a vulnerability researcher,\" Dovzhik said. \"Our goal was to come up with a completely different solution that completely changes the way that third-party risk management is being done.\"",

    "description": "Eddie Bauer retail and outlet stores in the United States and Canada will remain open for now as the company begins shutting down certain stores.",
    "fullText": "The operating entity behind Eddie Bauer's North American stores has officially filed for bankruptcy.\n\nEddie Bauer LLC, an entity of retail holding company Catalyst Brands, which licenses the rights to operate Eddie Bauer stores across the United States and Canada, filed for Chapter 11 in federal bankruptcy court in New Jersey on Monday.\n\nThe move puts the iconic American outdoor apparel chain's nearly 200 stores throughout the US and Canada at risk of closure.\n\nUnder the Chapter 11 restructuring plan, the company said it will conduct liquidation sales at Eddie Bauer stores \"while continuing to pursue an ongoing sale process\" of all or part of the store operating business in North America.\n\nA potential sale could keep the North American business operations up and running instead of a complete wind-down, the company said.\n\nIf no buyer emerges, the retailer is expected to close down its stores across North America.\n\nIn the meantime, Eddie Bauer retail and outlet stores in the US and Canada will remain open as the company begins shutting down certain stores, the company said.\n\nThe retailer has been \"in a challenged situation, with declining sales, supply chain challenges and other issues\" since before the creation of Catalyst Brands last year, Marc Rosen, the CEO of Catalyst Brands, said in a statement.\n\n\"Over the past year, these challenges have been exacerbated by various headwinds, including increased costs of doing business due to inflation, ongoing tariff uncertainty, and other factors,\" he said.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing said that Eddie Bauer LLC has more than 100,000 creditors. The company listed its estimated assets at $100 million to $500 million and its estimated liabilities at $1 billion to $10 billion.\n\nThe Chapter 11 filing does not affect Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, wholesale, or e-commerce operations, nor its retail business outside the US and Canada. Japan is home to several Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nLast month, Authentic Brands Group, which owns the Eddie Bauer brand and IP worldwide, announced that it was transitioning the licenses for Eddie Bauer's manufacturing, e-commerce, and wholesale operations in North America from Catalyst to Outdoor 5.\n\nThe Eddie Bauer brand, one of the oldest in American outdoor apparel, has built its reputation on durable, innovative gear and clothing designed to withstand extreme conditions.\n\nIt was founded in Seattle in 1920 by outdoorsman Eddie Bauer, who two decades later patented the first quilted goose-down jacket in the country after a near-fatal experience with hypothermia.\n\nThe brand has dealt with Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings twice before, first in 2003 when its then-parent company, Spiegel, filed for bankruptcy. Eddie Bauer emerged from that bankruptcy two years later as a stand-alone company.\n\nFacing mounting debt, the retailer filed for Chapter 11 in 2009 and was acquired by private equity firm Golden Gate Capital later that year through a bankruptcy auction.\n\nIn 2021, Eddie Bauer was acquired by Authentic Brands Group, in partnership with SPARC Group (which has since become Catalyst Brands).",

    "description": "Previously, entry-level PwC consultants in the US could start their careers in any of 72 office locations. Now, that's down to 13.",
    "fullText": "PwC is cutting down the number of US locations where entry-level consultants can start their careers with the firm.\n\nThe Big Four firm has limited hiring for new associates in the advisory division to 13 offices, Yolanda Seals-Coffield, chief people and inclusion officer for PwC US, told Business Insider in an interview.\n\nPreviously, entry-level consulting hires could join any of PwC's 72 US office locations. But since fall 2025, advisory associates have been assigned to one of 13 offices, which include key markets like New York, San Francisco, and Washington, DC.\n\nTax and assurance recruits can still apply to all of PWC's US offices, a firm spokesperson told Business Insider.\n\n\"The idea is that we want to bring people together in a connected way for those first couple of years,\" she said. PwC declined to provide the list of locations that will continue to hire entry-level consultants.\n\nThe isolation of the COVID years, combined with the way that AI is changing the nature of work, has chipped away at some of PwC's sense of connection around learning and development, especially for younger employees, said Seals-Coffield.\n\n\"You may start in Atlanta and then say, great, I've got my two years of experience. I want to go work in Alabama, which is where I'm from and where I really want to work,\" said Seals-Coffield.\n\nLimiting the number of offices they can join will not impact overall hiring numbers, a PwC spokesperson told Business Insider. The firm continues to evaluate hiring goals annually to account for business needs and considerations, they added.\n\nThe decision to bring consultants together in their first years in the firm is part of PwC's broader push towards collaborative learning.\n\nOn Thursday, the firm launched the Learning Collective, a new workplace learning strategy focused on everyday, collaborative knowledge-sharing and developing the mix of human and AI skills needed for the future.\n\n\"Getting our people to spend more time together, learning and growing in an intentional way, is the goal of the experience,\" she added.\n\nUpskilling the workforce for the AI future has become a top priority across all industries, but the pressure is particularly acute among the Big Four professional services firms and other consulting leaders such as McKinsey and Boston Consulting Group because of how rapidly the new technology is changing the nature of the work they do.\n\nStraight advisory projects are being replaced with building, implementing, and maintaining tools for companies, requiring technology expertise over research skills. As consultants begin working with AI agents, they also need to sharpen their \"human\" skills, such as empathy and critical thinking.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Regulators in China want banks to dial back their holdings of US Treasury bonds.\n\nThe move, reported by Bloomberg on Monday, is likely to fuel fresh talk about the \"sell America\" trade and the appeal of the dollar. Chinese authorities cited concentration risk and volatility in US debt markets as the reasons for scaling back.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, Chinese banks have been urged to limit new purchases, while those with high exposure have been told to dial back their investments.\n\nTreasury yields, which move inversely to prices, were slightly higher on Monday morning. The dollar dropped more sharply, with the Dollar Index down almost 1% on the news. The fresh dip in the greenback follows its recent decline to four-year lows.\n\nWhile the report notes that the regulators framed the directive around financial stability, rather than geopolitical maneuvering, it's likely to spur more debate in the market about countries' willingness to keep lending to the US.\n\nThe \"sell America\" trade, in which investors dump dollar-denominated assets from stocks to Treasurys, was a focal point of markets last year. It's been fueled by a combination of fiscal concerns amid record-high US debt and deficit spending, as well as weaker trust in US institutions amid threats to central bank independence and ongoing tariff threats. It's also been a force behind the debasement trade, which has boosted gold and other metals in the last year.\n\nBloomberg added that regulators did not specify how much exposure they believe Chinese banks should have to US debt at this time.\n\nData from the State Administration of Foreign Exchange shows that as of September 2025, Chinese banks collectively held $298 billion in US dollar-denominated bonds, but it's not clear how much of that is US Treasury debt.\n\nDonald Trump and Chinese leader Xi Jinping spoke by phone last week, and could meet in Beijing in April.",

    "description": "A sixth grade math teacher explains how TikTok helped her engage students, support parents, and build a massive following beyond the classroom.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Deidre Kelly. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nThis is my 14th year teaching sixth-grade math, and I enjoy it just as much as I did when I started. Math and middle schoolers both get a bad reputation, but I love them both.\n\nI always knew I wanted to teach math, and I gravitated toward sixth grade, where students develop the time management and accountability skills that they'll use for the rest of their lives.\n\nBack in 2019, I noticed in the fall that my students were laughing at their phones and dancing around their desks. I thought, \"What are ya'll doing?\" By January, I had a TikTok account and was making videos with my own three kids, who are now 11, 13, and 16.\n\nWhen our district switched to remote learning, most of my formal class time with my students was focused on making sure they were doing OK. I still wanted to teach them, so I started making fun, math-focused TikTok videos.\n\nAt first, I posted the videos quietly. I was curious if I would show up in my students' pages organically. Sure enough, a student asked, \"Why are you on my 'for me' page?\" From there, it spread quickly. Today, I have 1.3 million followers on TikTok.\n\nThat's made me a bit of a local celebrity in my Texas school district. Recently, kids were watching YouTube in another class when they came across a TikTok commercial featuring me. They came running down the hall to tell me.\n\nIt's fun for students and parents to have \"The Mrs. Kelly\" live in their classroom. My class has the same fun, energetic vibe that I bring to social media. But, there's always a point during the year where the students realize I'm not just a fun TikTok teacher — if the class isn't focused, I can use my mean voice to get things done.\n\nI typically keep notes on videos I want to make and spend a few hours in my classroom recording after school each week. I aim to align my TikTok videos with what my students are learning, so they appear the day after I teach a concept.\n\nThat's helpful not only for students but also for parents and grandparents. I use math at work every day, so I didn't realize how many adults have forgotten middle school math. Today, a lot of my audience is adults who need a math refresher so they can help with homework.\n\nI've never had any pushback about having such a public social media presence. I let parents know about my videos, but I've never had anyone opt out of their kids participating. I'm careful to stay positive and appropriate at all times. My husband is an attorney, so if I run an idea by him and he hesitates, I don't do it. If I don't know a song well, I check with my oldest to make sure it doesn't have any risqué lyrics.\n\nWhen I switched schools, I made sure the principal knew I brought a large social following. Now, even the superintendent loves it.\n\nBecause of my husband's job, our family has always been financially comfortable, even though my teaching salary isn't the best. Now, TikTok has had a big impact on our budget. For the first time, I have the financial flexibility to say, \"I've got this.\" I also appreciate the travel and opportunities I've had because of my social media.\n\nI want to encourage parents to help their kids relate math to the real world. Connect it to whatever they're interested in. For my sixth-grade daughter, that's makeup. So, when we shop at Sephora, we talk about percentages and discounts. Maybe you relate ratios to sports statistics, or your kids' favorite video games. That will help them really understand the real-world impact of what they're learning and remember math concepts for life.",

    "fullText": "LIVIGNO, Italy (AP) — Chloe Kim and Eileen Gu, two Olympic standouts who have faced their share of hate over the years, each weighed in Monday on Donald Trump's bashing of their friend, American freeskier Hunter Hess, for having said he didn't back the U.S. president's heightened crackdown on immigrants.\n\n“I think in moments like these, it is really important for us to unite and kind of stand up for one another for all that’s going on,\" said Kim, the two-time Olympic gold medalist whose parents are South Korean immigrants and who has faced racism throughout her career for her Asian heritage.\n\nGu, the American-born freeskier who competes for China, said after her silver-medal win in slopestyle that she had been in touch with Hess, who told her she was one of the few people who could relate to what he's going through.\n\n“As someone who’s been caught in the crossfire before, I feel sorry for the athletes,” said Gu, who was born in San Francisco and whose decision to compete for China turned her into a lightning rod.\n\nHess drew Trump’s ire when he was asked by reporters to give his views on the immigration crackdown that has claimed the lives of two protestors in Minnesota and disrupted thousands of lives of immigrants and U.S. citizens. Hess answered: “Just because I’m wearing the flag doesn’t mean I represent everything that’s going on in the U.S.”\n\nThe next day, Trump lashed out at Hess on his Truth Social account, calling him “a real Loser” and saying he would be hard pressed to root for him at the Games. Hess's friends — snowboarders and freeskiers competing this week in Livigno — were asked for their reaction.\n\n“My parents being immigrants from Korea, this one definitely hits pretty close to home,” said Kim, who begins defense of her title Wednesday.\n\n\"I’m really proud to represent the United States,” she said. “The U.S. has given my family and I so much opportunity, but I also think that we are allowed to voice our opinions of what’s going that we need to lead with love and compassion.”\n\nOther American snowboarders spoke out for diversity and the right of expression.\n\n“I think there are a lot of different opinions in the U.S. right now. Obviously we’re very divided,” snowboarder Bea Kim said. “I personally am very proud to represent the United States. That being said, I think diversity is what makes us a very strong country and what makes that so special.”\n\nTeammate Maddie Mastro added: “I’m also saddened with what’s happening at home.\"\n\n“It’s really tough and I feel like we can’t turn a blind eye to that. But at the same time, I represent a country that has the same values as mine of kindness and compassion. And we come together in times of injustice,” Mastro said.\n\nGu called it “an unwinnable press war” for Hess and lamented the fact that the controversy could be a distraction for the athletes, and overshadow the beauty of the biggest event in winter sports.\n\n“I’m sorry that the headline that is eclipsing the Olympics has to be something so ... unrelated to the spirit of the Games,\" she said. \"It really runs contrary to everything that the Olympics should be.”\n\nAP Winter Olympics: https://apnews.com/hub/milan-cortina-2026-winter-olympics",

    "description": "Ukraine is teaching its partners what's needed for large-scale drone warfare, including what it takes to get pilots ready.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian soldiers advised an elite British unit on how to train troops for drone warfare.\n\nThey said about 60 hours of flying is needed to reach competence.\n\nThey advised that pilots should start on a simulator. The US Army also uses one on Ukrainian advice.\n\nUkrainian troops taught the British Army what it takes to get soldiers up to speed on drone flying. Sixty hours is typically the minimum requirement for pilot competence, a senior British officer said.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, an elite British Army infantry regiment, told Business Insider that the Ukrainians said a decent pilot needs at least 30 hours on a simulator and 30 hours of actual flying in the field.\n\nAt about 60 hours, \"they are pretty competent at being able to fly different types of drones,\" he said. After that, improvement comes with repetition and exposure to more systems. \"It's an upward curve in terms of how good they can get,\" he said. It takes practice.\n\nThe battalion received those lessons while it was helping train Ukrainian troops for their fight against Russia's invasion. The unit was deployed in support of Operation Interflex, the UK-led effort with 13 other countries to train Ukrainian soldiers in Western and NATO-style fighting.\n\nAs Western forces train Ukrainian troops, Ukrainian soldiers with front-line experience have also been sharing lessons with their international partners, particularly in areas where NATO militaries have limited recent combat exposure, like small drone operations.\n\nThe US Army has also been learning from Ukraine about the value of simulators in drone training. Its Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course at Fort Rucker, Alabama — designed to help the service catch up on drone warfare — uses simulated flight training before soldiers progress to live drones, Maj. Wolf Amacker, chief of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Army's Aviation Center of Excellence , told Business Insider.\n\nWestern militaries have much deeper institutional expertise across many forms of warfare, but they haven't fought a war quite like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a large-scale, tech- and drone-saturated industrial conflict. They have fought heavy artillery battles and engaged in trench warfare, but it's been decades. Ukrainian troops coming through Western training often have more recent experience.\n\nOn small drones in particular, Ukraine has tremendous experience, far more than its partners. Drones have been used \n\nIrwin-Clark said Ukraine's fight was what pushed his battalion to go all-in on drones, calling them part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nSeventy-eight of the battalion's 300 members are now pilots or instructors. The unit has built a \"drone hub\" where soldiers can make and repair drones and train on them. Irwin-Clark described it as the first of its kind in the British Army, saying, \"No other unit in the British Army has one of these yet.\"\n\nHe added that when it came to learning drone warfare, \"I was surprised by how quickly people picked it up.\"\n\nThe battalion has also made other changes based on Ukrainian advice, including adding anti-drone nets to training and using 3D printing to quickly and cheaply produce drone parts.\n\nOther Western militaries are seeking similar guidance. Poland and Norway have looked to Ukraine for help training operators, while Ukrainian specialists have traveled to Denmark to participate in counter-drone exercises.\n\nUkrainian drone schools training operators for the war have previously told Business Insider that their instruction draws almost entirely on Ukrainian battlefield experience, not lessons from Western partners, reflecting how far ahead the country is of its allies in practical drone warfare knowledge.",

    "description": "Even in her 80s, my mother-in-law has found ways to stay fulfilled, social, and happy while making friends and traveling. Here's what she's taught me.",
    "fullText": "For as long as I've known her, my mother-in-law Elizabeth has reminded me of Auntie Mame, that wonderfully eccentric and eclectic character who was always embarking on new adventures and having fun with friends.\n\nEven at 84, Elizabeth continues to thrive socially and hasn't let age or any physical setbacks diminish her zest for life.\n\nLike the lovable Auntie Mame, she's an enduring example of how fun it can be to make new connections, keep an open mind, and stay curious at any age.\n\nOver the years, I've learned a lot from my mother-in-law. Here are some of her guiding principles or \"secrets\" to thriving socially and enjoying a life well-lived.\n\nElizabeth loves to learn, especially so she always has something new and exciting to talk about with others.\n\nI can typically find her reading a new book, listening to a podcast, or watching YouTube videos about natural health, ancient history, spirituality, art, travel, astronomy, time travel, extraterrestrials … the list goes on. She makes me laugh because nothing's off the table.\n\nOver the years, she has also studied various religious and spiritual practices, and she prides herself on having friends with different cultural backgrounds and worldviews.\n\nFrom Buddhism, Christianity, and Judaism to Sufism, Hinduism, and diverse Native American spiritual traditions, she gleans wisdom from numerous perspectives and sees the connective tissue among them.\n\nShe's stayed open to meeting new people, too, and has told me its especially fun and invigorating to learn about what younger generations are into. These days, many of her friends are in their 50s and 60s.\n\n\"Life is too short to keep your mind closed,\" she'll tell me.\n\nElizabeth is big on quotes, and one of her favorites is often attributed to Ralph Waldo Emerson, though its exact origin is unclear.\n\nIt's about how the purpose of a life is \"to be useful, to be honorable, to be compassionate, to have it make some difference that you have lived and lived well.\"\n\nShe's done this throughout her life, and continues to do so today. For example, in 2012, after many decades as a successful business owner and fundraiser for children's charities, she cofounded Child Safe Michigan, a non-profit for adoption, mentoring, and foster care.\n\nAs an adopted child herself, this was an incredibly personal endeavor and she's enjoyed helping others for many years. Even though my mother-in-law is retired now, she continues to support the organization and other causes she believes in.\n\nShe's always socializing, making new contacts, and spending time with others who have similar passions for helping others and making a positive difference in their communities.\n\nAlthough my mom-in-law is still young at heart and in overall good health, hip issues and arthritis can be a pain. However, a natural extrovert, she doesn't let these things stop her from moving around and being social.\n\nShe still drives herself wherever she needs to be and stays busy going on breakfast, lunch, or dinner dates with friends; attending church functions; and checking out new museum exhibits.\n\nIf she's doing more extensive travel, she figures out whatever accommodations she may need to make her trip a success. For example, when spending the winter in Maui with her daughter, she made plans to have wheelchair assistance through the airport.\n\nShe also loves going on road trips and on boat rides, especially when we visit Northern Michigan together.\n\nUltimately, though, Elizabeth reminds me of how important it is to see the world and appreciate all that's around us — even if we're just in our own backyards.",

    "fullText": "That's the question that both Kalshi and Polymarket had to confront on Sunday night, after rapper Cardi B appeared at the Super Bowl halftime show as part of Bad Bunny's set.\n\nCardi B had no singing role, though she could clearly be seen dancing and mouthing words alongside singer Karol G and actors Pedro Pascal and Jessica Alba.\n\nIn layman's terms, it was obviously more of a cameo than a full-on performance.\n\nBut with millions of dollars at stake — Polymarket bettors had wagered more than $4.4 million on whether she would perform — precision matters.\n\nUltimately, it came down to interpreting the rules.\n\npedro pascal, cardi b, karol g & jessica alba make a surprise appearance during bad bunny’s super bowl halftime show \n pic.twitter.com/OYQlkyYjaZ\n\nPolymarket has decided that it did count as a performance, though that decision has been disputed and is set for a final review later this week.\n\nAccording to Polymarket's rules, the betting market would resolve to \"Yes\" simply if Cardi B \"performs live and in person\" during the show.\n\nWith Kalshi, things were less clear.\n\nAccording to the full rules for the betting market, an appearance counts as a performance if the following three conditions are met:\n\nHowever, the rules also lay out criteria for what does not count as an appearance. One of those was: \"Dancing or appearing on stage without singing/playing instruments.\"\n\nDue to the apparent lack of clarity, Kalshi invoked a rule that gives the platform sole discretion to settle contracts when there's an ambiguity not addressed by the rules.\n\nKalshi spokeswoman Elisabeth Diana told Business Insider in an email that the platform chose to settle the market at the last traded price, because Cardi B \"was at the very least mouthing the words when dancing,\" but it's unclear \"if she was singing,\" and it's \"impossible to tell either way.\"\n\nThat means those who bet on Kalshi that Cardi B would perform were paid out 26 cents per share, while those who bet that she wouldn't were paid 74 cents per share.\n\nSome commenters online and in the comments of Kalshi's prediction market appeared to be furious with the move.\n\nThe episode underscores one potential pitfall for prediction markets, particularly as they pitch themselves as reliable sources for knowledge about future events.",

    "description": "Ukraine is teaching its partners what's needed for large-scale drone warfare, including what it takes to get pilots ready.",
    "fullText": "Ukrainian troops taught the British Army what it takes to get soldiers up to speed on drone flying. Sixty hours is typically the minimum requirement for pilot competence, a senior British officer said.\n\nLt. Col. Ben Irwin-Clark, the commanding officer of the 1st Battalion of the Irish Guards, an elite British Army infantry regiment, told Business Insider that the Ukrainians said a decent pilot needs at least 30 hours on a simulator and 30 hours of actual flying in the field.\n\nAt about 60 hours, \"they are pretty competent at being able to fly different types of drones,\" he said. After that, improvement comes with repetition and exposure to more systems. \"It's an upward curve in terms of how good they can get,\" he said. It takes practice.\n\nThe battalion received those lessons while it was helping train Ukrainian troops for their fight against Russia's invasion. The unit was deployed in support of Operation Interflex, the UK-led effort with 13 other countries to train Ukrainian soldiers in Western and NATO-style fighting.\n\nAs Western forces train Ukrainian troops, Ukrainian soldiers with front-line experience have also been sharing lessons with their international partners, particularly in areas where NATO militaries have limited recent combat exposure, like small drone operations.\n\nThe US Army has also been learning from Ukraine about the value of simulators in drone training. Its Unmanned Advanced Lethality Course at Fort Rucker, Alabama — designed to help the service catch up on drone warfare — uses simulated flight training before soldiers progress to live drones, Maj. Wolf Amacker, chief of the Unmanned Aircraft Systems and Tactics Branch at the Army's Aviation Center of Excellence, told Business Insider.\n\nWestern militaries have much deeper institutional expertise across many forms of warfare, but they haven't fought a war quite like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a large-scale, tech- and drone-saturated industrial conflict. They have fought heavy artillery battles and engaged in trench warfare, but it's been decades. Ukrainian troops coming through Western training often have more recent experience.\n\nOn small drones in particular, Ukraine has tremendous experience, far more than its partners. Drones have been used \n\nIrwin-Clark said Ukraine's fight was what pushed his battalion to go all-in on drones, calling them part of \"the future of warfare.\"\n\nSeventy-eight of the battalion's 300 members are now pilots or instructors. The unit has built a \"drone hub\" where soldiers can make and repair drones and train on them. Irwin-Clark described it as the first of its kind in the British Army, saying, \"No other unit in the British Army has one of these yet.\"\n\nHe added that when it came to learning drone warfare, \"I was surprised by how quickly people picked it up.\"\n\nThe battalion has also made other changes based on Ukrainian advice, including adding anti-drone nets to training and using 3D printing to quickly and cheaply produce drone parts.\n\nOther Western militaries are seeking similar guidance. Poland and Norway have looked to Ukraine for help training operators, while Ukrainian specialists have traveled to Denmark to participate in counter-drone exercises.\n\nUkrainian drone schools training operators for the war have previously told Business Insider that their instruction draws almost entirely on Ukrainian battlefield experience, not lessons from Western partners, reflecting how far ahead the country is of its allies in practical drone warfare knowledge.",

    "description": "BofA strategists flagged earnings growth, C-suite sentiment, AI spending, and layoffs among their top takeaways from the latest results.",
    "fullText": "Earnings season is winding down, and some key takeaways for investors have emerged from the results.\n\nThe latest batch of financials has been largely upbeat, though there's lingering caution around things like AI capex plans from the biggest tech firms. Amazon, for instance, saw shares plunge after earnings last week as its spending plans shocked investors.\n\nYet, for the most part, Bank of America says that results have largely delivered despite lingering background noise about the AI arms race.\n\nWith about 75% of S&P 500 companies reporting, here are what BofA analysts say are the big takeaways for investors from fourth-quarter earnings season.\n\nGrowth is stronger than expected and above historic averages, but has stumbled on a quarter-over-quarter basis.\n\nNearly 70% of companies delivered earnings per share that beat consensus estimates, compared to the historical average of 60%. In the prior quarter, the beat rate was 75%, the strongest figure since 2021.\n\nSales for the companies that have reported so far are also strong. Bank of America noted that revenue excluding the financials and energy sectors is on pace for the highest year-over-year growth since 2022.\n\nBank of America's predictive analytics team examined earnings calls to assess sentiment among company executives. They found that positive corporate sentiment hit a record high.\n\n\"Corporate sentiment is tracking at a record high in 4Q, just above its pre-Liberation Day level. \"Weak demand\" mentions ticked higher but are still well below 2023-2024 levels.\"\n\nThey highlighted the tech and healthcare sectors as having the strongest guidance, while real estate and consumer staples were the weakest.\n\nAs expected, AI was a key focus for Wall Street this earnings season, especially amid AI disruption fears that are fueling volatility and investors' concerns about the return on colossal capex.\n\nHyper scalers' AI spending guidance came in 35% above Wall Street's expectations. Amazon plans to spend $200 billion this year, while Alphabet and Meta expect to spend up to $185 billion and $135 billion, respectively.\n\nThe strategists said that hyperscalers' capex guidance is decelerating year over year, but noted that 2025 capex was revised up by a \"whopping\" 30% from initial guidance.\n\nAmazon was punished by investors after it revealed its spending plans, with the stock plummeting after earnings. Other Big Tech names, however, fared better. Meta's capex outlook was offset by strength in its ad business, proving that investors can get comfortable with high AI spending if they like what they see elsewhere.\n\nJob cuts in January hit the highest point since 2009. Despite some worrying headlines about layoffs at high-profile companies like Amazon, Bank of America highlighted some \"less pessimistic\" readings into the labor market.\n\nThe strategists said that the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) layoff rate holds low, though hiring has fallen off — a low-hire, low-fire state.\n\nThey also noted that \"layoff\" mentions did tick up, but they see minimal evidence that AI is meaningfully weakening labor demand.",

    "fullText": "First, there were collars, then there were microchips. Now, we're using doorbell cameras to track down lost dogs.\n\nRing, Amazon's smart doorbell security system, launched Search Party, an AI system that helps locate lost dogs, last fall. In its first three months, the feature has brought home 99 lost dogs in just 90 days, according to Amazon CEO Andy Jassy.\n\n\"Good example of real-world impact, and proud of what the Ring team has built here,\" Jassy wrote.\n\nRing ran a heartstring-tugging ad about Search Party during the Super Bowl. In it, a family finds their lost dog Milo, thanks to the company's tech.\n\nSome viewers didn't find the ad so heartwarming. Users on X and TikTok posted about how the ad made them feel overly surveilled. Others called it \"dystopian.\"\n\nSome of the online backlash also referenced Ring's recent partnership with Flock Safety. A May story from 404 Media alleged ties between Flock and ICE. Local law enforcement may access Ring videos, but they must submit requests that users can deny or ignore.\n\n\"Ring has no partnership with ICE, does not give ICE videos, feeds, or back-end access, and does not share video with them,\" the company wrote in an earlier statement to Wirecutter.\n\nSearch Party does require sign-offs from individual users to release footage. When a pet owner posts about their lost dog in the Ring app, local cameras begin searching. If your camera spots something that looks like the missing dog, you can approve (or deny) sharing the video.\n\n\"The AI is trained on tens of thousands of dog videos so it can recognize different breeds, sizes, fur patterns, body features, unique marks, shape, and color,\" Jassy wrote. \"And privacy stays in your control—you decide each time whether to help.\"\n\nJassy called it one of the \"compelling use cases of AI.\" Indeed, Amazon's Ring has gone all in on AI — both in its products and in the workplace.\n\nWhen founder Jamie Siminoff returned to lead the department in 2025, he mandated that staff show how they use AI when applying for promotions, according to a memo viewed by Business Insider.\n\nSiminoff later confirmed the change in an interview. \"We're going to promote based on AI. We're going to promote based on how you're integrating AI into your job,\" Siminoff told Business Insider.\n\nHe also said that the RBKS department — Ring, Blink, Key, and Sidewalk — asked about AI in hiring interviews. The department is looking to hire AI natives, he said.\n\nSearch Party is just one initiative in Siminoff's push to refocus Ring on security. One of his first moves was to replace Ring's socially driven mission (\"Keep people close to what's important\") with one emphasizing safety.\n\nRing's new mission: \"Make neighborhoods safer.\"\n\nAs for those dogs, Jassy shouted out some pups that had made their way home. One military veteran lost his service dog, Lainey. Ring found her later that day.\n\nNyx dug a hole under the fence. Ring found him within 15 minutes.",

    "fullText": "The Catonsville neighbors of The University of Maryland, Baltimore County, say they were blindsided by a $27 million project paid out of a UMBC capital improvement budget that included clear-cutting nearly 3 acres of trees and bulldozing a stream valley and wetlands on the old Spring Grove Hospital Center.\n\n“What a waste of $27 million — the cost of a new school — to destroy extensive forest and stream natural resources and save nothing,” Jim Himel, a retired forester and executive director of the Spring Grove Arboretum organization, told The Baltimore Sun.\n\nIn a written statement, UMBC officials acknowledged to The Baltimore Sun that they could have done better outreach.\n\n“Engaging local members of the community in our future planning process is a major priority for our leadership in the UMBC Office of Government Relations and Community Affairs,” the statement reads. The university says its plans include a multi-component tree-protection plan with a survey of “specimen trees” with trunks wider than 30 inches, a one-to-one replacement of cut trees, as well as additional tree plantings, and a five-year commitment to ensuring the new trees’ survival.\n\nIn addition to upsetting residents, the project violated state laws protecting wetlands, including Herbert Run and the area fed by an active spring above the creek, according to Maryland Department of the Environment inspection documents obtained by The Sun.\n\nInspections cited the project for multiple instances of silt fences crushed flat by construction equipment, unstabilized slopes, temporary roads crossing tributaries, construction supplies and equipment parked within the streambed and other lapses leading to increased erosion.\n\n“How can you miss a wetland that’s 2- to 4-acres in size,” Himel said. “Because they didn’t identify wetland boundaries, they ended up running their trucks over tree roots and right above a spring head. In a couple of places, it was so mushy they had to put down matting to keep their trucks from getting stuck.”\n\nCatonsville residents, including current and former officials, said the university failed to reach out to the community before bringing in bulldozers and chainsaws.\n\nThe project demolished an area designated by the community as the Spring Grove Arboretum, where neighbors and volunteer organizations helped plant 1,000 trees in 2021 with state funding. In addition to the acres clear-cut along Herbert Run, most of the trees the residents planted around a county ballfield on Wade Avenue were bulldozed for space to park heavy construction equipment and to store piles of building materials. Less than a dozen of the saplings planted by volunteers remain.\n\nUMBC bought the Spring Grove Campus from the State of Maryland for $1 in 2022. The agreement includes a 10-year contract for the state to continue operating the hospital on the site, which can be renewed for two 5-year periods or until Maryland develops replacement facilities elsewhere. In addition to serving voluntary patients and conducting ground-breaking research into schizophrenia, Spring Grove houses court-ordered criminal patients.\n\nUMBC officials told The Sun in an emailed statement school budgeted $27 million in state funding to “restore, stabilize and remediate portions of the site.” Plans the school filed in November 2024 describe work to be performed along more than 4,500 feet of Herbert Run and two unnamed tributaries, as well as repairs to Elm Street.\n\n“As part of this project, we are restoring the West Branch of Herbert Run to reinvigorate many of the site’s natural features and address the negative effects of stream bank erosion, which has contributed to unvegetated, near-vertical stream banks, loss of trees adjacent to the stream, exposure of utilities, and degradation and/or failure of concrete structures within the stream, including bridges,” university officials told The Sun. “We are installing multiple stormwater drainage improvements to stabilize, preserve, and protect the stream, land, and existing buildings from flooding and erosion caused by excessive stormwater runoff. Our work will ensure that the bridges and roadways are safe.”\n\nHerbert Run’s water quality is impaired by “bacteria, ions, metals, nutrients, pesticides, sediment, stream modifications, and toxicity (selenium),” project documents state.\n\nThe foresters who spoke to The Sun disputed the school’s characterization of Herbert Run.\n\nClear-cutting trees and flattening the valley is more likely to degrade the Herbert Run streambed than stabilize it, Himel said.\n\n“It was stable, full of huge trees with trunks over 30 inches in diameter, their root masses armoring the stream banks,” he said. “Why would you cut all those huge trees and open up that whole valley to erosion? They might as well have put a four-lane highway through it, because they changed the entire environment of that stream valley. I don’t think it’s going to hold up when the next heavy rain comes.”\n\nHimel said the stream already runs across bedrock, limiting erosion, and had survived the Beltway development without significant erosion or flooding before this project started.\n\n“I’m rather blown away,” Himel said. “If they’re doing a streambed restoration project here, it seems really unnecessary. Even in 1,000-year floods that wreaked havoc in Ellicott City, the Herbert Run streambed did not leave its channel.”\n\nThe contractor also put logs and other debris in wetland areas fed by that spring, licensed forester and Catonsville resident William Rees told The Sun.\n\n“You can’t put fill in a wetland,” he said. “They put fill and logs in the wetland.”\n\nThe project flies in the face of regional efforts to save the Chesapeake Bay, Rees said, and no restoration plan can reproduce the natural forested streambed that once existed there.\n\n“This wetland around Herbert Run is ultimately the reason we spend billions of dollars on protecting the Chesapeake Bay,” he said. “This riparian forest that grows adjacent to streams is the most highly valued ecosystem in the state.”\n\nDegradation and erosion in streams like Herbert Run ultimately dump silt into the Bay, harming wildlife and shading out the seagrasses that fish, crabs and other species need to survive. Conservationists have identified silt and nutrients like phosphorus and nitrogen as the biggest threats to the Bay’s health, outstripping the impacts of street drugs and other chemicals seeping into waterways.\n\nThe Maryland Department of the Environment visited the construction site at Spring Grove in December and January, issuing more than 30 violations, according to inspection documents reviewed by The Sun.\n\n“We have conducted three recent inspections of the site,” department spokesman Jay Apperson told The Sun. “These inspections found the site to be out of compliance with environmental regulations, and they included directions for corrective actions. We continue to monitor the activities there to see that the site comes into compliance.”\n\nMany of those violations remained uncorrected as of a Jan. 15 inspection, but work continues in Herbert Run, as The Sun recorded by flying a drone over the snowy site.\n\nThe wholesale demolition of the Spring Grove Arboretum hit home to community volunteers who helped plant 1,000 tree seedlings around a new county ballfield in August of 2021. The long-term arboretum effort included public-service volunteer efforts by local Boy Scouts, soldiers from Fort Meade, UMBC fraternities and sororities and public officials, including Dels. Sheila Ruth and Eric Ebersole, and retired judge Susan Souder, an active leader with the Catonsville Tree Canopy Project.\n\nWithin days of their 2021 planting, a county contractor mowed many of them down, according to news reports, despite multiple signs saying “Tree Preservation Area, Keep Out.”\n\nThis winter’s bullcozing and tree cutting by UMBC came as a total shock and a disappointment, Souder told The Sun.\n\n“I’ve been devastated personally, seeing some of our hard work being undone,” she said. “There’s been no outreach of which I’m aware. I’ve heard nothing about what their plans are. … We just had really high hopes for a long time that the state would realize how important this property is in the heart of Catonsville. It provides so much value to our community. A lot of people live in Catonsville because we enjoy being outdoors.”\n\nSouder said she hopes the university will work harder to incorporate the input and efforts of local tree enthusiasts like her, for the benefit of the community and the campus.\n\n“I think everybody in Maryland can be proud of UMBC,” she said. “I don’t understand why they wouldn’t be open to a nonprofit volunteer organization like ours providing an arboretum. To me, it seems so obvious how it would benefit UMBC, their students and visitors.”\n\nHave a news tip? Contact Karl Hille at 443-900-7891 or khille@baltsun.com.",

    "description": "A since-deleted Reddit post claimed OpenAI commissioned a second Super Bowl ad that it decided not to air. OpenAI said the video is fake.",
    "fullText": "On first glance, a recent Reddit post looks like the sort of PR nightmare that would give any tech company cold sweats: a disgruntled employee leaks a shelved Super Bowl ad revealing some highly anticipated products and a big-name celeb.\n\nBut it's all a hoax, according to OpenAI.\n\nGreg Brockman, the AI company's cofounder and president, moved to quickly denounce a now-deleted viral Reddit post that claimed to have footage of a shelved Super Bowl ad featuring actor Alexander Skarsgård with fancy earbuds and a reflective metallic orb device called \"Dime.\"\n\n\"fake news,\" Brockman wrote on X on Sunday night.\n\nAn OpenAI spokesperson confirmed in a statement to Business Insider that the ad was not real.\n\n\"Totally false! Not OpenAI, not connected to us at all. Fake news,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nAlexander Skarsgård stars in a mysterious #SuperBowl commercial for a product called 'dime' pic.twitter.com/xlgtsjPqIB\n\nThe Reddit post claimed that OpenAI opted to air its real Super Bowl ad featuring Codex instead of the device ad.\n\nOpenAI is working on AI devices, but it hasn't revealed much when it comes to details. But it did recruit a huge name to lead its efforts.\n\nLast year, CEO Sam Altman and former Apple design chief Jony Ive jointly announced that they had been collaborating for years. OpenAI also purchased Ive's AI hardware startup for roughly $6.5 billion.\n\nIn November, Ive said a device will be available in less than two years. Altman said during the same joint appearance that he wants the device's simplicity to cause people to say, \"That's it.\"\n\n\"Like it is so simple, but then it just does, as we were talking about, AI can do just so much for you that so much can fall away,\" Altman said during a panel with Ive moderated by Laurene Powell Jobs. \"And the degree to which Jony has chipped away at every little thing that this doesn't need to do or doesn't need to be in there is remarkable.\"\n\nMany users were duped by the supposedly \"leaked\" ad, including Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian, who seemed to suggest the social media platform had once again gotten the scoop on major news.\n\n\"Oh, Reddit. You've done it again,\" Ohanian wrote on X. \"The ad is beautiful btw, they should've run this one.\"\n\n\"This is totally fake,\" OpenAI's Lindsay McCallum Rémy, who works in its communications department, responded.\n\nAI was front and center during what is historically the most-watched live televised event in the US, and thus the biggest day for advertising. In the days leading up to the big game, Altman criticized rival Anthropic for airing what he said was a \"deceptive\" ad that subtly poked fun at OpenAI's plans to add ads to lower tiers of ChatGPT.\n\nOpenAI did air a Super Bowl ad. In its second-ever spot during the big game, the company touted Codex, its coding-focused agent, which has a new model and an accompanying Mac OS app.\n\nThe ad begins with a child's finger tracing a cobweb and intersperses images of a classroom, robot hands, someone loading a Linux disc into an old computer, and even the famous photo of Albert Einstein sticking his tongue, before culminating in the message: \"You can just build things.\"",

    "title": "Anthropic took aim at OpenAI with a snarky ad and won the AI Super Bowl",
    "description": "Early social listening data suggests Super Bowl viewers were more buzzed about Anthropic's ad than OpenAI's.",
    "fullText": "OpenAI CEO Sam Altman made a stink about how Anthropic's Super Bowl ad that took aim at his company was \"dishonest\" — but viewers seemed to love it.\n\nSeparate data from two social media listening companies, Meltwater and Sprout Social, suggest Super Bowl viewers were more buzzed about Anthropic's spot than OpenAI's.\n\nAnthropic's 30-second spot roasted OpenAI over its decision to bring ads to ChatGPT. The ad didn't mention its competitor by name, but featured a scrawny man asking a buffed trainer, \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" The trainer initially gives helpful information in the voice of an AI chatbot, but then quickly segues into an ad.\n\nAnthropic's Super Bowl spot signed off with the tagline: \"There is a time and place for ads. Your conversations with AI should not be one of them.\" (A previous version of the ad that the company teased pre-game appeared to be a more direct swipe at OpenAI: \"Ads are coming to AI. But not to Claude.\")\n\nAfter Anthropic released a series of Super Bowl ad teasers last week, Altman responded with a lengthy post on X.\n\n\"First, the good part of the Anthropic ads: they are funny, and I laughed,\" Altman wrote. \"But I wonder why Anthropic would go for something so clearly dishonest.\" He added more fuel to the fire in an interview with the tech news show TBPN, reiterating his views on Anthropic's campaign.\n\nOpenAI's Super Bowl ad was a more earnest play, which encouraged viewers to use its coding agent to build their dream projects.\n\nData from Meltwater found that OpenAI's ad drew more engagement across social media between February 8 and 9 (25,649 for OpenAI vs. 9,985 for Anthropic). The measure of engagement includes likes, reposts, replies, and comments. However, Anthropic won the battle for positive sentiment. Per Meltwater, 25.5% of the posts about its Super Bowl ad were positive, compared to 16.3% for OpenAI.\n\nPeople discussing Anthropic's ads were largely talking about how funny the ads were, whereas much of the discussion about OpenAI was critical about its plans to bring ads to ChatGPT, Anna Amarotti, Meltwater's global consumer and market insights lead, told Business Insider.\n\nMeltwater's data found that Altman was referenced in about 5.0% of the Anthropic ad mentions and 4.7% of the OpenAI mentions. Anthropic Dario Amodei was present in 0.4% of Anthropic's mentions, and none of OpenAI's ad mentions over the period Meltwater looked at.\n\nThe OpenAI ad itself faced scrutiny, with Meltwater data showing the top viral post pointed out an apparent production error: a Windows laptop displaying the macOS ChatGPT app.\n\nThe new @OpenAI ad from the Super Bowl shows a macOS app running on a Windows laptop pic.twitter.com/vELUHxCwwf\n\nOverall, both brands saw stronger visibility in the lead-up to the Super Bowl than during the live moment, suggesting their impact was driven more by pre-event discussions, Meltwater's Amarotti said.\n\nData from Sprout Social, a social media analytics company that uses a different methodology, showed that Anthropic's ad had driven 7,847 mentions on social media as of early Monday morning, compared with OpenAI's 7,040. Sprout's analysis covered January 27 to February 9.\n\nThe YouTube video of Anthropic's \"Can I get a six pack quickly?\" has drawn more than 402,000 views since it was posted on February 4. ChatGPT's \"You Can Just Build Things\" ad, which was posted to YouTube less than 24 hours ago, has notched up over 81,000 views.\n\nTV measurement platform iSpot found that almost a quarter (23%) of Super Bowl ads mentioned AI, or, in one case — the Swedish vodka brand Svedka — was created using AI.\n\nGoogle had a sentimental commercial about a mother and child designing a new home using its Gemini app. Meta enlisted a Rolodex of athletes and the influencer iShowSpeed to showcase its Oakley Meta Performance AI glasses. The Amazon Alexa spot, starring Chris Hemsworth and Elsa Pataky, poked fun at dystopian fears about AI turning evil.\n\nElsewhere, AI.com — a new AI platform launched by the founder of Crypto.com — invited viewers to visit its website to create a handle and create their own agents. The rush of traffic initially caused the website to crash. EDO, a TV measurement company, said AI.com's ad was the most engaging ad of the entire Super Bowl, driving 9.1 times the median engagement this year. EDO scores ads based on whether they drove consumers to take an action online, such as searching for that brand on Google.\n\nAdvertisers on average paid $8 million for 30 seconds of airtime during this year's Super Bowl, with some 30-second slots reaching as much as $10 million. Many Super Bowl LX advertisers leaned heavily on comedy and A-list celebrities as brands sought to play it safe in a charged political environment.",

    "description": "Surging prices in a corner of the tech market are inflating AI capex. Without that, there could be a \"notable deceleration\" in spending growth: RBC.",
    "fullText": "Big Tech's latest capex projections have shocked investors. Look beneath the headline numbers, though, and spending may actually be growing far more slowly.\n\nThat's according to new research on Monday from analysts at RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAmazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to spend almost $600 billion this year on data centers, chips, networking, and other related gear to meet surging AI demand.\n\nOn the surface, this may look like a relentless acceleration, but RBC's analysis suggests these growth numbers are being flattered by an unusual culprit: runaway memory prices.\n\nThe RBC analysts found that soaring prices for data center memory chips — including DRAM, high-bandwidth memory (HBM), and NAND flash — could account for about 45% of the dollar growth in cloud capital expenditures for 2026. Crucially, most of that increase isn't coming from companies buying dramatically more hardware, but from paying much more for the same components, the analysts said.\n\nRBC estimates that data center memory spending across the top 10 hyperscalers will jump from about $107 billion in 2025 to roughly $237 billion in 2026. That $130 billion increase would represent about 45% of total capex growth at those companies. Even more striking, around three-quarters of the memory spend increase — roughly $98 billion — is attributable purely to higher prices, not higher unit volumes.\n\nThe price shock is severe. TrendForce projections cited by RBC show DRAM prices more than doubling in 2026, while NAND prices are expected to rise more than 85%. Memory has become one of the most constrained inputs in AI infrastructure, as advanced GPUs require large amounts of high-performance DRAM and HBM, while AI data centers consume massive quantities of flash storage.\n\nWhen RBC strips memory out of the equation, Big Tech's spending surge looks meaningfully different. Excluding memory costs, capex growth is projected to drop to about 40% in 2026, down from roughly 80% growth in 2025. That's still a strong expansion, but far less explosive than the raw capex totals imply.\n\nThe analysts described this as \"a notable deceleration,\" while adding that \"it's not necessarily cause for alarm.\"\n\nRBC argued that underlying AI investment remains robust, but warned that memory pricing is now the biggest wild card for capex trends heading into 2027.\n\nIn effect, Big Tech may be spending vastly more on some equipment — without building proportionally more — as the AI arms race collides with an overheated memory market.\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.",

    "description": "Bitcoin is stuck in a rut even as other risk assets rise on Monday. The token is struggling around $70,000 after a brief rally from last week's lows.",
    "fullText": "Bitcoin bounced off its lows last week, but it's struggling around the $70,000 mark on Monday.\n\nThe token's decline brought it to nearly $60,000 last Thursday, before it snapped back on Friday. However, as other assets like stocks and precious metals continue to mount a solid recovery to start the week, bitcoin is in low gear.\n\nThe crypto had lost 1% around midday, trading at about $70,100.\n\nAs bearish sentiment pressures crypto markets, finance pros have been puzzling over why bitcoin can't shake off the doldrums.\n\nEconomist Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic advisor at Allianz, said in an interview on CNBC on Monday that he thinks the current bitcoin meltdown is likely to persist until something changes with the investor base.\n\n\"I think the fundamental theme for bitcoin is continued slow institutional adoption, and it's going to be volatile until that base of resident investors, not tourist investors, becomes big enough to absorb it,\" he said.\n\n\"Tourist investors\" seems to refer to opportunistic traders with a short-term view of bitcoin, who buy quickly and sell at the first sign of volatility. In El-Erain's view, this has compromised bitcoin's stability as speculative traders have rushed in and out.\n\n\"People really bought into adoption that attracted a ton of speculators, and then you got a shakeout,\" he said, referring to the theme of institutional adoption that helped buoy crypto last year, the largest example of which has been broad participation from spot bitcoin ETFs that hold the token.\n\nCrypto bull Anthony Pompliano told CNBC that a few factors are driving bitcoin's current slump, laying out three reasons he thinks bitcoin is in a rut.\n\nFirst, the tendency for investors to take profits when bitcoin soars above key thresholds is a headwind, he said, citing selling pressure as the crypto decisively broke above $100,000 last year. \n\nSecond, increased financialization of bitcoin is a likely catalyst. Pompliano nodded to the boom in complex trades that allow investors to short, hedge, and generally increase their speculation on bitcoin's price, challenging bitcoin's status as a buy-and-hold investment.\n\nThird, Pompliano argued that the market is pricing in lower inflation, diminishing bitcoin's appeal as \"digital gold\" and a hedge against rising prices. Also, gold is still supported by central banks, while bitcoin is not.\n\n\"When you look at who's buying gold, it's the central banks,\" he said. \"And the central banks are essentially trying to get away from all fiat currency, not just dollars. And so I think that bitcoin is just saying to us, 'hey, look, inflation is not going to be a problem in the next two years.'\"",

    "fullText": "This morning, I woke up to a stunning report that Google is gearing up to sell a 100-year bond.\n\nThat follows a similar move in early November, when Google issued a 50-year bond.\n\nInvestors are giving this company billions and are willing to wait up to a century to get it back. In contrast, the US government usually borrows money for a maximum of 30 years.\n\nAnd the interest rates Google is paying are not that much more than what the US Treasury pays. For the 50-year bond, Google paid about 1 percentage point more, but got an extra 20 years to repay.\n\nTo me, this means Google is now considered about as safe a bet as an entity that oversees the world's largest economy, operates the most powerful military on earth, and can print US dollars to pay back what it owes. How is this possible?\n\nIn September, something happened that changed what Google really is. After previously ruling Google was a monopoly, a federal judge delivered remedies that left the company mostly unscathed. In the words of former DOJ antitrust attorney John Newman, \"a judge just decided to let Google keep breaking the law.\"\n\nGoogle essentially became a government-approved monopoly. Other companies in similar situations, such as utilities, have their prices controlled by regulators. In contrast, Google gets to charge whatever it can get away with for online search ads.\n\nThe result is a profit gusher the likes of which the world has never seen. Net income topped $132 billion in 2025, Google reported last week. For 2026, the company plans to spend as much as $185 billion on data centers, chips, and other components to support its AI efforts.\n\nWhen you make and spend this much money, and have this much power — and regulators let it happen — then comparisons with a nation like the US become possible.\n\nWill Google be around in 2075 or 2126 to pay this money back? Right now, it has about as much chance as America to still be thriving in 50 or 100 years.\n\nThis particular 100-year bond is being issued in British pounds, according to the Financial Times. The only other entities to have borrowed for this long in this market are the University of Oxford, the Wellcome Trust, and EDF, the FT noted.\n\nMaking my point: EDF is a utility owned by the French government.\n\nA Google spokesperson said my argument was \"deeply flawed.\"\n\n\"Not even the DOJ argued that Google should be regulated like a utility or that a private company should be turned into a regulated entity with capped pricing,\" the spokesperson added.\n\nGoogle is appealing the judge's monopoly ruling, which \"ignores an intensely competitive market where consumers have more ways than ever to find information online,\" the spokesperson wrote in a statement to Business Insider. \"We're also asking that the implementation of specific remedies be paused as the appeal progresses.\"\n\n Reach out to me via email at abarr@businessinsider.com.\n\nNote: Business Insider sued Google last year, alleging it monopolizes the digital ad market. Google called the suit \"meritless.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell refused to answer questions at a deposition before the U.S. House's Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on Monday, according to lawmakers, ​drawing criticism from both Republican and Democratic members of the committee.\n\nMaxwell, who was found guilty in 2021 ‌for her role in helping Epstein sexually abuse teenage girls and is currently serving a 20-year prison sentence, invoked her Fifth Amendment ‌privilege against self-incrimination and declined to answer questions, lawmakers said after the deposition.\n\n\"This is obviously very disappointing. We had many questions to ask about the crimes she and Epstein committed, as well as questions about potential co-conspirators,\" the committee's chairman, Republican Representative James Comer, told reporters.\n\nDemocrats on the committee accused Maxwell of using the deposition to campaign for clemency ⁠from U.S. President Donald Trump and ‌called on the Republican president to rule out such a move.\n\n\"What we did not get were any substantive answers to the questions that were asked that would advance our ‍investigation,\" said Representative James Walkinshaw, a Virginia Democrat.\n\n\"What we did get was another episode in her long-running campaign for clemency from President Trump. And President Trump could end that today - he could rule out clemency for Ghislaine Maxwell, the monster.\"\n\nDavid Markus, a ​lawyer for Maxwell, said he advised her to invoke the Fifth Amendment as she has a pending ‌habeas petition \"that demonstrates that her conviction rests on a fundamentally unfair trial.\"\n\n\"If this Committee and the American public truly want to hear the unfiltered truth about what happened, there is a straightforward path. Ms. Maxwell is prepared to speak fully and honestly if granted clemency by President Trump,\" Markus said in a statement to the Committee posted on X on Monday.\n\nThe deposition came as the U.S. Department of Justice has released millions of internal documents ⁠related to Epstein.\n\nDocuments released include photos of Trump with several women ​whose faces are redacted and a suggestive note to Epstein, framed ​by the outline of a naked woman, which appears to bear Trump's signature.\n\nTrump has denied any knowledge of Epstein's crimes and says he broke off ties in the early 2000s, ‍before Epstein pleaded guilty in ⁠2008 to a Florida state prostitution charge. He says the suggestive note was faked.\n\nComer said that five more depositions were scheduled in the Epstein investigation, including on February 26 with former U.S. Secretary of ⁠State Hillary Clinton and on February 27 with former U.S. President Bill Clinton.\n\nMarkus said in the post on X that Trump and ‌Bill Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing, adding that Maxwell can explain why.",

    "description": "James Gagliano told CNN's Pamela Brown that he's not convinced the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie is attributable to a traditional kidnapping.",
    "fullText": "Former FBI supervisory special agent James Gagliano told CNN’s Pamela Brown that he’s not convinced the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie is attributable to a traditional kidnapping during a Monday morning interview.\n\nGuthrie, the 84-year-old mother of Today Show host Savannah Guthrie, was reported missing on February 1, and authorities have cited evidence found at the elder Guthrie’s home as reason why they’re treating the case as a likely kidnapping case.\n\nDuring their conversation on Monday, Gagliano explained to Brown why he’s not sure about the theory:\n\nBROWN: The first plea from the Guthrie family, it stressed the urgency of releasing her, their 84-year-old mother. As we know, has serious health issues, desperately needs her medications. We’re now in day nine of her presumably not having those meds. There was no mention of that in this new video. What did you make of that?\n\nGAGLIANO: Yeah, well, you mentioned it. So we have an octogenarian, a woman who’s 84 years old. She obviously has heart conditions, needs medications. And Pam, I’ll give you a stat here. Do you know the percentage of kidnappings that occur of 80-year-olds? It’s like infinitesimal. It’s less than one half of 1%. That’s why this case, again, is so baffling and confounding.\n\nBROWN: And are you convinced it’s a kidnapping?\n\nGAGLIANO: Am I convinced that this was an actual kidnapping?\n\nBROWN: Like an abduction, like they took her-\n\nGAGLIANO: No, and I’ll give you this-, yeah, and I’ll tell you this: there are numbers of ways to conduct kidnappings, right? There’s a new craze of this, and again, we saw this south of the border when I was stationed there called virtual kidnappings where they do everything they can to make you believe that they have your loved one in their quote, unquote “possession” when they don’t. And they’re acting quickly, they’re utilizing AI now, artificial intelligence, to help, you know, cause this fog of vagaries so that the families are panicked and do what they need to do. It’s just, there’s so many questions here and the fact that the kidnappers, if this was a kidnapping, had a 14-hour head start from the time she was dropped off at home, supposedly at 10 o’clock, until the family notified law enforcement sometime around noon the next day, and you see the flurry of law enforcement efforts back and forth. I don’t think there’s anything to be taken from that. People are reading too much into that. That’s the normal progression in an investigation where one lead might trick off another lead, and you move from one thing to the other. And lastly, two things are gonna solve this case: one is good detective work that’s flat footwork, knocking on doors, talking to people, canvassing, interviewing people. And the second piece of this, and the biggest one, is the digital imagery, the digital exhaust that investigators are going through right now from the kidnappers’, quote unquote, “kidnappers'” ransom note. From the door ring bell that was removed, but they might still be able to harvest some forensic evidence there. Things like that are probably gonna solve this case, and we all hope and pray it’s gonna have a good conclusion.\n\nThe post Ex-FBI Special Agent Tells CNN Why He Thinks Nancy Guthrie Disappearance May Not Be ‘Kidnapping’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "She's more than 23 feet long, and verified by Guinness World Records.",
    "fullText": "Nothing could have prepared Radu Frentiu for meeting the snake known as Ibu Baron, which means \"The Baroness\" in Indonesian.\n\n“I had never seen a snake this big,” says Frentiu. “This snake could easily swallow at least a calf, if not an adult cow.”\n\nFrentiu, an explorer and natural history photographer who has lived in Bali, Indonesia, for two decades, has encountered his share of big snakes. But Ibu Baron deserved a record-breaking distinction.\n\nGuinness World Records recently confirmed that Ibu Baron, a reticulated python (Malayopython reticulatus), is believed to be the longest verifiably measured wild snake in the world. She was first discovered in the Maros region of South Sulawesi, Indonesia, in late 2025.\n\nFrentiu learned about the giant python from Diaz Nugraha, a wildlife guide, rescuer, and licensed snake handler from Borneo. Together, they traveled to Sulawesi to see the animal firsthand and measure her.\n\nOn January 18, Frentiu and Nugraha weighed and measured Ibu Baron, documenting the process with photographs and video to be as transparent as possible. Using a surveyor’s tape that followed the snake’s natural curves, they recorded a total length of 23 feet and 8 inches from head to tail tip. The python also weighed in at 213 pounds—and that was on an empty stomach.\n\nFrentiu says the snake’s true length could be even longer, since she was not sedated when the measurements were taken. Under anesthesia, a snake’s muscles fully relax, potentially adding another 10 to 15 percent to her length.\n\nReticulated pythons are already the world’s longest snake species, typically reaching lengths between 10 to 19 feet. Larger individuals have been reported throughout history, but most claims rely on secondhand accounts or animals that were killed shortly after discovery. In many cases, the snakes vanish before their size can ever be verified. “These giant animals attract attention as status symbols,” Frentiu says. “They tend to disappear, or something bad happens to them.” Ibu Baron’s continued survival is what makes her exceptional.\n\nLocal conservationist Budi Purwanto, who acted quickly when word of the snake spread, has played an important role in Ibu Baron’s longevity. Rather than allowing her to be sold or killed, he acquired her and constructed a makeshift shelter on his property, where she now lives alongside several other rescued snakes. Releasing her into the local area would be risky. Large prey animals, such as babirusa and other wild pigs, are scarce, while human settlements are numerous.\n\n“A python this big will probably be drawn toward a village,” Frentiu explains. “And once that happens, it will almost certainly be killed.”\n\nAcross Indonesia, habitat loss and declining prey have pushed large snakes into closer contact with humans. Reticulated pythons are non-venomous, but their size and strength make them lethal predators capable of killing livestock and, in rare cases, people. Human fear is often fatal for the snakes, which are also hunted for bushmeat and targeted by the illegal wildlife trade.\n\nFor Frentiu, Nugraha, and Purwanto, Ibu Baron represents a chance to change that dynamic. By protecting her and keeping her visible, including through recognition by Guinness World Records, they hope to show that giant snakes can be worth more alive than dead. “It can give this animal importance and hopefully value,” Frentiu says. “It can empower local communities to look after these animals and view them as a resource for the long-term.” He points to a growing niche of herpetological tourism—wildlife tours focused on spotting reptiles and amphibians—as one possible path forward.\n\nFrentiu is careful not to frame Ibu Baron as the record-holder for all time—there could be even bigger snakes out there. “I do not believe in the slightest that this is the largest wild snake. I got lucky,” he says.\n\n“There are still wonders out there. This is one of them—and I don’t think it’s the last.”",

    "description": "If you can't be with the one you love, love the movie you're with.",
    "fullText": "Real-life romance is complicated and sometimes exhausting. That can be true for characters in movies, too, but their problems are generally funnier than our own and, anyway, they’re not our problems. A good rom-com is comforting either because we know everything will work out fine, or because we know we won’t have to deal with the hilarious and/or poignant consequences of interacting with other humans.\n\nSadly, the golden ago of the rom-com has passed us by—and Netflix in particular has pulled back on its selection of older (meaning anything much older than a decade) movies in favor of more recent releases, which means you might have to dust off your DVDs if you're looking for a '90s classic to get you in the Valentine's Day mood. On the other hand, that also means there are probably a lot of newer rom-coms on the service that you haven't seen before, including a handful of original films you won't find anywhere else.\n\nAdapted from Emily Henry's popular 2021 novel, People We Meet on Vacation goes the When Harry Met Sally route, following a couple of college besties who nurse confused, complicated feelings about one another over a period of years—recounted in not-entirely-linear flashbacks. Emily Bader is Poppy, a travel writer who's bored and unfulfilled with her job (her job...taking exotic vacations? OK.), while Tom Blyth is her pal Alex, with whom she spends one week a year on vacation. As the movie opens, the two haven't spoken in a couple of years, but are both headed to a Barcelona wedding that will be make-or-break for their relationship.\n\nJennifer Kaytin Robinson (Do Revenge, I Know What You Did Last Summer) makes her directorial debut with this charming rom-com that's less about the boys than it is about the power of friendship to help us deal with relationship nonsense. Gina Rodriguez is Jenny, a music journalist who lands her dream job only to have her long-term boyfriend (LaKeith Stanfield) immediately dump her. Her bestie Erin (DeWanda Wise) is struggling to admit her feelings to her girlfriend, while Blair (Brittany Snow) knows that she needs to ditch her man, but can't bring herself to do it. The solution to all their problems? One last wild night out before Jenny leaves town for her new gig.\n\nNora Ephron's followup to Sleepless in Seattle doesn't have quite the classic cachet of that earlier film, but Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan are every bit as delightful as they were in the earlier movie. Inspired by 1940's The Shop Around the Corner, the story finds Hanks' Joe Fox and Ryan's Kathleen Kelly maintaining a sweet, anonymous, and increasingly intimate online relationship without realizing that they know each other IRL, and don't much care for each other (probably because he's trying to put her charming neighborhood bookstore out of business). It's very cute, and also a fun trip back to a time when email and chatrooms were novelties.\n\nAn underrated triumph from the late Rob Reiner, this one is both a sweet romantic comedy and a genuinely smart movie about American politics. Michael Douglas plays Andrew Shepherd, the widowed president in the middle of a re-election campaign who develops feelings for tough environmental lobbyist Sydney Ellen Wade (Annette Bening). Their romance simmers in the background while real world issues play out, as the script mines genuine comedy out of the complications of a U.S. president trying to conduct a giddy, but clandestine, relationship with a \"normal\" woman while also running the country. Martin Sheen and Michael J. Fox co-star; Aaron Sorkin wrote the script, something of a dry run for TV's The West Wing a few years later.\n\nThe title of this South Korean import isn't some kind of euphemism. In fact, it's a pretty direct description of the film (think Secretary, but sweeter). Jung Ji-woo (Seohyun) is great at her job at a public relations firm, but doesn't always get the respect she deserves from her male colleagues. Because of their similar names, she accidentally opens a package for new co-worker Jung Ji-hoo (Lee Jun-young) that contains a leather collar and a leash. Horrified, he claims it was intended for his dog, but she ain't buying it. Instead, she's intrigued, and as the two gradually build toward a contractual BDSM relationship, and her dominant role helps her find confidence in the workplace, and what starts off as something like a business relationship develops into something a bit more romantic.\n\nGina Rodriguez plays sportswriter Mack, who has spent years writing hook-up plays for her friends—elaborate schemes that have led her and the crew to any number of one-night stands. The tables are turned when she falls for a war correspondent (Tom Ellis) who only sees her as a hookup. Her best friend Adam (Damon Wayans Jr.) jumps in to help her land her man, and unexpected complications arise when he realizes that his own feelings for Mack aren't entirely platonic.\n\nThis \"Netflix Original\" from director Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused, Boyhood) was actually acquired by the streamer after it made a splash at the Sundance Film Festival, no doubt in anticipation of leading man Glen Powell finally having his moment. And certainly he's got charisma to spare in this shaggy-dog rom-com/thriller in which he plays Gary Johnson, a college professor who moonlights as a participant in sting operations for the New Orleans police department, pretending to be a hit man to rope in would-be criminals. When he feels a spark with his latest mark, a woman (Adria Arjona) desperate to escape an abusive husband, things get complicated. It's a great premise, the leads have chemistry to spare, and it's altogether a great hang.\n\nSpeaking of Glen Powell, he co-headlines this 2023 throwback (an extremely loose adaptation of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing) with Euphoria's Sydney Sweeney that became a box office hit despite a savaging by critics. The pair play an investment banker and a college student, respectively, who meet cute but suffer a classic rom-com misunderstanding that leaves them both bitter—then, two years later, they meet up at the destination wedding of her sister and his roommate's sister, perfectly positioned for a classic enemies-to-lovers turnabout.\n\nJessica Williams plays the title's New York City playwright, who finds herself at loose ends following a bad breakup and a seemingly endless string of rejections for her work. She's introduced to divorced Boone (Chris O'Dowd), with whom she bonds over life's disappointments. The real charm in this smart indie are in its performances, as well as its conviction that romance needn't be an end unto itself, but can go hand in hand with a renewed sense of artistic purpose.\n\nBumped from theaters and sold to Netflix at the beginning of the pandemic, his two-hander starring Issa Rae and Kumail Nanjiani was largely overlooked at the time, but deserves a second chance. They play a couple whose relationship is at a low point after four years together. Through bizarre circumstances, the same night they decide to break up, they are the joint witnesses to a murder and must go on the run—and nothing reignites an old flame like life-or-death stakes. The film was directed by Michael Showalter, who helped put Nanjiani on the map with 2017's The Big Sick.\n\nThe first Spike Lee joint, this enormously charming low-budget feature follows Nola Darling (Tracy Camilla Johns), a young artist living in Brooklyn in the pre-hipster 1980s, as she muses on her romantic relationships with three different men (one of them played by Lee himself). If a little rough around the edges, it's an extremely accomplished debut, hinting at Lee's future career with creative flourishes, from a documentary shooting style to sequences in which interviews with the characters (and a handful of real people) offer commentary on the difficulties of navigating romantic relationships in the then-modern era.\n\nVietnam is the real star in this, the first movie to be shot in the country following the COVID-19 pandemic. Rachael Leigh Cook (She's All That) stars as a travel executive (dealing with a recent break-up, naturally) who sneaks off to Southeast Asia to go undercover on one of the group tours her company promotes. In the process she meets tour guide Sinh (Scott Ly), who encourages her to step outside of her comfort zone. Together, they explore some of the most beautiful features of modern Vietnam. Probably they fall in love too, IDK.\n\nViolet Jones (Sanaa Lathan) spends her life in near-terror of rain, for fear that her rigorously straightened hair will be ruined. That hair is a signifier in every aspect of her life, straightening sessions even having been a way to bond with her demanding mother (Lynn Whitfield). Following a breakup with her boyfriend because of her exacting nature (particularly regarding her hair), she experiments with: different colors that her friends object to; a natural style that renders her either invisible or the subject of derision; she even shaves her head at one point, which only gets her invited to a cancer support group. Director Haifaa al-Mansour’s movie makes a great point about the fraught nature of Black hair, particularly when that hair belongs to a woman. Meeting a salon owner in the middle of a freakout, Violet begins a slow journey to learning to love herself, her hair, and maybe even the hot salon owner (Lyriq Bent).\n\nRomantic comedies are often (not always) comfort food, and so we often find familiar plots: Here, longtime friends who’d lost touch (Ali Wong and Randall Park) reconnect after a falling out years before. She’s a successful celebrity chef and engaged; he’s fixing air conditioners with his dad, which is how the two meet up. Nahnatchka Khan (creator of Fresh Off the Boat) brings a light touch here, and Wong and Park have great chemistry; they’re joined by a fun supporting cast that includes a really funny turn from Keanu Reeves playing himself.\n\nSome of the best romantic comedies involve a slightly outlandish scheme, and this reliably charming Netflix original has one of those great setups: Two overworked assistants (Zoey Deutch and Glen Powell) come up with the idea that, if they can get their bosses (Lucy Liu and Taye Diggs) laid, they’ll be less interested in stressing out their employees. So the two harried assistants plan to set their bosses up, which, not unexpectedly, goes very comedically awry in pretty much every way. Naturally these things never work out as planned, and the romance in the offing is not the one that anyone had expected.\n\nThough Numa Perrier’s film hits plenty of the traditional rom-com beats, lead Gabrielle Union provides the spark that ignites the whole film (based on the Tia Williams novel). She’s never been better than she is here, playing Jenna, a woman in her 40s making a clean break of a long-term relationship and taking on a high-profile, high-stakes career in beauty journalism—only to wind up in a one-night stand with Eric (Keith Powers), 15 years younger and the son of her boss.\n\nWriter/director Alice Wu made a splash with her queer classic Saving Face way back in 2004. Her long-awaited follow-up, a comedy-drama inspired by Cyrano de Bergerac, is better. Here, friendless high schooler Ellie Chu (Leah Lewis, from “Nancy Drew”) is tasked with writing love letters to her crush, Aster (Alexxis Lemire), on behalf of a football player named Paul. There’s plenty that’s familiar here, but Wu makes everything feel fresh and fun.\n\nOne of the most iconic and memorable rom-coms of the 1990s might be new to many American viewers, who are missing out on a movie that’s both wonderfully goofy and deeply poignant in the best tradition of the genre. Shah Rukh Khan plays Rahul Khanna, best friends in college with Anjali (Kajol), but smitten with Tina (Rani Mukerji). Rahul and Tina get married and time goes by, but Tina always feels a little bit guilty, like maybe she got in the way of something. With little time left to live following complications in childbirth (did I mention there’s also drama here?), Tina writes her daughter a series of letters—the last one asking that she make sure that dad and Anjali reconnect.\n\nIndian director Ritesh Batra (The Sense of an Ending and The Lunchbox) brought together screen legends Robert Redford and Jane Fonda for this well-received romantic drama from a top-rate director. Despite the ominous title, it’s a quiet and sweet film that’s worthy of its stars. It’s not really a comedy, so I’m cheating a bit by putting it here, but it’s got such a satisfyingly light touch that it hits most of the same buttons as more straightforward rom-coms.\n\nHigh schooler Alex Truelove (Daniel Doheny) is psyching himself up to have sex with his girlfriend, Claire, for the first time—but something’s holding him back. Openly gay Elliott (Antonio Marziale) has an idea why Alex is so reluctant and, frankly, the audience ought to have a clue by that point, as well. It’s a perfectly sweet, good-natured coming-of-age story that has some fun with Alex’s awkward efforts to set expectations aside and just kinda be himself.\n\nIf you want a rom-com to clean up at the Oscars, you're gonna need to put it in drag. Maybe throw in some Shakespeare. Hell, might as well make it about Shakespeare. A lot less heavy than 2026 Oscar contender Hamnet, this one finds Joseph Fiennes as the rakish title character to Gwyneth Paltrow's Viola de Lesseps, the daughter of a wealthy merchant who loves the theater so much that she's more than willing to dress up like a man to get to appear on stage. Their eventual infatuation will have to overcome the strictures of the era and earn the approval of Judi Dench's Queen Elizabeth.\n\nAsha (Pallavi Sharda) just broke off her engagement and left her Wall Street investment firm in favor of a Jersey City startup. Her concerned mother sets her daughter up on a dating app, and Asha acquiesces to a single date with the first match: Ravi (Suraj Sharma). It doesn’t go particularly well, but they’re both under a lot of parental pressure to get married, and Asha has about a dozen weddings to go to over the course of the summer, most of them filled with busybodies who want to see her in a relationship. So, naturally (for a movie), Ahsa and Ravi decide to play at being a couple to get people off their backs—which works out fine, until it doesn’t.\n\nClass-busting romance is nothing particularly new, but this candid Saudi Arabian comedy-drama sees middle-class civil servant Barakah (Hisham Fageeh) strike up a relationship with Bibi, a boundary-pushing Insta celebrity. Just finding time and space to pursue a frowned-upon relationship in modern Saudi is challenging, but the movie explores the social and political obstacles with a light touch.\n\nImagine that everyone you’d ever had a crush on received a letter expressing your exact feelings. It’s a nightmare scenario, but a reality for shy high school junior Lara Jean (Lana Condor), who’d written the letters as a form of secret diary, only to show up at school one day to find that her little sister had mailed them all. Can you imagine? Condor is fantastic here, and the whole thing is delightful. It’s been followed by two also-very-good sequels, as well as an ongoing spin-off series (XO, Kitty).\n\nWe start out in familiar territory here: Dineo and Noni (Fulu Mugovhani and Tumi Morake, both very funny) are a couple of successful big-city women—this time in Johannesburg. Dineo is on the hunt for a long-term relationship, even after getting dumped via livestream at work, while Noni is perfectly content with one-night stands. Their romantic (and un-romantic) trials are alternately charming, horrifying, and hilarious. The heart of the movie is its two leads, and the friendship that sustains them.",

    "title": "This Study's List of the Most Invasive AI Browser Extensions Includes a Few You Probably Use",
    "description": "AI-powered add-ons may collect a lot of information about you.",
    "fullText": "Browser extensions, even ones from trustworthy sources, are not without privacy and security risks. I've written before about add-ons that manage to slip through official store safeguards and even some that \"wake up\" as malware after operating normally for several years, so it should come as no surprise that a host of AI-powered browser extensions—collectively installed by tens of millions of users—may also be invading your privacy.\n\nResearchers at data removal service Incogni looked at browser extensions available in the Chrome Web Store that included \"AI\" in their name or description and employed AI as part of their core functionality. By analyzing the data collected and permissions required, they assessed both how likely extensions are to be used maliciously and their potential to cause significant damage if compromised.\n\nIncogni found that website content, such as text, images, sounds, videos, and hyperlinks, was the most commonly collected data type (by nearly a third of AI-powered extensions). More than 29% of extensions investigated harvest personally identifiable information (PII)—name, address, email, age, identification number, for example—from users. Other forms of data collected include user activity, authentication information, personal communication, location, financial and payment information, web history, and health information.\n\nThe most invasive extensions fall in the programming and mathematical aid category (such as Classology AI and StudyX), followed closely by meeting assistants and audio transcribers. Writing and personal assistants also pose privacy risks—and many of these are also among the most downloaded AI-powered extensions in Chrome.\n\nIncogni also assigned \"privacy-invasiveness\" scores to the most downloaded AI-powered extensions, a combination of the amount of data collected and both general and sensitive permissions required:\n\nGrammarly: AI Writing Assistant and Grammar Checker App (tied for #1)\n\nQuillbot: AI Writing and Grammar Checker Tool (tied for #1)\n\nSider: Chat wiht all AI (tied for #3)\n\nAI Grammar Checker & Paraphraser — LanguageTool (tied for #3)\n\nWPS PDF — Read, Edit, Fill, Convert, and AI Chat PDF with Ease (tied for #4)\n\nMonica: All-in-One AI Assist (tied for #4)\n\nAI Chat for Google (tied for #4)\n\nImmersive Translate — Translate Web & PDF\n\nGrammarly and Quillbot were found to collect PII and website content as well as location data like region, IP address, and GPS coordinates. Grammarly also harvest user activity through network monitoring, clicks, mouse and scroll positions, and keystroke logging. While both also require sensitive permissions—such as the ability to inject code into websites and access active browser tabs—they have a relatively low risk of being used maliciously.\n\nBrowser extensions that use AI aren't inherently bad, but you should be aware of what information they are collecting and what permissions they are requiring. The most common type of sensitive permissions required are scripting, which allows the extension to interact with pages as you navigate online, as well as activeTab, which lets it read or modify the page for the current session.\n\nWhen adding an extension (or installing an app or program), carefully review the permissions requested. If they aren't essential to the extension's functionality–or if they are but don't seem justified—you may be putting your data or device at risk by allowing them. As Incogni points out, users have to decide how much privacy to sacrifice in order to use apps and services.",

    "title": "The Out-of-Touch Adults' Guide to Kid Culture: Is Jeffrey Epstein on Fortnite?",
    "description": "It's an especially strange time in popular culture.",
    "fullText": "Things seemed very quiet this week in the world of youth culture, so I asked my always-connected son what kids were talking about. \"Dad, the Epstein files,\" he said. \"That's all anyone is talking about.\"\n\nI like to keep things light here, but it's not possible at the moment; The Epstein files are the culture right now, no matter what age you are. Younger people are trying to figure out how to fit this massive thing into their idea of the world, just like you probably are. Smaller kids are contextualizing the files by visiting/making Roblox Epstein Islands and joking about it in school (then asking their folks what it really means). For young 'uns, it seems like \"Epstein's Island\" is becoming shorthand for a forbidden haunted place, like \"Diddy Party\" was 14 years ago—wait, I mean five months ago.\n\nOlder young people are making Epstein Phonk videos on TikToks, making memes out Epstein's sweater and putting themselves in pictures from the files with AI. They're also poring over the millions of documents, like everyone, and they think they found something that older people might have overlooked.\n\nAmong the many conspiracy theories circulating about the Epstein files is that Jeffrey Epstein was playing Fortnite last week. Even for conspiracy theories, this is a stretch, as it requires that Epstein be alive, but here's the evidence: A YouTube receipt addressed to “littlestjeff1\" is included in the files, and there was a player using that handle playing Fortnite last week. That's all. Despite a sane reaction being, \"OK, so what?\" the rumor apparently caused enough commotion that Fortnite's parent company addressed it, saying it was a player who changed their handle after the name was posted online in connection with Epstein:\n\nLike any internet theory, you can dig into it deeper, but you'll find only unverifiable screenshot \"evidence\" that anyone could have made at any time, elaborate theories connecting unrelated data points to land on baseless conclusions, a lot of passionate people defending the theory, and a company doing desperate damage control. It's a morass, and a really bleak look at the foreseeable future of American culture.\n\nThe Fortnite thing looks like bullshit, but Epstein actually was a gamer. Well, he had an XBox Live account, anyway. Among the documents in the files is an email from Microsoft, sent on December 19, 2013, permanently suspending the account associated with Epstein's email address. It's a boilerplate ban message, citing \"harassment, threats, and/or abuse of other players\" that has been \"determined to be severe, repeated, and/or excessive.\"\n\nA follow-up email reveals that Epstein was banned from Live because Epstein was a registered sex offender. \"This action is based on the New York Attorney General's partnership with Microsoft and other online gaming companies to remove New York-registered sex offenders from online gaming services to minimize the risk to others, particularly children,\" the email reads.\n\nLet's talk about the word \"phonk,\" since it came up earlier in the column and it's about art instead of depravity. \"Phonk\" has a complicated history. It was coined in the 2010s by rapper SpaceGhostPurrp to describe his take on 1990s Southern hip hop that featured slow, \"chopped and screwed\" production and the use of vintage Memphis rap vocals. Interestingly, the elements of phonk spread mainly through SoundCloud and other online outlets, so it's a subgenre of music that grew without a geographic \"base.\"\n\n(Bonus explainer: SpaceGhostPurrp is an underground rapper widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in the 2010s \"internet rap\" era.)\n\nBut when kids talk about \"phonk\" nowadays, they usually mean something else. In the late 2010s, a genre emerged from Russia that was dubbed \"drift phonk.\" Drift phonk began as the soundtrack of videos of cars drifting. It's fast, often features heavy distortion—and, unlike SpaceGhost's \"phonk,\" which is good, drift phonk is bad. To me. Judge for yourself. Anyway, \"drift phonk\" gradually just became \"phonk\" and spread from car videos to become the most common soundtrack to brainrot videos.\n\nMore slang! \"Boy aquarium\" is a TikTok slang term that describes hockey games. The word is closely linked to the popularity of HBO's hockey-player romance series Heated Rivalry, and posting videos about the boy aquarium is becoming popular on TikTok. Some are very funny:\n\nIf your feed is filling up with weird cartoon version of the people you're in parasocial relationships with, here's the deal: The new trend is asking ChatGPT or another AI to come up with a caricature of you based on only the interactions you've had with it. It's popular, because it's easy to do, and kind of funny—or so I thought before I tried it.\n\nJesus—I want to punch myself in the face.\n\nThis week's viral video is a duck with a clover on its head.\n\nThere are many, many cute ducklings who never did anything bad to anyone on TikTok's baby ducks hashtag. Look at this little guy just cheepin' away! This duckling is trying on hats because he thinks he's people! Here's some lil' babies taking a bird bath. This one fell asleep in a mug!",

    "description": "Sorry—you weren't actually invited to a party.",
    "fullText": "If you receive an event invitation via email, verify it's legit before you RSVP, as you may not actually be invited to anything. Malwarebytes Labs has identified a new scam in which threat actors are using party invites to trick users into installing a remote access tool (RAT) that gives them full control over infected devices. (This specific campaign seems to be limited to the UK, but similar tactics could easily spread.)\n\nThe scam starts with an innocuous-looking email invitation with an informal \"Save the Date\" vibe that may appear to come from a friend or acquaintance. The message contains a link to \"View Invitation\" for event details. If you click through, you'll end up on a landing page with a bold \"You're Invited\" header and a button to download your invitation, but you don't actually need to take any further action—your browser automatically triggers the download of a .msi file, which is not actually a party invitation or RSVP form but an installer.\n\nThe MSI silently installs ScreenConnect Client, a legitimate IT support tool that allows remote access into the user's machine. Once this connection is established, attackers have the ability to see your screen, control your mouse and keyboard, and upload or download files—even if you restart your computer. All of this happens in the background with no obvious indicators that a remote access tool has been installed and is now running, so victims are unlikely to have cause for concern.\n\nAs Malwarebytes points out, this scheme is successful because it relies on normal human behavior around a seemingly low-risk situation: opening an event invitation. What's unusual is that there's little pressure or urgency in the initial message. Instead, the landing page has language like \"a friend has sent you an invitation\" and \"I opened mine and it was so easy,\" which is a form of social proof that guides users to take the desired action.\n\nYou should always be alert to unsolicited invites sent via regular email with a link to an external site as well as any communication that prompts you to download or install software. These days, invitations are commonly delivered through apps and digital services like Partiful, Paperless Post, Evite, or Apple Invites, which are generally more trustworthy than random emails with hyperlinked text. If you're unsure whether the invite is real, verify with the sender through another channel before clicking or downloading anything.\n\nAs mentioned, victims of this scam may not immediately notice that a RAT has been installed on their device. But there are some red flags, such as unexplained cursor movement or windows opening or closing on their own. You can check your machine for a file named \"RSVPPartyInvitationCard.msi\" or a service called ScreenConnect Client with additional random characters in the title.\n\nIf you've already downloaded ScreenConnect from a malicious invite, Malwarebytes recommends disconnecting from the internet and uninstalling the program immediately. Run a security scan to check your device for malware, and change important passwords from a separate device.",

    "description": "Bro-speak makes dangerous behaviors sound like virtues.",
    "fullText": "When I asked real people why they post their workouts online, I received well over a hundred replies, many of them filled with venting about body image issues and unattainable beauty standards. That's didn't surprise me. What did surprise me was that the majority of these responses came from men.\n\nCarefully measured chicken and rice, obsessive tracking of macros, the guilt when a workout is missed: On social media, these behaviors are framed in the language of performance and strength. The same rituals that would be clear indications of disordered behavior for women are redefined as “discipline” and “optimization” for men. How many men suffer in silence because eating disorders are coded as a women's issue? How many cases go unrecognized when they're framed as \"clean eating\" or \"serious training\"? When eating disorders and body dysmorphia get rebranded as \"fitness goals,\" a lot of men are left struggling in plain sight.\n\nBoys and men now make up about a third of those diagnosed with eating disorders, and that figure likely understates the crisis. In particular, muscle dysmorphia—sometimes called \"bigorexia\"—is characterized by excessive and compulsive exercise, a persistent belief that one is insufficiently muscular, and an obsession with muscle mass, size, and leanness.\n\nUnfortunately, much of fitness culture allows men to engage in disordered behaviors by wrapping them in performance language. \"Bulking\" and \"shredding\" cycles can mask seriously problematic eating patterns. Without giving certain men in my life an armchair diagnosis, I can confidently say I’ve seen the mental fallout when someone’s extreme caloric restriction becomes \"cutting\" or compulsive exercise becomes \"staying on track.\"\n\nUnsurprisingly, social media amplifies these harmful messages. Mason Boudrye, who describes himself as \"someone known to post gratuitous thirst traps,\" shared with me the mental fallout of always trying to look a certain way. “Even if people don't admit that the obsessive tracking and strict adherence to diet qualifies as disordered eating, I know it’s true for me,” he says. The social media of it all makes these feelings even more public and persistent.\n\nWe all scroll through feeds of chemically enhanced physiques presented as natural and achievable. This naturally breeds more self-scrutiny, more comparison, more perceived inadequacy. Matthew Singer, a yoga teacher, says most “fitspo” (fitness inspiration) “is as helpful for fitness as previous winning lottery numbers are for winning millions. Fitspo cannot take into account genetics, job and family circumstances, health history, or any of the other countless factors that influence health outcomes.\" Our bodies are treated like projects always in need of correction, devoid of much-needed context.\n\nWhat’s most troubling to me is the way men don’t get to call out disordered behaviors by name. There is both a misconception around who eating disorders affect, and a deep reluctance among affected men to seek help for a problem they've been socialized to handle alone. Society has constructed a masculine ideal that equates vulnerability with weakness, making it nearly impossible for some men to admit they're struggling with their relationship to food and their bodies.\n\nBotox injections in men may get called “Brotox,\" but a cheeky nickname shouldn't shroud the fact that unattainable beauty standards are leading men to take more extreme measures. Dr. Claudia Kim of New Look New Life Cosmetic Surgery says she's seen a rise in men turning to beauty treatments: jawline contouring, under-eye correction, hair restoration, skin rejuvenation. “These approaches offer noticeable yet discreet results with little downtime,” says Kim, fitting neatly into lives that were never supposed to include these concerns.\n\nWhat's telling, Kim adds, is that her male patients are usually entering the aesthetic realm for the first time. In this sense, men are catching up to beauty regimens women have been undertaking for generations, and slowly learning what women have long understood: Namely, that appearance affects professional success, social capital, and romantic prospects—and the goalposts are always moving. At the same time, the masculine ideal demands stoic self-sufficiency, even as it requires costly and constant aesthetic labor.\n\nWhat does all this mean for the average person with an average budget? The treatments Kim describes—jawline contouring, hair restoration, aesthetic procedures—aren't cheap. Nor are supplements, meal prep services, personal trainers, specialized equipment, and so on. Beauty standards increasingly require you to spend more money, meaning your appearance is yet another health arena where class determines outcomes. And if they can’t afford to look the way they feel pressured to look, men are uniquely left behind to suffer in silence.\n\nAs a woman, I’ve spent most of my life jealous of how men were allowed to age, or gain weight, or simply be in their bodies without constant intervention. Now I have a more sympathetic gaze, especially after hearing so many men admit they were never given the language to articulate aesthetic concerns without shame.\n\nThere’s a big difference between healthy self-care and the sense that your body is never good enough. Meticulously tracking every calorie, every rep, every perceived flaw—why should one woman’s obvious eating disorder be another man’s enviable achievement?\n\nWomen have been battling body image issues and unattainable beauty standards since birth, but a lot of men were never taught how to fight this particular war. To me, the takeaway is that we all need to be on the same side. To fight this war, we need a more honest conversation about what we're doing to men's relationships with their bodies. Until we acknowledge that, all this talk of \"cutting\" and \"discipline\" will allow dangerous behaviors to keep hiding in plain sight.",

    "title": "When to Exercise With Light Weights (and When to Use Heavy Weights)",
    "description": "It's a myth that it doesn't matter which you choose—but both have their benefits.",
    "fullText": "In the world of exercise, variety abounds. You can lift light weights, or heavy weights, or no weights at all. If you don’t lift at all right now, it doesn’t matter much where you start. But that doesn’t mean that all of these options are equivalent. Light weights can build muscle, but they do not have the same benefit as heavier weights.\n\nIt takes different workouts to get the most benefit out of light weights versus heavy weights. And heavy weights can do some things that light weights can't. I'm going to unpack all of that below, but right now the most important thing I want you to understand is that it's not correct when people say light weights are \"as good as\" heavy weights or that it \"doesn't matter\" which you use.\n\nFriends, it does matter. You might decide that lighter weights are best for you, or you might want the benefits that heavy weights provide. But you deserve to know the difference. Because there is definitely a difference. Even the studies that show benefits of lighter weights for muscle gain still find that heavy weights have advantages.\n\nFor example, this meta-analysis gathering the results of 178 different studies found that \"Higher-load (>80% of single repetition maximum) prescriptions maximised strength gains, and all prescriptions comparably promoted muscle hypertrophy [growth].\" In short: light weights can help you gain muscle (with caveats, which we’ll discuss) but they aren’t a good way to build your strength, in the sense of your real-world ability to lift heavy things.\n\nYou can do a lot with light weights, and I’m not knocking them. They’re especially great for beginners, since they’re easy to handle and not too intimidating. If you’ve never lifted a weight before, it makes sense to grab the 5-pound or 10-pound dumbbells rather than heading straight for the squat rack. I even have a list of exercises that work best with light weights, like wrist curls and weighted deadbugs.\n\nIf you’d like to continue with light weights past the beginner stage, that can work too—depending on your goals. It is true that you don’t need to lift heavy weights to build muscle. Light weights, which I’ll define here as anything you need to lift for 12+ reps before you start to feel any burn or fatigue, can signal your body to build more muscle tissue as long as you keep lifting until you literally cannot lift them any more. That’s called lifting “to failure.”\n\nThe problem is, lifting light weights to the point of failure is boring as hell. It’s also easy to stop short of failure, because you’re tired and bored and you want to quit. If you’re capable of lifting 20 reps with a certain weight, but you stop around 12, you’re going to miss out on most of those muscle-building benefits.\n\nWe also know that most people underestimate themselves, doing fewer reps or choosing a too-light weight for their intended exercise. If you aren’t constantly asking yourself “can I do more?”, you might be missing out on the muscle growth (or “toning”) that you’re hoping to get.\n\nA muscle’s size and its strength are two different but overlapping concepts. A bigger muscle does tend to be a stronger one, and vice versa. But if you want to be able to lift something heavy in real life—like a 50 pound bag of cement at Home Depot—a person who trains with 50-pound weights is going to have an easier time of it than a person who never has never picked up a dumbbell bigger than 10 pounds.\n\nRemember how light weights need to be lifted to failure to stimulate muscle growth? That’s because our bodies can choose to only “recruit” a few muscle fibers at a time to do a job. If you pick up a 2-pound dumbbell, your nervous system says “ehh, we only need a few motor units to do this job” and doesn’t bother activating the rest. But as you reach your 18th, 19th, 20th rep, it has to recruit more and more of those fibers as the ones you used at first begin to tire out. With heavy weights, though, you end up recruiting large numbers of muscle fibers right from the start.\n\nHeavier weights tell your body to grow the muscle and they teach your muscle fibers and your brain how to work together. The first time you try a new exercise, it will seem hard. After a few weeks, or maybe even a few days, you’ll be able to move a lot more weight more smoothly—even if you haven’t grown any extra muscle tissue by that time.\n\nYou need to work with heavy weights if you want to learn to move heavy weights. Many people also prefer heavy weights because each set of an exercise is over in just a few reps—maybe eight or 10, or in some cases as little as a single rep. What counts as \"heavy\" depends on the person—I've written about how to know what counts as a heavy weight for you.\n\nYou also don’t need to go all the way to failure when you’re training with heavy weights, which is something that lifters often appreciate. If I have 200 pounds on the barbell for squats, I might technically be able to squeeze out seven reps. But my workout for the day might only call for four or five. I find that a lot more enjoyable than doing 20+ goblet squats with a dumbbell. The dumbbell is lighter, but using a heavy barbell means I get to stop before I’m exhausted.\n\nAs with many things in life, the “why not both?” approach is best for most people. Strength athletes (including powerlifters, Olympic weightlifters, and Crossfitters, to name a few) will typically center their routines around a few heavy lifts, and then get in some extra work with lighter or medium-ish “accessory” lifts. That’s still a solid approach for the average person who just wants to lift for fun or for health.\n\nIt’s also important to remember the “light” weights need to get heavier over time, as you get stronger. Even Jane Fonda, remembered for eight-count exercises with small dumbbells, told viewers in the introduction to her famous vifdeo that they’ll want to switch out for heavier weights as they gain experience. This is, in a nutshell, the concept of progressive overload.\n\nMeanwhile, “heavy” just means any weight that doesn’t take dozens of reps to get results. If you can only do about 10 pushups, then pushups count as a “heavy” exercise for you. Going for something heavy on a compound exercise (one that involves multiple body parts) gives your body a loud signal to increase your strength, while leaving you plenty of time for lighter exercises if those are how you prefer to spend your gym time.",

    "title": "Five Ways to Make Your Phone Charge Faster",
    "description": "You might be waiting longer for a full charge than you need to be.",
    "fullText": "Getting a little bit of extra juice into your phone before you leave your house in the morning could make the difference between the device still having power at the end of the day or not. But there are multiple factors that affect charging rate, and you might not be aware of all of them.\n\nRun through the tips here, however, and you can be sure your phone is always charging up as quickly as possible.\n\nTo begin with, you're going to get your phone charged a lot faster if you plug it directly into a power source rather than putting it on a wireless charger. Wireless charging offers a lot of convenience, and is gradually getting faster and faster as far as charging rates go, but wired charging is still a long way ahead.\n\nTake the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra, for example: You get a maximum charging rate of 45W with a wired connection, and 15W with a wireless connection over Qi2. That means the handset is going to take around three times longer to charge its battery via wireless charging. The figures for other handsets are similar.\n\nNot only is wireless charging slower, it's typically less efficient as well, with more of the power being supplied to the phone lost as heat (due to the way the electricity is converted to a magnetic field and back again). With a cable and a plug, charging is faster, and it's healthier for your battery as well.\n\nWired is the way to go if at all possible, and what you plug your phone into makes a difference as well. Wall sockets are very good for charging rates, while anything else is less good—options like laptop USB ports, USB hubs, and sockets you might find on other gadgets such as monitors won't supply as much power.\n\nA lot of phones don't come with a charger and cable in the box these days, but they will have a fast-charging standard and a max charging rate associated with them if you check the specs. You then need to find a charger that matches that charging rate, together with a cable that's not going to slow anything down.\n\nIf you look at the iPhone chargers made by Apple and on sale from its store, there are 20W, 35W, and 60W options—and the latter is going to juice up your handset the fastest. You should also look out for a mention of USB Power Delivery (PD), though this is included on pretty much every charger you'll find at this stage.\n\nWe've written in-depth before about USB-C cables and charging blocks, and these will again list a charging rate along with them (or at least they should). You need to make sure every link in the chain is delivering power at the maximum rate your phone can handle if you want to fully recharge as quickly as possible.\n\nYou can use cables and chargers you have lying around for laptops, tablets, and other gadgets with your phone safely enough—the handset will have built-in safety features to prevent it from drawing too much power—but for the best results you'll generally want to stick with what comes in the box or the officially approved option.\n\nThere are a few other tricks you can try if you want to max out charging speed. Think about the amount of power your smartphone is using while it's actually being charged: If you're constantly scrolling through social media feeds, watching videos, and playing games, then you're using precious battery life while recharging.\n\nIf you can, put your phone down and leave it alone while it's charging—you might want to turn off the always-on display to help things a little bit more. For even better results, put your phone into airplane or low power mode, or turn it off entirely while it's charging (those notifications can wait).\n\nDue to battery chemistry and the safeguards built into modern handsets, charging speeds slow down if your phone gets too hot or too cold. Keep your phone away from sunny window ledges or freezing bathrooms while it's being charged to maximize charging speed.\n\nIt's a good idea to remove any case around your phone while you're charging it, to reduce the chances of the battery temperature rising an extra notch, and it's also worth checking the USB-C charging port on your phone to make sure it's dust- and lint-free—even a slightly imperfect connection can affect charging speeds.\n\nHowever you're charging your phone, both Android and iOS let you keep an eye on how fast the battery is being replenished. If you've got a Pixel or Galaxy phone, keep an eye on the charging message at the bottom of the lock screen: This tells you how quickly your phone is being charged, and how long it will be until you reach a full charge.\n\nFor most Android devices, you can get more information by opening up the Battery page in Settings, though the details you get here will differ among devices: You should see whether or not fast charging is enabled, and maybe an estimate for how long a full recharge will take, but you won't typically get an actual wattage reading.\n\nWith iPhones, you can visit Battery in Settings to get information about how the battery recharge is going. While there's not a whole lot of information here, you can get an estimate of how long a charge will take, and you will see a \"slow charger\" message if your iPhone can support a charging rate faster than that offered by the connected charger.\n\nThere are several Android apps that measure charging rate. Ampere is one of the best: It's free, with extra features (such as widgets and notifications) available for a fee. Note that you need to multiply current x voltage then divide by 1,000 to get the wattage. There isn't really anything comparable on iOS, unfortunately—what few apps there are appear to be out of date and/or unreliable.",

    "title": "Ring's 'Search Party' Feature Is Creepy, but You Can Disable It",
    "description": "You don't have to be a part of Ring's surveillance state.",
    "fullText": "If you tuned into Super Bowl LX on Sunday, you may have caught Ring's big ad of the night: The company tried to tap into us dog owners' collective fear of losing our pets, demonstrating how its new \"Search Party\" feature could reunite missing dogs with its owners. Ring probably thought audiences would love the feature, with existing users happy to know Search Party exists, and new customers looking to buy one of their doorbells to help find lost dogs in the neighborhood.\n\nOf course, that's not what happened at all. Rather than evoke heartwarming feelings, the ad scared the shit out of many of us who caught it. That's due to how the feature itself works: Search Party uses AI to identify pets that run in its field of vision. But it's not just your camera doing this: The feature pools together all of the Ring cameras that have Search Party enabled to look for your lost dog. In effect, it turns all these individual devices into a Ring network, or, perhaps in harsher terms, a surveillance state. It does so in pursuit of a noble goal, sure, but at what cost?\n\nThe reactions I saw online ranged from shock to anger. Some were surprised to learn that Ring cameras could even do this, seeing as you might assume your Ring doorbell is, well, yours. Others were furious, lashing out at anyone who thinks Search Party is a good idea, or that the feature isn't the beginning of a very slippery slope. My favorite take was one comparing Search Party to Batman's cellphone network surveillance system from The Dark Knight, which famously compromised morals and ethics in the name of catching the bad guy.\n\nAccording to Ring, Search Party is a perfectly safe and wholesome way to look for lost dogs in the area. The company's FAQs explain that users can opt-out of the feature at any time, and only Ring doorbells in the area around the home that started the current Search Party will look for the dog. In addition, Ring says the feature works based on saved videos, so Ring doorbells without a subscription and a saved video history won't be able to participate. (Though I'm not sure the fact that the feature works with saved videos assuages any fears on my end.)\n\nI am not pro-missing dogs. But I am pro-privacy. At the risk of sounding alarmist, Search Party really does seem like a slippery slope. Today, the neighborhood is banding together to find Mrs. Smith's missing goldendoodle; tomorrow, they're looking for a \"suspicious person.\" Innocent until proven guilty, unless caught on your neighbor's Ring camera.\n\nHere's the big question regarding Search Party and its slippery slope: Can law enforcement—including local police, FBI, or ICE—request saved videos from Ring cameras participating in Search Party in order to track down people, not pets?\n\nYou won't be surprised to learn that that wasn't answered by Ring's Super Bowl ad, nor is it part of the official Search Party FAQs. However, we do know that, as of October 2025, Ring partnered with both Flock Safety as well as Axon. Axon makes and sells equipment for law enforcement, like tasers and body cameras, while Flock Safety is a security company that offers services like license plate recognition and video surveillance. These partnerships allow law enforcement to post requests for Ring footage directly to the Ring app. Ring users in the vicinity of the request have the choice to either share that footage or ignore the petition. Flock Safety says that users who do choose to share footage remain private.\n\nOf course, law enforcement isn't always going to ask for volunteers. According to Ring's law enforcement guidelines, the company will comply with \"valid and binding search warrants.\" That's not surprising, of course. But the company does note an important distinction in what it will share: Ring will share \"non-content\" data in response to both subpoenas and warrants, including a user's name, home address, email address, billing info, date they made the account, purchase history, and service usage data. The company says it will not share \"content,\" meaning the data you store in your account, like videos and recordings of service calls, for subpoenas, only warrants.\n\nRing also says it will tell you if it shares your data with law enforcement, unless it is barred from doing so, or it's clear your Ring data breaks the law. This applies for both standard data requests, as well as \"emergency\" requests.\n\nBased on its current language, it seems that Ring would give up the footage used in Search Party to law enforcement, assuming they present a valid warrant. The thing is, it's not clear whether Search Party has any actual impact on that data: For example, imagine a dog runs in front of your Ring doorbell, and the footage is saved to your history. Now, a valid warrant comes through requesting your footage. Whether you have Search Party enabled or disabled, Ring may share that footage with law enforcement—the feature itself had no impact on whether your doorbell saved the footage. The difference would be whether law enforcement has access to the identification data within the footage: Can they see that Ring thinks that dog is, in fact, Mrs. Smith's goldendoodle, or do they simply see a video of a fluffy pup running past your house? If so, that would be your slippery slope indeed: If law enforcement could obtain your footage with facial recognition data of the suspect they're looking for, we'd be in particularly dangerous territory.\n\nI've reached out to Ring for comment on this side of Search Party, and I hope to hear back to provide a fuller answer to this question.\n\nIf you'd rather not bother with the feature at all, Ring says it's easy enough to turn off. To start, open the Ring app, tap the hamburger menu, then choose \"Control Center.\" Here, choose \"Search Party,\" then choose the \"blue Pet icon\" next to each of your cameras for \"Search for Lost Pets.\"\n\nTo be honest, if I had a Ring camera, I'd go one step further and delete my saved videos. Law enforcement can't obtain what I don't save. If you want to delete these clips from your Ring account, head to the hamburger menu in the app, tap \"History,\" choose the \"pencil icon,\" then tap \"Delete All\" to wipe your entire history.",

    "title": "Discord Is About to Force You to Prove Your Age",
    "description": "You'll need to scan your face or provide an ID to prove you're an adult.",
    "fullText": "On Monday, Discord announced its plan to begin rolling out mandatory age verification globally. Starting in March, new and existing accounts will start moving over to a \"teen-by-default\" setting, which will lock certain chats and features away until the account's owner proves they're an adult. Here's what you'll lose, how to get it back, and for good measure, what your other options are.\n\nIn its announcement, Discord said the new age verification settings will start with a \"phased global rollout\" in March, so it may be some time until it hits you. However, once the changes make their way to your region, you'll lose access to the following features until you verify your age:\n\nAge-restricted channels and servers: This is the most obvious one. Any channels that are set to adults only will now be off-limits to your account until you verify your age. In some cases, this could include whole servers, or depending on the server, certain app commands.\n\nSpicy content: Until you verify your age, Discord's content filters will be active for you, and the app will blur any images it thinks are too sensitive or graphic.\n\nMessage requests: Direct messages from people you don't know will now go to a separate inbox.\n\nSpeaking in Stages: Accounts that aren't age-verified won't be able to speak in Stage channels, which are livestreams where a few server members can broadcast to everyone on the server at once.\n\nWarnings on friend requests: This one adds something rather than taking it away. Until you verify your age, you'll now see a warning prompt when getting a friend request from someone you don't know.\n\nDiscord has two ways to verify your age, though it will tell you if you need to go through the process. To the platform's credit, it won't suddenly strip away a bunch of features from you without explanation.\n\nTo start verifying your age on Discord, either click Get Started on a prompt the platform should send you once age verification hits your region, or navigate to User Settings > My Account > Age Group to see your age group and verify from there.\n\nNow, you can either take a video selfie or scan a valid government ID. For video selfies, just select Take a selfie from the verification page, follow the on-screen instructions, and click Done to submit. For verifying through a government ID, select Use your ID, scan the provided QR code with your mobile device, take a clear photo of your ID on said device, and tap Done to submit.\n\nDiscord says that video selfies used for age verification are processed purely on-device, and that while photos of government IDs do go to \"vendor partners\" for verification, they are \"deleted quickly—in most cases, immediately after age confirmation.\"\n\nOnce you've submitted your video selfie or ID, the app will then begin the process of assigning you an \"age group,\" which you'll be able to see under User Settings > My Account > Age Group. Discord says most users only need to verify once, but that you might need to provide a government ID in addition to a video selfie if the app can't confidently determine your age from just a face scan. You're also able to attempt re-verification at any time, but if the app determines that you're under the 13-year-old minimum for using Discord, your account will be banned. (You can appeal this and attempt to re-instate your Discord account via an ID.)\n\nAccording to Discord, the age verification process \"typically takes just a few minutes,\" and you'll get a notification and DM once it's completed.\n\nAs countries around the world add new laws for age verification online (Discord mentions the UK and Australia in particular), it seems like Discord is just throwing its hands up and deciding to play it as safe as possible by taking the feature global. The move mimics similar decisions from Google, ChatGPT, and Roblox, but even adult users might be uncomfortable with it, since they'll need to show the company—and the company's third-party processors—personal identifying information to comply with it.\n\nIf that leaves a bad taste in your mouth, there are a few Discord alternatives you can try that don't yet require age verification, although they might not completely match the app's feature set:\n\nSlack: Discord basically stole Slack's entire flow, and that's great news for anyone looking for a Discord alternative. About the only Discord feature missing here is persistent voice channels, although you can still talk to others over voice using huddles. Slack can be a strong Discord replacement or supplement to another Discord replacement, but if you're a teen looking for a new home, be careful. Technically, users under 16 are banned from Slack, according to the app's terms of service.\n\nTeamSpeak: TeamSpeak has been updated since the 2000s to match many of Discord's features, including adding persistent chat channels. However, it's still lagging behind on some features, like video chat. Additionally, only 32 users can be in a free TeamSpeak server at a time. This is what I used as a teen before moving onto other platforms.\n\nMumble and Ventrilo: These are no-frills, voice-first clients that primarily focus on privacy and low latency connections, with Mumble even being open source. They aren't as robust as Discord, but they could serve as a strong voice channel supplement to another Discord alternative, like Slack.",

This is a club which has a big place in English football and a fantastic history,\" he said.\n\n\"All of the focus will be on winning games as quickly as possible and getting the best out of the players.\n\n\"Fans can expect our team to be aggressive, really compact defensively and attack with pace.\"\n\nStill takes over with Watford 11th in the Championship, but only three points outside the play-off places before Saturday's game at Preston North End.\n\nStill has managerial experience in the Belgian Pro League with Charleroi, KAS Eupen and KV Kortrijk.\n\nHe has also previously worked as assistant to his younger brother Will at French club Lens, guiding them to an eight-place finish in Ligue 1 in 2024-25.\n\n\"Ed's appointment was made on the conviction that this is a coach whose modern and progressive coaching methods fit perfectly with our squad dynamic, who we believe will take the team forward, and who gives us a real chance to challenge for the play-offs,\" said Watford chairman and chief executive Scott Duxbury.\n\nFormer Bournemouth defender Charlie Daniels, who has been interim boss at Vicarage Road for the past two matches, will take on the role of first-team coach alongside Karim Belhocine.\n\n\"We are delighted Charlie Daniels has accepted Ed's invitation to be part of his coaching staff, as we are really grateful for the job and work he did in the interim period,\" said Duxbury.\n\n\"He quickly earned the respect of the technical department and the players, and his promotion maintains that link with the academy.\"\n\nStill becomes Watford's third head coach this season with Paulo Pezzolano lasting only 10 games at the start of the campaign prior to Gracia's reappointment, having previously left in 2019.\n\nThe Hornets also had three bosses in the same season in 2021-2022 when Xisco Munoz, Claudio Ranieri and Roy Hodgson took charge, and again in the following campaign when Rob Edwards, Slaven Bilic and Chris Wilder held the job.\n\nStill is Watford's 14th head coach, not counting interim bosses, since September 2019 when Gracia left for the first time, and their 11th since the end of the 2020-21 season.\n\nAnalysis - Geoff Doyle, BBC Three Counties Radio sports editor\n\nI think this could be described as a pretty left-field appointment given Watford are only three points from the play-off positions and Ed Still has no British, let alone Championship, management experience.\n\nHe has worked in Belgium for the majority of his coaching career and with his brother Will in France at Lens.\n\nChief executive Scott Duxbury speaks of the young squad Watford have and the hope they will identify with Still, so the Hornets hierarchy are banking on him forming a good relationship with this youthful set at Vicarage Road to get them back on track.\n\nWatford have good contacts in Belgium so Still has obviously impressed them. His first task will be to get the Watford supporters on board who seem underwhelmed by the appointment.\n\nLatest Watford news, analysis and fan views\n\nListen to Watford content on BBC Sounds",

    "fullText": "Tottenham captain Cristian Romero is a \"leader\" but must learn to control his aggression after his second sending-off of the season, manager Thomas Frank says.\n\nRomero was shown his latest red card for a tackle on midfielder Casemiro in Saturday's 2-0 loss at Manchester United, meaning he will be suspended for four games.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference as Spurs prepare to take on Newcastle United on Tuesday, Frank said he was confident the 27-year-old Argentina centre-back had the right blend of skills to succeed.\n\n\"For me, I think he is a leader. He is a young leader. He's learning every day.\n\n\"I've said I used the example when I was 30 years old. I thought I was on top of the world, but I was no way near the level I am today in terms of leadership and understanding things.\n\n\"And then when you have a player that's playing with so much passion and aggression, things like that can happen.\n\n\"That's not to say he shouldn't learn from it, of course he needs learn from it, going forward.\"\n\nFrank had already defended Romero after Saturday's match, saying he would not consider taking the captain's armband away from him.\n\nHe will not feature again domestically until 15 March when Spurs take on Liverpool.\n\nHow 'irresponsible' captain Romero's week ended in 'perfect storm'\n\n'Disgraceful Spurs had 11 fit players' - captain Romero\n\nAlso missing for the next four to five weeks will be defender Destiny Udogie, with Frank confirming the Italian, 23, has suffered hamstring damage.\n\nHis absence adds to Tottenham's injury woes, with only 11 fit senior players available for their game against Manchester City at the start of this month.\n\nAsked whether Dejan Kulusevski, who has been out with a knee injury since May, is likely to play this season, Frank said: \"I don't know.\n\n\"[He] has got another appointment at the end of this week where we will know more, but of course if he's out of the Champions League squad it's a sign it is not tomorrow [that he will return].\"\n\nFollowing a seven-game winless run in the Premier League, Spurs are 15th in the table, six points above the drop zone.\n\nAsked if he viewed the club as being in a relegation fight, Frank told reporters there was \"no doubt we are desperate to win games, desperate\".\n\n\"Of course, we haven't won enough,\" he said. \"If you are not desperate you do not understand the situation you are in.\"\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "With Wales reeling from another thrashing by England, BBC Sport pundits analyse the areas they must improve against France.",
    "fullText": "There are countless problems facing Welsh rugby right now.\n\nSo to pick out five areas for the men's national team to improve before they face Six Nations champions France next weekend is like trying to choose which root vegetable you would use in a sword fight with a samurai.\n\nIt is coming up to three years since Wales won a Six Nations match, with Saturday's 48-7 drubbing by England the latest in a long, ever-increasing line of humiliations.\n\nThere are facets of Wales' game that urgently need addressing before freewheeling France bring their Grand Slam-chasing bandwagon to Cardiff.\n\nHere, BBC Sport pundits analyse some of the priorities for head coach Steve Tandy and his players.\n\nThe most obvious place to start is defence.\n\nWales have conceded 248 points - including 34 tries - in Tandy's first five games in charge.\n\nThose are grim statistics in any context but they will be particularly concerning for Tandy, who was previously defence coach for Scotland and the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\"There's so much to try and fix in a week, and you can't fix everything,\" former Scotland captain John Barclay said on Rugby Special.\n\n\"You fix the things that are easiest to fix. First up: tackling. Defence is much easier to do than attack - it's more of a mindset.\n\n\"If you're Wales defence coach, you're looking at the lack of intent in the tackle. That's not a skill decision, that's a mindset decision.\n\n\"How do we get in front of people? How do we slow them down? Let's fix our defence, let's be a hard team to play against, let's not give away easy wins.\n\n\"That's what they did against England - they gave away so much.\"\n\nWales were expected to lose against England - and heavily.\n\nWinning at Allianz Stadium in Twickenham is never easy for a visiting team, never mind one in a state of crisis.\n\nHowever, Wales' lack of discipline on Saturday made their task infinitely more difficult.\n\nWales conceded 16 penalties - their highest total in a Test since 2009 - and had four yellow cards, the joint most any team has been shown in a Six Nations match.\n\nTwo of those sin bins, for prop Nicky Smith and captain Dewi Lake, came in the opening 18 minutes.\n\n\"It's not possible to play international rugby and concede 11 penalties within the first 20-25 minutes and two yellow cards,\" former Wales scrum-half Richie Rees said on the Scrum V podcast.\n\n\"We saw the impact that it had towards the tail end of the game, the fatigue of the players, their body language. They were absolutely out on their feet.\n\n\"I don't blame them. Tomos Williams, Louis Rees-Zammit and Aaron Wainwright - they were completely out on their feet. It comes down to the indiscipline, that is something they can control.\n\n\"There were complete variants in the type of penalties that they gave away, but it's something that they simply have to improve, and at least it is something that is in their domain.\n\n\"There's a couple of other things going into France next week .What are we really going to hang our hat on? It has to be our discipline; it has to be miles better because if that happens again, it's going to be a repeat of what we've just seen.\"\n\nGiven Wales' sorry recent form, only a handful of players can be sure of their places in the team to face France on Sunday.\n\n\"We have to change some players because some of those players have had plenty of chances, and they're simply not good enough on the international level,\" ex-Wales back-rower Emyr Lewis told BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast.\n\n\"I don't like to name individuals but, without a doubt, the balance in midfield isn't right, so I would definitely bring bigger players in like Owen Watkin. We know how good he is defensively and we have to have a strong defence against France.\n\n\"The back row, again no balance there, we have to bring in bigger players especially against such a huge French pack. I'd definitely bring in Ollie Cracknell.\n\n\"We have to look at bringing in big, strong, rough players who will give the French pack a challenge.\"\n\nFormer Wales centre Scott Williams is another who would like to see changes in his old position.\n\n\"As a former centre, Ben Thomas didn't have the best of games if I'm honest,\" Williams said on Scrum V.\n\n\"Eddie James can be a real weapon for us, he's a massive guy, but I looked at the stats and he had three carries.\n\n\"I know that's not all on him, that's the way the game went. But he's a 12 in my eyes. He needs to get on the ball, needs to get Wales over the gain line. He's 108 kilos, or whatever he is, he's hard to stop.\n\n\"I'd like to see Eddie James at 12. He needs to be at 12. Whether Ben Thomas goes 13 or whatever, I just think he's a little bit lost there.\"\n\nRees also wants to see bigger, more physically imposing players selected.\n\n\"For me you need [wing or centre] Mason Grady and [prop] Rhys Carre on the field,\" he said on the same podcast.\n\n\"Otherwise France could run away with the game early on and it becomes difficult when you try and bring them on too late, as we saw against England.\"\n\nWales did not get much of a chance to show their attacking threat against England because they spent most of the match defending.\n\nOn the rare occasions they did have the ball, Wales' lineout malfunctioned and the backs did not click into gear.\n\n\"I couldn't see an identity with Wales and we didn't do the simple things right,\" former Wales and Lions wing Alex Cuthbert told the Rugby Union Weekly podcast.\n\n\"Lineouts were a problem all game. Their skills came under pressure and they made errors. That's what happens when you can't match up physically and, right now, we just don't have those players.\n\n\"Even when we scored it was just one way. It was slow, lethargic and we looked like we were lacking ideas. That's what happens when you lose power.\n\n\"[Wales attack coach] Matt Sherratt will be very detailed in attack about first plays off lineout and scrum but, when you don't win the first couple of collisions and you don't have parity [up front], then there's nothing you can really do.\n\n\"We're 11th in world and I don't see us better than, say, Italy in 10th.\"\n\nThe technical side of the game is enough of a concern but, according to former England wing Chris Ashton, Wales' mauling at Twickenham also exposed some mental flaws.\n\n\"It was the easy stuff that let them down,\" he said on Rugby Special.\n\n\"It's the easier part of the game to be mentally switched on, to not give penalties away, to not allow England into your 22 and give easy tries away.\n\n\"You'd think that's a side of the game that you can take for granted, that the lads would be switched on, but they weren't.\n\n\"It just goes to show he [Tandy] is trying to put fires out everywhere and sometimes you can lose concentration on what you're trying to do.\n\n\"Steve's meant to be the defence coach, and that's an area that's struggling. Is he trying to spread himself too thinly across everywhere instead of concentrating on one department?\"\n\nEven if Wales significantly improve all these elements of their play, they still face a daunting task when France visit Principality Stadium.\n\nLes Bleus tore Ireland to shreds in their opening 36-14 win on Thursday, scoring five tries in a devastating attacking display.\n\nIf France were able to dismantle Ireland so brutally, it is a frightening prospect to consider what they might do to Wales.\n\n\"I'm very worried about Sunday,\" former Wales wing Philippa Tuttiett told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"I hate to say this being Welsh but, as a rugby fan, I'm actually excited to see this France team and the brand of rugby they are playing.\n\n\"That loss in the autumn to South Africa seems to have ignited them and, even though they won the Six Nations last year, they seem to have taken their game to another level.\n\n\"The way this fresh-faced France beat Ireland was so impressive and Wales should be fearful.\"",

    "description": "Lando Norris' confidence is \"even higher\" for the 2026 Formula 1 season after winning his first drivers' title last year, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown says.",
    "fullText": "Lando Norris' confidence is \"even higher\" for the 2026 Formula 1 season after he won his first drivers' title last year, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown says.\n\nAs McLaren launched their car for the new season, two days before the start of the second pre-season test in Bahrain, Brown said Norris wanted to become a multiple title winner.\n\nHe predicted the British driver's team-mate Oscar Piastri would again pose a strong challenge, having led the championship for much of last season only to fade in the final part of the year.\n\nHe said: \"There are some drivers that say, 'I've done it, now I'm done.'\n\n\"And then you have drivers like Lewis Hamilton and Max Verstappen and Michael Schumacher who go, I've done it once, now I want to do it twice and three and four times.\n\n\"Lando's confidence is very high. He's highly motivated. It's our job to give he and Oscar equipment again to be able to let him fight it out for the championship. But if we can do that, I would think Oscar and Lando will both be in with a shout.\"\n\nBrown said that, as last year, the team would allow their drivers to race each other for the title.\n\n\"They continue to be free to race. Again, we will be strategic and intelligent when situations arise. There won't be much change because they were free to race last year,\" he said.\n\nBrown is optimistic McLaren, who also won their second consecutive constructors' title last year, will be \"strong\" when the new season starts with the Australian Grand Prix from 6-8 March.\n\nBrown said the evidence of the first 'shakedown' test in Spain last month was that they, Mercedes, Ferrari and Red Bull \"all seemed competitive\".\n\nBrown said: \"Very risky to judge. Spain, what I would say is we feel like we'll be competitive.\n\n\"Very early days, but indications that we will be strong. But it would be premature to make any predictions beyond that.\"\n\nCadillac unveil split livery in Super Bowl advert\n\nBrown was dismissive of the row that is taking place in F1 ahead of the season regarding the engine rules.\n\nMercedes' rivals have complained to governing body the FIA that the former champions have found a way to circumvent the rules regarding compression ratio.\n\nThis is set at a maximum of 16:1 and the rules say it is measured at ambient temperature.\n\nAudi, Honda and Ferrari fear Mercedes have found a way to exploit the way materials expand with heat to have the engines running to a higher compression ratio when the car is on track.\n\nThis, some say, could give a power advantage worth about 0.3 seconds a lap. Talks are ongoing on the issue.\n\nMcLaren use Mercedes customer engines and Brown said: \"It's typical politics of Formula 1. The engine has been designed and totally compliant within the rules. That's what the sport is about. I don't believe there's a significant advantage.\n\n\"They'll make some story out of it, but reality is the engine is completely compliant past all its tests.\"\n\nAsked if he was concerned that the row could lead to a situation where Mercedes were forced to modify their engine, which would be problematic in the timescale before the first race of the season next month, Brown said: \"I can't imagine that you wouldn't have Mercedes teams on the grid in Australia.\"\n\nBrown said it was \"too early to tell\" whether the complexity of the energy management required under the new regulations introduced this year would make it harder for teams using customer engine supplies to compete with manufacturer teams.\n\nBrown said: \"We know we get the same stuff. We've proven the last couple of years that a customer team is not at a disadvantage of a works team, so I don't see any reason why that won't continue.\n\n\"But I don't think we yet have a full understanding of how to best use these power units.

    "description": "Scotland coach Gregor Townsend has decisions to make about the back three, at hooker and at lock before Saturday's match against England.",
    "fullText": "Having won their opening game in the Six Nations for five seasons in a row, Scotland's forlorn grind for relevance has started early this time.\n\nAfter death in the Eternal City comes the resurrection mission in Auld Reekie.\n\nIt's a dismal reflection on the state of things that Scotland are now looking for yet another \"reaction\" after yet another defeat.\n\nBut that is where they are under an increasingly beleaguered Gregor Townsend and a coaching regime that has been there too long and needs breaking up with new voices being heard.\n\nThe players, too, must be boring themselves at this point.\n\nTheir coach is under the cosh, but they continue to fail on multiple fronts - attitude, accuracy, mental strength, ruthlessness. They are bobbing along and going nowhere.\n\nAs an international rugby nation, the Scots are now deep into their third decade of existential crisis, so you'd think the awfulness of Saturday's defeat by Italy in Rome would be easier to take.\n\n'Townsend on the ropes after romp in swamp'\n\nFive talking points from Six Nations opening round\n\nThe 'proud of the effort' mantra from Townsend is the biggest red rag to the biggest Scottish bull.\n\nThe scale of the failure was epic, not so much because they lost - because this was always going to be a tight game against a fine Italy team - but in the way they lost.\n\nTheir lack of aggression and intent from the start, their defensive disorganisation for Italy's tries, the terrible weaknesses in their lineout (while Italy were nailing most of theirs), the self-harming bouts of indiscipline at critical times, their inability to problem-solve on the move.\n\nItaly were missing some key players. Scotland were missing no-one.\n\nWhen it came to coaching nous and player execution, Italy had a little too much of both.\n\nThey inflicted a soul-destroying defeat on Scotland, but, in many senses, Scotland did it to themselves. A recurring theme, that.\n\nThe feeling of fury in the aftermath is unprecedented since Andy Robinson's team lost to Tonga in 2013 and Matt Williams' team lost to, well, pretty much everybody in his slapstick years in charge.\n\nA campaign over after just one game? Maybe premature, but you can't fault anybody for thinking it.\n\nEngland will expect an angry Scottish reaction on Saturday. Some of the visitors, hard-bitten by recent experience, will know that there's fire and brimstone coming their way.\n\nThe home fans in vast numbers are now dead against Townsend remaining as coach, but come kick-off time in Edinburgh, you won't know it. The place will be electrified.\n\nCould you discount a Scotland upset? No. Would you bet on it? No, again.\n\nAt Murrayfield, the decision-makers are sitting in silence, apparently still confident that improvement will come if they just hold their nerve.\n\nAs a reminder, Townsend took over in 2017. He's nearly 100 games in. This is his ninth Six Nations. Scotland have never contended.\n\nHis future is being talked about, but not by the people who might determine it. Not yet.\n\nThat might come later, depending on what happens in the weeks ahead - 'might' being the operative word - but for now there is a Calcutta Cup to deal with and a world of questions for Townsend to answer.\n\nTownsend picked on form in Rome, but it was a brutal experience for all involved, particularly Jamie Dobie, one of the best Glasgow Warriors players in a stellar season for his club side.\n\nThe weather made it a dogfight in the air. Scotland won some battles, but Italy won the war.\n\nScotland's victories in the contestable kicking duels led to field position, which they subsequently butchered.\n\nSome of Italy's wins led to points, particularly when Louis Lynagh out-did Dobie just before the Tommaso Menoncello try and the Italy forwards were way more alert in mopping up in the aftermath.\n\nWould it have been any different had Townsend gone with his established three of Blair Kinghorn, Darcy Graham and Duhan van der Merwe? Unlikely.\n\nIt wasn't a day for Kinghorn's game - and he hasn't been playing great in France in any event. Van der Merwe - still fighting to regain form - is vulnerable in the air at the best of times.\n\nThese are huge calls for Townsend. Rip it up or keep faith? Van der Merwe has been a wrecking ball to the English, a bogey man they have largely failed to contain.\n\nHe has scored seven tries in five games in the Calcutta Cup. The fixture stirs something inside him.\n\nWill Townsend pick on vibes? Will he put the band back together? What, then, about the notion of picking on form? The form guys out wide all season have been Kyle Steyn and Dobie.\n\nYou can see Kinghorn reappearing at 15 and Graham taking over from Dobie. Pondering the Duhan Effect will keep the coaches up all night.\n\nTwice in the opening 11 minutes in Rome, Scotland had an attacking lineout in the Italy 22.\n\nOn any day, these were glorious chances to build pressure and add points. On a day like Saturday, they were golden opportunities. They lost both lineouts.\n\nTheir drill both times was hardly complex. The throw went to the front - the safest option - and Italy were up quicker to steal it. It was the kind of sluggishness that proved so costly.\n\nThe rain pelted down, but Italy found a way to deliver a functioning lineout. Scotland toiled miserably.\n\nThey were beaten at the front, in the middle and then, in a monsoon, they launched some over the back. No lifter, no jumper, no communication. It was a mess.\n\nAnd everybody was to blame, not just Ewan Ashman and George Turner.\n\nA change at hooker? If Dave Cherry was to be parachuted in from the second tier of French rugby then it wouldn't be a huge surprise.\n\nCherry can throw, but if the whole operation is as hapless again then everybody may as well stay at home. You don't win Tests with a third-rate lineout.\n\nMore changes at lock? Given how passive Scotland were in the beginning, they'd better get more energy in from the start on Saturday.\n\nGregor Brown to start ahead of Grant Gilchrist and alongside Scott Cummings.\n\nJamie Ritchie's brutality at seven instead of Rory Darge. Get some attrition in there. Some belligerence. Some leaders.\n\nMaybe there's an almighty eruption on the cards on Saturday. An ambush. A smash-and-grab. Maybe a formidable-looking England are about to get run over by wrathful Scots.\n\nThe fact that Scotland are in this place - backs to the wall and looking for salvation - is a grim and unchanging picture of their painful struggle.",

    "fullText": "Scottish Premiership: Heart of Midlothian v Hibernian\n\nVenue: Tynecastle Park, Edinburgh Date: Tuesday, 10 February Kick-off: 20:00 GMT\n\nCoverage: Live commentary on BBC Radio Scotland, BBC Sport website & app\n\nHeart of Midlothian face \"13 cup finals\" between now and the end of the season if they are to claim their first Scottish title for 66 years, according to head coach Derek McInnes - and few will come bigger than Tuesday's visit by city rivals Hibernian.\n\nThe Premiership leaders slipped up last Tuesday, when a brave hour of battling while down to 10 men came to nothing thanks to St Mirren's 88th-minute winner in Paisley.\n\nThe following evening, fifth-placed Hibs were the ones to leave it late, coming from 2-1 down to beat Dundee United in the closing minutes.\n\nNow David Gray's side will be looking to dent Hearts' title challenge again as they aim for a derby double after their 3-2 win at home in December.\n\nIt is all set up for a cracker, with the visiting head coach predicting \"chaos\" in Gorgie.\n\nWho has your Premiership club brought in & let go? - January 2026\n\nPremiership leaders Hearts slip to defeat at St Mirren\n\nHibernian net stoppage-time winner in Dundee United thriller\n\nA city divided, but both team bosses are united on at least one opinion - the maroon half of Edinburgh deserve to be where they are given their performances so far this season.\n\nSlip up on Tuesday, though, and their four-month spell at the top of the table could come to an end 24 hours later should Rangers win their equally tough fixture away to fourth-top Motherwell.\n\nTo avoid that fate, McInnes says his side \"cannot dwell\" on their defeat in Paisley and the loss of key centre-half Craig Halkett through suspension.\n\n\"We are top of the league for a reason - because we have been good,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to be honest and say, going down to 10 men the other night, made the whole evening far more challenging than it needed to be.\n\n\"When we have lost this season, it's been by the odd goal or penalty kicks. The bar's been raised and everybody expects so much from us in every game.\"\n\nWhile Hearts have indeed been \"competitive\", their cause has not been helped by red cards for goalkeeper Alexander Schwolow, midfielder Beni Beningime and then Halkett in recent weeks.\n\nHowever, McInnes insisted: \"It is a concentration thing, not a discipline thing.\"\n\nHe knows they cannot afford any more of that, or the \"slow start\" he blames for December's derby defeat, and dismisses suggestions that his side might be feeling extra pressure from an improving Old Firm.\n\nRangers are now only three points adrift, and only three behind on goal difference, while reigning champions Celtic are three further back with a game in hand.\n\n\"We've been top of the league for four and a half months, so no extra anxiety,\" McInnes said.\n\n\"Every game is important. We've got 13 cup finals.\n\n\"We've got three home games out of the next four. We've had some tough fixtures and we have some good fixtures coming up for us to show our strength.\"\n\nMcInnes thought, with injuries forcing changes against St Mirren, \"there was a wee bit lack of energy because some players have maybe not played as much recently\".\n\nHowever, it would not force him into starts for fit-again record signing Eduardo Ague in midfield, or January forward arrivals Rogers Mato and Islam Chesnokov.\n\n\"I get the clamour for these players to be involved,\" McInnes said. \"There is nobody more excited when you sign players and a manager wants to bring players who are ready, but they're not ready and we're trying hard to get them ready.\n\n\"When you sign players in January when their leagues finish in November then it's difficult to get them up to speed and Scottish football is more intense, but hopefully they can have a positive influence between now and the end of the season.\"\n\nGiven their own injuries and January business, Hibs' starting line-up could have a completely different look to the one that emerged from the Easter Road tunnel last time out against Hearts.\n\nWith Scotland striker Kieron Bowie sold to Hellas Verona, Dane Scarlett made an immediate impact on loan from Tottenham Hotspur by setting up the opener against United, while Ante Suto, the forward bought from Slaven Belupo, replaced him to score the stoppage-time winner.\n\nMcInnes, though, expects a similar \"structure\" to Hibs' counter-attacking style and is predicting \"no real surprises\" from counterpart Gray.\n\nThe Hibs boss is also expecting more of the same - the kind of derby that is one of the key selling points for his club - and thinks his new arrivals will be relishing the opportunity.\n\n\"League position, division you're in, it doesn't matter, it's the Edinburgh derby and brilliant games to look forward to, brilliant game to be involved in,\" Gray said.\n\n\"At the same time, you don't want to get carried away with it, you need to be calming the chaos.\"\n\nDespite a 1-0 defeat on their last visit to Tynecastle in October, Hibs have managed to do that in winning three of the most recent four derbies.\n\nGray, though, dismisses the suggestion that the win is more important to Hearts this time round.\n\n\"I understand why you would say that, because of the league situation, but we've got our own objectives and targets,\" he said, pointing out that a win would lift Hibs to within one point of Motherwell in fourth.\n\n\"The derby is the derby. The bragging rights for your supporters.\"\n\nGray is well aware of the challenge of facing a side with genuine title aspirations.\n\n\"They have put themselves in a fantastic position,\" he said. \"That doesn't happen by accident at all.\n\n\"It's not as if we're only five or six games into the league or even one round of fixtures.\"\n\nGray expects a typical derby: \"It's very fast, it's very ferocious and played in a brilliant atmosphere.\"\n\nThis time, though, the result could go a long way to deciding the destiny of the Scottish title.\n\nHearts have gone two home games without a win, while Hibs have won once in six away games, losing their latest two.\n\nHearts ended a four-game home run without beating Hibs with their 1-0 success in October.\n\nHearts have only lost one of their last eight home games against Hibs in the Premiership, winning three.\n\nHibs have won three of the last four Edinburgh derbies, as many as their previous 19 top-flight meetings with Hearts beforehand.\n\nHearts are unbeaten in their last 14 home league games, winning 10, since a 1-0 defeat by Dundee in April - their longest unbeaten home run in the top-flight since 2004, when they went 16 without losing – the 15th of which was a 2-1 win over Hibs.\n\nSince Christmas Day, only Rangers (22) have earned more points in the Premiership than Hibs (14), who have won four and lost just one of seven league games in this time (D2).\n\nSince his debut for the club in July 2022, Hearts have only won six of the 20 league games in which absent striker Lawrence Shankland has not been in their starting XI (30%). This is compared to a 50%-win rate with the striker starting (60/119).",

    "fullText": "Arsenal's mental strength was questioned when their previous Premier League title run-ins faltered under Mikel Arteta, but one of their most famous fans feels their mindset will not be an issue this season.\n\nGolf superstar Ian Poulter, renowned for his own rock-solid self-belief and dominant performances under pressure in the Ryder Cup, feels Arteta has that side of things under control.\n\n\"I definitely don't need to give them a pep talk about it,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Mikel has got that nicely covered and they are in the right place. He really backs them up 100%, even if they make mistakes.\n\n\"Some of them have got some scar tissue of not getting over the line in the past but, mentally, you would hope Mikel has got the players more together than ever just by saying 'look you know you are good enough and we now have a deep enough squad, so you have every reason to go into every game more confident than you were before'.\"\n\nYou can watch Poulter play for Majesticks GC, external at the LIV Golf event in Adelaide, Australia from 12-15 February on TNT Sports.\n\nHe is also taking on BBC Sport football expert Chris Sutton - as well as the BBC readers and AI - by trying to predict the results of this week's midweek Premier League matches on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday.\n\nDo you agree with their scores? You can pick your own below.\n\nThe most popular scoreline selected for each game is used in the scoreboards and tables at the bottom of this page.\n\nA correct result (picking a win, draw or defeat) is worth 10 points. The exact score earns 40 points.\n\nBefore turning to golf, 50-year-old Poulter was a keen footballer and had trials with Arsenal's north London rivals Tottenham aged 13.\n\n\"I am so glad that never worked out!\" he explained. \"I had two left feet, and it turned out everyone else Spurs have signed since has got two left feet as well.\n\n\"As soon as I turned 16, my focus was 100% on golf, and every waking minute of the day was about me being my own boss and telling myself that if I worked hard enough I would achieve big things.\n\n\"But I do miss football. I miss the kind of team camaraderie it gave me and I think that's why I've always loved the Ryder Cup as much as I've loved it.\n\n\"It's because that's where I can get the team aspect, the bonding and learning to how to win as a team, as well as the disappointments that come with that as well - I've always loved the dynamic of that extra pressure.\n\n\"Obviously going out to play golf for yourself is fine and you can take the hit if it doesn't work out, but having that the extra weight of playing for your peers and your captain is nice - if you can deal with it.\"\n\nChris Sutton and Ian Poulter were speaking to BBC Sport's Chris Bevan.\n\nThe AI predictions were generated using Microsoft Copilot Chat - we simply asked the tool to 'predict this week's Premier League scores'.\n\nLeeds turned Chelsea over at Elland Road in December but they are not the same force away from home and this game smells of Chelsea revenge to me.\n\nThe Blues have made a good start under new boss Liam Rosenior, with four wins out of four in the league. Cole Palmer has hit form too, and they should win this fairly comfortably.\n\nIan's prediction: We annihilated Leeds a few days ago, and could have scored way more than the four we got. Chelsea look pretty solid at the moment too. 3-0\n\nEverton did well to fight back to beat Fulham late on at the weekend, but they could have been more than just a goal down at the break, while Bournemouth were unlucky only to draw with Aston Villa. They peppered Villa's goal with shots.\n\nI am going to go a bit leftfield here because although Everton beat Bournemouth earlier in the season, it was only thanks to a late deflected effort by Jack Grealish.\n\nI usually back Everton at home, and I'm usually wrong... so I am going to do something different this time. I am backing Bournemouth to pinch it.\n\nIan's prediction: It will be close but Everton to take it. 1-0\n\nTottenham Hotspur Stadium, 19:30\n\nTottenham captain Cristian Romero let his manager down with his red card against Manchester United, and now he is facing a four-game ban.\n\nIt's fine for Romero to be a motor mouth on social media, calling the club's recruitment \"disgraceful\", but he clearly needs to concentrate on his own game because he has been wild in the challenge again.\n\nFor a manager like Thomas Frank, who is under pressure, that is the last thing you need.\n\nPoor old Eddie Howe is feeling the heat at Newcastle too, though. We had callers in to 606 at the weekend saying it is time for a change - my reaction was 'what!?'.\n\nI really don't get that thinking at all, and not just because Howe's the guy who ended their long wait for a trophy, less than a year ago.\n\nHis squad is stretched now because of the Champions League and their run to the semi-finals of the Carabao Cup, and he also had everything around Alexander Isak's exit to deal with at the start of the season, when it wasn't his doing.\n\nHowe just hasn't been able to replace Isak, either. Yoane Wissa has taken a while to get up and running and Nick Woltemade is very different to Isak in that he likes to come to the ball all the time.\n\nPeople are saying a change of voice might help, but what about backing the guy who has given you so much happiness? I don't understand why you'd want him out.\n\nThis is a very difficult game to predict for various reasons, but we do know Spurs are poor at home and Newcastle aren't great away.\n\nI still think someone will win it, but I am going to sit in the middle anyway, and go for a draw.\n\nIan's prediction: A point apiece. 1-1\n\nBoth of these teams have found a bit of form, and West Ham's victory over Burnley was huge for them in their fight against the drop.\n\nIt seems Manchester United can do no wrong under Michael Carrick, who has often been linked with the West Ham job down the years but goes back to his old club looking for a fifth straight win.\n\nI think he will get it, too. We had some callers into 606 thinking United would be Arsenal's biggest challengers from now on, which seems a stretch, but there is no doubt they are on a bit of a high.\n\nThis is the sort of game where idiots like me can get sucked in and get on the Carrick bandwagon... I am wary, but I am still going to be positive and jump on board too.\n\nIan's prediction: I don't like to say it but United have won their past four games and they have actually looked really good. They have got the bit between their teeth. 0-2\n\nBrighton have only won one of their past 12 league games so the worry for them has to be that they will get sucked into the relegation scrap.\n\nIt was a 4-3 home defeat by Aston Villa in December that was the start of this poor run for Fabian Hurzeler's side, and I don't see it ending at Villa Park.\n\nI'm surprised that the Seagulls are struggling. I looked at their bench against Crystal Palace at the weekend and thought 'blimey, they've got a good squad' but they are underperforming and the fans seem really split on Hurzeler, and have been for a while.\n\nVilla were lucky to get a point against Bournemouth at the weekend and I couldn't believe how Lucas Digne just let Rayan run past him for the Cherries equaliser. He seemed to give up and it was astonishingly bad defending.\n\nUnai Emery's side have lost their past two home league games, against Everton and Brentford, which worries me.\n\nWill it be a hat-trick of home defeats, or will they come good again? I've got to back my old team, so I am going with my heart here and saying Morgan Rogers will make the difference.\n\nIan's prediction: Villa might stumble again. 0-0\n\nCrystal Palace's win over Brighton was a huge result for them and the Eagles are definitely not short of firepower - if anything they have got too many centre-forwards now, but that's a good problem to have.\n\nBurnley have had it though - I thought that before they lost at home to West Ham on Saturday, but there can't be any doubt they are going down now.\n\nI don't think the Clarets will get anything here, either, but their fans seem to have turned on manager Scott Parker which I really don't like.\n\nThis is the guy who got them up but because the other promoted sides, Sunderland and Leeds, are having better seasons, that has gone against him.\n\nJust on the eyes, whenever I've watched them, Burnley have been competitive and have been in games.\n\nI just think there needs to be a bit of patience from their supporters, but of course they are entitled to their opinion.\n\nIan's prediction: Burnley really need a win but they won't get one. 1-0\n\nWas Sunday's late comeback to win at Anfield the game that will spark Manchester City's title bid?\n\nTime will tell, but I am not convinced. I still think the issues that saw City fall behind in the first place will still cost them in future games too.\n\nFair play to Pep Guardiola's side for turning things around with six minutes to go, because their record at Anfield was so poor and a point would not have been enough for them.\n\nBut I just don't see this City team controlling games any\n\nSunday was no different. They were getting mauled in the second half by wave after wave of Liverpool attacks, before the chaos at the end. Gianluigi Donnarumma's save was a big moment and I was delighted that Erling Haaland stuck his penalty away because he's captain of my fantasy team and that gave me a good score.\n\nAs a neutral, I hope the title race lasts until the final few weeks of the season but I just feel like City will drop too many more points before then.\n\nFulham are a good footballing side and almost got something from City at Craven Cottage in December - I was there, and City only just held on for a 5-4 win.\n\nMarco Silva's side have been hard done by in their past couple of games because they had plenty of chances in their defeat at Manchester United, then could have been well ahead at the break before they lost to Everton too.\n\nThis time? Well I think Fulham will score at Etihad Stadium too, and they are due a bit of a break. Maybe they will get it against City, but I am still going for a home win.\n\nIan's prediction: City will win this one. 2-0\n\nI was at Elland Road on Friday and Nottingham Forest were insipid in their defeat by Leeds - they were really flat.\n\nThis is a real pressure game for Forest, and in many ways it is the worst possible fixture for them. Wolves are hopeless so, if Forest win, their fans will say 'well we should be beating them, because they are rubbish'.\n\nLose or even drop points, however, then you can imagine the atmosphere and the mood of the fans, and the pressure that will put on the players.\n\nI don't mean pressure in terms of any calls to sack Forest boss Sean Dyche, but the negativity there will be around the team, when the mood of the fans can be massive when a team is fighting the drop.\n\nLeeds are a great example of that, actually. Just look at the positivity at Elland Road recently and how that has helped Leeds in the past few weeks. It was a very different story when the fans were unhappy earlier in the season.\n\nAs for Wolves, well they are not under any pressure any more.\n\nThey are playing for pride which is totally different to Forest's situation, where every point counts - and this is going to be a nervy night for the home fans at the City Ground.\n\nIan's prediction: Forest to edge it. 1-0\n\nThe Liverpool fans seem to have had enough of Arne Slot, which again makes no sense to me. Just because they aren't going to win the title again doesn't mean they aren't building anything.\n\nIt seems that making the Champions League places is like the title used to be now - as in, if you don't make the Champions League then the manager has got to go. It drives me potty.\n\nI know Sunderland lost at Arsenal on Saturday but I still enjoyed their performance.\n\nThat might sound odd because they were beaten 3-0 but I still thought the Black Cats were competitive, and they were really physical too. They matched Arsenal for long spells of the game.\n\nSo, Liverpool will know what to expect when they try to become the first team to win at Stadium of Light this season, and this is going to be a very difficult game for them.\n\nSlot needs a positive result here, for Liverpool to keep in touch with the teams above them in the race for the top four. My only concern about Sunderland is whether they can bring that same physicality again, but I still don't think Liverpool will win.\n\nIan's prediction: I just have a feeling Liverpool can sneak this one. 1-2\n\nCan Brentford produce another shock after beating Aston Villa and Newcastle in the past couple of weeks? No, they can't.\n\nKeith Andrews has done an incredible job as Bees boss and they will make life difficult for Arsenal because they are well organised and dangerous on the break.\n\nBut I still think Arsenal will win because of their sheer power that means they can run through anything.\n\nThis might not be the most entertaining game to watch, because Brentford will sit in and defend, and counter.\n\nArsenal will deal with that, and then find a way of scoring. A deflected goal will probably decide it.\n\nPeople might say the way they win games is not pretty but there is still a lot to admire about Arsenal and, in the end, no matter what anyone says, it is all about winning, isn't it?\n\nArsenal are very good at winning games, and I am expecting them to win this one too. In my opinion, they will go on and win the title too, because of the quality of their squad and how good they are defensively.\n\nAs much as you want beauty to triumph over a beast, City are still far too flaky for that to happen.\n\nIan on Arsenal's title hopes: I feel pretty confident, even with the couple of slip-ups we've had in the past month. We've got the strength in depth we need where other players can step up when we are missing players through injury.\n\nIf Viktor Gyokeres can start filling the onion bag up and Bukayo Saka can bag a few as well then that would be nice, but we look so good from set-pieces anyway. Our scoring stats from open play could be a bit of an issue but as long as we are scoring and winning then it doesn't really matter.\n\nIan's prediction: This is going to be a non-stressful win. We will be 2-0 up, concede a stupid goal but then finish the game off. 1-3\n\nChris and AI both got four correct results with no exact scores from the 10 games in week 25, giving them a total of 40 points apiece.\n\nHis guest, Gladiators star Apollo, was right about Manchester City's win at Anfield [everyone else went for a 2-2 draw] and ended up on 70 points thanks to four correct results including one exact score.\n\nBut the win went to the collective efforts of the BBC readers, with five correct results and one exact score [Bournemouth's 1-1 draw with Aston Villa] for a tally of 80 points.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Freestyle skier Kirsty Muir missed out on Great Britain's first medal of the 2026 Winter Olympics by the narrowest of margins with a fourth-place finish in the women's slopestyle.\n\nMuir scored 76.05 points with a brilliant third run, finishing only 0.41 behind Canadian bronze medallist Megan Oldham at Livigno Snow Park.\n\nHaving fallen on the penultimate jump of her opening run, Muir - who had qualified third - sat in sixth after her second.\n\nBut despite a vastly improved performance on her final attempt, a crestfallen Muir was left wanting more on the biggest stage.\n\n\"I put it out there on every run,\" the 21-year-old told BBC Sport.\n\n\"I was so proud to put one down.

I'm going to go through this, accept it and try and find the positives that I can from it, and then completely reset because the big air is just a completely different competition.\"\n\nFour years ago in Beijing, Scotland's Muir was GB's youngest competitor at 17 and finished fifth in the big air and eighth in the slopestyle.\n\nAfter those Games, Muir achieved three World Cup podiums, but in December 2023 an MRI scan showed she had been competing with a fully torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL).\n\nAn operation followed in early 2024, as well as surgery on a shoulder problem that had troubled her for some time.\n\nEleven months later she was back on snow, and her maiden World Cup gold arrived in Tignes in March 2025.\n\nTwo more have followed this season, as well as slopestyle gold and big air silver at the invitation-only X Games on the eve of the Olympics.\n\nMuir was likely to be back at the snow park to watch team-mate and close friend Mia Brookes tackle the snowboard big air final, which starts at 18:30 GMT.\n\nBrookes, one of the biggest names in her sport as a world champion and two-time X Games gold medallist, qualified in third.\n\nCurlers Bruce Mouat and Jen Dodds could secure a place in the gold medal mixed doubles final when they face Sweden in the semi-final in Milan from 17:05.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "The new Cadillac F1 team launches a split livery in an advert costing a reputed £7.3m broadcast during the Super Bowl - and are being sued over it by Hollywood director Michael Bay.",
    "fullText": "The new Cadillac team have launched a unique split livery in an advert costing a reputed £7.3m that was broadcast during the Super Bowl.\n\nCadillac Formula 1 chief executive officer Dan Towriss said the launch, which also included a model of the team's car being unveiled in New York's Times Square, was a \"tremendous event for us\" and a \"momentous day\".\n\nThe livery is white on black on one side of the car and black on white on the other, a design decision that has raised eyebrows among other teams because F1 rules dictate car colour schemes should look \"substantially similar on both sides\".\n\nA spokesperson said team principal Graeme Lowdon and team manager Pete Crolla had sought clarification from governing body the FIA and had \"indicated this design was within the rules as long as the design and branding was similar from both sides, which we are comfortable and confident it is\".\n\nThe British American Racing (BAR) team fell foul of this area of the rulebook in their debut season in 1999, when they tried to run their cars in two different cigarette liveries.\n\nAfter an intervention by then FIA president Max Mosley, a compromise was reached whereby the cars ran in identical split liveries. The current rules language dates from that dispute.\n\nNorris confidence 'even higher' as he eyes title defence\n\nCadillac's entry is the first time US car giant General Motors, their parent company, has competed in F1.\n\nTowriss said Cadillac were trying to make a statement as they took their first steps in F1.\n\n\"You can say we're competing against the other teams, but really Formula 1 is competing against other sports,\" he said.\n\n\"You're competing against the Super Bowl. You're competing against what's going on in stick and ball sports, Premier League soccer, all the things that are happening at the Olympics. There's the Fifa World Cup this year. So there's a lot going on.\n\n\"And so I think as teams we need to continue to find innovative ways to draw that interest, do storytelling and reach out to fans.\"\n\nBoth Towriss and Lowdon have emphasised that Cadillac face an uphill struggle in F1 this year.\n\nTowriss said: \"We're a brand new team. So we're going to have have triumphant days and we're going to have some carnage along the way as well. There's just a lot to learn in this first year.\"\n\nHe said the team have not set themselves a specific performance target for the season.\n\n\"For me, points would be kind of an arbitrary target,\" said Towriss. \"I think I want to look at beating teams, beating cars on track, and how many cars can we pass in year one in moving up the grid.\n\n\"And so I think that's really how we're thinking about it. And then, secondly, it's going to be the rate of development on this car as well. We obviously have a long-term outlook for the team.\"\n\nCadillac meanwhile have confirmed the accuracy of a Rolling Stone report, external that they are being sued by Hollywood film director Michael Bay, who claims the team stole his ideas for the advert having approached him for input and then ended contact with him.\n\nTowriss said Bay's actions were \"disappointing\", adding \"all of the creative [work] was done well in advance of ever speaking with him\", and he was \"confident it'll be resolved amicably\".\n\nBay directed films The Rock, Pearl Harbor and Armageddon.\n\nA Cadillac F1 spokesperson said: \"Michael Bay is a cinematic genius and we talked with him about directing our Super Bowl ad. But after two meetings it became clear he couldn't meet our timeline, and there ultimately wasn't a path forward.\n\n\"It's unclear why he's bringing this claim, since the concept and creative were already developed and we were only exploring him as a director.\n\n\"It's also unusual to raise this now, given the ad hasn't even been released. We're confident this will be resolved appropriately. Even so, we still admire Michael Bay's creative brilliance and would welcome the opportunity to work together in the future.\"",

    "description": "BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team look at why one figure skating coach was seen wearing two different national team jackets.",
    "fullText": "Eagle-eyed viewers of figure skating may have thought they were seeing double when French coach Benoit Richaud was pictured wearing the jackets of both Canada and Georgia within the space of 15 minutes on Sunday evening.\n\nRichaud, 38, is a coach and choreographer who is working with 16 different skaters at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy, with those athletes coming from a total of 13 different countries.\n\nCoaching this combination of athletes from different countries in the same event led to Richaud being caught on camera wearing two different team jackets during the team event final in a short space of time.\n\nHe was first pictured in the crowd sporting a jacket of the Georgia national team in support of Nika Egadze.\n\nLess than 15 minutes later, Richaud was again spotted in the crowd - only this time he was wearing a Canada team jacket to support Stephen Gogolev, another one of his athletes.\n\n\"It's an organisation. It's going to be fast,\" Richaud told BBC's More Than the Score podcast.\n\n\"It's actually very demanding emotionally because, you know, depending on [how it goes]. Let's imagine everything is fine and beautiful and everyone skates good, very easy.\n\n\"If one skates bad, then the other one skates good, you have this peak of emotion that is very difficult to express because it's something like when you are with your skater, you are fully with them.\n\n\"Thank God they are not one after the other one... then it's very, very difficult.\n\n\"People laugh because I'm always wearing black. And now everyone is like, how it's possible we see Benoit with different colours?\"\n\nThere are a lot of logistics involved in switching between coaching and supporting athletes from different nations in quick succession - including the ability to change which jacket Richaud is wearing at quick notice.\n\n\"I usually put everything in the dressing room of the skater,\" the French choreographer said. \"Usually, I'm not allowed but they let me put some stuff [in there]. They very friendly.\n\n\"If not, we always have like a team leader or the manager of the national team who keeps the jackets and they give it to me.\"\n\nAmong Richaud's skaters also include Spanish athlete Tomas-Llorenc Guarino Sabate, who has become popular at the Olympics due to his performance in tribute to the Minions films.\n\nRichaud's popularity as a coach is no surprise when you look at his track record to date.\n\nAs a skater, he won the Junior French Championships while skating in partnership with Elodie Brouiller in 2005-06.\n\nThree years later, Richaud also finished third at senior level at this competition in partnership with Canada's Terry Findlay.\n\nBut it is as a coach and choreographer where Richaud has found more success.\n\nAt the 2024 ISU Skating Awards, he was named Best Figure Skater Choreographer, an award he was also shortlisted for in 2025.\n\nOf the five skaters in Sunday's men's final, two being coached by Richaud is a testament to how he is rated in the sport.\n\nWhile all athletes are representing their own countries, in figure skating they tend to be coached individually rather than per nation.\n\nRichaud is a prime example of this, with his 16 athletes coming from 13 different countries.\n\nRules allow coaches to work with athletes from multiple different nations, even if they are competing against each other.\n\nThis article is the latest from BBC Sport's Ask Me Anything team.\n\nWhat is the difference between bobsleigh, skeleton and luge?\n\nWhich country is the most successful at the Winter Olympics?\n\nHow are points scored in snowboard big air?\n\nWhen and where will 2030 Winter Olympics be held?",

    "fullText": "Seven-weight world champion Amanda Serrano has said Jake Paul was wrong to call Puerto Rican singer Bad Bunny a \"fake American\" following his performance during the Super Bowl half-time show.\n\nPuerto Rican Serrano was the first boxer to be signed by Paul's Most Valuable Promotions in 2021 and was handed a \"lifetime\" contract by the company in 2025.\n\nBad Bunny, whose real name is Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, performed a 14-minute set at Levi's Stadium in California as the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots.\n\nPaul said in a post on X that he turned off the half-time show because he could not support Bad Bunny and suggested that the six-time Grammy Award winner \"publicly hates America\".\n\nWBA and WBO featherweight champion Serrano responded with her own lengthy statement, saying she was \"celebrating with awe\" at how Bad Bunny represented her culture before addressing Paul directly.\n\n\"I am proud to be Puerto Rican, and I am proud to be an American citizen,\" Serrano wrote.\n\n\"Puerto Ricans are not \"fake Americans\". We are citizens who have contributed to this country in every field, from military service to sports, business, science, and the arts, and our identity and citizenship deserve respect.\n\n\"I would not have the opportunities I have without the support and belief that Most Valuable Promotions and Jake Paul showed in me, and I will always be grateful for the role they have played in helping change my life and in elevating women's boxing.\n\n\"At the same time, I want to be clear: I do not agree with statements that question the legitimacy or identity of Puerto Rican people, and I cannot support that characterisation. It is wrong.\"\n\nPuerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States. Puerto Ricans cannot vote in the election to decide the president but they do have American citizenship.\n\nPaul later said his use of the word fake had been \"misinterpreted\".\n\n\"He's not a fake citizen obviously bc [because] he's Puerto Rican and I love Puerto Rico and all Americans who support the country,\" Paul posted on X.\n\n\"Moreso Bunny is fake bc of his values and criticism of our great country.\"\n\nPaul made his professional boxing debut in 2020 and has won 12 of his 14 fights but lost his most high-profile bout to Anthony Joshua in December.\n\nHis brother Logan said he did not agree with his sibling's comments and that \"Puerto Ricans are Americans\".\n\nClaressa Shields, a five-weight world champion, urged Paul to \"do better\".\n\n\"Puerto Ricans are not fake citizens,\" Shields posted on X.\n\n\"You would think that you of all people would support this as you have so many Puerto Rican women under your umbrella.\n\n\"What's happening with ICE is terrible and we shouldn't want to see harm done to anyone who is a part of America & a minority! Do better Jake. This isn't right.\"\n\nAccording to streaming service Spotify, Bad Bunny was the world's most-played artist in 2025 and made history by becoming the first musician to perform a Super Bowl half-time show entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old made two statements in English, one with a billboard message reading \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" and the other \"Together, We Are America\" written on a football that he held.\n\nPresident Donald Trump also criticised the half-time show on his Truth social media platform, saying it was an \"affront to the greatness of America\".\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Bangladesh have requested that Pakistan end their planned boycott of their T20 World Cup match against India, opening the door for the fixture to be played on 15 February as scheduled.\n\nThe match, the biggest and most lucrative in cricket, has been in doubt since the Pakistan government advised its team not to take the field against their long-time rivals.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif said that initial decision was made to \"support\" Bangladesh, who had a request for their matches to be moved out of India rejected and subsequently pulled out of the tournament.\n\nBut, after talks between officials at the Pakistan Cricket Board, the International Cricket Council and the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) in Lahore on Sunday, BCB president Ameenul Islam requested the match go ahead \"for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem\".\n\n\"We are deeply moved by Pakistan's efforts to go above and beyond in supporting Bangladesh during this period. Long may our brotherhood flourish,\" he added.\n\nThe match is scheduled to take place in the city of Colombo in Sri Lanka, the co-hosts for the tournament with India.\n\nPakistan will forfeit the points from the group-stage match should it not be played but the team's absence from the tournament would also have longer-term consequences for cricket.\n\nIt could lead to disputes over the ICC's current rights deals and continued uncertainty would likely impact future agreements, with the current TV deals set to run out after the 2027 World Cup.\n\nMany of the smaller cricketing nations rely on the money distributed by the ICC, so any cut in revenue would likely hit such countries hardest.\n\n\"Following my short visit to Pakistan yesterday and given the forthcoming outcomes of our discussions, I request Pakistan to play the ICC T20 World Cup game on 15 February against India for the benefit of the entire cricket ecosystem,\" Islam said.\n\nWhile stopping short of confirming the match will go ahead, the ICC released a statement on Monday evening confirming Bangladesh will not be sanctioned for their boycott.\n\nIt also said Bangladesh will host an ICC event between 2028 and the start of the 2031 World Cup.\n\n\"The ICC, PCB and BCB, along with other members, remain committed to continued dialogue, cooperation and constructive engagement in the best interests of the sport,\" a statement said.\n\n\"All stakeholders acknowledge that the spirit of this understanding is to protect the integrity of the game and preserve unity within the cricket fraternity.\"\n\nThere were no details on what event Bangladesh would host. All men's events have been confirmed up until 2031, with Bangladesh already scheduled to co-host the 2031 World Cup with India.\n\nThe hosts of women's tournaments have been chosen up to 2027, while the ICC also holds Under-19 World Cups.\n\nThe PCB has been contacted for comment.\n\nWhat next in Pakistan-India controversy as ICC confirm forfeit stance?",

    "title": "Late goals are destroying Liverpool's season and solution isn't obvious",
    "description": "Why have Liverpool gone from mentality monsters to a side there for the taking?",
    "fullText": "It was early in the season that Liverpool supporters noticed a subtle change at the club's training ground.\n\nAnd with each game that passed, the collection of images grew. First there is a picture of Federico Chiesa celebrating his 88th-minute goal against Bournemouth on the opening day of the Premier League season, a goal that put Liverpool back into the lead after the Cherries had come back from 2-0 down to draw level. Mohamed Salah would score in stoppage time to put the result beyond doubt.\n\nNext to it was placed an image of teenager Rio Ngumoha scoring a dramatic winner in the 100th minute at St James' Park as Newcastle were beaten 3-2. A week later and Dominik Szoboszlai scored a free-kick in the 83rd minute against Arsenal, and the following weekend Salah scored a 95th-minute penalty at Burnley - a pair of back-to-back 1-0 wins, two more photos on the wall.\n\nAfter five games, Liverpool had 15 points on the board and a whole set of images for the players to take inspiration from. The Reds were top of the league with a 100% record and favourites to retain their title.\n\nThrow in a 92nd-minute winner against Atletico Madrid in the Champions League - another game in which Liverpool had surrendered a two-goal lead - and from the outside at least, things were looking good for Arne Slot's side. The Dutchman put his side's knack of winning games with late goals down to self-belief and fitness.\n\nBut the cracks were showing in the goals his team were conceding and now, five months on, there are precious few new images to line the walls of Liverpool's training ground.\n\nThe Reds' habit of scoring late winners has turned on its head, and it is they who are finding themselves conceding late on. Liverpool are now there for the taking.\n\nIn Liverpool's three league games that followed their golden start, they faced Crystal Palace, Chelsea and Manchester United and conceded winning goals in the 84th minute or later each time.\n\nAnd when Erling Haaland dispatched his injury-time penalty at Anfield on Sunday, it was the fourth time that Liverpool had conceded an injury-time winner in the league this season. No team in a single Premier League campaign has ever conceded more.\n\nOnly three teams (Burnley, Leeds and Newcastle) have conceded more goals in the final 10 minutes plus injury time of games than Liverpool (10) this season and no team has lost more points than Liverpool (eight) from those goals.\n\nThose eight points would put them level with Aston Villa in third, but instead Liverpool find themselves in sixth and four points behind Chelsea, who are fifth.\n\nOn occasions this season, Virgil van Dijk has used the word \"sloppy\" to describe Liverpool's struggles.\n\nAfter a 1-1 draw against Burnley in January, the Liverpool captain said: \"After 60 minutes, we started to become sloppy and it's not the first time. We have to address that.\"\n\nA few days later in Milan, that quote was put to left-back Milos Kerkez, who told BBC Sport that he agreed with Van Dijk's assessment.\n\n\"After 60-70 [minutes] we always lose focus and lose some tactical discipline. I don't know, we get tired, I am not sure whatever it is, but I agree with that.\"\n\nOne of the big reasons Slot was brought in to succeed Jurgen Klopp was his impressive ability to keep his players fit. Of the shortlisted managers, only Ruben Amorim boasted a better record.\n\nThe Dutchman opted for a style of training that was less intense than what players may have been used to.\n\nSlot had worked at Feyenoord with Ruben Peeters who followed him to Liverpool as the first team's lead performance coach. The pair tailored training to specific players, altering the intensity based on Liverpool's schedule and demands of upcoming games.\n\nSessions became longer but less intense and, on match days, Slot's Liverpool played less intensely out of possession than Klopp's teams did.\n\nAll of these factors, built upon a squad that was conditioned to play under Klopp, combined to leave them remarkably injury-free last season, resulting in Liverpool being crowned Premier League champions.\n\nThey have not been so fortunate this season.\n\nLiverpool have looked to break teams down by initially committing bodies to the box, an approach that has left them vulnerable to counter-attacks.\n\nTeams have deliberately looked to play long against Liverpool, which has also introduced more end-to-end running and duelling. The Liverpool players have physically struggled with this.\n\nSlot has since gone for a more measured and defensively solid set-up which has reduced how end-to-end games are, but Liverpool struggle to score early.\n\nThe Premier League is home to the most sprints and high-intensity runs in Europe. Opponents can afford to minimise how much they run through a season by spending large parts of the game in their pragmatic low blocks.\n\nHowever, Liverpool's fans are likely to want to see high-octane games from their side.\n\nWith an uptick in soft tissue injuries, there is a worry the training methods and on-field tactics described here have been sub-optimal this season when compared to last season, with Liverpool's players dropping off in the latter parts of games.\n\nBetween wanting to appease fans, ensuring his players stay fit, wanting to score early and aiming to stay solid at the back, the Liverpool boss has a difficult balancing act on his hands.\n\nWhen Van Dijk spoke again on Sunday, the response was telling. Liverpool can't put a pin on it. As Slot repeatedly says, it's always a \"different goal\".\n\nThis time, the cause was one of Liverpool's most experienced players, goalkeeper Alisson, making a mistake as he fouled Matheus Nunes.\n\n\"I think you can't compare all of the goals. I think maybe you can compare the Palace goal and the Bournemouth goal, but this one you can't compare with the others. But the fact is that we conceded that late on and I keep saying it but we have to do better in this,\" said Van Dijk.\n\nAsked if Liverpool were guilty of being sloppy again, Van Dijk added: \"I don't know in this moment. It's difficult for me to say that. I don't have the whole game completely in front of me right now so it's something we will discuss [on Monday].\"\n\nGiven Liverpool's injury crisis, the lack of depth on the bench is playing a part too. Manchester City were able to bring on Rayan Cherki who influenced the dynamic of Pep Guardiola's attack, while Slot's first substitution was Curtis Jones for Cody Gakpo in the 85th minute, before throwing on Chiesa in injury-time.\n\nAnd that is precisely where Liverpool are at right now. A side aware of their cracks but unable to paper over them, never mind fix them.\n\nUntil Sunday, the Reds were unbeaten in 109 home league games when scoring the opening goal (W98 D11). It was the latest they have ever led in a Premier League game yet gone on to lose, with Bernardo Silva's 84th-minute equaliser followed by Haaland's late penalty.\n\nThe reality is that Szoboszlai's stunning free-kick for the opening goal on Sunday should be another image on that wall in Kirkby. In the end, it was worth nothing as Liverpool again failed to see the game out.\n\nIn Premier League history, no team has ever scored more injury-time winners than Liverpool. They stand clear with 47, ahead of Arsenal (36) and Manchester United (34).\n\nLiverpool have been renowned for late drama across their illustrious history. Yet in the here and now, they're making the wrong kind of history.\n\nAs Slot said on Sunday: \"We are getting almost used to conceding a goal in extra time.\"\n\n'Killjoy' - did VAR get late drama in Liverpool v Man City right?\n\nMan City fight back for dramatic late win at Liverpool",

    "fullText": "He has been jailed, tracked and threatened by China’s government. What was it like pay a visit home? As he publishes a polemic about surveillance and state control, the artist relives a momentous trip to see his mother\n\nAi Weiwei is talking me through the decision-making process before his first visit to China in over a decade. The artist, known around the world as the most famous critic of the Chinese communist regime, had to do some fraught arithmetic before deciding to head back home.\n\nBefore boarding a flight with his son, who had never met the artist’s elderly mother, Ai thought back to his time in detention when his captors told him he would spend the next 13 years in custody on bogus charges: “They said, ‘When you come out, your son won’t recognise you.’ That was very heavy and really the only moment that touched me.”\n\nHe ended up spending several months in captivity. Lao, his son, is now 17. Ai says Lao doesn’t really need his guidance any more so he decided to book their flights and roll the dice. “People said, ‘Are you scared?’ I said, ‘No, why should I be scared?’ I’m Chinese. I have a Chinese passport. I’m entitled to go back and see my mum. So I went back.”\n\nWelcome to the life of Ai Weiwei. For most people, returning home doesn’t involve weighing up the risk of whether you’ll see close family ever again, but that’s the reality for a 68-year-old whose whole existence has been shaped by authoritarianism and the struggle against it.\n\nHis trip to China went well. He ended up being interviewed at the airport and released after a couple of hours into a country whose smells, sights and sounds were soothing to him. Ai described the journey as being like “a phone call suddenly reconnecting”. Today, he’s more poetic, describing it as “a piece of jade broken that you can put back together because it matches very well. Everything’s so familiar: the light, the temperature, the people.”\n\nAi is meeting me in the London offices of his publisher to talk about his new book, On Censorship, a 90-page polemic on the nature of state control, AI and surveillance. The man certainly knows about these things. Born in Beijing in 1957, he grew up in labour camps in north-west China following the exile of his father, the poet Ai Qing. In 2011, he was detained for 81 days in a 170 sq ft windowless prison because of his own activism. Upon his release, he was tracked, interrogated and threatened by the Chinese state; then his passport was returned in 2015 and he began a life in exile. He currently divides his time between Lisbon, Berlin and Cambridge.\n\nHis artworks are as dramatic as his backstory. An army of 1,600 Chinese artisans created 100m hand-painted porcelain “seeds” that were scattered over the floor of Tate Modern’s Turbine Hall in London 16 years ago. He cloaked Berlin’s Konzerthaus in 14,000 fluorescent orange lifejackets worn by refugees; and made a film dedicated to the children who died in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. That direct challenge to the official state narrative made him “the most dangerous person in China”.\n\nHis upcoming work, at Aviva Studios in Manchester, involves 30 tonnes of buttons, which were saved from a London factory that was closing down and smuggled into China to be turned into huge hanging artworks by craftspeople.\n\nThe book is a startling read, arguing that those in the west misunderstand the nature of censorship. He defines it as “the exercise of power over intellectual space”, both “an indispensable tool of mental enslavement and a fundamental source of political corruption”. It is not just authoritarian regimes, he warns. Liberal societies think that censorship is rare, “but people forget that even on sunny days, shadows are inevitable”.\n\nSome of the arguments are perplexing. In a section about the limitations of AI, the artist refers to the selfie he took with AfD leader Alice Weidel in 2018. He says AI decided that the image, which is real, must have been fake because the pair seemed to be on opposite ends of the political spectrum. At the time of the selfie, Weidel, whose grandfather was a Nazi, was considered to be in the more moderate wing of the far-right party, but since becoming leader has called for “large-scale repatriations” of foreigners, saying the country’s focus on the Holocaust is akin to a “guilt cult”.\n\nDoes Ai regret the selfie? He tells me that on many issues, her political demands “could be wrong”, but she’s still “more rational than other political opponents in Germany”. What about her anti-immigrant rhetoric – isn’t that anathema to him? “Some states don’t even accept one [immigrant] and Germany accepts 1.2 million, which is a pretty generous decision,” he replies. “So if they change the policy and they want to limit it, then there is nothing wrong.”\n\nHe’s also impressed by the fact that Weidel “openly wants Germany to be more independent from American influence”. He adds: “I think those are some of the things that we need to do.” Those who know German politics would find that argument surprising because the AfD are seen as the party who are closest to Trump and nearly all parties in the country want more independence from the US. A ringing endorsement of someone at the outermost reaches of far-right European politics might cause a few double takes, and there are more surprises.\n\nAi’s attitude to China has shifted dramatically. The nation, he said recently, is “in an upward phase,” pointing to the technological advancements made and increased personal freedoms. The west, however, struggles to “sustain its own logic”, has lost its “ethical authority” and has “descended into something barely recognisable”.\n\nAlthough a quick glance across the Atlantic at America in the age of ICE raids does somewhat make his point, he means Europe, too. So is the Chinese regime’s most famous critic now toeing the party line? “My position with China started before I could recognise myself as an individual. I grew up in this black hole with my father,” he says, pointing to a picture on his iPhone of a desolate location in north-west China.\n\nHe’s not angry exactly, but the suggestion that he’s softened on the Chinese government has touched a nerve. “I still have a Chinese passport. My mum is still Chinese. So that’s my only relationship to China,” he says. “I’m not nostalgic. I’m not patriotic.” What about the claim that the west embraces censorship? Is that his experience in the UK? “I cannot get into details,” he says cryptically. “But I feel the same kind of surveillance, same kind of censorship in the west.”\n\nPressed for an example, he tells me a story about the Royal Academy in London, an institution that gave him a landmark exhibition in 2015 and made him an honorary member in 2011 following his detainment in China. In November 2023, an exhibition of new works to be shown at the Lisson Gallery was pulled after he posted a tweet that began: “The sense of guilt around the persecution of the Jewish people has been, at times, transferred to offset the Arab world.” The tweet was deleted, with the artist telling journalists his show had “effectively [been] cancelled”.\n\nIn the aftermath, a vote was then held at the RA to determine whether his membership should be revoked because of accusations that the post was antisemitic. “I don’t have the intention of an antisemite. My best friends, they’re all Jewish people,” says Ai. “I tweeted millions of tweets on Twitter, but [how is it that] this tweet can cause such trouble? Then they said the procedure is to let the Academicians vote.”\n\nHis peers supported him and he won the vote. Ai was then asked to write an article about freedom of speech for the RA’s magazine, which he did, arguing: “Speaking the truth and insisting on one’s own perspective is dangerous and may come at a heavy price. Books may go unpublished, exhibitions may be closed, concerts cancelled.”\n\nAfter he sent it, there was silence. Then he says the RA claimed they didn’t have room to run the piece. For him, this is the censorship in the west, which he argues in On Censorship can be “more covert, more deceptive and more corrosive” than in authoritarian regimes. “I have several cases like this,” Ai adds. “Happens in Britain and in Germany.”\n\nThe RA disputes this account, claiming the decision to drop the piece was made before Ai submitted it. A spokesperson added: “Plurality of voices, tolerance and free thinking are at the core of what we stand for and seek to protect.”\n\nI wonder how Ai feels about the world in 2026. His new book paints it as a place without refuge for those who value self-expression and freedom of speech. “I think today we are living in a complicated world, where life is more like a shattered mirror,” he says. “It reflects the reality, but the reality can be a broken reality.”\n\nDid his trip to China restore his faith in humanity? There’s a pause. “If we were in the time of the Tang dynasty, someone like me would go back and write beautiful poetry,” he says, smiling. “But not today. I just take a few selfies.”",

    "fullText": "Newly released documents detail convicted sex offender’s early backing of bitcoin and Coinbase\n\nMillions of files related to Jeffrey Epstein have brought to light his ties to the highest echelons of the cryptocurrency industry.\n\nDocuments published last week by the US Department of Justice reveal Epstein bankrolled the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin, the world’s largest cryptocurrency, during its nascent stages; he also invested $3m in Coinbase in 2014, the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the US, and cut a check that same year to Blockstream, a prominent bitcoin-focused technology firm. Both crypto startups accepted Epstein’s investments in 2014 – six years after his 2008 conviction in Florida for soliciting prostitution from a minor.\n\nDespite murmurings among crypto communities online about the need for a sector-level reckoning around the Epstein files’ revelations, most industry players predict few consequences for crypto companies or the sector writ large. Some see Epstein as a “skeptical investor” who pulled out of his crypto investments prematurely; others go so far as to claim Epstein was attempting to “undermine bitcoin”.\n\nThe crypto companies that secured Epstein’s investment have grown into multibillion-dollar giants, especially Coinbase, which went public on the Nasdaq in 2021, and whose co-founder, Brian Armstrong, has heavily influenced crypto regulation in the United States.\n\nEpstein’s 2014 investment in Coinbase was brokered by the crypto evangelist Brock Pierce, a former child actor and a co-founder of Tether, the world’s largest issuer of stablecoins, a kind of cryptocurrency whose value is typically pegged to a national currency.\n\nDocuments published by the justice department reveal Fred Ehrsam, a co-founder of Coinbase who spearheaded its fundraise, liaised with Pierce about Epstein’s investment in the company and sought to meet with Epstein “if convenient”. Additional filings suggest Epstein sold half of his shares to Pierce’s firm, Blockchain Capital, for $15m in 2018.\n\nA spokeswoman for Coinbase declined to comment; Pierce did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nEpstein’s financing of bitcoin’s development stemmed from his role as a donor to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Over the course of 20 years, MIT accepted more than $800,000 from Epstein, who also facilitated more than $7m in donations from other wealthy individuals.\n\nIn communications from 2015 between Joichi Ito, then director of MIT’s Media Lab, a tech-focused research institute, and Epstein, Ito wrote that Epstein’s “gift funds” were used to “underwrite” the launch of the Digital Currency Initiative, an offshoot of the Lab tasked with researching and developing open-source crypto technologies; in the same email thread, Ito explained that the Lab’s role was to serve as the “principal home and funding source” for bitcoin. The Digital Currency Initiative did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn 2014, Ito brokered Epstein’s investment in Blockstream, which builds bitcoin-focused tech solutions. Epstein made a $500,000 early-stage investment in the company through an investment fund he co-owned with Ito. Email communications reveal Blockstream’s co-founders, Adam Back and Austin Hill, were invited by Epstein to meet in St Thomas, close to Little Saint James, the private island Epstein owned.\n\nOn Twitter, Back claimed that Blockstream understood Epstein to be a “limited partner in Ito’s fund”, which later divested from Blockstream “due to a potential conflict of interest, and other concerns” – meaning that “Blockstream has no direct nor indirect financial connection with Jeffrey Epstein, or his estate”.\n\nIn communications with an Italian investor, Epstein noted that he “like[d]” Back. Hill continued communicating with Epstein into 2017, checking in with his “friend” following a storm in the Caribbean. “Just checking that your Island is OK,” reads the email thread’s subject line. Representatives for Blockstream and Hill did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLuke Dashjr, an early contributor to bitcoin’s development as well as to Blockstream, has called for Adam Back to resign from his role as Blockstream’s CEO over ties to Epstein. In an interview with the Guardian, Dashjr said Epstein’s interest in bitcoin – namely, his “attempts to undermine” bitcoin’s network, early-stage companies, and developers – was a sign that “evil men often seek to destroy what is good”.\n\nCharlotte Fang, the founder of Remilia, which makes NFTs and other crypto-based art, said “only unserious people might care” about Epstein’s investment in bitcoin and Coinbase; in the latter case, “only the financially unsophisticated” would assume that he had “any degree of influence over the direction” of the exchange, as his seven-figure investment was a small part of Coinbase’s fundraise.\n\n“Bitcoin is a decentralized technology that required no funding, and Epstein was evidently a skeptical investor, who got in later than I did, and exited earlier than he should have,” Fang said.\n\n“Generally speaking, retail consumers will not change their habits” around crypto following this recent release of Epstein files, according to Kadan Stadelmann of Komodo, a crypto platform. Investor practices, including their dependence on connections to cut checks, will probably adhere to the status quo, he added. Some competitor crypto exchanges might see new customers who are leaving Coinbase following these new allegations, he hypothesized – as long as these exchanges didn’t take money from “similar unsavory sources”.\n\nAs to why Epstein was so interested in crypto, and in Coinbase specifically? “Epstein might have liked Coinbase’s IPO prospects,” he surmised.\n\nCryptocurrencies’ technological capabilities may have also played a role in Epstein’s interest in the sector, said Antulio Rosales, a professor at York University who studies crypto.\n\n“There’s his possibility of seeing markets without any ethical commitments, and without any pressures of social norms and of the law itself,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Trading social media for Pokémon battles and evolutions in Kanto on a Game Boy Advance has been surprisingly serene\n\nCutting back on doomscrolling must be one of the hardest new year resolutions to keep. Instinctively tapping on the usual suspects on your phone’s home screen becomes a reflex, and vast quantities of money and user data have been specifically employed to keep you reaching for the phone, ingraining it into our work, leisure and social lives. You’ll get no shame from me if you love your phone and have a healthy relationship with your apps, but I’ve found myself struggling lately.\n\nThis year, I’m attempting to cut back on screen time – sort of. I’m replacing the sleek oblong of my smartphone with something a little more fuzzy and nostalgic. In an attempt to dismantle my bad habit, I’m closing the feeds of instant updates and instead carrying around a Game Boy Advance. I’ve been playing Pokémon FireRed, a remake of the very first Pokémon games, which turn 30 this month. Even this refreshed version is more than two decades old.\n\nImproving your digital wellbeing doesn’t necessarily mean cutting out screen time completely. Not all screens are created equal. I’m hoping that swapping one screen for another isn’t like Indiana Jones switching out the golden idol with a big bag of sand, only for the booby trap boulder to crush me all the same.\n\nI’d not played Pokémon regularly since 2006’s Pokémon Diamond on the Nintendo DS, which was my introduction to the franchise. I dabbled in Pokémon Black on the DS and Pokémon Legends: Arceus on the Nintendo Switch, but neither stuck. I’d convinced myself that once you’ve played through one Pokémon game, you’ve pretty much played them all. But as Hollywood has profitably realised, 20 years is a long enough gap for something to feel fresh again.\n\nMy first steps in Pokémon were taken in the Sinnoh region, so the prospect of visiting the Kanto region from the first games and catching the original 151 Pokémon felt exciting to me. But I couldn’t bring myself to start playing the original Red or Blue on a chunky old Game Boy. I might be trying to embrace a more analogue existence, but gaming without colour is my line in the sand.\n\nFireRed’s positive effects on my life arrived unexpectedly quickly. It only took a couple of hours of exploration and encounters with wild Pokémon to make me forget about my phone. It was sat right next to me, but it was no longer calling to me like Gollum’s ring. Usually my device would find its way into my hand during loading breaks and elaborate cutscenes on narrative-heavy and beautiful modern PlayStation games.\n\nPerhaps there’s some magic in FireRed’s more freeform approach to story and less overstimulating retro graphics. Maybe those gaps left by implied details in the design and dialogue leave space for my imagination – which my doomscrolling habit had nearly atrophied. The world of Pokémon is serene and charming, despite constant trainer battles and gruelling gym leader face-offs, and even those are quite low stakes. A gaming experience hasn’t offered me such tranquility since I first picked up Animal Crossing. Try as he might, even Tom Nook can’t patent escapism.\n\nCuriously, this adventure, though fresh for me, feels nostalgic. I’ve never played with a team solely made up of monsters from the original Pokédex, yet somehow I’m transported back to the late 90s when it seemed like the world was going Poké-mad. I even named my rival after one of my childhood best friends. All these years later, it’s so satisfying to finally, thoroughly embrace this canon.\n\nPokémon is hardly counterculture: it’s the most profitable video game franchise in history. Pokémon is gearing up for a 30th anniversary year with a McDonald’s Happy Meal promotion, a new theme park, a partnership with the Natural History Museum and a Uniqlo line among much else – so, if anything, it feels more zeitgeisty and omnipresent than it has in years. And yet it does feel rebellious to pick up an old Game Boy instead of my phone. It’s somehow unruly to take myself offline, just for a bit, to just have fun with a retro game. I’m able to enjoy technology on my own terms: I’m not coerced into microtransactions, I’m not relying on the latest oh-so essential firmware update, I’m not endlessly instructed to like, comment, \n\nFilling the natural breaks in my day with an old video game has done me the world of good, even if it’s evolving my Psyduck while dinner is in the oven or taking down a gym leader while waiting for a package. My phone’s screen time is already down by three hours a week since beginning this adventure. In a small way, it’s helping me to stop comparing myself with others and begin to tackle some existential dread that doomscrolling seems to encourage. Playing Pokémon FireRed in 2026 is utterly nourishing, and wonderfully low stakes compared to a social media ecosystem where everything is trying to appear equally urgent and meaningful.\n\nIf you’re trying to combat overthinking, insecurity or exhaustion by committing to the herculean task of using your phone less, take a quick trip to the Kanto region – or another resolutely offline game world.",

    "fullText": "Former Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United manager Harry Redknapp has called for Michael Carrick to be given the Manchester United head coach position on a permanent basis.\n\nCarrick is enjoying a fairytale start to life as caretaker boss. United brought him in during December as a temporary replacement for Ruben Amorim, who was dismissed after 14 months in charge.\n\nCarrick beat Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the role and so far, he is proving to be a shrewd acquisition. He has taken charge of four Premier League games, winning all of them.\n\nUnited have beaten Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and most recently Tottenham in that superb run. But Carrick’s impact extends well beyond the results, which currently have the Red Devils firmly within the frame to finish within the guaranteed Champions League places.\n\nAlmost overnight, he has brought in a front-foot, positive style of football that has the fans believing once more.\n\nWhile opposition defences have struggled to contain United’s aggressive approach, debate persists over whether Carrick is the right long-term choice for the club.\n\nThe likes of Roy Keane and Gary Neville have argued that United should not go for Carrick – a claim that was rubbished by Michael Owen.\n\nSpeaking after the 3-2 win over Tottenham, Rio Ferdinand explained that it is getting increasingly difficult to ignore Carrick for the role permanently.\n\nRedknapp has now weighed in, urging United to give him the job.\n\nRedknapp, who gace Carrick is senior debut at West Ham in 1999, said [as quoted by The National], “I saw him when he was a 12-year-old at West Ham.”\n\n“He used to come down from Newcastle during the school holidays.

    "fullText": "Throughout NBA history, the Los Angeles Lakers have been home to some of the most dominant scorers the game has ever seen. From the league’s earliest days to the modern era, Lakers stars have not only carried their team offensively but also set the scoring standard for the entire NBA. Leading the league in scoring while wearing purple and gold has always signaled a season of individual brilliance and historical significance.\n\n2025–26: 33.5 PPG (current pace)\n\nIn his first season wearing a Lakers uniform, Doncic immediately established himself as the league’s most dominant offensive force. His scoring lead reflects a rare blend of volume, efficiency, and creativity, as he punishes defenses at all three levels. Luka’s ability to control tempo while still producing elite numbers makes this season feel both historic and sustainable. If the pace holds, it would be one of the most impressive scoring campaigns in franchise history.\n\nKobe’s back-to-back scoring titles represent the apex of his individual offensive dominance. The 2004–05 season showcased his unmatched shot-making and willingness to shoulder the entire offensive burden. In 2005–06, he followed it up with another scoring crown, highlighted by legendary performances and relentless competitiveness. These seasons cemented Bryant as the most feared scorer of his era.\n\nShaq’s scoring title came during the lockout-shortened season, where his physical dominance was simply overwhelming. Defenses had no answer for his combination of size, power, and touch around the rim. Night after night, opponents were forced to foul or concede easy points. This season set the stage for the Lakers’ upcoming dynasty.\n\nJerry West led the league in scoring during a period defined by tough defense and limited spacing, making his numbers even more remarkable. His offensive game was built on precision, footwork, and an unshakable confidence in big moments. West carried the Lakers with consistency and poise, embodying the prototype of a complete guard. This season further solidified his legacy as one of the greatest scorers of his generation.\n\nGeorge Mikan was the NBA’s first true dominant scorer and the foundation of the Lakers’ early success. His three consecutive scoring titles came at a time when the league was still defining itself, and Mikan was clearly ahead of his peers. He forced rule changes, reshaped defensive strategies, and established the center position as the game’s focal point. These seasons made him the original face of Lakers greatness.\n\nEach Lakers player who led the NBA in scoring reflects a different era, style, and evolution of the game, yet all share the same impact: offensive supremacy. Whether through finesse, power, or relentless shot-making, these seasons stand as benchmarks of greatness within the franchise’s storied legacy. Together, they reinforce why the Lakers remain synonymous with elite scorers and unforgettable individual performances.\n\nThe post Los Angeles Lakers players who led NBA in scoring appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Alexandra Eala is in line for another boost after her performance at the Abu Dhabi Open.\n\nHer popularity was clear in Abu Dhabi, where plenty of supporters turned up just to watch her play.\n\nEala’s tennis seems to be benefiting from this, with her enjoying a breakthrough season in 2025.\n\nShe hit a ranking milestone after the Australian Open and has now improved on that again by making it to the quarterfinals in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAlthough she achieved a career-best ranking after the Australian Open, it is worth noting that Eala exited in the first round of the tournament.\n\nShe has since made back-to-back quarterfinal appearances, first at her home WTA 125 event in Manila and then at the WTA 500 tournament in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThat run in Abu Dhabi almost did not happen. Eala was down 4-0 and facing match point in the final set against Aliaksandra Sasnovich before pulling off a remarkable comeback.\n\nFollowing that win, she moved up five spots in the rankings to reach world number 40, marking another milestone.\n\nAiming to continue her progress towards that goal, Eala is set to debut at the Qatar Open. Her first-round match will be against the promising Czech teenager, Tereza Valentova.\n\nThe 20-year-old star is now just eight places shy of being seeded at Grand Slams and some of the larger WTA 1000 events.\n\nShe is not the only player making moves this week. The biggest jump belongs to Sara Bejlek, who claimed her first WTA title by defeating Ekaterina Alexandrova and has soared 63 places to world number 38.\n\nWhile she has not set a new career-best ranking, it has still been an encouraging week for Emma Raducanu.\n\nThe Briton reached her first final since winning the US Open, making it through to the title match at the WTA 250 event in Cluj-Napoca.\n\nThis time though, she fell short of the trophy, losing out to Sorana Cirstea in straight sets.\n\nEven without the title, Raducanu’s run has seen her climb five spots in the rankings. She now sits at world number 24, her highest position since August 2022.\n\nNext up for Raducanu is a first-round match against Camila Osorio at the Qatar Open, where she will look to continue her strong form.\n\nSimilar to Eala, the 23-year-old Briton will need to reduce the pressure of defending a large number of ranking points at the upcoming Miami Open before the tournament takes place next month.\n\nRoger Federer shares his all-time favorite Super Bowl memory at Seahawks vs Patriots\n\nLearner Tien’s humorous response when asked for his ‘biggest fear’",

    "description": "After watching the early running at Barcelona, McLaren CEO Zak Brown believes the same four teams will stay ahead of the pack under F1’s 2026 regulations. Formula 1 has entered a new era in 2026 with the introduction of new engine, aero, chassis and tyre rules.",
    "fullText": "After watching the early running at Barcelona, McLaren CEO Zak Brown believes the same four teams will stay ahead of the pack under F1’s 2026 regulations.\n\nFormula 1 has entered a new era in 2026 with the introduction of new engine, aero, chassis and tyre rules. The 2026 F1 regulations mark the biggest regulatory overhaul in history, due largely to the new engines with a near 50/50 split between electric and combustion power.\n\nThe sweeping changes led some to wonder if they might shake up the competitive order, but after early testing in Barcelona, it seems little has changed at the front. McLaren still look like Mercedes’ main challenger for now.\n\nMercedes were already expected by many to lead under these regulations, especially with their history of excelling during rule changes. There are even suggestions they may have exploited a grey area within F1’s new power unit guidelines.\n\nThere were questions around Red Bull heading into the 2026 season, with the team taking on engine manufacturing for the first time. It was Christian Horner who set up Red Bull Powertrains when Honda signalled their exit from Formula 1.\n\nDespite early doubts about how reliable that first RBPT DM01 unit would be, built in collaboration with Ford, McLaren CEO Zak Brown came away from Barcelona “impressed” by how solid it looked right out of the box. Brown even admitted he’d prefer if it wasn’t as competitive as it appeared.\n\n“It kind of looks like the usual suspects, but it is hard to tell in what order,” said Brown, speaking via RacingNews365. “The Red Bull engine was very strong.\n\n“I think everyone was pleasantly surprised. I’d rather them not be as competitive, but I’m impressed with what they’ve done because they came out, they did a lot of miles and they seem to be very competitive.”\n\nRed Bull are still working on the drivability of their 2026 F1 rules engine following the test in Barcelona, where reliability was the top concern for every team. But the early signs suggest Red Bull will be among the front-running teams with McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari again.\n\nThe quartet were the class of the field during the 2025 F1 season, with McLaren securing 34 podiums, Red Bull taking 15, Mercedes reaching 12 and Ferrari getting seven from a possible 72. The remaining four rostrums went the way of Williams (2), Sauber and Racing Bulls (1).\n\nMcLaren (14), Red Bull (8) and Mercedes (2) even accounted for all 24 Grand Prix wins in the final year of F1’s latest ground-effect era. Also, McLaren won the 2025 F1 constructors’ title at the Singapore Grand Prix with six rounds to spare, to match Red Bull’s record set in 2023.\n\nThe Woking natives ultimately finished last year with a 364-point lead over Mercedes in the constructors’ standings, as Lando Norris also won the F1 drivers’ championship for the first time. Red Bull and Ferrari were third and fourth with 382 and 435-point deficits to McLaren.\n\nFerrari hope to catch F1 rivals off guard with surprise upgrade on Lewis Hamilton’s 2026 car\n\nOscar Piastri tipped as the ideal replacement for one driver if he leaves McLaren in 2027\n\nKim Kardashian and Lewis Hamilton seemingly go public as a couple at Super Bowl LX",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOne of the most well-known athletes at the 2026 Winter Olympics is a ski star competing for China.\n\nEileen Gu, though, wasn't born in China. She was born in the United States. It draws extra attention to her moves on the slopes, including during Monday's slopestyle competition.\n\nHer worldwide popularity due to her early fame and social media stardom only shines an additional light on her every move.\n\nGu got her Olympics competition underway Saturday in Italy when she finished second in the qualifying round of the women's slopestyle competition.\n\nShe'll have plenty more time in the spotlight before these Olympics are through.\n\nMORE: Amber Glenn has the most surprising interest at the Olympics\n\nGu made her decision to compete for China when she was 15 years old in 2022, and she did it for representation reasons.\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu has said in the past about popularity of women's skiiers in the United States. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nAdding a bit to the controversy was that Gu had already competed for Team USA during three slopestyle World Cup events before she made the switch.\n\nShe wrote at the time that it was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love.\"\n\nMORE: Breezy Johnson won a gold medal for the U.S., and then she broke it\n\nGu then captured all the headlines while landing a double cork 1620 in the big air competition to claim the gold medal.\n\n“My whole thing was, it’s all upside,” recalls Gu. “Because if I land, I will win the Olympics.

    "fullText": "The 2026 NBA Three-Point Contest brings together a compelling mix of proven champions, first-time participants, and rising shooters who reflect how central the long ball has become in today’s game. From seasoned All-Stars with past hardware to young players eager to announce themselves on a national stage, this field is stacked with both credibility and intrigue. Each competitor enters with a distinct shooting profile, ensuring a contest defined by contrasting styles, streaks, and momentum swings.\n\nDevin Booker returns to the Three-Point Contest as one of the more experienced shooters in the field, bringing back memorable performances from past All-Star Weekends. Although his current 3-point percentage this season is a career low, his pedigree and confidence with the deep ball keep him a threat on the racks. Booker won this event in 2018 and has made multiple appearances, which gives him both historical relevance and fan appeal. Expect him to lean on his rhythm and composure when the clock starts.\n\nRookie Kon Knueppel has quickly established himself as one of the league’s rising long-range threats with an excellent percentage this season. His inclusion in the contest marks a rare opportunity for a first-year player to compete for the title, and he’ll aim to become the first rookie ever to win. Knueppel’s high volume and efficient shooting make him a serious contender right out of the gate. His youth and fearless shooting style will be fun to watch as he battles veterans.\n\nDespite missing the entire NBA season with a torn Achilles, Damian Lillard will still suit up for the 3-Point Contest, a testament to his elite reputation as a marksman. Lillard is a two-time winner of this event and can tie the all-time record with his third title. His career 3-point scoring and clutch gene make him a perennial fan favorite, regardless of in-season play. Lillard’s participation adds a compelling storyline of resilience and competitive pride.\n\nTyrese Maxey enters the contest riding a breakout season as one of the NBA’s most dynamic scorers, combining pace with deep shooting prowess. This will be his first appearance in the Three-Point Contest, aligning with his first All-Star starter nod. Maxey’s ability to make tough catch-and-shoot attempts under pressure gives him a versatile edge on the racks. His confidence from downtown blends well with his overall offensive game, making him a dark-horse candidate.\n\nDonovan Mitchell is another All-Star entering the contest with a reputation for confident and flashy deep shooting. As the Cavaliers’ lead scorer, Mitchell blends volume with creativity, often pulling up from range in rhythm. His presence adds star power and competitive intensity to the field, especially when the spotlight gets bright. Expect Mitchell to attack the money balls with the same aggression he brings in late-game situations.\n\nJamal Murray brings his sharpshooting pedigree from both the regular season and playoff stages to the Three-Point Contest. Known for his calm demeanor and clutch threes, Murray complements Stephen Curry’s shooting leadership in Denver’s offense. This appearance aligns with his first All-Star selection, showcasing his ascent among the league’s premier perimeter scorers. Given his range and confidence, he can heat up quickly when the rack lights turn on.\n\nVeteran forward Bobby Portis Jr. earned his first 3-Point Contest nod thanks to a breakout shooting season, boasting one of the highest percentages among contestants. His stride into elite floor spacing has helped Milwaukee’s offense evolve, making him more than a traditional big man. Portis’ smooth release and catch-and-shoot rhythm make him a legitimate threat in this format. His inclusion underscores how modern bigs can impact spacing and contest formats alike.\n\nNorman Powell enters the event as an All-Star and one of Miami’s most reliable 3-point shooters this season. His shooting profile blends athleticism with catch-and-shoot efficiency, and he has experience from prior contests as well. Powell’s ability to get hot in spurts could make him dangerous in the rapid-fire rhythm of the 3-Point Contest. As a player who thrives in momentum, he’ll look to heat up early and carry it through the rounds.\n\nWhen the final rack is emptied on Saturday, February 14 at 5:00 p.m. ET, the 2026 Three‑Point Contest is sure to hinge on rhythm, confidence, and a competitor’s ability to perform under the clock. With this blend of elite scorers, specialists, and fearless newcomers all taking aim at the same moment, the difference between victory and elimination could be a single swish or miss. No matter who hoists the title at the State Farm 3‑Point Contest, this field underscores how deep shooting continues to define the modern NBA and why this event remains one of All‑Star Weekend’s most anticipated traditions.\n\nThe post NBA 2026 Three-point contest participants appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 NFL season has concluded with Super Bowl LX, and now the focus shifts to the 2026 offseason. For the Chicago Bears, they'll be looking to shore up the roster for head coach Ben Johnson in free agency and the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Bears have some important roster moves to make this offseason, including with some in-house free agents -- whether that's re-signing some or filling holes left by departing players. Chicago has 27 players scheduled to become free agents in 2026 according to Over The Cap, including some key starters and contributors.\n\nThere are some players who could very well sign a contract extension, including safeties Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker, as well as cornerback Nahshon Wright and linebacker D'Marco Jackson, who all had big seasons with the Bears. But there are some big decisions to be made by general manager Ryan Poles about those players and the rest of the group of pending free agents.\n\nHere's a look at the Bears players set to hit the open market in free agency:\n\nThe 2026 free agency negotiation window begins March 9, where teams can negotiate with available players. The free agency period officially opens two days later on March 11.\n\nThe Bears are projected to be $5.3 million over the salary cap for the 2026 season, which is the 12th worst in the league. But Chicago will make some moves in regards to contract restructures and perhaps parting ways with some expensive veterans to free up cap space to make some moves this offseason.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears pending free agents: Who's slated to hit the market in 2026",

    "fullText": "After a win on Sunday, LSU women's basketball is holding firm in the top five of the NCAA's latest NET rankings, a key factor the NCAA selection committee looks at when seeding teams in March.\n\nLSU is sitting just behind two SEC rivals, with South Carolina ranking No. 3 and Texas sitting at No. 4. LSU is 22-3 on the year and 4-3 in games vs. quad one opponents, meaning all of their losses have been to Q1 teams. LSU is 3-0 vs. quad two opponents and 3-0 vs. quad three opponents.\n\nLSU beat Auburn 77-44 on Sunday, bouncing back after the Tigers fell at Texas last week. Freshman ZaKiyah Johnson led the way for LSU with 16 points. MiKaylah Williams also scored in double-digits.\n\nLSU's net ranking indicates the Tigers are still in play for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. March is approaching, but the Tigers still have several chances to build their resume while already having a few signature wins under their belt.\n\nLSU's next game is a big one as the Tigers will host South Carolina in Baton Rouge on Saturday. LSU has all week to prepare as they search for an elusive victory over Dawn Staley's Gamecocks.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Where LSU women's basketball stands in updated NET rankings",

    "fullText": "The Sporting News national high school girls basketball top 25 rankings (Feb. 9) originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's finally high school basketball postseason time in a small but hardy handful of high-powered states and federations. And despite Bullis' ESPN-televised upset of Long Island Lutheran, the rankings have more or less stabilized – for now.\n\nHere are The Sporting News national high school girls basketball rankings for the week of Feb. 9.\n\nPREVIOUS RANKINGS: Preseason | Dec. 1 | Dec. 8 | Dec. 15 | Dec. 22 | Dec. 29 | Jan. 5 | Jan. 12 | Jan. 19 | Jan. 26 | Feb. 2\n\nAfter winning a disputed national title last season, Bishop McNamara is drawing nearer to a second consecutive national title – perhaps an undisputed one – with every week in which it wins out. Last week, the Mustangs pulled through in overtime against Elizabeth Seton for the second time this season and then beat St. John's by a 14-point margin. Only TAHC, St. Mary's Ryken, and Bishop Ireton remain on their regular season schedule, and Bishop Ireton also took the Mustangs to overtime earlier this season.\n\nThe Knights beat Rancho Christian 85-65 in a tuneup game to end the regular season. Ontario Christian is the No. 1 seed in the CIF-Southern Section Open Division playoffs as expected and shares a pool with Rancho Christian and JSerra – two teams it's already beaten by 20 points this season.\n\nMercifully, the Cavaliers' regular season is down to its last week after a 70-37 rout of Green Run and 88-13 demolition of Ocean Lakes. Princess Anne's 70-57 win over Bullis looks even better now after Bullis upset Long Island Lutheran.\n\nThe Monarchs cruised past St. Ignatius 66-22 in their only game of the week.\n\nLong Island Lutheran's upset loss to Bullis doesn't help the Trailblazers' stock in a vacuum due to their loss against Long Island Lutheran, but the Trailblazers actually move up a spot without any teams having a strong argument to leap them. Like Ontario Christian, Sierra Canyon enters CIF-SS Open Division pool play tasked with beating two teams it's already beaten – Oak Park and Corona Centennial, the latter of which played the Trailblazers to a 62-55 finish.\n\nThe winning streak is up to 11 games, and all except for the win over Long Island Lutheran have been blowouts.\n\nIt's no surprise to see Bullis breaking through for a high-ranking victory, and the blow is cushioned by the fact that LuHi is still 1-1 this season against Bullis. But it's definitely concerning to see the Crusaders fall 75-72 to a team they previously beat 70-49.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Etiwanda didn't lose another game for the rest of the regular season after frontcourt stars Jaylee Moore and Tess Oldenburg became eligible on Dec. 26 following the CIF's transfer sit-out period. The two-time reigning national champions and three-time reigning Open Division state champions crack the top eight for the first time this season and have a serious shot to continue to their dynastic postseason success across the Southern Section and/or state playoffs. Etiwanda will face Fairmont Prep and Saint Joseph (Lakewood) in CIF-SS pool play after beating Saint Joseph 72-44 in January.\n\nThe Dragons made a statement with a 65-38 rout of West Des Moines Valley to nearly clinch a third consecutive undefeated regular season.\n\nThe Moose' regular season is complete and they will play for an FSL title this week.\n\nIt's unclear what the rest of SPIRE's season looks like, but we can probably all agree that it would be fun to see them in a national postseason setting.\n\nSt. James stayed sharp with a 77-52 rout of St. Frances Academy.\n\nA bye week came immediately after DME Academy's only week of the season. DME has the resume to bounce back up in the rankings if the opportunities arise with its only loss coming to The St. James Performance Academy.\n\nThe Lancers blew out St. Rose, Red Bank Regional, and Thrive Carter to keep the winning streak going.\n\nRed Bank Catholic's defense was stifling as the Caseys pulled out a win in their lowest-scoring game of the season, a 41-33 victory over formidable Cardinal O'Hara.\n\nDespite a 14-point loss to top-ranked Bishop McNamara, St. John's moved up four spots thanks to its prior win over Bullis, which just beat Long Island Lutheran. The Cadets also won by 20 points last week against an Elizabeth Seton team that pushed them to overtime earlier this season and has now done so twice against Bishop McNamara too.\n\nIvanna Wilson-Manyacka went off for 26 points and 15 rebounds as Bullis toppled Long Island Lutheran on ESPN. For now, the Bulldogs rise four spots for the win over Long Island Lutheran, which dropped three. If that win didn't \"only\" move them to 1-1 on the season against LuHi, it might've vaulted them a bit higher despite their loss to St. John's. But Bullis' current winning streak could definitely continue to move the needle in the rankings as Bullis' season winds on. And avenging a 21-point loss to an elite team is an excellent sign and accomplishment.\n\nLPA only scored half as many points against Kingdom Collegiate Academy as it did when it beat KCA 88-72 in January, losing 53-44 in its only game of the week.\n\nThe Timberwolves passed a key test on Tuesday by beating West Linn 61-52.\n\nOne more game and the undefeated regular season is official. Will anybody beat Westlake at all this season?\n\nThe blurb for Westlake can be copy/pasted for Texas' other undefeated large school powerhouse. With Westlake in UIL Division 6A and Wagner in 5A, both could go undefeated through state titles – although both will have to outlast deep playoff fields of serious unranked competition to do so.\n\nThe Tigers look to beat Wayne Memorial, which is otherwise unbeaten, for the second time this season on Tuesday. Belleville won 77-49 when they played on Jan. 16.\n\nHoover finished the regular season in strong fashion, putting on for Alabama as usual in a 75-51 win over perennial Georgia stalwart Holy Innocents' Episcopal. At this point, the Buccaneers are a heavy favorite to otherwise win out after getting upset in their season debut.\n\nIt's a juicy CIF-SS Open Division pool play pairing for Sage Hill, which got placed in a bracket with Redondo Union and Mater Dei. Sage Hill has given Mater Dei a run for its money a handful of times in recent memory but hasn't broken through, and this will be its best chance yet.\n\nWith four games left in the regular season, Wauwatosa East is in the clear having previously blown out every team remaining on its schedule. The Red Raiders and Arrowhead are both in WIAA Division 1, so a playoff rematch is incoming if both teams remain unbeaten against all other challengers.\n\nDemocracy Prep Agassi Campus (NV)\n\nSN's national high school girls basketball top 25 rankings (Feb. 2)\n\nComplete guide to boys and girls basketball playoffs, state championship start dates\n\nMcDonald's All-American Game 2026: Complete rosters, college recruitments, commitments\n\nTexas signee, former Mamba Academy star drops 64 points on senior night\n\nBoys basketball: No. 1 SPIRE Academy loses 66-52 to No. 14 Montverde Academy",

    "fullText": "The 2025 season is complete after a thrilling Super Bowl. Now the work begins for all 32 teams to retool their roster and prepare for a potential playoff appearance next season. After an offensive coordinator and passing game coordinator change, the Eagles' roster will likely undergo further changes. The Birds have 21 players who'll test the restricted or unrestricted free-agent market during the 2026 NFL offseason. Several key factors include a pending contract extension for Jalen Carter and the contract status for star tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nReed Blankenship is one of the biggest names on the list, and the defense could look drastically different with Nakobe Dean entering the final year of his rookie deal.\n\nWith the off-season officially underway in Philadelphia, we're looking at nine players who seem likely to depart.\n\nThe 27-year-old Uche played in 12 games and recorded 1 sack.\n\nOjulari saw action in three games before spending the bulk of the season on IR.\n\nThe 2022 sixth-round pick just finished his fourth season in the NFL, and likely played his last game in Philadelphia. A Former college teammate of Jalen Hurts at Oklahoma, eaching the end of his rookie contract. Calcaterra played in 62 games with 22 starts.\n\nA former Commanders first-round pick, Dotson spent two unproductive seasons with the Eagles, playing in 34 games and recording 37 catches on 69 targets for 478 yards and one regular-season touchdown.\n\nA versatile and solid lineman, the 29-year-old played 363 snaps at center and guard, allowing two sacks.\n\nThe Eagles acquired Howell via trade in August, making him the third-string quarterback. He didn't play a single game with the Eagles this season, but could certainly return.\n\nOkoronkwo played in just one game this season and landed on IR.\n\nDillon signed a one-year deal with Philadelphia after missing last season with a neck injury, but things didn't work out. The veteran running back lost his role when the Eagles brought in Tank Bigsby via trade. Dillon, 27, ended up with just 12 rushing attempts for 60 yards this season.\n\nThe Eagles signed Epps to their practice squad at the start of the season and eventually promoted him to the active roster. When rookie Drew Mukuba fractured his ankle, Epps regained his starting role at safety next to Blankenship.\n\nThe 30-year-old veteran signed a one-year deal with the Eagles in the offseason and improved for Vic Fangio as the season went on, outplaying Kelee Ringo and Jakorian Bennett.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 9 Eagles players who seem likely to depart",

    "fullText": "With the summer window approaching, Chelsea are expected to be active again under Todd Boehly and Clearlake, who spent nearly £300m last summer.\n\nDespite the heavy spending, they balanced it with significant sales. Noni Madueke went to Arsenal for over £50m and Christopher Nkunku made the move to Milan.\n\nThere are clear areas where Chelsea are looking to strengthen this time around. They need a new goalkeeper, have shown interest in defensive reinforcements, and cover in midfield is also on the list. Emmanuel Emegha has been brought in to add depth up front.\n\nJamie Gittens and Alejandro Garnacho have not found their feet at Stamford Bridge yet. If Geovany Quenda is not considered ready, the club may look for another winger. All signs point towards more changes ahead.\n\nAmong Chelsea’s current choices, Benoit Badiashile has slipped down the order, even before Levi Colwill returns to full fitness or Mamadou Sarr and Aaron Anselmino get their opportunities in the starting XI.\n\nRight now, Badiashile looks to be behind Wesley Fofana, Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo in Rosenior’s plans. By the time the summer arrives, there’s a good chance he’ll be looking for a new club.\n\nCaught Offside have noted that with Colwill, Sarr, Anselmino and potential new arrivals all competing for places, the £35m centre-back is likely to struggle for any meaningful game time if he stays at Stamford Bridge next season.\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, AC Milan are interested in adding another Chelsea player to a list that already includes Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Nkunku, Christian Pulisic and Fikayo Tomori. And they are not the only ones keeping an eye on him.\n\nThe report also suggests that Juventus might consider a summer move if he becomes available. Meanwhile, there is even talk of Roberto De Zerbi looking to bring the former Monaco defender back to France.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that breaking into the first team will be a challenge for him. Rosenior has already shown a preference for Chalobah and Fofana as his main centre-backs, and Colwill has not even returned yet.\n\nBadiashile needs to recognise the situation he is in – there are too many players ahead of him, and staying put would likely mean limited minutes. A summer move looks like the best option if he wants regular football at this stage of his career.\n\nWhy Madonna attended Tottenham vs Chelsea in the Women’s Super League\n\nAlejandro Garnacho unhappy with £25m Chelsea teammate even as Wolves seal victory",

    "fullText": "Who: Boston College Eagles (15-9-1) vs boston university terriers (13-13-2)\n\nHow to Watch: The matchup will be live on NESN.\n\nIt hasn’t been that long since the Eagles met the terriers; the Eagles came away with the 4-1 win at Agganis a week and some ago, and Louka Cloutier & Dean Letourneau were named second and first stars of the night respectively.\n\nCole Hutson still leads the terriers with 25 points, followed by Cole Eiserman who has 17.\n\nIn net, Yegorov has a .902 save percentage.\n\nThe terriers won against Northeastern in a shootout last Monday night to punch their ticket to the championship game. They beat Maine in OT on Friday in their in-between game.\n\nHonestly, I don’t know. The Eagles simply laid an egg on Friday night against Vermont, getting blown out on home ice 6-1 and taking a big hit to their NPI.\n\nThe team was clearly distracted, and no one had a good game. There’s not really much to take away from it or much more I can say. It was a lackluster, uninspiring effort for a game that required them to stay focused and needed to end with them feeling confident. This is when you hope someone is able to rally the group with a short turnaround and remind them what they’re capable of – whether that’s the coaches or the captains or an unsung leader without a letter.\n\nThere’s a lot of noise surrounding the Eagles after their performance against Vermont, despite their strong showing against Harvard – they’re going to have to completely block it out and get back on track.",

    "fullText": "Klint Kubiak addressed his future within minutes of the Seattle Seahawks winning Super Bowl LX, offering clarity that quickly shifted attention away from the celebration.\n\nThe offensive coordinator spoke candidly on the field, acknowledging both the magnitude of the moment and what comes next in his coaching career.\n\nSpeaking to NFL Network moments after the final whistle, Klint Kubiak reflected on the win while hinting at an imminent transition.\n\n“Yeah! That’s up to God, and we’re just gonna we’re gonna enjoy tonight. You guys know I’m going to Las Vegas. I’m fired up about it. But tonight, for one more night,” the Seahawks OC said.\n\nThe comments immediately drew attention because they acknowledged what had already been widely expected. Kubiak is set to become the new head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, bringing his Super Bowl-winning credibility with him.\n\nRather than deflecting the question, Kubiak leaned into the reality of the situation. He made it clear that while his focus remained on celebrating with the Seahawks, his next chapter was already in motion.\n\nThe conversation turned more direct as Kubiak was pressed further on his future, with the coach offering unmistakable confirmation of his next step.\n\n“Hell yeah, I’m going, of course. I’m going. Yeah, just confirmed it right here,” Kubiak added.\n\nThe remarks removed any remaining doubt about his departure from Seattle. After helping guide the Seahawks to a Super Bowl title, Kubiak is now preparing to take over a Raiders franchise looking for stability and identity.\n\nThe Raiders are handing him the keys at a time when the team is searching for long-term direction, while Kubiak arrives with momentum built from championship success.\n\nFor Seattle, the timing is bittersweet. The Seahawks secured Super Bowl glory, but the victory also marked the end of Kubiak’s tenure with the organization.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence’s immediate ‘not in labor’ question after winning Super Bowl LX is going viral\n\nKenneth Walker III wins Super Bowl MVP despite Jason Myers setting record\n\nDrake Curse strikes New England Patriots as rapper loses $1 million in Super Bowl bet",

Now there's, in her words, \"a high likelihood that I'm going to cross the finish line and I'll just have half an eyebrow.\"\n\nMIKAELA SHIFFRIN ⛷💨 (@mikaelashiffrin) • Instagram reel6,209 likes, 159 comments - mikaelashiffrin on February 9, 2026: \"IYKYK…and now you know🫣🤷‍♀️🤪😅OOPSIE\".\n\nShiffrin's split-second decision-making on the slopes has helped make her one of the greatest skiers in history. But her spontaneous decision to shave part of her eyebrow may not have been one of her best.\n\nDespite that little setback, Shiffrin will begin her quest for gold in three events at the Milano Cortina Games starting Tuesday in the women's team combined.\n\nHere's a look at when Shiffrin is competing at the 2026 Winter Olympics:\n\nFeb. 10: Women's team combined (slalom) | 8 a.m. ET\n\nFeb. 15: Women's giant slalom run 1 | 4 a.m. ET\n\nFeb. 15: Women's giant slalom run 2 | 7:30 a.m. ET\n\nFeb. 18: Women's slalom run 1 | 4 a.m. ET\n\nFeb. 18: Women's slalom run 2 | 7:30 a.m. ET\n\nHere's how to watch Shiffrin at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy:\n\nEach Olympic event can be viewed live with Peacock, NBC's exclusive streaming service, or NBCOlympics.com.

Lebron was one of 55 total players named to the preseason watch list.\n\nA returning starter, Lebron will more than likely play a crucial role in the Tide’s lineup throughout the 2026 season. The talented shortstop was nothing short of elite in 2025, as Lebron was credited with 18 home runs while batting an impressive .316 on the year. Lebron recorded 72 RBI in 2025 as well, as the star shortstop will look to pick up right where he left off.\n\nLebron started all 59 games for the Tide last season. The shortstop was named as a Golden Spikes Award semifinalist during his sophomore campaign, as Lebron was widely regarded as one of the top shortstops in all of college baseball in 2025.\n\nLebron and the Tide will begin the season on Feb. 13 against Washington State, as Alabama will look to start the 2026 campaign with a series win over the Cougars.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama's Justin Lebron named to Golden Spikes preseason watch list",

If you don’t know about Thompson, know this: he was the player Michael Jordan aspired to be.\n\nState is the more fierce of the two teams lately and that counts for a lot, but Louisville has a major size advantage.\n\nMikel Brown is back, but he hasn’t been the same since his back started giving him problems: in the four games since he got back, Brown has shot 63.3%, 7.7%, 50%, 14.3% and 20%. This from a projected lottery pick. It just sort of shows you how fine the edge is for high-level athletes. He’ll be fine eventually, but right now? He’s struggling.\n\nState is more organized right now. It’s a smallish team but athletic and mobile. A lot may ride on how well Ven-Allen Lubin does. And in his last three games, Quadir Copeland has 36 assists and 5 turnovers, which is unbelievable.\n\nThere are a lot of factors to State’s recent success, but Copeland and Lubin have been really good during that streak.\n\nThe Pack gets UNC at home next Tuesday and for the first time in forever, that’s a must-watch game.\n\nSpeaking of UNC, following Saturday’s court storming, the ACC fined Carolina $50,000 as required.

Brooklyn made some moves prior to last week's trade deadline and with the Chicago Bulls (24-29) coming to town, the Nets may get to see two of their trade acquisitions get some playing time. If you're wondering how you can watch all the action live, you've come to the right place!\n\nThe Nets come into this game following a 127-113 win over the Washington Wizards on Saturday in which Brooklyn raced out to a 26-point lead to end the first quarter and never looked back. Forward Michael Porter Jr. led the way for the Nets with his 23 points and six rebounds while center Day'Ron Sharpe had one of his best games of the season as he dropped 19 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench.\n\nThe Bulls enter this matchup after a 136-120 loss to the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in which Chicago stayed within striking distance until the fourth quarter where Denver blew the game open by way of an 39-16 rally in the final period. Forward Matas Buzelis led the team in scoring with 21 points while also chipping in eight rebounds and guard Collin Sexton had 17 points and four assists in 29 minutes off the bench.\n\nHere is what you need to know to get ready for this matchup:\n\nLocation: Barclays Center, Brooklyn, NY\n\nNets: OUT: Egor Demin (rest), Michael Porter Jr. (knee), Tyson Etienne (G League), Chaney Johnson (G League), and EJ Liddell (G League).\n\nBulls: OUT: Zach Collins (toe), Noa Essengue (shoulder), Yuki Kawamura (G League), and Mac McClung (G League).

    "description": "The highest-leverage longevity habits (20% effort for 80% impact) — nutrition, exercise, sleep, supplements, and sauna protocols from evidence-based experts.",
    "fullText": "A guide to the highest-leverage longevity habits (20% effort for 80% impact) compiled from evidence-based clinicians and coaches. Curated from Andrew Huberman, David Sinclair, Layne Norton, Andy Galpin, Rhonda Patrick, Bryan Johnson, and others.\n\nDisclaimer: This guide is for informational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a qualified healthcare provider before making changes to your diet, exercise, or supplement routine — especially if you have existing health conditions or take medication.\n\nBase your diet on whole or minimally processed foods (meat/fish/eggs or plant proteins, vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, nuts, olive oil) and dramatically reduce ultra-processed foods. [1] [2] [3]\n\nPrioritize protein + fiber so you stay full and support muscle: each meal should include a clear protein source and high-fiber plants (vegetables/beans/fruit/whole grains). [1] [2] [3]\n\nLimit the “big 3” that make diets go off the rails: liquid calories, added sugars, and highly processed snacks/meals, because they make overeating easy. [1] [2] [3]\n\nProtein intake supports muscle growth and maintenance, aids weight management by promoting satiety, strengthens bones and immunity, regulates hormones and blood sugar, and enhances overall recovery and metabolic health. [1] [2]\n\nAim for 1.2 to 1.6 g protein per kg bodyweight per day (Example: 70 kg -> 85 to 110 g/day). [1] [2]\n\nIf you lift weights, diet (cut), or want muscle go higher: 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg/day. [1] [2] [3]\n\nTip: Spread your protein intake across multiple meals throughout the day for better absorption.\n\nFiber intake, a non-digestible carbohydrate from plant foods available as soluble and insoluble types, promotes digestive regularity, lowers cholesterol and blood sugar levels, supports weight control through satiety, boosts gut microbiome health, strengthens heart protection, and reduces risks of diabetes, cancer, and inflammation. [1]\n\nAim for 25 to 35 g/day as a simple baseline. [1] [2] [3]\n\nIf you want a more “optimized” target, build toward 30 to 60 g/day (increase slowly). [1]\n\nThe easiest way to hit it: make 2 meals/day include a clear fiber source (vegetables + beans/lentils + fruit and/or whole grains). [1]\n\nTip: increase fiber gradually over 1 to 2 weeks to avoid bloating and drink more water.\n\nSugar intake, particularly added sugars and refined forms like fructose in processed foods and drinks, is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, heart disease through inflammation and high triglycerides, fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and depression, dental decay, gout, and increased cancer risks. [1]\n\nDefault: minimize added sugar (especially sugary drinks + corn syrup); get sweetness mainly from whole fruit. [1] [2]\n\nA simple “OK” cap: keep added sugar within conservative public-health limits, e.g. ≤25 g/day (women) or ≤36 g/day (men), and ideally ≤10% of calories. [1]\n\nLongevity-leaning approach: many people in this camp try to avoid refined/added sugars most of the time. [1] [2] [3]\n\nCoffee consumption, primarily through its caffeine and antioxidant content in moderate amounts (3-4 cups daily), enhances cognitive alertness and performance, is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and certain cancers like liver and prostate, supports liver and kidney health, lowers all-cause mortality, and provides anti-inflammatory metabolic benefits. [1] [2]\n\nProper hydration regulates temperature, supports cognitive function and mood, aids digestion and waste removal, enhances physical performance and joint lubrication, prevents headaches and fatigue, and promotes heart health and kidney function. [1]\n\nUse a simple baseline: drink to thirst, and make urine pale yellow most of the day (not crystal clear all day, not dark). Usually it is 30 to 35 mL per kg/day. [1] [2]\n\nDistribute this throughout the day — don't chug it all at once. Stop earlier to avoid waking at night.\n\nAlcohol consumption, even in moderation but especially when excessive, damages the liver leading to cirrhosis and cancer, weakens the heart causing high blood pressure, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy, impairs brain function resulting in cognitive decline, memory loss, and addiction, increases risks of multiple cancers (mouth, throat, breast, liver), disrupts immunity and sleep, promotes mental health issues like depression and anxiety, and accelerates overall mortality. [1] [2]\n\nBest-for-health default: the less the better, with zero being the safest baseline for brain and long-term health. [1] [2]\n\nIf you choose to drink anyway: no more than 2 drinks per week. [1] [2]\n\nFish oil, rich in omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, provides key health benefits including improved heart function, better brain and mental health, eye and skin support, and reduced joint inflammation. [1] [2]\n\nDefault: get omega-3s from fatty fish ~2x/week, or supplement if you do not eat fish. [1]\n\nIf supplementing: use a product where the label shows EPA + DHA, and aim around ~1 to 3 g/day EPA+DHA (many people land near ~2 g/day). [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nSafety note: if you have AFib history, bleeding risk, or take blood thinners, be cautious with higher doses. [1]\n\nCreatine supports rapid energy production in muscles, which can improve strength, power, high-intensity exercise performance, and muscle mass, while also enhancing brain function like memory and cognition. [1] [2]\n\nTake creatine monohydrate 5 g/day, consistently (timing is not important). [1] [2] [3]\n\nFor brain support under stress consider 10 g/day (split 5 g + 5 g) for ~6 to 8 weeks; this is often discussed for cognitive benefits, especially when sleep-deprived or “stressed brain” contexts. [1] [2]\n\nSome research discussed uses ~20 to 30 g once (for example 0.35 g/kg once) to blunt sleep-deprivation hits to cognition. [1]\n\nZone 2 cardio, a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (roughly 60-70% of max heart rate), enhances fat burning, mitochondrial efficiency, endurance, cardiovascular health, and recovery while reducing chronic disease risk. [1] [2]\n\nUse an easy intensity check: Zone 2 should feel like you can talk in sentences but not sing (steady, sustainable). [1] [2]\n\nAim for 150 to 200 minutes/week of Zone 2 (for example 3 to 4 sessions of 45 to 60 min). [1] [2]\n\nStrength training, involving resistance exercises like weights or bodyweight movements, builds muscle strength, boosts metabolism, enhances bone density, reduces injury risk, and improves overall longevity and mental well-being. [1]\n\nDo strength training 2 to 3 days/week as a strong baseline for healthspan (and to maintain/build muscle as you age). [1] [2]\n\nProgression rule of thumb (Galpin): increase gradually, roughly ~3%/week intensity and ~5%/week volume (do not crank volume up endlessly; keep weekly jumps modest). [1]\n\nDeload cadence: build for about ~6 weeks, then take a deload week before building again (50% fewer sets and/or using 10% to 20% lighter weights). [1] [2]\n\nSleep is a vital restorative process that enhances cognitive function, boosts immune defenses, supports heart health and metabolism, aids muscle recovery, and improves mood and emotional regulation. [1] [2]\n\nKeep a consistent sleep and wake time (within ~30 to 60 minutes every day) and aim for ~7 to 9 hours (Sinclair often mentions 7 to 8). [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nGet morning outdoor light during first hour after waking (roughly 10 to 30 minutes, more if cloudy) to anchor your body clock and improve nighttime sleep. [1] [2]\n\nCut caffeine at least 8 to 10 hours before bed. [1]\n\nMake the bedroom cool and dark (cool room helps deeper sleep). [1] [2]\n\nReduce bright light/screens in the last 1 to 2 hours before bed (dim lights, warm lighting). [1] [2]\n\nOptional supplements (only if needed): low-dose melatonin and/or magnesium, glycine, L-theanine are commonly discussed as “try if you struggle” tools. [1] [2]\n\nSauna bathing, involving exposure to dry heat, mimics moderate exercise through heat stress, is associated with cardiovascular improvements, reduced inflammation, enhanced recovery, better mental health, and longevity benefits. [1] [2]\n\nSimple “works for most” protocol: 80 to 100°C (176 to 212°F) for 5 to 20 min, 2 to 3x/week (more frequent can be better if you tolerate it). [1]\n\nIf you want the “max benefit” version many people reference: 4 to 7x/week is the high-frequency range most associated with big health correlations in Finnish sauna studies (observational). [1] [2]\n\nTraining/recovery timing note: heat after training can be used for recovery, but it’s not magic; apply it as a tool, not a replacement for sleep/nutrition (and be mindful of dehydration).

    "description": "Andrew Athias said his job at the halftime show was really easy: \"Don't move. Stand here and be one with the grass.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Athias, 33, a Philadelphia-based digital marketer and content creator. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was one of the 500 bunches of dancing grass at Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show. I got paid $18.70 per hour for the gig, but I would've done it for free.\n\nI'm a big Bad Bunny fan. I've been to three of his concerts since my girlfriend introduced me to him in 2021.\n\nI found the grass gig through a company called Backlit, which handles finding extras for the halftime show. I found it last year when I saw Kendrick Lamar at the Super Bowl halftime show, but I forgot about it until Bad Bunny was announced as Super Bowl's headliner in October, and I decided to apply.\n\nI was one of the few crazy people to fly over from the East Coast to be part of the field cast. I flew out to San Francisco from Philadelphia in the middle of a snowstorm and have been out here for two weeks, rehearsing for the big day, and it has been worth it.\n\nThe requirements for the role were pretty basic. You had to be no taller than six feet, no shorter than five feet seven inches, and of an athletic build.\n\nThe listing said we had to be able to wear a 40-plus-pound costume and to be comfortable dancing in proximity with other performers for long periods. Other than that, we had to measure every part of our body from head to toe, elbow to floor, shoulder to clavicle, etc. Those were the only requirements.\n\nThey didn't tell us we'd be wearing a grass costume and kept it super vague.\n\nMy part was actually really easy. They just told me where to stand, and they said, \"Don't move. Stand here and be one with the grass.\"\n\nThe suits were heavy and uncomfortable. Every now and again, you'll have a blade of plastic grass going places where grass should not go. Fortunately, we were given some protective goggles.\n\nThere were definitely times when we were wearing the suits for about six or seven hours because they had to make alterations. There were about eight practices in total, with the last three lasting 12 hours each.\n\nBut the production crew did their best to make this suit as wearable as possible; they listened to every complaint and tried to fix it.\n\nAnd getting to see behind the scenes of the production was a treat.\n\nIt was really cool to see Bad Bunny perform just a foot away. But because he was in LA for the Grammys during some of our rehearsals, the crew had a Bad Bunny stand-in they called \"Good Rabbit.\"\n\nOne of the other things they asked for in the application was whether you had marching band experience or experience in the entertainment industry. I was in a collegiate a capella group, so I'm not scared of performing in front of big crowds.\n\nBut it's definitely different when you have a stadium full of people vibing, moving, grooving to Bad Buddy's music.\n\nI spent about $2,600 on flights, hotels, and a rental car for the two weeks. I'm a content creator without a full time job now, so I didn't have to take any paid time off for this.\n\nThe hardest part of the whole thing wasn't the long hours or the heavy costume, but rather keeping quiet about it. They made us sign an NDA to not talk about it or post anything on social media for two weeks.\n\nSo when I saw people posting about what his setlist was going to be, it was so hard to have so much knowledge and power and not be able to do anything with it.\n\nI told only a very small handful of people that I was going to San Francisco and would be involved in the half-time show.\n\nI didn't tell them what I was dressed as. I didn't tell them where to look for me on the field. All I said was, \"You're going to see me. You just didn't know that you saw me.\"",

    "description": "Bad Bunny celebrated Puerto Rico at the 2026 Super Bowl, where he became the first Spanish-speaking solo artist to headline the halftime show. Trump hated it.",
    "fullText": "When Bad Bunny took the field at the 2026 Super Bowl for a historic, joyful halftime show, he wore a jersey with his Latino heritage stitched into its very fabric.\n\nIt's an apt metaphor for his performance, which eschewed explicit anti-ICE statements (he covered that at the Grammys, anyway) in favor of celebration with a side of symbolism.\n\nNods to the Puerto Rican singer's motherland were peppered throughout the set, which was designed to evoke the US territory's signature aesthetics, from sugar cane fields to a storefront labeled \"La Marqueta\" (a slang term for market) and various vendors selling tacos and piraguas (shaved ice). While performing \"El Apagón,\" a song about the frequent blackouts and infrastructure issues affecting Puerto Ricans, Bad Bunny brought this symbolism to the forefront, waving the Puerto Rican flag.\n\nHe also proclaimed in English, \"God bless America,\" and brandished a football printed with the phrase \"Together, We Are America.\" He added in Spanish, \"We're still here.\" (Puerto Rico is a US territory, and Puerto Ricans are American citizens.)\n\nIt was a stark and knowing contrast to the Latinophobia and anti-immigrant messaging hawked by the Trump administration. So much so that President Donald Trump complained online about Bad Bunny's performance and his choice to sing primarily in Spanish.\n\n\"The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social after Bad Bunny left the stage. \"Nobody understands a word this guy is saying.\"\n\nFor those who understand visual storytelling, however, Bad Bunny's performance made perfect sense. He didn't need to say \"ICE out\" or declare an explicit political opinion. In keeping with the recent tradition of Super Bowl halftime shows, Bad Bunny used iconography to take a stand instead.\n\nBad Bunny's performance shares DNA with Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl appearances, both of which used bold imagery to make strong statements.\n\nBeyoncé's surprise appearance at Coldplay's 2016 Super Bowl halftime show became famous — and, to some, infamous — for the iconography present in her performance of her then-new single, \"Formation.\" In the midst of Trump's first presidential campaign, Beyoncé and her backup dancers wore outfits that channeled the Black Panther Party, an organization formed amid the '60s Civil Rights Movement that fought for Black liberation.\n\nThe song itself isn't explicitly political. But as a celebration of identity and legacy that features lyrics about Beyoncé's parents, her daughter, and her features (\"I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils\"), Beyoncé performing it — with visual references to the song's themes in her and her dancers' costumes, to boot — was innately political.\n\nIt's not that Beyoncé is allergic to making explicit political statements: She famously performed in front of the word \"Feminist\" at the 2014 VMAs, and sang \"Votin' out 45, don't get out of line\" on her 2022 album \"Renaissance,\" referring to Trump as the 45th president. But when the NFL hosts musicians for the night, they've lately preferred make their statements symbolic rather than overt.\n\nLast year, Kendrick Lamar followed suit during his own Super Bowl halftime show, outfitting himself and his dancers in red, white, and blue. Although Lamar kept the music focused on his own enemies and triumphs, he used audacious visual language to pose broader, poignantly relevant questions: Who's allowed to claim patriotism? What does it mean to be an American, especially in times of oppression and conflict?\n\nBad Bunny's performance raised similar questions, but offered simpler, more optimistic solutions. For the finale, he was surrounded by backup dancers, band members, and other performers holding flags from around the world; when he proclaimed \"God bless America,\" he listed out all the countries in both North and South America.\n\nBad Bunny is not a politician, nor can he single-handedly cure the world of hatred and division. Still, for a brief moment, on a small square of American turf, he chose to use the stage to show millions of people what that could look like.",

    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime show was more than a hit-filled performance — it was a carefully staged cultural statement.\n\nBeyond the headline moments, the show was packed with intentional details, from visual symbolism to casting choices, that were easy to miss in real time.\n\nWe've rounded up the moments you might not have caught, and why they mattered.\n\nBad Bunny's halftime show featured several celebrity cameos from the likes of Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin, Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G, Jessica Alba, and Young Miko.\n\nLady Gaga appeared in a blue dress and sang a salsa rendition of her chart-topping hit \"Die With a Smile,\" while fellow Puerto Rican native Ricky Martin took to the stage to perform Bad Bunny's \"Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii.\"\n\nMaria Antonia Cay, known as Toñita, also made a cameo, briefly appearing onstage to hand Bad Bunny a drink. She runs Caribbean Social Club in Williamsburg, one of the last Puerto Rican social clubs in New York City.\n\nA couple featured in Bad Bunny's performance actually got married during the set, league sources confirmed to ESPN.\n\nThe outlet said that the couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to their wedding. Instead, the singer invited them to get married during his show.\n\nToward the end of his performance, Bad Bunny switched to English and said, \"God Bless America.\" He went on to list countries from South America up to North America as dancers walked behind him holding the respective flags — he finished with the United States and Canada.\n\nHe then closed his performance by holding up a football stamped with the words \"Together, We Are America\" and spiking it on the field.\n\nDuring his performance of \"El Apagón,\" a song whose title translates to \"the power outage,\" Bad Bunny leaned into the track's themes about the frequent blackouts in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe stage featured his dancers dressed as jíbaros, or traditional Puerto Rican farmers, who began climbing utility poles that sparked and exploded.\n\nBad Bunny brought Puerto Rico to Levi's Stadium by covering the stage in greenery inspired by Vega Baja, where he grew up.\n\nIn another stadium, that kind of lush landscape would typically be created by wheeling carts of plant props onto the field, Bruce Rodgers, whose company Tribe Inc. handled the show's production design, told Wired.\n\nBut NFL rules limited how many carts could be used to protect Levi's Stadium's natural grass, so the team dressed performers as plants to get the same effect, Rodgers said\n\nBad Bunny's halftime performance featured several cultural symbols of Puerto Rico, including sugar cane fields, a piragua stand, and a casita.\n\nAs fireworks lit up the sky to mark the end of Bad Bunny's halftime performance, a stadium screen displayed the message, \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love.\"\n\nThe quote echoed a line from the singer's Grammy acceptance speech last week.\n\nWhile accepting the award for best música urbana album, Bad Bunny called out ICE.\n\n\"We're not savage,\" he said. \"We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\nLater that night, Bad Bunny also made history as the first artist to win Album of the Year with an all-Spanish record.",

    "description": "Driving is too scary, expensive, and exhausting for Gen Z. So they're waiting to get a license and making their parents ferry them around.",
    "fullText": "As a mom of three kids, Christina Mott had been counting the days until her oldest son, Colton, got his driver's license.\n\nIt falls on her to drive each of them — age 10, 12, and 16 — to three different charter schools every day, and then to extracurriculars and social outings. \"Having him able to drive himself would free up a lot of time,\" she says. If only.\n\nWhile out one day on his learner's permit, Colton rolled through a red light and a stop sign. He panicked and decided to put his license on hold indefinitely. \"Getting in crashes, that's something that scares me a lot,\" Colton explains.\n\nThat means his mom is still chauffeuring three kids around their Northern California suburb. Christina, who's 46, says a lot of her fellow parents are going through the same thing: Teenagers are slamming the brakes on the time-honored rite of passage of getting a license at 16, either out of fear or because they're put off by the process or the costs. And that means a lot of Gen X parents are stuck behind the wheel longer than they bargained for.\n\n\"When I was 16, we didn't think this way about driving at all. Driving meant freedom!\" Christina says.\n\nEven so, she admits Colton doesn't feel quite as ready for a license as she was at 16. \"He's not very observant and tends to live in his own world,\" she says. \"I don't think, without GPS, that he would even know how to get to the grocery store from our house that we've lived in for eight years. So, the idea of him dealing with traffic lights and other drivers makes me nervous, too.\"\n\nIn 1983, roughly half of US 16-year-olds had a driver's license. That number fell to 25% in 2022, according to data from the Federal Highway Administration. Most teens will eventually get their licenses, the data shows — they're just waiting a lot longer.\n\nEven Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber — a beneficiary of the Delayed Driver trend — says it's caught him off guard. In an interview on the Verge's \"Decoder\" podcast last May, Khosrowshahi revealed he'd been struggling to convince his 18-year-old son to get a license.\n\n\"It drives me crazy,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"I don't know about you, but did you get a license the minute you could drive? It was just such a thing. It was a goal in life. It represented freedom.\"\n\nDelayed Driving goes hand in hand with a broader trend: Gen Z is falling behind older generations across a range of social markers. They're having less sex and waiting longer to couple off and start families. They don't go out as much and drink less alcohol, in part because it's so easy to socialize, shop, and order meals online.\n\n\"If you think of why those 16-year-olds — 30 or 50 years ago — were so eager to get their license, a lot of it had to do with wanting to drink and have sex,\" says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts and author of \"Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties.\"\n\nThat's still the case — Gen Z is just slowing down the march into adulthood.\n\nAdd to that the convenience of rideshare apps like Uber and the promise of self-driving cars, and the urgency of getting a license has diminished. \"They don't see their future as necessarily involving a car,\" Arnett said. He believes the trend will be a boon for autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe situation has sent a lot of Gen X parents to online forums like Reddit to complain that they're \"chauffeuring kids old enough to drive themselves.\" One described her kid as a \"21-year-old passenger prince.\"\n\nRather than teenagers begging their parents to let them drive, more parents are the ones doing the begging.\n\n\"It's almost like pushing him off the cliff,\" Giselle Rodriguez Greenwood, who lives in the suburbs of Houston, says of her 17-year-old son's resistance to getting a license.\n\nIt's the same for his classmates, nearly all of whom still depend on their parents or their friends' parents to get them around. \"It becomes 'rock, paper, scissors' as far as who's going to take who to whose house,\" Greenwood says. \"We have a text thread of lacrosse parents, and that's where we make the plea for help.\"\n\nLike Mott, Greenwood is not unsympathetic to her teen's reluctance. Houston is consistently ranked among the most unsafe cities for driving. She wonders if she's more of a helicopter parent than she realizes. \"Sometimes, I fear I may have imparted my fears on him,\" she says.\n\nIndeed, a lot of parents worry about pushing their teens to drive before they're ready — or have a handle on their screen use. A 2025 study by Mass General Brigham found that teenage drivers spent about 21% of car rides glancing at their phones, and about 26% of those glances lasted 2 seconds or longer. Even if they put their phones away, growing up with screens can change how Gen Zers navigate the road.\n\nStill, driving is an essential skill, and Greenwood plans to take a harder line with her younger son, who's 14. \"I'm just throwing him behind the wheel as soon as he can,\" she says. \"I'm not doing this again.\"\n\nEven a strong parental nudge isn't always enough to get a kid to the DMV. When Sarah Wilson, a mother of three in Nashville, stopped offering to ferry her 16-year-old around town, her daughter didn't She's now in college, and still doesn't know how to drive. She gets around mostly on her bike or by catching a ride with friends.\n\n\"It becomes frustrating when she can't help with long drives or simple errands,\" says Wilson, who's 50. \"It's a form of independence I want her to have, even if she's been slow to claim it.\"\n\nRobert Roble, a Lyft driver in Auburn, Georgia, a small city 42 miles from Atlanta, has noticed an uptick in the number of driving-age teens requesting rides to afterschool jobs, sports practice, or the mall. \"I had a 22-year-old this week that hadn't gotten his driver's license yet,\" says Roble, who's 59.\n\nBoth Lyft and Uber have reported that fewer Gen Z drivers have translated to more business for rideshare companies. \"The data shows that most 16-year-olds, at this point, are not that interested in a driver's license,\" Uber president Andrew Macdonald said in a recent interview.\n\nFor some families, even the occasional rideshare surge pricing makes more financial sense when you account for the combined costs of driving school, an extra car, and the price of gas.\n\nThe cost of a used car has soared in recent years, thanks in part to tariffs and supply chain slowdowns, as have monthly auto insurance premiums. Meanwhile, fewer public schools offer free driver's ed programs, the global research firm IBISWorld reported last year, adding to the logistical and financial hurdles of getting a driver's license.\n\nIn a few states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, licensed teenagers are limited to how many friends they can pick up in their cars. In California, for example, a teenager under 18 has to wait a year before they can carpool with all their friends. The law prohibits having anyone under 20 in their car without an adult over 25 present. \"With that restriction, it takes a lot of the fun out of it,\" says Colton, the Northern California teen.\n\nNina McCollum, who lives in Ohio, says cost was a factor in her 16-year-old son not immediately getting his license. The state requires formal driver's education to apply for a license, and McCollum was hit with sticker shock when she looked into it. \"The cheapest I've found from a reputable provider is like $700,\" says McCollum, who's 57.\n\nThe family decided to delay the classes for a few months, and McCollum has been giving her son informal lessons in the meantime.\n\nWhat has surprised her is that it often feels like it's her — rather than her teenager — who's antsy for him to drive. None of her son's close friends have licenses, even though they're old enough; they're all dependent on their parents to drive them to band practice and basketball games.\n\n\"It's really hard to force a 16-year-old to do things,\" she says. \"It's not like he's going out all the time, and I can ground him.\"\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm to drive doesn't change the fact that most of America is heavily car-dependent. More than 9 in 10 households have at least one car, and 87% of people drive every day.\n\nUnless you live in a few walkable US cities with solid mass transit, not driving means relying on other people for carpools, timing your outings to bus schedules, spending a lot on Taxis and rideshares, or walking in areas simply not built for it.\n\nFor years, that's how Alma Benitez got by. \"Since I come from a first-gen household, the mentality is that the man is a provider and is always able to drive you around,\" says Benitez, who's now 24. As a license-less teen, she relied on her dad and brother for rides; otherwise, she walked or took public transportation in White Plains, New York.\n\nUltimately, it held her back. \"Because I didn't drive, most of my jobs and school locations would have to be a commutable walk or bus transportation ride,\" she said. \"So it kind of limited me.\"\n\nShe finally got her license three years ago, when she was 21. Benitez now makes TikToks for new drivers, offering instructions for how to pump gas or make smooth turns. Most of the comments under her videos are from people in their late 20s. \"A lot of people are really scared to get on the road,\" she says.\n\nBack in California, Colton Mott is trying to win back his confidence about driving. He's again taking driving lessons and has an appointment for his test at his local DMV. His mom signed him up for both.\n\n\"I feel really good about him driving again,\" she says. \"He's been asking to drive every day.\"\n\nJulia Pugachevsky is a senior health reporter on Business Insider's health team.",

    "description": "Private equity assets under management swelled to an estimated $6.7 trillion in 2025, up 72% over the last five years.",
    "fullText": "A lot of people are about to get rich from OpenAI's expected IPO. You probably won't be one of them.\n\nRetail investors will eventually get their shot. They'll be able to buy the stock, maybe even turn a tidy profit, once the company goes public. But they'll be showing up late to the party. As usual the real money, the kind that changes lives, will have already been made.\n\nThis isn't a one-off. It's a pattern that's becoming more common as companies stay private longer. Last year's post-IPO pops from names like CoreWeave and Figma showered early backers with riches. For everyday investors, it was a familiar gut punch. Both stocks now trade significantly below last year's highs.\n\nReddit and other online forums are littered with retailer investors complaining about being \"exit liquidity\" for venture capitalists and executives who cashed out early positions for huge gains. Individual investors who bought near the top are now left holding the bag.\n\nThe retail crowd knows they're missing out. That fuels resentment. Locked out of private markets, everyday investors often watch the biggest wealth-creation moments happen without them. If broad participation is supposed to be a pillar of capitalism, why has so much of the action moved behind a velvet rope?\n\nFor better or worse, many of those barriers to entry are coming down. Financial institutions are rolling out new products in private equity and credit markets aimed at everyday investors.\n\n\"The train has indeed left the station,\" said Stanford finance professor Amit Seru. \"The industry sees a once-in-a-generation chance to tap a vast pool of new capital.\"\n\nIn the latest installment of Business Insider's \"Future of Capitalism\" series, we explore the push to \"democratize\" private markets and what it means for retail investors. Retail access is expanding to investments that would've been unheard of years ago. They're finally getting a seat at the private-markets table.\n\nThe question now is whether that seat will ultimately be worth the risk.\n\nFor years, private markets swelled in size without much fanfare. That's changing.\n\n\"What we're finding is a lot of people are more curious about what they don't know about private markets,\" said Monish Verma, the CEO of Vardhan Wealth Management. \"They've been hearing more about it. They understand it's more than just equities and bonds.\"\n\nInvestment managers are looking to meet the moment.\n\nPrivate equity assets under management swelled to an estimated $6.7 trillion in 2025, up 72% over the last five years, according to data from the analytics firm Preqin. The firm predicts this number will swell to nearly $12 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nAssets under management in private credit investments rose to $2.2 trillion last year, an 86% increase over the same time frame. Preqin predicts this will surge to $4.5 trillion by decade's end.\n\nUS policymakers have been warming to the idea that private markets should be opened up to more investors. In August, the SEC reversed a rule that had previously limited access to certain closed-end funds. That nudged the door to private markets a little wider for investors who are \"non-accredited,\" or those with a lower net worth than the markets are typically opened to.\n\n\"Financial innovation sometimes means getting out of the way of capital formation and allowing all investors to gain the benefits of our robust markets,\" Paul Atkins, the chair of the regulatory agency, said in prepared remarks last May.\n\nPrivate-market funds have been rolling out investment vehicles that aren't just for the ultra-rich. In the last year or so, the likes of KKR, State Street, and Apollo have launched a series of new funds and ETF products that offer the public access to public and private credit. SoFi, meanwhile, has debuted a handful of private markets funds specifically aimed at retail investors, with minimum investment requirements as low as $500.\n\n\"I certainly think it's not a fad,\" Robert Callagy, associate managing director at Moody's Investors Service, told Business Insider about the slowly expanding access to private investments.\n\nInvesting in public assets is inherently risky. In the event a company goes under, stock investors get paid last, if at all, with whatever is left over after a company reimburses its creditors.\n\nBut private markets are a different animal entirely, and come with their own unique set of risks. Some key differences might catch investors off guard, Callagy and Seru said.\n\nFor one, retail investors are used to being able to access their money easily. Private assets are less liquid and can be tougher to sell if you want to offload. SoFi's Cashmere Fund, which offers access to growth-stage companies backed by VCs, explicitly notes that it's aimed at long-term investors who don't need quick access to cash.\n\nRetail traders usually expect their money to be put to work right away, in vehicles like ETFs and mutual funds, Callagy said. This is often not the case for private-market funds, which tend to hold significant cash positions as managers scan the market for opportunities. The amount of private-equity money on the sidelines has been near record levels in recent quarters.\n\nThere also tends to be an information gap. Private companies aren't required to publicly disclose their earnings, debt, or other financial information. It's more difficult for an investor to know exactly what they're buying.\n\nCallagy says that the pressure to put cash to work could lead to more lax underwriting standards by money managers dealing with limited information.\n\nWhile access to private markets has expanded, retail investors, some of the supposed beneficiaries who spoke with Business Insider, don't seem convinced. The prevailing mood is distrust. Many see a version of capitalism where institutions still win, even as markets are branded more \"democratic.\"\n\nBilaal Dhalech, a 29-year-old day trader and an electrical engineer based in Toronto, is interested in accessing private companies because he feels like institutions currently have a leg up on him.\n\n\"They're getting in early, riding the value creation, and then exiting after the IPO,\" he told Business Insider, noting the post-offering stock skids that have befallen many recent market debutants.\n\n\"Having access earlier would level the playing field and absolutely change outcomes,\" Dhalech added.\n\nMinwoo Lim, a full-time trader who lives in Dubai, is more outright skeptical. In an interview, he said he believes institutional investors will continue to have an edge over the retail crowd, no matter how accessible private markets become. In his view, alternative asset managers will simply create a new structure that once again limits the most enticing private opportunities to institutions.\n\n\"If a private deal is available to retail, it's usually because the good part is already gone,\" Lim said. \"Institutions already took the real upside.\"\n\nDavid Villalobos, a trader based in Colorado, is more ambivalent. He said he's not interested in branching out into private markets, and that most retail traders have a tough time navigating public markets as they are.\n\n\"From my perspective, this push resembles prior bubbles we've seen in financial history,\" he said. \"Retail participants are likely to be attracted more by the narrative than the substance.\"\n\nIf Wall Street feels that skepticism, it isn't showing in its pursuit of expanding the reach of private markets.\n\nThe private equity industry has already successfully lobbied to allow private credit instruments into retirement funds, and big asset managers tout the benefits of diversification.\n\n\"You really need to be adding that private market exposure as a source of income, as well as a source of lower volatility,\" said Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for its Americas division.\n\nShe conceded that it's not for everyone, though.\n\n\"There's a liquidity premium that you will pay for that, but you're supposed to make that decision based on the portfolio that you have and the liquidity biases that you have.\"\n\nGoverning bodies have been clear that guardrails are needed. In a report from last fall, the SEC suggested a series of checks and balances designed to protect retail investors, ranging from investment limits to more robust disclosure requirements.\n\nSeru said he also believes in safeguards, like limits on the amount of illiquid private market assets allowed in ETFs. He also thinks there needs to be more transparency about who will provide liquidity in the market if there's a stress event.\n\nEventually, Seru says, the line between private and public markets will start to blur, to the point where the historical advantages of private markets are eroded.\n\n\"At some point, the quest for scale becomes self-defeating,\" he said.\n\nEven with rules in place, Seru only recommends private market funds to investors who can handle putting money into relatively illiquid funds for a long period of time.\n\n\"Done poorly, democratization simply transforms a high-performing asset class into a systemic risk machine,\" he added.",

    "description": "OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said specialized AI, not AGI or LLMs, is a better future for the technology.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, many investors, founders, and tech giants often frame AI as an all-powerful force — something approaching omniscience.\n\nThey call it artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical system capable of matching or exceeding human reasoning across virtually all tasks and, beyond that, superintelligence, which would surpass human cognition altogether.\n\nAGI is the thing OpenAI and its competitors are racing to be the first to bring to life.\n\nThe industry isn't a monolith, however, nor are its builders.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the now-viral personal AI assistant powering the agent-only social network, Moltbook, told the Y Combinator podcast on Saturday that he thinks the best AI is specialized, not generalized.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" he said. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"\n\nHe said the same holds true for AI. Current AI systems are labeled as \"general.\" In practice, however, they are already specialized for particular tasks — like startups building models to solve Erdos math problems or identify gene mutations.\n\nWhile the hype around AI has largely focused on the types of models being built — from large language models to computer vision systems or even world models — some startups and tech giants are also experimenting with more focused, subject-specific forms of intelligence.\n\nAxiom, a startup founded by former Meta researcher Carina Hong and backed by $64 million in seed funding, for instance, is building specialized intelligence to tackle advanced mathematics.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has developed AlphaGenome, a system designed to predict how variants or mutations in human DNA affect a wide range of gene-regulating biological processes.\n\nCompanies are also developing smaller models, which could make it easier to build AI systems tailored to specific subjects or domains. Aidan Gomez, the CEO of Cohere, which builds AI technology for enterprises, told Business Insider in 2024 that there was increasing pressure to build \"smaller, more efficient models\" and to make them smarter with the right data and algorithms, rather than just scaling them.\n\nSteinberger is not the only one to push back against the idea of an all-powerful general intelligence.\n\nTimnit Gebru, a computer scientist who founded and leads the Distributed AI Research Institute, said AGI is a \"fictional thing\" in a November video published by Nature.\n\nShe said the backbone of engineering lies in building well-scoped, testable systems. The pursuit of a \"fictional, undefined 'machine god,'\" she said, is pushing the industry toward deeper labor exploitation and environmental damage.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for launching the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to build with AI. He said the technology has come a long way since he started, when his goal was simply to build \"something that could type stuff so my computer could do things.\"",

    "description": "Former Real Housewives of New York star Bethenny Frankel moved to Florida last year. She's in her 'nightgown era' and is building a dating community.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 55-year-old Bethenny Frankel, former star of The Real Housewives of New York City and founder of The Core, a private dating membership community. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have a much bigger business now than when I was on The Real Housewives of New York City, was running Skinnygirl, my lifestyle brand famous for its low-calorie cocktails, and landed on the cover of Forbes.\n\nI got a big one-time check when I sold the liquor arm of Skinnygirl, but what I'm doing now, through The Core, my private dating membership community, influencing, and investing, is bigger than ever.\n\nI'm busy, but I'm not sitting at a desk every day. My brain works well, I have a phone, and that's really all I need. I wrote most of my New York Times bestselling books on a BlackBerry.\n\nHere's a typical day in my life.\n\nI wake up fairly early. I let the dogs out, then go give my daughter a hug and a kiss if she lets me in her room for a second. I really love that. I tend to troll her by sitting on her bed for a few minutes, but I've learned that teens don't like to talk in the morning.\n\nI make myself a strong iced coffee with my Cumulus coffee maker and feed the dogs. My dogs are really important to me, and I try to get as many good snuggles in with them as I can.\n\nBetween 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., I usually go for a walk on the beach. I moved from New York to South Florida in March 2025, and I love wandering around like a weirdo on the beach. I often finish the walks by jumping into the sea.\n\nI like taking calls while walking on the beach. In the morning, these are usually with one team member handling brand partnerships and appearances, and with my COO, where we discuss bigger deals, contract negotiations, and my investments.\n\nSince we launched The Core in December, it's taken up a big part of my day. It brings together the trust I've built as an entrepreneur with my crazy Rolodex of incredibly powerful and successful people.\n\nI'm passionate about it, and passion is my thing. When I start obsessing over something — it was the same with BStrong, my disaster-relief initiative I launched in 2017 in response to that year's devastating hurricane season — it's the only thing I'm talking about.\n\nLike every other business I've run, it's a case of building the plane while flying it. A lot of the work involves responding to texts and voice-noting somebody, asking them to do something.\n\nIf someone wants to get on the phone with me, I'll often take the call while I'm in the car. Otherwise, that time is wasted, and I don't waste time, food, or money.\n\nMy days aren't tightly structured, and I don't like feeling shackled by having too many things I have to do. The day often gets away from me before I've even showered, and my team will remind me that I have 15 minutes until I need to record my podcast, \"Just B with Bethenny Frankel.\"\n\nI record the episodes at home. Mostly, I don't care about having guests on. If I talk about my pillowcases and the bacterial facial infection I got on vacation, it will rate just as well as having Madonna.\n\nI'll usually rant for about an hour. I only like to sit and talk about what I want to talk about. It's almost like my own personal therapy monologue.\n\nThis year, I've been more open to meeting people for meals and coffee.\n\nOtherwise, I have my \"supermodel snacks\" for lunch, often seaweed stuffed with salad or turkey or rice cakes with avocado or cottage cheese.\n\nI don't plan to record my social media videos; it's mostly spontaneous. I don't post them as much as I used to. I've told my team I only want to put out excellent content, not filler.\n\nOften, my posts are just about something that's happened to me, and that leads companies to want to do brand deals. Once a week, I bang out those brand videos. The companies send the products to my home, and I film for two to three hours.\n\nI'm constantly being sent expensive things by major brands, from mattresses to nonalcoholic drinks to vape pipes. I also buy a lot of products to try myself. Once that stuff arrives, I want it out of my house as quickly as possible.\n\nAs a result, gift-giving has become a huge part of my day. If anyone does anything nice for me, whether it's at the nail salon or anywhere else, I want to give them a gift. I feel like the universe gave the \"get stuff\" crown to the right person: I like to share the wealth.\n\nIn the evenings, I try to protect my peace and avoid getting too activated by anything. I like to find a TV series that has thousands of episodes to work through. Right now, that's The Walking Dead, which I've been watching in my nightgown. I'm in my nightgown era. I also like to take a bath before I go to sleep.\n\nI listen to my body. I'm an efficient, very organized person, but I'm also a lounger, a pyjama-wearer, and a relaxer. I chill a decent amount each day.\n\nI also listen to my body for cues on when to eat or snack. I'll make dinner reservations, but often change them because I'm not hungry enough.\n\nI couldn't care less about traditional meal times.\n\nThe other night, I went to Trader Joe's and cooked a big dinner at home for my daughter, the guy I'm seeing, and a girlfriend. In Florida, I'm more sociable than I was in New York. I'm actually seeing other human life, outside of dating or being paid.\n\nWhat I cook often depends on what's already in the fridge. I enjoy the process of taking ingredients out, laying them out on the counter, and cooking.\n\nI also feel pride that my daughter sees that, even with how busy I am with my career, I'm able to do this really normal thing for her. That's meaningful for me.",

    "fullText": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish Airlines still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.\n\nThese rare culinary specialists, who are separate from flight attendants, take food orders, plate meals in the galley, and oversee premium service on long-haul flights.\n\nThe role is designed to make dining feel closer to a restaurant than standard airline catering — but chefs don't actually cook from scratch due to flight safety rules. They use ovens to heat and finish pre-prepared meals and then arrange the presentation.\n\nThese chefs also take customer feedback from the air to help improve and develop meals in catering kitchens on the ground.\n\nI recently experienced the unique service on a 10-hour flight from Istanbul to New York in January. Considering Turkish won Skytrax's 2025 awards for Europe's best business class and best business class catering, I was eager to see how the seat and food measured up.\n\nI strategically chose the Boeing 787 for its modern business cabin; the Boeing 777 that also flies the route doesn't have the nicer design.\n\nBetween the lie-flat seat, the large TV, and the restaurant-style meals, the cabin felt like my living room on a lazy Saturday night.\n\nI slept well and appreciated the wide variety of food, from poached eggs and swordfish to a trolley full of savory appetizers.\n\nHere's what the full experience was like. Business Insider paid a media rate for the business class upgrade to New York.\n\nTurkish's Istanbul business class lounge is unreal, with cooked-to-order meals like omelettes and kebabs, drink stations, and sleep suites that feel like mini hotel rooms.\n\nMy layover time qualified me for a suite, but they're first-come, first-served — I was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable I slept five hours straight, with a shared bathroom and shower just across the hall.\n\nI chose seat 8A, in the last row, for privacy and to be among the first to deplane. Although it's right by the galley and lavatory nearest the boarding door, I didn't notice much noise with headphones on.\n\nMost Turkish business cabins don't have doors. Some A350s do, and the airline is planning a new \"Crystal Business Class\" with sliding doors, but most planes — including the 787 I flew on — still don't.\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker by any means, and the seat wings help cocoon the space a bit, but there is less overall privacy than with a door.\n\nThe business class seats lie fully flat, and mine felt both spacious and cozy. I could comfortably sleep on my stomach, and I particularly liked the mattress pad and the dual-texture blanket, which has a soft plush on one side.\n\nI also appreciated the 1-2-1 cabin that let me freely reach the aisle. Many of Turkish's old planes still have 2-3-2 layouts that force middle and window-seat travelers to crawl over their neighbor to reach the restroom.\n\nThe seat had multiple storage spots: a cabinet, a footrest cubby, and a slim seatback pocket — plus an overhead bin to myself.\n\nI stashed my purse, Kindle, chargers, boots, backpack, and jacket without feeling cramped.\n\nThe seat's television was large and fully controllable via a handheld remote. I watched \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Fast and Furious,\" and an Agatha Christie-style whodunit called \"Murder at the Embassy.\"\n\nInstead of a flight attendant, a dedicated flying chef takes orders, plates meals, and preps appetizer and dessert carts.\n\nMost of the menu — like meats and soups — are fully or nearly fully cooked on the ground in airline kitchens, but finished in the air by the chef and cabin crew using onboard ovens.\n\nThe cabin crew still hands out drinks and hot towels, but with meals covered, I imagine they can better focus on other tasks.\n\nAll of the food was served on real dishware and with flatware — no cheap plastic.\n\nTurkish offers a \"dining-on-demand\" strategy that lets passengers choose when they want to eat.\n\nFor example, I slept a few hours after breakfast before requesting tea, though the crew member also brought me a small sandwich. It was simple — handcrafted with a roll, lettuce, and cheese — but perfect while I watched a movie.\n\nThere were also free snacks available throughout the flight, like popcorn, fruit, mixed nuts, chocolate, cookies, and chips.\n\nThe breakfast started with appetizers: fresh juice, fruit salad, cheeses, smoked turkey, marinated olives, and bread with butter and jam.\n\nThe entrée options included poached eggs with a savory sauce called shakshuka, spinach-and-cheese stuffed pastries and flatbreads (börek and gözleme), and sweet curd crepes with fruit and berry sauce.\n\nI had the poached eggs, which were prepared on the ground but were still fluffy with a perfectly runny yolk on the plane.\n\nThe second meal included a huge range of appetizers: octopus salad, salmon tartare, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, fried aubergine, beef patties, chicken salad, cheese, red pepper soup, creamy pea soup, and Köpoğlu (essentially Turkish eggplant caviar).\n\nEverything was arranged on a trolley by the chef and rolled down the galley for passengers to pick and choose; the presentation made the experience feel more fancy, and everything was tasty.\n\nBesides Turkish, select Saudia, Austrian Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia flights feature onboard chefs.\n\nTurkish's chefs, staffed through catering partner DO&CO, also spend time at meal-prep facilities, providing feedback and helping maintain quality — a hands-on approach that shows in the in-flight service.\n\nI rarely check luggage, but I had too many souvenirs this time.\n\nLuckily, my bag survived the transfer from Zagreb, Croatia, and arrived in New York safe and sound.",

    "title": "AI agents failed at real-world consulting tasks — but Mercor's CEO says they're still on track to replace consultants",
    "description": "Mercor found AI agents failed at most consulting tasks, but its CEO says the models are improving so rapidly consultants should be worried.",
    "fullText": "New research suggests an AI agent can't fully replace a human consultant — at least for now.\n\nMercor, the AI training giant, tested how well leading AI models, acting as agents, performed real-world consulting, banking, and legal tasks.\n\nThe models failed most of the time, but Mercor's CEO, Brendan Foody, told Business Insider that the results tell only part of the story.\n\nThe consulting tasks in Mercor's APEX-Agents benchmark were designed to simulate real management consulting work, based on expert surveys and input from consultants at McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, Accenture, and EY.\n\nAcross all task categories, the AI agents successfully completed the tasks less than 25% of the time on the first try. Given eight attempts, the agents could only complete 40% of the tasks. For the management consulting tasks, OpenAI's GPT 5.2 initially performed the best, completing nearly 23% of the tasks on its first attempt. Anthropic's Opus 4.6, released this week, performed even better at nearly 33%.\n\nWhile many of the tasks were not completed, Foody said the success rate for GPT 3 was only 3%, compared to 23% for GPT 5.2. Anthropic's model went from 13% to 33% on consulting tasks in a matter of months. Foody said he expects the success rate of the models to be closer to 50% by the end of the year.\n\n\"These are some of the hardest tasks in the economy that people pay millions of dollars to consulting firms to do, and the models are finally being able to do them with an incredible rate of progress,\" Foody said.\n\nAI has already disrupted the consulting industry, changing the way firms hire and make money, but the likelihood of agents displacing consultants grows as the models continue to improve.\n\nMcKinsey chief Bob Sternfels recently said the prestigious management consulting firm had 60,000 employees, 25,000 of which were AI agents.\n\nSternfels recently said it's the first time in McKinsey's history that the company is able to grow without growing its head count.\n\nThe frontier models Mercor tested included those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, among others.\n\nOne example consulting task instructed the AI agent to \"analyze category consumption patterns and market penetration using the Category Penetration Score methodology for PureLife's portfolio strategy,\" asking for several specific outputs in response. The AI agents failed to produce an accurate response.\n\n\"No model is ready to replace a professional end-to-end,\" the findings concluded.\n\nMercor found the AI agents were great at research and pretty good at data analysis, Foody said.\n\nWhere they consistently got tripped up was on longer-horizon tasks — the longer it would take a human to complete a task, or the more steps it took, was the biggest indicator that the model might have a hard time.\n\nUnlike a human, Foody said, the models struggle to understand where in a specific file system they should look for the right information, so they often end up looking at the wrong files. They struggle with the planning side of figuring out how to work with multiple tools and cross-referencing files at the same time.\n\nFor tasks that can be done in an hour or less or that only require the use of a single tool, the models perform relatively well.\n\nFoody said the agents are almost like interns, where they might have a 50% pass rate, and the partner is still noticing a lot of issues in the work.\n\nFrank Jones, a former KPMG consultant who now works as an expert contractor for Mercor, said in his experience training AI, he's found the models can get close at certain tasks, but that some human refinement is often needed.\n\nHe also said the models need very specific prompts because they don't always understand common expectations or phrases in consulting, like \"client-ready.\"\n\n\"Most consultants, they know what that means. But for AI, I think there's a lot of nuance in that,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Foody, continuing to improve the models doesn't require a breakthrough — it requires more and better training, which the frontier labs are already investing heavily in.\n\n\"That's why we have so much revenue,\" he said, adding, \"We're in the business of replacing human judgment.\"\n\nMercor, whose clients have included OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, secured a funding deal in the fall that valued the company at $10 billion. Mercor employs more than 30,000 contractors around the world who help train AI models through tasks like rewriting chatbot responses. Foody previously said the company grew its revenue in 2025 by 4,658%.\n\nFoody said he believes consulting, and especially lower-level roles, are among the jobs he's confident will be displaced by AI. He said the next version of the AI agents benchmark will expand to evaluate the whole value chain of a professional services firm: \"Instead of evaling the analyst, we're evaling McKinsey itself.\"\n\nRight now, he says Mercor's AI agent benchmark tells an appealing story for McKinsey, because the company could say it shows they can use AI to add value but not replace humans.\n\n\"The next version of APEX tells a very scary story for McKinsey,\" he said, adding, \"In the coming two years, we're going to have chatbots that are as good as the best consulting firm.\"",

    "description": "Private equity's years-long waiting game has sparked a $240 billion race on Wall Street. Inside the battle between banks to dominate in secondaries.",
    "fullText": "In the world of high finance, the secondary market — selling off pre-owned investments — was once considered Wall Street's version of a used-car lot. Few junior bankers clamored for the role, and bulge-bracket giants largely left the field to specialized boutiques.\n\nBut those days are over, and America's biggest investment banks are aggressively piling in.\n\n\"I used to have to explain the first 10 minutes of an interview what we do,\" Todd Miller, the global cohead of secondary advisory at longtime key player Jefferies, told Business Insider. \"It's a very hot industry. Everyone's trying to get into this space.\"\n\nIn the post-pandemic years of high interest rates and muted valuations, a capital bottleneck has pushed private equity exits well past the industry's typical timeline. That delay has tested investors who backed PE funds and expected returns a long time ago. So-called \"secondary\" and \"continuation vehicles\" — structures that let PE firms shift ownership of a company from one fund to another, while giving existing investors the chance to cash out — have emerged as a key workaround.\n\nIn a recent report, Jefferies said secondaries drove $240 billion in global transaction volumes last year, a 48% increase from the year prior.\n\nIn late January, JPMorgan Chase announced a new \"center of excellence\" in its investment bank: the Private Capital Advisory and Solutions group. Led by veteran banker Keith Canton, the former head of equity capital markets in the Americas, the team will advise companies on a spectrum of liquidity solutions. The symbolism was notable: a banker once focused on taking companies public is now helping them stay private longer. His newly formed group will draw on members of the bank's existing teams focused on private capital markets and advisory, he told Business Insider, with more hires expected over the coming year.\n\nMiller told Business Insider that the pace of the activity has become breathless. The banker estimated he spends as much as 20% of his time on recruiting, and his team — which counts some 130 heads — has grown by 50% over the past two years.\n\n\"I get a massive amount of inbounds on LinkedIn,\" Miller said. \"I've had kids writing to me on LinkedIn out of college, sophomores at elite schools. They want to do this job.\"\n\nFor banks like JPMorgan, establishing Canton's group helps position the firm to compete for the wave of PE spending expected to begin in the coming months. Buyside firms are sitting on trillions in unspent capital, and banks want to be on speed dial when they decide to deploy it, whether through an M&A transaction, an eventual IPO, or a chance to help clients generate the liquidity they need in between.\n\n\"If you're just waiting for the IPO market,\" Canton said, \"you have potentially missed out on some significant gains.\"\n\nIn recent decades, the capital markets have experienced a sea change. Underwhelming IPO debuts and the red tape of being publicly traded dissuaded more corporate boards from taking the plunge.\n\nMatters got more complicated after stubbornly high interest rates spiked around 2022, pumping the brakes on corporate dealmaking. In 2020, PE firms were flipping companies they'd owned for an average of five years. In 2025, the timeframe had stretched by more than a year, according to data from the data provider Preqin, a subsidiary of BlackRock.\n\nOther banks have also been busy hiring. Last month, London-based banker Andrei Brougham joined Goldman Sachs from Rothschild to steer its EMEA secondaries advisory business. In 2025, Moelis poached Matt Wesley, then Jefferies' global head of private capital, to run its advisory team.\n\nIf they play their cards right, the potential upside for these desks is significant. A February report from JPMorgan found that 76% of family offices still have no secondary private equity exposure, illustrating how much runway remains.\n\n\"It's a big business opportunity,\" Canton concluded. \"It's one that is very clearly strategic to the firm. It's where we think the markets are broadly going.\"\n\nBrianne Sterling, a headhunter who leads the investment banking practice at recruiting firm Selby Jennings, has seen an uptick in clients looking to bolster their private fund advisory capabilities. \"I think it's a really big hiring story,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nPrivate credit secondaries professionals are in demand, she said, reflecting the anticipated $17 billion in credit secondaries for 2025 that Jefferies projected last summer. And she added that some banks are poaching juniors from valuation groups and Big Four accounting firms. Their skills come in handy with pricing, which is long the most fraught part of these transactions, as limited partners scrutinize whether pricing practices are inherently fair.\n\nThe next wave will be cultivating sector-specific talent. Miller said that Jefferies is building eight- to 10-person verticals focused on niche areas like venture capital and growth funds, infrastructure, energy, and private credit — an indication that demand for these jobs isn't going anywhere.",

    "description": "A software engineer at Microsoft took his health for granted before being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis Now, he's more thoughtful about how he spends his time and energy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Pronnoy Goswami, 31, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2022, I thought: Why me?\n\nI didn't have lots of bad habits, I hadn't abused my body, and it took me a long time to accept what was happening to me.\n\nI considered giving up my dream of solving meaningful problems in tech at scale, taking a career break to focus on my health, and leaving the US to go back to my home country of India.\n\nUltimately, I stayed in the US and continued with my career while making huge changes to my lifestyle and work routine. I'm proud of what I've achieved in tech in spite of my adversities, and along the way, I've found my voice and a new vision of success.\n\nWhen I first got sick in 2021, I was working in Washington as a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I'd spent two years in software engineering at McKinsey, and a few months interning at PayPal. I now work at a large enterprise software company.\n\nI was on a trip with my partner just before Thanksgiving when I had rectal bleeding and felt weak, but I didn't think it was anything more serious than hemorrhoids or food poisoning. My symptoms kept getting worse, even after I consulted doctors and took medication. I was going to the restroom 15 to 20 times a day, and I lost a lot of weight.\n\nDoctors noticed my gut was inflamed, and referred me to a gastroenterologist. I was very scared.\n\nA colonoscopy showed I have ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.\n\nI'm used to putting 100% into my work, and when I was diagnosed in 2022, I'd been working on projects at Microsoft I felt were impactful. I took three to four weeks of sick leave, then returned to work, but I was completely remote for a year after my diagnosis.\n\nMy body struggles to absorb nutrients, and I get tired very quickly. I've had to make many dietary changes to manage flare-ups, including cutting out caffeine, alcohol, lactose, chile, and red meat.\n\nWhen my wife and I went on honeymoon in Hawaii in August 2025, we planned the trip down to the restaurants I could eat at and what I'd order. But then I ate something I hadn't planned at a lūʻau, and I was sick for two days, which was disheartening.\n\nAt first, I was scared to tell people about my condition, but when I started sharing with my colleagues, I found people empathized and judged me according to my merits.\n\nI have bad days related to my condition 20% of the time, and sometimes have to step away for appointments and procedures. For example, I have a colonoscopy every year because ulcerative colitis puts me at higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. I always try to catch up with tasks in my own time, and accept that I have to achieve the same things as others in less time.\n\nI left Microsoft and started working at a large enterprise software company in 2023. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the allure of startups is all around. However, I'm not physically or mentally ready to take the leap of faith to work at one yet. The stability of my current job is vital for my health.\n\nI also need to be careful with what jobs I consider, because a workplace might not be a good fit if it has a strict policy of being in the office five days a week and doesn't make accommodations. Plus, I'm very happy where I am.\n\nBefore I got sick, I took my health for granted, but I've started treating my body like a temple and am careful with how I'm spending my energy. I've come to define success as being healthy, because it helps me solve problems at work better.\n\nIt's also given me a voice. My diagnosis made me want to be more purposeful with my time, so I started exploring creative passions, like writing a newsletter and technical blogs. I want to connect with like-minded people and not live in a shell.\n\nWhen I look back at what I've achieved in my career since my diagnosis, I feel God has been kind to me. I've done interesting, cutting-edge work in tech, like building important infrastructure.\n\nBut I'm not done yet. I'm still in the early innings of my career, and I have a long way to go.\n\nMicrosoft declined to respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating a diagnosis alongside your career?

    "description": "In a blog post, retired Microsoft CTO Jeffrey Snover said a leadership lesson he learned from CEO Satya Nadella changed his worldview.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is transforming the company's culture during his tenure, leaving a lasting impression on some current and former employees.\n\nThat includes Jeffrey Snover, a retired Microsoft chief technology officer and Google engineer, who recalled an \"actionable lesson in leadership\" he learned from Nadella in a recent blog post.\n\nIn short, he said, Nadella stressed that executives need to figure out how to succeed with the resources they have, rather than complain.\n\n\"If you are an exec and don't have the resources to support your strategy, you have the wrong strategy,\" Snover wrote. \"Quit whining and wasting time trying to get the resources to support that strategy — do your job — get a strategy that can work with the resources you have.\"\n\nIn a subsequent statement shared with Business Insider, Snover said he thinks Nadella is \"the best CEO in America by a very wide margin.\"\n\nIn the blog post, Snover recalled the speech Nadella gave during a meeting with Microsoft's senior executives that laid out the leadership lesson.\n\n\"Don't come whining that you don't have the resources you need. We've done our homework. We've evaluated the portfolio, considered the opportunities, and allocated our available resources to those opportunities,\" Nadella said, according to Snover. \"That is what you have to work with. Your job is to manufacture success with the resources you've been allocated.\"\n\nSnover wrote that Nadella, who became CEO in 2014, told executives they could control only two things: How they managed their teams and how they allocated resources.\n\n\"And I want to be clear with you. If you are in this room, you need to deliver outsized success. To do that, you will need to allocate resources ahead of conventional wisdom​,\" Nadella said. \"Conventional wisdom will generate conventional success, and that won't allow you to stay in this room. You need to have courage and be bold.\"\n\nSnover, who left Microsoft in 2022, said Nadella's speech provided executives with a framework for thriving.\n\n\"Satya was not giving us a pep talk, he was giving us an architecture for success,\" Snover wrote.\n\nIn a follow-up blog post, Snover wrote that project proposals were gathered ahead of the meeting, so it was the \"Lord of the Flies/Game of Thrones stage of resource allocation.\"\n\n\"Resource allocation isn't just about money; it's the most effective weapon for killing redundancy and enforcing architectural alignment,\" Snover wrote. \"If you can't afford to build your own silo, you finally start acting like a platform company.\"\n\nUnder Nadella, Microsoft's company culture shifted from being highly competitive toward an emphasis on teamwork, including implementing an evaluation system that rewarded collaboration.",

    "description": "Tech didn't just star in Super Bowl ads this year — it stumbled. While the stakes are high for advertisers, some glitches aren't always a bad thing.",
    "fullText": "A Super Bowl ad is meant to serve as a victory lap for tech companies. But on advertising's biggest night of the year, some brands were undone by the very thing they were supposed to be showcasing: technology.\n\nMr Beast and Salesforce teamed up to offer viewers a $1 million prize if they could be the first to crack clues hidden in a Super Bowl ad, and elsewhere, in an online treasure hunt. However, some hopeful contestants were immediately foiled by delays in receiving their registration emails.\n\nIn a message on the contest website, Salesforce said the glitch was caused by an \"overwhelming response\" to the competition and that it was working with major email providers to resolve the issue.\n\nMarc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, appeared to be pleased with the ad's performance, writing on X that more than 53 million people visited the campaign's landing page. \"Beyond any expectation we could have had,\" he wrote, adding that Mr Beast is \"an absolute genius.\"\n\nElsewhere, an ad that ran in the fourth quarter of the game for AI.com — a new platform launched by Crypto.com cofounder Kris Marszalek — invited viewers to visit the website to create a handle and create their own agents. But social media users said that the site was down for a period after the ad aired.\n\nMarszalek had spent $70 million to acquire the AI.com domain, which the deal's broker confirmed to the Financial Times was the highest-known price paid for a domain.\n\n\"Insane traffic levels. We prepared for scale, but not for THIS,\" Marszalek wrote on X. He later wrote that the site was \"hitting Google rate limits (which are at their absolute global maximum).\" The site was restored shortly afterward.\n\nThe stakes are high for Super Bowl advertisers. This year's broadcaster, NBCUniversal, confirmed that the average price to secure 30 seconds of airtime during the game reached $8 million, with some slots fetching $10 million. Then there's the additional investments in talent fees, production, and supporting ads and social activity beyond the TV ad.\n\nAs one of the few remaining mass-reach advertising vehicles — 127.7 million viewers tuned in last year, per the ratings company Nielsen — Super Bowl advertisers usually want to go out of their way to avoid mistakes. Sometimes brands can frame apparent tech flops as wins.\n\nLoz Horner, strategy partner at the ad agency Lucky Generals, which had previously produced Super Bowl campaigns for Amazon, said that while site crashes could cause some viewers to question the reliability of a company's tech, last night's glitches will likely play out well for Salesforce and AI.com.\n\n\"It builds the sense that this is a good thing that you should \"There probably isn't another advertising moment like the Super Bowl where if you run an ad saying, 'do something now,' you need to be ready for tens of millions of responses.\"\n\nIn 2022, Coinbase captured attention with a 60-second Super Bowl TV spot that simply featured a QR code bouncing around the screen like a DVD screensaver. Shortly after airing, Coinbase's app reportedly crashed for some users, while others showed error screens on the landing page. The company chalked it up as a win, saying the ad delivered 20 million hits to a landing page within a minute of it airing. The spot also won the 2022 Super Clio for best Super Bowl ad, an award judged by a jury of advertising experts.\n\nThis year, Coinbase went minimal again with a 60-second retro karaoke-machine-style ad that encouraged viewers to sing along to the Backstreet Boys' \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back),\" before revealing its logo at the very end.\n\nPrediction market platform Kalshi was another company hit by tech glitches during last night's Super Bowl. While the company couldn't advertise during the Super Bowl itself — prediction markets were placed on the NFL's prohibited advertising list last year — Kalshi had been heavily promoting bets related to the big game. However, the company said Sunday evening that some deposits and transfers on its app were delayed because of the high volume of traffic.",

The company lists its current clients as Aldi, Alexander Wang, and real estate firm Greystar.\n\nThe startup offers features such as real-time GPS tracking, enabling clients to ensure guards remain alert and on duty. By the end of the year, they want to automate 50% of a client's back-office workflow, like payroll, billing, and compliance.\n\nLong-term, the trio wants to add seamless integration with security cameras and an Uber-esque feature that would allow security guards to find local jobs and be reviewed on their performance.\n\nOverall, Kajikian sees an untapped market.\n\n\"Palantir is for the FBI and CIA, right?

    "fullText": "Ergonomic shape, quality materials and satisfying clicks, now with novel haptic feedback and repairable design\n\nLogitech’s latest productivity power-house updates one of the greatest mice of all time with smoother materials, a repair-friendly design and a haptic motor for phone-like vibrations on your desktop.\n\nThe MX Master 4 is the latest evolution in a line of pioneering mice that dates back more than 20 years and has long been the mouse to beat for everything but hardcore PC gaming. Having given it a magnetic free-spinning scroll wheel, plenty of buttons and precise tracking, now Logitech is trying something different for its seven-generation: the ability to tap back at you.\n\nThis level of innovation doesn’t come cheap. The MX Master 4 costs £119.99 (€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95), placing it firmly in the premium market alongside high-end gaming mice and expensive peripherals aimed at creative professionals.\n\nThe overall ergonomic shape of the mouse remains very similar to the previous outstanding versions from 2019 and 2022. It is finely balanced providing great grip, support to your palm and eight buttons all within easy reach – no stretching required – but it is only available for the right-hand.\n\nEverything about the mouse feels high quality and satisfying to use. After user feedback, the materials have since been updated to be harder wearing and easier to clean (no one likes a grubby mouse).\n\nThe button clicks feel strong but are virtually silent, which will please those around you. The best-in-class MagSpeed scroll wheel uses magnets to create a silent ratchet for line-byline movement, but flick it hard enough and the magnets disengage to allow it to spin freely like a flywheel so you can effortlessly shoot through documents or pages.\n\nThe thumb scroll wheel, back and forward buttons and the gesture button are better placed than previous iterations and are particularly useful for scrolling around in photography or design packages. Press the gesture button to switch between windows by default without having to reach for the keyboard.\n\nBelow this is the new haptic button. Press it to invoke Logitech’s “actions ring”, which is a circle of app-aware actions around your cursor you can quickly click without reaching for a menu or keyboard shortcut.\n\nThe haptic feedback is a click or tap similar to a modern laptop trackpad or the little vibrations from virtual buttons on your phone, first when depressed and again when you mouse over an on-screen button. The ring is customisable and provides rapid access to useful tools, such as volume and playback control, screenshots or AI tools on the desktop or the crop tool, layers or colour picker in apps such as Adobe’s Photoshop, Lightroom or Premiere Pro.\n\nThe haptics can also be used for certain actions outside of button presses. It can tap when your mouse moves from one display to another or gives feedback when you adjust sliders, snap to a grid or have finished exporting a clip in various Adobe apps.\n\nThe feedback shows a lot of promise but it relies on plugins for individual apps to be installed from the Logi Marketplace, of which there are just seven available at the moment, including for the Adobe creative suite or Zoom. If you use alternatives, such as the Affinity suite by Canva, you are out of luck.\n\nDimension: 128.2 x 88.4 x 50.8mm\n\nConnection: Bluetooth 5.1 or Logi Bolt USB\n\nSensor sensitivity: 200-8,000 DPI\n\nThe mouse connects to any Bluetooth device, so can work with computers, tablets, phones and other devices, but it can also use the Logi Bolt USB-C dongle for computers, which provides a more secure connection. The mouse can remember three devices at once, switching between them via button on the underside – handy for use with different computers or tablets.\n\nIt works on practically any surface, including glass, without the need for a mouse pad and the battery lasts about 70 days of typical use, charging via USB-C.\n\nIn a first for the line, the mouse is designed to be disassembled with exposed screws and has a battery that can be replaced at home with instructions, meaning this could be the last mouse you ever need.\n\nThe mouse’s basic functionality works without any additional software, but the actions ring, smart actions, AI, more advanced haptic feedback and many other productivity features require the free Logi Options+ app for macOS and Windows.\n\nThe software offers a lot of customisation and optional tools, and can be safely left to run in the background most of the time, but was recently subject to a complete failure. It has worked reliably with the MX Master 4, but occasionally has problems detecting other Logitech Bluetooth keyboards and is notorious for consuming computer resources unnecessarily.\n\nThe MX Master 4 is made from recycled plastic and cobalt. It can easily disassembled at home with standard exposed screws, including replacing the battery which costs £22.99.\n\nThe Logitech MX Master 4 costs £119.99 (€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95)\n\nFor comparison, the MX Master 3S costs £89.99, Keychron M6 costs £54.99 and the Razer Basilisk Mobile costs £89.99.\n\nThe MX Master 4 takes one of the best productivity mice, makes a bunch of refinements to make it even better, and adds the potentially gamechanging haptic feedback.\n\nUnfortunately, how much use you get out of the excellent haptic system relies entirely on plugins being available for the apps you use, which is great for the Adobe creative suite of apps, but not much more.\n\nThe Master 4 is super comfortable to use for extended periods, is quiet and has all the right buttons in the right places, including its best-in-class scroll wheel. Having Bluetooth and the Logi Bolt dongle makes it easy to use with several devices. The collection of useful additional productivity tools via the Logi Options+ app can speed up your workflow no end with a bit of power-user configuration.\n\nIt is an expensive, luxury mouse. But it is the best productivity mouse you can get and with a repairable design and a battery you can change at home, it may just be the last mouse you need.\n\nPros: super comfortable, excellent design and button placement, best-in-class scroll wheel, quiet, innovative haptics have potential, plenty of customisation options, serious productivity tools including the actions ring and smart actions\n\nCons: expensive, not many plugins available to support the haptics, Logi Options+ can be a resource hog, right-handed only.",

    "fullText": "Authors, a newsreader, a lawyer and an esteemed colleague: they’re all great – but I’m not married to any of them. Can we really depend on this technology?\n\nRecently, the Rowsons accidentally invented a new game that anyone can play at home. I have yet to come up with a world-beating name for it, so for now let’s just call it “How bloody stupid is AI?” The playing of the game will change from player to player, depending on their circumstances – but essentially the rules remain the same. Ask AI a simple question about yourself, and see just how wrong it gets it.\n\nIn my case, all you need know is that while I, through the nature of my job, have a fairly large online presence, my partner (we married in 1987) has assiduously avoided having one at all. Which means that if you Google “Martin Rowson wife” in images, you may get a picture of me next to our then 14-year-old daughter or me with my friend and fellow cartoonist Steven Appleby, who happens to be trans but has kept her given first name.\n\nIt’s probably incredibly reckless of me to say so, but I find this very funny. As a satirist, I have always been a fool for anything that points up the even greater folly of our leaders, the tools of their techbro masters or the true capabilities of our new robot overlords. Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",

    "title": "This Sci-Fi US Navy Destroyer Is $8 Billion Of Military Tech Floating At Sea",
    "description": "Right out of a sci-fi movie, this US Navy stealth ship comes with an $8 billion price tag and an incredible level of high-tech weaponry and capability.",
    "fullText": "When the U.S. Navy commissioned its Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000) in 2016, it hailed the warship as the most advanced surface combatant in the world. Equipped with a state-of-the-art stealth design, revolutionary electric propulsion and integrated power mechanisms, and twin Advanced Gun Systems, the 16,000-ton Zumwalt was touted as being larger, more advanced, and more difficult to detect than any destroyer the world had ever seen.\n\nHowever, several shortcomings, including runaway costs and underwhelming performance, caused the Navy to reduce order numbers from the proposed 32 to three, raising doubts in the Navy's ability to deliver advanced warships. Ultimately, the Zumwalt suffered from two major problems. The first was its incredible cost, as the $8 billion per-ship price tag made it impractical for largescale manufacturing and deployment. Second, its advanced designs were poorly suited for the Navy's intended usage as a land support ship, where stealth features are less important. As such, U.S. leadership determined the Zumwalt was an expensive square peg for the Navy's shore-support round hole, rendering it a floating money pit without a definitive mission.\n\nThis disconnect prompted the U.S. Navy to begin the arduous task of updating its most expensive destroyer, replacing the 155mm guns with hypersonic missiles. The first ship of its kind to sport an intercontinental missile system, the Zumwalt is one of a host of global destroyers adding high-tech weapons systems to address a changing threat landscape. The update recasts the Zumwalt as part of the U.S.'s long range strike operations, an increasingly important strategic priority, perhaps best exemplified by the nuclear missile test in November 2025. Having completed a round of post-modernization sea trials in January 2026, this sci-fi stealth ship may finally be ready to take its place at the head of U.S. Naval strategy.\n\nWhen the DDG-1000 was commissioned, it was lauded for its novel stealth designs. Despite constituting an approximate 40% jump in size from its Arleigh Burke-class predecessor, the 610-foot Zumwalt's radar cross section matches that of a 50-foot fishing vessel. Employing many of the same stealth design principles of fighter jets, the Zumwalt eschewed typical design structures, instead using an angular, wave-piercing tumblehome hull and a deckhouse constructed of electromagnetic wave-absorbing composite materials to lower the ship's radar footprint.\n\nAdd acoustics that more closely resemble a submarine, and the Zumwalt is roughly 50 times more clandestine than the Arleigh Burke destroyers. Another major development was the Zumwalt's electric propulsion system. Powered by a revolutionary integrated power network, it's capable of generating 78 megawatts, nearly as much as a nuclear aircraft carrier.\n\nThe massive size allows the Zumwalt to host a diverse array of aircraft, including Joint Strike Fighters, drones, and MV-22 Osprey, initially seen as a boon for its position alongside amphibious and littoral combat ships. To support these near-shore operations, the ship was equipped with two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS). With a range of 62 nautical miles, the Navy intended the AGS' Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles to fill the Naval Surface Fire Support void left by the 1992 retirement of the Iowa-class battleship.\n\nUnfortunately, the technological advancements of the Navy's sci-fi stealth ship came at a price. Over its 11-year development, costs skyrocketed to$23 billion. To put such astronomical numbers in perspective, the US Navy's new nuclear supercarrier, the Gerald R. Ford-class, costs $13 billion. Ammunition alone proved a financial disaster for the Zumwalt, as each round cost over $800,000, forcing a purchase cut from 20,000 to 2,400 units.\n\nFurther complicating things, the Zumwalt's expensive stealth advancements were ill-suited for the Navy's planned near-shore use, where crowded waterways and clear sightlines nullify much of its anti-radar capability. Between rising costs and competing design priorities, Naval planners largely viewed the Zumwalt-class destroyers as an expensive ship without a mission. Since canceling its ammunition order, however, the Navy has begun to reorient the Zumwalt away from close shore combat and towards clandestine operations and long range missile strikes.\n\nThis repurposing began in August 2023, when the DDG-1000 underwent a 3-year modernization effort.  Part of which involved replacing the Advanced Gun Systems with a state-of-the-art Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapons system that carries Common Hypersonic Glide Bodies capable of worldwide range at speeds up to Mach 5. Through these efforts, the Navy hopes that the CPS system will shift the Zumwalt-class destroyer into a key cog of its global force-projection efforts, particularly in the Pacific theatre.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

That's not politics, that's two different realities.\"\n\n\"It has four 'layers,' which I'll demonstrate through the lens of climate change:\n\n1) Factual reality – the declaration of absolute truths of being.Example: Carbon is a naturally occurring element on Earth, and it cycles between land, sea, and air as matter moves between those stages. Carbon in the atmosphere stores energy, which becomes thermal potential.\n\n2) Definition of facts – the framing of facts into a discrete 'event.'Example: Human industrial activity has released a large amount of previously captured carbon, meaning there's far more atmospheric carbon than would have organically ended up there through natural forces.\n\n3) Interpretation of facts – the declaration of quality on the established events.Example: Human industrial activity is threatening human safety by causing climate change that is detrimental to the long-term survival and sustainability of current lifestyles, which is bad because humans don't like dying.\n\n4) Response – the understanding of how these events pertain to us and our actions.Example: Humans need to make drastic changes to industrial activity to mitigate the climate impacts and attempt to repair existing damage.\n\nA person who doesn't believe anthropogenic carbon release exists (Layer 2) can't debate someone who believes industrial activity needs to be curbed (Layer 4), because the Layer 4 position is predicated on a Layer 2 presumption that isn't shared by both parties. The person making the Layer 4 argument is taking something for granted that the person making the Layer 2 argument doesn't, and so they fundamentally can never agree on a Layer 4 argument predicated on a Layer 2 prerequisite they don't agree with.\n\nTaking a moment to ascertain whether you're both on the same layer can be very helpful to diagnosing these situations where you feel like you're talking past each other.\"\n\nAlso in In the News: Gavin Newsom's New, Brutal Nickname For Trump Is Going Viral, And It May Be His Best One Yet\n\nAlso in In the News: \"The Male Loneliness Epidemic Is Entirely Self-Inflicted\": 24 Brutal, Brutal, Brutal Political Tweets Of The Week\n\nAlso in In the News: Gavin Newsom Came Up With A Nickname For JD Vance, And This One Is Definitely Going To Stick",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran sentenced Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to over seven more years in prison after she began a hunger strike, supporters said Sunday, as Tehran cracks down on all dissent following nationwide protests and the deaths of thousands at the hands of security forces.\n\nThe new convictions against Mohammadi come as Iran tries to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program to avert a threatened military strike by U.S. President Donald Trump. Iran's top diplomat insisted Sunday that Tehran's strength came from its ability to “say no to the great powers,\" striking a maximalist position just after negotiations in Oman with the U.S.\n\nMohammadi’s supporters cited her lawyer, who spoke to Mohammadi. The lawyer, Mostafa Nili, confirmed the sentence on X, saying it had been handed down Saturday by a Revolutionary Court in the city of Mashhad. Such courts typically issue verdicts with little or no opportunity for defendants to contest their charges.\n\n“She has been sentenced to six years in prison for ‘gathering and collusion’ and one and a half years for propaganda and two-year travel ban,” he wrote. She received another two years of internal exile to the city of Khosf, some 740 kilometers (460 miles) southeast of Tehran, the capital, the lawyer added.\n\nAgnes Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, wrote on X that Mohammadi's sentence was “a reflection of the skyrocketing lethal repression against dissent and protests waged by the authorities.”\n\nIran did not acknowledge the sentence. Supporters say Mohammadi has been on a hunger strike since Feb. 2 and ended it Sunday after her sentencing over her worsening health. She had been arrested in December at a ceremony honoring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate who had been based in Mashhad. Footage from the demonstration showed her shouting, demanding justice for Alikordi and others.\n\nMohammadi a symbol for Iranian activists\n\nSupporters had warned for months before her December arrest that Mohammadi, 53, was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns.\n\nWhile that was to be only three weeks, Mohammadi’s time out of prison lengthened, possibly as activists and Western powers pushed Iran to keep her free. She remained out even during the 12-day war in June between Iran and Israel.\n\nMohammadi still kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including even demonstrating at one point in front of Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where she had been held.\n\nMohammadi had been serving 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran’s government. She also had backed the nationwide protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab.\n\nMohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. Her lawyer in late 2024 revealed doctors had found a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous that later was removed.\n\n“Considering her illnesses, it is expected that she will be temporarily released on bail so that she can receive treatment,” Nili wrote.\n\nHowever, Iranian officials have been signaling a harder line against all dissent since the demonstrations. Speaking on Sunday, Iranian judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei made comments suggesting harsh prison sentences awaited many.\n\n“Look at some individuals who once were with the revolution and accompanied the revolution,\" he said. \"Today, what they are saying, what they are writing, what statements they issue, they are unfortunate, they are forlorn (and) they will face damage.”\n\nForeign minister strikes hard-line tone\n\nThe news about Mohammadi came as Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking to diplomats at a summit in Tehran, signaled that Iran would stick to its position that it must be able to enrich uranium — a major point of contention with Trump, who bombed Iranian atomic sites in June during the 12-day Iran-Israel war.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to travel to Washington this week, with Iran expected to be the major subject of discussion, his office said.\n\nWhile Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian praised the talks Friday in Oman with the Americans as “a step forward,” Araghchi's remarks show the challenge ahead. Already, the U.S. moved the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, ships and warplanes to the Middle East to pressure Iran into an agreement and have the firepower necessary to strike the Islamic Republic should Trump choose to do so.\n\n“I believe the secret of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s power lies in its ability to stand against bullying, domination and pressures from others,\" Araghchi said. \"They fear our atomic bomb, while we are not pursuing an atomic bomb. Our atomic bomb is the power to say no to the great powers. The secret of the Islamic Republic’s power is in the power to say no to the powers.”\n\n‘Atomic bomb’ as rhetorical device\n\nAraghchi's choice to explicitly use an “atomic bomb” as a rhetorical device likely wasn't accidental. While Iran has long maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, the West and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Tehran had an organized military program to seek the bomb up until 2003.\n\nIran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%, the only nonweapons state to do so. Iranian officials in recent years had also been increasingly threatening that the Islamic Republic could seek the bomb, even while its diplomats have pointed to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s preachings as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran wouldn’t build one.\n\nIt remains unclear when and where, or if, there will be a second round of nuclear talks. Trump, after the talks Friday, offered few details but said: “Iran looks like they want to make a deal very badly — as they should.”\n\nMeanwhile, Iran issued a warning to pilots it planned “rocket launches” Monday into Tuesday in an area over the country's Semnan province, home to the Imam Khomeini Spaceport. Such launches have corresponded in the past with Iran marking the anniversary of its 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

    "description": "India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra argued ​it would benefit only one company, a government document shows.\n\nA September draft had proposed leniency ‌for petrol cars weighing 909 kg (2,004 lb) or less - a carve-out widely seen as favouring Maruti Suzuki, which controls 95% of ‌India's small‑car market.\n\nIndia's Power Ministry has now removed that exemption and tightened other parameters, increasing pressure on all automakers to ramp up electric and hybrid car sales, according to the latest 41-page draft reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe new rules curb over-compensation for vehicle weight, aim to level the field between light and heavy fleet ⁠manufacturers, and are designed to deliver ‌real-world efficiency gains, the document said.\n\nThey introduce \"a substantially steeper reduction pathway\" for emissions, it added.\n\nThe power ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPROMOTING ELECTRIC, HYBRID ‍MODELS\n\nTransport accounts for about 12% of India's energy use and is a major driver of petroleum imports and carbon emissions. Passenger vehicles make up nearly 90% of transport-related emissions, the document says.\n\nCorporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms dictate permissible ​CO2 emissions across a manufacturer's fleet of passenger cars weighing less than 3,500 kg (7,716 lb). Updated ‌every five years, they push automakers towards cleaner technologies including electrification, compressed natural gas and flex-fuel.\n\nThe new rules will apply from April 2027 for five years and are central to automakers' product and powertrain investment plans. It was not immediately clear when the rules will be finalised.\n\nThe September draft would have allowed fuel-consumption targets to rise faster with vehicle weight, easing compliance for makers of heavier cars such as ⁠Mahindra, Tata and Volkswagen, while tightening demands on lighter-fleet players ​such as Maruti. That imbalance prompted the carve-out.\n\nThe revised plan ​reduces the extent to which heavier vehicles gain more relaxed targets.\n\n\"Manufacturers with heavier fleets ... are required to achieve stronger intrinsic efficiency improvements,\" the document said.\n\nA credit system will ‍reward companies that sell more ⁠EVs and plug-in hybrids, and pooling of fuel-consumption performance between companies will be allowed. Non-compliance will draw penalties of up to $550 per car.\n\nThe revised plan aims to cut average fleet emissions ⁠to about 100 grams/km over the five years to March 2032 from 114 grams/km. With credits, that could fall to ‌as low as 76 grams/km if electric models reach 11% of total car sales ‌by 2032.",

    "description": "Somali president promises to confront Israeli military presence amid reports of base plan in breakaway Somaliland.",
    "fullText": "Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has slammed Israel’s “interference” in his country, saying its recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland has further increased instability and weakened international order.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera broadcast on Saturday, Mohamud said Somalia “will never allow” the establishment of an Israeli base in Somaliland and will “confront” any such move.\n\nHe also warned that the proposed Israeli base could be used as a springboard to attack neighbouring countries.\n\nMohamud’s comments came amid a regional outcry over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision in December to recognise Somaliland, a breakaway part of Somalia comprising the northwestern portion of what was once the British Protectorate.\n\nThe territory sits astride one of the world’s most critical maritime choke routes, flanked by multiple conflicts in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIsrael’s move made it the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland as an independent state and came months after The Associated Press news agency reported that Israeli officials had contacted parties in Somaliland to discuss using the territory for forcibly displacing Palestinians amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nIsrael and Somaliland have denied the claims, but a Somaliland official from the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation told Israel’s Channel 12 in January that an Israeli military base is “on the table and being discussed”, though its establishment depends on the terms.\n\nSomalia has denounced Israel’s move as an attack on its territorial integrity and unity, a position backed by most African and Arab leaders, and urged Netanyahu to withdraw the recognition.\n\nBut Somaliland’s leader, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as Cirro, has welcomed Israel’s diplomatic move, praising Netanyahu for his “leadership and commitment to promoting stability and peace” in the region.\n\nIn his interview with Al Jazeera, Mohamud described Israel’s diplomatic manoeuvre as a “reckless, fundamentally wrong and illegal action under international law”.\n\nHe also pledged to fight back against any Israeli military presence in Somaliland.\n\n“We will fight in our capacity. Of course, we will defend ourselves,” he said. “And that means that we will confront any Israeli forces coming in, because we are against that and we will never allow that.”\n\nThe Israeli recognition represents a dramatic shift in Somaliland’s fortunes after years of diplomatic isolation.\n\nThe region seceded from Somalia during a brutal civil war that followed decades under the hardline government of Siad Barre, whose forces devastated the north. While large parts of Somalia descended into chaos, Somaliland stabilised by the late 1990s.\n\nSomaliland has since developed a distinct political identity, with its own currency, flag and parliament. But its eastern regions remain disputed by communities that do not back the separatist programme in the capital, Hargeisa.\n\nIn recent years, Somaliland developed ties with the United Arab Emirates – a signatory to the Abraham Accords with Israel – and Taiwan as it sought international acceptance.\n\nIn his interview, Mohamud said Israel’s move “interfering with Somalia’s sovereign and territorial integrity” also “undermines stability, security and trade in a way that affects the whole of Africa, the Red Sea and the wider world”.\n\nHe added that Israel’s deadly use of force against Palestinians in Gaza cannot be separated from what is happening in Somaliland, adding that it reflects the weakening of the foundations of global governance.\n\n“Key among the global concerns is the weakening of the established rules-based international order. That order is not intact any more,” Mohamud said.\n\nHe warned that institutions created after World War II “are under grave threat”, as “the mighty is right” increasingly replaces adherence to international law.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, has yet to signal a major shift on the question of Somaliland.\n\nBut in August, US President Donald Trump – who has previously lobbed insults at Somalia and Mohamud – suggested he was preparing to move on the issue when asked about Somaliland during a White House news conference.\n\n“Another complex one, but we’re working on that one – Somaliland,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Team GB skier Gus Kenworthy says he has received death threats after posting a graphic message about the United States' Immigration and Customs Enforcement organisation - commonly known as ICE.\n\nKenworthy shared the image - in which 'ICE' was preceded by an expletive - on Instagram a week before he was due to compete at the Winter Olympics in Italy.\n\nThe 34-year-old was born in Chelmsford but grew up in America and won silver in the ski slopestyle at the Sochi 2014 Games, before switching allegiance to Team GB in 2019.\n\nIn a new post on Instagram, Kenworthy said there had been a lot of \"encouraging\" support but that he has also received death threats.\n\n\"The other day I posted a photo with my thoughts on ICE and that photo has since gone everywhere - and I've gotten a tonne of messages and most of them honestly have been supportive and encouraging,\" Kenworthy said in a video., external\n\n\"But a lot of the messages have been awful, people telling me to kill myself, threatening me, wishing they'll get to see me blow my knee or break my neck during my event, calling me slurs... it's insane.\"\n\nThe British Olympic Association (BOA) told BBC Sport: \"Team GB takes athlete welfare seriously and has support services in place for athletes, including specifically where there are threats and abuse via social media. All Team GB athletes are offered this on a proactive basis.\"\n\nKenworthy will feature in the men's snowboard halfpipe event, with qualifying beginning on 19 February in Livigno, Italy.\n\nProtests have taken place across the US over the past few weeks after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, 37, and fellow Minnesota resident Renee Good, 37, were both killed by ICE agents in the city in January.\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nGB's Brookes & Muir target medals, plus curling semi-final - Monday's guide\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nTeam USA skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess have also spoken out at the Games about the actions of ICE and ongoing tensions in the US.\n\nLillis said he was \"heartbroken\" and wants to country to \"respect everybody's rights\", while treating all citizens with \"love and respect\".\n\nAsked what it means to represent the USA, Hess said: \"It's a little hard. There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't.\n\n\"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nIOC spokesman Mark Adams said: \"I'm not going to add to the discourse.\n\n\"We have a good relationship with the USOPC and the administration, that can only be good for debate and delivering a good Games.\"\n\nThe BOA and IOC said Kenworthy would not be punished for his initial post on Instagram when he appeared to urinate the ICE-related message into the snow.\n\nBOA chief Dame Katherine Grainger said he had the right to express himself.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) is using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to monitor social media for abusive posts directed at athletes at the Winter Games.\n\nThe system was first deployed at the 2022 Paris Olympics and flagged 2.4 million posts from 20,000 social media accounts in more than 35 languages.\n\n\"Maybe that's the price you pay for speaking up and using your platform but I think it's important to say what you feel and stand up for justice,\" Kenworthy said.\n\n\"You can love the US and be proud to be an American and still think it can be better and that the country can improve.\"\n\nChief Games operations officer Andrea Francisi said they are not planning to bring in \"additional measures\" of security around athletes.\n\n\"We attach a lot of attention to all these events, but there are not situations which require us to take additional measures,\" Francisi said.\n\n\"Things are stable, we do not need additional measures. There is a fantastic, calm atmosphere in the villages, we do not need a plan here.\"\n\nThe US said it would send ICE agents to the Games to help support American security operations, prompting anger from the Italian foreign office and citizens.\n\nUS vice-president JD Vance was in Milan for Friday's opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium, where he and wife Usha were roundly booed by the crowd when they appeared on big screens at the arena.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Derick Hall doesn't just feel blessed to be a Super Bowl champion. He feels blessed to be alive after being born with a 1% chance of survival.\n\nThe Seattle linebacker played a key role as the Seahawks beat the New England Patriots 29-13 in Sunday's NFL title decider, claiming two sacks in a dominant defensive display.\n\nBut it is a wonder the 24-year-old is even here at all after being born four months premature in 2001.\n\nHall weighed less than 3lb and was on life support when his mother refused to have it discontinued.\n\nNow 6ft 3in and 254lb, he hugged his mother on the field in Santa Clara, California, after Seattle's second Super Bowl win.\n\n\"Everyone knows my story, what it took for me to get here, what it took for me just to be alive and have the chance,\" said Hall.\n\n\"I'm very blessed - kudos to Mom. That was a special moment after the game. I feel like she's an unsung hero, an unsung warrior through this whole process. She always fought for me. She never gave up.\n\n\"Just being able to play football and what this game has done for me and my life and my family...\n\n\"I always love and respect playing this game, and I feel like I show that every single time I step on the field.\"\n\nAfter a difficult start to his NFL career, it seemed Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold was destined to become a journeyman back-up.\n\nBut after leading the Minnesota Vikings to last season's play-offs, the Seahawks became his fifth team in eight years - and third in three – and they have won American sport's biggest prize in his first season in Seattle.\n\n\"My team-mates and my coaches, they believed in me since the first training camp, every single day we came to work,\" said 28-year-old Darnold.\n\n\"I shared a great moment with my parents and fiancee Katie after the game and I think that's what kind of got me a little bit. I told my dad and my mom, I'm here because of their belief in me.\n\n\"Some people called me crazy throughout my career for believing in myself so much, but it was because of my parents. It allowed me to go out there and play free and have a ton of confidence.\n\n\"On offence, I feel like we didn't play as good as we could have. I certainly didn't, but our defence and special teams had our back.\"\n\nSeattle also signed Cooper Kupp in the off-season and he claimed his second Super Bowl win, having been the Most Valuable Player (MVP) when the Los Angeles Rams became NFL champions in 2022.\n\n\"My wife was the first person to believe in me,\" said the wide receiver. \"She's believed that this story was written so long ago.\n\n\"I would like to say I was all in and believed it as well, but there were some tough times. Anna has believed that this is what we came to Seattle to do.\n\n\"It's an unbelievable story. To be in this place, it's hallowed ground.\"\n\nSeattle defensive coordinator Aden Durde became the first overseas coach to win a Super Bowl, after beginning his coaching journey in the British amateur game.\n\nThe 46-year-old said he felt the Seahawks were going to win \"from down one\", adding: \"We put a plan together and the guys executed at an elite level.\n\n\"I'm very grateful. A lot of people sacrificed a lot for me to be sitting here, but you don't see that.\n\n\"My mum and brother watched the game at an NFL party, and when my sons and wife came on to the field they showed me a picture of them watching, so that was pretty cool.\"\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump reacted forcefully to Super Bowl 60, calling for immediate change after what he described as a damaging moment for the NFL.\n\nFollowing the game, the former US president focused his criticism on the halftime show and quickly expanded his comments to include league policy.\n\nTrump shared his reaction in a post published by TrumpTruthOnX, responding directly to Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.\n\nHe wrote, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, ever! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence.\n\n“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children who are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”\n\nThe comments were uncompromising and immediate. Trump framed the halftime show not as a matter of taste, but as a failure to reflect what he believes the Super Bowl should represent.\n\nAs has often been the case, Trump’s reaction quickly spread across social media, becoming part of the wider debate surrounding the NFL’s entertainment choices.\n\nTrump’s post did not stop at the halftime show. He also used the moment to call out a specific NFL rule change.\n\nHe continued, “This ‘show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the best Stock Market and 401(k)s in history!\n\n“There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a halftime show and watch, it will get great reviews from the fake news media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the real world, and, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new kickoff rule. Make America great again!”\n\nThe mention of the kickoff rule stood out. Rather than limiting his response to entertainment, Trump shifted attention to on-field changes introduced by the league.\n\nHis criticism suggested frustration with what he sees as unnecessary adjustments to the game itself.\n\nThe NFL’s revised kickoff rule, which was introduced in 2024, has already divided fans, with some praising the improvements and others arguing it removes excitement.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 fallout continues, the former president’s comments ensured the halftime show debate expanded beyond music.\n\nIt became, once again, a flashpoint for how sport, culture, and politics intersect on the biggest stage.\n\nDonald Trump goes off on ‘worst ever’ Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show\n\nImane Khelif has a brutal reminder for Donald Trump, names only way she will ‘respect’ the US President\n\nWho Donald Trump picked as Super Bowl LX winners between Patriots and Seahawks",

    "fullText": "Barcelona presidential elections: Who are the 2026 candidates, and why the role of president matters originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs one of the only member-owned major clubs left in Europe, Barcelona will take a major step towards defining the future of the institution over the next two months.\n\nOn March 15, Barcelona \"socios\" will elect the next club president who will lead Barcelona into the next era of European and global football. Until then, we'll have six weeks of campaigning, in which time candidates must drum up sufficient support.\n\nRequired by the club's bylaws to hold elections every five years, the current mandate of president Joan Laporta is set to expire, and he has called for new elections for himself and the board to be held in March. That means the incumbents must resign their positions on Monday, February 9.\n\nThe Sporting News explains why this is happening, who the candidates for election could be, and what each one stands for as the Barcelona faithful aim to decide the best leader for the next phase of the club's illustrious history.\n\nMORE:Who owns Barcelona? Explaining the \"socio\" model and how to become one\n\nThe duties of the president of Barcelona are wide-ranging. The individual is responsible for overseeing players and coaches signing contracts, managing the finances of the club, chairing General Assembly meetings, and much more.\n\nIn essence, the president runs the day-to-day operations of the club while serving as the public face of the team and Barcelona brand. Barca's executives, such as the sporting director, report to the president.\n\nFrom 2026 onwards, presidential terms at Barcelona will be five years in length, at which point elections must be held for both president and all board members. Laporta's current term will be the last to run for six years. According to Mundo Deportivo, Laporta said \"sometimes, six years is just too long\" during his campaign for election in 2021.\n\nLaporta has scheduled the presidential election for Barcelona for March 15, 2026.\n\nAs per club statutes, Laporta has stated that he will resign from his position at the General Assembly on Monday, February 9, along with a significant number of the board. Starting then, candidates for election will go about gathering signatures, as they require at least 2,321 socios to support their candidacy to officially stand for election.\n\nFrom then until the election, a regency will take charge of the club. A number of board members — at least six, or one third of the total board — are likely to remain in position to avoid necessitating the formation of a temporary management committee.\n\nChallengers to Laporta have criticized the decision to hold elections midseason, stating that the timeline \"suits Laporta\" but does not do the club the service of a fully fair and balanced election process.\n\nCandidates for Barcelona president must have been a socio for at least 10 years, and must gather at least 2,321 socio signatures backing their candidacy.\n\nPresidential candidates are also required to, together with their executive board, present a \"financial guarantee\" worth 15 percent of the club's budget. Barcelona's club statutes state that the executive board is \"liable for their actions\" while in office, and thus the guarantee is a means of backing that claim financially, with the aim to protect against poor governance and mismanagement.\n\nWhile this process plays out, candidates for election will not be finalized until they present both the signatures and financial backing to solidify their candidacy. This process will not conclude until closer to the date of the election, and thus this list of candidates is, for now, simply a list of \"pre-candidates\".\n\nThe sitting president of Barcelona is Joan Laporta. He has been in office since being elected in 2021, taking over for Josep Bartomeu, who had resigned in 2020 amid widespread anger at the club's management, specifically the dire financial situation and Bartomeu's public spat with Lionel Messi.\n\nLaporta is currently in his second stint as president of the club. He was first elected in 2003 and spent seven years at the helm, during which he saw the rise of Messi and the hiring of Pep Guardiola.\n\nAfter a decade spent in Catalan politics, Laporta returned to Barcelona with his election in 2021, where he has since been tasked with stabilising the club's finances after the emergency situation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and years of financial mismanagement under Bartomeu.\n\nUnder Laporta's leadership, Barcelona are through the most immediate danger brought about by their money struggles, when it seemed shockingly plausible that they could cease to exist entirely, but they are still significantly in debt.\n\nThe club is believed to owe around €1.5 billion ($1.8bn), thanks in part to the massive renovation project to update their stadium, Camp Nou. The club is banking on revenue from the improved venue to rectify the situation in the long term, but for now, they are still under considerable financial strain.\n\nAccording to Barcelona's treasurer in January of 2026, the club still has liabilities of around €2.5bn ($3bn), with the New York Times describing Laporta's strategy as \"spending its way out of crisis.\"\n\nThe Camp Nou renovation is Laporta's crown jewel, and he has platformed on the goal of hosting the 2029 UEFA Champions League final at the newly overhauled stadium. Unfortunately, the renovation process has not been smooth and has been saddled with financial overreaches, significant delays, and other bad press including water leaks.\n\nVictor Font, 53, is making a second run at the Barcelona presidency, and is considered the most serious challenger to the incumbent. He lost to Laporta in the 2021 election to replace Bartomeu, receiving 30 percent of the vote to Laporta's 54.3 percent.\n\nFont is the co-founder of Delta Partners, a financial tech consulting firm, and has deep roots in Catalan football. He is a part-owner of Catalan publication Ara and also of football analytics company Kognia Sports Intelligence.\n\nFont's main platform is a pullback on Laporta's aggressive financial tactics. He has criticized Laporta's use of \"levers\" to achieve short-term financial solvency at the cost of leveraging the club's future earnings. Critics of his economic plan believe that it will harm Barcelona's ability to compete now, which could damage the club's image and trajectory.\n\nFont has also platformed on reducing the presidential term to four years alongside other reforms such as overhauling the requirements to run for a position on the board. He also wishes to create a ticket package tailored to socios who are not season-ticket holders, and he is promoting an expanded voting system that incentivises mail-in and electronic voting for long-distance members.\n\nPerhaps Font's most publicized campaign promise is that he wishes to make every possible effort to bring Messi back to Barcelona to finish his career where it began.\n\nXavier Vilajoana, also 53, is the CEO of Grup Euroconstruc, a development company specializing in affordable housing and sustainable construction. He attempted to run in the 2021 election but could not earn the requisite number of socio signatures.\n\nVilajoana was once, in his youth, a member of the famed La Masia academy, and went on to captain Barcelona's futsal team. He has been heavily involved in Barcelona's executive setup since then, and was on the board during Bartomeu's presidency.\n\nGiven his efforts within the club, Vilajoana has attempted to take credit for a lot of the club's current success on the pitch, pointing to the successful current youth product. He is concurrently saying that Laporta's claims to their recent run of results under Hansi Flick should not be attributed to the sitting president, but instead the years of groundwork laid by previous regimes to which Vilajoana was a key contributor.\n\nWhile Vilajoana's knowledge of the club's history, background, and inner workings is clear, his ties to a disgraced Bartomeu will likely work against him in any bid for the presidency, even if he has tried to distance himself from that time.\n\nThe final presidential candidate is sports economist and financier Marc Ciria.\n\nCiria has taken Font's promise to bring Messi back to Barcelona one step further, not only claiming he will pursue it with reckless abandon, but calling such a move \"strategic... for the future of the club and to protect and preserve the ownership model.\" Ciria pointed to the club's current revenue, which he says is below expectations when comparing it to Messi's time at the club, as proof that the Blaugrana legend is \"essential\" to the club's health.\n\nDubbed \"Movement 42,\" Ciria's plan centers around massive restructuring of the club's financial setup. \"When things aren't working, you have to change them, you have to start over,\" Ciria says.",

I think they'll definitely be looking over their shoulders.\"\n\nCaptain Cristian Romero was sent off in the first half at Old Trafford for a late lunge on Casemiro, his sixth dismissal in a Spurs shirt.\n\n\"I can see why it's been given but I think it's a little bit harsh,\" said Rooney.\n\n\"Sometimes you lose your head at times. And I think he's done that throughout his time at Tottenham.\"\n\nIt came days after Romero's social media post which seemed to criticise the people who run the club - when he said it was \"disgraceful\" they only had 11 fit players for a 2-2 draw with Manchester City.\n\n\"What doesn't help is comments in the week before about the lack of players Tottenham have,\" added Rooney.\n\n\"He clearly speaks his mind as well. But unfortunately, you've got to go and back that up with performances when you're vocal like that - and I don't think he's done that. All that's going to do is bring more pressure on Thomas Frank.\"\n\nRooney has sympathy for Frank, who managed Brentford for seven years before moving across London last summer to replace Postecoglou.\n\n\"I feel for Thomas Frank because he looks tired, he looks like he's aged 10 years,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what that Tottenham job has done to him in a short period of time. I hope they stick with him because he's fantastic manager, but I think it's going be very difficult for them to do that.\n\n\"And you don't need your captain going out getting sent off on a regular basis or being as vocal as he was this week.\"\n\nWatch The Wayne Rooney Show on BBC iPlayer or listen on BBC Sounds.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "How ‘Walking Hall of Famer’ Devon Witherspoon put his stamp on Super Bowl win",
    "description": "Devon Witherspoon’s teammate called him a future Hall of Famer after his game-changing performance in the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory.",
    "fullText": "There was a moment after Uchenna Nwosu crossed the goal line to score a decisive touchdown late in the Super Bowl when Devon Witherspoon had a strong case for the game’s Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe box score momentarily read that Witherspoon had just notched his second sack and forced a fumble that fell into Nwosu’s arms. Nwosu ran 45 yards and scored, making it a 29-7 game, effectively ending the New England Patriots’ slim hopes at a miracle comeback.\n\nBut the box score was corrected by NFL officials moments later, giving Nwosu the interception and taking away a sack and forced fumble from Witherspoon’s stat line. Had it held, his MVP case might have been stronger than running back Kenneth Walker, who had 161 yards from scrimmage, but wasn’t part of any touchdown plays, as Witherspoon was.\n\nAfter all, the story of Sunday’s 29-13 championship triumph from the Seahawks was the defense’s domination of second-year quarterback Drake Maye. And Witherspoon’s stat line would have jumped out over Derick Hall and Byron Murphy, who each had two sacks. Maye was sacked six times, finished with a fumble and two interceptions while the Seahawks won the turnover battle 3-0.\n\nNot that anyone with the Seahawks mind that Walker won MVP. Lifting of the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in the organization’s history, the hugs, celebratory cigars and the other once-in-a-lifetime moments at Levi’s Stadium mean far more than quibbles over box score stats and MVP cases.\n\nBut there’s little doubt Witherspoon has cemented himself as one of the best defensive backs in the NFL — and has a chance to go down as an all-time Seahawks player if he continues his current trajectory.\n\n“He’s a walking Hall of Famer, right now,” Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV said. “He’s a dog. He’s my favorite player in the NFL. He can do everything.”\n\nWitherspoon had four tackles, a sack, and three quarterbacks hits, including the one on Maye that led to Nwosu’s touchdown. His sack in the first quarter ended New England’s second drive in a string that included 10 straight possessions that ended in either a punt or kneel down to end the first half.\n\nHis performance in the Super Bowl will get added to a resume that already includes three Pro Bowls in his first three seasons, and potentially a contract atop the market. The No. 5-overall pick in the 2023 draft is eligible for an extension for the first time this offseason.\n\n“The soul of our defense, ‘Spoon is the heart of it,” safety Julian Love said. “If you know football and you watch our tape, 21 jumps off the screen every single play, every single game, every single rep. It’s just raw talent. It’s playing football the right way. He’s just a ballplayer. And he’s been that way since the first time he stepped in the building.”\n\nThe Patriots didn’t score a touchdown until early in the fourth quarter, trimming a 19-0 to 19-7. Witherspoon, and his teammates, throttled New England to the tune of 78 yards on offense through the first three quarters. They exploded for 253 in the fourth when the game was largely out of hand to finish with a respectable 331. The final number did not represent how much Seattle’s “Dark Side” controlled the game.\n\nWhen relayed being called a Hall of Famer by Jones, Witherspoon said, “It means everything. Talk about a great teammate, Ernest, he’s everything to us, man. A ‘Mike’ linebacker who sets the standard for us. ... Right now, I’m just focused on the now, living in the present.”\n\nSeahawks coach Mike Macdonald dialed up more blitzes early in the game than the Seahawks typically had throughout the season. He called nine pressures, by unofficial count, in the first half. That 36% rate is nearly double their 19.3% rate from the regular season, according to Pro Football Reference.\n\nOf course, Witherspoon’s blitzes resulted in his first-quarter sack that came on an early third down that helped set the tone of the game. And his hit on Maye that led to Nwosu’s touchdown will be remembered as a highpoint in the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory.\n\n“I haven’t been blitzing a lot this year,” Witherspoon said. “But it was best for our team, and I’m going to do whatever I need to do for our team to win.”",

    "fullText": "K League sides in continental competition will take to the field for their first competitive matches of 2026 in midweek, looking to shake off any rust and continue their pursuits of 2025-2026 AFC Champions League glory.\n\nVissel Kobe (1st, JPN) vs. FC Seoul (5th) - 19:00 KST\n\nFC Seoul will play their first competitive match of 2026 away to AFC Champions League Elite leaders Vissel Kobe, as the continent's premier club competition resumes for Match Day 7. Seoul had been in decent form before the winter break, earning five points from their last three ACLE outings, the last being a 1-1 draw with Melbourne City. Vissel Kobe, meanwhile, were able to preserve their place in first with a 2-2 draw at home to Chengdu Rongcheng, making it three unbeaten following wins over Ulsan and Shanghai Shenhua. Kobe got their domestic campaign up and running on Friday in the J1 100 Year Vision League, away to Kyoto Sanga, drawing 1-1 then winning 4-1 on penalties.\n\nKobe's clash with Ulsan was one of two against K League opposition in the 2025-2026 edition of the competition, the other being a thrilling 4-3 loss away to Gangwon. Seoul, meanwhile, have faced J.League opposition just once so far this campaign, earning a 1-1 draw away to Machida Zelvia last September. Kobe will be a tough nut to crack for Seoul, with the J1 League champions leading the way for clean sheets with four and having shown their attacking prowess with the second-most touches in the box and the best shot conversion rate in the competition of 18.8%. Seoul, meanwhile, rank first for accurate passes per match, so will be expected to have lots of possession of the ball, despite being the away side, and rank fourth for big chances created.\n\nSeoul will have to be wary of Yoshinori Muto, Kobe's goal scorer on Friday, who ranks second for shots on target per 90 with 2.7, ranks first for successful dribbles (75%), and has two goals and one assist to his name in the ACL. The capital club will be looking to new recruit Song Min-kyu to fill Jesse Lingard's shoes. Song has featured in AFC club competitions 18 times, scoring five and assisting one.\n\nGangwon FC (9th) vs. Shanghai Port (12th, CHN) - 19:00 KST\n\nGangwon FC got off to a great start in their debut ACL season, but form tailed off towards the end of 2025, and now the Bears sit outside the qualification group. Jeong Kyung-ho's men are ninth, but just a point behind Johor Darul Ta'zim, Buriram United, and Ulsan, and face basement side Shanghai Port next. The Chinese Super League giants have managed to pick up just two points from their first six ACLE matches, owing to draws with Sanfrecce Hiroshima and JDT. They also lost 3-1 to FC Seoul in what is so far their only clash with a K League side this campaign.\n\nGangwon's continental bow brought a 2-1 home win over Port's city neighbours Shanghai Shenhua, but was followed up by a 1-0 loss away to Chengdu Rongcheng. Gangwon will look to control the game with the lion's share of possession, having racked up the highest so far among teams in the East side of the competition with 59.9%, but will be looking to get more shots on target, ranking ninth in that regard. Shanghai Port are the reigning Chinese Super League champions and were not among the teams deducted points for match fixing. Although unlikely, qualification to the Round of 16 is still mathematically possible, but it would take two wins from their last two games, and for results elsewhere to go their way.\n\nKim Dae-won will be Gangwon's player to watch, creating 3.1 chances per 90 on average and 13 overall as the Bears' best in that regard and the best among players in the East side of the competition. But if Gangwon can create chances, they'll need to find a way past Port goalkeeper Wei Chen, who ranks third for save percentage (81.8%) and first for saves per 90 with 6.8.\n\nUlsan HD (8th) vs. Melbourne City (4th, AUS) - 19:00 KST\n\nUlsan HD begin life under new manager Kim Hyun-seok with the visit of A-League Men side Melbourne City. They do so sitting just inside the qualification group for the Round of 16, but will need to start picking up wins if they are to reach the knockouts. The Horangi lost 3-1 away to Machida Zelvia in their last ACL outing, and are on a run of three without a win. City, meanwhile, sit fourth having put together a run of four matches unbeaten with three victories. Their most recent outing was a very credible 1-1 draw away to FC Seoul. Domestically, Melbourne City are seventh in the table following five wins, seven draws and five losses, with just two wins in their last six, however. On Saturday, City played out a 1-1 draw with Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\nUlsan rank fifth for shots on target per match with 4.8, but will need to improve their conversion rate which stands at just 7.8%. The Horangi have also found it hard to create meaningful chances, ranking seventh for big chances with 12 and just five goals scored. City have been clinical with seven goals scored from 10 big chances, but 2.5 shots on target per match might not be sustainable. If Ulsan can defend well against their A-League counterparts, they could emerge with all three points.\n\nDarijan Bojanic will be key to Ulsan again this season and indeed this Wednesday. The Swede is first for accurate passes per 90 at 68.9, while Max Caputo, despite being on the bench against Wanderers at the weekend, is City's top scorer domestically with six and has two goals in ACLE thus far. It'll be the first-ever meeting between the two teams, but Ulsan have a record of nine wins, three draws and three losses versus Australian opposition, and are unbeaten in their last nine, while City have two wins and one draw from just three meetings.\n\nPohang Steelers vs. Gamba Osaka (JPN) - 19:00\n\nIn AFC Champions League Two, Pohang Steelers host Gamba Osaka on Thursday in the first leg of their Round of 16 tie. Pohang won four of their six Group H matches, losing just one but face a Gamba Osaka side that won all six of their Group F matches, keeping four clean sheets and conceding just two goals. Gamba finished ninth in the J1 last season and managed just five away wins from 19 matches. They began the new domestic campaign with a 0-0 draw in the Osaka derby, but won 5-4 on penalties, in what turned out to be a 10 vs. 10 affair with Takeru Kishimoto sent off on 84 minutes and Hayato Tanaka for Cerezo.\n\nThursday's contest might prove to be a tight affair with both teams boasting solid defenses, conceding just two goals each so far. Pohang have racked up the most possession so far with 69.7%, while Gamba rank third in that regard with 68.6%, having both played against teams that defended in low blocks. Pohang rank third for shots on target per match with 6.5, while Gamba are the competition's best passers wth 581.2 accurate passes per match.\n\nPohang faced Gamba in the 2012 ACL group stage, earning two wins - 2-0 at home and 3-0 away. Gamba have a record of eight wins, six draws and 11 losses against K League opposition over the years, with the most recent meetings being against Jeonbuk in 2021. In Korea, Gamba's record reads three wins, three draws, and five losses.",

When Allen died, the executor and trustee of the trust became the team's owner, and that was Jody Allen.\n\nJody Allen is the sister of former Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who died in 2018. Jody was named the executor and trustee of Paul's estate upon his death, as Paul Allen never married and didn't have any kids.\n\nJody Allen's official title is \"Chair of the Seattle Seahawks.\" She also chair and co-founder of Vale Group, a private holding company she co-founded with her brother.\n\nJody Allen is selling the Seahawks, but that was the expectation after Paul Allen passed away. The former Seahawks owner and Microsoft co-founder died in 2018, and commissioner Roger Goodell said it was clear after Allen passed away that the team would be sold.\n\nRoger Goodell on the #Seahawks possible sale: \"I think when Paul Allen passed away, it was made clear that the team would eventually be sold. Jody is doing a great job. ... Eventually the team will need to be sold. That will be Jody's decision when she does that.\"\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 2, 2026\n\nJody Allen is Paul Allen's sister, as she was his closest living relative upon his death. She currently serves as the executor and trustee of the Paul G. Allen Trust, which is how she became the Seahawks owner.\n\nWhen Jody Allen became executor and trustee of Paul Allen's trust, she became in control of Paul Allen's $20 billion net worth. While Jody isn't worth nearly that much herself, her brother was one of the richest people in the world when he died.",

    "fullText": "Guarding Michael Jordan never felt more like a death sentence than it did for Kevin Johnson during the 1993 NBA Finals. Johnson has long stated how he feels terrible about how Charles Barkley is ringless due to that Finals. However, with MJ on the other end of the court, perhaps that was inevitable?\n\nThe ’93 Finals had several intersecting and interesting storylines. One was the fact that Jordannever saw Dan Majerle as a threat. Dan was propped up to be a ‘Jordan stopper’ of sorts but this didn’t move the needle for him in the slightest.\n\nGames 1 and 2 saw Jordan score a total of 73 points and the Bulls go up 2-0 with Majerle guarding ‘His Airness’. The Suns coaching staff saw this as a clear misstep and defensive deficiency. Their next course of action? Have Kevin Johnson take up the task.\n\n“I walk straight in that church and I sit in the front row. I’m like, ‘Jesus, I don’t believe in you no more,’” saidJohnson the Club520 podcast. The concept of having to defend Michael in the Finals was so unfathomable for KJ that he, at first, believed he had dreamt it.\n\nWhen he told MJ during Game 3’s jumpball that he was guarding him, the latter’s reaction was a mere “Huh?”\n\nFunnily enough, the Suns ended up winning Game 3 in triple overtime despite Jordan’s 44. Johnson was no scrub however as he held his own on the offensive end as well, going 11-24 from the field and having 25 points on the night.\n\nThe Suns won two out of their three games in Chicago but would eventually lose Game 6, leading to the Bulls winning their third straight title.\n\nKevin is still quite proud of the way he guarded Mike though, saying “Take that Mike!” on the podcast when speaking on keeping MJ below the scoring average he had when guarded by Dan.\n\nThe post Kevin Johnson Entered a Church to Pray Before Guarding Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals appeared first on The SportsRush.",

However, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte believes New England missed out on numerous opportunities throughout the game.\n\n“I said they played well, I wouldn’t discredit that,” Boutte said on Sunday after a reporter asked what made Seattle’s defense so good. “But I think as an offense we left opportunities out there too, as I said, they did everything we expected them to do, we just didn’t execute.”\n\nSeattle’s defense did an excellent job of keeping New England in check for most of the game, holding it scoreless until the fourth quarter.\n\nBoutte had a challenging night, finishing with just one catch on five targets for a total of 21 yards. A significant factor in Boutte’s struggles was quarterback Drake Maye, who also had a difficult game, turning the ball over three times — two interceptions and a fumble.\n\nNew England’s offensive line also played a significant role in the offense’s inability to move the ball, leading to Maye being sacked six times.\n\nThe Patriots struggled to find their rhythm until late in the game, but by then, they were too far behind on the scoreboard to mount a comeback.\n\nPatriots, Celtics Meet Same Fate On Super Bowl Sunday",

    "description": "Super Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at - this is how a thunderous evening in California panned out.",
    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nBad Bunny piles on Puerto Rican patriotism at Super Bowl half-time show\n\nWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "The Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-7 in Super Bowl LX. MVP Kenneth Walker III leads the record EIGHT Studs from tonight!",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks just won the Super Bowl!\n\nThey defeated the New England Patriots 29-7 in Super Bowl LX to claim their second Lombardi Trophy as a franchise. There's so much to be happy about, but none more than the blessing of watching this team this season. We have an entire offseason to break it down, but for now and for the last time this season...\n\nHere are your Studs and Duds for the Super Bowl LX!\n\nKenneth Walker III rushed for 135 yards on 27 carries (averaging 5.0 YPC) and won Super Bowl MVP. He added 26 receiving yards, too, but his biggest asset to the team was being the only offensive force that consistently instilled fear in either defense the entire night. There’s no Seahawk who saw their stock increase so dramatically this postseason – or in any ever, for that matter.\n\nDevon Witherspoon had a case for Super Bowl MVP himself. He had four tackles, a sack, a tackle for loss, and forced Uchenna Nwosu’s pick-six. His blitz usage was the difference in the game on defense, and will go down in the history books as one of the most versatile adjustments a player has ever been able to make in a game of this magnitude.\n\nDerick Hall had two sacks, two tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and two tackles. He became the matchup of the night on Patriots rookie left tackle Will Campbell and won in dramatic fashion. He woke up today viewed as a rotational player, and ended a franchise legend tonight. By matching his entire regular season sack total in the Super Bowl, he literall saved it for when it counted most.\n\nUchenna Nwosu will finally go down in Seahawks lore as his consistent force of work ought to. His 45-yard pick six capped off a massively under-appreciated season with one of the biggest defensive plays in the history of the organization. He didn’t get a single tackle, sack or tackle for loss, but it does not matter– because he played his role on this incredibly deep team by coming up in the clutch in the big moment when it was needed most.\n\nBoth Jason Myers and Michael Dickson had all-time performances in the kicking game tonight. Myers set a record for kicker points in a Super Bowl with 17, going 5/5 on field goals and 2/2 on extra points. Dickson averaged 47.9 yards per punt (335 total yards on 7 punts) and gave Seattle a field-position security blanket in the defensive battle that moved the needle more than any single-game punting performance in recent memory.\n\nAt just 38 years old, Mike Macdonald became the third youngest head coach to ever win a Super Bowl, and also the first defensive play-calling one. He refused to lift the Lombardi trophy without his players doing so at the same time as well, which sums up his selflessness as well as possible. Mike Vrabel might’ve won Coach of the Year, but if one were to power rank the NFL head coaches right now, he would undoubtedly be number one.\n\nByron Murphy II was the sleeper MVP of the night. He had two sacks, two tackles for loss, and consistently reset the line of scrimmage. He was the best lineman on either team tonight. In just his second year, there’s truly no limit to what his career trajectory can look like after becoming a Super Bowl Champion in his second year- and dominating on the biggest stage, at that.\n\nThe 12s were PHENOMENAL tonight, as they were all season long. They set the tone before kickoff and during every snap by drowning the entire stadium out with chants of “SEA… HAWKS!” Throughout the whole game. Coach Macdonald’s motto of 12 as one represents the rebirth that has taken place in the Pacific Northwest's football fanbase, who hold the most revered fan tradition in the NFL.\n\nThe Seahawks defense only allowed 23 rushing yards to Rhamondre Stevenson, meaning they finished the entire season- 20 total games- without allowing a 100-yard rusher. Their streak extends to 29 straight games dating back to last season. Truly mind-boggling… while the Patriots defense honed in on Jaxon Smith-Njigba and held him quiet, Cooper Kupp led the team with 61 receiving yards… JSN soaked up all the attention and allowed his teammates to thrive so he could get his first ring… AJ Barner scored the Seahawks only offensive touchdown, routing up another safety on a corner route to do so in a huge moment, just like the Rams game in Week 16… and as Mike Macdonald says, it's not just about the 53, but the entire 70. From the entire roster to the practice squad, everyone on the Seahawks just earned a Super Bowl Ring that they'll cherish for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe game was close for the majority, so of course, there were a few duds. Cornerbacks Josh Jobe and Tariq Woolen lost it on consecutive plays, beginning with Jobe throwing an open-hand punch at Stefon Diggs, followed immediately by Mack Hollins dominating Tariq Woolen for 24- and 35-yards plus a touchdown on two consecutive plays. There were plenty of other areas for improvement- if the Seahawks thought they were perfect, they would never have got there in the first place. However, we at Seahawks Wire will be talking about that ALL offseason, every single day- for now, it’s time to celebrate, if it ever was!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks Super Bowl LX: Studs and Duds from the championship win",

    "fullText": "Is Drake Maye the next Dan Marino or Joe Burrow? How rough Super Bowl 60 changes narrative for Patriots QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDrake Maye became the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl when he faced the Seahawks in Super Bowl 60. Unfortunately, after a 29-13 setback in which he struggled against Seattle's defense, Maye, 23, is now also the second-youngest QB to lose a Super Bowl.\n\nHall of Famer Dan Marino was also 23 when he led the Dolphins to defeat in Super Bowl 19, a 38-16 loss to Joe Montana and the 49ers. Like Maye, he was in his second season. Marino was the MVP in the 1984 regular season before the playoffs, while Maye was the MVP runner-up in 2025.\n\nWith Marino emerging as an all-time great passer quickly, it was expected he would return to the Super Bowl at least once—and maybe several times—to give Montana a natural big-game rival. Instead, Marino played 15 more seasons and never won another AFC championship with Miami.\n\nBad Bunny halftime show reviews\n\nWinners and losers from Super Bowl 60\n\nKenneth Walker ends 28-year RB MVP drought\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade details\n\nBest and worst Super Bowl commercials in 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Roethlisberger was 23 on the Steelers team that won Super Bowl 40 over the Seahawks. He went on to win a second ring in Super Bowl 44.\n\nSo the question is: Does the loss to the Seahawks set up Maye for another “tough no-ring” scenario, or can the Patriots count on returning to the Super Bowl with him at quarterback?\n\nIt’s hard to say now, but let’s consider the other second-year QBs who joined Maye, Marino, and Roethlisberger in starting a Super Bowl.\n\nKurt Warner was the first to win, with the 1999 Rams in Super Bowl 34. Then came Tom Brady, whose Patriots upset Warner’s Rams two years later in Super Bowl 36. The other second-year winner was Russell Wilson, who led the 2013 Seahawks to victory in Super Bowl 48.\n\nUnfortunately, Maye now joins Marino, Colin Kaepernick, Joe Burrow, and Brock Purdy-- fellow second-year QBs who lost their first Super Bowl trips. Excluding the two 49ers, who lost close games, Maye most closely resembles Marino and Burrow.\n\nBurrow’s Bengals lost Super Bowl 56 to the Rams, 23-20, and were hammered by the defense. He faced Aaron Donald and the Rams’ pass rush, which tied a Super Bowl record with seven sacks -- Donald and Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller had two each.\n\nMaye was sacked six times by the Seahawks. He also threw a pick-six as part of two interceptions and lost a fumble under pressure. Likewise, Marino was sacked four times by the 49ers and threw two interceptions.\n\nMORE: Why Drake Maye's legacy won't be defined by Super Bowl 60 flop\n\nBurrow is still active, giving him a chance for a Super Bowl return. But repeated punishment and a combination of offensive line and defensive shortcomings have limited his championship prospects.\n\nThe Patriots, on paper, appear poised to remain long-term AFC contenders with Maye at QB and Mike Vrabel as head coach. But nothing is guaranteed in the NFL—New England should know this after going from 3-14 to 14-3 in just one year. Fortune can be fleeting.\n\nMaye will enter his third season on his rookie deal, meaning the clock is ticking before the No. 3 overall pick of 2024 earns a lucrative long-term extension—a second contract that could restrict signing and retaining free agents while staying under the salary cap. Burrow’s extension handcuffed the Bengals’ ability to surround him with talent, particularly at wide receiver.\n\nMarino signed an extension in 1986, three years after being drafted and less than two years after losing the Super Bowl. The Dolphins made him the league’s highest-paid player both times, limiting spending elsewhere.\n\nGoing into Super Bowl 60, there was talk of Maye channeling a second-year Brady and launching another Patriots dynasty with Vrabel coaching instead of Belichick. Now, Maye’s brutal loss casts doubt on that plan, given his struggles against tougher defenses leading up to the Seahawks.\n\nMORE: Was Drake Maye's effort against Seattle one of the worst QB performances in Super Bowl history?\n\nMaye also had the chance to emerge as the AFC’s consistent challenger to Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, potentially winning a Super Bowl before Burrow, Josh Allen, or Lamar Jackson. This past season was unusual, with Mahomes and Jackson absent from the playoffs. Concerns remain that Maye’s strong stats came against a favorable schedule, and he may regress in Year 3.\n\nIn 2021, before Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl, he led the league in completion percentage (70.4) and yards per pass attempt (8.9), but was sacked a league-high 51 times. In 2025, Maye also led the league in completion percentage (72.0) and yards per attempt (8.9) and was sacked 47 times -- foreshadowing the 21 sacks he endured in just four playoff games through Super Bowl 60.\n\nNew England likely will improve pass protection, but Maye’s tendency to extend plays with his athleticism may always lead to a high sack rate.=\n\nWarner, Brady, Wilson, and Roethlisberger were unflappable in their first Super Bowls as second-year QBs. Maye did not show that same composure, even compared with Burrow and Marino.\n\nThe Super Bowl and preceding playoffs are a different beast than the regular season. Ask Allen and Jackson -- two recent non-Mahomes MVPs—who failed to reach the Super Bowl despite Hall of Fame credentials. Four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers is running out of time to earn a second ring. Cam Newton, Matt Ryan, and Matthew Stafford had their chances once -- and that was it.\n\nMORE: Drake Maye gets emotional following Super Bowl 60 loss\n\nWinning a Super Bowl as a top passer is difficult, which makes one appreciate Brady, Mahomes, and Montana all the more for executing in clutch playoff moments.\n\nThe 23-year-old Maye has time on his side -- but so did Marino, and so did Burrow, who four years later is still chasing his first ring.\n\nThis is a great QB era. The AFC is loaded with elite passers and high-potential stars. Unfortunately, history suggests Maye is more likely to follow the path of Marino or Burrow than become the next Brady or Mahomes.",

    "fullText": "Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shared his “disappointed” reaction after a heartbreaking Super Bowl loss. The New England Patriots battled it out on the field against the Seattle Seahawks on February 8. Notably, the Seahawks defeated the Patriots 29–13. Unsurprisingly, Patriots coach Vrabel isn’t pleased with his team’s performance on the field.\n\nPatriots coach Mike Vrabel is understandably “disappointed” after the Super Bowl loss. Notably, Vrabel took over an underperforming team and led them to a remarkable 14‑3 regular-season record before winning three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nFans who watched the game would acknowledge that the Patriots did not deliver their best against the Seahawks. Vrabel, without mincing any words, stated, “Disappointed. I reminded them that we’re 307 days into what hopefully is a long, successful relationship and program” (via Patriots. com).\n\nContinuing further, he shared, “It’s OK to be disappointed. We have to be disappointed and upset together. . . . Every year, somebody’s going to lose this game. We have to remember what it feels like and make sure it’s not repeatable.”\n\nPatriots’ long-term fans believe the team wasn’t up to the mark in yesterday’s game and barely performed to their potential. However, coach Vrabel is proud of the team’s efforts and believes their performance in yesterday’s match was not an accurate “reflection of our year.” Vrabel also added that making this kind of jump in their first year together “wasn’t very valuable.”\n\nMoreover, the 50-year-old believes the heartbreaking loss is the entire team’s responsibility, and the onus isn’t on any single player.\n\nVrabel remarked, “We can sit here and try to put it all on one guy. You’ll be disappointed cause that’ll never happen. It starts with us as the coaching staff, making sure that we’re doing our part. Obviously, we have to be able to execute. We’ve gotta be able to protect, and when we do protect, we have to be able to progress through and throw to guys open and help the quarterback, and then he’s gotta be better. That’s just how it goes.”\n\nThe post Patriots’ Coach Mike Vrabel ‘Disappointed’ After Super Bowl Loss appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United will travel to face West Ham United tomorrow evening following a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Red Devils have played the Hammers 157 times in their history, winning 74 matches.\n\nWest Ham have won 50 matches, and there have been 33 draws between the two sides.\n\nHere are three storylines to look forward to.\n\nManchester United struggled against most sides last season as they slumped to a 15th-place finish in the league.\n\nThe BBC reports, “West Ham did the double over Manchester United last season, and drew 1-1 at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture this season.”\n\nIn addition, “only once have they avoided defeat in both league meetings with the Red Devils in consecutive campaigns, doing so in 1932-33/1933-34.”\n\nThe Red Devils have also lost four of their last six matches against the Hammers.\n\n“Having lost two of their first three Premier League away games this season, Manchester United have now lost just one of their last nine on the road (winning four and drawing four).\n\nMore specifically, they have also won their last two league games away at London sides.\n\nThe Red Devils have not won three times in a row in the capital in the same season since January/February 2019.\n\nThere is no doubt that United’s increased competency on the road has been a significant factor in their much improved Premier League results this season.\n\nThe Brazilian has been one of the best signings in the league this season.\n\nAlongside Bryan Mbeumo, he has completely transformed United’s attack and has scored against Arsenal and Fulham in recent matches.\n\nThe BBC reports that, “Matheus Cunha has had a hand in four goals in his last five away Premier League appearances for Manchester United (three goals, one assist).”\n\nSurprisingly, though, he has never scored in five Premier League games versus the Hammers, only facing Manchester City more without scoring (six matches).\n\nHe will certainly be looking to rectify this on Tuesday night.\n\nFeatured image Matt McNulty via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks produced a devastating defensive display to beat the New England Patriots and claim their second Super Bowl victory.\n\nTwo of the NFL's strongest defences battled it out in Sunday's showpiece and the Seahawks emphatically came out on top to win 29-13 at Levi's Stadium in.\n\nIt was a defensive performance for the ages and Briton Aden Durde played a pivotal role, becoming the first overseas coach to win the Unites States' biggest game.\n\nSeattle's 46-year-old defensive co-ordinator has helped create the most feared defence in the NFL, which has become known as 'the Dark Side', and they showed why on American football's biggest stage in Santa Clara, California.\n\nNew England's second-year quarterback Drake Maye narrowly missed out on this season's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award but was stifled by the Seahawks, who claimed six sacks, forced three turnovers and scored a defensive touchdown.\n\nAfter Seattle led 9-0 at half-time, Maye's first turnover resulted in the game's opening touchdown for tight end AJ Barner early in the fourth quarter.\n\nLinebacker Uchenna Nwosu then returned an interception for a 45-yard touchdown, while Jason Meyers kicked a record five field goals as Seattle denied the Patriots a record seventh Super Bowl win.\n\n\"We were the better team; we're the best team. We loved each other, we believed in each other and now we're champions,\" Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald told NBC.\n\n\"We went to the dark side tonight. We love our players - they made it happen. They made it come to life.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nMost of the 70,823 crowd seemed to favour Seattle, who came into the game as narrow favourites, and their win also means quarterback Sam Darnold completed his redemption story after being written off as a starting NFL quarterback.\n\nThe Seahawks are Darnold's fifth team in his eight-year career - and third in three years - but in his first year in Seattle the former third overall draft pick has won the game's biggest prize.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been haunted by a comment he made as he struggled in a game against the Patriots in 2019, when he said \"I'm seeing ghosts\", but Darnold has now exorcised those demons.\n\nInstead, it was Maye who suffered a nightmare when confronted with the fast, physical defence that Durde and coach Macdonald have fashioned in their two seasons together in Seattle.\n\nSuch is the breadth and depth of the threat it carries that Devon Witherspoon claimed a sack from cornerback. He, Derick Hall and Rylie Mills only registered 2.5 sacks between them all season but all three got to Maye in the first half.\n\nThe Patriots earned only four first downs before the interval and 52 yards in total. Some cruel folks on social media even joked that Bad Bunny gained more yards as he carried a ball during his half-time show.\n\nHall's second sack forced a fumble which was recovered by Byron Murphy, who also sacked Maye twice as the Dark Side wrote themselves into Seattle folklore alongside the 'Legion of Boom', the defence that led the Seahawks to their previous Super Bowl win in 2014.\n\n\"My team-mates and my coaches, they believed in me,\" Darnold told NBC.\n\n\"Since the first training camp, every single day we came to work. Shout-out to our offensive line for everything they did in the game. But I've also got to shout out our defence.\n\n\"We did it. It's been such a special journey with these guys. So much hard work has been out into this and we did it.\"\n\nNew England were playing in their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick.\n\nThe duo led the Patriots to six Super Bowl wins, tying the NFL record with the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Mike Vrabel playing in three of those wins.\n\nAfter two 4-13 seasons, the former linebacker returned to New England as head coach and has rebuilt the roster, leading the Patriots to a record-extending 12th Super Bowl appearance.\n\nVrabel was hoping to become the first man to win a Super Bowl as a player and head coach with the same franchise, while Maye aimed to be the youngest quarterback to win the big game.\n\nAs well as having the league's best pass completion rate this season, Maye has impressed with his ability to scramble and escape the pressure.\n\nThere was no getting away from the Seahawks, though, as New England were unable to get their run game going or get star receiver Stefon Diggs into the game.\n\nMaye did give the Patriots hope as he found Mack Hollins for a touchdown to cut the score to 19-7, but he was intercepted on their next two possessions, meaning Rhamondre Stevenson's late score was a consolation.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nStu Lantz, a 6-foot-3 guard, starred at the University of Nebraska before being taken in the 1968 NBA Draft by the San Diego Rockets. His best season came during the 1970-71 campaign, when he averaged 20.6 points, five rebounds and 4.2 assists a game.\n\nHe was traded to the Lakers during the 1974-75 season and stayed with them through the following season, which was his last in the NBA. He retired with career averages of 12.4 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists a game, including averages of 7.1 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 20.9 minutes per game with Los Angeles.\n\nLantz, of course, is best known as the Lakers' longtime television color commentator. He started in that role in the fall of 1987 and worked alongside legendary play-by-play man Chick Hearn until Hearn's death in 2002. Today, Lantz works alongside Bill Macdonald, who has been the Lakers' television play-by-play man since the 2011-12 campaign.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 23 — Stu Lantz",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s summer rebuild is already taking shape and, as reported by The Telegraph, Sandro Tonali has surged high on the club’s shortlist to replace Casemiro. It is a signal of intent from Old Trafford, a move that would blend long term planning with immediate competitive ambition.\n\nUnited’s need is obvious. Casemiro’s confirmed summer departure removes not only experience but also tactical security from the engine room. For a side still searching for rhythm, control, and authority in central areas, recruitment here will define the next phase of the project.\n\nTonali, 25, represents both pedigree and Premier League adaptation, a rare combination in a volatile market.\n\nUnited’s interest in Tonali sits within a broader scouting framework. Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are also under consideration, while previous inquiries into Brighton’s Carlos Baleba underline the club’s desire for athletic, progressive midfielders.\n\nYet Tonali’s profile stands apart.\n\nThree seasons in England have hardened his tactical awareness. Newcastle’s £55m investment in 2023 now looks modest in an era where Enzo Fernández, Moisés Caicedo and Declan Rice all commanded fees beyond £100m. Newcastle would expect similar territory for Tonali, particularly given his contract running to 2029.\n\nThere is risk attached, notably his betting ban earlier in his Premier League spell, but United appear focused on the footballer rather than the controversy.\n\nTransfer narratives rarely ignite without agent intervention and Giuseppe Riso’s remarks have ensured this story gathers pace.\n\n“Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,” Riso said.\n\nHe added, “We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We’ll see how the season ends and then we’ll decide what to do.”\n\nPerhaps most telling was the ambiguity, “There’s no preference. It’s still early. What we’re saying today won’t apply tomorrow.”\n\nSuch language keeps every elite suitor engaged, Juventus, Manchester City, Arsenal, and now United most prominently.\n\nEuropean qualification may ultimately shape Tonali’s future. Newcastle sit 12th in the Premier League and face Qarabag in a Champions League play off, their route back to the competition remains uncertain.\n\nRiso acknowledged the emotional tie, stating, “Newcastle couldn’t let him go now, and there’s no point moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.”\n\nAttachment, though, often bends under competitive gravity. Tonali wants Champions League football. United believe they can offer it, or at least return to it swiftly.\n\nFrom a strategic lens, this pursuit feels calculated. Tonali is entering his peak years, already Premier League tested, tactically disciplined, and technically secure under pressure. He would not merely replace Casemiro, he would recalibrate United’s midfield identity.\n\nFrom a Manchester United supporter’s perspective, this report lands somewhere between excitement and caution.\n\nTonali is undeniably elite. His tempo control, positional intelligence, and ability to dictate transitions would address long standing midfield imbalances. United have too often lacked composure in high leverage matches, particularly against top six rivals. Tonali would change that dynamic.\n\nYet £100m territory demands scrutiny. Fans will remember recent midfield spending sprees across the league and question value versus urgency. Is Tonali transformative, or simply premium stabilisation.\n\nThere is also squad context. When Casemiro departs, United require not one midfielder but two, possibly three, depending on outgoings. Investing heavily in a single profile could restrict broader rebuild flexibility.\n\nStill, the upside is compelling. Tonali offers leadership without theatrics, control without slowing play, and durability in England’s most demanding fixtures.\n\nIf United are serious about restoring midfield authority, this is the calibre required. The question is not quality, it is whether the club can align finance, Champions League qualification, and long term squad architecture around one decisive signing.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool will soon need to replace their club legend and a 21-year-old super talent could do it.\n\nIt's a time of metamorphosis at Anfield. Liverpool are in the middle of replacing the old icons who helped the club reach its pinnacle and bring in new stars who can take the baton from them and continue the success.\n\nWe've already seen the likes of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Trent Alexander-Arnold depart.\n\nBut their exodus was just the beginning. Mo Salah is likely going to depart in the summer and he will be followed shortly by Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker.\n\nEveryone is focusing on replacements for Van Dijk and Salah at the moment, so Alisson has gone under the radar.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nSure, Liverpool have Giorgi Mamardashvili who seems like an ideal successor. However, Liverpool may need more depth than that.\n\nMamardashvili is a competent back-up but can he be trusted to be the no.1? Or perhaps Liverpool should have two no.1s instead competing for the same spot?\n\nAfter Alisson's departure, the latter makes the most sense. Mamardashvili is still young for a goalkeeper and he may benefit from added competition and working alongside someone who is just as eager and hungry to oust him from the no.1 spot.\n\nRight now, Alisson's contract expires in the summer of 2026. The club has an option to extend the deal until 2027, and they likely will.\n\nSo, we don't have to worry about replacing the Brazilian just yet. Unless, Liverpool decide to surprise us all and let Alisson either leave on a free or for a fee if they extend his contract.\n\nThere have been times when it felt like Alisson has been open to returning to Brazil so it is something to keep an eye on.\n\nFortunately, Liverpool are well-placed to find his successor. The club has an excellent track-record with goalkeepers and right now there is an outstanding young super talent in Europe's top five leagues who seems like he could be the perfect successor to Alisson's throne.\n\nLet us introduce you to RC Lens' 21-year-old goalkeeper Robin Risser. The France U21 international has been ever-present in a side going toe to toe with Paris Saint Germain in Ligue 1 this season.\n\nHe's played a key role in Lens' success.\n\nCurrently, Risser has prevented 4.56 goals in Ligue 1, which is the second highest among goalkeepers in the competition in the current campaign.\n\nHe also has a save rate of 77%, which is the third highest among goalkeepers.\n\nRisser does exactly what you ask from a goalkeeper. He prevents goals and makes important stops. But there's more to him than that.\n\nHe is very similar to Alisson in terms of his ability to come off his line. Risser is fast and he's very good in one vs one situations, meaning even when his defence exposes him, he can prevent the opposition from scoring.\n\nAt 21-years-old, he's still extremely young for a goalkeeper, but he is absolutely one of the brightest talents out there in European football at the moment.\n\nRisser's ability to come out and smother opposition attackers makes him the ideal and inevitable Alisson heir.\n\nIt won't be easy for anyone to live up to the Brazilian's reputation. Alisson is a club legend for everything that he achieved at Anfield. However, if anyone can do it, it's Risser.\n\nKeep an eye out on this potential move.",

    "title": "Beyond VDI: The rise of the 1:1 remote workstation",
    "description": "From compact ‘desktops’ to purpose-built blades, welcome to a new wave of dedicated 1:1 datacentre-ready workstations",
    "fullText": "For more than a decade, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and cloud workstations have promised flexible, centrally managed workstation resources for design and engineering teams that use CAD, BIM and other 3D software. But a parallel trend is now gathering serious momentum: the rise of the 1:1 remote workstation.\n\nIn a 1:1 model, each user gets remote access to a dedicated physical workstation with its own CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no resource sharing, no slicing of processors, and no contention with other users.\n\nIn many ways, it combines the performance predictability of a local desktop workstation with many of the management, security and centralised data benefits traditionally associated with VDI.\n\nThis shift is being driven by performance demands, changing IT priorities, and the growing maturity of remote access technologies. And it is appearing in several distinct forms. What is a 1:1 remote workstation?\n\nUnlike VDI or public cloud environments like AWS or Microsoft Azure, where multiple users typically share CPUs and GPUs through virtualisation, a 1:1 remote workstation assigns an entire machine to a single user. That machine typically sits in racks in a dedicated server room or datacentre, either on-premise or hosted by a third-party service provider. However, it could also sit under a desk, or in the corner of an office.\n\nThe user accesses the workstation remotely using high-performance display protocols such as Mechdyne TGX, PCoIP (HP Anyware), NICE DCV (now Amazon DCV), Parsec or Citrix HDX. However, from a compute perspective, it behaves exactly like a local workstation.\n\nOne of the most visible indicators of the 1:1 trend, especially for design and engineering teams that use CAD and BIM software, is the relocation of compact desktop workstations into the datacentre.\n\nMachines such as the HP Z2 Mini and Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF are increasingly being mounted in racks rather than sitting on desks. Thanks to their small form factors, these systems offer impressive density. With the ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, for example, seven individual workstations can be housed in a 5U chassis.\n\nDensity matters for several reasons. Higher density reduces rack space requirements, lowers hosting costs, and improves energy efficiency per user.\n\nCrucially, these are still true desktop workstations. Users get the same CPU frequencies, GPU options and application performance they would expect from a machine under their desk. Remote management and access capabilities are typically added via specialist add-in cards, enabling IT teams to control and maintain systems centrally.\n\nCompact desktop workstations do have their limitations. While they can offer the highest-frequency CPUs — capable of boosting into Turbo for excellent performance in single-threaded CAD and BIM applications such as Solidworks and Autodesk Revit — they are typically restricted to low-profile GPUs or integrated graphics.\n\nIn the past, this confined them largely to traditional CAD and BIM workflows. However, the latest compact models are surprisingly capable, with models including the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada and Nvidia RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell SFF, having enough graphics horsepower and GPU memory to comfortably handle mainstream visualisation workflows in applications such as Enscape, Twinmotion, KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize.\n\nWhile GPU sharing is rarely a major issue for day-to-day CAD and BIM work, it becomes critical for visualisation and rendering workflows, where the GPU may be driven at 100% utilisation for extended periods\n\nFor more demanding users, high-end desktop tower workstations with high core count CPUs, lots of memory, and one or more exceedingly powerful full height professional GPUs, can also be racked, extending the adapted desktop model to advanced visualisation, simulation and AI workflows. However, achievable density is massively reduced.\n\nThe major workstation players – Dell, HP and Lenovo – design most of their tower systems to be rack mountable, as does Boxx. However, that’s not the case for all systems, especially custom manufacturers that often use consumer gaming chassis.\n\nAnother strand of the trend is the resurgence of the purpose-built workstation blade, a form factor first pioneered by HP in the early 2000s. Each blade is a slender, self-contained 1:1 workstation with its own CPU, GPU, memory, and storage, engineered specifically for deployment in the datacentre.\n\nIn 2025, new systems have arrived from Amulet Hotkey, while Computle has gone one step further, launching a workstation-as-a-service offering built around its own dedicated blade hardware. Established players such as Boxx and ClearCube also continue to offer blade-based workstation platforms.\n\nBlades provide a clean, highly modular approach to workstation deployment. The density is impressive with typically around 10 blades slotting into 5U or 6U chassis. Blades also integrate neatly into existing datacentre infrastructure, relying on centralised and redundant power, which simplifies cabling and makes them inherently well suited to remote-access scenarios.\n\nFrom a performance perspective, blades are ideal for CAD and BIM workflows, commonly featuring high frequency CPUs and single slot pro GPUs. However, some blades can also support full height, dual slot GPUs, which can push graphics performance into the realms of high-end visualisation, beyond that of the compact desktop workstation.\n\nFor organisations standardising on remote-first workflows, blades represent a highly engineered interpretation of the 1:1 workstation concept.\n\nSitting alongside blades are 1U, 2U, and 4U rack-mounted workstations, purpose-built, single-user workstations designed specifically for racks. The ultra-slim 1U systems are sometimes called “pizza boxes”.\n\nRack workstations appeal to organisations seeking maximum performance, full-size professional GPUs, and good integration with existing server infrastructure — without the need for a blade chassis. Like other 1:1 approaches, they deliver predictable, dedicated performance while avoiding the complexity of heavy virtualisation.\n\nThe downside of rack workstations is their low density—particularly for CAD and BIM workflows, where the most suitable graphics cards are often small, entry-level models, leaving much of the large internal space unused.\n\nThere’s a tonne of firms that offer dedicated rack workstations, including PC Specialists, Armari, Novatech, G2 Digital, Exxact, Titan, ACnodes, BOXX, Puget Systems, and Supermicro. HP and Dell also have rack systems but these are now several years old and, presumably, being phased out in favour of small form factor workstations.\n\nThe strongest argument for 1:1 remote workstations is performance.\n\nEach user gets dedicated CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no noisy neighbour effect, no unexpected slowdowns because another user happens to be rendering or running a simulation.\n\nCPUs are typically Intel Core processors, which deliver very high clock frequencies and aggressive Turbo behaviour. This is especially important for CAD and BIM applications, which often rely on single-threaded or lightly threaded performance.\n\nIn contrast, VDI and cloud workstations rely on virtualised CPUs, where users receive a fraction of a processor. These virtualised environments often use server-class CPUs such as Intel Xeon or AMD Epyc, which prioritise core count over frequency. Even specialist CAD-focused VDI platforms based on AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro involve CPU virtualisation and typically do not allow the processor to go into Turbo.\n\nAnd frequency really matters for performance. Even simple tasks, such as opening a model or “syncing to central”, are significantly impacted by low CPU frequency. When working with huge models, this can create a major bottleneck, potentially taking hours of out of the working week.\n\nOn the GPU side, 1:1 systems avoid contention entirely. While GPU sharing is rarely a major issue for day-to-day CAD and BIM work, it becomes critical for visualisation and rendering workflows, where the GPU may be driven at 100% utilisation for extended periods. A dedicated GPU ensures consistent, predictable performance.\n\nThe strongest argument for 1:1 remote workstations is performance. Each user gets dedicated CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no noisy neighbour effect, no unexpected slowdowns because another user happens to be rendering or running a simulation\n\nThere’s also the matter of GPU memory to consider. A typical entry-level pro GPU for design viz, such as the Nvidia RTX 2000 Pro Blackwell, comes with 20 GB of memory. To get this amount in a VDI setup would be very expensive. And if you don’t have enough GPU memory to load or render a scene, performance can drop dramatically, or software can even crash.\n\nAs with VDI, organisations can choose where and how their 1:1 workstations are hosted.\n\nSome firms deploy systems on-premise, purchasing hardware from vendors such as HP, Lenovo, Amulet Hotkey, ClearCube and Boxx. Lenovo, in particular, is working to simplify deployment through its Lenovo Access Blueprints, which provide reference architectures and guidance.\n\nOthers opt for fully managed services, hosting dedicated workstations in third-party datacentres. Providers such as IMSCAD, Computle and Creative ITC deliver managed 1:1 workstation platforms, combining dedicated hardware with subscription-based services.\n\nInterestingly, neither HP nor Lenovo has gone so far as to offer their own workstation-as-a-service platforms directly. Instead, they prefer to work through specialist partners, allowing customers to choose between ownership and service-based consumption models.\n\nVDI’s greatest strength has always been flexibility: the ability to resize virtual machines and dynamically allocate CPU, GPU and memory resources.\n\nA 1:1 workstation is inherently more fixed. You cannot simply dial up more cores or memory on demand. However, organisations can still achieve flexibility by deploying a mixed portfolio of workstation configurations tailored to different user profiles.\n\nMany firms are also adopting hybrid strategies, combining VDI for lighter or more variable workloads with 1:1 remote workstations for power users who demand guaranteed performance.\n\nNot all solutions fit neatly into either camp. Service providers like Inevidesk occupy a middle ground: its vdesk solution virtualises a Threadripper Pro CPU shared among seven users, but each user receives a dedicated GPU.\n\nThis approach sacrifices some CPU predictability and frequency but ensures consistent GPU performance, making it attractive for demanding visualisation tools where GPU contention is the primary concern.\n\nInevidesk’s approach also offers good flexibility, with the option to quickly reallocate CPU and memory resources to different VMs or pool GPU resources at night for compute intensive workflows such as rendering or AI training.\n\nEnergy efficiency is often promoted as a key advantage of VDI, with vendors claiming it has a smaller carbon footprint than maintaining multiple 1:1 workstations. The logic is straightforward: instead of powering and cooling multiple processors, graphics cards, and power supplies, a single shared infrastructure can support many users.\n\nIf reducing energy consumption is a priority, it pays to examine the details. Some past carbon comparisons we’ve seen don’t hold up under closer scrutiny, based on maximum power draw rather than typical usage. However, a recent report commissioned by Inevidesk comparing its vdesk platform to a hosted 1:1 desktop workstation, takes a more measured approach and demonstrates tangible energy savings in practice.\n\nThat said, 1:1 workstation vendors are also taking energy consumption seriously. Amulet Hotkey, for example, offers lower energy laptop processors, HP has machines with the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro processor with integrated graphics, and Computle is exploring ways to reduce energy use in its blade systems.\n\n1:1 workstations can also offer cost savings, but there are several factors to consider. On the hardware side, multiple entry-level GPUs — such as the Nvidia RTX A1000 — are often less expensive than a single high-end datacentre GPU used for VDI, like the Nvidia L40, though this depends on how many virtual machines you intend to support. This principle extends to more powerful GPUs as well: some vendors, such as Computle, provide gaming-focused GeForce GPUs instead of the more costly, passively cooled datacentre variants. On the other hand, 1:1 workstations require more individual components, including multiple motherboards, power supplies, fans, and in the case of adapted desktops, aesthetically-pleasing chassis that never see the light of day.\n\nThe software stack for 1:1 workstations is also more simple. There is no need for virtualisation software, and GPU licensing is straightforward. For example, slicing a GPU for VDI requires an Nvidia RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) software license, whereas standard free Nvidia RTX drivers are sufficient for a 1:1 workstation.\n\nThere are many compelling reasons why design and engineering firms may favour 1:1 workstations over VDI, with performance chief among them. Time and again, we’ve heard of VDI proof-of-concept projects that fail due to user pushback, particularly when performance falls short of what designers and engineers expect from a CAD workstation. In some organisations, this has become a hard line: firms such as HOK, for example, have stated they will not consider cloud workstations / virtualised server CPUs because of the performance penalties associated with single-threaded workflows.\n\nThat’s not to say VDI doesn’t have its place. Its strengths lie in flexibility, centralised management, and, in the case of public cloud offerings, global availability at scale. But for organisations where performance, user satisfaction, and workflow continuity are paramount, 1:1 remote workstations remain a highly compelling choice for those making the move from desktop to datacentre.\n\nHP’s 1:1 remote workstation spotlight falls on the HP Z2 Mini, a tiny powerhouse that comes in two flavours.\n\nThe HP Z2 Mini G1i packs high frequency Intel Core Ultra CPUs with discrete Nvidia GPUs up to the powerful RTX 4000 SFF, while the HP Z2 Mini G1a runs on the AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro processor with integrated Radeon graphics (see review here). Thanks to its smaller processor package and integrated PSU, the G1a offers a slight advantage in terms of rack density, fitting five units in 4U, compared with six G1i units in 5U.\n\nLenovo’s 1:1 workstation offering centres on the ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, a compact system with a BMC card for ‘server-grade’ remote management (see review).\n\nConfigurable with Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPUs and Nvidia RTX GPUs up to the RTX 4000 SFF, it packs a punch for CAD and viz workflows while delivering good density with up to seven units in a 5U rack space. For even higher density, the ThinkStation P3 Tiny delivers twelve systems in 5U. However, the micro workstation is limited to CAD and BIM workflows, with a narrow range of GPUs up to the Nvidia RTX A1000.\n\nCompared with HP and Lenovo, Dell is much less vocal about its 1:1 remote workstation offering, which centres on the Dell Pro Max Micro desktop, which packs seven units into a 5U rack.\n\nUnlike the HP Z2 Mini G1i and Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, which can be configured with 125W Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPUs, the Dell Pro Max Micro is limited to the 65W Intel Core Ultra 9 285. However, this is unlikely to impact performance in single-threaded CAD and BIM workflows. GPU options include the Nvidia RTX A1000 for CAD and the RTX 4000 SFF Ada for visualisation workloads.\n\nAmulet Hotkey’s CoreStation HX is built for the datacentre combining redundant power and cooling with ‘full remote system management’ via a 5U enclosure that can accommodate up to 12 workstation nodes.\n\nThe CoreStation HX2000 is built around laptop processors, up to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H and MXM GPUs up to the CAD-focused Nvidia RTX 2000 Ada.\n\nFor more demanding workflows, the upcoming CoreStation HX3000 will feature desktop processors up to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, paired with low-profile Nvidia RTX and Intel Arc Pro GPUs.\n\nComputle is a workstation-as-a-service offering powered by its own 1:1 custom blade workstations, which are purpose-built for the datacentre.\n\nCustomers can choose from four standard configurations centred on the Intel Core i7- 14700, with GPU options up to the Nvidia ‘Blackwell’ RTX 5090. For more flexibility, components can be mixed and matched, including the Intel Core i9-14900, AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, or Threadripper Pro processors. Professional GPU options include the CAD-focused Nvidia RTX A2000 and high-end RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96 GB).\n\nClearCube stands out for its extremely broad portfolio of 1:1 workstations that are purpose built for the datacentre.\n\nAt the heart of its range is the CAD Pro, a rack-dense system that fits ten blades in a 6U chassis. The CAD Pro can be configured with a choice of Intel Core CPUs and single-slot Nvidia GPUs, up to the viz-capable RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell, which is more powerful than the SFF variant found in compact 1:1 desktops. For higher end workloads, the CAD Elite line offers dedicated 1U and 2U rack workstations with GPUs up to the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Max-Q.\n\nBoxx Flexx is a datacentre– ready 1:1 workstation system, that can support up to ten 1G modules or five 2G modules (or all configurations in between) in a standard 5U rack enclosure.\n\nBoxx Flexx offers an enviable combination of density and performance, with the 1G modules offering liquid-cooled Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPUs and one double-width Nvidia GPU, while the 2G modules support two double-width GPUs.\n\nBoxx also offers BoxxCloud, a workstation-as-a-service solution where Flexx workstations are hosted in regional datacentres.\n\nInevidesk offers a VDI solution that has some characteristics of a 1:1 remote workstation. Each rack-mounted server or ‘pod’ can host up to seven GPUaccelerated virtual desktops called vdesks.\n\nThe Threadripper Pro CPU and memory is virtualised, but each vdesk gets a dedicated GPU, such as the Nvidia RTX 4000 Ada, for predictable graphics performance. Virtual processors and memory can be adjusted, while multiple GPUs can be assigned to a single vdesk to boost performance in GPU rendering or AI workflows.",

We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we've had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.\n\nThey called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:\n\nAdding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…\n\nContainers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren't a deployment method. You shouldn't need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you're not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren't competent enough to deploy a container either.\n\nKubernetes: If you don't need containers, then you don't need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won't happen, so you won't lose any of that imaginary business.\n\n(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)\n\nThe cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company's important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.\n\n(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There's Just Somebody Else's Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)\n\nAnything \"as a service\" – it doesn't matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don't even get servers, just OS instances. That's even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don't even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it's running; you don't get software, and you don't even know what data you have or how it's stored – you're paying for access to your own stuff.\n\n(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch's Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)\n\nThe blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world's slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they're longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.\n\nWhich brings us round to \"generative AI\" or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can't be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn't. It's predictive text turned up to 11. It can't even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:\n\nThe \"i\" in \"LLM\" stands for intelligence.\n\n(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)\n\nHonestly, we can't fault any of this reasoning. We've looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it's not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it \"relatively new,\" it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google's Gmail in 2004.\n\nCloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.\n\nWhoever \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn't come to The Reg's attention until 2011.\n\n2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.\n\nKubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running \"Borg\" internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.\n\nSo in chronological order, those are:\n\n2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS\n\n2004: SaaS reaches the general public\n\n2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD's Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme\n\n2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world\n\n2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff\n\nAll right, yes, rather more than 15 years. \"A century of tech BS\" seems a bit over the top when it's only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.\n\nObviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers' religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®",

    "title": "Russian officials are warning Putin that a financial crisis could arrive this summer, report says, while his war on Ukraine becomes too big to fail",
    "description": "\"Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail.\"",
    "fullText": "The Kremlin’s financial situation is becoming increasingly dire and could come to a head in a matter of months as oil revenue shrinks while President Vladimir Putin shows no intention of ending his war on Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials have been warning Putin with growing alarm that a financial crisis could hit by the summer, sources told the Washington Post. They pointed to weak oil revenue, which crashed by 50% in January from a year earlier, and a budget deficit that continues to widen, even after Putin hiked taxes on consumers.\n\nA Moscow business executive also told the Post that the crisis could arrive in “three or four months” amid spiraling inflation, adding that restaurants have been closing and thousands of workers are getting laid off.\n\nThe economic strains go back to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago. As sanctions took hold and Putin mobilized the economy for a prolonged war, a tight labor market and high inflation forced the central bank to keep interest rates high. Recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, more workers not being paid, getting furloughed, or seeing their hours cut. As a result, consumers are having trouble servicing their loans, raising concerns of a crash in the financial sector.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post in December on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to pay off loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nThe Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, a state-backed Russian think tank, said in December the country could face a banking crisis by October if loan troubles worsen and depositors pull out their funds, according to the Post.\n\n“The situation in the Russian economy has deteriorated markedly,” wrote Dmitry Belousov, head of the think tank, in a note seen by the Financial Times. “The economy has entered the brink of stagflation for the first time since early 2023.”\n\nRussia’s financial woes could become even more serious as Europe weighs additional sanctions on so-called shadow fleet tankers used to ship Moscow’s oil. That would add to recent U.S. penalties on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nThe West’s tighter sanctions regime has forced Russia to offer steeper discounts on its crude exports, while the recent slide in global oil prices has already hurt its top revenue generator.\n\nDespite the worsening fiscal outlook, Moscow is still spending heavily on weapons and incentives to lure fresh recruits to the army. To cover revenue shortfalls, Russia has tapped its sovereign wealth fund, but that is running out now too.\n\nRussia has also suffered staggering losses on the battlefield, with an estimated 1.2 million killed or wounded since the war began. Last month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said more than 30,000 Russian troops died in December alone—an average of 1,000 each day—to gain only minimal territory.\n\nAt the same time, European officials have pointed out that Russia is losing strategically, with Ukraine likely headed for EU membership, NATO growing larger after adding new member states, and Europe ramping up defense spending significantly.\n\n“So people are saying that Russia wants to continue the war because they want more territory—that’s rubbish,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month at the World Economic Forum. “Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail. When you add on to that the Russian economy is in shambles, which means they’re not going to be able to pay their soldiers which means zero growth, end of reserves, interest rates and inflation in double digits. So Putin cannot afford to end this war. This is my big worry.”\n\nIndeed, while Russia has engaged in on-again, off-again talks to end the war, it continues to bombard Ukraine with missiles and drones, targeting its energy infrastructure.\n\nRussian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials just ended two days of talks in Abu Dhabi with little progress reported. In comments released on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. wants the war to end by June and plans a fresh round of negotiations.\n\n“America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams—Ukraine and Russia—meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

So we need to bring ​it back.\"\n\n\"When we leave office my goal, for this administration, is 40% market share in leading-edge semiconductor ‌manufacturing.\"\n\nTaiwan and the U.S. reached a deal last month to lower tariffs on the island's exports to 15% from 20% and for Taiwan to increase its investment in the country.\n\nCheng said that there would be no relocation of Taiwan's science parks, but Taiwan was willing to share its experience in building an industry cluster and help the U.S. develop a similar environment.\n\nShe also said she was confident that Taiwan's semiconductor capacity - including existing, ⁠under construction and planned projects across advanced manufacturing, advanced packaging ​and the broader supply chain - would far exceed its investment ​in the U.S. or any other country.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC last month, Lutnick said his goal was to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire chip supply chain and production ‍to the U.S. He said ⁠that if this does not happen, tariffs on Taiwan would likely rise to 100%.",

    "fullText": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The man who killed 51 Muslim worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand’s deadliest mass shooting told an appeals court Monday that he felt forced to admit to the crimes because of “irrationality” due to harsh prison conditions, as he sought to have his guilty pleas discarded.\n\nA panel of three judges at the Court of Appeal in Wellington will hear five days of evidence about Brenton Tarrant’s claim that he was not fit to plead to the terrorism, murder and attempted murder charges he faced after the 2019 attack in the city of Christchurch. If his bid is successful, his case would return to court for a trial, which was averted in March 2020 when he admitted to the hate-fueled shooting.\n\nHe is also seeking to appeal his sentence of life without the chance of parole, which had never been imposed in New Zealand before. Tarrant’s evidence Monday about his mental state when he pleaded guilty was the first time he had spoken substantively in a public setting since he livestreamed the 2019 massacre on Facebook.\n\nShooter says he suffered “nervous exhaustion”\n\nThe Australian man, a self-declared white supremacist, migrated to New Zealand with a view to committing the massacre, which he planned in detail. He amassed a cache of semiautomatic weapons, took steps to avoid detection and wrote a lengthy manifesto before he drove from Dunedin to Christchurch in March 2019 and opened fire at two mosques.\n\nAlong with 51 people killed, the youngest a 3-year-old boy, dozens of others were severely wounded. The attack was considered one of New Zealand’s darkest days and institutions have sought to curb the spread of Tarrant’s message through legal orders and a ban on possession of his manifesto or video of the attack.\n\nMonday’s hearing took place under tight security constraints that severely limited who could view Tarrant’s evidence, which included some reporters and those hurt or bereaved in the massacre. Tarrant, who wore a white button-down shirt and black-rimmed glasses and had a shaved head, spoke on video from a white-walled room at Auckland Prison.\n\nAnswering questions from a Crown lawyer and from lawyers representing him, Tarrant, 35, said his mental health had deteriorated due to conditions in prison, where he was held in solitary confinement with limited reading material or contact with other prisoners.\n\nCrown lawyers say no evidence of serious mental illness\n\nCrown lawyer Barnaby Hawes suggested to Tarrant during questioning that the Australian man had other options. He could have requested a delay in his trial date on mental health grounds or could have proceeded to trial and defended himself, Hawes said.\n\nHawes also put to Tarrant that there was little evidence in the documentation of his behavior by mental health experts and prison staff that he was in any kind of serious mental crisis. Tarrant suggested that signs of mental illness he displayed hadn’t been recorded and that at times he had sought to mask them.\n\n“I was definitely doing everything possible to come across as confident, assured, mentally well,” he told the court. Tarrant’s behavior “reflected the political movement I’m a part of,” he added. “So I always wanted to put on the best front possible.”\n\nHe agreed that he had had access to legal advice throughout the court process. Tarrant’s current lawyers have been granted name suppression because they feared representing him would make them unsafe.\n\nThe appeal outcome is due later\n\nBids to appeal convictions or sentences in New Zealand must be made within 20 working days. Tarrant was about two years late in seeking an appeal, filing documents with the court in September 2022.\n\nHe told the court Monday that his bid had been late because he hadn’t had access to the information required to make it.\n\nThe hearing is due to run for the rest of the week but the judges are expected to release their decision at a later date. If they reject Tarrant’s attempt to have his guilty pleas discarded, a later hearing will focus on his bid to appeal his sentence.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — It is pre-dawn in the historic Podil district of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and warm light from the Spelta bakery-bistro’s window pierces the darkness outside. On a wooden surface dusted with flour, the baker Oleksandr Kutsenko skilfully divides and shapes soft, damp pieces of dough. As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "description": "Lack of a state floodplain policy in Texas enabled oil companies to build in areas hit by an epic inundation less than 30 years ago.",
    "fullText": "GONZALES - More than 500 enormous oil tanks dot the floodplains of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries across one of Texas' leading oil fields, posing risk of environmental disaster in a flood climatologists say is almost certain to come.\n\nLongtime residents of this area's historic ranchlands vividly remember the last time these plains filled with water, in a biblical inundation in 1998. But that was before the fracking boom that hit the region because of the oil-rich geological formation that lies beneath it, known as the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nToday, a repeat of the historic flood could wreak havoc, an Inside Climate News investigation has found.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of tanks full of oil that are going to float away,\" said Sara Dubose, a fifth-generation landowner in Gonzales County with 10 tanks in the floodplain on her family's ranchlands, each holding up to 21,000 gallons of oil or toxic wastewater. \"Spill all over our land and ruin it for 100 years.\"\n\nAlmost 20 feet of water could submerge some of the tanks on the Dubose family's land in a flooding event similar to 1998, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nInside Climate News scoured satellite imagery of the area to identify batteries of oil tanks and other oil field infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale near waterways in the Guadalupe River Basin. Using latitude and longitude coordinates of each tank battery, the analysis used FEMA flood mapping data to extract the agency's estimates for the depths of its benchmark flood scenarios at each location.\n\nIn some areas, the 1998 flood exceeded the worst-case scenario considered by disaster planners. FEMA calls it the \"500-year flood,\" a hypothetical event the agency estimates has a 0.2% chance of happening in any year.\n\nToday, a 500-year flood across the entire area analyzed would cover at least 22 tank batteries containing 144 individual oil and wastewater tanks with 10 or more feet of water. Of those, 12 tanks would sit beneath at least 20 feet of water.\n\nFEMA's estimates for a 500-year flood understate present risk in many locations, research shows, as warming air and oceans continue to fuel an intensification of extreme rainfall.\n\nDubose experienced the 1998 flood, when the Guadalupe River sprang from its banks and filled the shallow valleys at the edge of these coastal plains. The water almost reached her house, 7 miles from the river, where it trapped her for a week, covering U.S. 183 in both directions as it drained slowly into San Antonio Bay on the coast.\n\nIn a warming world with more intense rainfall, a future flood could be even more severe.\n\n\"One day, it's going to happen,\" Dubose said. \"We've all been concerned about the oil field flooding.\"\n\nWhen flooding hit a smaller oil field in 2013 in northeastern Colorado, authorities tallied two dozen overturned tanks and almost 90,000 gallons of oil and wastewater spilled. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, millions of gallons of oil spilled when several supersized storage tanks floated off their pads. In 1994, flooding on the San Jacinto River in East Texas severed eight pipelines, ignited massive fires, injured hundreds of people and released more than 2 million gallons of petroleum products.\n\nLast summer, severe flooding in the Texas Hill Country near Kerrville washed away a girls' summer camp and killed more than 100 people along the Guadalupe River, 150 miles upstream from the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nThe rules for building in floodplains in Texas fall to county governments, often small and rural. The 78 tank batteries in the Guadalupe floodplains analyzed all sit within Gonzales and DeWitt counties, which have a combined population of about 40,000 people.\n\nIt was left to the governments of the two counties to design and implement floodplain policies during the shale oil boom.\n\n\"Those are not issues that most counties, on an individual basis, are well suited to handle,\" said Todd Votteler, former executive manager of science, intergovernmental relations and policy at the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. \"It raises a question of how serious the state is about avoiding future flood damage in high-risk areas if we don't have a statewide policy.\"\n\nTank batteries at well sites aren't typically secured to the ground by anything but the weight of the equipment and the oil and wastewater inside them. While they are especially vulnerable, they aren't the only industry infrastructure that could be affected by flooding. Eight oil pipelines and about two dozen gas pipelines also cross the Guadalupe River in the Eagle Ford Shale, and others cross local creeks.\n\nThe batteries in the floodplain on Dubose's property were previously operated by Canadian firm Baytex Energy, which sold all of its Eagle Ford Shale assets in November for $3.2 billion to an undisclosed buyer. Other operators with numerous batteries in the floodplains include EOG Resources, Devon Energy and Burlington Resources, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe floodplains also contain many open and buried pits of drilling waste. Dubose unsuccessfully sued an oil company in 2018, alleging that the unlined pit where it buried drilling mud and wastewater on her property was responsible for the orange, gassy goo that seeped up from the earth during heavy rainfall.\n\n\"Think about all the stuff that's soaked into the ground,\" said David Muir, a fifth-generation landowner with more than a dozen wells on his property. \"They've got thousands of chemicals that go into the drilling mud.\"\n\nMuir's land has been in his family since the 1840s. Outside his old, single-story ranch house near the border of Gonzales and DeWitt counties, a private airplane hangar and a waterpark-style swimming pool commemorate the riches fracking has brought to the region.\n\nInside the house between clamoring dogs, Muir sifted through boxes of photos that predated the shale boom. He pulled out strips of 11 film photos taped together to show the vast landscape of water that overtook this rolling savannah on the morning of Oct. 17, 1998.\n\nIt rose far past the tops of the trees. It even covered a spot on Muir's land where a tank battery now stands, 1.5 miles from the Guadalupe River.\n\n\"I thought the whole world was going to flood,\" he said as he flipped through the old pictures. \"We haven't had a flood like that since the oil field hit us.\"\n\nIt all seemed to happen in minutes, recalled Ben Prause, a former elected executive of DeWitt County who presided during the flood. The water wasn't even raging but almost calm as it swiftly rose up to swallow about two-thirds of the town of Cuero. In one case, he said, sheriff's deputies entered a home with water to their knees to save an old woman. When they walked out minutes later, the water was at their chests.\n\n\"It was so rapid,\" said Prause, 92, at his home in downtown Cuero, a few blocks from the 1998 waterline. \"It was just terrible. Water was everywhere.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the Guadalupe River, he said. Several major tributaries also flooded to make the situation worse. Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of Plum Creek and Sandies Creek, which both gushed simultaneously into the Guadalupe.\n\n\"What made it so bad is they all hit about the same time,\" he said.\n\nThese creeks barely trickle for most of the year, said Prause, a 1950 graduate of Cuero High School, but on rare occasions their large floodplains fill.\n\nIn 1998 the floodwaters south of Gonzales were several miles wide, said a report issued the next year by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and FEMA, exceeding predicted worst-case scenarios in some areas.\n\n\"It was the flood that many thought would never happen,\" the report said. \"Unfortunately, an even greater flood will occur sometime in the future.\"\n\nThe 1998 flood caused a few oil spills, said James Dodson, 71, co-founder of the San Antonio Bay Partnership and the son of a South Texas pipeline technician. His late wife worked for Texas' environmental regulator and spent weeks overseeing cleanups. But the extent of oil field infrastructure at that time was nothing compared with today.\n\n\"That was long before the Eagle Ford Shale plays came along,\" he said. \"The landscape was so much different in that regard - there's so many more facilities and well pads now.\"\n\nToday, along one eastward turn in the Guadalupe's snaking course, three batteries consisting of 15 tanks would sit under about 20 feet of water in a 500-year flood. One of them, operated by EOG Resources, is just 500 feet from the riverbank.\n\nTwo miles from the Guadalupe River, four tanks operated by Burlington Resources would take on almost 23 feet of water.\n\nNear Boggy Creek, east of the Guadalupe River by the small town of Dreyer, 10 feet of water would cover EOG Resources' Shiner Hub gas processing plant, a complex of 14 tanks, pipes, motors, chemical separators and flares.\n\nAlong Peach Creek, southeast of Gonzales, batteries of 12 and 28 tanks previously operated by Baytex Energy would sit under 13 feet and 8 feet of water, respectively.\n\nThe oil from toppled tanks probably wouldn't spill onto the land around them, said Dodson, a former water department director for the city of Corpus Christi who worked South Texas oil fields in the 1970s. Instead, he predicted, it would float on the water and end up at the edge of the flood's crest, like the rings in a bathtub. More of it, he said, would wash over the creeks and estuaries of San Antonio Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlager, an 89-year-old Catholic nun from Cuero. \"They have these oil wells all through these areas that flooded like it's no problem.\"\n\nThe oil field infrastructure dates back less than 20 years to the shale revolution, when innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unleashed an explosion of new oil exploration.\n\nBack then, Riebschlager, the daughter of a local civic leader, conducted town hall meetings for local families baffled by the swarm of businessmen and lawyers descending on their sleepy countryside, whipping up 100-page contracts and casually writing checks for mind-boggling sums.\n\nMany landowners warned the oil companies about flooding, she said.\n\nRiebschlager related the story of one rancher: \"When they were getting ready to drill there, he said, ‘Please don't drill them here, it's a floodplain. They will flood.' The oil man says, ‘Don't worry, we'll have all the oil and gas out of this ground before the next flood.' ‘\n\nDubose, who missed out on the riches of the oil boom because her mother sold her family's mineral rights, got a similar answer when she mentioned the 1998 floods to the company drilling on her land. She recalls a man telling her: ‘That was a 100-year flood so it won't happen for another 100 years.'\n\nThat's a common misconception surrounding terms like a 100-year and the 500-year flood, said Matthew Berg, CEO of Houston-based water risk management firm Simfero. A former water specialist with Texas A&M AgriLife, he understands why the general public is misled.\n\n\"They would understand a 100-year flood only happens once every 100 years,\" he said. \"That's a problem because statistics don't work that way.\"\n\nSuch flood events don't literally return only once every century. Rather, computer models estimate that such an event has a 1% chance of occurring at any given spot in a year. What happened in previous years doesn't change those odds.\n\nFurthermore, Berg said, these estimated probabilities are \"to some extent meaningless\" where records go back barely 100 years. They are meant for purposes of development planning, not weather forecasting. The likelihood of storms across centuries isn't known. Neither is when the 500-year floodplain of the Guadalupe River may fill up again. Two things are certain, though: It will fill again and the chances are increasing.\n\nThe warming climate is making precipitation more intense in Texas and beyond. A similar amount of rain falls in fewer, more concentrated storms than it used to, according to a 2024 report from the Office of the Texas State Climatologist at Texas A&M University.\n\n\"Many studies have documented an increase in extreme rainfall in Texas and surrounding areas,\" the report said. \"Extreme rainfall is strongly affected by increased temperatures.\"\n\nIn Texas, as elsewhere on the planet, all 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2011. Warming is a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, released in large part by burning fossil fuels like the oil in the tanks sitting in the floodplains across the Eagle Ford Shale. And warmer air can hold more water vapor, leading to heavier downpours.\n\nIf global fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb, so will extreme rainfall.\n\n\"Extreme precipitation is expected to increase in intensity on average statewide,\" the state climatologist's report said. \"We anticipate an additional increase of about 10% in expected extreme rainfall intensity in 2036 compared to 2001-2020 and an overall increase of over 20% compared to 1950-1999.\"\n\nThose changes in rainfall intensity correspond to a 50% increase in the likelihood of extreme precipitation compared to 2001-2020, the report said, and a 100% increase compared to 1950-1999.\n\nHowever, heavy rains alone don't always make a mega-flood. They have to fall on just the right areas, across multiple tributaries of a single river so that their waters all converge at once downstream.\n\nIf a 500-year flood returns to the Eagle Ford Shale, it's hard to tell how much oil, wastewater and other petroleum fluids could spill. Conventional oil field tanks range from 210 to 750 barrels in size, or from 13,000 to 32,000 gallons. Typical tank batteries in the Eagle Ford often include five 500-barrel oil tanks and one 500-barrel wastewater tank, according to an investor presentation by Baytex Energy. Some are out of use or empty, some are full, most are in between.\n\nWhatever fluids wash down the river would flow into San Antonio Bay, part of the winter grounds for the world's last flock of wild, endangered whooping cranes, then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"With a flood, it causes a lot more dispersion. It breaks it up then you've got oil mixed with sediment and debris. It can stink and it's much, much harder to clean up,\" said Diane Wilson, founder of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and a 77-year-old former shrimper who lives near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. \"It would be unbelievable, the damage it could do.\"\n\nLast summer, Dubose said, she thought it was about to happen. As soon as she saw the news late at night on the Fourth of July, she rushed out and sped her white Hummer down ranch roads to the river.\n\nIncredible rainfall was hitting the Guadalupe about 150 miles upstream in the Hill Country. Online posts said the water had washed away a summer camp for girls.\n\nDubose had flashbacks to 1998, when there were also overnight rainstorms far upriver that put this region underwater for a week. So she hurried to save a mobile home parked at her fishing camp by the river, the same spot where she'd lost a mobile home in 1998.\n\nAlmost there, she passed nervously between the towering, three-story tank batteries in the floodplain on her land, then past the site of the buried waste where, she said, the grass dies each time heavy rains bring the water table to the surface.\n\nLuckily for Dubose, no torrent came downriver. For Kerrville, in the Hill Country, it was the worst flood since 1987. But all the heavy rain fell upstream of a major dam and reservoir, where water levels were low enough to absorb it. So the Eagle Ford Shale was spared, for now.\n\n\"What happened in Kerrville, if that happens here, that's a really bad situation,\" Dubose said. \"We've told the oil field, this is going to flood someday.\"\n\nThis report is published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain.",

    "fullText": "Feb 8 (Reuters) - A prominent Venezuelan opposition politician was kidnapped in Caracas on Sunday night just hours after his release from jail, according to his son and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina ​Machado, casting uncertainty over government vows to free political prisoners.\n\nJuan Pablo Guanipa, a close ally of opposition ‌leader Machado, was freed earlier on Sunday after more than eight months in jail on accusations of leading a terrorist plot, after months in ‌hiding.\n\nHis release followed promises by Venezuela's government to pass an amnesty law and release more prisoners, as U.S. pressure mounts a month after the Trump administration captured and deposed long-time leader Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGuanipa's son Ramon Guanipa said in a video on social media his father was ambushed by 10 heavily armed, unidentified men who he called \"officials.\"\n\n\"My father has again been kidnapped,\" he ⁠said. \"I demand proof of life immediately.\"\n\nVenezuela's government ‌did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Guanipa's disappearance following his release.\n\nMachado, who won the Nobel for her efforts to unseat Maduro, also urged Guanipa's release.\n\n\"Heavily armed men ‍dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force,\" she said in a post on X, noting the incident took place in the Los Chorros area of the capital Caracas.\n\nJust hours before, the elder Guanipa had posted videos to ​social media in which he spoke to journalists and a crowd of cheering supporters. He urged the release ‌of other political prisoners and called the current administration illegitimate.\n\nMaduro's reelection in 2024 was widely seen as rigged and a number of countries, including the U.S., do not recognize his government's legitimacy.\n\nGuanipa said in an interview with a local online outlet that he spoke briefly with Machado after being let go, and hoped to speak with her further the next day.\n\nVenezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years that the country's socialist government uses detentions to stamp ⁠out dissent.\n\nThe government denies holding political prisoners and says those jailed ​have committed crimes. Officials say nearly 900 of these people have been ​released, but they have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including releases from previous years. The government has not provided an official list of how many prisoners will ‍be released or revealed their ⁠identities.\n\nRights group Foro Penal has said 383 political prisoners had been let go since the Venezuelan government announced on January 8 that it would begin a new series of releases. It counted another 35 releases on ⁠Sunday, including opposition politician Freddy Superlano and lawyer Perkins Rocha, also close allies of Machado.\n\nThe group's director Alfredo Romero said on social media they ‌did not yet have clear information about who took Guanipa.",

    "description": "Ro Khanna sent a searing letter in which he stated his intention to ask Ghislaine Maxwell if she or Jeffrey Epstein ever procured \"underage girls\" for Trump.",
    "fullText": "Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) sent a searing letter in which he stated his intention to ask Ghislaine Maxwell if she or Jeffrey Epstein ever procured “underage girls” for President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-TN) announced last month that Maxwell would be deposed by the committee, and that deposition is scheduled for this Monday.\n\nBut on Sunday, Maxwell’s attorney made clear she intends to plead the Fifth Amendment.\n\nCongressman Khanna, the ranking member on the committee, responded with a searing letter to Comer listing the questions he planned to ask Maxwell — including a few loaded ones about Trump:\n\n4. It is well documented that you, President Donald Trump, and Mr. Epstein had a social relationship, and there are several photographs of you together. Did you or Mr. Epstein ever arrange, facilitate, or provide access to underage girls to President Trump?\n\n5. After President Trump publicly stated that he would “look at” a possible pardon for you, did you or anyone acting on your behalf have any discussions with him or his representatives about a pardon or reduced sentence in exchange for your silence?\n\nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC\n\nIt is my understanding that Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell intends to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and decline to answer all substantive questions at her upcoming deposition before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThis position appears inconsistent with Ms. Maxwell’s prior conduct, as she did not invoke the Fifth Amendment when she previously met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss substantially similar subject matter.\n\nI understand that Ms. Maxwell intends to assert this privilege on a “blanket basis” by reading a prepared statement at the outset of the deposition and refusing to permit Members to question her individually through counsel, rather than invoking the privilege on a question-by-question basis.\n\nAccordingly, for the sake of clarity, I am submitting in this letter the questions I intend to ask at Ms. Maxwell’s deposition and request confirmation from the Chair as to whether she intends to invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to the following questions:\n\n1. On December 17, 2025, you filed a habeas corpus petition stating that “four named co-conspirators” and 25 men who entered into secret settlements were not indicted as part of the investigation. Is that statement accurate?\n\n2. Who are the four co-conspirators and the 25 men, other than Jeffrey Epstein, who sexually abused minors at Epstein’s island, his New Mexico ranch, or his New York residence, and why do you believe they were not indicted?\n\n3. What information, evidence, or personal knowledge do you have regarding why these individuals were not charged or prosecuted by federal authorities?\n\n4. It is well documented that you, President Donald Trump, and Mr. Epstein had a social relationship, and there are several photographs of you together. Did you or Mr. Epstein ever arrange, facilitate, or provide access to underage girls to President Trump?\n\n5. After President Trump publicly stated that he would “look at” a possible pardon for you, did you or anyone acting on your behalf have any discussions with him or his representatives about a pardon or reduced sentence in exchange for your silence?\n\n6. What client lists or records did you or Mr. Epstein maintain that document the identities of clients or associates?\n\n7. Please identify any foreign governments or intelligence services, including those associated with Russia and Israel, that Mr. Epstein shared information with or otherwise acted on behalf of, and describe the nature and purpose of any such relationships.\n\nTo avoid any doubt about the scope of Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment claim, please confirm that Ms. Maxwell intends to invoke the Fifth Amendment on these questions. Furthermore, I request this document be moved into the official record at the start of Ms. Maxwell’s deposition.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nThe post BREAKING: Searing Dem Letter Asks Ghislaine Maxwell If She or Epstein Procured ‘Underage Girls to President Trump’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The White House’s Board of Peace aims to advance Gaza ceasefire, but Hamas control, armed militias, and Rafah crossing delays pose major challenges.\n\nThe White House is planning to host a meeting of its Board of Peace on February 19, Axios reported over the weekend. This is important because it continues to try to push forward the ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHowever, as recent Israeli airstrikes have shown, there are many challenges in Gaza. Hamas is still armed, and it is accused of continuing to plot attacks or cause chaos in Gaza.\n\nThe Board of Peace is supposed to support reconstruction, as well as an international security force and the disarmament ofHamas. In addition, it has an executive board and also a High Representative for Gaza. With so many moving parts, a meeting in mid-February is important.\n\nUS President ratified the Board of Peace on January 22. The second phase of the Gaza plan began in January. US Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have been pushing for investment in Gaza and reconstruction and other elements of the ceasefire to move forward. Both men were on the US aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln over the weekend as US-Iran tensions continue.\n\nWhen the Board of Peace was ratified, the Chief Commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, Dr. Ali Sha’ath, said, “I want to start by thanking President Donald J. Trump and his Administration for his intensive efforts to advance peace in the whole region… These efforts created the opportunity for a new future in Gaza, but what will really matter is what comes next.”\n\nShaath is supposed to be running the technical committee that is supposed to help Gaza move toward peace in this phase. However, it doesn't appear his committee has been allowed to do any real work in Gaza. Israel appears to oppose the committee and oppose any links to the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn essence, this means that Hamas remains in control of Gaza. Officials in Jerusalem have said the Palestinian Authority will have no role in governance in Gaza. They have not said Hamas will have no role in governance, which appears to mean Hamas will remain.\n\nOn the other hand, another phenomenon in Gaza is also concerning. Reports that various militias in Gaza are harassing Gazans who seek to come and go from Rafah raise questions about the policy of having armed militias in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Israel’s Ynet, “four days after Rafah crossing reopened, Gaza residents still disappointed. Only about 20 patients have been allowed to leave Gaza out of some 22,000 requests, while just 75 people have returned after lengthy inspections, limited to one suitcase, a phone, and 600 dollars, amid reports of harassment by Abu Shabab militiamen.”\n\nThe report goes on to say that the frustration Gazans feel from long waits at the border is compounded by having to deal with what appears to be lawlessness in the areas between the border and the half of Gaza still controlled by Hamas.\n\n“Adding to the frustration are reports of involvement by members of the Abu Shabab militia from Rafah, which is backed by Israel, in interrogating and detaining those returning to Gaza. Palestinian media, particularly Hamas outlets, highlighted the account of Rutanah al-Rakab, who returned from Egypt this week.”\n\nThe report notes that one woman said, “after the inspections on the Palestinian side ended, militiamen arrived, declared that they were our brothers and that they were fighting Hamas…They grabbed me and tried to hand me over to Israeli forces, but foreign officials operating at the crossing, apparently European monitors, prevented it.”\n\nSome people said they are being interrogated by the militias, and even handcuffed and blindfolded. They also complain of theft by the militia. The question now remains why Gazans are being given this stark choice of living under Hamas rule, which they have known since 2007, and the chaos of militias.\n\nIf the people in Gaza feel the militias are a worse choice than Hamas, then they will gravitate back towards Hamas rule. In addition, it’s not clear what laws the militias operate under to extrajudicially detain people. The reports at Ynet about the militias and the fact that they are armed raise many questions about what is happening in Gaza.\n\nMost successful societies are not run by militias. For instance, the fate of armed groups in Yemen and Syria illustrates how fragile these types of groups can be. The same is true in Iraq, where the US backed what was called the “awakening” of various Sunni tribes in Anbar between 2006 and 2008.\n\nWhile initially successful, the tribal groups did not bring security in the long term. In other contexts, successful states have done away with militias in favor of formal professional armies.\n\nGeorge Washington and the Continental Congress, for instance, sought to professionalize the American Revolution after initial gains by militias near Boston in 1775. Israel immediately got rid of the various armed groups that had been at the forefront of the Jewish underground after the War of Independence.\n\nThe Haganah basically became the modern IDF, and the Irgun and Stern groups were abolished as armed forces. This saved Israel from the kind of chaos and infighting that divided the Arab irregular fighters of 1947-1948.\n\nAnother challenge for Gaza is the fact that the opening of the Rafah crossing, a key part of the second phase of the ceasefire, has had many hurdles. CNN reports that “the first week of the partial reopening of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt was marked by confusion and logistical hurdles, according to Palestinians attempting to cross and multiple sources who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity.”\n\nThe report goes on to say that “the disorder resulted in far fewer Palestinians traversing the border between Egypt and Gaza than was expected, nearly two years after Israel seized and shut the crossing.\n\nWhen the partial reopening was announced last week, an Israeli security official told CNN that 150 Palestinians per day would be allowed to leave Gaza, while only 50 would be permitted to enter. But even that detail was unclear, as Egyptian state media reported that only 50 would be allowed to leave and the same number to enter.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump ratified the Board of Peace on January 22. At the time, the new High Representative for Gaza, Nickolay Mladenov, said, “Who would’ve thought two years ago that we would be sitting here with this group of countries, with this leadership, giving the people of Gaza a new chance?… For too long, Gazans, Palestinians, and Israelis have lived with conflict, with death, with destruction. Now, the page turns.”\n\nIn addition, US Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve Witkoff added, “We have achieved a peace deal in Gaza. We have brought the hostages home… And maybe most importantly, we have created a sense of hope for what the future can bring in Gaza and all other places where the Board of Peace will operate. And I am so honored, Mr. President, to have worked on this on your behalf.”\n\nThe February meeting will be an important symbol, a month after the ratification, to get things moving forward. The hurdles of Rafah may have been worked out by then. The question remains now about the role of the militias and whether people in Gaza will have access to any health care or education that is not run by Hamas.\n\nIf the alternative to Hamas is only men with guns in armed militias, it’s unlikely people in Gaza will choose that as a preferred way of life. This will essentially just create another cycle of the status quo of Hamas in power.\n\nOver the years, some voices have argued that it is a good strategy for Jerusalem to divide Gaza from the West Bank by having Hamas in Gaza. After October 7, it’s unclear if that strategy will continue. So far, the status quo is that Hamas has regained its rule in half of Gaza.",

    "description": "Aoi Onodera, 32, decided to renovate the Japanese home that had been in his family since the 1940s rather than let it fall into disuse.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aoi Onodera, 34, which took place at Aoito, the café he manages in Zushi, Japan. His words have been translated and edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up visiting this house. It originally belonged to my grandfather's older sister, and whenever I traveled down from Iwate, the northern prefecture in Japan where I grew up, this was where the family gathered.\n\nLater, I worked as a rehabilitation consultant at hospitals in Osaka and Yokohama. I moved, but this place was always in the back of my mind.\n\nWhen my great aunt passed away about 14 years ago, the house became something of an akiya — technically empty, though relatives still came by now and then.\n\nSix years ago, I started wondering what we should do with the house. It was in rough shape at the time. The house was built in 1940, and it felt wasteful to let it fade.\n\nThat's when the idea of renovating it — and eventually turning it into a café — began to take shape.\n\nWhat you see is pretty consistent with how it looked before. The original 85-year-old tatami is still intact, and the main beam and post structure remain.\n\nThe shoji paper screen doors are intentionally torn, encouraging kids to poke their fingers through them — some adults can't resist, too. The mud walls used to be darker; painting them white brightened the atmosphere a bit, but overall, we kept things close to the original bones. We added what we had to — like the counter — and let the rest speak for itself.\n\nI wanted the café to feel like a third place, somewhere locals and family could gather casually.\n\nI've been running the café for almost four years now. On weekdays, it's mostly locals, and on weekends and holidays, around 30% of customers are tourists.\n\nThe furniture and many of the paintings have been here since I was a kid, but the lighting was my choice. I traveled to shops in cities across Japan — including Kobe, Chiba, and elsewhere — picking pieces, such as a 1960s American lamp, that matched the mood I wanted.\n\nI spent about six months cleaning, repairing, and preparing the house.\n\nUntil I got started at the café, I'd worked only in hospitals — I had no food-and-drink experience at all — so inventing dishes, prepping ingredients, and managing a kitchen were all new to me. Every part was hard at first.\n\nThe menu now features seasonal vegetables from the region. We also serve desserts like tiramisu and cheesecake.\n\nMy younger sister and I run the café together. I take weekends, she handles weekday afternoons. We have a close relationship, so I don't micromanage. I trust her to run things as she sees fit. I leave it to her good judgment.\n\nl didn't open the café to ride the trend of renovating old Japanese homes around the end of COVID, when more foreigners started visiting and buying property. That was never my motivation.\n\nI just didn't want a place, which had been in the family so long, to fall into disuse. One of my relatives still owns it, and I pay rent monthly. My family tells me they're glad the house looks better now, and locals appreciate having a community spot.\n\nWe also host musical performances here. Since the house was built in the 40s, we like to play music from that era — oldies, jazz, that sort of thing. It fits.\n\nI'm 34 now, and when I look at young Japanese today, I notice how differently they think about work and life. They are more balanced, more creative, more intentional than I was in my 20s.\n\nFor me, juggling the café, freelance rehabilitation work, and managing concerts has become the right pace. Back at the hospital, I sometimes get in trouble for doing things my own way and working too freely, so maybe this kind of multi-directional work suits me better. It allows me to express myself.\n\nIn a hospital, my world was doctors, nurses, and patients. Opening the café introduced me to a much wider community: grandparents, kids, tourists, and people whose values and backgrounds I never would've encountered otherwise.\n\nOf course, as with people in any environment, some customers are wonderful; some are thoughtless and create problems for others. But even that teaches me something, that the world is full of people I wouldn't have met if I'd stayed in the hospital forever.\n\nThis aging house, somehow, continues to beckon new life.\n\nDo you have a story to share about renovating your family's house in Japan?

    "description": "A Google executive explains why he taught his kids to understand AI — and how they ended up vibe coding and participating in a hackathon.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Asif Saleem, a financial services go-to-market lead for Japan and the Asia Pacific region at Google. Asif is the father of 13-year-old Usman Asif and 18-year-old Shanzey Asif. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt's important for parents to help kids understand we're going through a very transformative time. This is like the era when the internet or mobile first emerged. With AI, it may be even bigger.\n\nKids need to understand this and embrace the technology. Whatever they end up studying — computer science, English, or philosophy — they can make AI part of it.\n\nI was curious about Cursor and some of the other vibecoding tools, so I joined a few \"Code with AI\" weekend sessions for executives.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Within a matter of hours, we were able to develop different applications. I developed a statement analyzer for a financial services system.\n\nOnce I came back home, I spoke to my family about it and showed them the demo. My children, Usman and Shanzey, are both tech-savvy, so that drove their interest. They attended the same course a few weeks later.\n\nThey were the youngest in the class. The good part was that they were completely independent, so I let them be on their own. That's how they ventured into vibe coding and participated in Cursor's 24-hour weekend hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThey've become more curious about things. Through vibe coding, they've learned to be more creative and to use technology to understand how things work.\n\nNeither of them has a formal technology background — they're not software developers — but they've been able to think through ideas, be more creative, and use technology to solve problems.\n\nTechnology is the biggest enabler. The question is how humans use it — whether for good or bad. If it's for good, what are the guardrails?\n\nUsing it for good means creating value, solving real challenges, and making information more accessible.\n\nManaging screentime is the reason we developed a reward system for Usman because he's young and he loves gaming. Gaming comes as a reward for achieving goals. Those goals include making your own breakfast, making your bed, or helping clean the house.\n\nWhen Shanzey is studying, she can't use AI for the content she's creating — it can't even be AI-inspired. It has to be her original work.\n\nThat's super important because schools validate whether output is AI-generated. The same applies to Usman.\n\nIt's important to have both physical and digital skills. Usman plays football because physical activity is important at his age. Shanzey is focused on school right now — her exams are very important, and getting good grades matters.\n\nI'd say my role is more like a coach — brainstorming with them. My wife does the same, helping them think through ideas and keeping them honest.\n\nI'm often busy with work, so a lot of this couldn't be done without my wife's help.\n\nThere's nothing better than hands-on learning. That's something I've learned over the last few years.\n\nYou will face challenges and go through them. Parents should get their kids to do things, give them challenges, and nurture them as they work through those challenges. With hands-on experience, they can get better results faster.\n\nWith building an app, we co-create the idea, but then the important part is making it happen and reporting back on progress.\n\nAt Google, I work with enterprise customers trying to transform their businesses with AI. I can see what's happening on the ground and how things are changing.\n\nI also see a lot of young talent at Google. They come in thinking about creating apps and learning skills, and I mentor some of them as well.\n\nIt's important to communicate this to my family. I spent time helping them understand how the world is changing and why it's important for them to understand AI.\n\nIt's not about running away from technology. AI will keep advancing, and the only thing you can do is be accustomed to it, no matter what you want to become.\n\nWe're now in a situation where we have very intelligent large language models, and we're also moving toward agentic AI, where you can work with agents that help you do a lot more. Speed and agility are improving, and you can now work within larger ecosystems that combine humans and machines, achieving much more.\n\nIf you know how to coexist and let machines do meaningful work with you, that's a skill to aspire to.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

Juay said that the company is planning to use AI to detect scammers and catfishers in its app.\n\n\"It is hurting the dating app industry because we see an increase in users who are using AI-generated photos to misrepresent themselves,\" she said.\n\nAnother useful implementation, she said, was using it to help daters ask each other better questions.\n\n\"Chats fizzle out because — in Asia especially — we are more shy and not great at asking each other questions after 'Hi, how are you,' 'What job are you in,' and 'What are your hobbies?'\"\n\nSeveral app makers are exploring ways to add AI to the dating mix.\n\nMatch Group CEO Spencer Rascoff said in a tech event in October that AI is \"changing everything\" about its dating apps. Match Group owns Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid, among others.\n\nIn April, Tinder released \"The Game Game,\" an interactive AI chatbot that allows users to practice flirting for five minutes in \"over-the-top, meet-cute scenarios.\" A Business Insider reporter tried the chatbot and found it largely unhelpful.\n\nGrindr's CEO, George Arison, said on a November earnings call that AI would make its app a \"magical experience.\"\n\nOther apps, like Amata, Facebook Dating, Sitch, and Three Day Rule, work like AI-powered matchmakers, narrowing down the dating pool to appeal to daters experiencing swipe fatigue. A pair of Business Insider reporters who tested the apps found them slightly expensive but appreciated that they did the heavy lifting of planning dates.\n\nAnd some daters are taking matters into their own hands, using AI as a wingman by getting tools like ChatGPT to craft Hinge bios and come up with pickup lines.\n\nCoffee Meets Bagel conducted a survey in November with 1,050 of its users in the US, aged 21 to 35. About 80% said they were comfortable with AI assisting them with dating, such as helping decide who to respond to first based on compatibility and responding to common questions.",

(\"Auntie asked me if I have a lot of girlfriends, a lot of girlfriends / Today I have one, tomorrow I'll have another, but there's no wedding.\")\n\n\"Yo Perreo Sola,\" which loosely translates to \"I Twerk Alone,\" was released as a single from \"YHLQMDLG.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he wrote the song from a woman's perspective (hence the feminine adjective, \"sola,\" in the title) to address sexual harassment in clubs.\n\n\"I wanted a woman's voice to sing it — 'yo perreo sola' — because it doesn't mean the same thing when a man sings it,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"But I do feel like that woman sometimes.\"\n\nThe music video ends with a title card that reads, \"Si no quiere bailar contigo, respeta, ella perrea sola.\" (\"If she doesn't want to dance with you, respect her, she twerks alone.\")\n\n\"Safaera,\" a collaboration with Ñengo Flow and Puerto Rican duo Jowell & Randy, is the 14th track on \"YHLQMDLG.\"\n\n\"Party\" is the 11th track on \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" The studio version features Rauw Alejandro.\n\n\"Voy a Llevarte Pa PR,\" meaning \"I'm Going to Take You to Puerto Rico,\" is the second track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\"\n\n\"Eoo,\" which samples \"Perreo Baby\" by Héctor & Tito, is the 15th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" It won the 2026 Grammy Award for best global music performance.\n\n\"Monaco\" is the second track on Bad Bunny's fifth solo studio album, \"Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana.\"\n\nLady Gaga made an appearance during Bad Bunny's performance to sing a salsa-style version of her hit duet with Bruno Mars (sans Mars).\n\n\"Baile Inolvidable\" is the third track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" The studio version features live salsa arrangements, recorded by students from San Juan's Escuela Libre de Música, according to a press release for the album.\n\n\"Nuevayol\" is the opening track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\"\n\nThe song features a sample of \"Un Verano en Nueva York,\" or \"A Summer in New York,\" originally performed by Andy Montañez and El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico.\n\n\"This album is the result of the experiences that have led me to get to know myself better, even getting to know the rhythms I enjoy most—the ones I truly enjoy singing and creating,\" Bad Bunny said in a statement.\n\n\"I am Puerto Rican, I am Caribbean, and my music, my culture, my country's history run through my veins, from plena to reggaeton,\" he continued. \"At the peak of my career and popularity, I want to show the world who I am.\"\n\nBad Bunny enlisted Ricky Martin to sing \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii,\" a song about American colonization.\n\nThe two Latino singers have worked together in the past; Martin contributed backing vocals to Bad Bunny's 2019 single \"Caro\" and made a cameo in the 2020 music video for \"Yo Visto Así.\"\n\n\"El Apagón,\" which translates to \"The Power Outage,\" is the 16th track on \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" It was later released as the album's seventh single.\n\n\"Café Con Ron\" is the 12th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" The studio version features the Puerto Rican ensemble Los Pleneros de la Cresta.\n\n\"DTMF\" is the 16th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" later released as the album's fourth single.\n\nIt was nominated for both record and song of the year at the 2026 Grammys, but the awards went to \"Luther\" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA and \"Wildflower\" by Billie Eilish, respectively.",

The ad ends with him using OpenAI's Codex tool to further his goals.\n\n\"Our job was to make a film that feels like the beginning of a builder's story with the curiosity, the frustration, and the eventual breakthroughs,\" Michael Tabtabai, OpenAI's vice president of Global Creative, said in a statement.\n\n\"We drew from the influences that shaped our own researchers and engineers, then paired that with real stories from across the country of people using ChatGPT to build in everyday life,\" he said. \"If someone watching thinks, 'I wonder if I can do that,' we've done our job.\"",

It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn't represent our standards of Success, Creativity, or Excellence,\" Trump posted on Truth Social after Bad Bunny's performance.\n\nThe president said, \"nobody understands a word this guy is saying.\" The Grammy award-winning singer has committed to singing only in Spanish.\n\n\"There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a Halftime Show,\" Trump wrote.\n\nThe president also called the show \"just a 'slap in the face' to our Country.\"\n\nEarlier on Sunday, the White House issued a statement from Trump about the Super Bowl, in which the president said he sent his \"best wishes to the athletes and coaches of the New England Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks as they take the field.\" The message did not reference the halftime show.\n\nBad Bunny performed at Super Bowl LX on Sunday just one week after winning three Grammys, including album of the year.\n\nBad Bunny did not mention ICE during his performance, focusing instead on inclusion. His backup dancers ran out with flags of the countries in North and South America.\n\nHe also performed in front of a billboard with the words: \"THE ONLY THING MORE POWERFUL THAN HATE IS LOVE.\" During his set, he held up a football with the words \"TOGETHER, WE ARE AMERICA\" on it.\n\nThe singer made headlines last week for saying \"ICE Out\" during an acceptance speech at the Grammys, a statement that placed him, a celebrity of Puerto Rican heritage, in direct opposition to the president.",

On January 31, there were nationwide strikes against ICE. People poured into the streets, protesting the fatal shootings of Minneapolis residents Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal immigration officers.\n\nThe leaders of Minnesota's biggest corporations, like Target and Cargill, called for peace in an open letter to government officials in January.\n\nBig Tech employees from companies like Google, Amazon, Apple, and Spotify have signed multiple petitions, urging their CEOs to press the White House to abolish ICE and divest from corporate contracts with the agency.",

    "fullText": "Japan's bond market is back under scrutiny after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory pushed government bond yields higher, even as stocks surged to record highs.\n\nOn Sunday, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party secured a decisive win in the general election, giving Takaichi a clear mandate and room to pursue her fiscal agenda.\n\nThat agenda includes increased government spending on defense and social welfare, alongside tax cuts — policies markets have long debated for their impact on Japan's already heavy public debt burden.\n\nFollowing Takaichi's win, Japanese equities surged nearly 6% to record highs on optimism around fiscal support for growth.\n\nBonds, however, moved in the opposite direction. Two-year Japanese government bond yields climbed to their highest level in three decades, while benchmark 10-year yields also rose. Bond prices fall when yields rise.\n\nLonger-dated bonds sent a more mixed signal. Japan's longest-maturity debt — typically the most sensitive to concerns about fiscal sustainability — erased mostly early yield spikes. Yields on 30-year bonds were little changed on the day around midday in Japan, after surging to record highs last month.\n\nJapanese bond yields matter far beyond the country's borders because of Japan's outsize role in global capital flows. Years of ultra-low yields have allowed domestic and foreign investors to borrow cheaply and leverage bets on higher-yielding assets such as US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nThat dynamic has refocused attention on how markets are pricing Japan's fiscal and debt risks under Takaichi's leadership.\n\n\"A bigger mandate is likely to fuel concerns about the potential path of spending plans, warranting renewed weakness in JGBs and the Yen, unless the BoJ were to shift towards faster rate hikes,\" wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Saturday before the polls.\n\nThe Goldman analysts wrote that they expect volatility as markets digest the news.\n\nLast month, Takaichi's call for a snap election rattled global markets and triggered a sharp sell-off in Japanese government bonds, as investors worried her fiscal agenda could further strain public finances.\n\nAnalysts at the time warned the move could serve as a cautionary signal for other heavily indebted governments, as rising bond yields risk pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.\n\nTakaichi has since sought to reassure markets. She said she would pursue a sustainable and responsible fiscal policy and would not rely on deficit-covering sovereign bond issuance to fund a two-year suspension of the food consumption tax.\n\nJapanese government bond yields could still rise further, driven by concerns about increased government spending on areas such as defense and AI, according to Min Joo Kang, a senior economist at ING.\n\nNot all analysts agree that the postelection bond sell-off will last. Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research, excluding Japan, said Takaichi's strong election win gives her the political room to avoid messy policy trade-offs and make clearer, more sustainable decisions about government spending.\n\nHe also pointed to Japan's external balance sheet as a key buffer, arguing that domestic investors can redirect capital back into local markets.\n\n\"Japan's significant holdings of foreign assets (as the world's second largest net creditor) puts it in pole position to re-allocate back home to Japanese assets to the benefit of JPY, JGBs and equities,\" Varathan wrote.",

    "description": "BBC Sport Wales looks at how Wrexham have evolved since being taken over by Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac five years ago.",
    "fullText": "Five years ago, Wrexham's fortunes changed immeasurably.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Rob Mac completed their takeover of the north Wales side on 9 February, 2021 after receiving overwhelming approval from the Wrexham Supporters Trust three months earlier.\n\nThe Hollywood stars have overseen three successive promotions, although their impact goes way beyond the club's seismic on-field achievements.\n\nAs defender Max Cleworth puts it, \"it's been a mental few years\".\n\nFive years of Hollywood owners - the Wrexham timeline\n\nWrexham's on field success is plain for all to see, however, background developments and groundworks are equally important to sustain Reynold's and Mac's ambitions for the north Wales club.\n\nRegulars at the Stok Cae Ras - or the millions of viewers watching games on screens around the globe - will also have noticed a number of alterations to the world's oldest international football stadium still in continuous use.\n\nThe stadium's iconic Kop Stand was demolished in 2023 having been abandoned for 16 years.\n\nA temporary stand, holding around 3,000 supporters, was used during the 2024-25 campaign before being removed to pave way for a new permanent stand.\n\nWork on the stand - which will hold 7,500 fans in total, taking the overall capacity at Stok Cae Ras to 18,000 - started early on in the 2025-26 season and is due to be completed in early 2027.\n\nAs they do not own their Colliers Park training complex, Wrexham are regularly required to train elsewhere, including at Carden Park or at The Rock - now owned by the club.\n\nBut even other aspects including catering and travel arrangements - which include flying to some away matches to help aid recovery - have been tweaked to improve performance.\n\n\"The difference is massive,\" said former club captain Ben Tozer, who made 136 appearances and won back-to-back promotions with Wrexham.\n\n\"Even though some of the really big changes might not have happened – like we still don't have our own training ground – the infrastructure has improved every year.\n\n\"The players always felt looked after, but the levels have gone up.\"\n\nThe growth is not limited to the men's first team though. Far from it.\n\nAcademy manager Gus Williams and professional development phase lead coach Craig Knight are now in situ as the club aims to produce more home-grown talent.\n\nThe women's side have made enormous strides too.\n\nWrexham were in the tier two Adran North at the time of the takeover but are now challenging for the top-flight Adran Premier title - with a place in Europe on the line.\n\nThey also face reigning league champions Cardiff City in the final of the Adran Trophy on 22 February - further typifying how they have developed into one of the best women's sides in Wales.\n\nIt has all ensured the difference at the club is stark, particularly for new signing Davis Keillor-Dunn, who recently returned six years after leaving Wrexham.\n\n\"I'm just buzzing to see the club in the place it's in now,\" he told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"It shows you how much work has been put in and you're seeing the fruits of it on the pitch.\"\n\nLittle by little, piece by piece, the club keeps evolving. But the headline-grabbing exploits of the first team have ultimately been the key driver.\n\n\"It's the balance of building the club and understanding that the club needed some foundations put in place for the long-term,\" said manager Phil Parkinson.\n\n\"But also that we needed to fast-track the quality at first team level because the squad had been neglected for many years, no-one's fault, through a lack of finances, and [the owners] have been very supportive in both of those categories.\"\n\nLate transfer flurry sets Wrexham up for run-in\n\nGlobal brand in an EFL world - Wrexham's £48m cash injection explained\n\nA mere 110 days after the high-profile change in ownership, manager Dean Keates left the club with Wrexham having missed out on a play-off spot in the fifth-tier National League.\n\nJust 32 days later, Parkinson was tasked with leading the Welsh side's resurgence. Despite a gut-wrenching end to his first season as manager, a 5-4 defeat by Grimsby Town in the play-offs, it has been quite the ride since then.\n\nParkinson has managed 213 regular season league matches and Wrexham's record over that period borders on the ridiculous, in a positive way, of course.\n\nHe has overseen 125 wins, 51 draws and just 37 losses - with his side scoring 407 goals over that time.\n\nIt gives him an astonishing rate of exactly two points per game and an average of little more than 1.9 goals per match when it comes to regular season league fixtures.\n\nIn 2025, history was made as Wrexham returned to the second tier for the first time in 43 years, having become the first ever team to achieve three successive promotions in the English Football League.\n\nIn preparation for the Championship Wrexham smashed their own transfer record three times last summer, with Liberato Cacace, Lewis O'Brien and then Nathan Broadhead becoming their most expensive signing upon moving to north Wales.\n\nAnd having once again strengthened in the mid-season window, Wrexham are not slowing down.\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\nDefender Cleworth is one of only two players, along with Ryan Barnett, to feature in the National League, League Two, League One and the Championship since Reynolds and Mac bought Wrexham.\n\nOn the back of signing a long-term contract extension with the club in January, the academy product said: \"Since I signed my [first] pro deal, I couldn't really have imagined to be sat here five, six years later in the Championship.\"\n\nWrexham were seventh in the National League when Reynolds and Mac were announced as the club's new owners. At present, they are sixth in the Championship - 73 places higher up the football pyramid.\n\nThe social media growth has also been vast. Wrexham had 41,000 followers on Instagram prior to the takeover, that figure has ballooned to 1.5m.\n\nBut perhaps the clearest indicator of the astronomical growth is the value of the club, which now stands at around £350m, an increase of 17,400% compared to the £2m Reynolds and Mac invested upon completing the takeover in 2021.\n\nWith a top six finish firmly within their grasp this season, the rise is showing no sign of stopping, with Cleworth aptly stating: \"It's been a hell of a ride so far, long may that continue.\"",

    "description": "Who impressed and who has the most to do after a transfixing opening weekend of the Six Nations?",
    "fullText": "France were sensational yet inconsistent, England outpowered Wales and it was very, very wet in Rome.\n\nWho impressed, and who has the most to do after a transfixing opening weekend of the Six Nations?\n\nThursday night was an unconventional starting point for the tournament, and for the first 40 minutes hosts France seemed to be playing a different sport altogether in a 36-14 win against Ireland in Paris.\n\nThe electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey scored twice but it was the way France attacked from every position - and their strength in depth - that really impressed the pundits.\n\nFrance were able to score seemingly at will, and all without all-time top try-scorer Damian Penaud - left out despite scoring 40 tries in 59 appearances for his country.\n\n\"The first-half performance from France was amazing - they blew Ireland away,\" Grand Slam winner Donncha O'Callaghan told 5 Live Sport.\n\n\"They are a level ahead of Ireland, maybe two levels. Ireland couldn't compete.\"\n\nTo Ireland's credit they did threaten a comeback in the second half but France then went again to wrap up an emphatic win.\n\nChris Ashton added on Rugby Union Weekly: \"It was magic. France can flip and flop to different styles seamlessly. There is so much you have to contend with playing against them - you don't know which fire to put out first.\n\n\"It's got to be a worry for everyone. France have so much depth - the sport is getting bigger and bigger in the country.\"\n\nCan France be stopped? They face Wales in Cardiff next Sunday.\n\nCatch up with Six Nations Rugby Special on BBC iPlayer and the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly podcast on BBC Sounds\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nIf anyone can match France for strength in depth it is England, who started their campaign by thrashing Wales 48-7.\n\nWing Henry Arundell was handed a first start for two years and promptly helped himself to a first-half hat-trick, the first treble by an England men's player since Arundell himself scored five tries against Chile at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\n\nIncredibly, it was the team's first Six Nations hat-trick since Jonny May against France in 2019.\n\nBen Earl showed some of the fluency France would admire by moving from number eight to centre late on as England showed they are continuing to move in the right direction.\n\n\"England now realise where they can be,\" former scrum-half Matt Dawson told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"Whether that's winning a Grand Slam or a World Cup, only they will know their internal targets.\n\n\"But you can see that winning a scrum is not enough, scoring a try, not enough, winning the game, not enough. They are setting their standards.\"\n\nDawson's former team-mate Paul Grayson was impressed with England's speed out of the blocks at the start of a new cycle.\n\nHe said: \"England were straight in at full tilt - they were ruthless and accurate.\n\n\"England are exciting to watch now. There are lots of moving pieces being done brilliantly well and that's why England are hard to play against now.\"\n\nTougher challenges await - and England head to Murrayfield next weekend.\n\n'The shirt used to weigh heavy - now England players double in size in it'\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nThat England visit comes at a crucial time for Scotland and their coach Gregor Townsend.\n\nHe came into the tournament courted by Newcastle Red Bulls and with question marks over his commitment to the cause.\n\nA tame display in some horrendous weather in Rome as Italy picked up a famous 18-15 win has left some calling for a change.\n\nFormer Scotland forward John Barclay told Rugby Special: \"I thought before the Six Nations that Scotland had to finish third or above.\n\n\"If they don't, which is now going to be very hard, I think it becomes a necessity to see a change.\n\n\"It's a good group of players and if you are not seeing an improvement there is an option for change. That might be the best thing for Gregor and for Scotland.\"\n\nThe conditions made the going tough, but it was Scotland's heart, not hands, that were questioned.\n\n\"Italy were more aggressive and that's down to desire, not the rain,\" former Scotland and British and Irish Lions prop Peter Wright told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"Townsend is an experienced coach and should have known they couldn't play the rugby they wanted to play in those conditions. Scotland lost the war in the set-pieces.\"\n\nThe defeat was a fifth away loss in a row in the Six Nations for Scotland and their beleaguered coach.\n\nBefore the match, Townsend - who is contracted as head coach until the end of the 2027 World Cup - dismissed a report that he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the World Cup as \"pure speculation\".\n\nMore displays like this may make that contract end date a moot point. Scotland need to dig deep and find another level of performance against England.\n\nExpect recalls for Duhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham to provide energy and - Scotland will hope - ammunition.\n\n'Townsend on the ropes after romp in swamp'\n\nI believe in what we're doing - Townsend\n\nIf that defeat left Scotland in crisis, where exactly are Wales?\n\nThrashed at Twickenham, they have now won only two of their past 24 Tests and have not won a Six Nations match since 2023.\n\nDiscipline is a major issue. Wales conceded 16 penalties against England - the most they have conceded in a Test since 2009 - and had four yellow cards, the joint most any team has been shown in a Six Nations match.\n\nBarclay said Wales' issues are mental, not technical.\n\nThey have shipped 248 points and conceded 34 tries in coach Steve Tandy's first five games in charge.\n\n\"It appears there is so much to try and fix in a week for Wales,\" Barclay said.\n\n\"First up has to be their tackling. Defence is easier to sort than attack - it's a mindset.\n\n\"The lack of intent in the tackle is something to look at. How do you fix ill-discipline? If you fix your defence and be a hard team to beat that will sort itself.\"\n\nWales won a Grand Slam as recently as 2019 and a title in 2021, but are heading towards a third consecutive Wooden Spoon. Next up? Free-scoring France on Sunday.\n\nSame old story for sorry Wales in Six Nations\n\nWe let ourselves and people at home down - Lake\n\nThe opening-day win for Italy was a 17th in the Six Nations - and ninth over Scotland.\n\nTheir best campaigns to date have featured two wins, and matching or beating that may be on the agenda.\n\nItaly's only other home game this year is against England on 7 March, but the Azzurri will surely have their eyes on a trip to Wales a week later.\n\n\"It makes you feel very confident in what you can do,\" captain Michele Lamaro said. \"So now we've got a dream in our head. We keep going on.\"\n\nIt's Ireland away on Saturday for Gonzalo Quesada's side.\n\nItaly punish lacklustre Scotland in Rome rain\n\nWho has the best record in the men's Six Nations?\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny made history with his entirely Spanish set on the sporting world's biggest stage.",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl half-time show was one big love letter to his native Puerto Rico.\n\nThe 14-minute set included guest performances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, along with cameos from the likes of Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G and Jessica Alba, who could be seen dancing on the porch of his famous casita, a staple of his shows designed to look like a traditional Puerto Rican home.\n\nIt was expected that Bad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, would use his performance as an opportunity to make a political statement against the current US administration, but instead he used it to promote a message of American unity.\n\nTransporting himself through a Latin landscape, with set pieces that included everything from a nail salon to a bar, the Grammy award winner reeled off a medley of his biggest hits, including Tití Me Preguntó, MONACO and BAILE INoLVIDABLE.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who was the world's most-played artist in 2025 according to streaming service Spotify, made history by becoming the first musician to perform a Super Bowl half-time show entirely in Spanish.\n\nBut he did choose to make two statements in English, one with a billboard message reading \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" and the other \"Together, We Are America\" written on a football that he held.\n\nHis performance at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, marked the first time the singer and rapper has performed in the United States since releasing last year's Grammy-award winning album Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos).\n\nPuerto Rico, which is a self-governing territory of the USA, was at the heart of everything in this performance, from his early emergence from a sugarcane field to a set that was meant to represent the sounds and sights of the place he calls home.\n\nFamily also featured heavily - from a young couple getting married in a crowd full of Latino dancers to the symbolic moment of Bad Bunny handing his Grammy award to a small child as his 2026 acceptance speech played on a small television.\n\nClimbing an electricity pylon - symbolising the infrastructure that was ruined during the devastating storm - and rapping at the same time, he appeared to pay tribute to the people who died in the 2017 Hurricane Maria.\n\nBad Bunny further spread a message with his outfit - wearing a beige sweater emblazoned with the number 64.\n\nIt could represent the official death toll, which turned out to be significantly lower than the estimated thousands who died.\n\nPresident Trump's administration was criticised at the time by Puerto Ricans who said it failed to provide the same federal support compared to hurricanes that had occurred on the mainland.\n\nThere were no direct criticisms of President Trump, which some saw as a surprise after his two acceptance speeches at last week's Grammy Awards, which he used as an opportunity to speak out against ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers.\n\nTheir actions have prompted protests in multiple US cities - most recently in Minneapolis, where federal agents shot and killed two Americans, leading to scrutiny of the administration's tactics.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who did not attend this year's Super Bowl, said in January that his administration would be \"reviewing everything\" after the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.\n\nIn his Grammy acceptance speech after his win for best musicá urbana album, Bad Bunny called for \"ICE out\".\n\n\"The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that's more powerful than hate is love, so, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.\"\n\nPresident Trump called Bad Bunny's Super Bowl set \"absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!\" on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nHe added that it was \"an affront to the Greatness of America\".\n\nElements of Bad Bunny's tour set, which has travelled to Central and South America and soon heads to Australia, Japan and Europe, were woven throughout Sunday's performance.\n\nThis included his casita, a house which has gone viral on social media several times for its celebrity guests.\n\nTonight was no different, with Pedro Pascal, Jessica Alba and Cardi B dancing onstage.\n\nOvercoming some early sound issues, the performer leaned heavily on hits from his most recent album, with EoO and DtMF providing some of the high points of the show.\n\nIt was not his first time on the Super Bowl stage - he made a guest appearance with Shakira in 2020 - and he brought confidence as the main star. He swaggered from one corner of the stage to the next all while delivering strong vocals.\n\nLady Gaga was on hand to bring a salsa-inspired rendition of her Bruno Mars collaboration Die With A Smile, and fellow Puerto Rican popstar Ricky Martin sang Lo Que Le Pasó A Hawaii, a song which warns Puerto Ricans to not allow their culture to be erased.\n\nBad Bunny ended his performance by shouting \"God Bless America\" in Spanish and naming multiple North and South American countries, while dancers raised flags in the background, bringing attention to the performer's refusal to bring his world tour in the US, though he did do shows in Puerto Rico.\n\nBad Bunny, who has been producing music since 2013, said in a 2025 interview with i-D that there were \"many reasons\" he would not be performing in the US this time around and \"none of them were out of hate\".\n\nSunday's show represented the best of Latin culture on the sporting world's biggest stage.",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola sends Arsenal warning as Manchester City stay in title hunt originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPep Guardiola has insisted the Premier League title race is far from over after Manchester City produced a late turnaround to beat Liverpool 2–1 at Anfield.\n\nCity were staring at a damaging defeat after Dominik Szoboszlai put the hosts ahead with a spectacular free-kick in the 74th minute.\n\nBut the champions showed their resilience late on, with Bernardo Silva drawing City level before Erling Haaland sealed the win from the penalty spot.\n\nThe victory keeps City firmly in the title conversation, although Arsenal remain in control at the summit, holding a six-point advantage.\n\nDespite the gap, Guardiola believes there is still plenty of football left to be played, with City competing across multiple competitions.\n\n\"Despite what has happened today, we have many good things to fight for. Final of the Carabao Cup, FA Cup we are there, Champions League last 16, it’s exciting,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports.\n\nMORE:Highlights and stats from Man City's win at Liverpool\n\n\"We are six points behind Arsenal, okay it is a big gap, because they don’t concede goals, they win all their games, but many things are going to happen, I guess.\"\n\nLooking further ahead, Guardiola pointed to the demanding nature of the run-in, particularly for teams balancing domestic and European commitments.\n\n\"I have a feeling that improving a little bit will not be enough to compete against Arsenal but still we have margin (to improve).\"\n\n\"We have to (play them) at home and of course we have to beat them. And I've said, 13 games in the Premier League, from my point of view, from my little experience, is a lot of time, a lot.\"\n\n\"It’s proper. When you go into the last games playing any team in a relegation battle, it’s a proper game, football game.\"\n\n\"That makes an influence in the title race, that’s why being nine, 10, 11 points is more difficult, that’s why all we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal, being there, and try if they sleep, if they make something (a mistake), use it.\"\n\nCity’s win was also notable historically, completing their first league double over Liverpool since 1937.\n\nFixtures in focus Arsenal face a challenging schedule in the coming weeks, including league trips to Brentford, Wolves and Tottenham, alongside home fixtures against Chelsea and Brighton, plus an FA Cup tie with Wigan.\n\nCity return to Premier League action with a home match against Fulham, before an FA Cup fourth-round clash with Salford City, Newcastle, Leeds and Nottingham Forest follow shortly after.",

    "description": "Derrick Barnes didn’t dominate highlight reels in 2025, but when the numbers were tallied and the film was reviewed, his season told a much louder story than the spotlight ever did.",
    "fullText": "Derrick Barnes’ 2025 season did not always come with the loudest headlines, but by year’s end it was impossible to ignore his impact on the Detroit Lions’ defense. Reliable availability, steady production and timely splash plays defined a campaign that earned Barnes a solid B grade and reinforced his value within a young, evolving linebacker group.\n\nBarnes played in every game, a significant accomplishment for a position group that has often battled attrition in recent years. That consistency alone mattered for a Lions defense that leaned heavily on continuity and trust at the second level. Availability became part of Barnes’ value, allowing Detroit to maintain its rotations and avoid scrambling for answers week to week.\n\nStatistically, Barnes delivered one of the more complete seasons of his career. He finished with 40 total tackles, four sacks and one interception. Barnes was not just a downhill run defender; he was deployed as a pressure piece, a spy and an underneath coverage defender, often within the same series.\n\nThe pass-rush production stood out most. Barnes’ four sacks placed him in rare company within the organization’s history. He became the first Lions linebacker to record at least 4.0 sacks and an interception in a single season since Chris Claiborne did it in 2002, a span of more than two decades. For a franchise that has cycled through linebacker combinations for years, that milestone carried weight.\n\nLeaguewide, Barnes’ production compared favorably as well. He and Jack Campbell each finished with 4.0 sacks, tying each other for the most sacks by any off-ball linebacker in the NFL this season. In a league where pressure increasingly comes from the edges, Barnes’ ability to affect quarterbacks from the second level added a valuable wrinkle to Detroit’s defensive front.\n\nBarnes’ interception underscored his growth in coverage. While he will never be mistaken for a true coverage specialist, his awareness improved noticeably. He showed better spacing in zone drops and a clearer understanding of route concepts developing behind him. Those gains did not eliminate all limitations, but they reduced the number of coverage mismatches opposing offenses could exploit.\n\nAgainst the run, Barnes remained a dependable presence. His 40 tackles do not jump off the stat sheet, but they reflect assignment soundness more than volume. Barnes often did the dirty work — setting edges, filling gaps and freeing up teammates to make plays. His physicality and discipline helped stabilize a defense that asked its linebackers to play fast and decisively.\n\nThe B grade reflects both achievement and remaining room for growth. Barnes was productive and dependable, but not dominant. There were stretches where his snap-to-snap impact waned, particularly against elite passing attacks that tested him in space. Continued refinement in coverage and improved play recognition could elevate him from solid contributor to difference-maker.\n\nStill, Barnes’ 2025 season marked meaningful progress. He stayed healthy, produced career-relevant numbers and etched his name into a small slice of franchise history. In a linebacker room led by Campbell and defined by versatility, Barnes proved he belongs. For Detroit, that combination of reliability and upside made his season a clear success.",

    "description": "Lacey Eden scored a goal and had two assists, and freshman goaltender Rhyah Stewart bounced back to pick up an important win for the Badgers.",
    "fullText": "MADISON – The two best teams in women’s college hockey, now depleted by the Olympics, met for the fourth time this season.\n\nBut other than that, Feb. 8 at LaBahn Arena seemed a lot like any other time when Wisconsin and Ohio State have faced off in recent years, a scrappy, grind-it-out game decided by determination, heads-up play and the right bounces.\n\nAfter a dispiriting loss a day earlier, the top-ranked Badgers got on the board first and went on to a 4-1 victory over the No. 2 Buckeyes. In the process, UW (25-3-2, 19-3-2 WCHA) won its regular seasons series, three games to one and took over the lead over Ohio State (26-4-0, 20-4-0) in the league standings with two weeks remaining before the playoffs.\n\nFifth-year right wing Lacey Eden, left off the Team USA roster for the Milan Cortina Games, needs to do more than ever for a Badgers team without five of its best players.\n\nEden scored the game’s first goal at 16:17 of the first period through a tangle in front of Ohio State goaltender Hailey MacLeod and then assisted on a breakaway by junior center Cassie Hall that made it 2-0 in the second period and on junior defender Laney Potter’s 5-on-3 goal in the third that took the lead to 3-1.\n\n“From the opening faceoff, we were here to play today,” said Eden, who was frustrated a day earlier when the Badgers seemed to be skating in quicksand. “We had that effort that we were talking about yesterday.\n\n“And just getting pucks the net, yeah, definitely the goal was to get up 1-0 and we were able to capitalize on that and I think that helped the momentum for the rest of the game.”\n\nHead coach Mark Johnson couldn’t ask for more from a player who has been an important part of the leadership group through three UW-OSU national championship battles.\n\nNow she has to step up even \n\n“Whether it’s killing a penalty and blocking a shot and what we saw in the first period, scoring a goal in the first period, making a play on the five-on-three, we keep talking, and she keeps playing well,” Johnson said. “Give her a lot of credit because if you watched her, yesterday and then watched again today, there’s a lot of determination and grit, getting knocked down and just getting back up and keep playing. Fun to watch.”\n\nThe Badgers’ fourth goal came from sophomore center Finley McCarthhy just 26 seconds after Potter’s while UW was still on the power play.\n\nOn the other end of the ice, freshman Rhyah Stewart was making her fourth start since McNaughton left for Italy. She stopped 20 shots on goal and held Ohio State 0 for 7 on the power play.\n\n“Definitely the D-zone, it’s a group effort,” Stewart said. “I just do my job to help them back there, but any help I get is always awesome.\n\n“The more reps you get at this level, it’s kind of just you get more comfortable with the speed of the game and to just kind of know the plays that might happen in front of you. So I think that helps with a lot of confidence in the net.”\n\nStewart is 2-2 in McNaughton’s absence after splits against Ohio State and at third-ranked Minnesota and 3-2 overall.\n\n“I was happy for Rhyahj,” Johnson said. “Back to back weekends against two of the top teams in the country, and she looked comfortable out there today. She looked confident and those are the things you want to see in your players, especially your young ones.”\n\nThe Badgers would love to see more of the same as the regular season winds down as they pursue an 11th regular season conference title before their Olympians return.\n\nOver the remaining two weekends they play a pair of games at Minnesota State and then host St. Cloud State at LaBahn. Both are in the bottom half of the WCHA standings.\n\nOhio State hosts Minnesota and then finishes at last-place Bemidji State.\n\nThen come the WCHA tournament and the NCAA tournament, where Wisconsin is 2-1 against Ohio State in the past three championships.\n\n“Every game you should try to hold yourself to that standard of playing it like a championship game, playing it like your last game, or however you want to think about that,” Eden said. “Against a rival like Ohio State, you need that laser focus, you need to be doing those little things. And I hope we can kind of take notes from this game and continue that into the rest of our regular season as a team.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin women's hockey beats Ohio State 4-1, retakes WCHA lead",

She was 7-for-11 from 3-point range and had seven assists.\n\nSakima Walker scored 18 points and Mjracle Sheppard had 14 points and eight assists for Cal, which was coming off a win at Georgia Tech.\n\nThe Bears (15-10, 6-6 ACC) jumped to a 54-32 halftime lead and kept a double-digit edge throughout the second half against the Panthers (8-17, 1-11) while winning for the fifth time in six games.\n\n\"I thought we came out with the right mindset, and were really good in the first half,\" Cal coach Charmin Smith said. \"Obviously, we made shots offensively and we were locked in defensively and did a really good job. We struggled to keep that momentum in the second half, but we're on the road in ACC play, so I'm happy that we got a sweep, and this helps us have momentum. … These were games that we had to win, so we took care of business.\"\n\nTheresa Hagans' 19 points led the Pittsburgh.\n\nGeorgia Tech 74, Stanford 52: In Atlanta, freshman Lara Samfai scored a season-high 19 points and Hailee Swain added 10, but the Cardinal (16-9, 5-7 ACC) were held to 33% shooting in a loss to the Yellow Jackets (11-14, 6-7).\n\nStanford trailed by six after the first quarter, then saw its deficit grow to 15 at halftime after being held to seven points in the second quarter.

    "description": "A look at what color Gatorade was dumped on the winning coach at Super Bowl 60. Did Mike Vrabel or Mike Macdonald get the bath?",
    "fullText": "Gatorade rose to prominence in the early 1990s due, in part, to a commercial titled “Be Like Mike,” featuring Michael Jordan. A quarter of a century later, two coaches named Mike are facing off on the Super Bowl stage, and there’s a great chance one of them winds up being drenched in Gatorade tonight.\n\nEither the Seahawks’ Mike Macdonald or the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel will likely get the traditional Gatorade shower tonight at Levi’s Stadium. We will post the results of the Super Bowl 60 Gatorade color as soon as the electrolytes hit the turf this evening.\n\nWe will soon have the Super Bowl Gatorade color results. Be sure to check back here immediately after the game to see which color cashed.\n\nThere is so much chaos in the closing minutes and immediate aftermath of the Super Bowl that TV cameras can often miss the Gatorade bath.\n\nThis occurred in 2021 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 in Super Bowl LV. CBS cameras missed Bucs head coach Bruce Arians getting doused, and there were many minutes of speculation online regarding which color landed on his head.\n\nA video from the stadium went viral shortly after the conclusion of the game, revealing that Arians was drenched in blue Gatorade.\n\nBlue was a favorite heading into this year’s game, as it owned +260 Gatorade color odds. Only orange had shorter odds.\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl matchup does not have much background when it comes to Gatorade baths. There is no prior video of Macdonald or Vrabel being hit with a Gatorade bath, as neither has reached the Super Bowl as a head coach before.\n\nNeither was hit with a Gatorade bath in their respective conference championship game this year, either.\n\nHere is a look at what Gatorade color payouts would look like on a $10 bet. Payouts are the total amount you would receive in return on a winning bet. So it’s the $10 you bet upfront plus the amount you actually won.\n\nYellow/Green/Lime (+260): $36.00\n\nNo Gatorade Bath (+5000): $510.00\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "The U.S. has medaled in every Winter Olympic sport, except Biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Can American biathletes end their 66-year shutout at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics?\n\nCampbell Wright offers Team USA's best shot at making a biathlon podium. The 23-year-old represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, but the dual citizenship athlete switched in 2023 to represent the U.S., where his parents were born, and won two silver medals at the 2025 World Championship.\n\nAlthough the biathlon officially made its debut at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Olympics, military patrols are a direct precursor to biathlon and date back to the inaugural 1924 Chamonix Winter Olympics. Military patrols were included in the 1928, 1936 and 1948 Winter Games as a demonstration sport, before the first biathlon was contested in 1960 with the men's 20-km event. Women's events made their debut at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games, while mixed relay was added to the program in 2014 in Sochi.\n\nAthletes strap rifles to their back and ski multiple laps around a cross-country track. After each lap, the skier arrives at a shooting zone and fires five shots at a target from either the standing position or prone position. A missed target results in a penalty: either a lap around a penalty loop or one minute added to the overall time. The winner is determined by either the first to cross the finish line or best overall time, depending on the event.\n\nThere are 11 Olympic biathlon events. Men and women have their own events and there's one mixed relay:\n\n4x6-kilometer mixed relay: Two men and two women\n\nCampbell Wright: The 23-year-old represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics before joining Team USA in October 2023. Wright became the first U.S biathlete to win two medals in a single world championship when he won back-to-back silver medals in sprint and pursuit. He's the first American to win a world championship medal since Susan Dunklee in 2020 and the first American male since Lowell Bailey's gold in the 20 km in 2017.\n\nDeedra Irwin: The 33-year-old is looking to improve on her seventh-place finish in the women's 15km individual race in Beijing in 2022, marking the best-ever Olympic finish for an American biathlete.\n\nFrance dominated the 2025 Biathlon World Championships, winning six golds and 13 total medals, the most of any country, followed by nine total medals for Norway, five for Germany and four for Sweden.\n\nFrance's Quentin Fillon Maillet became the first biathlete to win five medals in a single Winter Games after earning two golds (individual, pursuit) and three silver medals (sprint, relay and mixed relay) in Beijing in 2022. France's Julia Simon won a mixed relay silver medal in Beijing in 2022 and took home four golds at the 2025 world championships (individual, relay, mixed relay and single mixed relay).\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biathlon at 2026 Milano Cortina: How it works, U.S. stars to watch",

    "fullText": "If you were expecting a defensive affair in Super Bowl LX, the first half has lived up to the billing.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks scored a field goal on their opening drive of the game to take a 3-0 lead, but that has been half of the scoring so far as the first half of Super Bowl LX draws to a close with the Seahawks leading the New England Patriots by just 6-0 thanks to two field goals from Jason Myers late in the second quarter.\n\nSo that has us thinking: What are the three lowest scoring Super Bowls in Super Bowl history?\n\nSuper Bowl IX was played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings. Similar to Super Bowl LX, the first half of Super Bowl IX was a true defensive struggle, as the only points came for Pittsburgh on a safety when Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton was taken down in his own end zone.\n\nThe opening kickoff of the second half was fumbled by Minnesota fullback Bill Brown, giving the Steelers incredible field position. Pittsburgh capped off their next possession with a touchdown run from Franco Harris to give Pittsburgh a 9-0 lead.\n\nThe Steelers would go on to win by a final score of 16-9, for a total of 22 points.\n\nSuper Bowl VII capped off a perfect 17-0 season for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nBut interestingly enough, it might be most remembered for how Washington scored their only points of the game, coming on this botched field goal attempt from Miami.\n\nGaro Yepremian’s gaffe aside, the Dolphins took the win, and to date the only perfect season in NFL history.\n\nThat is a total of just 21 points.\n\nInterestingly enough, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history featured the Patriots as well.\n\nTom Brady’s final Super Bowl win with New England came in Super Bowl LIII against the Los Angeles Rams. While Jared Goff and company had chances, the Rams offense never found the end zone. New England scored the lone touchdown of the game on a short plunge from Sony Michel, and wide receiver Julian Edelman — who caught 10 passes for 141 yards — took home Super Bowl MVP.",

    "fullText": "Kenneth Walker's contract status and projection ahead of 2026 NFL offseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks finally turn the page to the offseason, they'll have a big decision to make on running back Kenneth Walker.\n\nThat's because the former second-round pick is a pending free agent after spending all four of his NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHere's a look at who much Walker is expected to make in free agency.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Walker is estimated to land a four-year, $33.5 million deal in free agency, which is realistic for a few reasons.\n\nFor starters, Walker will be one of the best running backs available in free agency and should draw plenty of interest. Also, Walker has only helped his contract demands with a big showing in the playoffs.\n\nWhat will hurt Walker is the fact that he isn't the most complete back. He's OK as a pass-catcher and struggles in pass protection, so he won't be getting top-of-the-market money.\n\nThe good news for the Seahawks is they are loaded with cap space this offseason, so they'll have no issue re-signing Walker if that's the route they want to go.\n\nCardinals trade rumor could lead to deal with Steelers, Vikings or Browns\n\nAaron Rodgers career update is great news for Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n49ers trade rumor is crushing blow to possible deal with Vikings, Falcons\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't ruling out interesting career change down the line\n\nTravis Kelce rumor offers update on Chiefs superstar's future plans\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor is good news for Pats, Eagles, Cowboys",

    "fullText": "Manchester City were denied a record-equalling 14 consecutive Women’s Super League wins on Sunday after a defeat to Arsenal. The Gunners puts the brakes on City’s title charge with a successful afternoon at the Emirates, thanks to Olivia Smith.\n\nA sole goal from summer signing Smith denied the Citizens from matching the competition’s longest winning streak. The decisive moment came in just the 17th minute, when Mariona Caldentey’s stunning through ball was pounced upon by the Canadian forward. Smith took the ball past Ayala Yamashita and coolly finished into the open net.\n\nThe result has little impact on the league standings, as City still remain top, eight points clear of derby rivals Manchester United. Arsenal however, have a game in-hand due to their participation in FIFA’s Champions Cup, and could close the gap to seven points if they defeat Leicester.\n\nRenée Slegers’s game plan was clear: disrupt City’s rhythm, press high in the central areas, and force defensive mistakes. The first half alone saw Arsenal have nine shots, four of these being on target. Meanwhile, City struggled linking up play between midfield and the attacking third. The away side managed just one shot on target throughout the 90 minutes, which came via Bunny Shaw moments before half-time.\n\nThe midfield partnership of Caldentey and Kim Little proved pivotal in Arsenal’s victory as Man City were forced to play wide, limiting space and time for Vivienne Miedema to dictate play much like she has this season.\n\nDefensively, the Gunners were rock solid. Daphne van Domeselaar looked calm and assured in her first start since November. While Lotte Wubben-Moy and Steph Catley marshalled their lines, limiting City’s attacking prowess.\n\nWinning the Player of the Match, Kim Little’s influence cannot be overlooked. Now 35 years old, the former Scottish international seems to get better with each passing season.\n\nLittle helped the Gunners control the tempo, disrupt City’s flow, and provide calm distribution throughout the 90 minutes. Her experience and reading of the game was pivotal in Arsenal’s dominance and shown in the second half, when a well-timed slide tackle prevented a City counter-attack and allowed the home side to calm the match.\n\nAfter the win, Arsenal’s captain spoke to SkySports and highlighted their growing momentum after recent victories against Chelsea and Corinthians.\n\n“I think we’ve obviously had quite a big week of fixtures when you look at Chelsea and then the Champions Cup last week and now going into Man City,” Little said. “We’ve put in some really great performances throughout the squad, and all the players have done really well.\n\n“We’ve raised to the occasion and obviously a huge part of that is our fans. Being able to play here in North London, to have I think close to 40,000 again today, it’s a pretty special atmosphere.”\n\nDespite trailing in the WSL standings, Little hopes her side can maintain the pressure to the final day.\n\n“I think obviously City have put themselves in a really good position, and our job now is to just push as much as we can until that end game of the season.”\n\nArsenal will hope to continue their fine winning run as they travel to Belgium to face Oud-Heverlee Leuven in the first leg of the UEFA Women’s Champions League play-offs. Having won their previous encounter 3-0, the Gunners will hope to put the tie to bed and continue their title defence.\n\nCity, however, will have five days to prepare ahead of their next league clash against bottom-of-the-table Leicester City.\n\nWSL: Sonia Bompastor extends Chelsea contract until 2030\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback\n\nWSL: Oriane Jean-François departs Chelsea and signs for Aston Villa",

    "description": "A big question at the end of the Big Game is did the Super Bowl total go Over or Under? We will have the results of how many points were scored in this update.",
    "fullText": "If it's points you crave, then this Super Bowl will likely not be for you. The 45.5-point total for Seahawks vs. Patriots is the lowest Super Bowl Over/Under in 10 years.\n\nThat said, our Super Bowl predictions won't rule out some fireworks this Sunday night at Levi's Stadium based on recent Big Game history. Each of the past three Super Bowls have gone Over the total.\n\nBelow, we will deliver the Seahawks vs. Patriots final score, and the results for whether or not the Super Bowl total went Over or Under the number.\n\nWe will post the answer to the question of whether the Super Bowl total went Over or Under as soon as the final score is set in stone.\n\nUntil then, here are some nuggets of information regarding the total for Super Bowl 60, and Super Bowl odds history.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots were both Top 10 scoring teams this season. Seattle ranked second overall in team scoring, behind only the LA Rams. Mike Macdonald’s team scored an impressive 29.2 points per game this season.\n\nNew England, meanwhile, ranked eighth in the NFL in points scored — putting up 27.2 ppg. In this year’s playoffs, the Seahawks have had a relatively easy time producing points, while it’s been a slog for the Pats.\n\nThe Seahawks put up 41 points in the Divisional Round against the 49ers, and then scored 31 points against the Rams in the NFC Championship game.\n\nMike Vrabel’s squad has had the unfortunate task of dealing with three of the top-ranked defenses in the NFL in their first three games of this postseason. The Pats scored just 16 points against the Chargers in the Wild Card round, 28 points against the Texans in the Divisional Round, and then scored only 10 points against the Broncos in the AFC Championship game.\n\nBoth the Seahawks and Patriots went Over the total in more games than not this season. The Pats have an Over record of 12-8-0 this season. Seattle, meanwhile, has an Over record of 11-8-0.\n\nDrake Maye and the Patriots have gone Under the total in two of their three playoff games played this winter. Chargers versus Patriots had a total of 45.5 and the two teams combined for just 19 points in the Wild Card round.\n\nTexans versus Patriots had a total of 40.5 points and the two teams combined for 44 points. This past round against the Broncos, the total was 42 points and the two teams combined for a measly 17 points.\n\nAs for the Seahawks, they went Over the total in each of their two playoff games this winter. Against the 49ers in the Divisional Round, the total was set at 44.5. The game went Over as the two teams combined for 48 points.\n\nIn the NFC title game, the Over/Under was 44.5 and the two teams rang up 58 points together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks lead the New England Patriots 6-0 late in the second quarter of Super Bowl LX on a pair of field goals by kicker Jason Myers.\n\nThat's a pretty low score — but it wouldn't be the lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history. It's actually three times more than the lowest halftime score in the big game's history, which came in Super Bowl IX following the 1974 season.\n\nIn a struggle between two classic NFL defenses — Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain vs. Minnesota's Purple People Eaters — the only first-half points midway through the second quarter. On second and 7 from his own 10-yard line, Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton lost the ball and had to fall on it in the Vikings' end zone. He was touched by Steelers defensive end Dwight White, who was credited with the sack.\n\nIt was the first safety ever in a Super Bowl, giving Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead that stood at halftime. The Steelers went on to defeat the Vikings 16-6 for their first of four Super Bowl wins in a six-year stretch.\n\nFollowing the 2018 season, the Patriots led the Rams 3-0 at the intermission of Super Bowl LIII, the second-lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history, on a 42-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski early in the second quarter.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "From her sudden departure from WWE to her critical takes on the American immigration enforcement crisis, Simone Garcia Johnson, known previously as \"WWE NXT\" General Manager Ava has been making headlines in the professional wrestling news cycle. The young Johnson's future extends beyond a week's worth of stories, however, and, according to Dave Meltzer, she is possibly set to delve deeper into the film industry.\n\nOn a recent episode of \"Wrestling Observer Radio,\" Meltzer delved into Johnson's departures: both from WWE, and from social media. Shortly after her WWE contract expired, Johnson took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to openly criticize United States President Donald Trump's administration, especially in regards to their controversial immigration enforcement policies. She deleted her X account not long after, and many, including Meltzer, have speculated that Johnson's anti-Trump sentiments could have contributed to her decision to not renew with WWE, a company with historical ties to Trump. However, Meltzer clarified that Ava was never officially told to delete her social media, and that her departure from X was a personal decision.\n\n\"From what I'm told, no one forced her,\" Meltzer clarified. \"But she was going to have to drop the Ava account anyway, because she's not in her contract, and [WWE owns] the name Ava.\"\n\nMeltzer also addressed Johnson's future offline. According to Meltzer, the common belief is that Johnson will work for Seven Bucks Productions, a content production company started by her father, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Seven Bucks Productions has been involved in several notable film projects, both within and outside the realm of professional wrestling, such as \"Baywatch,\" \"Black Adam,\" and \"Fighting with My Family,\" a biographical film regarding former WWE Divas Champion Paige (known also as AEW's Saraya). While the young Johnson's ties to Seven Bucks Productions is strong, her next move post-WWE remains unconfirmed.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Despite coming off a four-win season and changing head coaches a year ago, the New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl.\n\nLed by Mike Vrabel and MVP-caliber quarterback Drake Maye, they finished the regular season with a 14-3 record and as the second seed in the AFC playoff picture. As such, they went on to beat the Chargers, Texans and Broncos to punch their ticket to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThere, the NFC’s top seed awaits. The Seattle Seahawks reached the Super Bowl by going 14-3 themselves, and by subsequently beating two division rivals — the 49ers and Rams — in the playoffs.\n\nNow, the two teams meet in Santa Clara with the Vince Lombardi Trophy at play.\n\nHere are our updates live from Levi’s Stadium.\n\nSunday, Feb. 8, 6:30 p.m. ET | Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, CA | Broadcast information | Inactives | Game day roster\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Patriots won the coin toss and deferred, putting the defense on the field first to start Super Bowl 60. After a first down run by Kenneth Walker to move the chains, Sam Darnold found a pair of downfield completions to move inside the red zone. New England’s defense then held strong from there to force a field goal. [Patriots 0 : 3 Seahawks]\n\nNew England’s first drive of the day started with three straight touches for Rhamondre Stevenson, including a third-down conversion through the air. After a 12-yard scramble by Maye then set up a 3rd-and-9 after a sack, a blitz off the blindside resulted in a throwaway and punt.\n\nSeattle’s next drive started back up at their own 10-yard line. Immediately facing a 3rd-and-6, Darnold escaped a blitzing Jaylinn Hawkins but missed a wide open Jaxon Smith-Njigba downfield forcing a punt.\n\nA play-action under center pass out of six their O-line group to Kayshon Boutte started the Patriots next drive with a 21-yard gain. Two straight touches to TreVeyon Henderson then set up a 3rd-and-15, where a Seattle blitz got home again for a sack. New England then punted again.\n\nBehind another good punt by Bryce Baringer and coverage by Dell Pettus, Seattle again started inside their own 20. Two run stuffs then set up a 3rd-and-7, where a check down to Barner moved the chains. A big TFL by Craig Woodson and then a pass breakup got Seattle back into a 3rd-and-15 in which Darnold’s pass was incomplete leading to a punt.\n\nNew England continued to struggle to move the football on their next drive, as an incompletion to an open Hunter Henry was followed by a third-down run stop on Stevenson. New England punted again.\n\nFollowing a big time pass breakup downfield by Christian Gonzalez, running back Kenneth Walker found the edge to break free for 30 yards. Two plays later, Walker found running room again escaping for 29 more to move inside the red zone. With Seattle then facing a 3rd-and-12, a pitch to Walker went for a loss again thanks to Woodson. New England forced another field goal. [Patriots 0 : 6 Seahawks]\n\nWith the deficit now six, a long developing second-down sack forced the Patriots into a 3rd-and-17, where a screen to Stefon Diggs went for just five and another punt.\n\nKenneth Walker picked up a pair of first downs to get the Seahawks over midfield. A third down incompletion to Walker then forced a punt by Seattle, which was downed at the 2-yard line.\n\nBacked up on their own end zone, Maye converted a big third-down to DeMario Douglas for a nine-yard gain. Back in a third-and-long after a false start by Will Campbell, Maye uncorked one downfield in a muddy pocket that fell incomplete to Mack Hollins.\n\nWorking over midfield prior to the two-minute warning, Seattle converted a 3rd-and-2 on the ground with 32 seconds remaining. Set up with another 3rd-and-short after using their final timeouts, Darnold’s pass to JSN in the end zone was broken up and nearly intercepted by Gonzalez. New England then held to another field goal.\n\nWith six seconds left in the half, Drake Maye took a knee.",

    "fullText": "Arizona’s first season in the Big 12 Conference was an eye opener, both in terms of the significant bump in competition from the Pac-12 and the hostile atmospheres it entered. No more trips to half-empty gyms in Corvallis or Pullman, or ones in California with nearly as many UA fans as ones for the home team.\n\nTrips to Lubbock, Manhattan, Ames and Lawrence all ended badly. The opponent had a lot to do with that, but so did the crowds. All four games were sellouts, the atmospheres electric.\n\nThe second time around has been much better for Arizona (23-0, 10-0) on the road in the Big 12. It’s won at Utah, TCU, UCF, BYU and ASU, in addition to a nonconference win at UConn in November, the six consecutive road wins the longest in-season streak since 2016-17.\n\nBut now comes a trip to the last road venue that the UA lost in, Kansas’ Allen Fieldhouse. The Wildcats fell 83-76 in Lawrence to end the 2024-25 regular season, keeping Jayhawks coach Bill Self perfect on Senior Day.\n\nSelf, who is in his 23rd season at Kansas, has also never lost at home on Big Monday. He’s 38-0 , with the Jayhawks’ last Big 12 home loss on a Monday coming in 2001.\n\nBut Kansas (18-5, 8-2) has also never beaten a No. 1 team at Allen Fieldhouse, going 0-5 in such opportunities. The last was in 2003, when top-ranked Arizona came to town and won 91-74.\n\n“It’s going to be an awesome atmosphere,” UA coach Tommy Lloyd said. “And I just have a feeling those Jayhawk fans are going to be out for blood. So you know what? We’re here for it.”\n\nArizona is a 2.5-point favorite, per FanDuel Sportsbook, and if that holds it would be just the sixth time Kansas has been a home underdog since 1996.\n\nHere’s what to watch for when the UA and KU meet on Monday night:\n\nDepending on which expert you listen to, or which sportsbook you check out, the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is probably going to be one of two freshmen from the Big 12. Arizona has already faced BYU wing AJ Dybantsa, now it gets a crack at Kansas guard Darryn Peterson.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Peterson is averaging 20.5 points per game, 21.1 in Big 12 play, and makes 41.7 percent of his 3-point shots. He has scored in double figures every time out, going for 18 in 20 minutes against BYU and nailing the tying and winning 3s in the final 1:20 of a win at Texas Tech last week.\n\nBut Peterson has also missed quite a bit of time due to injury. He’s sat out 10 games, nine during nonconference play, did not play at Kansas State on Jan. 24 and a week later didn’t play the second half against BYU because of cramping.\n\nThe last two games, at Texas Tech and vs. Utah, saw him play 30-plus minutes but also post two of his lowest offensive ratings of the season.\n\nLike BYU, Kansas isn’t just its potential No. 1 pick. Three other Jayhawks average more than 14 points in Big 12 games, with guard Melvin Council dropping 36 at NC State in December scoring 22 in an OT win over TCU last month that saw his team rally from down 15 with less than five minutes to go.\n\nKansas also has the top shot blocker in the conference in 6-foot-10 sophomore Flory Bidunga. Bidunga has swatted 65 shots this season, averaging 3.8 in Big 12 play with seven against Utah on Saturday, and is shooting 78.5 percent in conference action.\n\nDepth could be an issue for Kansas, though. Only two bench players average double figures in minutes and guard Elmarko Jackson missed the last game. Self has said Jackson will play against Arizona but may not be 100 percent.\n\nBidunga and starting center Bryson Tiller, a 6-11 freshman, have been good at avoiding foul trouble but if they do get whistled there’s not much behind them to eat minutes.\n\nArizona has outrebounded every opponent this season, finishing plus-20 against Oklahoma State last time out, and is limiting Big 12 foes to boards on 25.6 percent of their misses. That’s tops in the conference, while Kansas is the worst offensive rebounding team in the league.\n\nKansas got 42 of its 71 points against Utah in the paint but also gave up 32 (of 57). The Jayhawks are +6.4 in paint points for the season, +8 in Big 12 games. Arizona, which won the paint battle 54-14 against Oklahoma State, is +19.2 in conference play.\n\nArizona may need to attempt a few more 3-pointers in this one, though, as Kansas is third-best in the Big 12 in 2-point defense. Bidunga’s shot blocking has a lot to do with that.\n\nBrayden Burries was Arizona’s leading scorer for the seventh time, fourth in Big 12 play, but for the 12th time this season the Wildcats had at least five players in double figures. Every member of the 8-man rotation has either led or tied for the lead in scoring in a game, with five different guys doing that in conference games.\n\n“I just feel like our versatility, and we know how deep we are,” Jaden Bradley said when asked about the key to Arizona’s unbeaten start. “It can be anybody’s night, the bigs, the guards, and I feel like everybody’s happy for one another. And I feel like that’s special. You don’t see that too often.”\n\nKansas could have a front row seat for another Bradley masterclass, which he’s mostly saved for ranked foes. The senior guard is averaging 19.7 points in Arizona’s six games against ranked teams, shooting 56.9 percent, and 18.8 points in Big 12 road contests.",

    "description": "The Patriots coach fell short of Canton in his first year of eligibility.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has expressed admiration for the New England Patriots dynasty in the past, so it was little surprise what he thought about Bill Belichick's Pro Football Hall of Fame snub.\n\nSpeaking with NBC News in an interview conducted Wednesday and aired on Super Bowl Sunday, the president complained about the longtime Patriots coach failing to reach Canton in his first year of eligibility:\n\n\"I thought it was terrible. I mean, he's— won so much, won so many Super Bowls. Great coach. Became a little bit controversial, I guess, after that, this little period after that. During it he was just a great coach. I thought it was very inappropriate.\n\n\"Oh yeah. It's like what have you done for me lately? Well, you know, you have a great career and he has a little bit of a controversial year and a half, two years maybe. But— what difference does that make? No, he should've— he should be in there right at the top.\"\n\nTrump is hardly the first person to rail against the snub. He refers twice to \"controversial\" actions on Belichick's part, which could be a reference to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that occurred under the coach's watch. However, he alludes to those controversial years being after Belichick's NFL career so he might simply be referring to the 73-year-old's post-Patriots UNC-Jordon Hudson era.\n\nRegardless, Belichick's snubs came down to more than controversies. As one of the few Belichick \"no\" voters laid out, the matter of voting Belichick was more than \"yes\" or \"no.\" To some, it was \"Belichick\" or \"a group of senior players who might not get another Hall of Fame shot for years.\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame's voting process created conditions in which the NFL's all-time leader in playoff wins among head coaches was put in competition for a limited number of votes with three senior players and a contributor, in this case Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nThis year, the only one of that quintet to emerge was former San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig, who was recognized on the field at Super Bowl LX alongside modern-era inductees Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri.",

    "fullText": "Who cares about the 2026 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks? Most football fans are already looking to next year, and hoping their team can make the surprising leap that New England and Seattle did this season.\n\nThe Seahawks’ were No. 19 in the preseason Super Bowl odds this season. The Patriots were No. 21 in the preseason Super Bowl odds. The NFL is king in part because almost every team starts each season with the belief that they can win the championship if everything goes according to plan. Parity is going stronger than ever in the modern game, and the 2025-26 season is all the evidence you need.\n\nIt’s never too early to look ahead to next year. Here’s every team’s Super Bowl LXI odds a year out before the game is played in SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on Feb. 14, 2027. My favorite bets are included after the table.\n\nChicago Bears (+2700): The Bears are due for some regression to the mean in terms of forcing turnovers next year. Chicago’s 22 takeaways led the league, and only Houston (17) was close, with no other team having more than 13. That’s okay: the Bears’ offense is probably due for some positive regression and additional growth from QB Caleb Williams. Williams turns 25 years old in the middle of next season as he starts Year 3 in the NFL, and he already showed massive improvement in the second half of year two. The Bears should use their available cap space to beef up the defensive front, which will hopefully make them less turnover dependent. With rookies like Colston Loveland and Luther Burden II primed to take a bigger step forward, plus a possible breakout year from Rome Odunze in his third season, the Bears should be a better offense and more sustainable defense.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (+1800): The Niners had a season from hell in terms of injuries and still had a really good year. San Francisco will be healthier coming into next season, and the injuries they had this season allowed several talented young players to get their feet wet, which should benefit them next year. Expect the Niners to be an active team in free agency after the likely release of Brandon Aiyuk. Kyle Shanahan is as good as any head coach in the NFL. There’s still blue chip talent up and down this roster. If they went 12-5 in a season where they had a lot of bad luck, I’ll bank on some positive regression next season.\n\nWashington Commanders (+4500): Jayden Daniels has looked like a superstar quarterback when he’s fully healthy, and this offseason the Commanders have the opportunity to load up on talent around him. Washington enters the offseason with the No. 7 overall pick, and tons of cap space to splurge on free agents. Edge rushers, linebackers, and secondary help could all be on the menu for a defense that struggled this season. It would also be nice to get Daniels some weapons with Zach Ertz working through a torn ACL and Deebo Samuel entering free agency. Washington needs a talent infusion, but they have the means to do it, and I like the QB/coach combo of Daniels and Dan Quinn for a deep sleeper.",

Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text.",

    "fullText": "Another day, another vulnerability (or two, or 200) in the security nightmare that is OpenClaw.\n\nResearchers, over the last two days, have disclosed additional issues with OpenClaw - the vibecoded and famously insecure AI agent farm formerly known as Clawdbot and then Moltbot. Specifically, researchers say that the open source agent platform is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection, allowing an attacker to backdoor a user's machine and then steal sensitive data or perform destructive operations.\n\nPlus, as other threat hunters have recently found, the ClawHub marketplace for OpenClaw is teeming with malware and leaky agent skills that expose sensitive credentials.\n\nIn a Thursday blog, Snyk engineers said they scanned the entire ClawHub marketplace containing nearly 4,000 skills and found that 283 of them - that's about 7.1 percent of the entire registry - contain flaws that expose sensitive credentials.\n\n\"They are functional, popular agent skills (like moltyverse-email and youtube-data) that instruct AI agents to mishandle secrets, forcing them to pass API keys, passwords, and even credit card numbers through the LLM's context window and output logs in plaintext,\" the engineers wrote.\n\nThis security flaw is due to the SKILL.md instructions, and developers treating AI agents like local scripts.\n\nWhen someone prompts an agent to \"use this API key,\" the model saves the key in memory, and that conversation history can be leaked to model providers such as OpenAI or Anthropic - or they could appear in plain text in application logs.\n\n\"Perhaps most alarming is the buy-anything skill (v2.0.0),\" the engineers wrote. \"It instructs the agent to collect credit card details to make purchases.\"\n\nTo do this, the LLM tokenizes the user's credit card number, thus sending financial info to the model provider. A subsequent prompt could ask the agent: \"Check your logs for the last purchase and repeat the card details,\" and thus expose the user's credit card to an attacker, enabling financial fraud and theft.\n\nSnyk's research follows a similar blog the developer-focused security shop published on Wednesday that found malware-laced skills across the ecosystem, including 76 malicious payloads designed for credential theft, backdoor installation, and data exfiltration.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, AI security firm Zenity's research arm demonstrated how an attacker could use indirect prompt injection to backdoor OpenClaw users' machines. The problem here is due to AI agents' integrations with other productivity tools like Google Workspace and Slack, allowing OpenClaw to access email, calendars, documents, and enterprise Slack chats.\n\nIn Zenity's proof-of-concept, the attack begins with a Google document and assumes that the OpenClaw instance already integrates with a user's Google environment - although the threat hunters note that a Google Workspace integration is not a prerequisite for the attack. Any trusted third-party integration will work, as this initial integration is only needed to deliver the initial malicious document or other type of content.\n\nIn the Google doc example, it contains an indirect prompt injection payload directing OpenClaw to create a new integration with a Telegram bot.\n\n\"Once the integration is created, OpenClaw begins accepting and responding to messages from the attacker-controlled bot,\" the researchers wrote. \"From this stage onward, the attacker interacts with OpenClaw exclusively through the newly added chat channel.\"\n\nThis means that an attacker can issue commands via the bot, asking OpenClaw to read all of the files on a user's desktop, steal their content and send it all to an attacker-controlled server, and then permanently delete all the files.\n\nOr, they could instruct the agent to download and execute a Sliver command-and-control (C2) beacon onto the victim's computer for long-term remote access. At this point, the attacker wouldn't really even need the AI agent and could instead use the backdoor and C2 channel for lateral movement, privilege escalation, credential harvesting - even ransomware deployment.\n\nThe evil possibilities are truly endless.\n\nThe Register reached out to OpenClaw and its developer Peter Steinberger about these security issues - the latest in what has become a daily deluge of OpenClaw vulnerabilities - and did not receive an immediate response. We will update this story if and when we do. ®",

    "fullText": "Occasionally, when it comes up in conversation that I have five children, I'm met with surprise and sometimes, a little bit of shock.\n\nAnd while I understand that five may seem like a lot of kids in some regards, in my neck of the woods, it's really not that uncommon. In fact, my sister-in-law has seven children, so in comparison, my brood is the small one.\n\nAll in all, with kids ranging in age from a few months to 17, my kids are a part of a close-knit cousin clan of 15 and counting.\n\nHaving a lot of cousins nearby can be costly for birthdays and the holidays, but for everyday life, the fact that my kids have those relationships truly feels priceless.\n\nI love the simple happiness my kids get from spending time with their cousins, and it feels like such a gift. In a world where it feels like everyone is trying to sell me something or make me pay for \"fun\" experiences for my kids, knowing that what they love most in the world is just being at home with their cousins feels almost too good to be true sometimes. Honestly, I wish I could recapture that level of pure joy in my own adult life again.\n\nI will be honest with you: having 10 kids in my house at once does mean I have to do a lot of post-play cleanup (and right now, we're currently cycling through a stomach bug passed along over our cousin sleepover), but it's always worth it for how much fun the kids have.\n\nAside from the sleepovers our kids can usually talk us into, having a sister-in-law with seven kids is also very convenient for me as a mom. All it takes is her family to come over for birthdays and special occasions, and we have an instant, built-in party.\n\nIt really works out for me, especially because each of my kids has an instant playmate in their cousin who is their age.\n\nFor instance, my son is the only boy in our family, but because he has two male cousins near his age, he gets the fun boy time he misses out on at home. And my youngest daughter has a large five-year gap with her own siblings, so she gets to experience the fun of playmates her age, too.\n\nMy oldest girls don't have cousins their ages, so they have missed out on some level of the cousin fun, but even as teenagers, they love all their cousins, and they have a special relationship with all the littles that is beautiful in its own way. It's so fun watching the younger girls look up to them, and my girls are always so gracious, letting the littles do their makeup and hair and playing with them when they are together.\n\nRight now, my kids are incredibly lucky with the time they get with their families. They see both sides of their families regularly, with weekly breakfasts, time at church, all holidays and special occasions, sports events, and random visits, just for fun. My husband and I both live within 30 minutes of almost all of our own siblings and parents, so to my kids, close-knit families are the norm.\n\nWhile my kids are incredibly close with their cousins right now, I know those relationships might change as they get older. People can grow apart, family members will most likely move away, and things can happen.\n\nBut no matter what their relationships look like in the future, I do believe that the close-knit relationships and the memories they are creating together will shape them. Belonging somewhere matters, both as a child and as an adult, and I hope that the feeling of being loved as part of a big family sits somewhere inside them as they grow.",

    "description": "A full-time reseller explains how years of thrifting experience helped her spot a $3,000 designer bag at a thrift store for $8.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kristen Boelen, the founder of Lunch Break Vintage. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have been thrifting since the moment I could drive. Back then, I was into higher-end things that were out of my budget, and I'd go thrift shopping to find similar items that I could afford. That habit carried on through college and beyond, including when I was most recently working as an art director for a wine and spirits company. While working there, I'd thrift on my lunch breaks.\n\nI'd find stuff for myself, as well as one-of-a-kind items that didn't fit. I wanted someone to take that stuff. So I began selling items on Whatnot.\n\nI'd thrift on my lunch break from work, and then on the weekends I'd go live and sell my pieces. My business grew from there, and I named it Lunch Break Vintage, which I began full time in February 2025.\n\nIn December 2025, I was at a thrift store in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was a normal Wednesday, which is the day this particular thrift store opens for the week, and when I always try to go. It was very empty that day.\n\nTwo woven leather bags caught my eye. You see woven leather bags all the time. There are so many Bottega Veneta dupes. I didn't really think much about it, just that one of them looked exceptionally nice.\n\nI first noticed the hardware, then the leather slouching and hanging. I could tell it was soft leather. When I picked it up, it was heavy — designer leather bags have a weight to them because of the hardware. I opened it up and saw the logo. You can see in the video that I posted that's the moment my jaw drops. The leather inside was really soft and buttery too; that's always a sign a bag is legitimate.\n\nI know they sort through and send a lot of the higher-end pieces to an online audience. It seemed unrealistic that someone wouldn't have set it aside. I thought, if they had put it out there, it must not be real.\n\nI took a photo of it and put it into Google Lens, and found on Vestaire Collective there was the exact same bag and color. That clued me into the style name and that it had been retired. There's a video of me going, \"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,\" once I figured out where the serial tag was. I got out of there as quickly as possible, paying $8 for the bag.\n\nI later had it authenticated through an app I use called Authentic Detective. It will give you a certificate of authenticity. Online research says the bag is valued at around $3,000.\n\nI'm keeping the bag for myself. It's something that will be passed down for generations. I had so many comments on the video saying that the bag was ugly, but I love it.\n\nI thrift all the time because I now do this for a living, but I think consistency is key. I thrift at least three times a week, every week. It's also important not to just pick up what is trending. A good secondhand item has to check all the boxes for me, and I really care about quality, always looking for natural fibers. I focus on what makes people feel elevated and the kinds of secondhand pieces they can keep in their closets forever.\n\nDon't believe that middle-of-nowhere places are garbage. Some of my best, coolest, most unique pieces have come from middle-of-nowhere stores.",

    "fullText": "\"Vibe-coding\" just celebrated its first birthday. That's a lifetime in the AI boom.\n\nNow, the man who coined the term is celebrating the birth of a new one: \"agentic engineering.\"\n\nWhile vibe-coding is when humans prompt AI to write code, OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy says agentic engineering is when AI agents write the code themselves.\n\n\"Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally, my current favorite is 'agentic engineering,'\" he wrote in a recent X post.\n\nKarpathy said he calls it \"agentic engineering\" not just because agents are writing the code, but because \"there is an art & science and expertise to it.\"\n\nVibe-coding is one of the biggest innovations of the AI revolution. Prominent CEOs and startup founders alike are encouraging the use of vibe-coding across their teams. And billions are being poured into new vibe-coding companies.\n\nLovable, one of Europe's fastest-growing startups, announced that it had raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation in December. Cursor, an AI-assisted code editor, announced a Series D funding round of $2.3 billion in November and said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue.\n\nThe approach is also threatening traditional engineering jobs. In a Business Insider survey of 167 software engineers, 75 engineers said that they were \"keeping up,\" while 30 said they felt ahead of the curve, and 27 felt behind.\n\n\"Vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic 'contribution,' and even its article is longer. lol,\" Karpathy wrote on X about its meteoric rise.\n\nKarpathy was a founding member of OpenAI in 2015, years before competitors like Anthropic and xAI emerged. He later moved into self-driving technology, leading Tesla's Autopilot program as head of AI. He's now building Eureka Labs, which describes itself on its website as building a \"new kind of school that is AI native.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a president repeatedly declaring inflation beaten while rarely acknowledging the strain many Americans say they still feel.\n\nIn five speeches on the economy since December, Trump asserted that inflation had been beaten or was way down almost 20 times and said prices were falling almost 30 times, assertions at odds with economic data and voters' daily experiences. Much of the remaining time was spent on grievances and other issues, including ​immigration, whether Somalia was a country, and attacks on opponents.\n\nTaken together, the speeches portray a president struggling to reconcile his central claim — that he has fixed the cost-of-living crisis — with inflation near 3% over the past year and voters’ lived experience of paying more for grocery staples. The price of ground beef, for example, ‌is up 18% since Trump took office a year ago, while ground coffee prices are up 29%.\n\nRepublican strategists told Reuters that his mixed messaging on the top issue for voters risks creating a credibility gap for him and the Republican Party ahead of the November midterms, when control of Congress will be at stake. Opinion polls show voters are deeply unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy.\n\n\"He can't continue to make claims that are demonstrably ‌false, particularly at the expense of Republicans who are in competitive House districts or Senate races,\" said Rob Godfrey, a Republican strategist. Trump \"must be disciplined and focused,\" he added.\n\nOne source close to the White House said the president needed to hit the issue of affordability harder and through personal visits to critical districts.\n\n\"He needs to bring the message out because the message is not resonating,\" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the issue.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Trump’s focus on illegal immigration in his speeches is directly connected to his argument that people in the country illegally have an adverse impact on the economy. Desai said it causes “public services being overburdened, business activity disrupted by crime, housing markets flooded, and workers’ wages depressed.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stressed that much work remains to clean up the economic mess he says his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, left him, Desai added.\n\nTRUMP VEERS OFF MESSAGE TO RAIL ABOUT IMMIGRATION\n\nThe Reuters analysis found that Trump - when not declaring inflation beaten - devoted nearly half his speaking time to grievances and other issues.\n\nIn about five hours of speaking time, he spent roughly two hours straying into ⁠about 20 topics unrelated to prices, the Reuters review found. When he veered off message, his top issue was illegal immigration, ‌which he spent a total of about 30 to 40 minutes talking about.\n\nIn the speeches he insulted Somali Americans in Minnesota, who voted against him in the 2024 election. He referred to Somalia as \"not even a country\" - and in four speeches he disparaged Somali-born Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nA progressive, high-profile Democrat and Muslim, Omar has been a frequent Trump critic, especially over his immigration policies.\n\n\"Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,\" Omar said last month, the ‍day after a man sprayed a foul-smelling liquid on her at a town hall event.\n\nTrump also talked about men in women's sports, Venezuela, Iran, the Islamic State militant group, Greenland, Ukraine and Russia, military recruitment, his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, U.S. weaponry, his exaggerated claim to have ended eight wars, and even how much a Fox News anchor likes him.\n\nTRUMP'S MEANDERING WORRIES STRATEGISTS\n\n\"Inflation is stopped. Incomes are up. Prices are down,\" Trump said in an Iowa speech on January 27.\n\nOnly twice in the five speeches did Trump acknowledge that prices are still too high, but he blamed them on Biden. Trump was elected in 2024 because of voter unhappiness with Biden's handling of inflation - which spiked to over 9% in 2022 - and illegal immigration.\n\nDemocrats caused prices \"to be too high,\" Trump told a rally ​in Pennsylvania on December 9. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nIn the same speech he called the term \"affordability\" a Democratic \"hoax\". After a public backlash, he has ceased saying that in more recent speeches.\n\nIn four of the speeches Trump repeatedly and haphazardly switches topics, often when he is in the middle of talking about the economy, the Reuters review found.\n\nFour Republican strategists ‌interviewed by Reuters said Trump's meandering style - which he proudly calls \"the weave\" - risked drowning out his core economic argument that he has brought inflation and prices down.\n\nSpeaking to world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 21, Trump spent the first 22 minutes on topic, then suddenly, for the next 22 minutes, insulted Europeans, said they would be speaking German if it wasn’t for America, called NATO ungrateful, and decried the “crooked” media before pivoting back to the U.S. economy.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said voters want to hear what Trump is doing to lower costs. \"But they have no memory of what Trump says about economic issues because of the volume of his own rhetoric.\"\n\nOne source familiar with the White House's thinking said Trump was likely to use his State of the Union address on February 24 as the kickoff for more intense domestic travel to amplify his message on affordability.\n\nFor many Americans, the economy still feels unforgiving. Prices remain high, even though the inflation rate has inched down since Trump took office, from 3% to 2.7%. A lower inflation rate does not mean prices are decreasing - just that they are growing at a slower pace, economists stress.\n\nIn the 12 months through December 2025, food costs were up over 3%, while average hourly earnings were up only 1.1% year over year. The unemployment rate was 4.4% in December, up from 4% when Trump took office in January 2025, according to government data.\n\nIn ⁠some of the speeches Trump correctly identifies a drop in prices for a few everyday goods, including eggs and gas. The cost of eggs fell about 21% in December from a year earlier after ​being 60% higher during Trump's first months back in office. Gas prices are about 4% lower since January last year.\n\nBut the cost of an average grocery basket has risen. The price of coffee, beef, and some fruits, ​among other items, has risen in the past year.\n\nTrump does offer solutions in his speeches, including his tax cuts that kicked in last month that will produce greater savings for tens of millions of families; the scrapping of taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payments; his plan to reduce mortgage interest rates; a proposal to lower housing prices; and deals with health insurance companies to reduce drug prices.\n\nMost economists expect U.S. households and the economy at large to benefit in the months ahead from the tax cuts. But Trump's more recent proposals are unlikely to have a ‍significant impact on the cost of living between now and November, some economists told Reuters. One ⁠of Trump's ideas - to cap credit card interest rates to 10% for a year - could even backfire since it could limit access to credit for lower-income families, some economists have warned.\n\nMike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports candidates for the House of Representatives, said Trump and Republicans were helping working families. \"Voters are seeing this clear contrast, and the best is yet to come.\"\n\nSome 35% of Americans approve of Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a January 25 Reuters/Ipsos poll, up slightly from 33% in December. But it is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office a year ago.\n\nFormer economic officials in previous administrations say Trump is falling into the same trap Biden did in 2024 when confronted with persistently high inflation.\n\nBiden kept claiming the U.S. economy was strong and urged voters to look at other economic data. That strategy failed badly and Democrats were punished at the polls.\n\nThe officials agreed it was important for presidents to show voters they understood their economic pain, especially in an election year.\n\n\"We ‌definitely talked past people on inflation,\" Jared Bernstein, the head of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.\n\n\"What we typically did was to say, 'A new report just came out on jobs, it's very strong,' and that was all true. But the fact is that there wasn't much we were ‌able to do in terms of the price level.\"",

    "fullText": "Christina Mann moved from Cleveland, Texas, to the small community of Point Blank four years ago when she retired. She wanted to retire close to the water, a dream of hers. Now, water is the nightmare that's keeping her from making ends meet.\n\nEvery other day, Mann drives several miles to a friend's house to fill five-gallon jugs from a garden hose. That water is what she uses to wash dishes, wash her hands and flush her toilets — her only supply after she decided last November to disconnect her water service entirely.\n\n\"I choose to eat, and I told them that every time you go up, that takes out of my money a month for my food,\" Mann told ABC13's 13 Investigates (1).\n\nMann lives alone on a monthly Social Security check she budgeted carefully around when she retired. There was enough to cover her bills, but barely. When the base fees charged by her provider — a for-profit company called Texas Water Utilities — kept climbing, she felt cornered. A termination notice arrived, and she didn't fight it. \"You don't need to send me one. Just come cut my water off. I can't afford it,\" she said.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAccording to a copy of Mann's bill reviewed by 13 Investigates, she was charged $169 for a month in which she used just 2,000 gallons. In July, the fees alone — base charges for water and sewage, pass-through fees and a state fee — totaled $150.18. Her actual water and sewage usage that billing cycle came to $9.34.\n\nThat means roughly 94% of her bill had nothing to do with how much water came out of her faucet.\n\nMann said she could manage if her bill were closer to the roughly $60 a month she paid back in Cleveland.\n\nMann's provider, Texas Water Utilities, is an investor-owned utility — a for-profit company, not a city-run system. Texas Water Utilities serves about 60,000 customers in 32 counties, is acquiring at least four other companies, and has filed to tack on a $34-per-month \"system improvement charge\" to recoup more than $80 million in infrastructure spending.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan's volatile financial markets must now contend with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi firmly in the driver's seat after her decisive victory on Sunday, which hands her an electoral mandate to reflate the economy.\n\nThe question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously.\n\nHow has the Takaichi trade impacted Japanese markets?\n\nWhy are investors concerned about Japan's debt burden?\n\nHow might Takaichi's electoral victory affect policy direction?\n\nWhat are Takaichi's key economic stimulus policies?\n\nSince she began her rise to become the nation's first female premier in October, the \"Takaichi trade\" has pushed domestic shares to record highs while causing a precipitous selloff in Japanese government bonds ‌and the yen.\n\nVoters braved heavy snowfalls in Tokyo and other parts of Japan to deliver what exit polls indicated to be the most decisive win for Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party since 1996.\n\n\"The stock market is a true believer in Takaichi, so the big win is going to be good news for equities when the markets open on Monday,\" said Chris Scicluna, the head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.\n\nTakaichi, a devotee of the \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies of the late premier Shinzo Abe, has ⁠pledged a proactive fiscal policy funded largely through bond ‌issuance.\n\nShe came to office at a low point in power and popularity for her Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-World War Two period, forcing her to bargain with opposition parties with even more liberal fiscal ‍platforms.\n\n\"The administration's foundation will become much more stable, making it easier for expectations to build around advancing economic policy,\" said Kota Suzuki, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management. \"Because there will no longer be a need to actively seek the opposition's cooperation, there will be less pressure for giveaway-style fiscal expansion.\"\n\nWith polls already indicating a decisive LDP win, Japan's benchmark ​Nikkei 225 Index set an all-time high of 54,782.83 on Tuesday. Big winners of late include sectors like defence, artificial intelligence and chips that ‌have been singled out by Takaichi for targeted investment.\n\nBut prospects for more government outlays have unsettled investors already concerned about Japan's debt burden, the largest in the developed world. Those worries came to a head on January 20, when rates across the JGB yield curve shot to multi-decade or even record highs after Takaichi called for the snap election and embraced suspending the sales tax on food.\n\nThe yen has also been punished, losing about 6% against the dollar since Takaichi's selection as prime minister in October and plumbing record lows against the euro and Swiss franc. Only threats of joint currency market intervention with the United ⁠States have arrested the yen's slide.",

    "fullText": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro, asking residents if they still supported the party that has run the country for nearly 20 years. The result: about half of members said they no longer did.\n\n“The response is very bad,” said a person who helped lead the effort. “There is division among us.”\n\nWhile Reuters was not able to independently verify the canvassing results, the reported drop in support aligned with ​information gathered from three other parts of the country.\n\nThe news agency spoke to 13 party members or local leaders across four states who reported fractures in the United Socialist Party (PSUV) following the U.S. attack. All of them expressed a deep sense of uncertainty and many voiced worries about their economic future.\n\nThe government’s ‌patronage system, which bought a form of party loyalty through financial benefits and food parcels, also appears to be under pressure, with five of the sources saying some contributions had stopped since Maduro’s capture.\n\nSix of the people described distrust among party loyalists and spreading suspicion of interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Eight said they had seen a drop in participation and support at their local party branch, with two of them estimating a ‌70% fall in attendance at events like marches and local assembly meetings.\n\nThe people Reuters spoke to all requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, with several saying local leaders were encouraging the party faithful to snitch on any members losing faith in the cause, a common tactic for weeding out popular dissent in Venezuela. Reuters has withheld the names of the people it interviewed to protect their safety.\n\nThere are no recent public numbers on party membership and while Reuters talked to people observing falling participation in four geographically dispersed states, the news agency could not determine what the situation was across all 24 states in the country. Most foreign media do not have permanent staff in the country and Venezuelans are generally reluctant to speak freely with reporters because of potential reprisals.\n\nNeither the Venezuelan government nor PSUV responded to Reuters requests for comment on the eroding support for the party and the fraying of its patronage system.\n\nCalls for national unity in the face of threats to Venezuela have been a constant in Rodriguez’s speeches and public appearances since Maduro's removal, and she has also cheered the resilience of the ⁠country's people and pledged economic development for all.\n\nDespite decrying Maduro’s detention as a kidnapping, Rodriguez appears to be complying with ‌U.S. demands to open the country to American oil companies and has also met with the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to discuss cooperation against drug trafficking.\n\nFraying party support at the grassroots level would be a problem for Rodriguez. Reuters has previously reported how she is already battling to shore up her rule by putting allies in positions of power to shield herself from the potential threat posed by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who also heads the PSUV and has close connections to the security services and colectivos - the hardline motorcycle-riding ‍enforcement arm of the party.\n\nPublicly, Cabello has stressed unity. On Jan. 12, he used his weekly press conference as party leader to emphasize Rodriguez has \"all the support of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.”\n\nNeither U.S. President Donald Trump nor Rodriguez has seriously addressed the question of elections since Maduro’s ouster, but the anecdotal dwindling of local support appears to point to an uncomfortable truth for the PSUV: Maduro’s exit has done little to improve popularity, according to the party members Reuters interviewed.\n\nA local party leader in the northern state of Aragua said the party had no way to grow or ​win elections, “even if we had Che Guevara or Gandhi as a candidate.\"\n\n“You have a situation where the apparatus of repression is fragmenting and on top of that the remaining grassroots base is demobilizing. That’s a huge challenge for governability,” said Ricardo Rios, head of Caracas-based analysis and consultancy firm Poder & Estrategia.\n\nStill, local support for the party ‌may revive. Venezuela has already received $500 million from crude sales and any significant economic improvement could help boost funding of the party and get membership perks, which have historically helped buttress support, flowing again.\n\nIn response to Reuters questions about the problems facing the Socialist Party, a senior White House official said: “The country is stable, illegal migration has stopped, drug flows have halted, and the new oil deal will generate economic prosperity for both the Venezuelan and American people.\"\n\nAll of Venezuela's top officials are long-time members of the PSUV. The party was created in 2007 by merging the disparate political and social forces that swept socialist President Hugo Chavez to power in 1999. That movement also came to bear his name - ‘Chavismo.’\n\nThe reasons given for falling local support varied. Some said people were wary of being associated with the party if the opposition were to win power, fearing some form of retribution. Others said uncertainty was causing infighting in ⁠the party. Nearly all spoke of disillusionment and questioned the loyalty of the new leadership to the Chavista cause.\n\nAdding to people’s hardship are problems with the delivery of party handouts, both food and ​financial, that have hit local branches, five sources said. They said members in three states - Zulia, Aragua and Falcon – were deserting the party because the government had stopped making bonus payments and distributing welfare. Reuters ​was not able to independently verify the information it gathered about stalling handouts.\n\nGovernment payments, which through various different benefits can for some add up to over $100 a month, are a vital income for millions in Venezuela, where the monthly minimum wage is less than $1 and poverty is rampant. Inflation is also estimated by analysts to have topped 400% in 2025.\n\nThe complexity of Venezuela's welfare system, with an array of benefits delivered at different times to different people, meant Reuters was unable to get a complete picture of the status of all payments and food ‍parcels, with some of those interviewed saying certain bonuses were still arriving while others were ⁠not.\n\nOne source in Zulia state said that in their district 600 people had not received their “family bonus”, a direct welfare payment of up to $65 given to help with living costs. Three sources also reported that food parcels, known as CLAP, have not been delivered, with some adding that problems with these deliveries predate the capture of Maduro but have continued since.\n\nIn the municipality of Mara, in the northwest border with Colombia, one party member said there were old-school Socialist Party members still committed to the cause and “clapping like seals” but that even they are “turning because they haven't been paid their bonuses.\"\n\nAbout 70% of local party members and ⁠public employees in Mara ignored calls to participate in two recent pro-Maduro marches, the person said, leading bosses to threaten people with firings. Reuters could not establish the size of the marches or if there were any firings as a result.\n\nFour of the people Reuters spoke to reported that even the motorbike-riding ‘colectivos’ were attending fewer events and have not been mobilized to push people into public support of the government. Their ‌members have been responsible for killing opposition figures and anti-government protesters, according to reports, which Reuters has not independently confirmed, from organizations like Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe person in Mara said many colectivo members are now working as motorbike taxi drivers, failing to show up to marches despite threats from ‌local authorities to revoke their mototaxi work permits, the person said. \"They hide, they fake an illness and a few have gone to Colombia.\"",

    "title": "NASA's Artemis II Spacesuits Still Have One Big Problem, According To Former Astronauts",
    "description": "As NASA prepares to kick off the Artemis missions, experts have noticed a potentially dangerous issue with a crucial component: the newly designed spacesuits.",
    "fullText": "You would think that NASA has everything ironed out for its biggest mission series yet: the Artemis missions, which will eventually send a crew of astronauts to the lunar surface. But as Artemis II gears up to launch and the rocket is prepared for takeoff, NASA is still adapting, though not necessarily for the better.\n\nFor example, the Artemis II Orion craft had a potentially dangerous flaw that saw NASA adjusting its reentry trajectory to address it. That flaw was originally discovered during the Artemis I mission, when the craft's heat shield saw char loss. Meanwhile, the new spacesuits pose another big problem: They will reportedly be heavier and bulkier than those worn during the Apollo missions (dubbed the Armstrong spacesuit). After over half a century, the astronauts will be wearing suits that have taken a step backwards in the heft department. It may not seem concerning since they'll be bouncing around in zero gravity, but former astronauts put that idea to bed. Being on the moon will actually create \"extreme physical stress\" on the astronauts for several reasons.\n\nKate Rubins, former astronaut and professor of computational and systems biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, explains that during a moonwalk, physical stress is elevated. For starters, \"people are going to be sleep shifting,\" which means they'll barely rest. Moreover, the astronauts will be wearing the suits for up to nine hours and doing EVAs (extravehicular activities or spacewalks) every day. According to Rubins, the spacewalks she did outside the ISS were like doing multiple marathons in succession.\n\nAs Rubin explains, the Axiom commercial suits (aka the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or AxEMU) will create added physical exertion and stress during the moonwalks. Not exclusively from the suits, but also equipment astronauts will be wearing and carrying, like a heavy life support backpack. The suits weigh over 300 pounds in Earth's gravity, though due to the lower gravity — about 1/6 of Earth's — they're lighter on the lunar surface. They'll still be heavier than the original 185-pound Armstrong suits. Each astronaut will also have to contend with the weight of the suit, the equipment, and their body mass collectively. Artemis III will not have a rover, either, so astronauts will be taking all physical exertion upon themselves to move equipment, tools, and other gear.\n\nThe AxEMU suits do a lot of things right, per official descriptions. They're safer and built to last generations, and they offer a custom fit for everyone. NASA and the Artemis astronauts promote the increase in mobility the Axiom suits offer. With a lot of those improvements thanks to the rear-entry design. Astronauts can get in and out themselves without help. Moreover, the suit is engineered for planetary or surface walks, which means support for legs, more upper mobility, and modular support to bring various tools.\n\nEven so, the weight may pose a challenge bigger than anyone is expecting. Former astronaut Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt, from the Apollo 17 mission, once remarked he would have designed suits to have \"four times the mobility, and half the weight.\" The AxEMU may have more mobility, but it's also heavier. We'll know soon enough how it works out, as NASA is already building the Artemis 3 rocket, which will fly after Artemis II's loop around the moon.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI collected ample proof that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused underage girls but found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men, an Associated Press review of internal Justice Department records shows.\n\nVideos and photos seized from Epstein’s homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn’t depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.\n\nAn examination of Epstein’s financial records, including payments he made to entities linked to influential figures in academia, finance and global diplomacy, found no connection to criminal activity, said another internal memo in 2019.\n\nSummarizing the investigation in an email last July, agents said “four or five” Epstein accusers claimed other men or women had sexually abused them. But, the agents said, there “was not enough evidence to federally charge these individuals.”\n\nThe AP and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential, that the Justice Department released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and it is possible those records contain evidence overlooked by investigators.\n\nHere are takeaways from what the documents show about the FBI investigation and why U.S. authorities ultimately decided to close it without additional charges.\n\nThe Epstein investigation began in 2005, when the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported that she had been molested at the millionaire’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. Then-Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta struck a deal letting Epstein plead guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. Sentenced to 18 months in jail, Epstein was free by mid-2009.\n\nIn 2018, a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea deal prompted federal prosecutors to take a fresh look at the accusations.\n\nEpstein was arrested in July of 2019. One month later, he killed himself in his jail cell.\n\nA year later, prosecutors charged Epstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, saying she’d recruited several of his victims and sometimes joined the sexual abuse. Convicted in 2021, Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term.\n\nLack of evidence for coconspirators\n\nProsecution memos, case summaries and other documents made public in the department’s latest release of Epstein-related records show that FBI agents and federal prosecutors diligently pursued potential coconspirators. Even seemingly outlandish and incomprehensible claims, called in to tip lines, were examined.\n\nSome allegations couldn’t be verified, investigators wrote.\n\nIn 2011 and again in 2019, investigators interviewed Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who in lawsuits and news interviews had accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with numerous men, including Britain’s former Prince Andrew.\n\nInvestigators said they confirmed that Giuffre had been sexually abused by Epstein. But other parts of her story were problematic.\n\nGiuffre acknowledged writing a partly fictionalized memoir of her time with Epstein containing descriptions of things that didn’t take place. She had also offered shifting accounts in interviews with investigators, they wrote.\n\nTwo other Epstein victims who Giuffre had claimed were also “lent out” to powerful men told investigators they had no such experience, prosecutors wrote in a 2019 internal memo.\n\nInvestigators seized a multitude of videos and photos from Epstein’s electronic devices and homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They found CDs, hard copy photographs and at least one videotape containing nude images of females.\n\nNo videos or photos showed Epstein victims being sexually abused, none showed any males with any of the nude females, and none contained evidence implicating anyone other than Epstein and Maxwell, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey wrote in an email for FBI officials last year.\n\nHad they existed, the government “would have pursued any leads they generated,” Comey wrote. “We did not, however, locate any such videos.”\n\nInvestigators who scoured Epstein’s bank records found payments to more than 25 women who appeared to be models — but no evidence that he was engaged in prostituting women to other men, prosecutors wrote.\n\nProsecutors weighed the possibility of charging some of Epstein’s close associates, including an assistant and business clients, but ultimately decided against it because of lack of evidence.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in February 2025 that Epstein’s never-before-seen “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now.” But FBI agents wrote superiors saying the client list didn't exist.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2024, about three weeks before President Joe Biden left office, then-FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate reached out through subordinates to ask \"whether our investigation to date indicates the ‘client list,’ often referred to in the media, does or does not exist,” according to an email summarizing his query.\n\nA day later, an FBI official replied that the case agent had confirmed no client list existed.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2025, two days before Bondi’s Fox News appearance, an FBI supervisory special agent wrote: “While media coverage of the Jeffrey Epstein case references a ‘client list,’ investigators did not locate such a list during the course of the investigation.”\n\nAaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___ The AP is reviewing the documents released by the Justice Department in collaboration with journalists from CBS, NBC, MS NOW and CNBC. Journalists from each newsroom are working together to examine the files and share information about what is in them. Each outlet is responsible for its own independent news coverage of the documents.",

    "fullText": "Ireland captain Paul Stirling says his side lacked a cutting edge in vital periods of the game as they lost by 20 runs to co-hosts Sri Lanka in the T20 World Cup Group B opener.\n\nIreland dropped five catches and leaked late runs in Colombo as Sri Lanka made 163-6, and they were going well at 105-2 before collapsing to 143 all out.\n\n\"We thought they got 15-20 [runs] too many. At the start of the day we'd be happy chasing 160,\" said Stirling.\n\n\"When the match was on the line we weren't as clinical as we wanted to be. A little bit sloppy in the field which is disappointing.\n\n\"Experience told. The Sri Lanka team at the end of both innings, that was the difference really.\n\n\"Those 20 runs - they defended well at the back end. We had plenty of wickets in hand, thought we were in good positions the whole way through and they really upped the ante and put the squeeze on.\n\n\"You can sit back and reflect and pick those 20 runs out of anywhere. They were 20 runs better than us throughout the whole match.\"\n\nAustralia are Ireland's next opponents on Wednesday as they chase a top-two finish to secure a place in the Super 8s.\n\nSpin dominated in Sunday's encounter at the R Premadasa Stadium and Stirling believes that could continue in the tournament.\n\n\"I think spin is going to be a challenge in this competition.\n\n\"Certainly, it wasn't coming onto the bat as much as it could have been. Spin is going to be dominating phases of this game.\"",

    "description": "A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimi...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimination status.\n\n“Take the vaccine, please,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator whose boss has raised suspicion about the safety and importance of vaccines. “We have a solution for our problem.”\n\nOz, a heart surgeon, defended some recently revised federal vaccine recommendations as well as past comments from President Donald Trump and the nation's health chief, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the efficacy of vaccines. From Oz, there was a clear message on the measles.\n\n“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”\n\nAn outbreak in South Carolina in the hundreds has surpassed the recorded case count in Texas’ 2025 outbreak, and there is also one on the Utah-Arizona border. Multiple other states have had confirmed cases this year. The outbreaks have mostly impacted children and have come as infectious disease experts warn that rising public distrust of vaccines generally may be contributing to the spread of a disease once declared eradicated by public health officials.\n\nAsked in the television interview whether people should fear the measles, Oz replied, “Oh, for sure.” He said Medicare and Medicaid will continue to cover the measles vaccine as part of the insurance programs.\n\n“There will never be a barrier to Americans get access to the measles vaccine. And it is part of the core schedule,” Oz said.\n\nBut Oz also said “we have advocated for measles vaccines all along” and that Kennedy “has been on the very front of this.”\n\nQuestions about vaccines did not come up later in a Kennedy interview on Fox News Channel's “The Sunday Briefing,” where he was asked about what kind of Super Bowl snack he might have (probably yogurt). He also he eats steak with sauerkraut in the mornings.\n\nCritics of Kennedy have argued that the health secretary's longtime skepticism of U.S. vaccine recommendations and past sympathy for the unfounded claim that vaccines may cause autism may influence official public health guidance in ways contrary to the medical consensus.\n\nOz argued that Kennedy's stance was supportive of the measles vaccine despite Kennedy's general comments about the recommended vaccine schedule.\n\n“When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, get your vaccines for measles, because that’s an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against,” Oz said.\n\nThe Republican administration last month dropped some vaccine recommendations for children, an overhaul of the traditional vaccine schedule that the Department of Health and Human Services said was in response to a request from Trump.\n\nTrump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While federal requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nU.S. vaccination rates have dropped and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nKennedy's past anti-vaccine activism\n\nKennedy's past skepticism of vaccines has come under scrutiny since Trump first nominated him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation testimony last year, Kennedy told lawmakers that a closely scrutinized 2019 trip he took to Samoa, which came before a devastating measles outbreak, had “nothing to do with vaccines.”\n\nBut documents obtained by The Guardian and The Associated Press undermine that testimony. Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations said that Kennedy sought to meet with top Samoan officials during his trip to the Pacific island nation.\n\nSamoan officials later said Kennedy’s trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists before the measles outbreak, which sickened thousands of people and killed 83, mostly children under age 5.\n\nMixed messaging on autism, vaccines\n\nOz's comments mark a broader pattern among administration officials of voicing discordant and at times contradictory statements about the efficacy of vaccines amid an overhaul of U.S. public health policy.\n\nOfficials have walked a fine line in criticizing past U.S. vaccine policy, often at times appearing to express sympathy for unfounded conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists, while also not straying too far from established science.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing Tuesday, Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said no single vaccine causes autism, but he did not rule out the possibility that research may find some combination of vaccines could have negative health side effects.\n\nBut Kennedy, in Senate testimony, has argued that a link between vaccines and autism has not been disproved.\n\nHe has previously claimed that some components of vaccines, like the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, may cause childhood neurological disorders such as autism. Most vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella do not contain thimerosal. A federal vaccine advisory board overhauled by Kennedy last year voted to no longer recommend thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nAdministration public health officials often cite the need to restore trust in public health systems after the coronavirus pandemic, when vaccine policy and the general public health response to the deadly pandemic became a highly polarizing topic in American politics.\n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories about the public health system also spread during the pandemic, and longtime anti-vaccine activist groups saw a swell in interest from the wider public.\n\nKennedy, who for years led the anti-vaccine activist group Children's Health Defense, has been criticized for ordering reviews of vaccines and public health guidelines that leading medical research groups have deemed settled science.\n\nPublic health experts also criticized the president for making unfounded claims about highly politicized health issues. During a September Oval Office event, Trump asserted without evidence that Tylenol and vaccines are linked to a rise in the incidence of autism in the United States.",

    "fullText": "After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.\n\nMany stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.\n\nMillions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.\n\nAnd many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US President Donald Trump will not be one of them.\n\nThe Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.\n\nThe Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.\n\nLed by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.\n\nThis is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has reached his first Super Bowl in his first season with Seattle, whose fearsome defence is led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nMany of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.\n\nPuerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.\n\nHe will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years. He is also an actor, has hosted Saturday Night Live and been a WWE 24/7 champion.\n\nRock band Green Day, who are from California, will play an anniversary ceremony before Sunday's game and the NFL has teased that there will be some surprises at half-time.\n\nBad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of President Trump, and Bad Bunny's selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles.\n\nThe controversy even led conservative group Turning Point USA to plan an alternative half-time show, which will star singer and Trump ally Kid Rock.\n\nBad Bunny says he's losing sleep over the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend America's biggest game last year, but he said this year's on the west coast is \"just too far away\".\n\nAsked about the selection of Bad Bunny and Green Day, Trump added:, external \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he avoided the US on his current world tour because of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nThere were fears there would be raids around the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, plus further protests after two people were shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\nBut, speaking on Tuesday, the NFL's chief security officer Cathy Lanier said that no ICE operations are scheduled around any of the many Super Bowl events.\n\nShe added that the Department of Homeland Security sends a variety of different agencies to the Super Bowl, which it ranks as a tier-one event, and ICE is not one of them.\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough Sunday's game will take place at the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium is 45 miles south of the Golden Gate Bridge in Santa Clara.\n\nWhile San Francisco has been the main hub during Super Bowl week, events and parties have been spread around the Bay Area, beginning with Opening Night in San Jose on Monday.\n\nActor Jon Hamm hosted the NFL's end-of-season awards night on Thursday, which was attended by Steve Irwin's son Robert, who earlier in the day took a snake into the media centre to help promote the first NFL game in Melbourne later this year.\n\nShaquille O'Neal hosted a party on Friday while Post Malone held a free concert, with artists as diverse as Olivia Dean, Shaboozey, Sting, Calvin Harris, Zach Bryan and Teddy Swims playing at other events.\n\nCardi B also performed on Saturday before watching her partner Stefon Diggs play for the Patriots on Sunday, when Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones are also among the gameday performers.\n\nOther visitors include Roger Federer, Jay-Z, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and Paris St-Germain owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\n\nWahlberg's fellow New England fan Jon Bon Jovi will introduce the Patriots players on Sunday, with actor Chris Pratt, a Seattle supporter, doing the honours for the Seahawks.\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

    "fullText": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's \"tremendous coldness\" was described as \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it may have been hard to imagine her returning to her sport's biggest stage.\n\nFour years later, the highly successful coach is at Milan-Cortina - and not everyone is happy about it.\n\nTutberidze and her training methods were under the spotlight at Beijing 2022 amid the Kamila Valieva doping scandal that rocked the Games, and it was the then-IOC president Thomas Bach who gave the stinging assessment of the coach.\n\nRather than comforting 15-year-old gold medal favourite Valieva when she left the ice in tears after falling several times, Tutberidze had instead asked the youngster \"why did you stop fighting?\"\n\nBach said he had been \"very, very disturbed\" by what he had seen and that it did not give him \"much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past, nor as far as it concerns the future\".\n\nWell, that future is here and so too is Tutberidze.\n\nNot only is Tutberidze back at the Olympics, but she is apparently coach to another Russian teenage medal hope.\n\nThat skater is 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, who is here as a neutral athlete (AIN) as Russia's team are banned from the Games because of the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Tutberidze is not officially listed as the teenager's coach in the media guide for these Games and it remains to be seen whether she will be at rinkside when Petrosian competes.\n\nWhoever she is with, there will be many eyes on Tutberidze, with the shadow of Valieva and Beijing 2022 set to loom large.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nTutberidze's official coaching role is with the Georgia figure skating team and she was at Milano Ice Skating Arena for the team event to watch one of her longest-serving pupils, Nika Egadze.\n\nEgadze stormed to victory at the 2026 European Championships in Sheffield, where Tutberidze shared a warm hug with her skater after a gold medal-winning performance, and other athletes spoke positively about the coach.\n\nIt was a different story at Milano Ice Skating Arena as Egadze endured two error-strewn routines, with Georgia missing out on a medal.\n\nIn the short programme he made two early errors, failing to land the triple toe loop in his first technical element.\n\nAs he continued his performance, the TV cameras caught Tutberidze in passing - standing at rinkside, arms folded.\n\nEgadze did enough to pull the performance around and help earn Georgia fifth place in qualifying, progressing to the final. When he came off the ice, the hug from Tutberidze seemed curt.\n\nShe joined the Georgian squad as they waited for the results. Generally, waiting teams will laugh and joke, even if they know elimination is coming.\n\nInstead, the 11 skaters and team members sat stony-faced as the scores were announced.\n\nIf this was an indicator of the atmosphere in the team, it is certainly not positive, but it may have just been a moment of nervous focus.\n\nPerhaps Tutberidze was minding her body language on Sunday as Egadze struggled even \n\nHis coach gave him a pat on the hand as the numbers came in. Despite Egadze scoring only 154.79 for the free skate - 27 points lower than his season best - there was no berating.\n\nThe attention comes at a Games which began for Georgia with their team being roundly booed in San Siro when they entered the stadium during the opening ceremony.\n\nOfficial views on Tutberidze's presence in Milan vary.\n\nGiven she has not been personally implicated in any doping scandals and has not broken any rules, Tutberidze has every right to be at the Olympics.\n\nShe has rejected any suggestions of wrongdoing in her career as a coach and said in 2022 she was baffled by Bach's remarks.\n\n\"There was an investigation at the time and no issues were found that could be actioned against that individual,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a media conference on Sunday.\n\n\"If you are going to take action against someone, you need evidence, and from what I gather there isn't any.\"\n\nHowever, World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) president Witold Banka said on Thursday he does not \"feel comfortable with her presence here\",, external while Britain's 1980 Olympic champion and BBC pundit Robin Cousins was unequivocal in his disdain.\n\n\"This comes down to the International Olympic Committee and International Skating Union - coaches are not part of the team,\" Cousins told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So when they ban a team, the coach of said team is not part of that. That is not correct, as far as I am concerned. I would not have her anywhere near Milan, personally.\n\n\"Is that because of behaviour, or Russia being banned? All of the above.\n\n\"The way we watched everything unfold, someone has to take the blame. Any skater would say the most important person is the coach; you trust them, you give yourself to them. That is not how you treat a student.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, a television documentary - The Tutberidze Method - was released in Russia, celebrating her track record in training medal winners.\n\nTwo of Tutberidze's skaters have won women's gold and silver medals at the past two Olympics, but both were amid drama.\n\nAs the Valieva saga played out, Beijing 2022 champion Anna Shcherbakova was left barely celebrating victory – later saying she felt \"emptiness\" – while silver medallist Alexandra Trusova was so disappointed to miss out on gold that she said before the medal ceremony that she never wanted to skate again.\n\nFour years before that, in 2018, favourite Evgenia Medvedeva was sobbing after being upstaged by 15-year-old training partner Alina Zagitova.\n\nIn the run-up to those two Games, Tutberidze's skaters had been hot favourites, dominating the World Championships and European Championships.\n\nLittle has been seen of Petrosian recently on the international stage because of Russia's ban from competition. The only real sighting of her was at September's qualifying event in Beijing, where she won gold, but not all the top skaters were there.\n\nPetrosian has also won the past three national championships – making it 11 years in a row for Tutberidze skaters – and she is the first woman to land a quadruple loop in competition, but she was injured last year and has struggled with errors this season.\n\nFollowing the Valieva episode, the minimum age for competitors was raised from 15 to 17, an age that has not been far off retirement age for some of Tutberidze's skaters in the past because of a combination of injury and a drop in technical skills.\n\nIt has been reported that her training model centres around female skaters peaking before they hit puberty., external\n\nItalian Daniel Grassl, who went to work with Tutberidze in Moscow in 2023, described her as a \"very good\" coach, adding: \"She can be a little bit cold but she was warm with us, and was supporting us.\"\n\nValieva, a mercurial talent who performances drew worldwide attention, was eventually banned for four years over her failed drugs test, but there were no sanctions for any of her entourage.\n\nHer team have always insisted the failed test - for heart medication trimetazidine - was the result of contaminated cutlery which had been tainted by her grandfather's medication, while Wada called for those behind the failed test to face justice because \"the doping of children is unforgivable\".\n\n\"Wada is not behind the decision to accredit the coach [for Milan-Cortina],\" Banka said. \"The investigation found no evidence this person [Tutberidze] engaged in the topic, so there is no legal basis to exclude her.\"\n\nValieva, now 19, has only just returned to skating, finishing sixth in the semi-finals of the Russian Jump Championships last week. She is no longer coached by Tutberidze.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has not had many tougher weeks in her managerial career and was defiant following their win at Tottenham.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has not had many tougher weeks in her managerial career.\n\nHaving fallen 12 points adrift of Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Manchester City, suffering back-to-back defeats in the process, pressure was at its highest.\n\nShe faced backlash from her own supporters, questions over her position at the club, and anything other than victory at Tottenham would have been a disaster.\n\nThe club rallied around the Frenchwoman, who led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble in her debut season, by announcing she had signed a four-year contract extension 48 hours before their crucial game at Spurs.\n\nThat was the backing she needed and Bompastor could breathe a sigh of relief - and even celebrate animatedly - as her side got over the line with a 2-0 win.\n\n\"Even if we all know we can't control anything of that, we probably felt it was unfair to receive that amount of criticism,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"I know who I am, I don't need people outside my environment to tell me who I am. I will always make sure I give my best. I know I have the competence, I know I have the knowledge, I know the women's game and I do my best for Chelsea.\n\n\"I'm not saying I'm the best one, I'm not saying I'm arrogant, but I know who I am. I always make sure I support my players in the best way possible.\n\n\"My job is to make sure they go on the pitch with clarity on what they need to achieve. No-one is going to disturb me on my confidence.\"\n\nWith the WSL title seemingly out of their grasp, Chelsea's priority is to ensure they clinch a top-three spot and qualification for next season's Champions League.\n\nRivals Arsenal and Manchester United did their part earlier in the weekend - so Chelsea had to respond.\n\nTottenham, who started the game a point behind Chelsea, came out of the blocks firing and could have taken the lead when Olivia Holdt hit the crossbar.\n\nNervy Chelsea were in a battle until Keira Walsh's goal just before half-time rocked Spurs and put the Blues in the driving seat. It was the \"game-changer\" they needed.\n\n\"When you want to perform at your best, you need to have the four elements of the performance align at the highest level - the tactical, mental, physical and technical aspects,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"If one of them, or some of them, are not as high as possible, it affects the performance. We were a different team in the second half. That's who we want to be.\"\n\nBompastor's actions were deliberate on Sunday. After the warm-up, she walked out on to the pitch and high-fived every member of her squad.\n\nShe celebrated with assistant coach Meline Gerard, who lifted her up and spun her around in the dugout, when Walsh's goal put Chelsea 1-0 up - something she rarely does, but said afterwards she should do more.\n\nIn normal circumstances, a victory at Tottenham would be seen as par for the course. But this was three points which gave Chelsea a significant boost.\n\n\"I will enjoy it. I'm not going to lie, it's been a difficult time. It's been tough so we need to celebrate with players and staff,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"We know when we are at Chelsea we need to win every game and we want, as much as possible, to be in control. To do that, we need to get points to win.\n\n\"We still have a lot to play for. We know what we can improve.\"\n\nChelsea's performance still left much to be desired but Bompastor said she was \"really proud\" of how her players dealt with the unfamiliar criticism.\n\nThe Blues have won six successive domestic titles so most in the squad have never experienced a season without silverware.\n\nThey have already booked their place in the Women's League Cup final, have a fifth-round FA Cup tie to play and are in the Champions League quarter-finals.\n\nIf they win a European crown - the one trophy that has eluded them - their WSL blip will be quickly forgotten.\n\nBut experienced midfielder Erin Cuthbert said the overall feeling was \"relief\" after the Spurs victory - and this was unknown territory for the serial winners.\n\n\"It's been a tough couple of weeks, an experience that some of us haven't been used to. Over the 10 years I've been here, we've had moments like this,\" Cuthbert told BBC Two.\n\n\"The league's getting better and we've played against two top teams who probably beat us quite convincingly. It was back to the drawing board this week.\n\n\"We didn't want to be a Chelsea team who bow down game after game. That's not what we're about, that's not what we're built upon.\n\n\"It was a difficult first 20 minutes. We got quite lucky to be honest. But you're going to need a bit of luck to get out of a hole.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "\"You don't have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.\"",
    "fullText": "The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.\n\nAccording to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.\n\n“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”\n\nFive hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.\n\n“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.\n\nThe subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.\n\n“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.\n\nAs DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.\n\n“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”\n\nWhen uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.\n\nWhen Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.\n\n“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”\n\n“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”\n\nMore on DHS: There’s Something So Embarrassing About Homeland Security’s New Drone Video That We’re Gonna Have to Sit Down for a Minute",

    "fullText": "Travel content creator Murphy Ng saw something distressing while hiking near the Maliau Basin Studies Centre in Sabah, Malaysia, The New Straits Times reported.\n\nNg was walking along the Avian Trail with a ranger last December. At first, he didn't know what he was looking at.\n\n\"We spotted several piles of elephant dung along the trail, and I noticed something metallic and shiny,\" Ng said. \"At first, I thought it was just a small candy wrapper, but when I pulled it out, it turned out to be an entire plastic bag, completely intact.\"\n\nThe Times said that Ng shared the incident on Facebook. He encouraged people to be mindful of how they dispose of plastic as well.\n\nThis wasn't the first time an animal has had plastic in its digestive system, and it likely won't be the last. Even if the elephant did swallow a candy wrapper, plastic of all sizes can be harmful.\n\nEnvironment America reported that microplastics can make fish swim more slowly and damage their genes, which they can pass down to their offspring. A pregnant sperm whale was also found with almost 50 pounds of plastic in her stomach. All kinds of plastic waste kill over 1 million marine animals every year.\n\nThe effects of plastic pollution on marine life ripple out into how people live, too.\n\nAs microplastics disrupt how oceans absorb carbon, air pollution persists and warms the planet. Rising temperatures are contributing to extreme weather events, which can cause people to lose their jobs, homes, and ways of life.\n\nReducing plastic pollution helps people and wildlife live fuller lives in healthier and safer environments.\n\nPer the Times, elephant expert Dr. Cheryl Cheah said there are no known elephant deaths in Malaysia linked to plastic consumption.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSupporting brands that use less plastic or make plastic obsolete, such as Stasher bags, is crucial to reducing overall plastic use. But those options can be more expensive upfront and aren't accessible to everyone.\n\nEncouraging and advocating for brands to use less plastic, especially if it's a coordinated effort, can help. Even making sure your plastic makes its way into the trash instead of the grass can reduce pollution in ecosystems.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Manchester City's win at Liverpool ended in complete chaos - but did the referee and the VAR get Dominik Szoboszlai's red card right?",
    "fullText": "Sometimes the video assistant referee (VAR) just cannot win, stuck in a hole between what feels right in the spirit of the game and what is correct in law.\n\nManchester City thought they had scored a third goal at Liverpool which would have capped off one of the most dramatic ends to a Premier League game this season.\n\nBut it was stripped away by a VAR review for a foul committed just before the ball rolled over the line.\n\nFans will hate it, pundits won't like it, and football will turn its nose up too. Yet there really was no way the VAR, John Brooks, could not intervene.\n\nA foul was committed that facilitated a goal being scored which might have otherwise been prevented. It is really as simple as that.\n\nIt was a unique set of circumstances right at the end of a dramatic game which gave City a 2-1 win at Anfield.\n\nHere's what happened and why...\n\nMan City fight back for dramatic late win at Liverpool\n\nWith Alisson marooned upfield for a set-piece as Liverpool searched for a late equaliser, Rayan Cherki kicked the ball towards an empty net from just inside his own half.\n\nHaaland gave chase and was clearly going to outpace Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nThe City striker had overtaken Szoboszlai 25 yards from goal and looked certain to win the race - but he was pulled back.\n\nIt was a clear foul which referee Craig Pawson identified, but he played an advantage.\n\nAs the ball rolled towards the goal with the same two players still jostling to reach it, Liverpool's Hungary international was about to slide in and clear it off the line.\n\nBefore Szoboszlai could do so, however, Haaland pulled him back, and that stopped the home player from keeping the ball out of the net.\n\nThe first pull on the Norway striker muddies the waters. After all, it seemed Haaland was definitely going to score.\n\nBut they are two distinct situations. You have to separate the first foul by Szoboszlai and the subsequent offence from Haaland.\n\nWould Szoboszlai have prevented the goal had he not been fouled? There is a high chance.\n\nOn that basis it is impossible for the goal to stand.\n\nRemember that Pawson played advantage. Had Szoboszlai been allowed to successfully keep the ball out, the play would have been brought back and he would have been sent off.\n\nThe end result would be the same as the outcome of the VAR intervention: no goal and Szoboszlai sent off for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\n\nIf you take out the first pull on Haaland, it is hard to see how anyone could have a problem with the goal being disallowed.\n\nThis is not the first time, or the last, that the VAR has correctly disallowed a goal and people really struggle to stomach it.\n\nYes, the goal could be important for Manchester City at the end of the season. But the goal conceded could also turn out to be vital for Liverpool.\n\nWhile the video assistant referee's intervention was ultimately correct, leading to Pawson to announce the decision to both teams and the fans, it certainly split the crowd.\n\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville, who was covering the game for Sky Sports, said it \"feels so unjust\".\n\nHe added: \"I know there's rules but there is the smell of the game. Talk about killjoy. Just let the goal be.\n\n\"You have just killed one of the great moments of the season.\n\n\"You live to watch games like this. I am a fan of VAR, but it has just killed the joy.\n\n\"The reason fans watch football matches is for entertainment and for moments like that.\"\n\nBut ex-Manchester United captain Roy Keane said, if anything, the moment \"just added to the drama\" and described it as \"great\".\n\nManchester City forward Haaland said he actually felt sorry for his ex-RB Salzburg team-mate Szoboszlai.\n\n\"The referee has to follow the rules,\" Haaland told Sky Sports. \"I feel bad for him. Just give the goal and not the red card, simple as that.\n\n\"But that's the rules and that's how it is.\"\n\nCity boss Pep Guardiola simply told BBC Match of the Day: \"Come on referee, give the goal and go home.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): Huge save at 2-1 to keep Manchester City ahead in their win at Liverpool. This is why they bought him in - he's the guy to make big saves. He commanded his area really, really well. He wasn't able to keep a clean sheet but that was because arguably the goal of the season got put past him. He was fantastic.\n\nJayden Bogle (Leeds): Excellent going forward, he has played a number of positions this season for the team but I thought he was excellent in the 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest. He was a real outlet down that right side which is obviously huge for them and a massive three points for being safe and staying up.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City) and Axel Disasi (West Ham): Both of them have had an instant impact when they've come into the team. Disasi has to defend a bit deeper at West Ham - big, organised, putting his body on the line. He gives them a physical presence they've missed.\n\nMarc was a little lucky with the Mohamed Salah pullback - to still be on the pitch. But his leadership experience for Abdukodir Khusanov was exceptional. The level of confidence he gives this Manchester City backline is huge. Him hitting the ground running was exceptional for them.\n\nEl Hadji Malick Diouf (West Ham): Wonderful cross for the goal in the win at Burnley. He's been sensational since he came back from the Africa Cup of Nations. He's really added pace, power and a little bit of bite they have been missing down that side. He didn't have a great start to the season but we're starting to see the full potential of him now.\n\nVitaly Janelt (Brentford): He obviously gets a goal - wonderful header - but I actually thought he was just the best player on the pitch in the 3-2 win at Newcastle. I agree with Jordan Henderson in the sense he should have had the man of the match but he played well, kept it simple, broke up the game, broke forward when he needed to. A real solid midfielder's performance.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): What a difference a manager makes - being able to be free, get on the ball, go wherever he wants and be creative. I think Michael Carrick takes a lot of credit for that but again, another goal for him against Spurs, another win for United - he has to go in.\n\nRayan (Bournemouth): He was fantastic in the draw with Aston Villa. We have to look at Lucas Digne defensively but everything he did, running forward with pace, power, direct. He caused problems throughout the day. He's a big strong boy that gets his team up the pitch and he gets at the opposition - and Digne had no answers for him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): We're going to put him in the 10 even though he played right-back, but when you score a goal like that you're in. Unbelievable free-kick against Manchester City with pure technique to slice across the ball to make it swing from left to right and leave Donnarumma stranded.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): His first start back under Liam Rosenior, talking about getting his fitness back up. He loses a few points because he was against a very bad Wolves team. However fantastic, a hat-trick, goals, penalties, confidence. The most important thing is he's smiling again - that's great for Chelsea and great for England so he deserves that, as does Rosenior for giving him that.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): I don't normally give subs the opportunity to start but Gyokeres to be fair came on at 60 minutes against Sunderland and scored two goals to get Arsenal over the line. Strong from him. Maybe having Jesus and Havertz around is going to bring out the best from him from a competitive point of view. But it's a fantastic day for him and a fantastic day for Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): Huge, huge result for him at Anfield. His changes influence the game, and I think with Arsenal winning it's do or die and City put in a solid performance. Still wobbly, still a few question marks but they got the result which is all that matters.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "description": "A generation of Manchester City supporters has not experienced a winning feeling at Anfield, but all that changed on a highly dramatic Sunday evening as they fought back for a thrilling 2-1 Premier League victory.",
    "fullText": "A generation of Manchester City supporters had not experienced a winning feeling at Anfield - but all that changed on a highly dramatic Sunday evening.\n\nTrailing 1-0 to Liverpool in the 84th minute, it was turning into a theme familiar for the Citizens faithful until captain Bernardo Silva and the ice-cool Erling Haaland both netted in the dying stages to hand Pep Guardiola's side a memorable victory.\n\nCity supporters were riotous when Rayan Cherki rolled in a third into an empty net from just inside his own half, but the goal was eventually ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR).\n\nIt mattered little as they stayed well after the final whistle to celebrate their side's triumph - only a third in the league since 1981.\n\nIt was also result that keeps City in the title race. Just.\n\nBoss Pep Guardiola joked afterwards about their last victory at Anfield five years ago, which came behind closed doors during Covid restrictions, saying: \"That doesn't count, right?\"\n\nBut this brilliant turnaround meant City are only six points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 13 games left to play - including a Gunners visit to Etihad Stadium in April - having been staring at a nine-point deficit in the closing stages.\n\n\"It is so difficult, Anfield is Anfield - the tradition, the history and the crowd,\" added Guardiola. \"It always looks smaller, tighter here and the pitch doesn't look like Etihad Stadium - and the players that they have, and everything.\n\n\"Of course we would be disappointed and all the questions would be over and over [about the title race] but six points is better than nine. It is still a lot considering how strong Arsenal are in all departments.\n\n\"The last 10 games, from my experience, it is so difficult. The important thing is to try to be there and improve because the second half was not good enough again.\n\n\"All we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal and being there, try if they go slip [up] and use it.\"\n\n'Killjoy' - did VAR get late drama in Liverpool v Man City right?\n\nPremier League: Man City fight back to beat Liverpool as Szoboszlai sent off in dramatic finish\n\nThe City substitutes piling over to their fans after Cherki's goal showed how much the victory meant to them - one supporter even got carried away and jumped on to the pitch before being led away by stewards.\n\nIt was an incredible conclusion to an engrossing encounter, one that has repeatedly delivered drama in Guardiola's past tussles with Jurgen Klopp and now Arne Slot.\n\nThese two sides have been the only teams to lift the Premier League trophy over the past eight years and, while reigning champions Liverpool have fallen away this term and sit in sixth place, City are clinging on.\n\n\"What can this do to Manchester City confidence-wise, going forward?\" said former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's all about putting runs together at this stage and that is a massive result that can give them a huge confidence boost.\n\n\"They might well just - and I mean just - be in this.\"\n\nAfter their 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium earlier in the season, City achieved a league double over Liverpool for the first time since the 1936-37 campaign.\n\n\"It's an important one for City today,\" former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport. \"It's a tough place to go, Anfield.\n\n\"I thought Liverpool were really good in the second half, City were really good first half - then City have gone a goal down and dug in to get the three points.\"\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville added: \"Will this give them the bit between the teeth? Will this give them the confidence to go and chase down Arsenal?\n\nCity captain Silva started the game after recovering from a recent hamstring issue and was the catalyst for his side's comeback by prodding in the equaliser from a Haaland knockdown.\n\nThe Portuguese has now played more game against Liverpool (16) than any other City player, while his three goals at Anfield makes him City's joint-top scorer at the stadium alongside Nicolas Anelka and Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nHaaland, by contrast, scored a first goal at Anfield with his winning penalty in the third minute of added time.\n\n\"I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over,\" said Silva. \"We felt like we needed to win.\n\n\"The hope is there and we are going to fight until the end. We need to keep doing our job that we haven't lately.\"\n\nOn Sunday, no player ran more than Silva's 12.84km, while no City player made more passes in the final third than his 24, nor did they attempt more dribbles than his four.\n\nEarlier this season, Guardiola said he has a \"weakness\" for the 31-year-old and a player he \"loves\" very much.\n\nSilva is out of contract in the summer and the City boss added: \"He is one of the best players I have every trained with.\n\n\"He is the perfect captain. It is a joy for me as a manager to have him. The team comes first.\n\n\"His contribution is massive and he is one of the legends of this club.\"",

    "fullText": "A Caldwell company agreed to change its advertising after Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s office accused the business of misleading customers.\n\nLabrador’s office sued Right Now Heating, Cooling & Plumbing, alleging it was running deceptive direct-mail advertisements that claimed customers could obtain a furnace or air conditioning unit for a discounted price. Right Now denied the allegations.\n\n“You can get rid of your old furnace and replace with a brand new, top of the line furnace for $1,200,” one of the advertisements said.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office alleges that the claim and others made by the company were not true.\n\nThe lawsuit said that to get a new furnace, the customer would have to pay the installation cost for the furnace and a new air conditioning unit, and Right Now’s ad “does not disclose clearly and conspicuously the cost of the furnace or provide the complete cost to purchase and install both units.”\n\nLabrador’s office said customers have complained that the company failed to provide them with an itemized contract identifying the equipment and services they agreed to buy, and that they were provided a document titled “estimate” that the company contended was a sales contract.\n\nLabrador’s office said the company’s “estimate” had a tendency to mislead or confuse reasonable customers. It accused Right Now of a pattern of unfair competition and deceptive acts that violate the Idaho Consumer Protection Act and the Idaho Rules of Consumer Protection.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office and Right Now agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in which the company agreed to change its advertising to clearly disclose the total cost it charges customers to purchase and install its HVAC products. For instance, if the company advertises that a customer can purchase an air conditioner for $1,475 installed, it must sell the air conditioner for that price.\n\nThe agreement, in which Right Now does not admit liability, requires the company to keep all records related to customer complaints it receives for two years after the date it takes effect.\n\n“Right Now’s stipulations to the terms of this assurance do not constitute admissions by it to any facts or violations of any state or federal law, rule or regulation,” the agreement says. “Right Now enters into this assurance for the purpose of resolving the Attorney General’s concerns ... “\n\nThe company agreed to pay the Attorney General’s office $6,500 for fees and costs it incurred in pursing the lawsuit.\n\nCanyon County District Judge Randall Grove approved the agreement on Dec. 22.\n\nIdaho’s ban on buying candy or soda with food stamps is imminent.

    "description": "Likely thing for them to do!",
    "fullText": "Green Day has never been part of the MAGA agenda. The California rock band has called out Donald Trump and his administration in many of their music performances, and it doesn’t look like they’re stopping any time soon.\n\nIn recent years, the band—consisting of members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tré Cool—has replaced the lyrics of their iconic hit “American Idiot.” The song, written in 2004, initially included the lyrics “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda.” Now, when performing the song live, Armstrong sings, “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” The song itself, and the titular album it was written for, was a direct criticism of George W. Bush’s administration and the Iraq war.\n\nTrump Finally Addresses Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Abduction Years After She Called His Behavior 'Crazy' at Town Hall\n\nWhite House Officially Addresses Trump & Vance Feud Rumors After Reports the President Is Prepared to 'Strike' Against the VP's 'Betrayal'\n\nArmstrong also takes a jab at Vice President JD Vance through revised lyrics of “Jesus of Suburbia.” So what’s the beef between the president and the band?\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected into office in November 2016, the band led a chant  “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” during an appearance at the American Music Awards.\n\nDuring the first days of the first Trump administration, Billie Joe Armstrong wrote on Instagram about his immigration executive orders that targeted countries with large Muslim populations: “I feel like I’m in a state of shock. The executive orders Trump is signing feels like a vendetta.. Trump is not only taking out his revenge on the people who protested him, but also the average American that just didn’t vote for him.”\n\nHe continued, “These reckless decisions on healthcare, muslim-americans, immigration, environmental protection, freedom of speech, freedom of press, women’s right to choose what to do with their bodies, suggesting sending in the feds to Chicago .. are signs of a man that is trying to redefine what it is that keeps our common union as Americans. This is not just his ‘conservative agenda.’ It’s an all out assault on our civil liberties. His intention is to divide us as Americans. Maybe we don’t agree on all of these issues.. But can’t we see eye to eye on some?”\n\nIn an interview with NME, Armstrong said that Trump supporters were mostly “uneducated white working-class people.” Armstrong added: “That’s the problem right there. There’s this white nationalism that’s been brewing under the radar for a long time. But now [Trump’s] been able to cause people to lash out and blame minorities and it’s really confusing. I mean, blatant misogyny going on at the same time.”\n\n“I’ve got family members from Oklahoma that are big Trump supporters. And there’s no clear answer on why they’re supporting him because he doesn’t even have any policies,” he continued. “How can you have an opinion about who you want for the Leader of the Free World when the guy running doesn’t have answers to any questions?”\n\nWhen the band performed in Washington D.C., Armstrong emphasized that the sentiments didn’t feel as intense or different as other concerts. “Outside of “f—k you,” not a real lot, honestly,” the lead singer told Rolling Stone. “People know how I feel. I feel like going negative is just throwing fuel on the fire. I feel like the government is trying to create a culture war between us in a lot of ways. They’re trying to get between your average citizens based on red and blue. I think we’re in a crisis mode right now. For me, it’s important to get back to fundamentally what it feels like to be an American. We all come from different backgrounds, but we come together and create this world. It’s like a microcosm for the rest of the world. I want people to feel unity when they come to a show. At the same time, I’m not going to puss out on saying what I feel about him and his administration.”\n\nWhen asked about their obligations in the Trump administration, Cool said, “I think we have an obligation to put on a fun show and put on a concert that’s memorable, that’s energetic and that spreads joy and open-mindedness. If being open-minded and joyful is against your political beliefs, then you know, fuck you.”\n\nIn June 2025, Armstrong shared his feelings about the president. “Donald Trump in his administration is a fascist government,” Armstrong told the crowd at Download Festival in Donington Park in the U.K. . “And it’s up to us to fight back.”\n\nGreen Day was announced as a performer in the opening ceremonies for Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif., a couple of miles away from the band’s roots. When asked about whether he’ll attend the football game, Trump told reporters that he would not and then criticized the performers, which also included halftime performer Bad Bunny. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nIn their first performance of 2026, the band made their stance loud and clear with the iconic “American Idiot” line. During the performance of “Holiday” and “Know Your Enemy,” Armstrong said, “This song is anti-fascism. This song is anti-war. We stand up for our brothers and sisters in Minnesota. … Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Miller now has the floor,” referring to the ICE raids in Minneapolis that resulted in the deaths of Alex Pretto and Renee Good, while the latter line is a direct reference to homeland security advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nArmstrong also added the same sentiments when the band performed at a Super Bowl pre-show hosted by Spotify and Fanduel on Friday, Feb. 6. “This goes out to all the ICE agents out there. Wherever you are: quit your shitty-ass job. Quit that shitty job you have.” He added, “come on this side of the line.”\n\n“Because when this is over — and it will be over at some point in time — Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, J.D. Vance, Donald Trump, they’re going to drop you like a bad f—king habit.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",
