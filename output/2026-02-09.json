    "fullText": "Former Tottenham Hotspur and West Ham United manager Harry Redknapp has called for Michael Carrick to be given the Manchester United head coach position on a permanent basis.\n\nCarrick is enjoying a fairytale start to life as caretaker boss. United brought him in during December as a temporary replacement for Ruben Amorim, who was dismissed after 14 months in charge.\n\nCarrick beat Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to the role and so far, he is proving to be a shrewd acquisition. He has taken charge of four Premier League games, winning all of them.\n\nUnited have beaten Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and most recently Tottenham in that superb run. But Carrick’s impact extends well beyond the results, which currently have the Red Devils firmly within the frame to finish within the guaranteed Champions League places.\n\nAlmost overnight, he has brought in a front-foot, positive style of football that has the fans believing once more.\n\nWhile opposition defences have struggled to contain United’s aggressive approach, debate persists over whether Carrick is the right long-term choice for the club.\n\nThe likes of Roy Keane and Gary Neville have argued that United should not go for Carrick – a claim that was rubbished by Michael Owen.\n\nSpeaking after the 3-2 win over Tottenham, Rio Ferdinand explained that it is getting increasingly difficult to ignore Carrick for the role permanently.\n\nRedknapp has now weighed in, urging United to give him the job.\n\nRedknapp, who gace Carrick is senior debut at West Ham in 1999, said [as quoted by The National], “I saw him when he was a 12-year-old at West Ham.”\n\n“He used to come down from Newcastle during the school holidays. He’s just the nicest guy, fantastic footballer, class player, passed the ball, read the game, and I’m just so happy that he’s got a chance.”\n\n“We don’t have to keep bringing in second-rate foreign managers to England. There’s enough lads there. Give them the opportunity to do the job.”\n\n“There’s lads in the lower divisions. Give them an opportunity.”\n\nRedknapp added, “Michael’s got a chance now, so I’m pulling every week for him to keep getting results and get that job on a full-time basis.”\n\nUnited are next in action on Tuesday when they go away to West Ham.\n\nFeatured image Carl Recine via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Throughout NBA history, the Los Angeles Lakers have been home to some of the most dominant scorers the game has ever seen. From the league’s earliest days to the modern era, Lakers stars have not only carried their team offensively but also set the scoring standard for the entire NBA. Leading the league in scoring while wearing purple and gold has always signaled a season of individual brilliance and historical significance.\n\n2025–26: 33.5 PPG (current pace)\n\nIn his first season wearing a Lakers uniform, Doncic immediately established himself as the league’s most dominant offensive force. His scoring lead reflects a rare blend of volume, efficiency, and creativity, as he punishes defenses at all three levels. Luka’s ability to control tempo while still producing elite numbers makes this season feel both historic and sustainable. If the pace holds, it would be one of the most impressive scoring campaigns in franchise history.\n\nKobe’s back-to-back scoring titles represent the apex of his individual offensive dominance. The 2004–05 season showcased his unmatched shot-making and willingness to shoulder the entire offensive burden. In 2005–06, he followed it up with another scoring crown, highlighted by legendary performances and relentless competitiveness. These seasons cemented Bryant as the most feared scorer of his era.\n\nShaq’s scoring title came during the lockout-shortened season, where his physical dominance was simply overwhelming. Defenses had no answer for his combination of size, power, and touch around the rim. Night after night, opponents were forced to foul or concede easy points. This season set the stage for the Lakers’ upcoming dynasty.\n\nJerry West led the league in scoring during a period defined by tough defense and limited spacing, making his numbers even more remarkable. His offensive game was built on precision, footwork, and an unshakable confidence in big moments. West carried the Lakers with consistency and poise, embodying the prototype of a complete guard. This season further solidified his legacy as one of the greatest scorers of his generation.\n\nGeorge Mikan was the NBA’s first true dominant scorer and the foundation of the Lakers’ early success. His three consecutive scoring titles came at a time when the league was still defining itself, and Mikan was clearly ahead of his peers. He forced rule changes, reshaped defensive strategies, and established the center position as the game’s focal point. These seasons made him the original face of Lakers greatness.\n\nEach Lakers player who led the NBA in scoring reflects a different era, style, and evolution of the game, yet all share the same impact: offensive supremacy. Whether through finesse, power, or relentless shot-making, these seasons stand as benchmarks of greatness within the franchise’s storied legacy. Together, they reinforce why the Lakers remain synonymous with elite scorers and unforgettable individual performances.\n\nThe post Los Angeles Lakers players who led NBA in scoring appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Alexandra Eala is in line for another boost after her performance at the Abu Dhabi Open.\n\nHer popularity was clear in Abu Dhabi, where plenty of supporters turned up just to watch her play.\n\nEala’s tennis seems to be benefiting from this, with her enjoying a breakthrough season in 2025.\n\nShe hit a ranking milestone after the Australian Open and has now improved on that again by making it to the quarterfinals in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAlthough she achieved a career-best ranking after the Australian Open, it is worth noting that Eala exited in the first round of the tournament.\n\nShe has since made back-to-back quarterfinal appearances, first at her home WTA 125 event in Manila and then at the WTA 500 tournament in Abu Dhabi.\n\nThat run in Abu Dhabi almost did not happen. Eala was down 4-0 and facing match point in the final set against Aliaksandra Sasnovich before pulling off a remarkable comeback.\n\nFollowing that win, she moved up five spots in the rankings to reach world number 40, marking another milestone.\n\nAiming to continue her progress towards that goal, Eala is set to debut at the Qatar Open. Her first-round match will be against the promising Czech teenager, Tereza Valentova.\n\nThe 20-year-old star is now just eight places shy of being seeded at Grand Slams and some of the larger WTA 1000 events.\n\nShe is not the only player making moves this week. The biggest jump belongs to Sara Bejlek, who claimed her first WTA title by defeating Ekaterina Alexandrova and has soared 63 places to world number 38.\n\nWhile she has not set a new career-best ranking, it has still been an encouraging week for Emma Raducanu.\n\nThe Briton reached her first final since winning the US Open, making it through to the title match at the WTA 250 event in Cluj-Napoca.\n\nThis time though, she fell short of the trophy, losing out to Sorana Cirstea in straight sets.\n\nEven without the title, Raducanu’s run has seen her climb five spots in the rankings. She now sits at world number 24, her highest position since August 2022.\n\nNext up for Raducanu is a first-round match against Camila Osorio at the Qatar Open, where she will look to continue her strong form.\n\nSimilar to Eala, the 23-year-old Briton will need to reduce the pressure of defending a large number of ranking points at the upcoming Miami Open before the tournament takes place next month.\n\nRoger Federer shares his all-time favorite Super Bowl memory at Seahawks vs Patriots\n\nLearner Tien’s humorous response when asked for his ‘biggest fear’",

    "description": "After watching the early running at Barcelona, McLaren CEO Zak Brown believes the same four teams will stay ahead of the pack under F1’s 2026 regulations. Formula 1 has entered a new era in 2026 with the introduction of new engine, aero, chassis and tyre rules.",
    "fullText": "After watching the early running at Barcelona, McLaren CEO Zak Brown believes the same four teams will stay ahead of the pack under F1’s 2026 regulations.\n\nFormula 1 has entered a new era in 2026 with the introduction of new engine, aero, chassis and tyre rules. The 2026 F1 regulations mark the biggest regulatory overhaul in history, due largely to the new engines with a near 50/50 split between electric and combustion power.\n\nThe sweeping changes led some to wonder if they might shake up the competitive order, but after early testing in Barcelona, it seems little has changed at the front. McLaren still look like Mercedes’ main challenger for now.\n\nMercedes were already expected by many to lead under these regulations, especially with their history of excelling during rule changes. There are even suggestions they may have exploited a grey area within F1’s new power unit guidelines.\n\nThere were questions around Red Bull heading into the 2026 season, with the team taking on engine manufacturing for the first time. It was Christian Horner who set up Red Bull Powertrains when Honda signalled their exit from Formula 1.\n\nDespite early doubts about how reliable that first RBPT DM01 unit would be, built in collaboration with Ford, McLaren CEO Zak Brown came away from Barcelona “impressed” by how solid it looked right out of the box. Brown even admitted he’d prefer if it wasn’t as competitive as it appeared.\n\n“It kind of looks like the usual suspects, but it is hard to tell in what order,” said Brown, speaking via RacingNews365. “The Red Bull engine was very strong.\n\n“I think everyone was pleasantly surprised. I’d rather them not be as competitive, but I’m impressed with what they’ve done because they came out, they did a lot of miles and they seem to be very competitive.”\n\nRed Bull are still working on the drivability of their 2026 F1 rules engine following the test in Barcelona, where reliability was the top concern for every team. But the early signs suggest Red Bull will be among the front-running teams with McLaren, Mercedes and Ferrari again.\n\nThe quartet were the class of the field during the 2025 F1 season, with McLaren securing 34 podiums, Red Bull taking 15, Mercedes reaching 12 and Ferrari getting seven from a possible 72. The remaining four rostrums went the way of Williams (2), Sauber and Racing Bulls (1).\n\nMcLaren (14), Red Bull (8) and Mercedes (2) even accounted for all 24 Grand Prix wins in the final year of F1’s latest ground-effect era. Also, McLaren won the 2025 F1 constructors’ title at the Singapore Grand Prix with six rounds to spare, to match Red Bull’s record set in 2023.\n\nThe Woking natives ultimately finished last year with a 364-point lead over Mercedes in the constructors’ standings, as Lando Norris also won the F1 drivers’ championship for the first time. Red Bull and Ferrari were third and fourth with 382 and 435-point deficits to McLaren.\n\nFerrari hope to catch F1 rivals off guard with surprise upgrade on Lewis Hamilton’s 2026 car\n\nOscar Piastri tipped as the ideal replacement for one driver if he leaves McLaren in 2027\n\nKim Kardashian and Lewis Hamilton seemingly go public as a couple at Super Bowl LX",

She was born in the United States. It draws extra attention to her moves on the slopes, including during Monday's slopestyle competition.\n\nHer worldwide popularity due to her early fame and social media stardom only shines an additional light on her every move.\n\nGu got her Olympics competition underway Saturday in Italy when she finished second in the qualifying round of the women's slopestyle competition.\n\nShe'll have plenty more time in the spotlight before these Olympics are through.\n\nMORE: Amber Glenn has the most surprising interest at the Olympics\n\nGu made her decision to compete for China when she was 15 years old in 2022, and she did it for representation reasons.\n\n“The U.S. already has the representation,” Gu has said in the past about popularity of women's skiiers in the United States. “I like building my own pond.”\n\nAdding a bit to the controversy was that Gu had already competed for Team USA during three slopestyle World Cup events before she made the switch.\n\nShe wrote at the time that it was a \"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to help to promote the sport I love.\"\n\nMORE: Breezy Johnson won a gold medal for the U.S., and then she broke it\n\nGu then captured all the headlines while landing a double cork 1620 in the big air competition to claim the gold medal.\n\n“My whole thing was, it’s all upside,” recalls Gu. “Because if I land, I will win the Olympics.

    "fullText": "The 2026 NBA Three-Point Contest brings together a compelling mix of proven champions, first-time participants, and rising shooters who reflect how central the long ball has become in today’s game. From seasoned All-Stars with past hardware to young players eager to announce themselves on a national stage, this field is stacked with both credibility and intrigue. Each competitor enters with a distinct shooting profile, ensuring a contest defined by contrasting styles, streaks, and momentum swings.\n\nDevin Booker returns to the Three-Point Contest as one of the more experienced shooters in the field, bringing back memorable performances from past All-Star Weekends. Although his current 3-point percentage this season is a career low, his pedigree and confidence with the deep ball keep him a threat on the racks. Booker won this event in 2018 and has made multiple appearances, which gives him both historical relevance and fan appeal. Expect him to lean on his rhythm and composure when the clock starts.\n\nRookie Kon Knueppel has quickly established himself as one of the league’s rising long-range threats with an excellent percentage this season. His inclusion in the contest marks a rare opportunity for a first-year player to compete for the title, and he’ll aim to become the first rookie ever to win. Knueppel’s high volume and efficient shooting make him a serious contender right out of the gate. His youth and fearless shooting style will be fun to watch as he battles veterans.\n\nDespite missing the entire NBA season with a torn Achilles, Damian Lillard will still suit up for the 3-Point Contest, a testament to his elite reputation as a marksman. Lillard is a two-time winner of this event and can tie the all-time record with his third title. His career 3-point scoring and clutch gene make him a perennial fan favorite, regardless of in-season play. Lillard’s participation adds a compelling storyline of resilience and competitive pride.\n\nTyrese Maxey enters the contest riding a breakout season as one of the NBA’s most dynamic scorers, combining pace with deep shooting prowess. This will be his first appearance in the Three-Point Contest, aligning with his first All-Star starter nod. Maxey’s ability to make tough catch-and-shoot attempts under pressure gives him a versatile edge on the racks. His confidence from downtown blends well with his overall offensive game, making him a dark-horse candidate.\n\nDonovan Mitchell is another All-Star entering the contest with a reputation for confident and flashy deep shooting. As the Cavaliers’ lead scorer, Mitchell blends volume with creativity, often pulling up from range in rhythm. His presence adds star power and competitive intensity to the field, especially when the spotlight gets bright. Expect Mitchell to attack the money balls with the same aggression he brings in late-game situations.\n\nJamal Murray brings his sharpshooting pedigree from both the regular season and playoff stages to the Three-Point Contest. Known for his calm demeanor and clutch threes, Murray complements Stephen Curry’s shooting leadership in Denver’s offense. This appearance aligns with his first All-Star selection, showcasing his ascent among the league’s premier perimeter scorers. Given his range and confidence, he can heat up quickly when the rack lights turn on.\n\nVeteran forward Bobby Portis Jr. earned his first 3-Point Contest nod thanks to a breakout shooting season, boasting one of the highest percentages among contestants. His stride into elite floor spacing has helped Milwaukee’s offense evolve, making him more than a traditional big man. Portis’ smooth release and catch-and-shoot rhythm make him a legitimate threat in this format. His inclusion underscores how modern bigs can impact spacing and contest formats alike.\n\nNorman Powell enters the event as an All-Star and one of Miami’s most reliable 3-point shooters this season. His shooting profile blends athleticism with catch-and-shoot efficiency, and he has experience from prior contests as well. Powell’s ability to get hot in spurts could make him dangerous in the rapid-fire rhythm of the 3-Point Contest. As a player who thrives in momentum, he’ll look to heat up early and carry it through the rounds.\n\nWhen the final rack is emptied on Saturday, February 14 at 5:00 p.m. ET, the 2026 Three‑Point Contest is sure to hinge on rhythm, confidence, and a competitor’s ability to perform under the clock. With this blend of elite scorers, specialists, and fearless newcomers all taking aim at the same moment, the difference between victory and elimination could be a single swish or miss. No matter who hoists the title at the State Farm 3‑Point Contest, this field underscores how deep shooting continues to define the modern NBA and why this event remains one of All‑Star Weekend’s most anticipated traditions.\n\nThe post NBA 2026 Three-point contest participants appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "The 2025 NFL season has concluded with Super Bowl LX, and now the focus shifts to the 2026 offseason. For the Chicago Bears, they'll be looking to shore up the roster for head coach Ben Johnson in free agency and the 2026 NFL Draft.\n\nThe Bears have some important roster moves to make this offseason, including with some in-house free agents -- whether that's re-signing some or filling holes left by departing players. Chicago has 27 players scheduled to become free agents in 2026 according to Over The Cap, including some key starters and contributors.\n\nThere are some players who could very well sign a contract extension, including safeties Kevin Byard and Jaquan Brisker, as well as cornerback Nahshon Wright and linebacker D'Marco Jackson, who all had big seasons with the Bears. But there are some big decisions to be made by general manager Ryan Poles about those players and the rest of the group of pending free agents.\n\nHere's a look at the Bears players set to hit the open market in free agency:\n\nThe 2026 free agency negotiation window begins March 9, where teams can negotiate with available players. The free agency period officially opens two days later on March 11.\n\nThe Bears are projected to be $5.3 million over the salary cap for the 2026 season, which is the 12th worst in the league. But Chicago will make some moves in regards to contract restructures and perhaps parting ways with some expensive veterans to free up cap space to make some moves this offseason.\n\nFollow Bears Wire on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on Bears Wire: Bears pending free agents: Who's slated to hit the market in 2026",

LSU is 22-3 on the year and 4-3 in games vs. quad one opponents, meaning all of their losses have been to Q1 teams. LSU is 3-0 vs. quad two opponents and 3-0 vs. quad three opponents.\n\nLSU beat Auburn 77-44 on Sunday, bouncing back after the Tigers fell at Texas last week. Freshman ZaKiyah Johnson led the way for LSU with 16 points. MiKaylah Williams also scored in double-digits.\n\nLSU's net ranking indicates the Tigers are still in play for a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament. March is approaching, but the Tigers still have several chances to build their resume while already having a few signature wins under their belt.\n\nLSU's next game is a big one as the Tigers will host South Carolina in Baton Rouge on Saturday. LSU has all week to prepare as they search for an elusive victory over Dawn Staley's Gamecocks.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LSU Wire: Where LSU women's basketball stands in updated NET rankings",

    "fullText": "The Sporting News national high school girls basketball top 25 rankings (Feb. 9) originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's finally high school basketball postseason time in a small but hardy handful of high-powered states and federations. And despite Bullis' ESPN-televised upset of Long Island Lutheran, the rankings have more or less stabilized – for now.\n\nHere are The Sporting News national high school girls basketball rankings for the week of Feb. 9.\n\nPREVIOUS RANKINGS: Preseason | Dec. 1 | Dec. 8 | Dec. 15 | Dec. 22 | Dec. 29 | Jan. 5 | Jan. 12 | Jan. 19 | Jan. 26 | Feb. 2\n\nAfter winning a disputed national title last season, Bishop McNamara is drawing nearer to a second consecutive national title – perhaps an undisputed one – with every week in which it wins out. Last week, the Mustangs pulled through in overtime against Elizabeth Seton for the second time this season and then beat St. John's by a 14-point margin. Only TAHC, St. Mary's Ryken, and Bishop Ireton remain on their regular season schedule, and Bishop Ireton also took the Mustangs to overtime earlier this season.\n\nThe Knights beat Rancho Christian 85-65 in a tuneup game to end the regular season. Ontario Christian is the No. 1 seed in the CIF-Southern Section Open Division playoffs as expected and shares a pool with Rancho Christian and JSerra – two teams it's already beaten by 20 points this season.\n\nMercifully, the Cavaliers' regular season is down to its last week after a 70-37 rout of Green Run and 88-13 demolition of Ocean Lakes. Princess Anne's 70-57 win over Bullis looks even better now after Bullis upset Long Island Lutheran.\n\nThe Monarchs cruised past St. Ignatius 66-22 in their only game of the week.\n\nLong Island Lutheran's upset loss to Bullis doesn't help the Trailblazers' stock in a vacuum due to their loss against Long Island Lutheran, but the Trailblazers actually move up a spot without any teams having a strong argument to leap them. Like Ontario Christian, Sierra Canyon enters CIF-SS Open Division pool play tasked with beating two teams it's already beaten – Oak Park and Corona Centennial, the latter of which played the Trailblazers to a 62-55 finish.\n\nThe winning streak is up to 11 games, and all except for the win over Long Island Lutheran have been blowouts.\n\nIt's no surprise to see Bullis breaking through for a high-ranking victory, and the blow is cushioned by the fact that LuHi is still 1-1 this season against Bullis. But it's definitely concerning to see the Crusaders fall 75-72 to a team they previously beat 70-49.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Etiwanda didn't lose another game for the rest of the regular season after frontcourt stars Jaylee Moore and Tess Oldenburg became eligible on Dec. 26 following the CIF's transfer sit-out period. The two-time reigning national champions and three-time reigning Open Division state champions crack the top eight for the first time this season and have a serious shot to continue to their dynastic postseason success across the Southern Section and/or state playoffs. Etiwanda will face Fairmont Prep and Saint Joseph (Lakewood) in CIF-SS pool play after beating Saint Joseph 72-44 in January.\n\nThe Dragons made a statement with a 65-38 rout of West Des Moines Valley to nearly clinch a third consecutive undefeated regular season.\n\nThe Moose' regular season is complete and they will play for an FSL title this week.\n\nIt's unclear what the rest of SPIRE's season looks like, but we can probably all agree that it would be fun to see them in a national postseason setting.\n\nSt. James stayed sharp with a 77-52 rout of St. Frances Academy.\n\nA bye week came immediately after DME Academy's only week of the season. DME has the resume to bounce back up in the rankings if the opportunities arise with its only loss coming to The St. James Performance Academy.\n\nThe Lancers blew out St. Rose, Red Bank Regional, and Thrive Carter to keep the winning streak going.\n\nRed Bank Catholic's defense was stifling as the Caseys pulled out a win in their lowest-scoring game of the season, a 41-33 victory over formidable Cardinal O'Hara.\n\nDespite a 14-point loss to top-ranked Bishop McNamara, St. John's moved up four spots thanks to its prior win over Bullis, which just beat Long Island Lutheran. The Cadets also won by 20 points last week against an Elizabeth Seton team that pushed them to overtime earlier this season and has now done so twice against Bishop McNamara too.\n\nIvanna Wilson-Manyacka went off for 26 points and 15 rebounds as Bullis toppled Long Island Lutheran on ESPN. For now, the Bulldogs rise four spots for the win over Long Island Lutheran, which dropped three. If that win didn't \"only\" move them to 1-1 on the season against LuHi, it might've vaulted them a bit higher despite their loss to St. John's. But Bullis' current winning streak could definitely continue to move the needle in the rankings as Bullis' season winds on. And avenging a 21-point loss to an elite team is an excellent sign and accomplishment.\n\nLPA only scored half as many points against Kingdom Collegiate Academy as it did when it beat KCA 88-72 in January, losing 53-44 in its only game of the week.\n\nThe Timberwolves passed a key test on Tuesday by beating West Linn 61-52.\n\nOne more game and the undefeated regular season is official. Will anybody beat Westlake at all this season?\n\nThe blurb for Westlake can be copy/pasted for Texas' other undefeated large school powerhouse. With Westlake in UIL Division 6A and Wagner in 5A, both could go undefeated through state titles – although both will have to outlast deep playoff fields of serious unranked competition to do so.\n\nThe Tigers look to beat Wayne Memorial, which is otherwise unbeaten, for the second time this season on Tuesday. Belleville won 77-49 when they played on Jan. 16.\n\nHoover finished the regular season in strong fashion, putting on for Alabama as usual in a 75-51 win over perennial Georgia stalwart Holy Innocents' Episcopal. At this point, the Buccaneers are a heavy favorite to otherwise win out after getting upset in their season debut.\n\nIt's a juicy CIF-SS Open Division pool play pairing for Sage Hill, which got placed in a bracket with Redondo Union and Mater Dei. Sage Hill has given Mater Dei a run for its money a handful of times in recent memory but hasn't broken through, and this will be its best chance yet.\n\nWith four games left in the regular season, Wauwatosa East is in the clear having previously blown out every team remaining on its schedule. The Red Raiders and Arrowhead are both in WIAA Division 1, so a playoff rematch is incoming if both teams remain unbeaten against all other challengers.\n\nDemocracy Prep Agassi Campus (NV)\n\nSN's national high school girls basketball top 25 rankings (Feb. 2)\n\nComplete guide to boys and girls basketball playoffs, state championship start dates\n\nMcDonald's All-American Game 2026: Complete rosters, college recruitments, commitments\n\nTexas signee, former Mamba Academy star drops 64 points on senior night\n\nBoys basketball: No. 1 SPIRE Academy loses 66-52 to No. 14 Montverde Academy",

    "fullText": "The 2025 season is complete after a thrilling Super Bowl. Now the work begins for all 32 teams to retool their roster and prepare for a potential playoff appearance next season. After an offensive coordinator and passing game coordinator change, the Eagles' roster will likely undergo further changes. The Birds have 21 players who'll test the restricted or unrestricted free-agent market during the 2026 NFL offseason. Several key factors include a pending contract extension for Jalen Carter and the contract status for star tight end Dallas Goedert.\n\nReed Blankenship is one of the biggest names on the list, and the defense could look drastically different with Nakobe Dean entering the final year of his rookie deal.\n\nWith the off-season officially underway in Philadelphia, we're looking at nine players who seem likely to depart.\n\nThe 27-year-old Uche played in 12 games and recorded 1 sack.\n\nOjulari saw action in three games before spending the bulk of the season on IR.\n\nThe 2022 sixth-round pick just finished his fourth season in the NFL, and likely played his last game in Philadelphia. A Former college teammate of Jalen Hurts at Oklahoma, eaching the end of his rookie contract. Calcaterra played in 62 games with 22 starts.\n\nA former Commanders first-round pick, Dotson spent two unproductive seasons with the Eagles, playing in 34 games and recording 37 catches on 69 targets for 478 yards and one regular-season touchdown.\n\nA versatile and solid lineman, the 29-year-old played 363 snaps at center and guard, allowing two sacks.\n\nThe Eagles acquired Howell via trade in August, making him the third-string quarterback. He didn't play a single game with the Eagles this season, but could certainly return.\n\nOkoronkwo played in just one game this season and landed on IR.\n\nDillon signed a one-year deal with Philadelphia after missing last season with a neck injury, but things didn't work out. The veteran running back lost his role when the Eagles brought in Tank Bigsby via trade. Dillon, 27, ended up with just 12 rushing attempts for 60 yards this season.\n\nThe Eagles signed Epps to their practice squad at the start of the season and eventually promoted him to the active roster. When rookie Drew Mukuba fractured his ankle, Epps regained his starting role at safety next to Blankenship.\n\nThe 30-year-old veteran signed a one-year deal with the Eagles in the offseason and improved for Vic Fangio as the season went on, outplaying Kelee Ringo and Jakorian Bennett.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Eagles Wire: NFL Free Agency: 9 Eagles players who seem likely to depart",

    "fullText": "As Bayern Munich prepares to face RB Leipzig in the DFB-Pokal quarterfinals on Wednesday, there is uncertainty about just how fans will be able to get to the Allianz Arena.\n\nThe Munich Transport Company (MVG) is in the midst of labor strife and might not support the normal runs to the stadium on game day:\n\nThe Munich Transport Company (MVG) issued a statement today: “The MVG will be on strike again on Wednesday, February 11 (..) How the Allianz Arena can be reached by public transport for the cup match on Wednesday evening is currently being intensively examined. MVG is in close contact with the Allianz Arena, FC Bayern, the authorities and other partners regarding this matter. Under the aforementioned circumstances, it does not appear possible to connect the stadium to a limited extent by bus. Whether and which specific options will be available on Wednesday evening is part of the ongoing review. As soon as reliable results are available, they will be communicated.”\n\nThis certainly complicates matters for fans who are attending the match. We will follow the situation and provide updates as things develop.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "With the summer window approaching, Chelsea are expected to be active again under Todd Boehly and Clearlake, who spent nearly £300m last summer.\n\nDespite the heavy spending, they balanced it with significant sales. Noni Madueke went to Arsenal for over £50m and Christopher Nkunku made the move to Milan.\n\nThere are clear areas where Chelsea are looking to strengthen this time around. They need a new goalkeeper, have shown interest in defensive reinforcements, and cover in midfield is also on the list. Emmanuel Emegha has been brought in to add depth up front.\n\nJamie Gittens and Alejandro Garnacho have not found their feet at Stamford Bridge yet. If Geovany Quenda is not considered ready, the club may look for another winger. All signs point towards more changes ahead.\n\nAmong Chelsea’s current choices, Benoit Badiashile has slipped down the order, even before Levi Colwill returns to full fitness or Mamadou Sarr and Aaron Anselmino get their opportunities in the starting XI.\n\nRight now, Badiashile looks to be behind Wesley Fofana, Trevoh Chalobah and Tosin Adarabioyo in Rosenior’s plans. By the time the summer arrives, there’s a good chance he’ll be looking for a new club.\n\nCaught Offside have noted that with Colwill, Sarr, Anselmino and potential new arrivals all competing for places, the £35m centre-back is likely to struggle for any meaningful game time if he stays at Stamford Bridge next season.\n\nAccording to Caught Offside, AC Milan are interested in adding another Chelsea player to a list that already includes Ruben Loftus-Cheek, Nkunku, Christian Pulisic and Fikayo Tomori. And they are not the only ones keeping an eye on him.\n\nThe report also suggests that Juventus might consider a summer move if he becomes available. Meanwhile, there is even talk of Roberto De Zerbi looking to bring the former Monaco defender back to France.\n\nIt is becoming increasingly clear that breaking into the first team will be a challenge for him. Rosenior has already shown a preference for Chalobah and Fofana as his main centre-backs, and Colwill has not even returned yet.\n\nBadiashile needs to recognise the situation he is in – there are too many players ahead of him, and staying put would likely mean limited minutes. A summer move looks like the best option if he wants regular football at this stage of his career.\n\nWhy Madonna attended Tottenham vs Chelsea in the Women’s Super League\n\nAlejandro Garnacho unhappy with £25m Chelsea teammate even as Wolves seal victory",

    "fullText": "Who: Boston College Eagles (15-9-1) vs boston university terriers (13-13-2)\n\nHow to Watch: The matchup will be live on NESN.\n\nIt hasn’t been that long since the Eagles met the terriers; the Eagles came away with the 4-1 win at Agganis a week and some ago, and Louka Cloutier & Dean Letourneau were named second and first stars of the night respectively.\n\nCole Hutson still leads the terriers with 25 points, followed by Cole Eiserman who has 17.\n\nIn net, Yegorov has a .902 save percentage.\n\nThe terriers won against Northeastern in a shootout last Monday night to punch their ticket to the championship game. They beat Maine in OT on Friday in their in-between game.\n\nHonestly, I don’t know. The Eagles simply laid an egg on Friday night against Vermont, getting blown out on home ice 6-1 and taking a big hit to their NPI.\n\nThe team was clearly distracted, and no one had a good game. There’s not really much to take away from it or much more I can say. It was a lackluster, uninspiring effort for a game that required them to stay focused and needed to end with them feeling confident. This is when you hope someone is able to rally the group with a short turnaround and remind them what they’re capable of – whether that’s the coaches or the captains or an unsung leader without a letter.\n\nThere’s a lot of noise surrounding the Eagles after their performance against Vermont, despite their strong showing against Harvard – they’re going to have to completely block it out and get back on track.",

    "fullText": "Klint Kubiak addressed his future within minutes of the Seattle Seahawks winning Super Bowl LX, offering clarity that quickly shifted attention away from the celebration.\n\nThe offensive coordinator spoke candidly on the field, acknowledging both the magnitude of the moment and what comes next in his coaching career.\n\nSpeaking to NFL Network moments after the final whistle, Klint Kubiak reflected on the win while hinting at an imminent transition.\n\n“Yeah! That’s up to God, and we’re just gonna we’re gonna enjoy tonight. You guys know I’m going to Las Vegas. I’m fired up about it. But tonight, for one more night,” the Seahawks OC said.\n\nThe comments immediately drew attention because they acknowledged what had already been widely expected. Kubiak is set to become the new head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, bringing his Super Bowl-winning credibility with him.\n\nRather than deflecting the question, Kubiak leaned into the reality of the situation. He made it clear that while his focus remained on celebrating with the Seahawks, his next chapter was already in motion.\n\nThe conversation turned more direct as Kubiak was pressed further on his future, with the coach offering unmistakable confirmation of his next step.\n\n“Hell yeah, I’m going, of course. I’m going. Yeah, just confirmed it right here,” Kubiak added.\n\nThe remarks removed any remaining doubt about his departure from Seattle. After helping guide the Seahawks to a Super Bowl title, Kubiak is now preparing to take over a Raiders franchise looking for stability and identity.\n\nThe Raiders are handing him the keys at a time when the team is searching for long-term direction, while Kubiak arrives with momentum built from championship success.\n\nFor Seattle, the timing is bittersweet. The Seahawks secured Super Bowl glory, but the victory also marked the end of Kubiak’s tenure with the organization.\n\nDeMarcus Lawrence’s immediate ‘not in labor’ question after winning Super Bowl LX is going viral\n\nKenneth Walker III wins Super Bowl MVP despite Jason Myers setting record\n\nDrake Curse strikes New England Patriots as rapper loses $1 million in Super Bowl bet",

Now there's, in her words, \"a high likelihood that I'm going to cross the finish line and I'll just have half an eyebrow.\"\n\nMIKAELA SHIFFRIN ⛷💨 (@mikaelashiffrin) • Instagram reel6,209 likes, 159 comments - mikaelashiffrin on February 9, 2026: \"IYKYK…and now you know🫣🤷‍♀️🤪😅OOPSIE\".\n\nShiffrin's split-second decision-making on the slopes has helped make her one of the greatest skiers in history. But her spontaneous decision to shave part of her eyebrow may not have been one of her best.\n\nDespite that little setback, Shiffrin will begin her quest for gold in three events at the Milano Cortina Games starting Tuesday in the women's team combined.\n\nHere's a look at when Shiffrin is competing at the 2026 Winter Olympics:\n\nFeb. 10: Women's team combined (slalom) | 8 a.m. ET\n\nFeb. 15: Women's giant slalom run 1 | 4 a.m. ET\n\nFeb. 15: Women's giant slalom run 2 | 7:30 a.m. ET\n\nFeb. 18: Women's slalom run 1 | 4 a.m. ET\n\nFeb. 18: Women's slalom run 2 | 7:30 a.m. ET\n\nHere's how to watch Shiffrin at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Italy:\n\nEach Olympic event can be viewed live with Peacock, NBC's exclusive streaming service, or NBCOlympics.com.

Lebron was one of 55 total players named to the preseason watch list.\n\nA returning starter, Lebron will more than likely play a crucial role in the Tide’s lineup throughout the 2026 season. The talented shortstop was nothing short of elite in 2025, as Lebron was credited with 18 home runs while batting an impressive .316 on the year. Lebron recorded 72 RBI in 2025 as well, as the star shortstop will look to pick up right where he left off.\n\nLebron started all 59 games for the Tide last season. The shortstop was named as a Golden Spikes Award semifinalist during his sophomore campaign, as Lebron was widely regarded as one of the top shortstops in all of college baseball in 2025.\n\nLebron and the Tide will begin the season on Feb. 13 against Washington State, as Alabama will look to start the 2026 campaign with a series win over the Cougars.\n\nContact/Follow us @RollTideWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Alabama news, notes and opinion.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Roll Tide Wire: Alabama's Justin Lebron named to Golden Spikes preseason watch list",

If you don’t know about Thompson, know this: he was the player Michael Jordan aspired to be.\n\nState is the more fierce of the two teams lately and that counts for a lot, but Louisville has a major size advantage.\n\nMikel Brown is back, but he hasn’t been the same since his back started giving him problems: in the four games since he got back, Brown has shot 63.3%, 7.7%, 50%, 14.3% and 20%. This from a projected lottery pick. It just sort of shows you how fine the edge is for high-level athletes. He’ll be fine eventually, but right now? He’s struggling.\n\nState is more organized right now. It’s a smallish team but athletic and mobile. A lot may ride on how well Ven-Allen Lubin does. And in his last three games, Quadir Copeland has 36 assists and 5 turnovers, which is unbelievable.\n\nThere are a lot of factors to State’s recent success, but Copeland and Lubin have been really good during that streak.\n\nThe Pack gets UNC at home next Tuesday and for the first time in forever, that’s a must-watch game.\n\nSpeaking of UNC, following Saturday’s court storming, the ACC fined Carolina $50,000 as required.

Brooklyn made some moves prior to last week's trade deadline and with the Chicago Bulls (24-29) coming to town, the Nets may get to see two of their trade acquisitions get some playing time. If you're wondering how you can watch all the action live, you've come to the right place!\n\nThe Nets come into this game following a 127-113 win over the Washington Wizards on Saturday in which Brooklyn raced out to a 26-point lead to end the first quarter and never looked back. Forward Michael Porter Jr. led the way for the Nets with his 23 points and six rebounds while center Day'Ron Sharpe had one of his best games of the season as he dropped 19 points and nine rebounds in 20 minutes off the bench.\n\nThe Bulls enter this matchup after a 136-120 loss to the Denver Nuggets on Sunday in which Chicago stayed within striking distance until the fourth quarter where Denver blew the game open by way of an 39-16 rally in the final period. Forward Matas Buzelis led the team in scoring with 21 points while also chipping in eight rebounds and guard Collin Sexton had 17 points and four assists in 29 minutes off the bench.\n\nHere is what you need to know to get ready for this matchup:\n\nLocation: Barclays Center, Brooklyn, NY\n\nNets: OUT: Egor Demin (rest), Michael Porter Jr. (knee), Tyson Etienne (G League), Chaney Johnson (G League), and EJ Liddell (G League).\n\nBulls: OUT: Zach Collins (toe), Noa Essengue (shoulder), Yuki Kawamura (G League), and Mac McClung (G League).

    "description": "The highest-leverage longevity habits (20% effort for 80% impact) — nutrition, exercise, sleep, supplements, and sauna protocols from evidence-based experts.",
    "fullText": "A guide to the highest-leverage longevity habits (20% effort for 80% impact) compiled from evidence-based clinicians and coaches. Curated from Andrew Huberman, David Sinclair, Layne Norton, Andy Galpin, Rhonda Patrick, Bryan Johnson, and others.\n\nDisclaimer: This guide is for informational purposes only and is not medical advice. Consult a qualified healthcare provider before making changes to your diet, exercise, or supplement routine — especially if you have existing health conditions or take medication.\n\nBase your diet on whole or minimally processed foods (meat/fish/eggs or plant proteins, vegetables, fruit, legumes, whole grains, nuts, olive oil) and dramatically reduce ultra-processed foods. [1] [2] [3]\n\nPrioritize protein + fiber so you stay full and support muscle: each meal should include a clear protein source and high-fiber plants (vegetables/beans/fruit/whole grains). [1] [2] [3]\n\nLimit the “big 3” that make diets go off the rails: liquid calories, added sugars, and highly processed snacks/meals, because they make overeating easy. [1] [2] [3]\n\nProtein intake supports muscle growth and maintenance, aids weight management by promoting satiety, strengthens bones and immunity, regulates hormones and blood sugar, and enhances overall recovery and metabolic health. [1] [2]\n\nAim for 1.2 to 1.6 g protein per kg bodyweight per day (Example: 70 kg -> 85 to 110 g/day). [1] [2]\n\nIf you lift weights, diet (cut), or want muscle go higher: 1.6 to 2.2 g/kg/day. [1] [2] [3]\n\nTip: Spread your protein intake across multiple meals throughout the day for better absorption.\n\nFiber intake, a non-digestible carbohydrate from plant foods available as soluble and insoluble types, promotes digestive regularity, lowers cholesterol and blood sugar levels, supports weight control through satiety, boosts gut microbiome health, strengthens heart protection, and reduces risks of diabetes, cancer, and inflammation. [1]\n\nAim for 25 to 35 g/day as a simple baseline. [1] [2] [3]\n\nIf you want a more “optimized” target, build toward 30 to 60 g/day (increase slowly). [1]\n\nThe easiest way to hit it: make 2 meals/day include a clear fiber source (vegetables + beans/lentils + fruit and/or whole grains). [1]\n\nTip: increase fiber gradually over 1 to 2 weeks to avoid bloating and drink more water.\n\nSugar intake, particularly added sugars and refined forms like fructose in processed foods and drinks, is associated with obesity, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, heart disease through inflammation and high triglycerides, fatty liver disease, cognitive decline and depression, dental decay, gout, and increased cancer risks. [1]\n\nDefault: minimize added sugar (especially sugary drinks + corn syrup); get sweetness mainly from whole fruit. [1] [2]\n\nA simple “OK” cap: keep added sugar within conservative public-health limits, e.g. ≤25 g/day (women) or ≤36 g/day (men), and ideally ≤10% of calories. [1]\n\nLongevity-leaning approach: many people in this camp try to avoid refined/added sugars most of the time. [1] [2] [3]\n\nCoffee consumption, primarily through its caffeine and antioxidant content in moderate amounts (3-4 cups daily), enhances cognitive alertness and performance, is associated with lower risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and certain cancers like liver and prostate, supports liver and kidney health, lowers all-cause mortality, and provides anti-inflammatory metabolic benefits. [1] [2]\n\nProper hydration regulates temperature, supports cognitive function and mood, aids digestion and waste removal, enhances physical performance and joint lubrication, prevents headaches and fatigue, and promotes heart health and kidney function. [1]\n\nUse a simple baseline: drink to thirst, and make urine pale yellow most of the day (not crystal clear all day, not dark). Usually it is 30 to 35 mL per kg/day. [1] [2]\n\nDistribute this throughout the day — don't chug it all at once. Stop earlier to avoid waking at night.\n\nAlcohol consumption, even in moderation but especially when excessive, damages the liver leading to cirrhosis and cancer, weakens the heart causing high blood pressure, arrhythmias, and cardiomyopathy, impairs brain function resulting in cognitive decline, memory loss, and addiction, increases risks of multiple cancers (mouth, throat, breast, liver), disrupts immunity and sleep, promotes mental health issues like depression and anxiety, and accelerates overall mortality. [1] [2]\n\nBest-for-health default: the less the better, with zero being the safest baseline for brain and long-term health. [1] [2]\n\nIf you choose to drink anyway: no more than 2 drinks per week. [1] [2]\n\nFish oil, rich in omega-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA, provides key health benefits including improved heart function, better brain and mental health, eye and skin support, and reduced joint inflammation. [1] [2]\n\nDefault: get omega-3s from fatty fish ~2x/week, or supplement if you do not eat fish. [1]\n\nIf supplementing: use a product where the label shows EPA + DHA, and aim around ~1 to 3 g/day EPA+DHA (many people land near ~2 g/day). [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nSafety note: if you have AFib history, bleeding risk, or take blood thinners, be cautious with higher doses. [1]\n\nCreatine supports rapid energy production in muscles, which can improve strength, power, high-intensity exercise performance, and muscle mass, while also enhancing brain function like memory and cognition. [1] [2]\n\nTake creatine monohydrate 5 g/day, consistently (timing is not important). [1] [2] [3]\n\nFor brain support under stress consider 10 g/day (split 5 g + 5 g) for ~6 to 8 weeks; this is often discussed for cognitive benefits, especially when sleep-deprived or “stressed brain” contexts. [1] [2]\n\nSome research discussed uses ~20 to 30 g once (for example 0.35 g/kg once) to blunt sleep-deprivation hits to cognition. [1]\n\nZone 2 cardio, a moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (roughly 60-70% of max heart rate), enhances fat burning, mitochondrial efficiency, endurance, cardiovascular health, and recovery while reducing chronic disease risk. [1] [2]\n\nUse an easy intensity check: Zone 2 should feel like you can talk in sentences but not sing (steady, sustainable). [1] [2]\n\nAim for 150 to 200 minutes/week of Zone 2 (for example 3 to 4 sessions of 45 to 60 min). [1] [2]\n\nStrength training, involving resistance exercises like weights or bodyweight movements, builds muscle strength, boosts metabolism, enhances bone density, reduces injury risk, and improves overall longevity and mental well-being. [1]\n\nDo strength training 2 to 3 days/week as a strong baseline for healthspan (and to maintain/build muscle as you age). [1] [2]\n\nProgression rule of thumb (Galpin): increase gradually, roughly ~3%/week intensity and ~5%/week volume (do not crank volume up endlessly; keep weekly jumps modest). [1]\n\nDeload cadence: build for about ~6 weeks, then take a deload week before building again (50% fewer sets and/or using 10% to 20% lighter weights). [1] [2]\n\nSleep is a vital restorative process that enhances cognitive function, boosts immune defenses, supports heart health and metabolism, aids muscle recovery, and improves mood and emotional regulation. [1] [2]\n\nKeep a consistent sleep and wake time (within ~30 to 60 minutes every day) and aim for ~7 to 9 hours (Sinclair often mentions 7 to 8). [1] [2] [3] [4]\n\nGet morning outdoor light during first hour after waking (roughly 10 to 30 minutes, more if cloudy) to anchor your body clock and improve nighttime sleep. [1] [2]\n\nCut caffeine at least 8 to 10 hours before bed. [1]\n\nMake the bedroom cool and dark (cool room helps deeper sleep). [1] [2]\n\nReduce bright light/screens in the last 1 to 2 hours before bed (dim lights, warm lighting). [1] [2]\n\nOptional supplements (only if needed): low-dose melatonin and/or magnesium, glycine, L-theanine are commonly discussed as “try if you struggle” tools. [1] [2]\n\nSauna bathing, involving exposure to dry heat, mimics moderate exercise through heat stress, is associated with cardiovascular improvements, reduced inflammation, enhanced recovery, better mental health, and longevity benefits. [1] [2]\n\nSimple “works for most” protocol: 80 to 100°C (176 to 212°F) for 5 to 20 min, 2 to 3x/week (more frequent can be better if you tolerate it). [1]\n\nIf you want the “max benefit” version many people reference: 4 to 7x/week is the high-frequency range most associated with big health correlations in Finnish sauna studies (observational). [1] [2]\n\nTraining/recovery timing note: heat after training can be used for recovery, but it’s not magic; apply it as a tool, not a replacement for sleep/nutrition (and be mindful of dehydration).

    "description": "Andrew Athias said his job at the halftime show was really easy: \"Don't move. Stand here and be one with the grass.\"",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Andrew Athias, 33, a Philadelphia-based digital marketer and content creator. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI was one of the 500 bunches of dancing grass at Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show. I got paid $18.70 per hour for the gig, but I would've done it for free.\n\nI'm a big Bad Bunny fan. I've been to three of his concerts since my girlfriend introduced me to him in 2021.\n\nI found the grass gig through a company called Backlit, which handles finding extras for the halftime show. I found it last year when I saw Kendrick Lamar at the Super Bowl halftime show, but I forgot about it until Bad Bunny was announced as Super Bowl's headliner in October, and I decided to apply.\n\nI was one of the few crazy people to fly over from the East Coast to be part of the field cast. I flew out to San Francisco from Philadelphia in the middle of a snowstorm and have been out here for two weeks, rehearsing for the big day, and it has been worth it.\n\nThe requirements for the role were pretty basic. You had to be no taller than six feet, no shorter than five feet seven inches, and of an athletic build.\n\nThe listing said we had to be able to wear a 40-plus-pound costume and to be comfortable dancing in proximity with other performers for long periods. Other than that, we had to measure every part of our body from head to toe, elbow to floor, shoulder to clavicle, etc. Those were the only requirements.\n\nThey didn't tell us we'd be wearing a grass costume and kept it super vague.\n\nMy part was actually really easy. They just told me where to stand, and they said, \"Don't move. Stand here and be one with the grass.\"\n\nThe suits were heavy and uncomfortable. Every now and again, you'll have a blade of plastic grass going places where grass should not go. Fortunately, we were given some protective goggles.\n\nThere were definitely times when we were wearing the suits for about six or seven hours because they had to make alterations. There were about eight practices in total, with the last three lasting 12 hours each.\n\nBut the production crew did their best to make this suit as wearable as possible; they listened to every complaint and tried to fix it.\n\nAnd getting to see behind the scenes of the production was a treat.\n\nIt was really cool to see Bad Bunny perform just a foot away. But because he was in LA for the Grammys during some of our rehearsals, the crew had a Bad Bunny stand-in they called \"Good Rabbit.\"\n\nOne of the other things they asked for in the application was whether you had marching band experience or experience in the entertainment industry. I was in a collegiate a capella group, so I'm not scared of performing in front of big crowds.\n\nBut it's definitely different when you have a stadium full of people vibing, moving, grooving to Bad Buddy's music.\n\nI spent about $2,600 on flights, hotels, and a rental car for the two weeks. I'm a content creator without a full time job now, so I didn't have to take any paid time off for this.\n\nThe hardest part of the whole thing wasn't the long hours or the heavy costume, but rather keeping quiet about it. They made us sign an NDA to not talk about it or post anything on social media for two weeks.\n\nSo when I saw people posting about what his setlist was going to be, it was so hard to have so much knowledge and power and not be able to do anything with it.\n\nI told only a very small handful of people that I was going to San Francisco and would be involved in the half-time show.\n\nI didn't tell them what I was dressed as. I didn't tell them where to look for me on the field. All I said was, \"You're going to see me. You just didn't know that you saw me.\"",

    "description": "Bad Bunny celebrated Puerto Rico at the 2026 Super Bowl, where he became the first Spanish-speaking solo artist to headline the halftime show. Trump hated it.",
    "fullText": "When Bad Bunny took the field at the 2026 Super Bowl for a historic, joyful halftime show, he wore a jersey with his Latino heritage stitched into its very fabric.\n\nIt's an apt metaphor for his performance, which eschewed explicit anti-ICE statements (he covered that at the Grammys, anyway) in favor of celebration with a side of symbolism.\n\nNods to the Puerto Rican singer's motherland were peppered throughout the set, which was designed to evoke the US territory's signature aesthetics, from sugar cane fields to a storefront labeled \"La Marqueta\" (a slang term for market) and various vendors selling tacos and piraguas (shaved ice). While performing \"El Apagón,\" a song about the frequent blackouts and infrastructure issues affecting Puerto Ricans, Bad Bunny brought this symbolism to the forefront, waving the Puerto Rican flag.\n\nHe also proclaimed in English, \"God bless America,\" and brandished a football printed with the phrase \"Together, We Are America.\" He added in Spanish, \"We're still here.\" (Puerto Rico is a US territory, and Puerto Ricans are American citizens.)\n\nIt was a stark and knowing contrast to the Latinophobia and anti-immigrant messaging hawked by the Trump administration. So much so that President Donald Trump complained online about Bad Bunny's performance and his choice to sing primarily in Spanish.\n\n\"The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER! It makes no sense,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social after Bad Bunny left the stage. \"Nobody understands a word this guy is saying.\"\n\nFor those who understand visual storytelling, however, Bad Bunny's performance made perfect sense. He didn't need to say \"ICE out\" or declare an explicit political opinion. In keeping with the recent tradition of Super Bowl halftime shows, Bad Bunny used iconography to take a stand instead.\n\nBad Bunny's performance shares DNA with Beyoncé and Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl appearances, both of which used bold imagery to make strong statements.\n\nBeyoncé's surprise appearance at Coldplay's 2016 Super Bowl halftime show became famous — and, to some, infamous — for the iconography present in her performance of her then-new single, \"Formation.\" In the midst of Trump's first presidential campaign, Beyoncé and her backup dancers wore outfits that channeled the Black Panther Party, an organization formed amid the '60s Civil Rights Movement that fought for Black liberation.\n\nThe song itself isn't explicitly political. But as a celebration of identity and legacy that features lyrics about Beyoncé's parents, her daughter, and her features (\"I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils\"), Beyoncé performing it — with visual references to the song's themes in her and her dancers' costumes, to boot — was innately political.\n\nIt's not that Beyoncé is allergic to making explicit political statements: She famously performed in front of the word \"Feminist\" at the 2014 VMAs, and sang \"Votin' out 45, don't get out of line\" on her 2022 album \"Renaissance,\" referring to Trump as the 45th president. But when the NFL hosts musicians for the night, they've lately preferred make their statements symbolic rather than overt.\n\nLast year, Kendrick Lamar followed suit during his own Super Bowl halftime show, outfitting himself and his dancers in red, white, and blue. Although Lamar kept the music focused on his own enemies and triumphs, he used audacious visual language to pose broader, poignantly relevant questions: Who's allowed to claim patriotism? What does it mean to be an American, especially in times of oppression and conflict?\n\nBad Bunny's performance raised similar questions, but offered simpler, more optimistic solutions. For the finale, he was surrounded by backup dancers, band members, and other performers holding flags from around the world; when he proclaimed \"God bless America,\" he listed out all the countries in both North and South America.\n\nBad Bunny is not a politician, nor can he single-handedly cure the world of hatred and division. Still, for a brief moment, on a small square of American turf, he chose to use the stage to show millions of people what that could look like.",

    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl LX halftime show was more than a hit-filled performance — it was a carefully staged cultural statement.\n\nBeyond the headline moments, the show was packed with intentional details, from visual symbolism to casting choices, that were easy to miss in real time.\n\nWe've rounded up the moments you might not have caught, and why they mattered.\n\nBad Bunny's halftime show featured several celebrity cameos from the likes of Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin, Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G, Jessica Alba, and Young Miko.\n\nLady Gaga appeared in a blue dress and sang a salsa rendition of her chart-topping hit \"Die With a Smile,\" while fellow Puerto Rican native Ricky Martin took to the stage to perform Bad Bunny's \"Lo Que Pasó a Hawaii.\"\n\nMaria Antonia Cay, known as Toñita, also made a cameo, briefly appearing onstage to hand Bad Bunny a drink. She runs Caribbean Social Club in Williamsburg, one of the last Puerto Rican social clubs in New York City.\n\nA couple featured in Bad Bunny's performance actually got married during the set, league sources confirmed to ESPN.\n\nThe outlet said that the couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to their wedding. Instead, the singer invited them to get married during his show.\n\nToward the end of his performance, Bad Bunny switched to English and said, \"God Bless America.\" He went on to list countries from South America up to North America as dancers walked behind him holding the respective flags — he finished with the United States and Canada.\n\nHe then closed his performance by holding up a football stamped with the words \"Together, We Are America\" and spiking it on the field.\n\nDuring his performance of \"El Apagón,\" a song whose title translates to \"the power outage,\" Bad Bunny leaned into the track's themes about the frequent blackouts in Puerto Rico.\n\nThe stage featured his dancers dressed as jíbaros, or traditional Puerto Rican farmers, who began climbing utility poles that sparked and exploded.\n\nBad Bunny brought Puerto Rico to Levi's Stadium by covering the stage in greenery inspired by Vega Baja, where he grew up.\n\nIn another stadium, that kind of lush landscape would typically be created by wheeling carts of plant props onto the field, Bruce Rodgers, whose company Tribe Inc. handled the show's production design, told Wired.\n\nBut NFL rules limited how many carts could be used to protect Levi's Stadium's natural grass, so the team dressed performers as plants to get the same effect, Rodgers said\n\nBad Bunny's halftime performance featured several cultural symbols of Puerto Rico, including sugar cane fields, a piragua stand, and a casita.\n\nAs fireworks lit up the sky to mark the end of Bad Bunny's halftime performance, a stadium screen displayed the message, \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love.\"\n\nThe quote echoed a line from the singer's Grammy acceptance speech last week.\n\nWhile accepting the award for best música urbana album, Bad Bunny called out ICE.\n\n\"We're not savage,\" he said. \"We're not animals. We're not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans.\"\n\nLater that night, Bad Bunny also made history as the first artist to win Album of the Year with an all-Spanish record.",

    "description": "Driving is too scary, expensive, and exhausting for Gen Z. So they're waiting to get a license and making their parents ferry them around.",
    "fullText": "As a mom of three kids, Christina Mott had been counting the days until her oldest son, Colton, got his driver's license.\n\nIt falls on her to drive each of them — age 10, 12, and 16 — to three different charter schools every day, and then to extracurriculars and social outings. \"Having him able to drive himself would free up a lot of time,\" she says. If only.\n\nWhile out one day on his learner's permit, Colton rolled through a red light and a stop sign. He panicked and decided to put his license on hold indefinitely. \"Getting in crashes, that's something that scares me a lot,\" Colton explains.\n\nThat means his mom is still chauffeuring three kids around their Northern California suburb. Christina, who's 46, says a lot of her fellow parents are going through the same thing: Teenagers are slamming the brakes on the time-honored rite of passage of getting a license at 16, either out of fear or because they're put off by the process or the costs. And that means a lot of Gen X parents are stuck behind the wheel longer than they bargained for.\n\n\"When I was 16, we didn't think this way about driving at all. Driving meant freedom!\" Christina says.\n\nEven so, she admits Colton doesn't feel quite as ready for a license as she was at 16. \"He's not very observant and tends to live in his own world,\" she says. \"I don't think, without GPS, that he would even know how to get to the grocery store from our house that we've lived in for eight years. So, the idea of him dealing with traffic lights and other drivers makes me nervous, too.\"\n\nIn 1983, roughly half of US 16-year-olds had a driver's license. That number fell to 25% in 2022, according to data from the Federal Highway Administration. Most teens will eventually get their licenses, the data shows — they're just waiting a lot longer.\n\nEven Dara Khosrowshahi, the CEO of Uber — a beneficiary of the Delayed Driver trend — says it's caught him off guard. In an interview on the Verge's \"Decoder\" podcast last May, Khosrowshahi revealed he'd been struggling to convince his 18-year-old son to get a license.\n\n\"It drives me crazy,\" Khosrowshahi said. \"I don't know about you, but did you get a license the minute you could drive? It was just such a thing. It was a goal in life. It represented freedom.\"\n\nDelayed Driving goes hand in hand with a broader trend: Gen Z is falling behind older generations across a range of social markers. They're having less sex and waiting longer to couple off and start families. They don't go out as much and drink less alcohol, in part because it's so easy to socialize, shop, and order meals online.\n\n\"If you think of why those 16-year-olds — 30 or 50 years ago — were so eager to get their license, a lot of it had to do with wanting to drink and have sex,\" says Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, a professor of psychology at Clark University in Massachusetts and author of \"Emerging Adulthood: The Winding Road from the Late Teens Through the Twenties.\"\n\nThat's still the case — Gen Z is just slowing down the march into adulthood.\n\nAdd to that the convenience of rideshare apps like Uber and the promise of self-driving cars, and the urgency of getting a license has diminished. \"They don't see their future as necessarily involving a car,\" Arnett said. He believes the trend will be a boon for autonomous vehicles.\n\nThe situation has sent a lot of Gen X parents to online forums like Reddit to complain that they're \"chauffeuring kids old enough to drive themselves.\" One described her kid as a \"21-year-old passenger prince.\"\n\nRather than teenagers begging their parents to let them drive, more parents are the ones doing the begging.\n\n\"It's almost like pushing him off the cliff,\" Giselle Rodriguez Greenwood, who lives in the suburbs of Houston, says of her 17-year-old son's resistance to getting a license.\n\nIt's the same for his classmates, nearly all of whom still depend on their parents or their friends' parents to get them around. \"It becomes 'rock, paper, scissors' as far as who's going to take who to whose house,\" Greenwood says. \"We have a text thread of lacrosse parents, and that's where we make the plea for help.\"\n\nLike Mott, Greenwood is not unsympathetic to her teen's reluctance. Houston is consistently ranked among the most unsafe cities for driving. She wonders if she's more of a helicopter parent than she realizes. \"Sometimes, I fear I may have imparted my fears on him,\" she says.\n\nIndeed, a lot of parents worry about pushing their teens to drive before they're ready — or have a handle on their screen use. A 2025 study by Mass General Brigham found that teenage drivers spent about 21% of car rides glancing at their phones, and about 26% of those glances lasted 2 seconds or longer. Even if they put their phones away, growing up with screens can change how Gen Zers navigate the road.\n\nStill, driving is an essential skill, and Greenwood plans to take a harder line with her younger son, who's 14. \"I'm just throwing him behind the wheel as soon as he can,\" she says. \"I'm not doing this again.\"\n\nEven a strong parental nudge isn't always enough to get a kid to the DMV. When Sarah Wilson, a mother of three in Nashville, stopped offering to ferry her 16-year-old around town, her daughter didn't She's now in college, and still doesn't know how to drive. She gets around mostly on her bike or by catching a ride with friends.\n\n\"It becomes frustrating when she can't help with long drives or simple errands,\" says Wilson, who's 50. \"It's a form of independence I want her to have, even if she's been slow to claim it.\"\n\nRobert Roble, a Lyft driver in Auburn, Georgia, a small city 42 miles from Atlanta, has noticed an uptick in the number of driving-age teens requesting rides to afterschool jobs, sports practice, or the mall. \"I had a 22-year-old this week that hadn't gotten his driver's license yet,\" says Roble, who's 59.\n\nBoth Lyft and Uber have reported that fewer Gen Z drivers have translated to more business for rideshare companies. \"The data shows that most 16-year-olds, at this point, are not that interested in a driver's license,\" Uber president Andrew Macdonald said in a recent interview.\n\nFor some families, even the occasional rideshare surge pricing makes more financial sense when you account for the combined costs of driving school, an extra car, and the price of gas.\n\nThe cost of a used car has soared in recent years, thanks in part to tariffs and supply chain slowdowns, as have monthly auto insurance premiums. Meanwhile, fewer public schools offer free driver's ed programs, the global research firm IBISWorld reported last year, adding to the logistical and financial hurdles of getting a driver's license.\n\nIn a few states, including New Jersey, Illinois, Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, licensed teenagers are limited to how many friends they can pick up in their cars. In California, for example, a teenager under 18 has to wait a year before they can carpool with all their friends. The law prohibits having anyone under 20 in their car without an adult over 25 present. \"With that restriction, it takes a lot of the fun out of it,\" says Colton, the Northern California teen.\n\nNina McCollum, who lives in Ohio, says cost was a factor in her 16-year-old son not immediately getting his license. The state requires formal driver's education to apply for a license, and McCollum was hit with sticker shock when she looked into it. \"The cheapest I've found from a reputable provider is like $700,\" says McCollum, who's 57.\n\nThe family decided to delay the classes for a few months, and McCollum has been giving her son informal lessons in the meantime.\n\nWhat has surprised her is that it often feels like it's her — rather than her teenager — who's antsy for him to drive. None of her son's close friends have licenses, even though they're old enough; they're all dependent on their parents to drive them to band practice and basketball games.\n\n\"It's really hard to force a 16-year-old to do things,\" she says. \"It's not like he's going out all the time, and I can ground him.\"\n\nThe lack of enthusiasm to drive doesn't change the fact that most of America is heavily car-dependent. More than 9 in 10 households have at least one car, and 87% of people drive every day.\n\nUnless you live in a few walkable US cities with solid mass transit, not driving means relying on other people for carpools, timing your outings to bus schedules, spending a lot on Taxis and rideshares, or walking in areas simply not built for it.\n\nFor years, that's how Alma Benitez got by. \"Since I come from a first-gen household, the mentality is that the man is a provider and is always able to drive you around,\" says Benitez, who's now 24. As a license-less teen, she relied on her dad and brother for rides; otherwise, she walked or took public transportation in White Plains, New York.\n\nUltimately, it held her back. \"Because I didn't drive, most of my jobs and school locations would have to be a commutable walk or bus transportation ride,\" she said. \"So it kind of limited me.\"\n\nShe finally got her license three years ago, when she was 21. Benitez now makes TikToks for new drivers, offering instructions for how to pump gas or make smooth turns. Most of the comments under her videos are from people in their late 20s. \"A lot of people are really scared to get on the road,\" she says.\n\nBack in California, Colton Mott is trying to win back his confidence about driving. He's again taking driving lessons and has an appointment for his test at his local DMV. His mom signed him up for both.\n\n\"I feel really good about him driving again,\" she says. \"He's been asking to drive every day.\"\n\nJulia Pugachevsky is a senior health reporter on Business Insider's health team.",

    "description": "Private equity assets under management swelled to an estimated $6.7 trillion in 2025, up 72% over the last five years.",
    "fullText": "A lot of people are about to get rich from OpenAI's expected IPO. You probably won't be one of them.\n\nRetail investors will eventually get their shot. They'll be able to buy the stock, maybe even turn a tidy profit, once the company goes public. But they'll be showing up late to the party. As usual the real money, the kind that changes lives, will have already been made.\n\nThis isn't a one-off. It's a pattern that's becoming more common as companies stay private longer. Last year's post-IPO pops from names like CoreWeave and Figma showered early backers with riches. For everyday investors, it was a familiar gut punch. Both stocks now trade significantly below last year's highs.\n\nReddit and other online forums are littered with retailer investors complaining about being \"exit liquidity\" for venture capitalists and executives who cashed out early positions for huge gains. Individual investors who bought near the top are now left holding the bag.\n\nThe retail crowd knows they're missing out. That fuels resentment. Locked out of private markets, everyday investors often watch the biggest wealth-creation moments happen without them. If broad participation is supposed to be a pillar of capitalism, why has so much of the action moved behind a velvet rope?\n\nFor better or worse, many of those barriers to entry are coming down. Financial institutions are rolling out new products in private equity and credit markets aimed at everyday investors.\n\n\"The train has indeed left the station,\" said Stanford finance professor Amit Seru. \"The industry sees a once-in-a-generation chance to tap a vast pool of new capital.\"\n\nIn the latest installment of Business Insider's \"Future of Capitalism\" series, we explore the push to \"democratize\" private markets and what it means for retail investors. Retail access is expanding to investments that would've been unheard of years ago. They're finally getting a seat at the private-markets table.\n\nThe question now is whether that seat will ultimately be worth the risk.\n\nFor years, private markets swelled in size without much fanfare. That's changing.\n\n\"What we're finding is a lot of people are more curious about what they don't know about private markets,\" said Monish Verma, the CEO of Vardhan Wealth Management. \"They've been hearing more about it. They understand it's more than just equities and bonds.\"\n\nInvestment managers are looking to meet the moment.\n\nPrivate equity assets under management swelled to an estimated $6.7 trillion in 2025, up 72% over the last five years, according to data from the analytics firm Preqin. The firm predicts this number will swell to nearly $12 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nAssets under management in private credit investments rose to $2.2 trillion last year, an 86% increase over the same time frame. Preqin predicts this will surge to $4.5 trillion by decade's end.\n\nUS policymakers have been warming to the idea that private markets should be opened up to more investors. In August, the SEC reversed a rule that had previously limited access to certain closed-end funds. That nudged the door to private markets a little wider for investors who are \"non-accredited,\" or those with a lower net worth than the markets are typically opened to.\n\n\"Financial innovation sometimes means getting out of the way of capital formation and allowing all investors to gain the benefits of our robust markets,\" Paul Atkins, the chair of the regulatory agency, said in prepared remarks last May.\n\nPrivate-market funds have been rolling out investment vehicles that aren't just for the ultra-rich. In the last year or so, the likes of KKR, State Street, and Apollo have launched a series of new funds and ETF products that offer the public access to public and private credit. SoFi, meanwhile, has debuted a handful of private markets funds specifically aimed at retail investors, with minimum investment requirements as low as $500.\n\n\"I certainly think it's not a fad,\" Robert Callagy, associate managing director at Moody's Investors Service, told Business Insider about the slowly expanding access to private investments.\n\nInvesting in public assets is inherently risky. In the event a company goes under, stock investors get paid last, if at all, with whatever is left over after a company reimburses its creditors.\n\nBut private markets are a different animal entirely, and come with their own unique set of risks. Some key differences might catch investors off guard, Callagy and Seru said.\n\nFor one, retail investors are used to being able to access their money easily. Private assets are less liquid and can be tougher to sell if you want to offload. SoFi's Cashmere Fund, which offers access to growth-stage companies backed by VCs, explicitly notes that it's aimed at long-term investors who don't need quick access to cash.\n\nRetail traders usually expect their money to be put to work right away, in vehicles like ETFs and mutual funds, Callagy said. This is often not the case for private-market funds, which tend to hold significant cash positions as managers scan the market for opportunities. The amount of private-equity money on the sidelines has been near record levels in recent quarters.\n\nThere also tends to be an information gap. Private companies aren't required to publicly disclose their earnings, debt, or other financial information. It's more difficult for an investor to know exactly what they're buying.\n\nCallagy says that the pressure to put cash to work could lead to more lax underwriting standards by money managers dealing with limited information.\n\nWhile access to private markets has expanded, retail investors, some of the supposed beneficiaries who spoke with Business Insider, don't seem convinced. The prevailing mood is distrust. Many see a version of capitalism where institutions still win, even as markets are branded more \"democratic.\"\n\nBilaal Dhalech, a 29-year-old day trader and an electrical engineer based in Toronto, is interested in accessing private companies because he feels like institutions currently have a leg up on him.\n\n\"They're getting in early, riding the value creation, and then exiting after the IPO,\" he told Business Insider, noting the post-offering stock skids that have befallen many recent market debutants.\n\n\"Having access earlier would level the playing field and absolutely change outcomes,\" Dhalech added.\n\nMinwoo Lim, a full-time trader who lives in Dubai, is more outright skeptical. In an interview, he said he believes institutional investors will continue to have an edge over the retail crowd, no matter how accessible private markets become. In his view, alternative asset managers will simply create a new structure that once again limits the most enticing private opportunities to institutions.\n\n\"If a private deal is available to retail, it's usually because the good part is already gone,\" Lim said. \"Institutions already took the real upside.\"\n\nDavid Villalobos, a trader based in Colorado, is more ambivalent. He said he's not interested in branching out into private markets, and that most retail traders have a tough time navigating public markets as they are.\n\n\"From my perspective, this push resembles prior bubbles we've seen in financial history,\" he said. \"Retail participants are likely to be attracted more by the narrative than the substance.\"\n\nIf Wall Street feels that skepticism, it isn't showing in its pursuit of expanding the reach of private markets.\n\nThe private equity industry has already successfully lobbied to allow private credit instruments into retirement funds, and big asset managers tout the benefits of diversification.\n\n\"You really need to be adding that private market exposure as a source of income, as well as a source of lower volatility,\" said Gargi Pal Chaudhuri, BlackRock's chief investment and portfolio strategist for its Americas division.\n\nShe conceded that it's not for everyone, though.\n\n\"There's a liquidity premium that you will pay for that, but you're supposed to make that decision based on the portfolio that you have and the liquidity biases that you have.\"\n\nGoverning bodies have been clear that guardrails are needed. In a report from last fall, the SEC suggested a series of checks and balances designed to protect retail investors, ranging from investment limits to more robust disclosure requirements.\n\nSeru said he also believes in safeguards, like limits on the amount of illiquid private market assets allowed in ETFs. He also thinks there needs to be more transparency about who will provide liquidity in the market if there's a stress event.\n\nEventually, Seru says, the line between private and public markets will start to blur, to the point where the historical advantages of private markets are eroded.\n\n\"At some point, the quest for scale becomes self-defeating,\" he said.\n\nEven with rules in place, Seru only recommends private market funds to investors who can handle putting money into relatively illiquid funds for a long period of time.\n\n\"Done poorly, democratization simply transforms a high-performing asset class into a systemic risk machine,\" he added.",

    "description": "OpenClaw creator Peter Steinberger said specialized AI, not AGI or LLMs, is a better future for the technology.",
    "fullText": "In Silicon Valley, many investors, founders, and tech giants often frame AI as an all-powerful force — something approaching omniscience.\n\nThey call it artificial general intelligence, or AGI, a hypothetical system capable of matching or exceeding human reasoning across virtually all tasks and, beyond that, superintelligence, which would surpass human cognition altogether.\n\nAGI is the thing OpenAI and its competitors are racing to be the first to bring to life.\n\nThe industry isn't a monolith, however, nor are its builders.\n\nPeter Steinberger, the creator of OpenClaw, the now-viral personal AI assistant powering the agent-only social network, Moltbook, told the Y Combinator podcast on Saturday that he thinks the best AI is specialized, not generalized.\n\n\"What can one human being actually achieve? Do you think one human being could make an iPhone or one human being could go to space?\" he said. \"As a group we specialize, as a larger society we specialize even more.\"\n\nHe said the same holds true for AI. Current AI systems are labeled as \"general.\" In practice, however, they are already specialized for particular tasks — like startups building models to solve Erdos math problems or identify gene mutations.\n\nWhile the hype around AI has largely focused on the types of models being built — from large language models to computer vision systems or even world models — some startups and tech giants are also experimenting with more focused, subject-specific forms of intelligence.\n\nAxiom, a startup founded by former Meta researcher Carina Hong and backed by $64 million in seed funding, for instance, is building specialized intelligence to tackle advanced mathematics.\n\nGoogle DeepMind has developed AlphaGenome, a system designed to predict how variants or mutations in human DNA affect a wide range of gene-regulating biological processes.\n\nCompanies are also developing smaller models, which could make it easier to build AI systems tailored to specific subjects or domains. Aidan Gomez, the CEO of Cohere, which builds AI technology for enterprises, told Business Insider in 2024 that there was increasing pressure to build \"smaller, more efficient models\" and to make them smarter with the right data and algorithms, rather than just scaling them.\n\nSteinberger is not the only one to push back against the idea of an all-powerful general intelligence.\n\nTimnit Gebru, a computer scientist who founded and leads the Distributed AI Research Institute, said AGI is a \"fictional thing\" in a November video published by Nature.\n\nShe said the backbone of engineering lies in building well-scoped, testable systems. The pursuit of a \"fictional, undefined 'machine god,'\" she said, is pushing the industry toward deeper labor exploitation and environmental damage.\n\nSteinberger, previously best known for launching the PDF processing company PSPDFKit, came out of retirement to build with AI. He said the technology has come a long way since he started, when his goal was simply to build \"something that could type stuff so my computer could do things.\"",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with 55-year-old Bethenny Frankel, former star of The Real Housewives of New York City and founder of The Core, a private dating membership community. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have a much bigger business now than when I was on The Real Housewives of New York City, was running Skinnygirl, my lifestyle brand famous for its low-calorie cocktails, and landed on the cover of Forbes.\n\nI got a big one-time check when I sold the liquor arm of Skinnygirl, but what I'm doing now, through The Core, my private dating membership community, influencing, and investing, is bigger than ever.\n\nI'm busy, but I'm not sitting at a desk every day. My brain works well, I have a phone, and that's really all I need. I wrote most of my New York Times bestselling books on a BlackBerry.\n\nHere's a typical day in my life.\n\nI wake up fairly early. I let the dogs out, then go give my daughter a hug and a kiss if she lets me in her room for a second. I really love that. I tend to troll her by sitting on her bed for a few minutes, but I've learned that teens don't like to talk in the morning.\n\nI make myself a strong iced coffee with my Cumulus coffee maker and feed the dogs. My dogs are really important to me, and I try to get as many good snuggles in with them as I can.\n\nBetween 7:30 and 8:30 a.m., I usually go for a walk on the beach. I moved from New York to South Florida in March 2025, and I love wandering around like a weirdo on the beach. I often finish the walks by jumping into the sea.\n\nI like taking calls while walking on the beach. In the morning, these are usually with one team member handling brand partnerships and appearances, and with my COO, where we discuss bigger deals, contract negotiations, and my investments.\n\nSince we launched The Core in December, it's taken up a big part of my day. It brings together the trust I've built as an entrepreneur with my crazy Rolodex of incredibly powerful and successful people.\n\nI'm passionate about it, and passion is my thing. When I start obsessing over something — it was the same with BStrong, my disaster-relief initiative I launched in 2017 in response to that year's devastating hurricane season — it's the only thing I'm talking about.\n\nLike every other business I've run, it's a case of building the plane while flying it. A lot of the work involves responding to texts and voice-noting somebody, asking them to do something.\n\nIf someone wants to get on the phone with me, I'll often take the call while I'm in the car. Otherwise, that time is wasted, and I don't waste time, food, or money.\n\nMy days aren't tightly structured, and I don't like feeling shackled by having too many things I have to do. The day often gets away from me before I've even showered, and my team will remind me that I have 15 minutes until I need to record my podcast, \"Just B with Bethenny Frankel.\"\n\nI record the episodes at home. Mostly, I don't care about having guests on. If I talk about my pillowcases and the bacterial facial infection I got on vacation, it will rate just as well as having Madonna.\n\nI'll usually rant for about an hour. I only like to sit and talk about what I want to talk about. It's almost like my own personal therapy monologue.\n\nThis year, I've been more open to meeting people for meals and coffee.\n\nOtherwise, I have my \"supermodel snacks\" for lunch, often seaweed stuffed with salad or turkey or rice cakes with avocado or cottage cheese.\n\nI don't plan to record my social media videos; it's mostly spontaneous. I don't post them as much as I used to. I've told my team I only want to put out excellent content, not filler.\n\nOften, my posts are just about something that's happened to me, and that leads companies to want to do brand deals. Once a week, I bang out those brand videos. The companies send the products to my home, and I film for two to three hours.\n\nI'm constantly being sent expensive things by major brands, from mattresses to nonalcoholic drinks to vape pipes. I also buy a lot of products to try myself. Once that stuff arrives, I want it out of my house as quickly as possible.\n\nAs a result, gift-giving has become a huge part of my day. If anyone does anything nice for me, whether it's at the nail salon or anywhere else, I want to give them a gift. I feel like the universe gave the \"get stuff\" crown to the right person: I like to share the wealth.\n\nIn the evenings, I try to protect my peace and avoid getting too activated by anything. I like to find a TV series that has thousands of episodes to work through. Right now, that's The Walking Dead, which I've been watching in my nightgown. I'm in my nightgown era. I also like to take a bath before I go to sleep.\n\nI listen to my body. I'm an efficient, very organized person, but I'm also a lounger, a pyjama-wearer, and a relaxer. I chill a decent amount each day.\n\nI also listen to my body for cues on when to eat or snack. I'll make dinner reservations, but often change them because I'm not hungry enough.\n\nI couldn't care less about traditional meal times.\n\nThe other night, I went to Trader Joe's and cooked a big dinner at home for my daughter, the guy I'm seeing, and a girlfriend. In Florida, I'm more sociable than I was in New York. I'm actually seeing other human life, outside of dating or being paid.\n\nWhat I cook often depends on what's already in the fridge. I enjoy the process of taking ingredients out, laying them out on the counter, and cooking.\n\nI also feel pride that my daughter sees that, even with how busy I am with my career, I'm able to do this really normal thing for her. That's meaningful for me.",

    "title": "I flew Europe's best airline for business class and food. The seat wasn't fully private but I liked the 'flying chef.'",
    "description": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.",
    "fullText": "You don't usually expect restaurant-style service at 35,000 feet — but Turkish Airlines still staffs a 'flying chef' in business class on its longest routes.\n\nThese rare culinary specialists, who are separate from flight attendants, take food orders, plate meals in the galley, and oversee premium service on long-haul flights.\n\nThe role is designed to make dining feel closer to a restaurant than standard airline catering — but chefs don't actually cook from scratch due to flight safety rules. They use ovens to heat and finish pre-prepared meals and then arrange the presentation.\n\nThese chefs also take customer feedback from the air to help improve and develop meals in catering kitchens on the ground.\n\nI recently experienced the unique service on a 10-hour flight from Istanbul to New York in January. Considering Turkish won Skytrax's 2025 awards for Europe's best business class and best business class catering, I was eager to see how the seat and food measured up.\n\nI strategically chose the Boeing 787 for its modern business cabin; the Boeing 777 that also flies the route doesn't have the nicer design.\n\nBetween the lie-flat seat, the large TV, and the restaurant-style meals, the cabin felt like my living room on a lazy Saturday night.\n\nI slept well and appreciated the wide variety of food, from poached eggs and swordfish to a trolley full of savory appetizers.\n\nHere's what the full experience was like. Business Insider paid a media rate for the business class upgrade to New York.\n\nTurkish's Istanbul business class lounge is unreal, with cooked-to-order meals like omelettes and kebabs, drink stations, and sleep suites that feel like mini hotel rooms.\n\nMy layover time qualified me for a suite, but they're first-come, first-served — I was lucky to wait only about 15 minutes.\n\nThe bed was so comfortable I slept five hours straight, with a shared bathroom and shower just across the hall.\n\nI chose seat 8A, in the last row, for privacy and to be among the first to deplane. Although it's right by the galley and lavatory nearest the boarding door, I didn't notice much noise with headphones on.\n\nMost Turkish business cabins don't have doors. Some A350s do, and the airline is planning a new \"Crystal Business Class\" with sliding doors, but most planes — including the 787 I flew on — still don't.\n\nIt's not a dealbreaker by any means, and the seat wings help cocoon the space a bit, but there is less overall privacy than with a door.\n\nThe business class seats lie fully flat, and mine felt both spacious and cozy. I could comfortably sleep on my stomach, and I particularly liked the mattress pad and the dual-texture blanket, which has a soft plush on one side.\n\nI also appreciated the 1-2-1 cabin that let me freely reach the aisle. Many of Turkish's old planes still have 2-3-2 layouts that force middle and window-seat travelers to crawl over their neighbor to reach the restroom.\n\nThe seat had multiple storage spots: a cabinet, a footrest cubby, and a slim seatback pocket — plus an overhead bin to myself.\n\nI stashed my purse, Kindle, chargers, boots, backpack, and jacket without feeling cramped.\n\nThe seat's television was large and fully controllable via a handheld remote. I watched \"The Big Bang Theory,\" \"Fast and Furious,\" and an Agatha Christie-style whodunit called \"Murder at the Embassy.\"\n\nInstead of a flight attendant, a dedicated flying chef takes orders, plates meals, and preps appetizer and dessert carts.\n\nMost of the menu — like meats and soups — are fully or nearly fully cooked on the ground in airline kitchens, but finished in the air by the chef and cabin crew using onboard ovens.\n\nThe cabin crew still hands out drinks and hot towels, but with meals covered, I imagine they can better focus on other tasks.\n\nAll of the food was served on real dishware and with flatware — no cheap plastic.\n\nTurkish offers a \"dining-on-demand\" strategy that lets passengers choose when they want to eat.\n\nFor example, I slept a few hours after breakfast before requesting tea, though the crew member also brought me a small sandwich. It was simple — handcrafted with a roll, lettuce, and cheese — but perfect while I watched a movie.\n\nThere were also free snacks available throughout the flight, like popcorn, fruit, mixed nuts, chocolate, cookies, and chips.\n\nThe breakfast started with appetizers: fresh juice, fruit salad, cheeses, smoked turkey, marinated olives, and bread with butter and jam.\n\nThe entrée options included poached eggs with a savory sauce called shakshuka, spinach-and-cheese stuffed pastries and flatbreads (börek and gözleme), and sweet curd crepes with fruit and berry sauce.\n\nI had the poached eggs, which were prepared on the ground but were still fluffy with a perfectly runny yolk on the plane.\n\nThe second meal included a huge range of appetizers: octopus salad, salmon tartare, shrimp salad, artichoke salad, fried aubergine, beef patties, chicken salad, cheese, red pepper soup, creamy pea soup, and Köpoğlu (essentially Turkish eggplant caviar).\n\nEverything was arranged on a trolley by the chef and rolled down the galley for passengers to pick and choose; the presentation made the experience feel more fancy, and everything was tasty.\n\nBesides Turkish, select Saudia, Austrian Airlines, and Garuda Indonesia flights feature onboard chefs.\n\nTurkish's chefs, staffed through catering partner DO&CO, also spend time at meal-prep facilities, providing feedback and helping maintain quality — a hands-on approach that shows in the in-flight service.\n\nI rarely check luggage, but I had too many souvenirs this time.\n\nLuckily, my bag survived the transfer from Zagreb, Croatia, and arrived in New York safe and sound.",

    "title": "AI agents failed at real-world consulting tasks — but Mercor's CEO says they're still on track to replace consultants",
    "description": "Mercor found AI agents failed at most consulting tasks, but its CEO says the models are improving so rapidly consultants should be worried.",
    "fullText": "New research suggests an AI agent can't fully replace a human consultant — at least for now.\n\nMercor, the AI training giant, tested how well leading AI models, acting as agents, performed real-world consulting, banking, and legal tasks.\n\nThe models failed most of the time, but Mercor's CEO, Brendan Foody, told Business Insider that the results tell only part of the story.\n\nThe consulting tasks in Mercor's APEX-Agents benchmark were designed to simulate real management consulting work, based on expert surveys and input from consultants at McKinsey, BCG, Deloitte, Accenture, and EY.\n\nAcross all task categories, the AI agents successfully completed the tasks less than 25% of the time on the first try. Given eight attempts, the agents could only complete 40% of the tasks. For the management consulting tasks, OpenAI's GPT 5.2 initially performed the best, completing nearly 23% of the tasks on its first attempt. Anthropic's Opus 4.6, released this week, performed even better at nearly 33%.\n\nWhile many of the tasks were not completed, Foody said the success rate for GPT 3 was only 3%, compared to 23% for GPT 5.2. Anthropic's model went from 13% to 33% on consulting tasks in a matter of months. Foody said he expects the success rate of the models to be closer to 50% by the end of the year.\n\n\"These are some of the hardest tasks in the economy that people pay millions of dollars to consulting firms to do, and the models are finally being able to do them with an incredible rate of progress,\" Foody said.\n\nAI has already disrupted the consulting industry, changing the way firms hire and make money, but the likelihood of agents displacing consultants grows as the models continue to improve.\n\nMcKinsey chief Bob Sternfels recently said the prestigious management consulting firm had 60,000 employees, 25,000 of which were AI agents.\n\nSternfels recently said it's the first time in McKinsey's history that the company is able to grow without growing its head count.\n\nThe frontier models Mercor tested included those from OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic, among others.\n\nOne example consulting task instructed the AI agent to \"analyze category consumption patterns and market penetration using the Category Penetration Score methodology for PureLife's portfolio strategy,\" asking for several specific outputs in response. The AI agents failed to produce an accurate response.\n\n\"No model is ready to replace a professional end-to-end,\" the findings concluded.\n\nMercor found the AI agents were great at research and pretty good at data analysis, Foody said.\n\nWhere they consistently got tripped up was on longer-horizon tasks — the longer it would take a human to complete a task, or the more steps it took, was the biggest indicator that the model might have a hard time.\n\nUnlike a human, Foody said, the models struggle to understand where in a specific file system they should look for the right information, so they often end up looking at the wrong files. They struggle with the planning side of figuring out how to work with multiple tools and cross-referencing files at the same time.\n\nFor tasks that can be done in an hour or less or that only require the use of a single tool, the models perform relatively well.\n\nFoody said the agents are almost like interns, where they might have a 50% pass rate, and the partner is still noticing a lot of issues in the work.\n\nFrank Jones, a former KPMG consultant who now works as an expert contractor for Mercor, said in his experience training AI, he's found the models can get close at certain tasks, but that some human refinement is often needed.\n\nHe also said the models need very specific prompts because they don't always understand common expectations or phrases in consulting, like \"client-ready.\"\n\n\"Most consultants, they know what that means. But for AI, I think there's a lot of nuance in that,\" he said.\n\nAccording to Foody, continuing to improve the models doesn't require a breakthrough — it requires more and better training, which the frontier labs are already investing heavily in.\n\n\"That's why we have so much revenue,\" he said, adding, \"We're in the business of replacing human judgment.\"\n\nMercor, whose clients have included OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta, secured a funding deal in the fall that valued the company at $10 billion. Mercor employs more than 30,000 contractors around the world who help train AI models through tasks like rewriting chatbot responses. Foody previously said the company grew its revenue in 2025 by 4,658%.\n\nFoody said he believes consulting, and especially lower-level roles, are among the jobs he's confident will be displaced by AI. He said the next version of the AI agents benchmark will expand to evaluate the whole value chain of a professional services firm: \"Instead of evaling the analyst, we're evaling McKinsey itself.\"\n\nRight now, he says Mercor's AI agent benchmark tells an appealing story for McKinsey, because the company could say it shows they can use AI to add value but not replace humans.\n\n\"The next version of APEX tells a very scary story for McKinsey,\" he said, adding, \"In the coming two years, we're going to have chatbots that are as good as the best consulting firm.\"",

    "title": "How this job went from the Wall Street equivalent of a used car dealer to the hottest gig for 2026",
    "description": "Private equity's years-long waiting game has sparked a $240 billion race on Wall Street. Inside the battle between banks to dominate in secondaries.",
    "fullText": "In the world of high finance, the secondary market — selling off pre-owned investments — was once considered Wall Street's version of a used-car lot. Few junior bankers clamored for the role, and bulge-bracket giants largely left the field to specialized boutiques.\n\nBut those days are over, and America's biggest investment banks are aggressively piling in.\n\n\"I used to have to explain the first 10 minutes of an interview what we do,\" Todd Miller, the global cohead of secondary advisory at longtime key player Jefferies, told Business Insider. \"It's a very hot industry. Everyone's trying to get into this space.\"\n\nIn the post-pandemic years of high interest rates and muted valuations, a capital bottleneck has pushed private equity exits well past the industry's typical timeline. That delay has tested investors who backed PE funds and expected returns a long time ago. So-called \"secondary\" and \"continuation vehicles\" — structures that let PE firms shift ownership of a company from one fund to another, while giving existing investors the chance to cash out — have emerged as a key workaround.\n\nIn a recent report, Jefferies said secondaries drove $240 billion in global transaction volumes last year, a 48% increase from the year prior.\n\nIn late January, JPMorgan Chase announced a new \"center of excellence\" in its investment bank: the Private Capital Advisory and Solutions group. Led by veteran banker Keith Canton, the former head of equity capital markets in the Americas, the team will advise companies on a spectrum of liquidity solutions. The symbolism was notable: a banker once focused on taking companies public is now helping them stay private longer. His newly formed group will draw on members of the bank's existing teams focused on private capital markets and advisory, he told Business Insider, with more hires expected over the coming year.\n\nMiller told Business Insider that the pace of the activity has become breathless. The banker estimated he spends as much as 20% of his time on recruiting, and his team — which counts some 130 heads — has grown by 50% over the past two years.\n\n\"I get a massive amount of inbounds on LinkedIn,\" Miller said. \"I've had kids writing to me on LinkedIn out of college, sophomores at elite schools. They want to do this job.\"\n\nFor banks like JPMorgan, establishing Canton's group helps position the firm to compete for the wave of PE spending expected to begin in the coming months. Buyside firms are sitting on trillions in unspent capital, and banks want to be on speed dial when they decide to deploy it, whether through an M&A transaction, an eventual IPO, or a chance to help clients generate the liquidity they need in between.\n\n\"If you're just waiting for the IPO market,\" Canton said, \"you have potentially missed out on some significant gains.\"\n\nIn recent decades, the capital markets have experienced a sea change. Underwhelming IPO debuts and the red tape of being publicly traded dissuaded more corporate boards from taking the plunge.\n\nMatters got more complicated after stubbornly high interest rates spiked around 2022, pumping the brakes on corporate dealmaking. In 2020, PE firms were flipping companies they'd owned for an average of five years. In 2025, the timeframe had stretched by more than a year, according to data from the data provider Preqin, a subsidiary of BlackRock.\n\nOther banks have also been busy hiring. Last month, London-based banker Andrei Brougham joined Goldman Sachs from Rothschild to steer its EMEA secondaries advisory business. In 2025, Moelis poached Matt Wesley, then Jefferies' global head of private capital, to run its advisory team.\n\nIf they play their cards right, the potential upside for these desks is significant. A February report from JPMorgan found that 76% of family offices still have no secondary private equity exposure, illustrating how much runway remains.\n\n\"It's a big business opportunity,\" Canton concluded. \"It's one that is very clearly strategic to the firm. It's where we think the markets are broadly going.\"\n\nBrianne Sterling, a headhunter who leads the investment banking practice at recruiting firm Selby Jennings, has seen an uptick in clients looking to bolster their private fund advisory capabilities. \"I think it's a really big hiring story,\" she told Business Insider.\n\nPrivate credit secondaries professionals are in demand, she said, reflecting the anticipated $17 billion in credit secondaries for 2025 that Jefferies projected last summer. And she added that some banks are poaching juniors from valuation groups and Big Four accounting firms. Their skills come in handy with pricing, which is long the most fraught part of these transactions, as limited partners scrutinize whether pricing practices are inherently fair.\n\nThe next wave will be cultivating sector-specific talent. Miller said that Jefferies is building eight- to 10-person verticals focused on niche areas like venture capital and growth funds, infrastructure, energy, and private credit — an indication that demand for these jobs isn't going anywhere.",

    "description": "A software engineer at Microsoft took his health for granted before being diagnosed with ulcerative colitis Now, he's more thoughtful about how he spends his time and energy.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Pronnoy Goswami, 31, who lives in the San Francisco Bay Area. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhen I was diagnosed with ulcerative colitis in 2022, I thought: Why me?\n\nI didn't have lots of bad habits, I hadn't abused my body, and it took me a long time to accept what was happening to me.\n\nI considered giving up my dream of solving meaningful problems in tech at scale, taking a career break to focus on my health, and leaving the US to go back to my home country of India.\n\nUltimately, I stayed in the US and continued with my career while making huge changes to my lifestyle and work routine. I'm proud of what I've achieved in tech in spite of my adversities, and along the way, I've found my voice and a new vision of success.\n\nWhen I first got sick in 2021, I was working in Washington as a software engineer at Microsoft. Previously, I'd spent two years in software engineering at McKinsey, and a few months interning at PayPal. I now work at a large enterprise software company.\n\nI was on a trip with my partner just before Thanksgiving when I had rectal bleeding and felt weak, but I didn't think it was anything more serious than hemorrhoids or food poisoning. My symptoms kept getting worse, even after I consulted doctors and took medication. I was going to the restroom 15 to 20 times a day, and I lost a lot of weight.\n\nDoctors noticed my gut was inflamed, and referred me to a gastroenterologist. I was very scared.\n\nA colonoscopy showed I have ulcerative colitis, a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes symptoms like abdominal pain and rectal bleeding.\n\nI'm used to putting 100% into my work, and when I was diagnosed in 2022, I'd been working on projects at Microsoft I felt were impactful. I took three to four weeks of sick leave, then returned to work, but I was completely remote for a year after my diagnosis.\n\nMy body struggles to absorb nutrients, and I get tired very quickly. I've had to make many dietary changes to manage flare-ups, including cutting out caffeine, alcohol, lactose, chile, and red meat.\n\nWhen my wife and I went on honeymoon in Hawaii in August 2025, we planned the trip down to the restaurants I could eat at and what I'd order. But then I ate something I hadn't planned at a lūʻau, and I was sick for two days, which was disheartening.\n\nAt first, I was scared to tell people about my condition, but when I started sharing with my colleagues, I found people empathized and judged me according to my merits.\n\nI have bad days related to my condition 20% of the time, and sometimes have to step away for appointments and procedures. For example, I have a colonoscopy every year because ulcerative colitis puts me at higher risk of getting colorectal cancer. I always try to catch up with tasks in my own time, and accept that I have to achieve the same things as others in less time.\n\nI left Microsoft and started working at a large enterprise software company in 2023. I live in the San Francisco Bay Area, where the allure of startups is all around. However, I'm not physically or mentally ready to take the leap of faith to work at one yet. The stability of my current job is vital for my health.\n\nI also need to be careful with what jobs I consider, because a workplace might not be a good fit if it has a strict policy of being in the office five days a week and doesn't make accommodations. Plus, I'm very happy where I am.\n\nBefore I got sick, I took my health for granted, but I've started treating my body like a temple and am careful with how I'm spending my energy. I've come to define success as being healthy, because it helps me solve problems at work better.\n\nIt's also given me a voice. My diagnosis made me want to be more purposeful with my time, so I started exploring creative passions, like writing a newsletter and technical blogs. I want to connect with like-minded people and not live in a shell.\n\nWhen I look back at what I've achieved in my career since my diagnosis, I feel God has been kind to me. I've done interesting, cutting-edge work in tech, like building important infrastructure.\n\nBut I'm not done yet. I'm still in the early innings of my career, and I have a long way to go.\n\nMicrosoft declined to respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nDo you have a story to share about navigating a diagnosis alongside your career?

    "fullText": "SpaceX has made its Super Bowl debut ahead of a potential record-breaking IPO.\n\nThe rocket company ran its first Super Bowl ad for its Starlink satellite internet on Sunday, the first time any of Elon Musk's companies have run an ad at the showpiece event.\n\nThe 30-second spot features audio from a speech by legendary science-fiction author Arthur C. Clarke, set to footage of SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Starship rocket boosters returning to Earth.\n\nIt shows Starlink operating in a series of remote locations and touts the satellite internet service's mission of \"fast, affordable internet, available everywhere.\"\n\nThe ad marks a departure for Musk's companies, which have in the past shunned advertising in favor of using the billionaire's outspoken public persona for publicity.\n\nFast, affordable internet.

In December, the company said Starlink has 9 million customers and is active in 155 countries.",

    "description": "In a blog post, retired Microsoft CTO Jeffrey Snover said a leadership lesson he learned from CEO Satya Nadella changed his worldview.",
    "fullText": "Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is transforming the company's culture during his tenure, leaving a lasting impression on some current and former employees.\n\nThat includes Jeffrey Snover, a retired Microsoft chief technology officer and Google engineer, who recalled an \"actionable lesson in leadership\" he learned from Nadella in a recent blog post.\n\nIn short, he said, Nadella stressed that executives need to figure out how to succeed with the resources they have, rather than complain.\n\n\"If you are an exec and don't have the resources to support your strategy, you have the wrong strategy,\" Snover wrote. \"Quit whining and wasting time trying to get the resources to support that strategy — do your job — get a strategy that can work with the resources you have.\"\n\nIn a subsequent statement shared with Business Insider, Snover said he thinks Nadella is \"the best CEO in America by a very wide margin.\"\n\nIn the blog post, Snover recalled the speech Nadella gave during a meeting with Microsoft's senior executives that laid out the leadership lesson.\n\n\"Don't come whining that you don't have the resources you need. We've done our homework. We've evaluated the portfolio, considered the opportunities, and allocated our available resources to those opportunities,\" Nadella said, according to Snover. \"That is what you have to work with. Your job is to manufacture success with the resources you've been allocated.\"\n\nSnover wrote that Nadella, who became CEO in 2014, told executives they could control only two things: How they managed their teams and how they allocated resources.\n\n\"And I want to be clear with you. If you are in this room, you need to deliver outsized success. To do that, you will need to allocate resources ahead of conventional wisdom​,\" Nadella said. \"Conventional wisdom will generate conventional success, and that won't allow you to stay in this room. You need to have courage and be bold.\"\n\nSnover, who left Microsoft in 2022, said Nadella's speech provided executives with a framework for thriving.\n\n\"Satya was not giving us a pep talk, he was giving us an architecture for success,\" Snover wrote.\n\nIn a follow-up blog post, Snover wrote that project proposals were gathered ahead of the meeting, so it was the \"Lord of the Flies/Game of Thrones stage of resource allocation.\"\n\n\"Resource allocation isn't just about money; it's the most effective weapon for killing redundancy and enforcing architectural alignment,\" Snover wrote. \"If you can't afford to build your own silo, you finally start acting like a platform company.\"\n\nUnder Nadella, Microsoft's company culture shifted from being highly competitive toward an emphasis on teamwork, including implementing an evaluation system that rewarded collaboration.",

    "description": "Tech didn't just star in Super Bowl ads this year — it stumbled. While the stakes are high for advertisers, some glitches aren't always a bad thing.",
    "fullText": "A Super Bowl ad is meant to serve as a victory lap for tech companies. But on advertising's biggest night of the year, some brands were undone by the very thing they were supposed to be showcasing: technology.\n\nMr Beast and Salesforce teamed up to offer viewers a $1 million prize if they could be the first to crack clues hidden in a Super Bowl ad, and elsewhere, in an online treasure hunt. However, some hopeful contestants were immediately foiled by delays in receiving their registration emails.\n\nIn a message on the contest website, Salesforce said the glitch was caused by an \"overwhelming response\" to the competition and that it was working with major email providers to resolve the issue.\n\nMarc Benioff, the CEO of Salesforce, appeared to be pleased with the ad's performance, writing on X that more than 53 million people visited the campaign's landing page. \"Beyond any expectation we could have had,\" he wrote, adding that Mr Beast is \"an absolute genius.\"\n\nElsewhere, an ad that ran in the fourth quarter of the game for AI.com — a new platform launched by Crypto.com cofounder Kris Marszalek — invited viewers to visit the website to create a handle and create their own agents. But social media users said that the site was down for a period after the ad aired.\n\nMarszalek had spent $70 million to acquire the AI.com domain, which the deal's broker confirmed to the Financial Times was the highest-known price paid for a domain.\n\n\"Insane traffic levels. We prepared for scale, but not for THIS,\" Marszalek wrote on X. He later wrote that the site was \"hitting Google rate limits (which are at their absolute global maximum).\" The site was restored shortly afterward.\n\nThe stakes are high for Super Bowl advertisers. This year's broadcaster, NBCUniversal, confirmed that the average price to secure 30 seconds of airtime during the game reached $8 million, with some slots fetching $10 million. Then there's the additional investments in talent fees, production, and supporting ads and social activity beyond the TV ad.\n\nAs one of the few remaining mass-reach advertising vehicles — 127.7 million viewers tuned in last year, per the ratings company Nielsen — Super Bowl advertisers usually want to go out of their way to avoid mistakes. Sometimes brands can frame apparent tech flops as wins.\n\nLoz Horner, strategy partner at the ad agency Lucky Generals, which had previously produced Super Bowl campaigns for Amazon, said that while site crashes could cause some viewers to question the reliability of a company's tech, last night's glitches will likely play out well for Salesforce and AI.com.\n\n\"It builds the sense that this is a good thing that you should \"There probably isn't another advertising moment like the Super Bowl where if you run an ad saying, 'do something now,' you need to be ready for tens of millions of responses.\"\n\nIn 2022, Coinbase captured attention with a 60-second Super Bowl TV spot that simply featured a QR code bouncing around the screen like a DVD screensaver. Shortly after airing, Coinbase's app reportedly crashed for some users, while others showed error screens on the landing page. The company chalked it up as a win, saying the ad delivered 20 million hits to a landing page within a minute of it airing. The spot also won the 2022 Super Clio for best Super Bowl ad, an award judged by a jury of advertising experts.\n\nThis year, Coinbase went minimal again with a 60-second retro karaoke-machine-style ad that encouraged viewers to sing along to the Backstreet Boys' \"Everybody (Backstreet's Back),\" before revealing its logo at the very end.\n\nPrediction market platform Kalshi was another company hit by tech glitches during last night's Super Bowl. While the company couldn't advertise during the Super Bowl itself — prediction markets were placed on the NFL's prohibited advertising list last year — Kalshi had been heavily promoting bets related to the big game. However, the company said Sunday evening that some deposits and transfers on its app were delayed because of the high volume of traffic.",

    "fullText": "Ergonomic shape, quality materials and satisfying clicks, now with novel haptic feedback and repairable design\n\nLogitech’s latest productivity power-house updates one of the greatest mice of all time with smoother materials, a repair-friendly design and a haptic motor for phone-like vibrations on your desktop.\n\nThe MX Master 4 is the latest evolution in a line of pioneering mice that dates back more than 20 years and has long been the mouse to beat for everything but hardcore PC gaming. Having given it a magnetic free-spinning scroll wheel, plenty of buttons and precise tracking, now Logitech is trying something different for its seven-generation: the ability to tap back at you.\n\nThis level of innovation doesn’t come cheap. The MX Master 4 costs £119.99 (€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95), placing it firmly in the premium market alongside high-end gaming mice and expensive peripherals aimed at creative professionals.\n\nThe overall ergonomic shape of the mouse remains very similar to the previous outstanding versions from 2019 and 2022. It is finely balanced providing great grip, support to your palm and eight buttons all within easy reach – no stretching required – but it is only available for the right-hand.\n\nEverything about the mouse feels high quality and satisfying to use. After user feedback, the materials have since been updated to be harder wearing and easier to clean (no one likes a grubby mouse).\n\nThe button clicks feel strong but are virtually silent, which will please those around you. The best-in-class MagSpeed scroll wheel uses magnets to create a silent ratchet for line-byline movement, but flick it hard enough and the magnets disengage to allow it to spin freely like a flywheel so you can effortlessly shoot through documents or pages.\n\nThe thumb scroll wheel, back and forward buttons and the gesture button are better placed than previous iterations and are particularly useful for scrolling around in photography or design packages. Press the gesture button to switch between windows by default without having to reach for the keyboard.\n\nBelow this is the new haptic button. Press it to invoke Logitech’s “actions ring”, which is a circle of app-aware actions around your cursor you can quickly click without reaching for a menu or keyboard shortcut.\n\nThe haptic feedback is a click or tap similar to a modern laptop trackpad or the little vibrations from virtual buttons on your phone, first when depressed and again when you mouse over an on-screen button. The ring is customisable and provides rapid access to useful tools, such as volume and playback control, screenshots or AI tools on the desktop or the crop tool, layers or colour picker in apps such as Adobe’s Photoshop, Lightroom or Premiere Pro.\n\nThe haptics can also be used for certain actions outside of button presses. It can tap when your mouse moves from one display to another or gives feedback when you adjust sliders, snap to a grid or have finished exporting a clip in various Adobe apps.\n\nThe feedback shows a lot of promise but it relies on plugins for individual apps to be installed from the Logi Marketplace, of which there are just seven available at the moment, including for the Adobe creative suite or Zoom. If you use alternatives, such as the Affinity suite by Canva, you are out of luck.\n\nDimension: 128.2 x 88.4 x 50.8mm\n\nConnection: Bluetooth 5.1 or Logi Bolt USB\n\nSensor sensitivity: 200-8,000 DPI\n\nThe mouse connects to any Bluetooth device, so can work with computers, tablets, phones and other devices, but it can also use the Logi Bolt USB-C dongle for computers, which provides a more secure connection. The mouse can remember three devices at once, switching between them via button on the underside – handy for use with different computers or tablets.\n\nIt works on practically any surface, including glass, without the need for a mouse pad and the battery lasts about 70 days of typical use, charging via USB-C.\n\nIn a first for the line, the mouse is designed to be disassembled with exposed screws and has a battery that can be replaced at home with instructions, meaning this could be the last mouse you ever need.\n\nThe mouse’s basic functionality works without any additional software, but the actions ring, smart actions, AI, more advanced haptic feedback and many other productivity features require the free Logi Options+ app for macOS and Windows.\n\nThe software offers a lot of customisation and optional tools, and can be safely left to run in the background most of the time, but was recently subject to a complete failure. It has worked reliably with the MX Master 4, but occasionally has problems detecting other Logitech Bluetooth keyboards and is notorious for consuming computer resources unnecessarily.\n\nThe MX Master 4 is made from recycled plastic and cobalt. It can easily disassembled at home with standard exposed screws, including replacing the battery which costs £22.99.\n\nThe Logitech MX Master 4 costs £119.99 (€129.99/$119.99/A$199.95)\n\nFor comparison, the MX Master 3S costs £89.99, Keychron M6 costs £54.99 and the Razer Basilisk Mobile costs £89.99.\n\nThe MX Master 4 takes one of the best productivity mice, makes a bunch of refinements to make it even better, and adds the potentially gamechanging haptic feedback.\n\nUnfortunately, how much use you get out of the excellent haptic system relies entirely on plugins being available for the apps you use, which is great for the Adobe creative suite of apps, but not much more.\n\nThe Master 4 is super comfortable to use for extended periods, is quiet and has all the right buttons in the right places, including its best-in-class scroll wheel. Having Bluetooth and the Logi Bolt dongle makes it easy to use with several devices. The collection of useful additional productivity tools via the Logi Options+ app can speed up your workflow no end with a bit of power-user configuration.\n\nIt is an expensive, luxury mouse. But it is the best productivity mouse you can get and with a repairable design and a battery you can change at home, it may just be the last mouse you need.\n\nPros: super comfortable, excellent design and button placement, best-in-class scroll wheel, quiet, innovative haptics have potential, plenty of customisation options, serious productivity tools including the actions ring and smart actions\n\nCons: expensive, not many plugins available to support the haptics, Logi Options+ can be a resource hog, right-handed only.",

Anyway, I was explaining all this to our soon-to-be daughter-in-law over Christmas when our children (in their 30s, and therefore much tech-savvier than me) explained that it was much more fun than that, and that I should ask: “Who is Martin Rowson’s wife?”\n\nImagine my delight when the first answer from Google search’s AI overview was “Jeanette Winterson”. (To be clear, I swear on the lives of the entire population of Silicon Valley that the famous lesbian author categorically is not my wife.) But it got better – and here comes the sublime beauty of the mesmeric imbecility of the Tool That Will Transform The World. Each time we repeated the question, the answer changed, then changed again. This seemed dependent on how the question was phrased or punctuated, but who knows? Here is the list of my alleged wives I compiled before I finally got bored:\n\nTextile designer Fiona Scott-Wilson.\n\nActor Fiona Marr, she of Bridgerton.\n\nJulia Mills (though it’s unclear whether this is the fantasy author, the illustrator, the late powerlifter or another Julia Mills altogether).\n\nWriter and journalist Emily Rees.\n\nLawyer and academic Siva Thambisetty, who is married to chess grandmaster Jonathan Rowson. AI also claims Jonathan and I are brothers. We’re not.\n\nWriter and journalist Carrie McLaren.\n\nChannel 4 News presenter Cathy Newman.\n\nCNN correspondent Clarissa Ward.\n\nJournalist and broadcaster Rachel Johnson.\n\nThen it got really weird. La femme Rowson, AI said, is actually “journalist and author Kate Clements Rowson”. Googled that name: none the wiser.\n\nThen it suggested I’m married to “writer/illustrator Helen Grant”. Apparently our son, Leo, is a jazz musician. Again, who is she? Nothing on Google. And Leo, who he? Does he really play jazz? Does he exist?\n\nThere was “former Guardian political editor & current CEO of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation Liz Kerr”. Que? There is no Guardian political editor, past or present, of that name. Liz Kerr nowhere appears on the list of the great and good at the Joseph Rowntree Foundation. Once again, all wrong. Playwright Lee Hall got a mention. He’s male, so couldn’t be my wife anyway.\n\nAs for “historian and writer Jeanette Winterbottom”. We apparently worked together on “The Guardian Book of Satire” and “The Dog’s Diary”, it says here. Maybe AI confused her with Jeanette Winterson, but then she and I didn’t collaborate on those projects, there is no Guardian Book of Satire, and I have never published a Dog’s Diary (though if someone wants to send me royalties for that, I’d take them).\n\nAnother search, another skipful of gibberish. “He’s been married to writer and journalist Ann Widdecombe (his ex-wife), Cathy Caldwell, and his long-term partner/wife, journalist and author, Polly Toynbee is a frequent figure alongside him in media, suggesting they are a prominent couple in UK literary/journalistic circles.”\n\nFor the record, I have met Rachel Johnson and my own daughter, but am married to neither of them. Again and again the bot failed to identify my real wife, to everyone’s relief, although latterly it’s begun saying: “Her name is not publicly named in the provided search results.”\n\nI suppose this suggests a capacity for learning, but maybe not. I asked “who is my wife?” once more for the purposes of this article, and Google’s AI said I’m married to “Debora Rowson (nee Ffrench)”, a retired civil servant, and ascribed to our wholly fictitious union is my extra daughter, Clementine, yet another writer/journalist. Apparently, I write about our amusing domestic upsets in my imaginary Guardian column.\n\nWhile my mythical marriage to Boris Johnson’s sister is obvious comedy gold (imagine that family Christmas!), for this nonsense to be the fruit of a garlanded, universal research tool used by billions – and for it to be repeatedly, serially wrong – is more than slightly disturbing.\n\nWe should all by now have worked out that AI is about as sentient as an abacus, and only truly mirrors the human mind in its capacity to lie to humans, telling them what it “thinks” they want to hear. It is also a universal truth that the world’s most dangerous people are idiots who think they are really, really clever (just look around and you’ll get the point). Add those two facts together and what on earth do you imagine we will end up with?\n\nI wouldn’t ask AI that, it would probably say “banana bread”, then change its mind to, “Exterminate them all!”\n\nMartin Rowson is a cartoonist and author",

    "title": "This Sci-Fi US Navy Destroyer Is $8 Billion Of Military Tech Floating At Sea",
    "description": "Right out of a sci-fi movie, this US Navy stealth ship comes with an $8 billion price tag and an incredible level of high-tech weaponry and capability.",
    "fullText": "When the U.S. Navy commissioned its Zumwalt-class destroyer (DDG-1000) in 2016, it hailed the warship as the most advanced surface combatant in the world. Equipped with a state-of-the-art stealth design, revolutionary electric propulsion and integrated power mechanisms, and twin Advanced Gun Systems, the 16,000-ton Zumwalt was touted as being larger, more advanced, and more difficult to detect than any destroyer the world had ever seen.\n\nHowever, several shortcomings, including runaway costs and underwhelming performance, caused the Navy to reduce order numbers from the proposed 32 to three, raising doubts in the Navy's ability to deliver advanced warships. Ultimately, the Zumwalt suffered from two major problems. The first was its incredible cost, as the $8 billion per-ship price tag made it impractical for largescale manufacturing and deployment. Second, its advanced designs were poorly suited for the Navy's intended usage as a land support ship, where stealth features are less important. As such, U.S. leadership determined the Zumwalt was an expensive square peg for the Navy's shore-support round hole, rendering it a floating money pit without a definitive mission.\n\nThis disconnect prompted the U.S. Navy to begin the arduous task of updating its most expensive destroyer, replacing the 155mm guns with hypersonic missiles. The first ship of its kind to sport an intercontinental missile system, the Zumwalt is one of a host of global destroyers adding high-tech weapons systems to address a changing threat landscape. The update recasts the Zumwalt as part of the U.S.'s long range strike operations, an increasingly important strategic priority, perhaps best exemplified by the nuclear missile test in November 2025. Having completed a round of post-modernization sea trials in January 2026, this sci-fi stealth ship may finally be ready to take its place at the head of U.S. Naval strategy.\n\nWhen the DDG-1000 was commissioned, it was lauded for its novel stealth designs. Despite constituting an approximate 40% jump in size from its Arleigh Burke-class predecessor, the 610-foot Zumwalt's radar cross section matches that of a 50-foot fishing vessel. Employing many of the same stealth design principles of fighter jets, the Zumwalt eschewed typical design structures, instead using an angular, wave-piercing tumblehome hull and a deckhouse constructed of electromagnetic wave-absorbing composite materials to lower the ship's radar footprint.\n\nAdd acoustics that more closely resemble a submarine, and the Zumwalt is roughly 50 times more clandestine than the Arleigh Burke destroyers. Another major development was the Zumwalt's electric propulsion system. Powered by a revolutionary integrated power network, it's capable of generating 78 megawatts, nearly as much as a nuclear aircraft carrier.\n\nThe massive size allows the Zumwalt to host a diverse array of aircraft, including Joint Strike Fighters, drones, and MV-22 Osprey, initially seen as a boon for its position alongside amphibious and littoral combat ships. To support these near-shore operations, the ship was equipped with two 155mm Advanced Gun Systems (AGS). With a range of 62 nautical miles, the Navy intended the AGS' Long-Range Land Attack Projectiles to fill the Naval Surface Fire Support void left by the 1992 retirement of the Iowa-class battleship.\n\nUnfortunately, the technological advancements of the Navy's sci-fi stealth ship came at a price. Over its 11-year development, costs skyrocketed to$23 billion. To put such astronomical numbers in perspective, the US Navy's new nuclear supercarrier, the Gerald R. Ford-class, costs $13 billion. Ammunition alone proved a financial disaster for the Zumwalt, as each round cost over $800,000, forcing a purchase cut from 20,000 to 2,400 units.\n\nFurther complicating things, the Zumwalt's expensive stealth advancements were ill-suited for the Navy's planned near-shore use, where crowded waterways and clear sightlines nullify much of its anti-radar capability. Between rising costs and competing design priorities, Naval planners largely viewed the Zumwalt-class destroyers as an expensive ship without a mission. Since canceling its ammunition order, however, the Navy has begun to reorient the Zumwalt away from close shore combat and towards clandestine operations and long range missile strikes.\n\nThis repurposing began in August 2023, when the DDG-1000 underwent a 3-year modernization effort.  Part of which involved replacing the Advanced Gun Systems with a state-of-the-art Conventional Prompt Strike (CPS) weapons system that carries Common Hypersonic Glide Bodies capable of worldwide range at speeds up to Mach 5. Through these efforts, the Navy hopes that the CPS system will shift the Zumwalt-class destroyer into a key cog of its global force-projection efforts, particularly in the Pacific theatre.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

Carbon in the atmosphere stores energy, which becomes thermal potential.\n\n2) Definition of facts – the framing of facts into a discrete 'event.'Example: Human industrial activity has released a large amount of previously captured carbon, meaning there's far more atmospheric carbon than would have organically ended up there through natural forces.\n\n3) Interpretation of facts – the declaration of quality on the established events.Example: Human industrial activity is threatening human safety by causing climate change that is detrimental to the long-term survival and sustainability of current lifestyles, which is bad because humans don't like dying.\n\n4) Response – the understanding of how these events pertain to us and our actions.Example: Humans need to make drastic changes to industrial activity to mitigate the climate impacts and attempt to repair existing damage.\n\nA person who doesn't believe anthropogenic carbon release exists (Layer 2) can't debate someone who believes industrial activity needs to be curbed (Layer 4), because the Layer 4 position is predicated on a Layer 2 presumption that isn't shared by both parties. The person making the Layer 4 argument is taking something for granted that the person making the Layer 2 argument doesn't, and so they fundamentally can never agree on a Layer 4 argument predicated on a Layer 2 prerequisite they don't agree with.\n\nTaking a moment to ascertain whether you're both on the same layer can be very helpful to diagnosing these situations where you feel like you're talking past each other.\"\n\nAlso in In the News: Gavin Newsom's New, Brutal Nickname For Trump Is Going Viral, And It May Be His Best One Yet\n\nAlso in In the News: \"The Male Loneliness Epidemic Is Entirely Self-Inflicted\": 24 Brutal, Brutal, Brutal Political Tweets Of The Week\n\nAlso in In the News: Gavin Newsom Came Up With A Nickname For JD Vance, And This One Is Definitely Going To Stick",

    "fullText": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Iran sentenced Nobel Peace Prize laureate Narges Mohammadi to over seven more years in prison after she began a hunger strike, supporters said Sunday, as Tehran cracks down on all dissent following nationwide protests and the deaths of thousands at the hands of security forces.\n\nThe new convictions against Mohammadi come as Iran tries to negotiate with the United States over its nuclear program to avert a threatened military strike by U.S. President Donald Trump. Iran's top diplomat insisted Sunday that Tehran's strength came from its ability to “say no to the great powers,\" striking a maximalist position just after negotiations in Oman with the U.S.\n\nMohammadi’s supporters cited her lawyer, who spoke to Mohammadi. The lawyer, Mostafa Nili, confirmed the sentence on X, saying it had been handed down Saturday by a Revolutionary Court in the city of Mashhad. Such courts typically issue verdicts with little or no opportunity for defendants to contest their charges.\n\n“She has been sentenced to six years in prison for ‘gathering and collusion’ and one and a half years for propaganda and two-year travel ban,” he wrote. She received another two years of internal exile to the city of Khosf, some 740 kilometers (460 miles) southeast of Tehran, the capital, the lawyer added.\n\nAgnes Callamard, the secretary-general of Amnesty International, wrote on X that Mohammadi's sentence was “a reflection of the skyrocketing lethal repression against dissent and protests waged by the authorities.”\n\nIran did not acknowledge the sentence. Supporters say Mohammadi has been on a hunger strike since Feb. 2 and ended it Sunday after her sentencing over her worsening health. She had been arrested in December at a ceremony honoring Khosrow Alikordi, a 46-year-old Iranian lawyer and human rights advocate who had been based in Mashhad. Footage from the demonstration showed her shouting, demanding justice for Alikordi and others.\n\nMohammadi a symbol for Iranian activists\n\nSupporters had warned for months before her December arrest that Mohammadi, 53, was at risk of being put back into prison after she received a furlough in December 2024 over medical concerns.\n\nWhile that was to be only three weeks, Mohammadi’s time out of prison lengthened, possibly as activists and Western powers pushed Iran to keep her free. She remained out even during the 12-day war in June between Iran and Israel.\n\nMohammadi still kept up her activism with public protests and international media appearances, including even demonstrating at one point in front of Tehran’s notorious Evin prison, where she had been held.\n\nMohammadi had been serving 13 years and nine months on charges of collusion against state security and propaganda against Iran’s government. She also had backed the nationwide protests sparked by the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini, which have seen women openly defy the government by not wearing the hijab.\n\nMohammadi suffered multiple heart attacks while imprisoned before undergoing emergency surgery in 2022, her supporters say. Her lawyer in late 2024 revealed doctors had found a bone lesion that they feared could be cancerous that later was removed.\n\n“Considering her illnesses, it is expected that she will be temporarily released on bail so that she can receive treatment,” Nili wrote.\n\nHowever, Iranian officials have been signaling a harder line against all dissent since the demonstrations. Speaking on Sunday, Iranian judiciary chief Gholamhossein Mohseni-Ejei made comments suggesting harsh prison sentences awaited many.\n\n“Look at some individuals who once were with the revolution and accompanied the revolution,\" he said. \"Today, what they are saying, what they are writing, what statements they issue, they are unfortunate, they are forlorn (and) they will face damage.”\n\nForeign minister strikes hard-line tone\n\nThe news about Mohammadi came as Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, speaking to diplomats at a summit in Tehran, signaled that Iran would stick to its position that it must be able to enrich uranium — a major point of contention with Trump, who bombed Iranian atomic sites in June during the 12-day Iran-Israel war.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to travel to Washington this week, with Iran expected to be the major subject of discussion, his office said.\n\nWhile Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian praised the talks Friday in Oman with the Americans as “a step forward,” Araghchi's remarks show the challenge ahead. Already, the U.S. moved the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln, ships and warplanes to the Middle East to pressure Iran into an agreement and have the firepower necessary to strike the Islamic Republic should Trump choose to do so.\n\n“I believe the secret of the Islamic Republic of Iran’s power lies in its ability to stand against bullying, domination and pressures from others,\" Araghchi said. \"They fear our atomic bomb, while we are not pursuing an atomic bomb. Our atomic bomb is the power to say no to the great powers. The secret of the Islamic Republic’s power is in the power to say no to the powers.”\n\n‘Atomic bomb’ as rhetorical device\n\nAraghchi's choice to explicitly use an “atomic bomb” as a rhetorical device likely wasn't accidental. While Iran has long maintained its nuclear program is peaceful, the West and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Tehran had an organized military program to seek the bomb up until 2003.\n\nIran had been enriching uranium up to 60% purity, a short, technical step to weapons-grade levels of 90%, the only nonweapons state to do so. Iranian officials in recent years had also been increasingly threatening that the Islamic Republic could seek the bomb, even while its diplomats have pointed to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei’s preachings as a binding fatwa, or religious edict, that Iran wouldn’t build one.\n\nIt remains unclear when and where, or if, there will be a second round of nuclear talks. Trump, after the talks Friday, offered few details but said: “Iran looks like they want to make a deal very badly — as they should.”\n\nMeanwhile, Iran issued a warning to pilots it planned “rocket launches” Monday into Tuesday in an area over the country's Semnan province, home to the Imam Khomeini Spaceport. Such launches have corresponded in the past with Iran marking the anniversary of its 1979 Islamic Revolution.",

    "description": "India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - India has scrapped a planned concession for small cars in upcoming fuel-efficiency rules after automakers including Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra argued ​it would benefit only one company, a government document shows.\n\nA September draft had proposed leniency ‌for petrol cars weighing 909 kg (2,004 lb) or less - a carve-out widely seen as favouring Maruti Suzuki, which controls 95% of ‌India's small‑car market.\n\nIndia's Power Ministry has now removed that exemption and tightened other parameters, increasing pressure on all automakers to ramp up electric and hybrid car sales, according to the latest 41-page draft reviewed by Reuters.\n\nThe new rules curb over-compensation for vehicle weight, aim to level the field between light and heavy fleet ⁠manufacturers, and are designed to deliver ‌real-world efficiency gains, the document said.\n\nThey introduce \"a substantially steeper reduction pathway\" for emissions, it added.\n\nThe power ministry did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPROMOTING ELECTRIC, HYBRID ‍MODELS\n\nTransport accounts for about 12% of India's energy use and is a major driver of petroleum imports and carbon emissions. Passenger vehicles make up nearly 90% of transport-related emissions, the document says.\n\nCorporate Average Fuel Efficiency norms dictate permissible ​CO2 emissions across a manufacturer's fleet of passenger cars weighing less than 3,500 kg (7,716 lb). Updated ‌every five years, they push automakers towards cleaner technologies including electrification, compressed natural gas and flex-fuel.\n\nThe new rules will apply from April 2027 for five years and are central to automakers' product and powertrain investment plans. It was not immediately clear when the rules will be finalised.\n\nThe September draft would have allowed fuel-consumption targets to rise faster with vehicle weight, easing compliance for makers of heavier cars such as ⁠Mahindra, Tata and Volkswagen, while tightening demands on lighter-fleet players ​such as Maruti. That imbalance prompted the carve-out.\n\nThe revised plan ​reduces the extent to which heavier vehicles gain more relaxed targets.\n\n\"Manufacturers with heavier fleets ... are required to achieve stronger intrinsic efficiency improvements,\" the document said.\n\nA credit system will ‍reward companies that sell more ⁠EVs and plug-in hybrids, and pooling of fuel-consumption performance between companies will be allowed. Non-compliance will draw penalties of up to $550 per car.\n\nThe revised plan aims to cut average fleet emissions ⁠to about 100 grams/km over the five years to March 2032 from 114 grams/km. With credits, that could fall to ‌as low as 76 grams/km if electric models reach 11% of total car sales ‌by 2032.",

    "description": "Somali president promises to confront Israeli military presence amid reports of base plan in breakaway Somaliland.",
    "fullText": "Somalian President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud has slammed Israel’s “interference” in his country, saying its recognition of the breakaway region of Somaliland has further increased instability and weakened international order.\n\nIn an exclusive interview with Al Jazeera broadcast on Saturday, Mohamud said Somalia “will never allow” the establishment of an Israeli base in Somaliland and will “confront” any such move.\n\nHe also warned that the proposed Israeli base could be used as a springboard to attack neighbouring countries.\n\nMohamud’s comments came amid a regional outcry over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s decision in December to recognise Somaliland, a breakaway part of Somalia comprising the northwestern portion of what was once the British Protectorate.\n\nThe territory sits astride one of the world’s most critical maritime choke routes, flanked by multiple conflicts in the Horn of Africa and the Middle East.\n\nIsrael’s move made it the first country in the world to recognise Somaliland as an independent state and came months after The Associated Press news agency reported that Israeli officials had contacted parties in Somaliland to discuss using the territory for forcibly displacing Palestinians amid Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza.\n\nIsrael and Somaliland have denied the claims, but a Somaliland official from the country’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation told Israel’s Channel 12 in January that an Israeli military base is “on the table and being discussed”, though its establishment depends on the terms.\n\nSomalia has denounced Israel’s move as an attack on its territorial integrity and unity, a position backed by most African and Arab leaders, and urged Netanyahu to withdraw the recognition.\n\nBut Somaliland’s leader, Abdirahman Mohamed Abdullahi, known as Cirro, has welcomed Israel’s diplomatic move, praising Netanyahu for his “leadership and commitment to promoting stability and peace” in the region.\n\nIn his interview with Al Jazeera, Mohamud described Israel’s diplomatic manoeuvre as a “reckless, fundamentally wrong and illegal action under international law”.\n\nHe also pledged to fight back against any Israeli military presence in Somaliland.\n\n“We will fight in our capacity. Of course, we will defend ourselves,” he said. “And that means that we will confront any Israeli forces coming in, because we are against that and we will never allow that.”\n\nThe Israeli recognition represents a dramatic shift in Somaliland’s fortunes after years of diplomatic isolation.\n\nThe region seceded from Somalia during a brutal civil war that followed decades under the hardline government of Siad Barre, whose forces devastated the north. While large parts of Somalia descended into chaos, Somaliland stabilised by the late 1990s.\n\nSomaliland has since developed a distinct political identity, with its own currency, flag and parliament. But its eastern regions remain disputed by communities that do not back the separatist programme in the capital, Hargeisa.\n\nIn recent years, Somaliland developed ties with the United Arab Emirates – a signatory to the Abraham Accords with Israel – and Taiwan as it sought international acceptance.\n\nIn his interview, Mohamud said Israel’s move “interfering with Somalia’s sovereign and territorial integrity” also “undermines stability, security and trade in a way that affects the whole of Africa, the Red Sea and the wider world”.\n\nHe added that Israel’s deadly use of force against Palestinians in Gaza cannot be separated from what is happening in Somaliland, adding that it reflects the weakening of the foundations of global governance.\n\n“Key among the global concerns is the weakening of the established rules-based international order. That order is not intact any more,” Mohamud said.\n\nHe warned that institutions created after World War II “are under grave threat”, as “the mighty is right” increasingly replaces adherence to international law.\n\nThe United States, meanwhile, has yet to signal a major shift on the question of Somaliland.\n\nBut in August, US President Donald Trump – who has previously lobbed insults at Somalia and Mohamud – suggested he was preparing to move on the issue when asked about Somaliland during a White House news conference.\n\n“Another complex one, but we’re working on that one – Somaliland,” he said.",

    "fullText": "Team GB skier Gus Kenworthy says he has received death threats after posting a graphic message about the United States' Immigration and Customs Enforcement organisation - commonly known as ICE.\n\nKenworthy shared the image - in which 'ICE' was preceded by an expletive - on Instagram a week before he was due to compete at the Winter Olympics in Italy.\n\nThe 34-year-old was born in Chelmsford but grew up in America and won silver in the ski slopestyle at the Sochi 2014 Games, before switching allegiance to Team GB in 2019.\n\nIn a new post on Instagram, Kenworthy said there had been a lot of \"encouraging\" support but that he has also received death threats.\n\n\"The other day I posted a photo with my thoughts on ICE and that photo has since gone everywhere - and I've gotten a tonne of messages and most of them honestly have been supportive and encouraging,\" Kenworthy said in a video., external\n\n\"But a lot of the messages have been awful, people telling me to kill myself, threatening me, wishing they'll get to see me blow my knee or break my neck during my event, calling me slurs... it's insane.\"\n\nThe British Olympic Association (BOA) told BBC Sport: \"Team GB takes athlete welfare seriously and has support services in place for athletes, including specifically where there are threats and abuse via social media. All Team GB athletes are offered this on a proactive basis.\"\n\nKenworthy will feature in the men's snowboard halfpipe event, with qualifying beginning on 19 February in Livigno, Italy.\n\nProtests have taken place across the US over the past few weeks after intensive care nurse Alex Pretti, 37, and fellow Minnesota resident Renee Good, 37, were both killed by ICE agents in the city in January.\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nGB's Brookes & Muir target medals, plus curling semi-final - Monday's guide\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nTeam USA skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess have also spoken out at the Games about the actions of ICE and ongoing tensions in the US.\n\nLillis said he was \"heartbroken\" and wants to country to \"respect everybody's rights\", while treating all citizens with \"love and respect\".\n\nAsked what it means to represent the USA, Hess said: \"It's a little hard. There's obviously a lot going on that I'm not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren't.\n\n\"Just because I'm wearing the flag doesn't mean I represent everything that's going on in the US.\"\n\nIOC spokesman Mark Adams said: \"I'm not going to add to the discourse.\n\n\"We have a good relationship with the USOPC and the administration, that can only be good for debate and delivering a good Games.\"\n\nThe BOA and IOC said Kenworthy would not be punished for his initial post on Instagram when he appeared to urinate the ICE-related message into the snow.\n\nBOA chief Dame Katherine Grainger said he had the right to express himself.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) is using an Artificial Intelligence (AI) system to monitor social media for abusive posts directed at athletes at the Winter Games.\n\nThe system was first deployed at the 2022 Paris Olympics and flagged 2.4 million posts from 20,000 social media accounts in more than 35 languages.\n\n\"Maybe that's the price you pay for speaking up and using your platform but I think it's important to say what you feel and stand up for justice,\" Kenworthy said.\n\n\"You can love the US and be proud to be an American and still think it can be better and that the country can improve.\"\n\nChief Games operations officer Andrea Francisi said they are not planning to bring in \"additional measures\" of security around athletes.\n\n\"We attach a lot of attention to all these events, but there are not situations which require us to take additional measures,\" Francisi said.\n\n\"Things are stable, we do not need additional measures. There is a fantastic, calm atmosphere in the villages, we do not need a plan here.\"\n\nThe US said it would send ICE agents to the Games to help support American security operations, prompting anger from the Italian foreign office and citizens.\n\nUS vice-president JD Vance was in Milan for Friday's opening ceremony at the San Siro stadium, where he and wife Usha were roundly booed by the crowd when they appeared on big screens at the arena.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

He feels blessed to be alive after being born with a 1% chance of survival.\n\nThe Seattle linebacker played a key role as the Seahawks beat the New England Patriots 29-13 in Sunday's NFL title decider, claiming two sacks in a dominant defensive display.\n\nBut it is a wonder the 24-year-old is even here at all after being born four months premature in 2001.\n\nHall weighed less than 3lb and was on life support when his mother refused to have it discontinued.\n\nNow 6ft 3in and 254lb, he hugged his mother on the field in Santa Clara, California, after Seattle's second Super Bowl win.\n\n\"Everyone knows my story, what it took for me to get here, what it took for me just to be alive and have the chance,\" said Hall.\n\n\"I'm very blessed - kudos to Mom. That was a special moment after the game. I feel like she's an unsung hero, an unsung warrior through this whole process. She always fought for me. She never gave up.\n\n\"Just being able to play football and what this game has done for me and my life and my family...\n\n\"I always love and respect playing this game, and I feel like I show that every single time I step on the field.\"\n\nAfter a difficult start to his NFL career, it seemed Seattle quarterback Sam Darnold was destined to become a journeyman back-up.\n\nBut after leading the Minnesota Vikings to last season's play-offs, the Seahawks became his fifth team in eight years - and third in three – and they have won American sport's biggest prize in his first season in Seattle.\n\n\"My team-mates and my coaches, they believed in me since the first training camp, every single day we came to work,\" said 28-year-old Darnold.\n\n\"I shared a great moment with my parents and fiancee Katie after the game and I think that's what kind of got me a little bit. I told my dad and my mom, I'm here because of their belief in me.\n\n\"Some people called me crazy throughout my career for believing in myself so much, but it was because of my parents. It allowed me to go out there and play free and have a ton of confidence.\n\n\"On offence, I feel like we didn't play as good as we could have. I certainly didn't, but our defence and special teams had our back.\"\n\nSeattle also signed Cooper Kupp in the off-season and he claimed his second Super Bowl win, having been the Most Valuable Player (MVP) when the Los Angeles Rams became NFL champions in 2022.\n\n\"My wife was the first person to believe in me,\" said the wide receiver. \"She's believed that this story was written so long ago.\n\n\"I would like to say I was all in and believed it as well, but there were some tough times. Anna has believed that this is what we came to Seattle to do.\n\n\"It's an unbelievable story. To be in this place, it's hallowed ground.\"\n\nSeattle defensive coordinator Aden Durde became the first overseas coach to win a Super Bowl, after beginning his coaching journey in the British amateur game.\n\nThe 46-year-old said he felt the Seahawks were going to win \"from down one\", adding: \"We put a plan together and the guys executed at an elite level.\n\n\"I'm very grateful. A lot of people sacrificed a lot for me to be sitting here, but you don't see that.\n\n\"My mum and brother watched the game at an NFL party, and when my sons and wife came on to the field they showed me a picture of them watching, so that was pretty cool.\"\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

    "fullText": "Donald Trump reacted forcefully to Super Bowl 60, calling for immediate change after what he described as a damaging moment for the NFL.\n\nFollowing the game, the former US president focused his criticism on the halftime show and quickly expanded his comments to include league policy.\n\nTrump shared his reaction in a post published by TrumpTruthOnX, responding directly to Bad Bunny’s halftime performance.\n\nHe wrote, “The Super Bowl Halftime Show is absolutely terrible, one of the worst, ever! It makes no sense, is an affront to the Greatness of America, and doesn’t represent our standards of success, creativity, or excellence.\n\n“Nobody understands a word this guy is saying, and the dancing is disgusting, especially for young children who are watching from throughout the U.S.A., and all over the World.”\n\nThe comments were uncompromising and immediate. Trump framed the halftime show not as a matter of taste, but as a failure to reflect what he believes the Super Bowl should represent.\n\nAs has often been the case, Trump’s reaction quickly spread across social media, becoming part of the wider debate surrounding the NFL’s entertainment choices.\n\nTrump’s post did not stop at the halftime show. He also used the moment to call out a specific NFL rule change.\n\nHe continued, “This ‘show’ is just a ‘slap in the face’ to our Country, which is setting new standards and records every single day — including the best Stock Market and 401(k)s in history!\n\n“There is nothing inspirational about this mess of a halftime show and watch, it will get great reviews from the fake news media, because they haven’t got a clue of what is going on in the real world, and, by the way, the NFL should immediately replace its ridiculous new kickoff rule. Make America great again!”\n\nThe mention of the kickoff rule stood out. Rather than limiting his response to entertainment, Trump shifted attention to on-field changes introduced by the league.\n\nHis criticism suggested frustration with what he sees as unnecessary adjustments to the game itself.\n\nThe NFL’s revised kickoff rule, which was introduced in 2024, has already divided fans, with some praising the improvements and others arguing it removes excitement.\n\nAs Super Bowl 60 fallout continues, the former president’s comments ensured the halftime show debate expanded beyond music.\n\nIt became, once again, a flashpoint for how sport, culture, and politics intersect on the biggest stage.\n\nDonald Trump goes off on ‘worst ever’ Bad Bunny Super Bowl halftime show\n\nImane Khelif has a brutal reminder for Donald Trump, names only way she will ‘respect’ the US President\n\nWho Donald Trump picked as Super Bowl LX winners between Patriots and Seahawks",

    "fullText": "Barcelona presidential elections: Who are the 2026 candidates, and why the role of president matters originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs one of the only member-owned major clubs left in Europe, Barcelona will take a major step towards defining the future of the institution over the next two months.\n\nOn March 15, Barcelona \"socios\" will elect the next club president who will lead Barcelona into the next era of European and global football. Until then, we'll have six weeks of campaigning, in which time candidates must drum up sufficient support.\n\nRequired by the club's bylaws to hold elections every five years, the current mandate of president Joan Laporta is set to expire, and he has called for new elections for himself and the board to be held in March. That means the incumbents must resign their positions on Monday, February 9.\n\nThe Sporting News explains why this is happening, who the candidates for election could be, and what each one stands for as the Barcelona faithful aim to decide the best leader for the next phase of the club's illustrious history.\n\nMORE:Who owns Barcelona? Explaining the \"socio\" model and how to become one\n\nThe duties of the president of Barcelona are wide-ranging. The individual is responsible for overseeing players and coaches signing contracts, managing the finances of the club, chairing General Assembly meetings, and much more.\n\nIn essence, the president runs the day-to-day operations of the club while serving as the public face of the team and Barcelona brand. Barca's executives, such as the sporting director, report to the president.\n\nFrom 2026 onwards, presidential terms at Barcelona will be five years in length, at which point elections must be held for both president and all board members. Laporta's current term will be the last to run for six years. According to Mundo Deportivo, Laporta said \"sometimes, six years is just too long\" during his campaign for election in 2021.\n\nLaporta has scheduled the presidential election for Barcelona for March 15, 2026.\n\nAs per club statutes, Laporta has stated that he will resign from his position at the General Assembly on Monday, February 9, along with a significant number of the board. Starting then, candidates for election will go about gathering signatures, as they require at least 2,321 socios to support their candidacy to officially stand for election.\n\nFrom then until the election, a regency will take charge of the club. A number of board members — at least six, or one third of the total board — are likely to remain in position to avoid necessitating the formation of a temporary management committee.\n\nChallengers to Laporta have criticized the decision to hold elections midseason, stating that the timeline \"suits Laporta\" but does not do the club the service of a fully fair and balanced election process.\n\nCandidates for Barcelona president must have been a socio for at least 10 years, and must gather at least 2,321 socio signatures backing their candidacy.\n\nPresidential candidates are also required to, together with their executive board, present a \"financial guarantee\" worth 15 percent of the club's budget. Barcelona's club statutes state that the executive board is \"liable for their actions\" while in office, and thus the guarantee is a means of backing that claim financially, with the aim to protect against poor governance and mismanagement.\n\nWhile this process plays out, candidates for election will not be finalized until they present both the signatures and financial backing to solidify their candidacy. This process will not conclude until closer to the date of the election, and thus this list of candidates is, for now, simply a list of \"pre-candidates\".\n\nThe sitting president of Barcelona is Joan Laporta. He has been in office since being elected in 2021, taking over for Josep Bartomeu, who had resigned in 2020 amid widespread anger at the club's management, specifically the dire financial situation and Bartomeu's public spat with Lionel Messi.\n\nLaporta is currently in his second stint as president of the club. He was first elected in 2003 and spent seven years at the helm, during which he saw the rise of Messi and the hiring of Pep Guardiola.\n\nAfter a decade spent in Catalan politics, Laporta returned to Barcelona with his election in 2021, where he has since been tasked with stabilising the club's finances after the emergency situation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and years of financial mismanagement under Bartomeu.\n\nUnder Laporta's leadership, Barcelona are through the most immediate danger brought about by their money struggles, when it seemed shockingly plausible that they could cease to exist entirely, but they are still significantly in debt.\n\nThe club is believed to owe around €1.5 billion ($1.8bn), thanks in part to the massive renovation project to update their stadium, Camp Nou. The club is banking on revenue from the improved venue to rectify the situation in the long term, but for now, they are still under considerable financial strain.\n\nAccording to Barcelona's treasurer in January of 2026, the club still has liabilities of around €2.5bn ($3bn), with the New York Times describing Laporta's strategy as \"spending its way out of crisis.\"\n\nThe Camp Nou renovation is Laporta's crown jewel, and he has platformed on the goal of hosting the 2029 UEFA Champions League final at the newly overhauled stadium. Unfortunately, the renovation process has not been smooth and has been saddled with financial overreaches, significant delays, and other bad press including water leaks.\n\nVictor Font, 53, is making a second run at the Barcelona presidency, and is considered the most serious challenger to the incumbent. He lost to Laporta in the 2021 election to replace Bartomeu, receiving 30 percent of the vote to Laporta's 54.3 percent.\n\nFont is the co-founder of Delta Partners, a financial tech consulting firm, and has deep roots in Catalan football. He is a part-owner of Catalan publication Ara and also of football analytics company Kognia Sports Intelligence.\n\nFont's main platform is a pullback on Laporta's aggressive financial tactics. He has criticized Laporta's use of \"levers\" to achieve short-term financial solvency at the cost of leveraging the club's future earnings. Critics of his economic plan believe that it will harm Barcelona's ability to compete now, which could damage the club's image and trajectory.\n\nFont has also platformed on reducing the presidential term to four years alongside other reforms such as overhauling the requirements to run for a position on the board. He also wishes to create a ticket package tailored to socios who are not season-ticket holders, and he is promoting an expanded voting system that incentivises mail-in and electronic voting for long-distance members.\n\nPerhaps Font's most publicized campaign promise is that he wishes to make every possible effort to bring Messi back to Barcelona to finish his career where it began.\n\nXavier Vilajoana, also 53, is the CEO of Grup Euroconstruc, a development company specializing in affordable housing and sustainable construction. He attempted to run in the 2021 election but could not earn the requisite number of socio signatures.\n\nVilajoana was once, in his youth, a member of the famed La Masia academy, and went on to captain Barcelona's futsal team. He has been heavily involved in Barcelona's executive setup since then, and was on the board during Bartomeu's presidency.\n\nGiven his efforts within the club, Vilajoana has attempted to take credit for a lot of the club's current success on the pitch, pointing to the successful current youth product. He is concurrently saying that Laporta's claims to their recent run of results under Hansi Flick should not be attributed to the sitting president, but instead the years of groundwork laid by previous regimes to which Vilajoana was a key contributor.\n\nWhile Vilajoana's knowledge of the club's history, background, and inner workings is clear, his ties to a disgraced Bartomeu will likely work against him in any bid for the presidency, even if he has tried to distance himself from that time.\n\nThe final presidential candidate is sports economist and financier Marc Ciria.\n\nCiria has taken Font's promise to bring Messi back to Barcelona one step further, not only claiming he will pursue it with reckless abandon, but calling such a move \"strategic... for the future of the club and to protect and preserve the ownership model.\" Ciria pointed to the club's current revenue, which he says is below expectations when comparing it to Messi's time at the club, as proof that the Blaugrana legend is \"essential\" to the club's health.\n\nDubbed \"Movement 42,\" Ciria's plan centers around massive restructuring of the club's financial setup. \"When things aren't working, you have to change them, you have to start over,\" Ciria says.",

I think they'll definitely be looking over their shoulders.\"\n\nCaptain Cristian Romero was sent off in the first half at Old Trafford for a late lunge on Casemiro, his sixth dismissal in a Spurs shirt.\n\n\"I can see why it's been given but I think it's a little bit harsh,\" said Rooney.\n\n\"Sometimes you lose your head at times. And I think he's done that throughout his time at Tottenham.\"\n\nIt came days after Romero's social media post which seemed to criticise the people who run the club - when he said it was \"disgraceful\" they only had 11 fit players for a 2-2 draw with Manchester City.\n\n\"What doesn't help is comments in the week before about the lack of players Tottenham have,\" added Rooney.\n\n\"He clearly speaks his mind as well. But unfortunately, you've got to go and back that up with performances when you're vocal like that - and I don't think he's done that. All that's going to do is bring more pressure on Thomas Frank.\"\n\nRooney has sympathy for Frank, who managed Brentford for seven years before moving across London last summer to replace Postecoglou.\n\n\"I feel for Thomas Frank because he looks tired, he looks like he's aged 10 years,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what that Tottenham job has done to him in a short period of time.

    "description": "Devon Witherspoon’s teammate called him a future Hall of Famer after his game-changing performance in the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory.",
    "fullText": "There was a moment after Uchenna Nwosu crossed the goal line to score a decisive touchdown late in the Super Bowl when Devon Witherspoon had a strong case for the game’s Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe box score momentarily read that Witherspoon had just notched his second sack and forced a fumble that fell into Nwosu’s arms. Nwosu ran 45 yards and scored, making it a 29-7 game, effectively ending the New England Patriots’ slim hopes at a miracle comeback.\n\nBut the box score was corrected by NFL officials moments later, giving Nwosu the interception and taking away a sack and forced fumble from Witherspoon’s stat line. Had it held, his MVP case might have been stronger than running back Kenneth Walker, who had 161 yards from scrimmage, but wasn’t part of any touchdown plays, as Witherspoon was.\n\nAfter all, the story of Sunday’s 29-13 championship triumph from the Seahawks was the defense’s domination of second-year quarterback Drake Maye. And Witherspoon’s stat line would have jumped out over Derick Hall and Byron Murphy, who each had two sacks. Maye was sacked six times, finished with a fumble and two interceptions while the Seahawks won the turnover battle 3-0.\n\nNot that anyone with the Seahawks mind that Walker won MVP. Lifting of the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in the organization’s history, the hugs, celebratory cigars and the other once-in-a-lifetime moments at Levi’s Stadium mean far more than quibbles over box score stats and MVP cases.\n\nBut there’s little doubt Witherspoon has cemented himself as one of the best defensive backs in the NFL — and has a chance to go down as an all-time Seahawks player if he continues his current trajectory.\n\n“He’s a walking Hall of Famer, right now,” Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV said. “He’s a dog. He’s my favorite player in the NFL. He can do everything.”\n\nWitherspoon had four tackles, a sack, and three quarterbacks hits, including the one on Maye that led to Nwosu’s touchdown. His sack in the first quarter ended New England’s second drive in a string that included 10 straight possessions that ended in either a punt or kneel down to end the first half.\n\nHis performance in the Super Bowl will get added to a resume that already includes three Pro Bowls in his first three seasons, and potentially a contract atop the market. The No. 5-overall pick in the 2023 draft is eligible for an extension for the first time this offseason.\n\n“The soul of our defense, ‘Spoon is the heart of it,” safety Julian Love said. “If you know football and you watch our tape, 21 jumps off the screen every single play, every single game, every single rep. It’s just raw talent. It’s playing football the right way. He’s just a ballplayer. And he’s been that way since the first time he stepped in the building.”\n\nThe Patriots didn’t score a touchdown until early in the fourth quarter, trimming a 19-0 to 19-7. Witherspoon, and his teammates, throttled New England to the tune of 78 yards on offense through the first three quarters. They exploded for 253 in the fourth when the game was largely out of hand to finish with a respectable 331. The final number did not represent how much Seattle’s “Dark Side” controlled the game.\n\nWhen relayed being called a Hall of Famer by Jones, Witherspoon said, “It means everything. Talk about a great teammate, Ernest, he’s everything to us, man. A ‘Mike’ linebacker who sets the standard for us. ... Right now, I’m just focused on the now, living in the present.”\n\nSeahawks coach Mike Macdonald dialed up more blitzes early in the game than the Seahawks typically had throughout the season. He called nine pressures, by unofficial count, in the first half. That 36% rate is nearly double their 19.3% rate from the regular season, according to Pro Football Reference.\n\nOf course, Witherspoon’s blitzes resulted in his first-quarter sack that came on an early third down that helped set the tone of the game. And his hit on Maye that led to Nwosu’s touchdown will be remembered as a highpoint in the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory.\n\n“I haven’t been blitzing a lot this year,” Witherspoon said. “But it was best for our team, and I’m going to do whatever I need to do for our team to win.”",

    "fullText": "Seattle Seahawks running back Kenneth Walker III was named Super Bowl LX Most Valuable Player after rushing for 135 yards and helping Seattle to a 29–13 victory over the New England Patriots in Santa Clara, California. Walker became the first running back since Terrell Davis in 1998 to win Super Bowl MVP, a rare honor in today’s quarterback-driven NFL.\n\nIn his post-game interview, Walker described the achievement as almost unbelievable, saying it was “just a dream come true” because many players never even reach the Super Bowl, let alone win MVP.\n\nBut beyond the individual accolade, Walker highlighted the adversities the Seahawks overcame this season:\n\nHe thanked his teammates and emphasized the team’s resilience, noting, “We went through a lot of adversity this season, but we came together, and we stuck together, and this is what we got.”\n\nWalker shouldered a heavier workload down the stretch after Seattle’s offense lost running back Zach Charbonnet to a torn ACL in the playoffs, proving his ability to lead even through tough circumstances.\n\nWalker’s MVP performance not only helped deliver a Super Bowl title but also snapped a decades-long drought for running backs winning the MVP award, underscoring both how well he played and how meaningful the achievement was for his position.\n\nThe post Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker III Recalls Seahawks’ Adversities After Winning What Saquon Barkley Couldn’t Last Year appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "K League sides in continental competition will take to the field for their first competitive matches of 2026 in midweek, looking to shake off any rust and continue their pursuits of 2025-2026 AFC Champions League glory.\n\nVissel Kobe (1st, JPN) vs. FC Seoul (5th) - 19:00 KST\n\nFC Seoul will play their first competitive match of 2026 away to AFC Champions League Elite leaders Vissel Kobe, as the continent's premier club competition resumes for Match Day 7. Seoul had been in decent form before the winter break, earning five points from their last three ACLE outings, the last being a 1-1 draw with Melbourne City. Vissel Kobe, meanwhile, were able to preserve their place in first with a 2-2 draw at home to Chengdu Rongcheng, making it three unbeaten following wins over Ulsan and Shanghai Shenhua. Kobe got their domestic campaign up and running on Friday in the J1 100 Year Vision League, away to Kyoto Sanga, drawing 1-1 then winning 4-1 on penalties.\n\nKobe's clash with Ulsan was one of two against K League opposition in the 2025-2026 edition of the competition, the other being a thrilling 4-3 loss away to Gangwon. Seoul, meanwhile, have faced J.League opposition just once so far this campaign, earning a 1-1 draw away to Machida Zelvia last September. Kobe will be a tough nut to crack for Seoul, with the J1 League champions leading the way for clean sheets with four and having shown their attacking prowess with the second-most touches in the box and the best shot conversion rate in the competition of 18.8%. Seoul, meanwhile, rank first for accurate passes per match, so will be expected to have lots of possession of the ball, despite being the away side, and rank fourth for big chances created.\n\nSeoul will have to be wary of Yoshinori Muto, Kobe's goal scorer on Friday, who ranks second for shots on target per 90 with 2.7, ranks first for successful dribbles (75%), and has two goals and one assist to his name in the ACL. The capital club will be looking to new recruit Song Min-kyu to fill Jesse Lingard's shoes. Song has featured in AFC club competitions 18 times, scoring five and assisting one.\n\nGangwon FC (9th) vs. Shanghai Port (12th, CHN) - 19:00 KST\n\nGangwon FC got off to a great start in their debut ACL season, but form tailed off towards the end of 2025, and now the Bears sit outside the qualification group. Jeong Kyung-ho's men are ninth, but just a point behind Johor Darul Ta'zim, Buriram United, and Ulsan, and face basement side Shanghai Port next. The Chinese Super League giants have managed to pick up just two points from their first six ACLE matches, owing to draws with Sanfrecce Hiroshima and JDT. They also lost 3-1 to FC Seoul in what is so far their only clash with a K League side this campaign.\n\nGangwon's continental bow brought a 2-1 home win over Port's city neighbours Shanghai Shenhua, but was followed up by a 1-0 loss away to Chengdu Rongcheng. Gangwon will look to control the game with the lion's share of possession, having racked up the highest so far among teams in the East side of the competition with 59.9%, but will be looking to get more shots on target, ranking ninth in that regard. Shanghai Port are the reigning Chinese Super League champions and were not among the teams deducted points for match fixing. Although unlikely, qualification to the Round of 16 is still mathematically possible, but it would take two wins from their last two games, and for results elsewhere to go their way.\n\nKim Dae-won will be Gangwon's player to watch, creating 3.1 chances per 90 on average and 13 overall as the Bears' best in that regard and the best among players in the East side of the competition. But if Gangwon can create chances, they'll need to find a way past Port goalkeeper Wei Chen, who ranks third for save percentage (81.8%) and first for saves per 90 with 6.8.\n\nUlsan HD (8th) vs. Melbourne City (4th, AUS) - 19:00 KST\n\nUlsan HD begin life under new manager Kim Hyun-seok with the visit of A-League Men side Melbourne City. They do so sitting just inside the qualification group for the Round of 16, but will need to start picking up wins if they are to reach the knockouts. The Horangi lost 3-1 away to Machida Zelvia in their last ACL outing, and are on a run of three without a win. City, meanwhile, sit fourth having put together a run of four matches unbeaten with three victories. Their most recent outing was a very credible 1-1 draw away to FC Seoul. Domestically, Melbourne City are seventh in the table following five wins, seven draws and five losses, with just two wins in their last six, however. On Saturday, City played out a 1-1 draw with Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\nUlsan rank fifth for shots on target per match with 4.8, but will need to improve their conversion rate which stands at just 7.8%. The Horangi have also found it hard to create meaningful chances, ranking seventh for big chances with 12 and just five goals scored. City have been clinical with seven goals scored from 10 big chances, but 2.5 shots on target per match might not be sustainable. If Ulsan can defend well against their A-League counterparts, they could emerge with all three points.\n\nDarijan Bojanic will be key to Ulsan again this season and indeed this Wednesday. The Swede is first for accurate passes per 90 at 68.9, while Max Caputo, despite being on the bench against Wanderers at the weekend, is City's top scorer domestically with six and has two goals in ACLE thus far. It'll be the first-ever meeting between the two teams, but Ulsan have a record of nine wins, three draws and three losses versus Australian opposition, and are unbeaten in their last nine, while City have two wins and one draw from just three meetings.\n\nPohang Steelers vs. Gamba Osaka (JPN) - 19:00\n\nIn AFC Champions League Two, Pohang Steelers host Gamba Osaka on Thursday in the first leg of their Round of 16 tie. Pohang won four of their six Group H matches, losing just one but face a Gamba Osaka side that won all six of their Group F matches, keeping four clean sheets and conceding just two goals. Gamba finished ninth in the J1 last season and managed just five away wins from 19 matches. They began the new domestic campaign with a 0-0 draw in the Osaka derby, but won 5-4 on penalties, in what turned out to be a 10 vs. 10 affair with Takeru Kishimoto sent off on 84 minutes and Hayato Tanaka for Cerezo.\n\nThursday's contest might prove to be a tight affair with both teams boasting solid defenses, conceding just two goals each so far. Pohang have racked up the most possession so far with 69.7%, while Gamba rank third in that regard with 68.6%, having both played against teams that defended in low blocks. Pohang rank third for shots on target per match with 6.5, while Gamba are the competition's best passers wth 581.2 accurate passes per match.\n\nPohang faced Gamba in the 2012 ACL group stage, earning two wins - 2-0 at home and 3-0 away. Gamba have a record of eight wins, six draws and 11 losses against K League opposition over the years, with the most recent meetings being against Jeonbuk in 2021. In Korea, Gamba's record reads three wins, three draws, and five losses.",

    "description": "Guarding Michael Jordan never felt more like a death sentence than it did for Kevin Johnson during the 1993 NBA Finals. Johnson has long stated how he feels terrible about how Charles Barkley is ringless due to that Finals.",
    "fullText": "Guarding Michael Jordan never felt more like a death sentence than it did for Kevin Johnson during the 1993 NBA Finals. Johnson has long stated how he feels terrible about how Charles Barkley is ringless due to that Finals. However, with MJ on the other end of the court, perhaps that was inevitable?\n\nThe ’93 Finals had several intersecting and interesting storylines. One was the fact that Jordannever saw Dan Majerle as a threat. Dan was propped up to be a ‘Jordan stopper’ of sorts but this didn’t move the needle for him in the slightest.\n\nGames 1 and 2 saw Jordan score a total of 73 points and the Bulls go up 2-0 with Majerle guarding ‘His Airness’. The Suns coaching staff saw this as a clear misstep and defensive deficiency. Their next course of action? Have Kevin Johnson take up the task.\n\n“I walk straight in that church and I sit in the front row. I’m like, ‘Jesus, I don’t believe in you no more,’” saidJohnson the Club520 podcast. The concept of having to defend Michael in the Finals was so unfathomable for KJ that he, at first, believed he had dreamt it.\n\nWhen he told MJ during Game 3’s jumpball that he was guarding him, the latter’s reaction was a mere “Huh?”\n\nFunnily enough, the Suns ended up winning Game 3 in triple overtime despite Jordan’s 44. Johnson was no scrub however as he held his own on the offensive end as well, going 11-24 from the field and having 25 points on the night.\n\nThe Suns won two out of their three games in Chicago but would eventually lose Game 6, leading to the Bulls winning their third straight title.\n\nKevin is still quite proud of the way he guarded Mike though, saying “Take that Mike!” on the podcast when speaking on keeping MJ below the scoring average he had when guarded by Dan.\n\nThe post Kevin Johnson Entered a Church to Pray Before Guarding Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "The Patriots came up short, losing 29-13 to the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX on Sunday. However, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte believes New England missed out on numerous opportunities throughout the game.\n\n“I said they played well, I wouldn’t discredit that,” Boutte said on Sunday after a reporter asked what made Seattle’s defense so good. “But I think as an offense we left opportunities out there too, as I said, they did everything we expected them to do, we just didn’t execute.”\n\nSeattle’s defense did an excellent job of keeping New England in check for most of the game, holding it scoreless until the fourth quarter.\n\nBoutte had a challenging night, finishing with just one catch on five targets for a total of 21 yards. A significant factor in Boutte’s struggles was quarterback Drake Maye, who also had a difficult game, turning the ball over three times — two interceptions and a fumble.\n\nNew England’s offensive line also played a significant role in the offense’s inability to move the ball, leading to Maye being sacked six times.\n\nThe Patriots struggled to find their rhythm until late in the game, but by then, they were too far behind on the scoreboard to mount a comeback.\n\nPatriots, Celtics Meet Same Fate On Super Bowl Sunday",

    "description": "Super Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at - this is how a thunderous evening in California panned out.",
    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nBad Bunny piles on Puerto Rican patriotism at Super Bowl half-time show\n\nWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "The Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-7 in Super Bowl LX. MVP Kenneth Walker III leads the record EIGHT Studs from tonight!",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks just won the Super Bowl!\n\nThey defeated the New England Patriots 29-7 in Super Bowl LX to claim their second Lombardi Trophy as a franchise. There's so much to be happy about, but none more than the blessing of watching this team this season. We have an entire offseason to break it down, but for now and for the last time this season...\n\nHere are your Studs and Duds for the Super Bowl LX!\n\nKenneth Walker III rushed for 135 yards on 27 carries (averaging 5.0 YPC) and won Super Bowl MVP. He added 26 receiving yards, too, but his biggest asset to the team was being the only offensive force that consistently instilled fear in either defense the entire night. There’s no Seahawk who saw their stock increase so dramatically this postseason – or in any ever, for that matter.\n\nDevon Witherspoon had a case for Super Bowl MVP himself. He had four tackles, a sack, a tackle for loss, and forced Uchenna Nwosu’s pick-six. His blitz usage was the difference in the game on defense, and will go down in the history books as one of the most versatile adjustments a player has ever been able to make in a game of this magnitude.\n\nDerick Hall had two sacks, two tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and two tackles. He became the matchup of the night on Patriots rookie left tackle Will Campbell and won in dramatic fashion. He woke up today viewed as a rotational player, and ended a franchise legend tonight. By matching his entire regular season sack total in the Super Bowl, he literall saved it for when it counted most.\n\nUchenna Nwosu will finally go down in Seahawks lore as his consistent force of work ought to. His 45-yard pick six capped off a massively under-appreciated season with one of the biggest defensive plays in the history of the organization. He didn’t get a single tackle, sack or tackle for loss, but it does not matter– because he played his role on this incredibly deep team by coming up in the clutch in the big moment when it was needed most.\n\nBoth Jason Myers and Michael Dickson had all-time performances in the kicking game tonight. Myers set a record for kicker points in a Super Bowl with 17, going 5/5 on field goals and 2/2 on extra points. Dickson averaged 47.9 yards per punt (335 total yards on 7 punts) and gave Seattle a field-position security blanket in the defensive battle that moved the needle more than any single-game punting performance in recent memory.\n\nAt just 38 years old, Mike Macdonald became the third youngest head coach to ever win a Super Bowl, and also the first defensive play-calling one. He refused to lift the Lombardi trophy without his players doing so at the same time as well, which sums up his selflessness as well as possible. Mike Vrabel might’ve won Coach of the Year, but if one were to power rank the NFL head coaches right now, he would undoubtedly be number one.\n\nByron Murphy II was the sleeper MVP of the night. He had two sacks, two tackles for loss, and consistently reset the line of scrimmage. He was the best lineman on either team tonight. In just his second year, there’s truly no limit to what his career trajectory can look like after becoming a Super Bowl Champion in his second year- and dominating on the biggest stage, at that.\n\nThe 12s were PHENOMENAL tonight, as they were all season long. They set the tone before kickoff and during every snap by drowning the entire stadium out with chants of “SEA… HAWKS!” Throughout the whole game. Coach Macdonald’s motto of 12 as one represents the rebirth that has taken place in the Pacific Northwest's football fanbase, who hold the most revered fan tradition in the NFL.\n\nThe Seahawks defense only allowed 23 rushing yards to Rhamondre Stevenson, meaning they finished the entire season- 20 total games- without allowing a 100-yard rusher. Their streak extends to 29 straight games dating back to last season. Truly mind-boggling… while the Patriots defense honed in on Jaxon Smith-Njigba and held him quiet, Cooper Kupp led the team with 61 receiving yards… JSN soaked up all the attention and allowed his teammates to thrive so he could get his first ring… AJ Barner scored the Seahawks only offensive touchdown, routing up another safety on a corner route to do so in a huge moment, just like the Rams game in Week 16… and as Mike Macdonald says, it's not just about the 53, but the entire 70. From the entire roster to the practice squad, everyone on the Seahawks just earned a Super Bowl Ring that they'll cherish for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe game was close for the majority, so of course, there were a few duds. Cornerbacks Josh Jobe and Tariq Woolen lost it on consecutive plays, beginning with Jobe throwing an open-hand punch at Stefon Diggs, followed immediately by Mack Hollins dominating Tariq Woolen for 24- and 35-yards plus a touchdown on two consecutive plays. There were plenty of other areas for improvement- if the Seahawks thought they were perfect, they would never have got there in the first place. However, we at Seahawks Wire will be talking about that ALL offseason, every single day- for now, it’s time to celebrate, if it ever was!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks Super Bowl LX: Studs and Duds from the championship win",

    "fullText": "Is Drake Maye the next Dan Marino or Joe Burrow? How rough Super Bowl 60 changes narrative for Patriots QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDrake Maye became the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl when he faced the Seahawks in Super Bowl 60. Unfortunately, after a 29-13 setback in which he struggled against Seattle's defense, Maye, 23, is now also the second-youngest QB to lose a Super Bowl.\n\nHall of Famer Dan Marino was also 23 when he led the Dolphins to defeat in Super Bowl 19, a 38-16 loss to Joe Montana and the 49ers. Like Maye, he was in his second season. Marino was the MVP in the 1984 regular season before the playoffs, while Maye was the MVP runner-up in 2025.\n\nWith Marino emerging as an all-time great passer quickly, it was expected he would return to the Super Bowl at least once—and maybe several times—to give Montana a natural big-game rival. Instead, Marino played 15 more seasons and never won another AFC championship with Miami.\n\nBad Bunny halftime show reviews\n\nWinners and losers from Super Bowl 60\n\nKenneth Walker ends 28-year RB MVP drought\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade details\n\nBest and worst Super Bowl commercials in 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Roethlisberger was 23 on the Steelers team that won Super Bowl 40 over the Seahawks. He went on to win a second ring in Super Bowl 44.\n\nSo the question is: Does the loss to the Seahawks set up Maye for another “tough no-ring” scenario, or can the Patriots count on returning to the Super Bowl with him at quarterback?\n\nIt’s hard to say now, but let’s consider the other second-year QBs who joined Maye, Marino, and Roethlisberger in starting a Super Bowl.\n\nKurt Warner was the first to win, with the 1999 Rams in Super Bowl 34. Then came Tom Brady, whose Patriots upset Warner’s Rams two years later in Super Bowl 36. The other second-year winner was Russell Wilson, who led the 2013 Seahawks to victory in Super Bowl 48.\n\nUnfortunately, Maye now joins Marino, Colin Kaepernick, Joe Burrow, and Brock Purdy-- fellow second-year QBs who lost their first Super Bowl trips. Excluding the two 49ers, who lost close games, Maye most closely resembles Marino and Burrow.\n\nBurrow’s Bengals lost Super Bowl 56 to the Rams, 23-20, and were hammered by the defense. He faced Aaron Donald and the Rams’ pass rush, which tied a Super Bowl record with seven sacks -- Donald and Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller had two each.\n\nMaye was sacked six times by the Seahawks. He also threw a pick-six as part of two interceptions and lost a fumble under pressure. Likewise, Marino was sacked four times by the 49ers and threw two interceptions.\n\nMORE: Why Drake Maye's legacy won't be defined by Super Bowl 60 flop\n\nBurrow is still active, giving him a chance for a Super Bowl return. But repeated punishment and a combination of offensive line and defensive shortcomings have limited his championship prospects.\n\nThe Patriots, on paper, appear poised to remain long-term AFC contenders with Maye at QB and Mike Vrabel as head coach. But nothing is guaranteed in the NFL—New England should know this after going from 3-14 to 14-3 in just one year. Fortune can be fleeting.\n\nMaye will enter his third season on his rookie deal, meaning the clock is ticking before the No. 3 overall pick of 2024 earns a lucrative long-term extension—a second contract that could restrict signing and retaining free agents while staying under the salary cap. Burrow’s extension handcuffed the Bengals’ ability to surround him with talent, particularly at wide receiver.\n\nMarino signed an extension in 1986, three years after being drafted and less than two years after losing the Super Bowl. The Dolphins made him the league’s highest-paid player both times, limiting spending elsewhere.\n\nGoing into Super Bowl 60, there was talk of Maye channeling a second-year Brady and launching another Patriots dynasty with Vrabel coaching instead of Belichick. Now, Maye’s brutal loss casts doubt on that plan, given his struggles against tougher defenses leading up to the Seahawks.\n\nMORE: Was Drake Maye's effort against Seattle one of the worst QB performances in Super Bowl history?\n\nMaye also had the chance to emerge as the AFC’s consistent challenger to Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, potentially winning a Super Bowl before Burrow, Josh Allen, or Lamar Jackson. This past season was unusual, with Mahomes and Jackson absent from the playoffs. Concerns remain that Maye’s strong stats came against a favorable schedule, and he may regress in Year 3.\n\nIn 2021, before Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl, he led the league in completion percentage (70.4) and yards per pass attempt (8.9), but was sacked a league-high 51 times. In 2025, Maye also led the league in completion percentage (72.0) and yards per attempt (8.9) and was sacked 47 times -- foreshadowing the 21 sacks he endured in just four playoff games through Super Bowl 60.\n\nNew England likely will improve pass protection, but Maye’s tendency to extend plays with his athleticism may always lead to a high sack rate.=\n\nWarner, Brady, Wilson, and Roethlisberger were unflappable in their first Super Bowls as second-year QBs. Maye did not show that same composure, even compared with Burrow and Marino.\n\nThe Super Bowl and preceding playoffs are a different beast than the regular season. Ask Allen and Jackson -- two recent non-Mahomes MVPs—who failed to reach the Super Bowl despite Hall of Fame credentials. Four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers is running out of time to earn a second ring. Cam Newton, Matt Ryan, and Matthew Stafford had their chances once -- and that was it.\n\nMORE: Drake Maye gets emotional following Super Bowl 60 loss\n\nWinning a Super Bowl as a top passer is difficult, which makes one appreciate Brady, Mahomes, and Montana all the more for executing in clutch playoff moments.\n\nThe 23-year-old Maye has time on his side -- but so did Marino, and so did Burrow, who four years later is still chasing his first ring.\n\nThis is a great QB era. The AFC is loaded with elite passers and high-potential stars. Unfortunately, history suggests Maye is more likely to follow the path of Marino or Burrow than become the next Brady or Mahomes.",

    "fullText": "Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shared his “disappointed” reaction after a heartbreaking Super Bowl loss. The New England Patriots battled it out on the field against the Seattle Seahawks on February 8. Notably, the Seahawks defeated the Patriots 29–13. Unsurprisingly, Patriots coach Vrabel isn’t pleased with his team’s performance on the field.\n\nPatriots coach Mike Vrabel is understandably “disappointed” after the Super Bowl loss. Notably, Vrabel took over an underperforming team and led them to a remarkable 14‑3 regular-season record before winning three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nFans who watched the game would acknowledge that the Patriots did not deliver their best against the Seahawks. Vrabel, without mincing any words, stated, “Disappointed. I reminded them that we’re 307 days into what hopefully is a long, successful relationship and program” (via Patriots. com).\n\nContinuing further, he shared, “It’s OK to be disappointed. We have to be disappointed and upset together. . . . Every year, somebody’s going to lose this game. We have to remember what it feels like and make sure it’s not repeatable.”\n\nPatriots’ long-term fans believe the team wasn’t up to the mark in yesterday’s game and barely performed to their potential. However, coach Vrabel is proud of the team’s efforts and believes their performance in yesterday’s match was not an accurate “reflection of our year.” Vrabel also added that making this kind of jump in their first year together “wasn’t very valuable.”\n\nMoreover, the 50-year-old believes the heartbreaking loss is the entire team’s responsibility, and the onus isn’t on any single player.\n\nVrabel remarked, “We can sit here and try to put it all on one guy. You’ll be disappointed cause that’ll never happen. It starts with us as the coaching staff, making sure that we’re doing our part. Obviously, we have to be able to execute. We’ve gotta be able to protect, and when we do protect, we have to be able to progress through and throw to guys open and help the quarterback, and then he’s gotta be better. That’s just how it goes.”\n\nThe post Patriots’ Coach Mike Vrabel ‘Disappointed’ After Super Bowl Loss appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks produced a devastating defensive display to beat the New England Patriots and claim their second Super Bowl victory.\n\nTwo of the NFL's strongest defences battled it out in Sunday's showpiece and the Seahawks emphatically came out on top to win 29-13 at Levi's Stadium in.\n\nIt was a defensive performance for the ages and Briton Aden Durde played a pivotal role, becoming the first overseas coach to win the Unites States' biggest game.\n\nSeattle's 46-year-old defensive co-ordinator has helped create the most feared defence in the NFL, which has become known as 'the Dark Side', and they showed why on American football's biggest stage in Santa Clara, California.\n\nNew England's second-year quarterback Drake Maye narrowly missed out on this season's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award but was stifled by the Seahawks, who claimed six sacks, forced three turnovers and scored a defensive touchdown.\n\nAfter Seattle led 9-0 at half-time, Maye's first turnover resulted in the game's opening touchdown for tight end AJ Barner early in the fourth quarter.\n\nLinebacker Uchenna Nwosu then returned an interception for a 45-yard touchdown, while Jason Meyers kicked a record five field goals as Seattle denied the Patriots a record seventh Super Bowl win.\n\n\"We were the better team; we're the best team. We loved each other, we believed in each other and now we're champions,\" Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald told NBC.\n\n\"We went to the dark side tonight. We love our players - they made it happen. They made it come to life.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nMost of the 70,823 crowd seemed to favour Seattle, who came into the game as narrow favourites, and their win also means quarterback Sam Darnold completed his redemption story after being written off as a starting NFL quarterback.\n\nThe Seahawks are Darnold's fifth team in his eight-year career - and third in three years - but in his first year in Seattle the former third overall draft pick has won the game's biggest prize.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been haunted by a comment he made as he struggled in a game against the Patriots in 2019, when he said \"I'm seeing ghosts\", but Darnold has now exorcised those demons.\n\nInstead, it was Maye who suffered a nightmare when confronted with the fast, physical defence that Durde and coach Macdonald have fashioned in their two seasons together in Seattle.\n\nSuch is the breadth and depth of the threat it carries that Devon Witherspoon claimed a sack from cornerback. He, Derick Hall and Rylie Mills only registered 2.5 sacks between them all season but all three got to Maye in the first half.\n\nThe Patriots earned only four first downs before the interval and 52 yards in total. Some cruel folks on social media even joked that Bad Bunny gained more yards as he carried a ball during his half-time show.\n\nHall's second sack forced a fumble which was recovered by Byron Murphy, who also sacked Maye twice as the Dark Side wrote themselves into Seattle folklore alongside the 'Legion of Boom', the defence that led the Seahawks to their previous Super Bowl win in 2014.\n\n\"My team-mates and my coaches, they believed in me,\" Darnold told NBC.\n\n\"Since the first training camp, every single day we came to work. Shout-out to our offensive line for everything they did in the game. But I've also got to shout out our defence.\n\n\"We did it. It's been such a special journey with these guys. So much hard work has been out into this and we did it.\"\n\nNew England were playing in their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick.\n\nThe duo led the Patriots to six Super Bowl wins, tying the NFL record with the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Mike Vrabel playing in three of those wins.\n\nAfter two 4-13 seasons, the former linebacker returned to New England as head coach and has rebuilt the roster, leading the Patriots to a record-extending 12th Super Bowl appearance.\n\nVrabel was hoping to become the first man to win a Super Bowl as a player and head coach with the same franchise, while Maye aimed to be the youngest quarterback to win the big game.\n\nAs well as having the league's best pass completion rate this season, Maye has impressed with his ability to scramble and escape the pressure.\n\nThere was no getting away from the Seahawks, though, as New England were unable to get their run game going or get star receiver Stefon Diggs into the game.\n\nMaye did give the Patriots hope as he found Mack Hollins for a touchdown to cut the score to 19-7, but he was intercepted on their next two possessions, meaning Rhamondre Stevenson's late score was a consolation.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nStu Lantz, a 6-foot-3 guard, starred at the University of Nebraska before being taken in the 1968 NBA Draft by the San Diego Rockets. His best season came during the 1970-71 campaign, when he averaged 20.6 points, five rebounds and 4.2 assists a game.\n\nHe was traded to the Lakers during the 1974-75 season and stayed with them through the following season, which was his last in the NBA. He retired with career averages of 12.4 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists a game, including averages of 7.1 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 20.9 minutes per game with Los Angeles.\n\nLantz, of course, is best known as the Lakers' longtime television color commentator. He started in that role in the fall of 1987 and worked alongside legendary play-by-play man Chick Hearn until Hearn's death in 2002. Today, Lantz works alongside Bill Macdonald, who has been the Lakers' television play-by-play man since the 2011-12 campaign.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 23 — Stu Lantz",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s summer rebuild is already taking shape and, as reported by The Telegraph, Sandro Tonali has surged high on the club’s shortlist to replace Casemiro. It is a signal of intent from Old Trafford, a move that would blend long term planning with immediate competitive ambition.\n\nUnited’s need is obvious. Casemiro’s confirmed summer departure removes not only experience but also tactical security from the engine room. For a side still searching for rhythm, control, and authority in central areas, recruitment here will define the next phase of the project.\n\nTonali, 25, represents both pedigree and Premier League adaptation, a rare combination in a volatile market.\n\nUnited’s interest in Tonali sits within a broader scouting framework. Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are also under consideration, while previous inquiries into Brighton’s Carlos Baleba underline the club’s desire for athletic, progressive midfielders.\n\nYet Tonali’s profile stands apart.\n\nThree seasons in England have hardened his tactical awareness. Newcastle’s £55m investment in 2023 now looks modest in an era where Enzo Fernández, Moisés Caicedo and Declan Rice all commanded fees beyond £100m. Newcastle would expect similar territory for Tonali, particularly given his contract running to 2029.\n\nThere is risk attached, notably his betting ban earlier in his Premier League spell, but United appear focused on the footballer rather than the controversy.\n\nTransfer narratives rarely ignite without agent intervention and Giuseppe Riso’s remarks have ensured this story gathers pace.\n\n“Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,” Riso said.\n\nHe added, “We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We’ll see how the season ends and then we’ll decide what to do.”\n\nPerhaps most telling was the ambiguity, “There’s no preference. It’s still early. What we’re saying today won’t apply tomorrow.”\n\nSuch language keeps every elite suitor engaged, Juventus, Manchester City, Arsenal, and now United most prominently.\n\nEuropean qualification may ultimately shape Tonali’s future. Newcastle sit 12th in the Premier League and face Qarabag in a Champions League play off, their route back to the competition remains uncertain.\n\nRiso acknowledged the emotional tie, stating, “Newcastle couldn’t let him go now, and there’s no point moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.”\n\nAttachment, though, often bends under competitive gravity. Tonali wants Champions League football. United believe they can offer it, or at least return to it swiftly.\n\nFrom a strategic lens, this pursuit feels calculated. Tonali is entering his peak years, already Premier League tested, tactically disciplined, and technically secure under pressure. He would not merely replace Casemiro, he would recalibrate United’s midfield identity.\n\nFrom a Manchester United supporter’s perspective, this report lands somewhere between excitement and caution.\n\nTonali is undeniably elite. His tempo control, positional intelligence, and ability to dictate transitions would address long standing midfield imbalances. United have too often lacked composure in high leverage matches, particularly against top six rivals. Tonali would change that dynamic.\n\nYet £100m territory demands scrutiny. Fans will remember recent midfield spending sprees across the league and question value versus urgency. Is Tonali transformative, or simply premium stabilisation.\n\nThere is also squad context. When Casemiro departs, United require not one midfielder but two, possibly three, depending on outgoings. Investing heavily in a single profile could restrict broader rebuild flexibility.\n\nStill, the upside is compelling. Tonali offers leadership without theatrics, control without slowing play, and durability in England’s most demanding fixtures.\n\nIf United are serious about restoring midfield authority, this is the calibre required. The question is not quality, it is whether the club can align finance, Champions League qualification, and long term squad architecture around one decisive signing.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool will soon need to replace their club legend and a 21-year-old super talent could do it.\n\nIt's a time of metamorphosis at Anfield. Liverpool are in the middle of replacing the old icons who helped the club reach its pinnacle and bring in new stars who can take the baton from them and continue the success.\n\nWe've already seen the likes of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Trent Alexander-Arnold depart.\n\nBut their exodus was just the beginning. Mo Salah is likely going to depart in the summer and he will be followed shortly by Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker.\n\nEveryone is focusing on replacements for Van Dijk and Salah at the moment, so Alisson has gone under the radar.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nSure, Liverpool have Giorgi Mamardashvili who seems like an ideal successor. However, Liverpool may need more depth than that.\n\nMamardashvili is a competent back-up but can he be trusted to be the no.1? Or perhaps Liverpool should have two no.1s instead competing for the same spot?\n\nAfter Alisson's departure, the latter makes the most sense. Mamardashvili is still young for a goalkeeper and he may benefit from added competition and working alongside someone who is just as eager and hungry to oust him from the no.1 spot.\n\nRight now, Alisson's contract expires in the summer of 2026. The club has an option to extend the deal until 2027, and they likely will.\n\nSo, we don't have to worry about replacing the Brazilian just yet. Unless, Liverpool decide to surprise us all and let Alisson either leave on a free or for a fee if they extend his contract.\n\nThere have been times when it felt like Alisson has been open to returning to Brazil so it is something to keep an eye on.\n\nFortunately, Liverpool are well-placed to find his successor. The club has an excellent track-record with goalkeepers and right now there is an outstanding young super talent in Europe's top five leagues who seems like he could be the perfect successor to Alisson's throne.\n\nLet us introduce you to RC Lens' 21-year-old goalkeeper Robin Risser. The France U21 international has been ever-present in a side going toe to toe with Paris Saint Germain in Ligue 1 this season.\n\nHe's played a key role in Lens' success.\n\nCurrently, Risser has prevented 4.56 goals in Ligue 1, which is the second highest among goalkeepers in the competition in the current campaign.\n\nHe also has a save rate of 77%, which is the third highest among goalkeepers.\n\nRisser does exactly what you ask from a goalkeeper. He prevents goals and makes important stops. But there's more to him than that.\n\nHe is very similar to Alisson in terms of his ability to come off his line. Risser is fast and he's very good in one vs one situations, meaning even when his defence exposes him, he can prevent the opposition from scoring.\n\nAt 21-years-old, he's still extremely young for a goalkeeper, but he is absolutely one of the brightest talents out there in European football at the moment.\n\nRisser's ability to come out and smother opposition attackers makes him the ideal and inevitable Alisson heir.\n\nIt won't be easy for anyone to live up to the Brazilian's reputation. Alisson is a club legend for everything that he achieved at Anfield. However, if anyone can do it, it's Risser.\n\nKeep an eye out on this potential move.",

    "title": "Beyond VDI: The rise of the 1:1 remote workstation",
    "description": "From compact ‘desktops’ to purpose-built blades, welcome to a new wave of dedicated 1:1 datacentre-ready workstations",
    "fullText": "For more than a decade, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and cloud workstations have promised flexible, centrally managed workstation resources for design and engineering teams that use CAD, BIM and other 3D software. But a parallel trend is now gathering serious momentum: the rise of the 1:1 remote workstation.\n\nIn a 1:1 model, each user gets remote access to a dedicated physical workstation with its own CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no resource sharing, no slicing of processors, and no contention with other users.\n\nIn many ways, it combines the performance predictability of a local desktop workstation with many of the management, security and centralised data benefits traditionally associated with VDI.\n\nThis shift is being driven by performance demands, changing IT priorities, and the growing maturity of remote access technologies. And it is appearing in several distinct forms. What is a 1:1 remote workstation?\n\nUnlike VDI or public cloud environments like AWS or Microsoft Azure, where multiple users typically share CPUs and GPUs through virtualisation, a 1:1 remote workstation assigns an entire machine to a single user. That machine typically sits in racks in a dedicated server room or datacentre, either on-premise or hosted by a third-party service provider. However, it could also sit under a desk, or in the corner of an office.\n\nThe user accesses the workstation remotely using high-performance display protocols such as Mechdyne TGX, PCoIP (HP Anyware), NICE DCV (now Amazon DCV), Parsec or Citrix HDX. However, from a compute perspective, it behaves exactly like a local workstation.\n\nOne of the most visible indicators of the 1:1 trend, especially for design and engineering teams that use CAD and BIM software, is the relocation of compact desktop workstations into the datacentre.\n\nMachines such as the HP Z2 Mini and Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF are increasingly being mounted in racks rather than sitting on desks. Thanks to their small form factors, these systems offer impressive density. With the ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, for example, seven individual workstations can be housed in a 5U chassis.\n\nDensity matters for several reasons. Higher density reduces rack space requirements, lowers hosting costs, and improves energy efficiency per user.\n\nCrucially, these are still true desktop workstations. Users get the same CPU frequencies, GPU options and application performance they would expect from a machine under their desk. Remote management and access capabilities are typically added via specialist add-in cards, enabling IT teams to control and maintain systems centrally.\n\nCompact desktop workstations do have their limitations. While they can offer the highest-frequency CPUs — capable of boosting into Turbo for excellent performance in single-threaded CAD and BIM applications such as Solidworks and Autodesk Revit — they are typically restricted to low-profile GPUs or integrated graphics.\n\nIn the past, this confined them largely to traditional CAD and BIM workflows. However, the latest compact models are surprisingly capable, with models including the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada and Nvidia RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell SFF, having enough graphics horsepower and GPU memory to comfortably handle mainstream visualisation workflows in applications such as Enscape, Twinmotion, KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize.\n\nWhile GPU sharing is rarely a major issue for day-to-day CAD and BIM work, it becomes critical for visualisation and rendering workflows, where the GPU may be driven at 100% utilisation for extended periods\n\nFor more demanding users, high-end desktop tower workstations with high core count CPUs, lots of memory, and one or more exceedingly powerful full height professional GPUs, can also be racked, extending the adapted desktop model to advanced visualisation, simulation and AI workflows. However, achievable density is massively reduced.\n\nThe major workstation players – Dell, HP and Lenovo – design most of their tower systems to be rack mountable, as does Boxx. However, that’s not the case for all systems, especially custom manufacturers that often use consumer gaming chassis.\n\nAnother strand of the trend is the resurgence of the purpose-built workstation blade, a form factor first pioneered by HP in the early 2000s. Each blade is a slender, self-contained 1:1 workstation with its own CPU, GPU, memory, and storage, engineered specifically for deployment in the datacentre.\n\nIn 2025, new systems have arrived from Amulet Hotkey, while Computle has gone one step further, launching a workstation-as-a-service offering built around its own dedicated blade hardware. Established players such as Boxx and ClearCube also continue to offer blade-based workstation platforms.\n\nBlades provide a clean, highly modular approach to workstation deployment. The density is impressive with typically around 10 blades slotting into 5U or 6U chassis. Blades also integrate neatly into existing datacentre infrastructure, relying on centralised and redundant power, which simplifies cabling and makes them inherently well suited to remote-access scenarios.\n\nFrom a performance perspective, blades are ideal for CAD and BIM workflows, commonly featuring high frequency CPUs and single slot pro GPUs. However, some blades can also support full height, dual slot GPUs, which can push graphics performance into the realms of high-end visualisation, beyond that of the compact desktop workstation.\n\nFor organisations standardising on remote-first workflows, blades represent a highly engineered interpretation of the 1:1 workstation concept.\n\nSitting alongside blades are 1U, 2U, and 4U rack-mounted workstations, purpose-built, single-user workstations designed specifically for racks. The ultra-slim 1U systems are sometimes called “pizza boxes”.\n\nRack workstations appeal to organisations seeking maximum performance, full-size professional GPUs, and good integration with existing server infrastructure — without the need for a blade chassis. Like other 1:1 approaches, they deliver predictable, dedicated performance while avoiding the complexity of heavy virtualisation.\n\nThe downside of rack workstations is their low density—particularly for CAD and BIM workflows, where the most suitable graphics cards are often small, entry-level models, leaving much of the large internal space unused.\n\nThere’s a tonne of firms that offer dedicated rack workstations, including PC Specialists, Armari, Novatech, G2 Digital, Exxact, Titan, ACnodes, BOXX, Puget Systems, and Supermicro. HP and Dell also have rack systems but these are now several years old and, presumably, being phased out in favour of small form factor workstations.\n\nThe strongest argument for 1:1 remote workstations is performance.\n\nEach user gets dedicated CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no noisy neighbour effect, no unexpected slowdowns because another user happens to be rendering or running a simulation.\n\nCPUs are typically Intel Core processors, which deliver very high clock frequencies and aggressive Turbo behaviour. This is especially important for CAD and BIM applications, which often rely on single-threaded or lightly threaded performance.\n\nIn contrast, VDI and cloud workstations rely on virtualised CPUs, where users receive a fraction of a processor. These virtualised environments often use server-class CPUs such as Intel Xeon or AMD Epyc, which prioritise core count over frequency. Even specialist CAD-focused VDI platforms based on AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro involve CPU virtualisation and typically do not allow the processor to go into Turbo.\n\nAnd frequency really matters for performance. Even simple tasks, such as opening a model or “syncing to central”, are significantly impacted by low CPU frequency. When working with huge models, this can create a major bottleneck, potentially taking hours of out of the working week.\n\nOn the GPU side, 1:1 systems avoid contention entirely. While GPU sharing is rarely a major issue for day-to-day CAD and BIM work, it becomes critical for visualisation and rendering workflows, where the GPU may be driven at 100% utilisation for extended periods. A dedicated GPU ensures consistent, predictable performance.\n\nThe strongest argument for 1:1 remote workstations is performance. Each user gets dedicated CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no noisy neighbour effect, no unexpected slowdowns because another user happens to be rendering or running a simulation\n\nThere’s also the matter of GPU memory to consider. A typical entry-level pro GPU for design viz, such as the Nvidia RTX 2000 Pro Blackwell, comes with 20 GB of memory. To get this amount in a VDI setup would be very expensive. And if you don’t have enough GPU memory to load or render a scene, performance can drop dramatically, or software can even crash.\n\nAs with VDI, organisations can choose where and how their 1:1 workstations are hosted.\n\nSome firms deploy systems on-premise, purchasing hardware from vendors such as HP, Lenovo, Amulet Hotkey, ClearCube and Boxx. Lenovo, in particular, is working to simplify deployment through its Lenovo Access Blueprints, which provide reference architectures and guidance.\n\nOthers opt for fully managed services, hosting dedicated workstations in third-party datacentres. Providers such as IMSCAD, Computle and Creative ITC deliver managed 1:1 workstation platforms, combining dedicated hardware with subscription-based services.\n\nInterestingly, neither HP nor Lenovo has gone so far as to offer their own workstation-as-a-service platforms directly. Instead, they prefer to work through specialist partners, allowing customers to choose between ownership and service-based consumption models.\n\nVDI’s greatest strength has always been flexibility: the ability to resize virtual machines and dynamically allocate CPU, GPU and memory resources.\n\nA 1:1 workstation is inherently more fixed. You cannot simply dial up more cores or memory on demand. However, organisations can still achieve flexibility by deploying a mixed portfolio of workstation configurations tailored to different user profiles.\n\nMany firms are also adopting hybrid strategies, combining VDI for lighter or more variable workloads with 1:1 remote workstations for power users who demand guaranteed performance.\n\nNot all solutions fit neatly into either camp. Service providers like Inevidesk occupy a middle ground: its vdesk solution virtualises a Threadripper Pro CPU shared among seven users, but each user receives a dedicated GPU.\n\nThis approach sacrifices some CPU predictability and frequency but ensures consistent GPU performance, making it attractive for demanding visualisation tools where GPU contention is the primary concern.\n\nInevidesk’s approach also offers good flexibility, with the option to quickly reallocate CPU and memory resources to different VMs or pool GPU resources at night for compute intensive workflows such as rendering or AI training.\n\nEnergy efficiency is often promoted as a key advantage of VDI, with vendors claiming it has a smaller carbon footprint than maintaining multiple 1:1 workstations. The logic is straightforward: instead of powering and cooling multiple processors, graphics cards, and power supplies, a single shared infrastructure can support many users.\n\nIf reducing energy consumption is a priority, it pays to examine the details. Some past carbon comparisons we’ve seen don’t hold up under closer scrutiny, based on maximum power draw rather than typical usage. However, a recent report commissioned by Inevidesk comparing its vdesk platform to a hosted 1:1 desktop workstation, takes a more measured approach and demonstrates tangible energy savings in practice.\n\nThat said, 1:1 workstation vendors are also taking energy consumption seriously. Amulet Hotkey, for example, offers lower energy laptop processors, HP has machines with the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro processor with integrated graphics, and Computle is exploring ways to reduce energy use in its blade systems.\n\n1:1 workstations can also offer cost savings, but there are several factors to consider. On the hardware side, multiple entry-level GPUs — such as the Nvidia RTX A1000 — are often less expensive than a single high-end datacentre GPU used for VDI, like the Nvidia L40, though this depends on how many virtual machines you intend to support. This principle extends to more powerful GPUs as well: some vendors, such as Computle, provide gaming-focused GeForce GPUs instead of the more costly, passively cooled datacentre variants. On the other hand, 1:1 workstations require more individual components, including multiple motherboards, power supplies, fans, and in the case of adapted desktops, aesthetically-pleasing chassis that never see the light of day.\n\nThe software stack for 1:1 workstations is also more simple. There is no need for virtualisation software, and GPU licensing is straightforward. For example, slicing a GPU for VDI requires an Nvidia RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) software license, whereas standard free Nvidia RTX drivers are sufficient for a 1:1 workstation.\n\nThere are many compelling reasons why design and engineering firms may favour 1:1 workstations over VDI, with performance chief among them. Time and again, we’ve heard of VDI proof-of-concept projects that fail due to user pushback, particularly when performance falls short of what designers and engineers expect from a CAD workstation. In some organisations, this has become a hard line: firms such as HOK, for example, have stated they will not consider cloud workstations / virtualised server CPUs because of the performance penalties associated with single-threaded workflows.\n\nThat’s not to say VDI doesn’t have its place. Its strengths lie in flexibility, centralised management, and, in the case of public cloud offerings, global availability at scale. But for organisations where performance, user satisfaction, and workflow continuity are paramount, 1:1 remote workstations remain a highly compelling choice for those making the move from desktop to datacentre.\n\nHP’s 1:1 remote workstation spotlight falls on the HP Z2 Mini, a tiny powerhouse that comes in two flavours.\n\nThe HP Z2 Mini G1i packs high frequency Intel Core Ultra CPUs with discrete Nvidia GPUs up to the powerful RTX 4000 SFF, while the HP Z2 Mini G1a runs on the AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro processor with integrated Radeon graphics (see review here). Thanks to its smaller processor package and integrated PSU, the G1a offers a slight advantage in terms of rack density, fitting five units in 4U, compared with six G1i units in 5U.\n\nLenovo’s 1:1 workstation offering centres on the ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, a compact system with a BMC card for ‘server-grade’ remote management (see review).\n\nConfigurable with Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPUs and Nvidia RTX GPUs up to the RTX 4000 SFF, it packs a punch for CAD and viz workflows while delivering good density with up to seven units in a 5U rack space. For even higher density, the ThinkStation P3 Tiny delivers twelve systems in 5U. However, the micro workstation is limited to CAD and BIM workflows, with a narrow range of GPUs up to the Nvidia RTX A1000.\n\nCompared with HP and Lenovo, Dell is much less vocal about its 1:1 remote workstation offering, which centres on the Dell Pro Max Micro desktop, which packs seven units into a 5U rack.\n\nUnlike the HP Z2 Mini G1i and Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, which can be configured with 125W Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPUs, the Dell Pro Max Micro is limited to the 65W Intel Core Ultra 9 285. However, this is unlikely to impact performance in single-threaded CAD and BIM workflows. GPU options include the Nvidia RTX A1000 for CAD and the RTX 4000 SFF Ada for visualisation workloads.\n\nAmulet Hotkey’s CoreStation HX is built for the datacentre combining redundant power and cooling with ‘full remote system management’ via a 5U enclosure that can accommodate up to 12 workstation nodes.\n\nThe CoreStation HX2000 is built around laptop processors, up to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H and MXM GPUs up to the CAD-focused Nvidia RTX 2000 Ada.\n\nFor more demanding workflows, the upcoming CoreStation HX3000 will feature desktop processors up to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, paired with low-profile Nvidia RTX and Intel Arc Pro GPUs.\n\nComputle is a workstation-as-a-service offering powered by its own 1:1 custom blade workstations, which are purpose-built for the datacentre.\n\nCustomers can choose from four standard configurations centred on the Intel Core i7- 14700, with GPU options up to the Nvidia ‘Blackwell’ RTX 5090. For more flexibility, components can be mixed and matched, including the Intel Core i9-14900, AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, or Threadripper Pro processors. Professional GPU options include the CAD-focused Nvidia RTX A2000 and high-end RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96 GB).\n\nClearCube stands out for its extremely broad portfolio of 1:1 workstations that are purpose built for the datacentre.\n\nAt the heart of its range is the CAD Pro, a rack-dense system that fits ten blades in a 6U chassis. The CAD Pro can be configured with a choice of Intel Core CPUs and single-slot Nvidia GPUs, up to the viz-capable RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell, which is more powerful than the SFF variant found in compact 1:1 desktops. For higher end workloads, the CAD Elite line offers dedicated 1U and 2U rack workstations with GPUs up to the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Max-Q.\n\nBoxx Flexx is a datacentre– ready 1:1 workstation system, that can support up to ten 1G modules or five 2G modules (or all configurations in between) in a standard 5U rack enclosure.\n\nBoxx Flexx offers an enviable combination of density and performance, with the 1G modules offering liquid-cooled Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPUs and one double-width Nvidia GPU, while the 2G modules support two double-width GPUs.\n\nBoxx also offers BoxxCloud, a workstation-as-a-service solution where Flexx workstations are hosted in regional datacentres.\n\nInevidesk offers a VDI solution that has some characteristics of a 1:1 remote workstation. Each rack-mounted server or ‘pod’ can host up to seven GPUaccelerated virtual desktops called vdesks.\n\nThe Threadripper Pro CPU and memory is virtualised, but each vdesk gets a dedicated GPU, such as the Nvidia RTX 4000 Ada, for predictable graphics performance. Virtual processors and memory can be adjusted, while multiple GPUs can be assigned to a single vdesk to boost performance in GPU rendering or AI workflows.",

    "description": "Opinion: After decades in the trenches, this engineer is done with hype cycles",
    "fullText": "Opinion The real opponent of digital sovereignty is \"enterprise IT\" marketing, according to one Red Hat engineer who ranted entertainingly about the repeated waves of bullshit the industry hype cycle emits.\n\nDuring a coffee break at this year's CentOS Connect conference, The Reg FOSS desk paused for a chat with a developer who was surprised but happy to find us there. We won't name them – we're sure that they'd prefer to keep their job rather than enjoy a moment of fame – but we much enjoyed their pithy summary of how IT has faced repeated waves of corporate bullshit for at least 15 years now, and how they keenly and enthusiastically anticipate a large-scale financial collapse bursting the AI bubble.\n\nThis vulture has been working in the tech field for some 38 years now, and the Linux developer we spoke with has been in the business nearly as long. We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we've had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.\n\nThey called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:\n\nAdding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…\n\nContainers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren't a deployment method. You shouldn't need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you're not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren't competent enough to deploy a container either.\n\nKubernetes: If you don't need containers, then you don't need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won't happen, so you won't lose any of that imaginary business.\n\n(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)\n\nThe cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company's important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.\n\n(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There's Just Somebody Else's Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)\n\nAnything \"as a service\" – it doesn't matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don't even get servers, just OS instances. That's even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don't even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it's running; you don't get software, and you don't even know what data you have or how it's stored – you're paying for access to your own stuff.\n\n(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch's Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)\n\nThe blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world's slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they're longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.\n\nWhich brings us round to \"generative AI\" or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can't be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn't. It's predictive text turned up to 11. It can't even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:\n\nThe \"i\" in \"LLM\" stands for intelligence.\n\n(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)\n\nHonestly, we can't fault any of this reasoning. We've looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it's not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it \"relatively new,\" it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google's Gmail in 2004.\n\nCloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.\n\nWhoever \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn't come to The Reg's attention until 2011.\n\n2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.\n\nKubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running \"Borg\" internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.\n\nSo in chronological order, those are:\n\n2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS\n\n2004: SaaS reaches the general public\n\n2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD's Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme\n\n2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world\n\n2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff\n\nAll right, yes, rather more than 15 years. \"A century of tech BS\" seems a bit over the top when it's only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.\n\nObviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers' religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®",

    "title": "Russian officials are warning Putin that a financial crisis could arrive this summer, report says, while his war on Ukraine becomes too big to fail",
    "description": "\"Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail.\"",
    "fullText": "The Kremlin’s financial situation is becoming increasingly dire and could come to a head in a matter of months as oil revenue shrinks while President Vladimir Putin shows no intention of ending his war on Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials have been warning Putin with growing alarm that a financial crisis could hit by the summer, sources told the Washington Post. They pointed to weak oil revenue, which crashed by 50% in January from a year earlier, and a budget deficit that continues to widen, even after Putin hiked taxes on consumers.\n\nA Moscow business executive also told the Post that the crisis could arrive in “three or four months” amid spiraling inflation, adding that restaurants have been closing and thousands of workers are getting laid off.\n\nThe economic strains go back to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago. As sanctions took hold and Putin mobilized the economy for a prolonged war, a tight labor market and high inflation forced the central bank to keep interest rates high. Recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, more workers not being paid, getting furloughed, or seeing their hours cut. As a result, consumers are having trouble servicing their loans, raising concerns of a crash in the financial sector.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post in December on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to pay off loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nThe Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, a state-backed Russian think tank, said in December the country could face a banking crisis by October if loan troubles worsen and depositors pull out their funds, according to the Post.\n\n“The situation in the Russian economy has deteriorated markedly,” wrote Dmitry Belousov, head of the think tank, in a note seen by the Financial Times. “The economy has entered the brink of stagflation for the first time since early 2023.”\n\nRussia’s financial woes could become even more serious as Europe weighs additional sanctions on so-called shadow fleet tankers used to ship Moscow’s oil. That would add to recent U.S. penalties on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nThe West’s tighter sanctions regime has forced Russia to offer steeper discounts on its crude exports, while the recent slide in global oil prices has already hurt its top revenue generator.\n\nDespite the worsening fiscal outlook, Moscow is still spending heavily on weapons and incentives to lure fresh recruits to the army. To cover revenue shortfalls, Russia has tapped its sovereign wealth fund, but that is running out now too.\n\nRussia has also suffered staggering losses on the battlefield, with an estimated 1.2 million killed or wounded since the war began. Last month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said more than 30,000 Russian troops died in December alone—an average of 1,000 each day—to gain only minimal territory.\n\nAt the same time, European officials have pointed out that Russia is losing strategically, with Ukraine likely headed for EU membership, NATO growing larger after adding new member states, and Europe ramping up defense spending significantly.\n\n“So people are saying that Russia wants to continue the war because they want more territory—that’s rubbish,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month at the World Economic Forum. “Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail. When you add on to that the Russian economy is in shambles, which means they’re not going to be able to pay their soldiers which means zero growth, end of reserves, interest rates and inflation in double digits. So Putin cannot afford to end this war. This is my big worry.”\n\nIndeed, while Russia has engaged in on-again, off-again talks to end the war, it continues to bombard Ukraine with missiles and drones, targeting its energy infrastructure.\n\nRussian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials just ended two days of talks in Abu Dhabi with little progress reported. In comments released on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. wants the war to end by June and plans a fresh round of negotiations.\n\n“America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams—Ukraine and Russia—meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "TAIPEI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - It would be \"impossible\" to move 40% of Taiwan's semiconductor capacity to the U.S., the island's top tariff negotiator said, pushing back against recent comments by American ​officials who called for a major production shift.\n\nIn an interview with Taiwanese television channel CTS that ‌was broadcast late on Sunday, Taiwan Vice Premier Cheng Li-chiun said she had made it clear to Washington that Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem, ‌built up over decades, could not be relocated.\n\n\"I have made it very clear to the United States that this is impossible,\" she said, referring to the 40% goal the U.S. has floated.\n\nThat ecosystem will continue to grow in Taiwan, Cheng said, adding that the semiconductor industry would keep investing at home.\n\n\"Our overall capacity (in Taiwan) will only continue ⁠to grow,\" she said. \"But we can ‌expand our presence in the United States.\"\n\n\"Our international expansion, including increased investment in the United States, is based on the premise that we remain firmly rooted in Taiwan ‍and continue to expand investment at home.\"\n\nHow much is Taiwan investing in US manufacturing?\n\nWhat is Taiwan's semiconductor ecosystem competitive advantage?\n\nWhat are the US tariff threats over semiconductor production?\n\nWhy does Taiwan reject US semiconductor relocation demands?\n\nOn Tuesday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said the government needed to bring semiconductors to the U.S.\n\n\"You can't have all semiconductor manufacturing 80 miles from China,\" he said. \"That's just illogical ... So we need to bring ​it back.\"\n\n\"When we leave office my goal, for this administration, is 40% market share in leading-edge semiconductor ‌manufacturing.\"\n\nTaiwan and the U.S. reached a deal last month to lower tariffs on the island's exports to 15% from 20% and for Taiwan to increase its investment in the country.\n\nCheng said that there would be no relocation of Taiwan's science parks, but Taiwan was willing to share its experience in building an industry cluster and help the U.S. develop a similar environment.\n\nShe also said she was confident that Taiwan's semiconductor capacity - including existing, ⁠under construction and planned projects across advanced manufacturing, advanced packaging ​and the broader supply chain - would far exceed its investment ​in the U.S. or any other country.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC last month, Lutnick said his goal was to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire chip supply chain and production ‍to the U.S. He said ⁠that if this does not happen, tariffs on Taiwan would likely rise to 100%.",

    "fullText": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The man who killed 51 Muslim worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand’s deadliest mass shooting told an appeals court Monday that he felt forced to admit to the crimes because of “irrationality” due to harsh prison conditions, as he sought to have his guilty pleas discarded.\n\nA panel of three judges at the Court of Appeal in Wellington will hear five days of evidence about Brenton Tarrant’s claim that he was not fit to plead to the terrorism, murder and attempted murder charges he faced after the 2019 attack in the city of Christchurch. If his bid is successful, his case would return to court for a trial, which was averted in March 2020 when he admitted to the hate-fueled shooting.\n\nHe is also seeking to appeal his sentence of life without the chance of parole, which had never been imposed in New Zealand before. Tarrant’s evidence Monday about his mental state when he pleaded guilty was the first time he had spoken substantively in a public setting since he livestreamed the 2019 massacre on Facebook.\n\nShooter says he suffered “nervous exhaustion”\n\nThe Australian man, a self-declared white supremacist, migrated to New Zealand with a view to committing the massacre, which he planned in detail. He amassed a cache of semiautomatic weapons, took steps to avoid detection and wrote a lengthy manifesto before he drove from Dunedin to Christchurch in March 2019 and opened fire at two mosques.\n\nAlong with 51 people killed, the youngest a 3-year-old boy, dozens of others were severely wounded. The attack was considered one of New Zealand’s darkest days and institutions have sought to curb the spread of Tarrant’s message through legal orders and a ban on possession of his manifesto or video of the attack.\n\nMonday’s hearing took place under tight security constraints that severely limited who could view Tarrant’s evidence, which included some reporters and those hurt or bereaved in the massacre. Tarrant, who wore a white button-down shirt and black-rimmed glasses and had a shaved head, spoke on video from a white-walled room at Auckland Prison.\n\nAnswering questions from a Crown lawyer and from lawyers representing him, Tarrant, 35, said his mental health had deteriorated due to conditions in prison, where he was held in solitary confinement with limited reading material or contact with other prisoners.\n\nCrown lawyers say no evidence of serious mental illness\n\nCrown lawyer Barnaby Hawes suggested to Tarrant during questioning that the Australian man had other options. He could have requested a delay in his trial date on mental health grounds or could have proceeded to trial and defended himself, Hawes said.\n\nHawes also put to Tarrant that there was little evidence in the documentation of his behavior by mental health experts and prison staff that he was in any kind of serious mental crisis. Tarrant suggested that signs of mental illness he displayed hadn’t been recorded and that at times he had sought to mask them.\n\n“I was definitely doing everything possible to come across as confident, assured, mentally well,” he told the court. Tarrant’s behavior “reflected the political movement I’m a part of,” he added. “So I always wanted to put on the best front possible.”\n\nHe agreed that he had had access to legal advice throughout the court process. Tarrant’s current lawyers have been granted name suppression because they feared representing him would make them unsafe.\n\nThe appeal outcome is due later\n\nBids to appeal convictions or sentences in New Zealand must be made within 20 working days. Tarrant was about two years late in seeking an appeal, filing documents with the court in September 2022.\n\nHe told the court Monday that his bid had been late because he hadn’t had access to the information required to make it.\n\nThe hearing is due to run for the rest of the week but the judges are expected to release their decision at a later date. If they reject Tarrant’s attempt to have his guilty pleas discarded, a later hearing will focus on his bid to appeal his sentence.",

    "fullText": "KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — It is pre-dawn in the historic Podil district of the Ukraine capital, Kyiv, and warm light from the Spelta bakery-bistro’s window pierces the darkness outside. On a wooden surface dusted with flour, the baker Oleksandr Kutsenko skilfully divides and shapes soft, damp pieces of dough. As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "title": "‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain",
    "description": "Lack of a state floodplain policy in Texas enabled oil companies to build in areas hit by an epic inundation less than 30 years ago.",
    "fullText": "GONZALES - More than 500 enormous oil tanks dot the floodplains of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries across one of Texas' leading oil fields, posing risk of environmental disaster in a flood climatologists say is almost certain to come.\n\nLongtime residents of this area's historic ranchlands vividly remember the last time these plains filled with water, in a biblical inundation in 1998. But that was before the fracking boom that hit the region because of the oil-rich geological formation that lies beneath it, known as the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nToday, a repeat of the historic flood could wreak havoc, an Inside Climate News investigation has found.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of tanks full of oil that are going to float away,\" said Sara Dubose, a fifth-generation landowner in Gonzales County with 10 tanks in the floodplain on her family's ranchlands, each holding up to 21,000 gallons of oil or toxic wastewater. \"Spill all over our land and ruin it for 100 years.\"\n\nAlmost 20 feet of water could submerge some of the tanks on the Dubose family's land in a flooding event similar to 1998, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nInside Climate News scoured satellite imagery of the area to identify batteries of oil tanks and other oil field infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale near waterways in the Guadalupe River Basin. Using latitude and longitude coordinates of each tank battery, the analysis used FEMA flood mapping data to extract the agency's estimates for the depths of its benchmark flood scenarios at each location.\n\nIn some areas, the 1998 flood exceeded the worst-case scenario considered by disaster planners. FEMA calls it the \"500-year flood,\" a hypothetical event the agency estimates has a 0.2% chance of happening in any year.\n\nToday, a 500-year flood across the entire area analyzed would cover at least 22 tank batteries containing 144 individual oil and wastewater tanks with 10 or more feet of water. Of those, 12 tanks would sit beneath at least 20 feet of water.\n\nFEMA's estimates for a 500-year flood understate present risk in many locations, research shows, as warming air and oceans continue to fuel an intensification of extreme rainfall.\n\nDubose experienced the 1998 flood, when the Guadalupe River sprang from its banks and filled the shallow valleys at the edge of these coastal plains. The water almost reached her house, 7 miles from the river, where it trapped her for a week, covering U.S. 183 in both directions as it drained slowly into San Antonio Bay on the coast.\n\nIn a warming world with more intense rainfall, a future flood could be even more severe.\n\n\"One day, it's going to happen,\" Dubose said. \"We've all been concerned about the oil field flooding.\"\n\nWhen flooding hit a smaller oil field in 2013 in northeastern Colorado, authorities tallied two dozen overturned tanks and almost 90,000 gallons of oil and wastewater spilled. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, millions of gallons of oil spilled when several supersized storage tanks floated off their pads. In 1994, flooding on the San Jacinto River in East Texas severed eight pipelines, ignited massive fires, injured hundreds of people and released more than 2 million gallons of petroleum products.\n\nLast summer, severe flooding in the Texas Hill Country near Kerrville washed away a girls' summer camp and killed more than 100 people along the Guadalupe River, 150 miles upstream from the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nThe rules for building in floodplains in Texas fall to county governments, often small and rural. The 78 tank batteries in the Guadalupe floodplains analyzed all sit within Gonzales and DeWitt counties, which have a combined population of about 40,000 people.\n\nIt was left to the governments of the two counties to design and implement floodplain policies during the shale oil boom.\n\n\"Those are not issues that most counties, on an individual basis, are well suited to handle,\" said Todd Votteler, former executive manager of science, intergovernmental relations and policy at the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. \"It raises a question of how serious the state is about avoiding future flood damage in high-risk areas if we don't have a statewide policy.\"\n\nTank batteries at well sites aren't typically secured to the ground by anything but the weight of the equipment and the oil and wastewater inside them. While they are especially vulnerable, they aren't the only industry infrastructure that could be affected by flooding. Eight oil pipelines and about two dozen gas pipelines also cross the Guadalupe River in the Eagle Ford Shale, and others cross local creeks.\n\nThe batteries in the floodplain on Dubose's property were previously operated by Canadian firm Baytex Energy, which sold all of its Eagle Ford Shale assets in November for $3.2 billion to an undisclosed buyer. Other operators with numerous batteries in the floodplains include EOG Resources, Devon Energy and Burlington Resources, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe floodplains also contain many open and buried pits of drilling waste. Dubose unsuccessfully sued an oil company in 2018, alleging that the unlined pit where it buried drilling mud and wastewater on her property was responsible for the orange, gassy goo that seeped up from the earth during heavy rainfall.\n\n\"Think about all the stuff that's soaked into the ground,\" said David Muir, a fifth-generation landowner with more than a dozen wells on his property. \"They've got thousands of chemicals that go into the drilling mud.\"\n\nMuir's land has been in his family since the 1840s. Outside his old, single-story ranch house near the border of Gonzales and DeWitt counties, a private airplane hangar and a waterpark-style swimming pool commemorate the riches fracking has brought to the region.\n\nInside the house between clamoring dogs, Muir sifted through boxes of photos that predated the shale boom. He pulled out strips of 11 film photos taped together to show the vast landscape of water that overtook this rolling savannah on the morning of Oct. 17, 1998.\n\nIt rose far past the tops of the trees. It even covered a spot on Muir's land where a tank battery now stands, 1.5 miles from the Guadalupe River.\n\n\"I thought the whole world was going to flood,\" he said as he flipped through the old pictures. \"We haven't had a flood like that since the oil field hit us.\"\n\nIt all seemed to happen in minutes, recalled Ben Prause, a former elected executive of DeWitt County who presided during the flood. The water wasn't even raging but almost calm as it swiftly rose up to swallow about two-thirds of the town of Cuero. In one case, he said, sheriff's deputies entered a home with water to their knees to save an old woman. When they walked out minutes later, the water was at their chests.\n\n\"It was so rapid,\" said Prause, 92, at his home in downtown Cuero, a few blocks from the 1998 waterline. \"It was just terrible. Water was everywhere.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the Guadalupe River, he said. Several major tributaries also flooded to make the situation worse. Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of Plum Creek and Sandies Creek, which both gushed simultaneously into the Guadalupe.\n\n\"What made it so bad is they all hit about the same time,\" he said.\n\nThese creeks barely trickle for most of the year, said Prause, a 1950 graduate of Cuero High School, but on rare occasions their large floodplains fill.\n\nIn 1998 the floodwaters south of Gonzales were several miles wide, said a report issued the next year by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and FEMA, exceeding predicted worst-case scenarios in some areas.\n\n\"It was the flood that many thought would never happen,\" the report said. \"Unfortunately, an even greater flood will occur sometime in the future.\"\n\nThe 1998 flood caused a few oil spills, said James Dodson, 71, co-founder of the San Antonio Bay Partnership and the son of a South Texas pipeline technician. His late wife worked for Texas' environmental regulator and spent weeks overseeing cleanups. But the extent of oil field infrastructure at that time was nothing compared with today.\n\n\"That was long before the Eagle Ford Shale plays came along,\" he said. \"The landscape was so much different in that regard - there's so many more facilities and well pads now.\"\n\nToday, along one eastward turn in the Guadalupe's snaking course, three batteries consisting of 15 tanks would sit under about 20 feet of water in a 500-year flood. One of them, operated by EOG Resources, is just 500 feet from the riverbank.\n\nTwo miles from the Guadalupe River, four tanks operated by Burlington Resources would take on almost 23 feet of water.\n\nNear Boggy Creek, east of the Guadalupe River by the small town of Dreyer, 10 feet of water would cover EOG Resources' Shiner Hub gas processing plant, a complex of 14 tanks, pipes, motors, chemical separators and flares.\n\nAlong Peach Creek, southeast of Gonzales, batteries of 12 and 28 tanks previously operated by Baytex Energy would sit under 13 feet and 8 feet of water, respectively.\n\nThe oil from toppled tanks probably wouldn't spill onto the land around them, said Dodson, a former water department director for the city of Corpus Christi who worked South Texas oil fields in the 1970s. Instead, he predicted, it would float on the water and end up at the edge of the flood's crest, like the rings in a bathtub. More of it, he said, would wash over the creeks and estuaries of San Antonio Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlager, an 89-year-old Catholic nun from Cuero. \"They have these oil wells all through these areas that flooded like it's no problem.\"\n\nThe oil field infrastructure dates back less than 20 years to the shale revolution, when innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unleashed an explosion of new oil exploration.\n\nBack then, Riebschlager, the daughter of a local civic leader, conducted town hall meetings for local families baffled by the swarm of businessmen and lawyers descending on their sleepy countryside, whipping up 100-page contracts and casually writing checks for mind-boggling sums.\n\nMany landowners warned the oil companies about flooding, she said.\n\nRiebschlager related the story of one rancher: \"When they were getting ready to drill there, he said, ‘Please don't drill them here, it's a floodplain. They will flood.' The oil man says, ‘Don't worry, we'll have all the oil and gas out of this ground before the next flood.' ‘\n\nDubose, who missed out on the riches of the oil boom because her mother sold her family's mineral rights, got a similar answer when she mentioned the 1998 floods to the company drilling on her land. She recalls a man telling her: ‘That was a 100-year flood so it won't happen for another 100 years.'\n\nThat's a common misconception surrounding terms like a 100-year and the 500-year flood, said Matthew Berg, CEO of Houston-based water risk management firm Simfero. A former water specialist with Texas A&M AgriLife, he understands why the general public is misled.\n\n\"They would understand a 100-year flood only happens once every 100 years,\" he said. \"That's a problem because statistics don't work that way.\"\n\nSuch flood events don't literally return only once every century. Rather, computer models estimate that such an event has a 1% chance of occurring at any given spot in a year. What happened in previous years doesn't change those odds.\n\nFurthermore, Berg said, these estimated probabilities are \"to some extent meaningless\" where records go back barely 100 years. They are meant for purposes of development planning, not weather forecasting. The likelihood of storms across centuries isn't known. Neither is when the 500-year floodplain of the Guadalupe River may fill up again. Two things are certain, though: It will fill again and the chances are increasing.\n\nThe warming climate is making precipitation more intense in Texas and beyond. A similar amount of rain falls in fewer, more concentrated storms than it used to, according to a 2024 report from the Office of the Texas State Climatologist at Texas A&M University.\n\n\"Many studies have documented an increase in extreme rainfall in Texas and surrounding areas,\" the report said. \"Extreme rainfall is strongly affected by increased temperatures.\"\n\nIn Texas, as elsewhere on the planet, all 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2011. Warming is a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, released in large part by burning fossil fuels like the oil in the tanks sitting in the floodplains across the Eagle Ford Shale. And warmer air can hold more water vapor, leading to heavier downpours.\n\nIf global fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb, so will extreme rainfall.\n\n\"Extreme precipitation is expected to increase in intensity on average statewide,\" the state climatologist's report said. \"We anticipate an additional increase of about 10% in expected extreme rainfall intensity in 2036 compared to 2001-2020 and an overall increase of over 20% compared to 1950-1999.\"\n\nThose changes in rainfall intensity correspond to a 50% increase in the likelihood of extreme precipitation compared to 2001-2020, the report said, and a 100% increase compared to 1950-1999.\n\nHowever, heavy rains alone don't always make a mega-flood. They have to fall on just the right areas, across multiple tributaries of a single river so that their waters all converge at once downstream.\n\nIf a 500-year flood returns to the Eagle Ford Shale, it's hard to tell how much oil, wastewater and other petroleum fluids could spill. Conventional oil field tanks range from 210 to 750 barrels in size, or from 13,000 to 32,000 gallons. Typical tank batteries in the Eagle Ford often include five 500-barrel oil tanks and one 500-barrel wastewater tank, according to an investor presentation by Baytex Energy. Some are out of use or empty, some are full, most are in between.\n\nWhatever fluids wash down the river would flow into San Antonio Bay, part of the winter grounds for the world's last flock of wild, endangered whooping cranes, then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"With a flood, it causes a lot more dispersion. It breaks it up then you've got oil mixed with sediment and debris. It can stink and it's much, much harder to clean up,\" said Diane Wilson, founder of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and a 77-year-old former shrimper who lives near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. \"It would be unbelievable, the damage it could do.\"\n\nLast summer, Dubose said, she thought it was about to happen. As soon as she saw the news late at night on the Fourth of July, she rushed out and sped her white Hummer down ranch roads to the river.\n\nIncredible rainfall was hitting the Guadalupe about 150 miles upstream in the Hill Country. Online posts said the water had washed away a summer camp for girls.\n\nDubose had flashbacks to 1998, when there were also overnight rainstorms far upriver that put this region underwater for a week. So she hurried to save a mobile home parked at her fishing camp by the river, the same spot where she'd lost a mobile home in 1998.\n\nAlmost there, she passed nervously between the towering, three-story tank batteries in the floodplain on her land, then past the site of the buried waste where, she said, the grass dies each time heavy rains bring the water table to the surface.\n\nLuckily for Dubose, no torrent came downriver. For Kerrville, in the Hill Country, it was the worst flood since 1987. But all the heavy rain fell upstream of a major dam and reservoir, where water levels were low enough to absorb it. So the Eagle Ford Shale was spared, for now.\n\n\"What happened in Kerrville, if that happens here, that's a really bad situation,\" Dubose said. \"We've told the oil field, this is going to flood someday.\"\n\nThis report is published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain.",

    "fullText": "Feb 8 (Reuters) - A prominent Venezuelan opposition politician was kidnapped in Caracas on Sunday night just hours after his release from jail, according to his son and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina ​Machado, casting uncertainty over government vows to free political prisoners.\n\nJuan Pablo Guanipa, a close ally of opposition ‌leader Machado, was freed earlier on Sunday after more than eight months in jail on accusations of leading a terrorist plot, after months in ‌hiding.\n\nHis release followed promises by Venezuela's government to pass an amnesty law and release more prisoners, as U.S. pressure mounts a month after the Trump administration captured and deposed long-time leader Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGuanipa's son Ramon Guanipa said in a video on social media his father was ambushed by 10 heavily armed, unidentified men who he called \"officials.\"\n\n\"My father has again been kidnapped,\" he ⁠said. \"I demand proof of life immediately.\"\n\nVenezuela's government ‌did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Guanipa's disappearance following his release.\n\nMachado, who won the Nobel for her efforts to unseat Maduro, also urged Guanipa's release.\n\n\"Heavily armed men ‍dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force,\" she said in a post on X, noting the incident took place in the Los Chorros area of the capital Caracas.\n\nJust hours before, the elder Guanipa had posted videos to ​social media in which he spoke to journalists and a crowd of cheering supporters. He urged the release ‌of other political prisoners and called the current administration illegitimate.\n\nMaduro's reelection in 2024 was widely seen as rigged and a number of countries, including the U.S., do not recognize his government's legitimacy.\n\nGuanipa said in an interview with a local online outlet that he spoke briefly with Machado after being let go, and hoped to speak with her further the next day.\n\nVenezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years that the country's socialist government uses detentions to stamp ⁠out dissent.\n\nThe government denies holding political prisoners and says those jailed ​have committed crimes. Officials say nearly 900 of these people have been ​released, but they have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including releases from previous years. The government has not provided an official list of how many prisoners will ‍be released or revealed their ⁠identities.\n\nRights group Foro Penal has said 383 political prisoners had been let go since the Venezuelan government announced on January 8 that it would begin a new series of releases. It counted another 35 releases on ⁠Sunday, including opposition politician Freddy Superlano and lawyer Perkins Rocha, also close allies of Machado.\n\nThe group's director Alfredo Romero said on social media they ‌did not yet have clear information about who took Guanipa.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) sent a searing letter in which he stated his intention to ask Ghislaine Maxwell if she or Jeffrey Epstein ever procured “underage girls” for President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-TN) announced last month that Maxwell would be deposed by the committee, and that deposition is scheduled for this Monday.\n\nBut on Sunday, Maxwell’s attorney made clear she intends to plead the Fifth Amendment.\n\nCongressman Khanna, the ranking member on the committee, responded with a searing letter to Comer listing the questions he planned to ask Maxwell — including a few loaded ones about Trump:\n\n4. It is well documented that you, President Donald Trump, and Mr. Epstein had a social relationship, and there are several photographs of you together. Did you or Mr. Epstein ever arrange, facilitate, or provide access to underage girls to President Trump?\n\n5. After President Trump publicly stated that he would “look at” a possible pardon for you, did you or anyone acting on your behalf have any discussions with him or his representatives about a pardon or reduced sentence in exchange for your silence?\n\nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC\n\nIt is my understanding that Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell intends to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and decline to answer all substantive questions at her upcoming deposition before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThis position appears inconsistent with Ms. Maxwell’s prior conduct, as she did not invoke the Fifth Amendment when she previously met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss substantially similar subject matter.\n\nI understand that Ms. Maxwell intends to assert this privilege on a “blanket basis” by reading a prepared statement at the outset of the deposition and refusing to permit Members to question her individually through counsel, rather than invoking the privilege on a question-by-question basis.\n\nAccordingly, for the sake of clarity, I am submitting in this letter the questions I intend to ask at Ms. Maxwell’s deposition and request confirmation from the Chair as to whether she intends to invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to the following questions:\n\n1. On December 17, 2025, you filed a habeas corpus petition stating that “four named co-conspirators” and 25 men who entered into secret settlements were not indicted as part of the investigation. Is that statement accurate?\n\n2. Who are the four co-conspirators and the 25 men, other than Jeffrey Epstein, who sexually abused minors at Epstein’s island, his New Mexico ranch, or his New York residence, and why do you believe they were not indicted?\n\n3. What information, evidence, or personal knowledge do you have regarding why these individuals were not charged or prosecuted by federal authorities?\n\n4. It is well documented that you, President Donald Trump, and Mr. Epstein had a social relationship, and there are several photographs of you together. Did you or Mr. Epstein ever arrange, facilitate, or provide access to underage girls to President Trump?\n\n5. After President Trump publicly stated that he would “look at” a possible pardon for you, did you or anyone acting on your behalf have any discussions with him or his representatives about a pardon or reduced sentence in exchange for your silence?\n\n6. What client lists or records did you or Mr. Epstein maintain that document the identities of clients or associates?\n\n7. Please identify any foreign governments or intelligence services, including those associated with Russia and Israel, that Mr. Epstein shared information with or otherwise acted on behalf of, and describe the nature and purpose of any such relationships.\n\nTo avoid any doubt about the scope of Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment claim, please confirm that Ms. Maxwell intends to invoke the Fifth Amendment on these questions. Furthermore, I request this document be moved into the official record at the start of Ms. Maxwell’s deposition.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nThe post BREAKING: Searing Dem Letter Asks Ghislaine Maxwell If She or Epstein Procured ‘Underage Girls to President Trump’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The White House’s Board of Peace aims to advance Gaza ceasefire, but Hamas control, armed militias, and Rafah crossing delays pose major challenges.\n\nThe White House is planning to host a meeting of its Board of Peace on February 19, Axios reported over the weekend. This is important because it continues to try to push forward the ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHowever, as recent Israeli airstrikes have shown, there are many challenges in Gaza. Hamas is still armed, and it is accused of continuing to plot attacks or cause chaos in Gaza.\n\nThe Board of Peace is supposed to support reconstruction, as well as an international security force and the disarmament ofHamas. In addition, it has an executive board and also a High Representative for Gaza. With so many moving parts, a meeting in mid-February is important.\n\nUS President ratified the Board of Peace on January 22. The second phase of the Gaza plan began in January. US Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have been pushing for investment in Gaza and reconstruction and other elements of the ceasefire to move forward. Both men were on the US aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln over the weekend as US-Iran tensions continue.\n\nWhen the Board of Peace was ratified, the Chief Commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, Dr. Ali Sha’ath, said, “I want to start by thanking President Donald J. Trump and his Administration for his intensive efforts to advance peace in the whole region… These efforts created the opportunity for a new future in Gaza, but what will really matter is what comes next.”\n\nShaath is supposed to be running the technical committee that is supposed to help Gaza move toward peace in this phase. However, it doesn't appear his committee has been allowed to do any real work in Gaza. Israel appears to oppose the committee and oppose any links to the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn essence, this means that Hamas remains in control of Gaza. Officials in Jerusalem have said the Palestinian Authority will have no role in governance in Gaza. They have not said Hamas will have no role in governance, which appears to mean Hamas will remain.\n\nOn the other hand, another phenomenon in Gaza is also concerning. Reports that various militias in Gaza are harassing Gazans who seek to come and go from Rafah raise questions about the policy of having armed militias in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Israel’s Ynet, “four days after Rafah crossing reopened, Gaza residents still disappointed. Only about 20 patients have been allowed to leave Gaza out of some 22,000 requests, while just 75 people have returned after lengthy inspections, limited to one suitcase, a phone, and 600 dollars, amid reports of harassment by Abu Shabab militiamen.”\n\nThe report goes on to say that the frustration Gazans feel from long waits at the border is compounded by having to deal with what appears to be lawlessness in the areas between the border and the half of Gaza still controlled by Hamas.\n\n“Adding to the frustration are reports of involvement by members of the Abu Shabab militia from Rafah, which is backed by Israel, in interrogating and detaining those returning to Gaza. Palestinian media, particularly Hamas outlets, highlighted the account of Rutanah al-Rakab, who returned from Egypt this week.”\n\nThe report notes that one woman said, “after the inspections on the Palestinian side ended, militiamen arrived, declared that they were our brothers and that they were fighting Hamas…They grabbed me and tried to hand me over to Israeli forces, but foreign officials operating at the crossing, apparently European monitors, prevented it.”\n\nSome people said they are being interrogated by the militias, and even handcuffed and blindfolded. They also complain of theft by the militia. The question now remains why Gazans are being given this stark choice of living under Hamas rule, which they have known since 2007, and the chaos of militias.\n\nIf the people in Gaza feel the militias are a worse choice than Hamas, then they will gravitate back towards Hamas rule. In addition, it’s not clear what laws the militias operate under to extrajudicially detain people. The reports at Ynet about the militias and the fact that they are armed raise many questions about what is happening in Gaza.\n\nMost successful societies are not run by militias. For instance, the fate of armed groups in Yemen and Syria illustrates how fragile these types of groups can be. The same is true in Iraq, where the US backed what was called the “awakening” of various Sunni tribes in Anbar between 2006 and 2008.\n\nWhile initially successful, the tribal groups did not bring security in the long term. In other contexts, successful states have done away with militias in favor of formal professional armies.\n\nGeorge Washington and the Continental Congress, for instance, sought to professionalize the American Revolution after initial gains by militias near Boston in 1775. Israel immediately got rid of the various armed groups that had been at the forefront of the Jewish underground after the War of Independence.\n\nThe Haganah basically became the modern IDF, and the Irgun and Stern groups were abolished as armed forces. This saved Israel from the kind of chaos and infighting that divided the Arab irregular fighters of 1947-1948.\n\nAnother challenge for Gaza is the fact that the opening of the Rafah crossing, a key part of the second phase of the ceasefire, has had many hurdles. CNN reports that “the first week of the partial reopening of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt was marked by confusion and logistical hurdles, according to Palestinians attempting to cross and multiple sources who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity.”\n\nThe report goes on to say that “the disorder resulted in far fewer Palestinians traversing the border between Egypt and Gaza than was expected, nearly two years after Israel seized and shut the crossing.\n\nWhen the partial reopening was announced last week, an Israeli security official told CNN that 150 Palestinians per day would be allowed to leave Gaza, while only 50 would be permitted to enter. But even that detail was unclear, as Egyptian state media reported that only 50 would be allowed to leave and the same number to enter.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump ratified the Board of Peace on January 22. At the time, the new High Representative for Gaza, Nickolay Mladenov, said, “Who would’ve thought two years ago that we would be sitting here with this group of countries, with this leadership, giving the people of Gaza a new chance?… For too long, Gazans, Palestinians, and Israelis have lived with conflict, with death, with destruction. Now, the page turns.”\n\nIn addition, US Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve Witkoff added, “We have achieved a peace deal in Gaza. We have brought the hostages home… And maybe most importantly, we have created a sense of hope for what the future can bring in Gaza and all other places where the Board of Peace will operate. And I am so honored, Mr. President, to have worked on this on your behalf.”\n\nThe February meeting will be an important symbol, a month after the ratification, to get things moving forward. The hurdles of Rafah may have been worked out by then. The question remains now about the role of the militias and whether people in Gaza will have access to any health care or education that is not run by Hamas.\n\nIf the alternative to Hamas is only men with guns in armed militias, it’s unlikely people in Gaza will choose that as a preferred way of life. This will essentially just create another cycle of the status quo of Hamas in power.\n\nOver the years, some voices have argued that it is a good strategy for Jerusalem to divide Gaza from the West Bank by having Hamas in Gaza. After October 7, it’s unclear if that strategy will continue. So far, the status quo is that Hamas has regained its rule in half of Gaza.",

    "description": "Aoi Onodera, 32, decided to renovate the Japanese home that had been in his family since the 1940s rather than let it fall into disuse.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aoi Onodera, 34, which took place at Aoito, the café he manages in Zushi, Japan. His words have been translated and edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up visiting this house. It originally belonged to my grandfather's older sister, and whenever I traveled down from Iwate, the northern prefecture in Japan where I grew up, this was where the family gathered.\n\nLater, I worked as a rehabilitation consultant at hospitals in Osaka and Yokohama. I moved, but this place was always in the back of my mind.\n\nWhen my great aunt passed away about 14 years ago, the house became something of an akiya — technically empty, though relatives still came by now and then.\n\nSix years ago, I started wondering what we should do with the house. It was in rough shape at the time. The house was built in 1940, and it felt wasteful to let it fade.\n\nThat's when the idea of renovating it — and eventually turning it into a café — began to take shape.\n\nWhat you see is pretty consistent with how it looked before. The original 85-year-old tatami is still intact, and the main beam and post structure remain.\n\nThe shoji paper screen doors are intentionally torn, encouraging kids to poke their fingers through them — some adults can't resist, too. The mud walls used to be darker; painting them white brightened the atmosphere a bit, but overall, we kept things close to the original bones. We added what we had to — like the counter — and let the rest speak for itself.\n\nI wanted the café to feel like a third place, somewhere locals and family could gather casually.\n\nI've been running the café for almost four years now. On weekdays, it's mostly locals, and on weekends and holidays, around 30% of customers are tourists.\n\nThe furniture and many of the paintings have been here since I was a kid, but the lighting was my choice. I traveled to shops in cities across Japan — including Kobe, Chiba, and elsewhere — picking pieces, such as a 1960s American lamp, that matched the mood I wanted.\n\nI spent about six months cleaning, repairing, and preparing the house.\n\nUntil I got started at the café, I'd worked only in hospitals — I had no food-and-drink experience at all — so inventing dishes, prepping ingredients, and managing a kitchen were all new to me. Every part was hard at first.\n\nThe menu now features seasonal vegetables from the region. We also serve desserts like tiramisu and cheesecake.\n\nMy younger sister and I run the café together. I take weekends, she handles weekday afternoons. We have a close relationship, so I don't micromanage. I trust her to run things as she sees fit. I leave it to her good judgment.\n\nl didn't open the café to ride the trend of renovating old Japanese homes around the end of COVID, when more foreigners started visiting and buying property. That was never my motivation.\n\nI just didn't want a place, which had been in the family so long, to fall into disuse. One of my relatives still owns it, and I pay rent monthly. My family tells me they're glad the house looks better now, and locals appreciate having a community spot.\n\nWe also host musical performances here. Since the house was built in the 40s, we like to play music from that era — oldies, jazz, that sort of thing. It fits.\n\nI'm 34 now, and when I look at young Japanese today, I notice how differently they think about work and life. They are more balanced, more creative, more intentional than I was in my 20s.\n\nFor me, juggling the café, freelance rehabilitation work, and managing concerts has become the right pace. Back at the hospital, I sometimes get in trouble for doing things my own way and working too freely, so maybe this kind of multi-directional work suits me better. It allows me to express myself.\n\nIn a hospital, my world was doctors, nurses, and patients. Opening the café introduced me to a much wider community: grandparents, kids, tourists, and people whose values and backgrounds I never would've encountered otherwise.\n\nOf course, as with people in any environment, some customers are wonderful; some are thoughtless and create problems for others. But even that teaches me something, that the world is full of people I wouldn't have met if I'd stayed in the hospital forever.\n\nThis aging house, somehow, continues to beckon new life.\n\nDo you have a story to share about renovating your family's house in Japan?

Whatever they end up studying — computer science, English, or philosophy — they can make AI part of it.\n\nI was curious about Cursor and some of the other vibecoding tools, so I joined a few \"Code with AI\" weekend sessions for executives.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Within a matter of hours, we were able to develop different applications. I developed a statement analyzer for a financial services system.\n\nOnce I came back home, I spoke to my family about it and showed them the demo. My children, Usman and Shanzey, are both tech-savvy, so that drove their interest. They attended the same course a few weeks later.\n\nThey were the youngest in the class. The good part was that they were completely independent, so I let them be on their own. That's how they ventured into vibe coding and participated in Cursor's 24-hour weekend hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThey've become more curious about things. Through vibe coding, they've learned to be more creative and to use technology to understand how things work.\n\nNeither of them has a formal technology background — they're not software developers — but they've been able to think through ideas, be more creative, and use technology to solve problems.\n\nTechnology is the biggest enabler. The question is how humans use it — whether for good or bad. If it's for good, what are the guardrails?\n\nUsing it for good means creating value, solving real challenges, and making information more accessible.\n\nManaging screentime is the reason we developed a reward system for Usman because he's young and he loves gaming. Gaming comes as a reward for achieving goals. Those goals include making your own breakfast, making your bed, or helping clean the house.\n\nWhen Shanzey is studying, she can't use AI for the content she's creating — it can't even be AI-inspired. It has to be her original work.\n\nThat's super important because schools validate whether output is AI-generated. The same applies to Usman.\n\nIt's important to have both physical and digital skills. Usman plays football because physical activity is important at his age. Shanzey is focused on school right now — her exams are very important, and getting good grades matters.\n\nI'd say my role is more like a coach — brainstorming with them. My wife does the same, helping them think through ideas and keeping them honest.\n\nI'm often busy with work, so a lot of this couldn't be done without my wife's help.\n\nThere's nothing better than hands-on learning. That's something I've learned over the last few years.\n\nYou will face challenges and go through them. Parents should get their kids to do things, give them challenges, and nurture them as they work through those challenges. With hands-on experience, they can get better results faster.\n\nWith building an app, we co-create the idea, but then the important part is making it happen and reporting back on progress.\n\nAt Google, I work with enterprise customers trying to transform their businesses with AI. I can see what's happening on the ground and how things are changing.\n\nI also see a lot of young talent at Google. They come in thinking about creating apps and learning skills, and I mentor some of them as well.\n\nIt's important to communicate this to my family. I spent time helping them understand how the world is changing and why it's important for them to understand AI.\n\nIt's not about running away from technology. AI will keep advancing, and the only thing you can do is be accustomed to it, no matter what you want to become.\n\nWe're now in a situation where we have very intelligent large language models, and we're also moving toward agentic AI, where you can work with agents that help you do a lot more. Speed and agility are improving, and you can now work within larger ecosystems that combine humans and machines, achieving much more.\n\nIf you know how to coexist and let machines do meaningful work with you, that's a skill to aspire to.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

    "description": "Shn Juay, the co-CEO of \"serious dating app\" Coffee Meets Bagel, said using an AI chatbot to flirt could cause an \"expectation mismatch.\"",
    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence has entered the realm of online dating. But Coffee Meets Bagel's CEO says there's a mark it can't meet.\n\nShn Juay, the co-CEO of the dating app that has around 20 million users worldwide, said her team was exploring how to integrate AI into its app.\n\nBut she said using AI chatbots to flirt with potential matches was taking it one step too far.\n\n\"I'm on the fence about using a chatbot to represent yourself in the online app to flirt better,\" Juay, who is based in Singapore, said.\n\n\"You have to eventually meet your partner offline, and when you meet, there could be an expectation mismatch,\" she said. \"Your partner might think that you were so engaging on the app, but not in person.\"\n\nCoffee Meets Bagel markets its app as \"for serious daters,\" showing users about 20 potential matches daily.\n\nFor Coffee Meets Bagel, AI still has a place in the online dating sphere. Juay said that the company is planning to use AI to detect scammers and catfishers in its app.\n\n\"It is hurting the dating app industry because we see an increase in users who are using AI-generated photos to misrepresent themselves,\" she said.\n\nAnother useful implementation, she said, was using it to help daters ask each other better questions.\n\n\"Chats fizzle out because — in Asia especially — we are more shy and not great at asking each other questions after 'Hi, how are you,' 'What job are you in,' and 'What are your hobbies?'\"\n\nSeveral app makers are exploring ways to add AI to the dating mix.\n\nMatch Group CEO Spencer Rascoff said in a tech event in October that AI is \"changing everything\" about its dating apps. Match Group owns Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid, among others.\n\nIn April, Tinder released \"The Game Game,\" an interactive AI chatbot that allows users to practice flirting for five minutes in \"over-the-top, meet-cute scenarios.\" A Business Insider reporter tried the chatbot and found it largely unhelpful.\n\nGrindr's CEO, George Arison, said on a November earnings call that AI would make its app a \"magical experience.\"\n\nOther apps, like Amata, Facebook Dating, Sitch, and Three Day Rule, work like AI-powered matchmakers, narrowing down the dating pool to appeal to daters experiencing swipe fatigue. A pair of Business Insider reporters who tested the apps found them slightly expensive but appreciated that they did the heavy lifting of planning dates.\n\nAnd some daters are taking matters into their own hands, using AI as a wingman by getting tools like ChatGPT to craft Hinge bios and come up with pickup lines.\n\nCoffee Meets Bagel conducted a survey in November with 1,050 of its users in the US, aged 21 to 35. About 80% said they were comfortable with AI assisting them with dating, such as helping decide who to respond to first based on compatibility and responding to common questions.",

(\"Auntie asked me if I have a lot of girlfriends, a lot of girlfriends / Today I have one, tomorrow I'll have another, but there's no wedding.\")\n\n\"Yo Perreo Sola,\" which loosely translates to \"I Twerk Alone,\" was released as a single from \"YHLQMDLG.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he wrote the song from a woman's perspective (hence the feminine adjective, \"sola,\" in the title) to address sexual harassment in clubs.\n\n\"I wanted a woman's voice to sing it — 'yo perreo sola' — because it doesn't mean the same thing when a man sings it,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"But I do feel like that woman sometimes.\"\n\nThe music video ends with a title card that reads, \"Si no quiere bailar contigo, respeta, ella perrea sola.\" (\"If she doesn't want to dance with you, respect her, she twerks alone.\")\n\n\"Safaera,\" a collaboration with Ñengo Flow and Puerto Rican duo Jowell & Randy, is the 14th track on \"YHLQMDLG.\"\n\n\"Party\" is the 11th track on \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" The studio version features Rauw Alejandro.\n\n\"Voy a Llevarte Pa PR,\" meaning \"I'm Going to Take You to Puerto Rico,\" is the second track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\"\n\n\"Eoo,\" which samples \"Perreo Baby\" by Héctor & Tito, is the 15th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" It won the 2026 Grammy Award for best global music performance.\n\n\"Monaco\" is the second track on Bad Bunny's fifth solo studio album, \"Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana.\"\n\nLady Gaga made an appearance during Bad Bunny's performance to sing a salsa-style version of her hit duet with Bruno Mars (sans Mars).\n\n\"Baile Inolvidable\" is the third track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" The studio version features live salsa arrangements, recorded by students from San Juan's Escuela Libre de Música, according to a press release for the album.\n\n\"Nuevayol\" is the opening track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\"\n\nThe song features a sample of \"Un Verano en Nueva York,\" or \"A Summer in New York,\" originally performed by Andy Montañez and El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico.\n\n\"This album is the result of the experiences that have led me to get to know myself better, even getting to know the rhythms I enjoy most—the ones I truly enjoy singing and creating,\" Bad Bunny said in a statement.\n\n\"I am Puerto Rican, I am Caribbean, and my music, my culture, my country's history run through my veins, from plena to reggaeton,\" he continued. \"At the peak of my career and popularity, I want to show the world who I am.\"\n\nBad Bunny enlisted Ricky Martin to sing \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii,\" a song about American colonization.\n\nThe two Latino singers have worked together in the past; Martin contributed backing vocals to Bad Bunny's 2019 single \"Caro\" and made a cameo in the 2020 music video for \"Yo Visto Así.\"\n\n\"El Apagón,\" which translates to \"The Power Outage,\" is the 16th track on \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" It was later released as the album's seventh single.\n\n\"Café Con Ron\" is the 12th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" The studio version features the Puerto Rican ensemble Los Pleneros de la Cresta.\n\n\"DTMF\" is the 16th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" later released as the album's fourth single.\n\nIt was nominated for both record and song of the year at the 2026 Grammys, but the awards went to \"Luther\" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA and \"Wildflower\" by Billie Eilish, respectively.",

    "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's call for a snap election had rattled markets and triggered a sharp selloff in Japanese government bonds.",
    "fullText": "Japan's bond market is back under scrutiny after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory pushed government bond yields higher, even as stocks surged to record highs.\n\nOn Sunday, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party secured a decisive win in the general election, giving Takaichi a clear mandate and room to pursue her fiscal agenda.\n\nThat agenda includes increased government spending on defense and social welfare, alongside tax cuts — policies markets have long debated for their impact on Japan's already heavy public debt burden.\n\nFollowing Takaichi's win, Japanese equities surged nearly 6% to record highs on optimism around fiscal support for growth.\n\nBonds, however, moved in the opposite direction. Two-year Japanese government bond yields climbed to their highest level in three decades, while benchmark 10-year yields also rose. Bond prices fall when yields rise.\n\nLonger-dated bonds sent a more mixed signal. Japan's longest-maturity debt — typically the most sensitive to concerns about fiscal sustainability — erased mostly early yield spikes. Yields on 30-year bonds were little changed on the day around midday in Japan, after surging to record highs last month.\n\nJapanese bond yields matter far beyond the country's borders because of Japan's outsize role in global capital flows. Years of ultra-low yields have allowed domestic and foreign investors to borrow cheaply and leverage bets on higher-yielding assets such as US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nThat dynamic has refocused attention on how markets are pricing Japan's fiscal and debt risks under Takaichi's leadership.\n\n\"A bigger mandate is likely to fuel concerns about the potential path of spending plans, warranting renewed weakness in JGBs and the Yen, unless the BoJ were to shift towards faster rate hikes,\" wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Saturday before the polls.\n\nThe Goldman analysts wrote that they expect volatility as markets digest the news.\n\nLast month, Takaichi's call for a snap election rattled global markets and triggered a sharp sell-off in Japanese government bonds, as investors worried her fiscal agenda could further strain public finances.\n\nAnalysts at the time warned the move could serve as a cautionary signal for other heavily indebted governments, as rising bond yields risk pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.\n\nTakaichi has since sought to reassure markets. She said she would pursue a sustainable and responsible fiscal policy and would not rely on deficit-covering sovereign bond issuance to fund a two-year suspension of the food consumption tax.\n\nJapanese government bond yields could still rise further, driven by concerns about increased government spending on areas such as defense and AI, according to Min Joo Kang, a senior economist at ING.\n\nNot all analysts agree that the postelection bond sell-off will last. Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research, excluding Japan, said Takaichi's strong election win gives her the political room to avoid messy policy trade-offs and make clearer, more sustainable decisions about government spending.\n\nHe also pointed to Japan's external balance sheet as a key buffer, arguing that domestic investors can redirect capital back into local markets.\n\n\"Japan's significant holdings of foreign assets (as the world's second largest net creditor) puts it in pole position to re-allocate back home to Japanese assets to the benefit of JPY, JGBs and equities,\" Varathan wrote.",

    "description": "BBC Sport Wales looks at how Wrexham have evolved since being taken over by Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac five years ago.",
    "fullText": "Five years ago, Wrexham's fortunes changed immeasurably.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Rob Mac completed their takeover of the north Wales side on 9 February, 2021 after receiving overwhelming approval from the Wrexham Supporters Trust three months earlier.\n\nThe Hollywood stars have overseen three successive promotions, although their impact goes way beyond the club's seismic on-field achievements.\n\nAs defender Max Cleworth puts it, \"it's been a mental few years\".\n\nFive years of Hollywood owners - the Wrexham timeline\n\nWrexham's on field success is plain for all to see, however, background developments and groundworks are equally important to sustain Reynold's and Mac's ambitions for the north Wales club.\n\nRegulars at the Stok Cae Ras - or the millions of viewers watching games on screens around the globe - will also have noticed a number of alterations to the world's oldest international football stadium still in continuous use.\n\nThe stadium's iconic Kop Stand was demolished in 2023 having been abandoned for 16 years.\n\nA temporary stand, holding around 3,000 supporters, was used during the 2024-25 campaign before being removed to pave way for a new permanent stand.\n\nWork on the stand - which will hold 7,500 fans in total, taking the overall capacity at Stok Cae Ras to 18,000 - started early on in the 2025-26 season and is due to be completed in early 2027.\n\nAs they do not own their Colliers Park training complex, Wrexham are regularly required to train elsewhere, including at Carden Park or at The Rock - now owned by the club.\n\nBut even other aspects including catering and travel arrangements - which include flying to some away matches to help aid recovery - have been tweaked to improve performance.\n\n\"The difference is massive,\" said former club captain Ben Tozer, who made 136 appearances and won back-to-back promotions with Wrexham.\n\n\"Even though some of the really big changes might not have happened – like we still don't have our own training ground – the infrastructure has improved every year.\n\n\"The players always felt looked after, but the levels have gone up.\"\n\nThe growth is not limited to the men's first team though. Far from it.\n\nAcademy manager Gus Williams and professional development phase lead coach Craig Knight are now in situ as the club aims to produce more home-grown talent.\n\nThe women's side have made enormous strides too.\n\nWrexham were in the tier two Adran North at the time of the takeover but are now challenging for the top-flight Adran Premier title - with a place in Europe on the line.\n\nThey also face reigning league champions Cardiff City in the final of the Adran Trophy on 22 February - further typifying how they have developed into one of the best women's sides in Wales.\n\nIt has all ensured the difference at the club is stark, particularly for new signing Davis Keillor-Dunn, who recently returned six years after leaving Wrexham.\n\n\"I'm just buzzing to see the club in the place it's in now,\" he told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"It shows you how much work has been put in and you're seeing the fruits of it on the pitch.\"\n\nLittle by little, piece by piece, the club keeps evolving. But the headline-grabbing exploits of the first team have ultimately been the key driver.\n\n\"It's the balance of building the club and understanding that the club needed some foundations put in place for the long-term,\" said manager Phil Parkinson.\n\n\"But also that we needed to fast-track the quality at first team level because the squad had been neglected for many years, no-one's fault, through a lack of finances, and [the owners] have been very supportive in both of those categories.\"\n\nLate transfer flurry sets Wrexham up for run-in\n\nGlobal brand in an EFL world - Wrexham's £48m cash injection explained\n\nA mere 110 days after the high-profile change in ownership, manager Dean Keates left the club with Wrexham having missed out on a play-off spot in the fifth-tier National League.\n\nJust 32 days later, Parkinson was tasked with leading the Welsh side's resurgence. Despite a gut-wrenching end to his first season as manager, a 5-4 defeat by Grimsby Town in the play-offs, it has been quite the ride since then.\n\nParkinson has managed 213 regular season league matches and Wrexham's record over that period borders on the ridiculous, in a positive way, of course.\n\nHe has overseen 125 wins, 51 draws and just 37 losses - with his side scoring 407 goals over that time.\n\nIt gives him an astonishing rate of exactly two points per game and an average of little more than 1.9 goals per match when it comes to regular season league fixtures.\n\nIn 2025, history was made as Wrexham returned to the second tier for the first time in 43 years, having become the first ever team to achieve three successive promotions in the English Football League.\n\nIn preparation for the Championship Wrexham smashed their own transfer record three times last summer, with Liberato Cacace, Lewis O'Brien and then Nathan Broadhead becoming their most expensive signing upon moving to north Wales.\n\nAnd having once again strengthened in the mid-season window, Wrexham are not slowing down.\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\nDefender Cleworth is one of only two players, along with Ryan Barnett, to feature in the National League, League Two, League One and the Championship since Reynolds and Mac bought Wrexham.\n\nOn the back of signing a long-term contract extension with the club in January, the academy product said: \"Since I signed my [first] pro deal, I couldn't really have imagined to be sat here five, six years later in the Championship.\"\n\nWrexham were seventh in the National League when Reynolds and Mac were announced as the club's new owners. At present, they are sixth in the Championship - 73 places higher up the football pyramid.\n\nThe social media growth has also been vast. Wrexham had 41,000 followers on Instagram prior to the takeover, that figure has ballooned to 1.5m.\n\nBut perhaps the clearest indicator of the astronomical growth is the value of the club, which now stands at around £350m, an increase of 17,400% compared to the £2m Reynolds and Mac invested upon completing the takeover in 2021.\n\nWith a top six finish firmly within their grasp this season, the rise is showing no sign of stopping, with Cleworth aptly stating: \"It's been a hell of a ride so far, long may that continue.\"",

    "description": "Who impressed and who has the most to do after a transfixing opening weekend of the Six Nations?",
    "fullText": "France were sensational yet inconsistent, England outpowered Wales and it was very, very wet in Rome.\n\nWho impressed, and who has the most to do after a transfixing opening weekend of the Six Nations?\n\nThursday night was an unconventional starting point for the tournament, and for the first 40 minutes hosts France seemed to be playing a different sport altogether in a 36-14 win against Ireland in Paris.\n\nThe electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey scored twice but it was the way France attacked from every position - and their strength in depth - that really impressed the pundits.\n\nFrance were able to score seemingly at will, and all without all-time top try-scorer Damian Penaud - left out despite scoring 40 tries in 59 appearances for his country.\n\n\"The first-half performance from France was amazing - they blew Ireland away,\" Grand Slam winner Donncha O'Callaghan told 5 Live Sport.\n\n\"They are a level ahead of Ireland, maybe two levels. Ireland couldn't compete.\"\n\nTo Ireland's credit they did threaten a comeback in the second half but France then went again to wrap up an emphatic win.\n\nChris Ashton added on Rugby Union Weekly: \"It was magic. France can flip and flop to different styles seamlessly. There is so much you have to contend with playing against them - you don't know which fire to put out first.\n\n\"It's got to be a worry for everyone. France have so much depth - the sport is getting bigger and bigger in the country.\"\n\nCan France be stopped? They face Wales in Cardiff next Sunday.\n\nCatch up with Six Nations Rugby Special on BBC iPlayer and the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly podcast on BBC Sounds\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nIf anyone can match France for strength in depth it is England, who started their campaign by thrashing Wales 48-7.\n\nWing Henry Arundell was handed a first start for two years and promptly helped himself to a first-half hat-trick, the first treble by an England men's player since Arundell himself scored five tries against Chile at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\n\nIncredibly, it was the team's first Six Nations hat-trick since Jonny May against France in 2019.\n\nBen Earl showed some of the fluency France would admire by moving from number eight to centre late on as England showed they are continuing to move in the right direction.\n\n\"England now realise where they can be,\" former scrum-half Matt Dawson told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"Whether that's winning a Grand Slam or a World Cup, only they will know their internal targets.\n\n\"But you can see that winning a scrum is not enough, scoring a try, not enough, winning the game, not enough. They are setting their standards.\"\n\nDawson's former team-mate Paul Grayson was impressed with England's speed out of the blocks at the start of a new cycle.\n\nHe said: \"England were straight in at full tilt - they were ruthless and accurate.\n\n\"England are exciting to watch now. There are lots of moving pieces being done brilliantly well and that's why England are hard to play against now.\"\n\nTougher challenges await - and England head to Murrayfield next weekend.\n\n'The shirt used to weigh heavy - now England players double in size in it'\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nThat England visit comes at a crucial time for Scotland and their coach Gregor Townsend.\n\nHe came into the tournament courted by Newcastle Red Bulls and with question marks over his commitment to the cause.\n\nA tame display in some horrendous weather in Rome as Italy picked up a famous 18-15 win has left some calling for a change.\n\nFormer Scotland forward John Barclay told Rugby Special: \"I thought before the Six Nations that Scotland had to finish third or above.\n\n\"If they don't, which is now going to be very hard, I think it becomes a necessity to see a change.\n\n\"It's a good group of players and if you are not seeing an improvement there is an option for change. That might be the best thing for Gregor and for Scotland.\"\n\nThe conditions made the going tough, but it was Scotland's heart, not hands, that were questioned.\n\n\"Italy were more aggressive and that's down to desire, not the rain,\" former Scotland and British and Irish Lions prop Peter Wright told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"Townsend is an experienced coach and should have known they couldn't play the rugby they wanted to play in those conditions. Scotland lost the war in the set-pieces.\"\n\nThe defeat was a fifth away loss in a row in the Six Nations for Scotland and their beleaguered coach.\n\nBefore the match, Townsend - who is contracted as head coach until the end of the 2027 World Cup - dismissed a report that he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the World Cup as \"pure speculation\".\n\nMore displays like this may make that contract end date a moot point. Scotland need to dig deep and find another level of performance against England.\n\nExpect recalls for Duhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham to provide energy and - Scotland will hope - ammunition.\n\n'Townsend on the ropes after romp in swamp'\n\nI believe in what we're doing - Townsend\n\nIf that defeat left Scotland in crisis, where exactly are Wales?\n\nThrashed at Twickenham, they have now won only two of their past 24 Tests and have not won a Six Nations match since 2023.\n\nDiscipline is a major issue. Wales conceded 16 penalties against England - the most they have conceded in a Test since 2009 - and had four yellow cards, the joint most any team has been shown in a Six Nations match.\n\nBarclay said Wales' issues are mental, not technical.\n\nThey have shipped 248 points and conceded 34 tries in coach Steve Tandy's first five games in charge.\n\n\"It appears there is so much to try and fix in a week for Wales,\" Barclay said.\n\n\"First up has to be their tackling. Defence is easier to sort than attack - it's a mindset.\n\n\"The lack of intent in the tackle is something to look at. How do you fix ill-discipline? If you fix your defence and be a hard team to beat that will sort itself.\"\n\nWales won a Grand Slam as recently as 2019 and a title in 2021, but are heading towards a third consecutive Wooden Spoon. Next up? Free-scoring France on Sunday.\n\nSame old story for sorry Wales in Six Nations\n\nWe let ourselves and people at home down - Lake\n\nThe opening-day win for Italy was a 17th in the Six Nations - and ninth over Scotland.\n\nTheir best campaigns to date have featured two wins, and matching or beating that may be on the agenda.\n\nItaly's only other home game this year is against England on 7 March, but the Azzurri will surely have their eyes on a trip to Wales a week later.\n\n\"It makes you feel very confident in what you can do,\" captain Michele Lamaro said. \"So now we've got a dream in our head. We keep going on.\"\n\nIt's Ireland away on Saturday for Gonzalo Quesada's side.\n\nItaly punish lacklustre Scotland in Rome rain\n\nWho has the best record in the men's Six Nations?\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.",

    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl half-time show was one big love letter to his native Puerto Rico.\n\nThe 14-minute set included guest performances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, along with cameos from the likes of Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G and Jessica Alba, who could be seen dancing on the porch of his famous casita, a staple of his shows designed to look like a traditional Puerto Rican home.\n\nIt was expected that Bad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, would use his performance as an opportunity to make a political statement against the current US administration, but instead he used it to promote a message of American unity.\n\nTransporting himself through a Latin landscape, with set pieces that included everything from a nail salon to a bar, the Grammy award winner reeled off a medley of his biggest hits, including Tití Me Preguntó, MONACO and BAILE INoLVIDABLE.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who was the world's most-played artist in 2025 according to streaming service Spotify, made history by becoming the first musician to perform a Super Bowl half-time show entirely in Spanish.\n\nBut he did choose to make two statements in English, one with a billboard message reading \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" and the other \"Together, We Are America\" written on a football that he held.\n\nHis performance at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, marked the first time the singer and rapper has performed in the United States since releasing last year's Grammy-award winning album Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos).\n\nPuerto Rico, which is a self-governing territory of the USA, was at the heart of everything in this performance, from his early emergence from a sugarcane field to a set that was meant to represent the sounds and sights of the place he calls home.\n\nFamily also featured heavily - from a young couple getting married in a crowd full of Latino dancers to the symbolic moment of Bad Bunny handing his Grammy award to a small child as his 2026 acceptance speech played on a small television.\n\nClimbing an electricity pylon - symbolising the infrastructure that was ruined during the devastating storm - and rapping at the same time, he appeared to pay tribute to the people who died in the 2017 Hurricane Maria.\n\nBad Bunny further spread a message with his outfit - wearing a beige sweater emblazoned with the number 64.\n\nIt could represent the official death toll, which turned out to be significantly lower than the estimated thousands who died.\n\nPresident Trump's administration was criticised at the time by Puerto Ricans who said it failed to provide the same federal support compared to hurricanes that had occurred on the mainland.\n\nThere were no direct criticisms of President Trump, which some saw as a surprise after his two acceptance speeches at last week's Grammy Awards, which he used as an opportunity to speak out against ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers.\n\nTheir actions have prompted protests in multiple US cities - most recently in Minneapolis, where federal agents shot and killed two Americans, leading to scrutiny of the administration's tactics.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who did not attend this year's Super Bowl, said in January that his administration would be \"reviewing everything\" after the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.\n\nIn his Grammy acceptance speech after his win for best musicá urbana album, Bad Bunny called for \"ICE out\".\n\n\"The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that's more powerful than hate is love, so, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.\"\n\nPresident Trump called Bad Bunny's Super Bowl set \"absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!\" on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nHe added that it was \"an affront to the Greatness of America\".\n\nElements of Bad Bunny's tour set, which has travelled to Central and South America and soon heads to Australia, Japan and Europe, were woven throughout Sunday's performance.\n\nThis included his casita, a house which has gone viral on social media several times for its celebrity guests.\n\nTonight was no different, with Pedro Pascal, Jessica Alba and Cardi B dancing onstage.\n\nOvercoming some early sound issues, the performer leaned heavily on hits from his most recent album, with EoO and DtMF providing some of the high points of the show.\n\nIt was not his first time on the Super Bowl stage - he made a guest appearance with Shakira in 2020 - and he brought confidence as the main star. He swaggered from one corner of the stage to the next all while delivering strong vocals.\n\nLady Gaga was on hand to bring a salsa-inspired rendition of her Bruno Mars collaboration Die With A Smile, and fellow Puerto Rican popstar Ricky Martin sang Lo Que Le Pasó A Hawaii, a song which warns Puerto Ricans to not allow their culture to be erased.\n\nBad Bunny ended his performance by shouting \"God Bless America\" in Spanish and naming multiple North and South American countries, while dancers raised flags in the background, bringing attention to the performer's refusal to bring his world tour in the US, though he did do shows in Puerto Rico.\n\nBad Bunny, who has been producing music since 2013, said in a 2025 interview with i-D that there were \"many reasons\" he would not be performing in the US this time around and \"none of them were out of hate\".\n\nSunday's show represented the best of Latin culture on the sporting world's biggest stage.",

    "fullText": "Pep Guardiola sends Arsenal warning as Manchester City stay in title hunt originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPep Guardiola has insisted the Premier League title race is far from over after Manchester City produced a late turnaround to beat Liverpool 2–1 at Anfield.\n\nCity were staring at a damaging defeat after Dominik Szoboszlai put the hosts ahead with a spectacular free-kick in the 74th minute.\n\nBut the champions showed their resilience late on, with Bernardo Silva drawing City level before Erling Haaland sealed the win from the penalty spot.\n\nThe victory keeps City firmly in the title conversation, although Arsenal remain in control at the summit, holding a six-point advantage.\n\nDespite the gap, Guardiola believes there is still plenty of football left to be played, with City competing across multiple competitions.\n\n\"Despite what has happened today, we have many good things to fight for. Final of the Carabao Cup, FA Cup we are there, Champions League last 16, it’s exciting,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports.\n\nMORE:Highlights and stats from Man City's win at Liverpool\n\n\"We are six points behind Arsenal, okay it is a big gap, because they don’t concede goals, they win all their games, but many things are going to happen, I guess.\"\n\nLooking further ahead, Guardiola pointed to the demanding nature of the run-in, particularly for teams balancing domestic and European commitments.\n\n\"I have a feeling that improving a little bit will not be enough to compete against Arsenal but still we have margin (to improve).\"\n\n\"We have to (play them) at home and of course we have to beat them. And I've said, 13 games in the Premier League, from my point of view, from my little experience, is a lot of time, a lot.\"\n\n\"It’s proper. When you go into the last games playing any team in a relegation battle, it’s a proper game, football game.\"\n\n\"That makes an influence in the title race, that’s why being nine, 10, 11 points is more difficult, that’s why all we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal, being there, and try if they sleep, if they make something (a mistake), use it.\"\n\nCity’s win was also notable historically, completing their first league double over Liverpool since 1937.\n\nFixtures in focus Arsenal face a challenging schedule in the coming weeks, including league trips to Brentford, Wolves and Tottenham, alongside home fixtures against Chelsea and Brighton, plus an FA Cup tie with Wigan.\n\nCity return to Premier League action with a home match against Fulham, before an FA Cup fourth-round clash with Salford City, Newcastle, Leeds and Nottingham Forest follow shortly after.",

    "description": "Derrick Barnes didn’t dominate highlight reels in 2025, but when the numbers were tallied and the film was reviewed, his season told a much louder story than the spotlight ever did.",
    "fullText": "Derrick Barnes’ 2025 season did not always come with the loudest headlines, but by year’s end it was impossible to ignore his impact on the Detroit Lions’ defense. Reliable availability, steady production and timely splash plays defined a campaign that earned Barnes a solid B grade and reinforced his value within a young, evolving linebacker group.\n\nBarnes played in every game, a significant accomplishment for a position group that has often battled attrition in recent years. That consistency alone mattered for a Lions defense that leaned heavily on continuity and trust at the second level. Availability became part of Barnes’ value, allowing Detroit to maintain its rotations and avoid scrambling for answers week to week.\n\nStatistically, Barnes delivered one of the more complete seasons of his career. He finished with 40 total tackles, four sacks and one interception. Barnes was not just a downhill run defender; he was deployed as a pressure piece, a spy and an underneath coverage defender, often within the same series.\n\nThe pass-rush production stood out most. Barnes’ four sacks placed him in rare company within the organization’s history. He became the first Lions linebacker to record at least 4.0 sacks and an interception in a single season since Chris Claiborne did it in 2002, a span of more than two decades. For a franchise that has cycled through linebacker combinations for years, that milestone carried weight.\n\nLeaguewide, Barnes’ production compared favorably as well. He and Jack Campbell each finished with 4.0 sacks, tying each other for the most sacks by any off-ball linebacker in the NFL this season. In a league where pressure increasingly comes from the edges, Barnes’ ability to affect quarterbacks from the second level added a valuable wrinkle to Detroit’s defensive front.\n\nBarnes’ interception underscored his growth in coverage. While he will never be mistaken for a true coverage specialist, his awareness improved noticeably. He showed better spacing in zone drops and a clearer understanding of route concepts developing behind him. Those gains did not eliminate all limitations, but they reduced the number of coverage mismatches opposing offenses could exploit.\n\nAgainst the run, Barnes remained a dependable presence. His 40 tackles do not jump off the stat sheet, but they reflect assignment soundness more than volume. Barnes often did the dirty work — setting edges, filling gaps and freeing up teammates to make plays. His physicality and discipline helped stabilize a defense that asked its linebackers to play fast and decisively.\n\nThe B grade reflects both achievement and remaining room for growth. Barnes was productive and dependable, but not dominant. There were stretches where his snap-to-snap impact waned, particularly against elite passing attacks that tested him in space. Continued refinement in coverage and improved play recognition could elevate him from solid contributor to difference-maker.\n\nStill, Barnes’ 2025 season marked meaningful progress. He stayed healthy, produced career-relevant numbers and etched his name into a small slice of franchise history. In a linebacker room led by Campbell and defined by versatility, Barnes proved he belongs. For Detroit, that combination of reliability and upside made his season a clear success.",

    "description": "Lacey Eden scored a goal and had two assists, and freshman goaltender Rhyah Stewart bounced back to pick up an important win for the Badgers.",
    "fullText": "MADISON – The two best teams in women’s college hockey, now depleted by the Olympics, met for the fourth time this season.\n\nBut other than that, Feb. 8 at LaBahn Arena seemed a lot like any other time when Wisconsin and Ohio State have faced off in recent years, a scrappy, grind-it-out game decided by determination, heads-up play and the right bounces.\n\nAfter a dispiriting loss a day earlier, the top-ranked Badgers got on the board first and went on to a 4-1 victory over the No. 2 Buckeyes. In the process, UW (25-3-2, 19-3-2 WCHA) won its regular seasons series, three games to one and took over the lead over Ohio State (26-4-0, 20-4-0) in the league standings with two weeks remaining before the playoffs.\n\nFifth-year right wing Lacey Eden, left off the Team USA roster for the Milan Cortina Games, needs to do more than ever for a Badgers team without five of its best players.\n\nEden scored the game’s first goal at 16:17 of the first period through a tangle in front of Ohio State goaltender Hailey MacLeod and then assisted on a breakaway by junior center Cassie Hall that made it 2-0 in the second period and on junior defender Laney Potter’s 5-on-3 goal in the third that took the lead to 3-1.\n\n“From the opening faceoff, we were here to play today,” said Eden, who was frustrated a day earlier when the Badgers seemed to be skating in quicksand. “We had that effort that we were talking about yesterday.\n\n“And just getting pucks the net, yeah, definitely the goal was to get up 1-0 and we were able to capitalize on that and I think that helped the momentum for the rest of the game.”\n\nHead coach Mark Johnson couldn’t ask for more from a player who has been an important part of the leadership group through three UW-OSU national championship battles.\n\nNow she has to step up even \n\n“Whether it’s killing a penalty and blocking a shot and what we saw in the first period, scoring a goal in the first period, making a play on the five-on-three, we keep talking, and she keeps playing well,” Johnson said. “Give her a lot of credit because if you watched her, yesterday and then watched again today, there’s a lot of determination and grit, getting knocked down and just getting back up and keep playing. Fun to watch.”\n\nThe Badgers’ fourth goal came from sophomore center Finley McCarthhy just 26 seconds after Potter’s while UW was still on the power play.\n\nOn the other end of the ice, freshman Rhyah Stewart was making her fourth start since McNaughton left for Italy. She stopped 20 shots on goal and held Ohio State 0 for 7 on the power play.\n\n“Definitely the D-zone, it’s a group effort,” Stewart said. “I just do my job to help them back there, but any help I get is always awesome.\n\n“The more reps you get at this level, it’s kind of just you get more comfortable with the speed of the game and to just kind of know the plays that might happen in front of you. So I think that helps with a lot of confidence in the net.”\n\nStewart is 2-2 in McNaughton’s absence after splits against Ohio State and at third-ranked Minnesota and 3-2 overall.\n\n“I was happy for Rhyahj,” Johnson said. “Back to back weekends against two of the top teams in the country, and she looked comfortable out there today. She looked confident and those are the things you want to see in your players, especially your young ones.”\n\nThe Badgers would love to see more of the same as the regular season winds down as they pursue an 11th regular season conference title before their Olympians return.\n\nOver the remaining two weekends they play a pair of games at Minnesota State and then host St. Cloud State at LaBahn. Both are in the bottom half of the WCHA standings.\n\nOhio State hosts Minnesota and then finishes at last-place Bemidji State.\n\nThen come the WCHA tournament and the NCAA tournament, where Wisconsin is 2-1 against Ohio State in the past three championships.\n\n“Every game you should try to hold yourself to that standard of playing it like a championship game, playing it like your last game, or however you want to think about that,” Eden said. “Against a rival like Ohio State, you need that laser focus, you need to be doing those little things. And I hope we can kind of take notes from this game and continue that into the rest of our regular season as a team.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin women's hockey beats Ohio State 4-1, retakes WCHA lead",

The agreement was negotiated using a portion of the Pistons’ bi-annual exception, with Jenkins’ agent Derek Jackson of UNLTD Sports Group representing him in the deal.\n\nJenkins was already with the Pistons and earned the extended commitment through his play so far this season. In 42 games, the 6-foot-4 point guard averaged 8.2 points, 3.3 assists, and 1.8 rebounds, while shooting 43.0% from the field and 39.1% from three-point range.\n\nDetroit values Jenkins’ combination of size, shooting efficiency, and steady ball-handling, and this move gives the organization continued flexibility while rewarding a player who proved he belongs in the NBA rotation conversation.\n\nThe post Detroit Pistons Finalize Contract With Daniss Jenkins appeared first on Detroit Sports Nation.",

She was 7-for-11 from 3-point range and had seven assists.\n\nSakima Walker scored 18 points and Mjracle Sheppard had 14 points and eight assists for Cal, which was coming off a win at Georgia Tech.\n\nThe Bears (15-10, 6-6 ACC) jumped to a 54-32 halftime lead and kept a double-digit edge throughout the second half against the Panthers (8-17, 1-11) while winning for the fifth time in six games.\n\n\"I thought we came out with the right mindset, and were really good in the first half,\" Cal coach Charmin Smith said. \"Obviously, we made shots offensively and we were locked in defensively and did a really good job.

    "description": "A look at what color Gatorade was dumped on the winning coach at Super Bowl 60. Did Mike Vrabel or Mike Macdonald get the bath?",
    "fullText": "Gatorade rose to prominence in the early 1990s due, in part, to a commercial titled “Be Like Mike,” featuring Michael Jordan. A quarter of a century later, two coaches named Mike are facing off on the Super Bowl stage, and there’s a great chance one of them winds up being drenched in Gatorade tonight.\n\nEither the Seahawks’ Mike Macdonald or the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel will likely get the traditional Gatorade shower tonight at Levi’s Stadium. We will post the results of the Super Bowl 60 Gatorade color as soon as the electrolytes hit the turf this evening.\n\nWe will soon have the Super Bowl Gatorade color results. Be sure to check back here immediately after the game to see which color cashed.\n\nThere is so much chaos in the closing minutes and immediate aftermath of the Super Bowl that TV cameras can often miss the Gatorade bath.\n\nThis occurred in 2021 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 in Super Bowl LV. CBS cameras missed Bucs head coach Bruce Arians getting doused, and there were many minutes of speculation online regarding which color landed on his head.\n\nA video from the stadium went viral shortly after the conclusion of the game, revealing that Arians was drenched in blue Gatorade.\n\nBlue was a favorite heading into this year’s game, as it owned +260 Gatorade color odds. Only orange had shorter odds.\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl matchup does not have much background when it comes to Gatorade baths. There is no prior video of Macdonald or Vrabel being hit with a Gatorade bath, as neither has reached the Super Bowl as a head coach before.\n\nNeither was hit with a Gatorade bath in their respective conference championship game this year, either.\n\nHere is a look at what Gatorade color payouts would look like on a $10 bet. Payouts are the total amount you would receive in return on a winning bet. So it’s the $10 you bet upfront plus the amount you actually won.\n\nYellow/Green/Lime (+260): $36.00\n\nNo Gatorade Bath (+5000): $510.00\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "The U.S. has medaled in every Winter Olympic sport, except Biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Can American biathletes end their 66-year shutout at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics?\n\nCampbell Wright offers Team USA's best shot at making a biathlon podium. The 23-year-old represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, but the dual citizenship athlete switched in 2023 to represent the U.S., where his parents were born, and won two silver medals at the 2025 World Championship.\n\nAlthough the biathlon officially made its debut at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Olympics, military patrols are a direct precursor to biathlon and date back to the inaugural 1924 Chamonix Winter Olympics. Military patrols were included in the 1928, 1936 and 1948 Winter Games as a demonstration sport, before the first biathlon was contested in 1960 with the men's 20-km event. Women's events made their debut at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games, while mixed relay was added to the program in 2014 in Sochi.\n\nAthletes strap rifles to their back and ski multiple laps around a cross-country track. After each lap, the skier arrives at a shooting zone and fires five shots at a target from either the standing position or prone position. A missed target results in a penalty: either a lap around a penalty loop or one minute added to the overall time. The winner is determined by either the first to cross the finish line or best overall time, depending on the event.\n\nThere are 11 Olympic biathlon events. Men and women have their own events and there's one mixed relay:\n\n4x6-kilometer mixed relay: Two men and two women\n\nCampbell Wright: The 23-year-old represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics before joining Team USA in October 2023. Wright became the first U.S biathlete to win two medals in a single world championship when he won back-to-back silver medals in sprint and pursuit. He's the first American to win a world championship medal since Susan Dunklee in 2020 and the first American male since Lowell Bailey's gold in the 20 km in 2017.\n\nDeedra Irwin: The 33-year-old is looking to improve on her seventh-place finish in the women's 15km individual race in Beijing in 2022, marking the best-ever Olympic finish for an American biathlete.\n\nFrance dominated the 2025 Biathlon World Championships, winning six golds and 13 total medals, the most of any country, followed by nine total medals for Norway, five for Germany and four for Sweden.\n\nFrance's Quentin Fillon Maillet became the first biathlete to win five medals in a single Winter Games after earning two golds (individual, pursuit) and three silver medals (sprint, relay and mixed relay) in Beijing in 2022. France's Julia Simon won a mixed relay silver medal in Beijing in 2022 and took home four golds at the 2025 world championships (individual, relay, mixed relay and single mixed relay).\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biathlon at 2026 Milano Cortina: How it works, U.S. stars to watch",

    "fullText": "If you were expecting a defensive affair in Super Bowl LX, the first half has lived up to the billing.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks scored a field goal on their opening drive of the game to take a 3-0 lead, but that has been half of the scoring so far as the first half of Super Bowl LX draws to a close with the Seahawks leading the New England Patriots by just 6-0 thanks to two field goals from Jason Myers late in the second quarter.\n\nSo that has us thinking: What are the three lowest scoring Super Bowls in Super Bowl history?\n\nSuper Bowl IX was played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings. Similar to Super Bowl LX, the first half of Super Bowl IX was a true defensive struggle, as the only points came for Pittsburgh on a safety when Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton was taken down in his own end zone.\n\nThe opening kickoff of the second half was fumbled by Minnesota fullback Bill Brown, giving the Steelers incredible field position. Pittsburgh capped off their next possession with a touchdown run from Franco Harris to give Pittsburgh a 9-0 lead.\n\nThe Steelers would go on to win by a final score of 16-9, for a total of 22 points.\n\nSuper Bowl VII capped off a perfect 17-0 season for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nBut interestingly enough, it might be most remembered for how Washington scored their only points of the game, coming on this botched field goal attempt from Miami.\n\nGaro Yepremian’s gaffe aside, the Dolphins took the win, and to date the only perfect season in NFL history.\n\nThat is a total of just 21 points.\n\nInterestingly enough, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history featured the Patriots as well.\n\nTom Brady’s final Super Bowl win with New England came in Super Bowl LIII against the Los Angeles Rams. While Jared Goff and company had chances, the Rams offense never found the end zone. New England scored the lone touchdown of the game on a short plunge from Sony Michel, and wide receiver Julian Edelman — who caught 10 passes for 141 yards — took home Super Bowl MVP.",

The reactions have been a mix of disbelief and jokes. Fans better have come hungry, because this is not some casual snack. They also better not have left their wallets at home.\n\nLevy Restaurants made just 200 of what they’re calling the LX Hammer Burger for Super Bowl Sunday. It’s a loaded cheeseburger with braised bone-in beef shank, roasted mirepoix demi-glace, and blue cheese fondue spilling over the sides. Everything sits on a brioche bun.\n\nHere it is, folks.\n\nThe LX Hammer Burger.\n\nIt’s $180 at the Super Bowl today. @LevyRestaurants is making 200.\n\nIt’s a cheeseburger with braised bone-in beef shank, roasted mirepoix demi-glace, and Point Reyes bleu cheese fondue on baked brioche bun. pic.twitter.com/JgkPQwDerN\n\n— Darren Rovell (@darrenrovell) February 8, 2026\n\nSome fans might be curious enough to give it a shot. Most people online cannot get past the price, calling it another case of Super Bowl excess.\n\nOne fan wrote, “I’d rather bite my thumb off and eat it rather than paying 180 for that. There is no doubts that the burger might be tasty, but for 180, nah. I’m expecting wagyu beef for that sum.”\n\nAnother commented, “At that price they can keep it\n\nalways eat somewhere other than the stadium!”\n\nThe most expensive concession item at Super Bowl LX is a $180 beef shank burger that feeds 4 people\n\n— Front Office Sports (@FOS) February 8, 2026\n\nSomeone else wrote, “Mortgage just for a burger.”\n\nAnother fan added, “The majority of the people that would buy these aren’t sitting in a regular seat. They’ll be in a luxury box.”\n\nOne other fan chimed in, “Stop trying to normalize expensive concessions. I could doordash everything you see here, with a full 3 course meal and it’d cost half the price.”\n\nOne more fan wrote, “I know they need to make some margin but the markup on this is astronomical, even for stadium food.”\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nNBA: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\n\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NFL fans can’t believe the price of this Super Bowl 60 burger appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Kenneth Walker's contract status and projection ahead of 2026 NFL offseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks finally turn the page to the offseason, they'll have a big decision to make on running back Kenneth Walker.\n\nThat's because the former second-round pick is a pending free agent after spending all four of his NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHere's a look at who much Walker is expected to make in free agency.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Walker is estimated to land a four-year, $33.5 million deal in free agency, which is realistic for a few reasons.\n\nFor starters, Walker will be one of the best running backs available in free agency and should draw plenty of interest. Also, Walker has only helped his contract demands with a big showing in the playoffs.\n\nWhat will hurt Walker is the fact that he isn't the most complete back. He's OK as a pass-catcher and struggles in pass protection, so he won't be getting top-of-the-market money.\n\nThe good news for the Seahawks is they are loaded with cap space this offseason, so they'll have no issue re-signing Walker if that's the route they want to go.\n\nCardinals trade rumor could lead to deal with Steelers, Vikings or Browns\n\nAaron Rodgers career update is great news for Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n49ers trade rumor is crushing blow to possible deal with Vikings, Falcons\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't ruling out interesting career change down the line\n\nTravis Kelce rumor offers update on Chiefs superstar's future plans\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor is good news for Pats, Eagles, Cowboys",

    "fullText": "Manchester City were denied a record-equalling 14 consecutive Women’s Super League wins on Sunday after a defeat to Arsenal. The Gunners puts the brakes on City’s title charge with a successful afternoon at the Emirates, thanks to Olivia Smith.\n\nA sole goal from summer signing Smith denied the Citizens from matching the competition’s longest winning streak. The decisive moment came in just the 17th minute, when Mariona Caldentey’s stunning through ball was pounced upon by the Canadian forward. Smith took the ball past Ayala Yamashita and coolly finished into the open net.\n\nThe result has little impact on the league standings, as City still remain top, eight points clear of derby rivals Manchester United. Arsenal however, have a game in-hand due to their participation in FIFA’s Champions Cup, and could close the gap to seven points if they defeat Leicester.\n\nRenée Slegers’s game plan was clear: disrupt City’s rhythm, press high in the central areas, and force defensive mistakes. The first half alone saw Arsenal have nine shots, four of these being on target. Meanwhile, City struggled linking up play between midfield and the attacking third. The away side managed just one shot on target throughout the 90 minutes, which came via Bunny Shaw moments before half-time.\n\nThe midfield partnership of Caldentey and Kim Little proved pivotal in Arsenal’s victory as Man City were forced to play wide, limiting space and time for Vivienne Miedema to dictate play much like she has this season.\n\nDefensively, the Gunners were rock solid. Daphne van Domeselaar looked calm and assured in her first start since November. While Lotte Wubben-Moy and Steph Catley marshalled their lines, limiting City’s attacking prowess.\n\nWinning the Player of the Match, Kim Little’s influence cannot be overlooked. Now 35 years old, the former Scottish international seems to get better with each passing season.\n\nLittle helped the Gunners control the tempo, disrupt City’s flow, and provide calm distribution throughout the 90 minutes. Her experience and reading of the game was pivotal in Arsenal’s dominance and shown in the second half, when a well-timed slide tackle prevented a City counter-attack and allowed the home side to calm the match.\n\nAfter the win, Arsenal’s captain spoke to SkySports and highlighted their growing momentum after recent victories against Chelsea and Corinthians.\n\n“I think we’ve obviously had quite a big week of fixtures when you look at Chelsea and then the Champions Cup last week and now going into Man City,” Little said. “We’ve put in some really great performances throughout the squad, and all the players have done really well.\n\n“We’ve raised to the occasion and obviously a huge part of that is our fans. Being able to play here in North London, to have I think close to 40,000 again today, it’s a pretty special atmosphere.”\n\nDespite trailing in the WSL standings, Little hopes her side can maintain the pressure to the final day.\n\n“I think obviously City have put themselves in a really good position, and our job now is to just push as much as we can until that end game of the season.”\n\nArsenal will hope to continue their fine winning run as they travel to Belgium to face Oud-Heverlee Leuven in the first leg of the UEFA Women’s Champions League play-offs. Having won their previous encounter 3-0, the Gunners will hope to put the tie to bed and continue their title defence.\n\nCity, however, will have five days to prepare ahead of their next league clash against bottom-of-the-table Leicester City.\n\nWSL: Sonia Bompastor extends Chelsea contract until 2030\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback\n\nWSL: Oriane Jean-François departs Chelsea and signs for Aston Villa",

    "fullText": "If it's points you crave, then this Super Bowl will likely not be for you. The 45.5-point total for Seahawks vs. Patriots is the lowest Super Bowl Over/Under in 10 years.\n\nThat said, our Super Bowl predictions won't rule out some fireworks this Sunday night at Levi's Stadium based on recent Big Game history. Each of the past three Super Bowls have gone Over the total.\n\nBelow, we will deliver the Seahawks vs. Patriots final score, and the results for whether or not the Super Bowl total went Over or Under the number.\n\nWe will post the answer to the question of whether the Super Bowl total went Over or Under as soon as the final score is set in stone.\n\nUntil then, here are some nuggets of information regarding the total for Super Bowl 60, and Super Bowl odds history.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots were both Top 10 scoring teams this season. Seattle ranked second overall in team scoring, behind only the LA Rams. Mike Macdonald’s team scored an impressive 29.2 points per game this season.\n\nNew England, meanwhile, ranked eighth in the NFL in points scored — putting up 27.2 ppg. In this year’s playoffs, the Seahawks have had a relatively easy time producing points, while it’s been a slog for the Pats.\n\nThe Seahawks put up 41 points in the Divisional Round against the 49ers, and then scored 31 points against the Rams in the NFC Championship game.\n\nMike Vrabel’s squad has had the unfortunate task of dealing with three of the top-ranked defenses in the NFL in their first three games of this postseason. The Pats scored just 16 points against the Chargers in the Wild Card round, 28 points against the Texans in the Divisional Round, and then scored only 10 points against the Broncos in the AFC Championship game.\n\nBoth the Seahawks and Patriots went Over the total in more games than not this season. The Pats have an Over record of 12-8-0 this season. Seattle, meanwhile, has an Over record of 11-8-0.\n\nDrake Maye and the Patriots have gone Under the total in two of their three playoff games played this winter. Chargers versus Patriots had a total of 45.5 and the two teams combined for just 19 points in the Wild Card round.\n\nTexans versus Patriots had a total of 40.5 points and the two teams combined for 44 points. This past round against the Broncos, the total was 42 points and the two teams combined for a measly 17 points.\n\nAs for the Seahawks, they went Over the total in each of their two playoff games this winter. Against the 49ers in the Divisional Round, the total was set at 44.5. The game went Over as the two teams combined for 48 points.\n\nIn the NFC title game, the Over/Under was 44.5 and the two teams rang up 58 points together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

It's actually three times more than the lowest halftime score in the big game's history, which came in Super Bowl IX following the 1974 season.\n\nIn a struggle between two classic NFL defenses — Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain vs. Minnesota's Purple People Eaters — the only first-half points midway through the second quarter. On second and 7 from his own 10-yard line, Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton lost the ball and had to fall on it in the Vikings' end zone. He was touched by Steelers defensive end Dwight White, who was credited with the sack.\n\nIt was the first safety ever in a Super Bowl, giving Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead that stood at halftime. The Steelers went on to defeat the Vikings 16-6 for their first of four Super Bowl wins in a six-year stretch.\n\nFollowing the 2018 season, the Patriots led the Rams 3-0 at the intermission of Super Bowl LIII, the second-lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history, on a 42-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski early in the second quarter.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "From her sudden departure from WWE to her critical takes on the American immigration enforcement crisis, Simone Garcia Johnson, known previously as \"WWE NXT\" General Manager Ava has been making headlines in the professional wrestling news cycle. The young Johnson's future extends beyond a week's worth of stories, however, and, according to Dave Meltzer, she is possibly set to delve deeper into the film industry.\n\nOn a recent episode of \"Wrestling Observer Radio,\" Meltzer delved into Johnson's departures: both from WWE, and from social media. Shortly after her WWE contract expired, Johnson took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to openly criticize United States President Donald Trump's administration, especially in regards to their controversial immigration enforcement policies. She deleted her X account not long after, and many, including Meltzer, have speculated that Johnson's anti-Trump sentiments could have contributed to her decision to not renew with WWE, a company with historical ties to Trump. However, Meltzer clarified that Ava was never officially told to delete her social media, and that her departure from X was a personal decision.\n\n\"From what I'm told, no one forced her,\" Meltzer clarified. \"But she was going to have to drop the Ava account anyway, because she's not in her contract, and [WWE owns] the name Ava.\"\n\nMeltzer also addressed Johnson's future offline. According to Meltzer, the common belief is that Johnson will work for Seven Bucks Productions, a content production company started by her father, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Seven Bucks Productions has been involved in several notable film projects, both within and outside the realm of professional wrestling, such as \"Baywatch,\" \"Black Adam,\" and \"Fighting with My Family,\" a biographical film regarding former WWE Divas Champion Paige (known also as AEW's Saraya). While the young Johnson's ties to Seven Bucks Productions is strong, her next move post-WWE remains unconfirmed.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "The Patriots are trying to clinch their seventh Lombardi Trophy on Sunday.",
    "fullText": "Despite coming off a four-win season and changing head coaches a year ago, the New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl.\n\nLed by Mike Vrabel and MVP-caliber quarterback Drake Maye, they finished the regular season with a 14-3 record and as the second seed in the AFC playoff picture. As such, they went on to beat the Chargers, Texans and Broncos to punch their ticket to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThere, the NFC’s top seed awaits. The Seattle Seahawks reached the Super Bowl by going 14-3 themselves, and by subsequently beating two division rivals — the 49ers and Rams — in the playoffs.\n\nNow, the two teams meet in Santa Clara with the Vince Lombardi Trophy at play.\n\nHere are our updates live from Levi’s Stadium.\n\nSunday, Feb. 8, 6:30 p.m. ET | Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, CA | Broadcast information | Inactives | Game day roster\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Patriots won the coin toss and deferred, putting the defense on the field first to start Super Bowl 60. After a first down run by Kenneth Walker to move the chains, Sam Darnold found a pair of downfield completions to move inside the red zone. New England’s defense then held strong from there to force a field goal. [Patriots 0 : 3 Seahawks]\n\nNew England’s first drive of the day started with three straight touches for Rhamondre Stevenson, including a third-down conversion through the air. After a 12-yard scramble by Maye then set up a 3rd-and-9 after a sack, a blitz off the blindside resulted in a throwaway and punt.\n\nSeattle’s next drive started back up at their own 10-yard line. Immediately facing a 3rd-and-6, Darnold escaped a blitzing Jaylinn Hawkins but missed a wide open Jaxon Smith-Njigba downfield forcing a punt.\n\nA play-action under center pass out of six their O-line group to Kayshon Boutte started the Patriots next drive with a 21-yard gain. Two straight touches to TreVeyon Henderson then set up a 3rd-and-15, where a Seattle blitz got home again for a sack. New England then punted again.\n\nBehind another good punt by Bryce Baringer and coverage by Dell Pettus, Seattle again started inside their own 20. Two run stuffs then set up a 3rd-and-7, where a check down to Barner moved the chains. A big TFL by Craig Woodson and then a pass breakup got Seattle back into a 3rd-and-15 in which Darnold’s pass was incomplete leading to a punt.\n\nNew England continued to struggle to move the football on their next drive, as an incompletion to an open Hunter Henry was followed by a third-down run stop on Stevenson. New England punted again.\n\nFollowing a big time pass breakup downfield by Christian Gonzalez, running back Kenneth Walker found the edge to break free for 30 yards. Two plays later, Walker found running room again escaping for 29 more to move inside the red zone. With Seattle then facing a 3rd-and-12, a pitch to Walker went for a loss again thanks to Woodson. New England forced another field goal. [Patriots 0 : 6 Seahawks]\n\nWith the deficit now six, a long developing second-down sack forced the Patriots into a 3rd-and-17, where a screen to Stefon Diggs went for just five and another punt.\n\nKenneth Walker picked up a pair of first downs to get the Seahawks over midfield. A third down incompletion to Walker then forced a punt by Seattle, which was downed at the 2-yard line.\n\nBacked up on their own end zone, Maye converted a big third-down to DeMario Douglas for a nine-yard gain. Back in a third-and-long after a false start by Will Campbell, Maye uncorked one downfield in a muddy pocket that fell incomplete to Mack Hollins.\n\nWorking over midfield prior to the two-minute warning, Seattle converted a 3rd-and-2 on the ground with 32 seconds remaining. Set up with another 3rd-and-short after using their final timeouts, Darnold’s pass to JSN in the end zone was broken up and nearly intercepted by Gonzalez. New England then held to another field goal.\n\nWith six seconds left in the half, Drake Maye took a knee.",

    "fullText": "Arizona’s first season in the Big 12 Conference was an eye opener, both in terms of the significant bump in competition from the Pac-12 and the hostile atmospheres it entered. No more trips to half-empty gyms in Corvallis or Pullman, or ones in California with nearly as many UA fans as ones for the home team.\n\nTrips to Lubbock, Manhattan, Ames and Lawrence all ended badly. The opponent had a lot to do with that, but so did the crowds. All four games were sellouts, the atmospheres electric.\n\nThe second time around has been much better for Arizona (23-0, 10-0) on the road in the Big 12. It’s won at Utah, TCU, UCF, BYU and ASU, in addition to a nonconference win at UConn in November, the six consecutive road wins the longest in-season streak since 2016-17.\n\nBut now comes a trip to the last road venue that the UA lost in, Kansas’ Allen Fieldhouse. The Wildcats fell 83-76 in Lawrence to end the 2024-25 regular season, keeping Jayhawks coach Bill Self perfect on Senior Day.\n\nSelf, who is in his 23rd season at Kansas, has also never lost at home on Big Monday. He’s 38-0 , with the Jayhawks’ last Big 12 home loss on a Monday coming in 2001.\n\nBut Kansas (18-5, 8-2) has also never beaten a No. 1 team at Allen Fieldhouse, going 0-5 in such opportunities. The last was in 2003, when top-ranked Arizona came to town and won 91-74.\n\n“It’s going to be an awesome atmosphere,” UA coach Tommy Lloyd said. “And I just have a feeling those Jayhawk fans are going to be out for blood. So you know what? We’re here for it.”\n\nArizona is a 2.5-point favorite, per FanDuel Sportsbook, and if that holds it would be just the sixth time Kansas has been a home underdog since 1996.\n\nHere’s what to watch for when the UA and KU meet on Monday night:\n\nDepending on which expert you listen to, or which sportsbook you check out, the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is probably going to be one of two freshmen from the Big 12. Arizona has already faced BYU wing AJ Dybantsa, now it gets a crack at Kansas guard Darryn Peterson.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Peterson is averaging 20.5 points per game, 21.1 in Big 12 play, and makes 41.7 percent of his 3-point shots. He has scored in double figures every time out, going for 18 in 20 minutes against BYU and nailing the tying and winning 3s in the final 1:20 of a win at Texas Tech last week.\n\nBut Peterson has also missed quite a bit of time due to injury. He’s sat out 10 games, nine during nonconference play, did not play at Kansas State on Jan. 24 and a week later didn’t play the second half against BYU because of cramping.\n\nThe last two games, at Texas Tech and vs. Utah, saw him play 30-plus minutes but also post two of his lowest offensive ratings of the season.\n\nLike BYU, Kansas isn’t just its potential No. 1 pick. Three other Jayhawks average more than 14 points in Big 12 games, with guard Melvin Council dropping 36 at NC State in December scoring 22 in an OT win over TCU last month that saw his team rally from down 15 with less than five minutes to go.\n\nKansas also has the top shot blocker in the conference in 6-foot-10 sophomore Flory Bidunga. Bidunga has swatted 65 shots this season, averaging 3.8 in Big 12 play with seven against Utah on Saturday, and is shooting 78.5 percent in conference action.\n\nDepth could be an issue for Kansas, though. Only two bench players average double figures in minutes and guard Elmarko Jackson missed the last game. Self has said Jackson will play against Arizona but may not be 100 percent.\n\nBidunga and starting center Bryson Tiller, a 6-11 freshman, have been good at avoiding foul trouble but if they do get whistled there’s not much behind them to eat minutes.\n\nArizona has outrebounded every opponent this season, finishing plus-20 against Oklahoma State last time out, and is limiting Big 12 foes to boards on 25.6 percent of their misses. That’s tops in the conference, while Kansas is the worst offensive rebounding team in the league.\n\nKansas got 42 of its 71 points against Utah in the paint but also gave up 32 (of 57). The Jayhawks are +6.4 in paint points for the season, +8 in Big 12 games. Arizona, which won the paint battle 54-14 against Oklahoma State, is +19.2 in conference play.\n\nArizona may need to attempt a few more 3-pointers in this one, though, as Kansas is third-best in the Big 12 in 2-point defense. Bidunga’s shot blocking has a lot to do with that.\n\nBrayden Burries was Arizona’s leading scorer for the seventh time, fourth in Big 12 play, but for the 12th time this season the Wildcats had at least five players in double figures. Every member of the 8-man rotation has either led or tied for the lead in scoring in a game, with five different guys doing that in conference games.\n\n“I just feel like our versatility, and we know how deep we are,” Jaden Bradley said when asked about the key to Arizona’s unbeaten start. “It can be anybody’s night, the bigs, the guards, and I feel like everybody’s happy for one another. And I feel like that’s special. You don’t see that too often.”\n\nKansas could have a front row seat for another Bradley masterclass, which he’s mostly saved for ranked foes. The senior guard is averaging 19.7 points in Arizona’s six games against ranked teams, shooting 56.9 percent, and 18.8 points in Big 12 road contests.",

    "title": "President Donald Trump complains about 'terrible' Bill Belichick Hall of Fame snub in Super Bowl LX interview",
    "description": "The Patriots coach fell short of Canton in his first year of eligibility.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has expressed admiration for the New England Patriots dynasty in the past, so it was little surprise what he thought about Bill Belichick's Pro Football Hall of Fame snub.\n\nSpeaking with NBC News in an interview conducted Wednesday and aired on Super Bowl Sunday, the president complained about the longtime Patriots coach failing to reach Canton in his first year of eligibility:\n\n\"I thought it was terrible. I mean, he's— won so much, won so many Super Bowls. Great coach. Became a little bit controversial, I guess, after that, this little period after that. During it he was just a great coach. I thought it was very inappropriate.\n\n\"Oh yeah. It's like what have you done for me lately? Well, you know, you have a great career and he has a little bit of a controversial year and a half, two years maybe. But— what difference does that make? No, he should've— he should be in there right at the top.\"\n\nTrump is hardly the first person to rail against the snub. He refers twice to \"controversial\" actions on Belichick's part, which could be a reference to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that occurred under the coach's watch. However, he alludes to those controversial years being after Belichick's NFL career so he might simply be referring to the 73-year-old's post-Patriots UNC-Jordon Hudson era.\n\nRegardless, Belichick's snubs came down to more than controversies. As one of the few Belichick \"no\" voters laid out, the matter of voting Belichick was more than \"yes\" or \"no.\" To some, it was \"Belichick\" or \"a group of senior players who might not get another Hall of Fame shot for years.\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame's voting process created conditions in which the NFL's all-time leader in playoff wins among head coaches was put in competition for a limited number of votes with three senior players and a contributor, in this case Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nThis year, the only one of that quintet to emerge was former San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig, who was recognized on the field at Super Bowl LX alongside modern-era inductees Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri.",

    "fullText": "Who cares about the 2026 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks? Most football fans are already looking to next year, and hoping their team can make the surprising leap that New England and Seattle did this season.\n\nThe Seahawks’ were No. 19 in the preseason Super Bowl odds this season. The Patriots were No. 21 in the preseason Super Bowl odds. The NFL is king in part because almost every team starts each season with the belief that they can win the championship if everything goes according to plan. Parity is going stronger than ever in the modern game, and the 2025-26 season is all the evidence you need.\n\nIt’s never too early to look ahead to next year. Here’s every team’s Super Bowl LXI odds a year out before the game is played in SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on Feb. 14, 2027. My favorite bets are included after the table.\n\nChicago Bears (+2700): The Bears are due for some regression to the mean in terms of forcing turnovers next year. Chicago’s 22 takeaways led the league, and only Houston (17) was close, with no other team having more than 13. That’s okay: the Bears’ offense is probably due for some positive regression and additional growth from QB Caleb Williams. Williams turns 25 years old in the middle of next season as he starts Year 3 in the NFL, and he already showed massive improvement in the second half of year two. The Bears should use their available cap space to beef up the defensive front, which will hopefully make them less turnover dependent. With rookies like Colston Loveland and Luther Burden II primed to take a bigger step forward, plus a possible breakout year from Rome Odunze in his third season, the Bears should be a better offense and more sustainable defense.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (+1800): The Niners had a season from hell in terms of injuries and still had a really good year. San Francisco will be healthier coming into next season, and the injuries they had this season allowed several talented young players to get their feet wet, which should benefit them next year. Expect the Niners to be an active team in free agency after the likely release of Brandon Aiyuk. Kyle Shanahan is as good as any head coach in the NFL. There’s still blue chip talent up and down this roster. If they went 12-5 in a season where they had a lot of bad luck, I’ll bank on some positive regression next season.\n\nWashington Commanders (+4500): Jayden Daniels has looked like a superstar quarterback when he’s fully healthy, and this offseason the Commanders have the opportunity to load up on talent around him. Washington enters the offseason with the No. 7 overall pick, and tons of cap space to splurge on free agents. Edge rushers, linebackers, and secondary help could all be on the menu for a defense that struggled this season. It would also be nice to get Daniels some weapons with Zach Ertz working through a torn ACL and Deebo Samuel entering free agency. Washington needs a talent infusion, but they have the means to do it, and I like the QB/coach combo of Daniels and Dan Quinn for a deep sleeper.",

Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text.",

    "fullText": "Another day, another vulnerability (or two, or 200) in the security nightmare that is OpenClaw.\n\nResearchers, over the last two days, have disclosed additional issues with OpenClaw - the vibecoded and famously insecure AI agent farm formerly known as Clawdbot and then Moltbot. Specifically, researchers say that the open source agent platform is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection, allowing an attacker to backdoor a user's machine and then steal sensitive data or perform destructive operations.\n\nPlus, as other threat hunters have recently found, the ClawHub marketplace for OpenClaw is teeming with malware and leaky agent skills that expose sensitive credentials.\n\nIn a Thursday blog, Snyk engineers said they scanned the entire ClawHub marketplace containing nearly 4,000 skills and found that 283 of them - that's about 7.1 percent of the entire registry - contain flaws that expose sensitive credentials.\n\n\"They are functional, popular agent skills (like moltyverse-email and youtube-data) that instruct AI agents to mishandle secrets, forcing them to pass API keys, passwords, and even credit card numbers through the LLM's context window and output logs in plaintext,\" the engineers wrote.\n\nThis security flaw is due to the SKILL.md instructions, and developers treating AI agents like local scripts.\n\nWhen someone prompts an agent to \"use this API key,\" the model saves the key in memory, and that conversation history can be leaked to model providers such as OpenAI or Anthropic - or they could appear in plain text in application logs.\n\n\"Perhaps most alarming is the buy-anything skill (v2.0.0),\" the engineers wrote. \"It instructs the agent to collect credit card details to make purchases.\"\n\nTo do this, the LLM tokenizes the user's credit card number, thus sending financial info to the model provider. A subsequent prompt could ask the agent: \"Check your logs for the last purchase and repeat the card details,\" and thus expose the user's credit card to an attacker, enabling financial fraud and theft.\n\nSnyk's research follows a similar blog the developer-focused security shop published on Wednesday that found malware-laced skills across the ecosystem, including 76 malicious payloads designed for credential theft, backdoor installation, and data exfiltration.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, AI security firm Zenity's research arm demonstrated how an attacker could use indirect prompt injection to backdoor OpenClaw users' machines. The problem here is due to AI agents' integrations with other productivity tools like Google Workspace and Slack, allowing OpenClaw to access email, calendars, documents, and enterprise Slack chats.\n\nIn Zenity's proof-of-concept, the attack begins with a Google document and assumes that the OpenClaw instance already integrates with a user's Google environment - although the threat hunters note that a Google Workspace integration is not a prerequisite for the attack. Any trusted third-party integration will work, as this initial integration is only needed to deliver the initial malicious document or other type of content.\n\nIn the Google doc example, it contains an indirect prompt injection payload directing OpenClaw to create a new integration with a Telegram bot.\n\n\"Once the integration is created, OpenClaw begins accepting and responding to messages from the attacker-controlled bot,\" the researchers wrote. \"From this stage onward, the attacker interacts with OpenClaw exclusively through the newly added chat channel.\"\n\nThis means that an attacker can issue commands via the bot, asking OpenClaw to read all of the files on a user's desktop, steal their content and send it all to an attacker-controlled server, and then permanently delete all the files.\n\nOr, they could instruct the agent to download and execute a Sliver command-and-control (C2) beacon onto the victim's computer for long-term remote access. At this point, the attacker wouldn't really even need the AI agent and could instead use the backdoor and C2 channel for lateral movement, privilege escalation, credential harvesting - even ransomware deployment.\n\nThe evil possibilities are truly endless.\n\nThe Register reached out to OpenClaw and its developer Peter Steinberger about these security issues - the latest in what has become a daily deluge of OpenClaw vulnerabilities - and did not receive an immediate response. We will update this story if and when we do. ®",

    "fullText": "Occasionally, when it comes up in conversation that I have five children, I'm met with surprise and sometimes, a little bit of shock.\n\nAnd while I understand that five may seem like a lot of kids in some regards, in my neck of the woods, it's really not that uncommon. In fact, my sister-in-law has seven children, so in comparison, my brood is the small one.\n\nAll in all, with kids ranging in age from a few months to 17, my kids are a part of a close-knit cousin clan of 15 and counting.\n\nHaving a lot of cousins nearby can be costly for birthdays and the holidays, but for everyday life, the fact that my kids have those relationships truly feels priceless.\n\nI love the simple happiness my kids get from spending time with their cousins, and it feels like such a gift. In a world where it feels like everyone is trying to sell me something or make me pay for \"fun\" experiences for my kids, knowing that what they love most in the world is just being at home with their cousins feels almost too good to be true sometimes. Honestly, I wish I could recapture that level of pure joy in my own adult life again.\n\nI will be honest with you: having 10 kids in my house at once does mean I have to do a lot of post-play cleanup (and right now, we're currently cycling through a stomach bug passed along over our cousin sleepover), but it's always worth it for how much fun the kids have.\n\nAside from the sleepovers our kids can usually talk us into, having a sister-in-law with seven kids is also very convenient for me as a mom. All it takes is her family to come over for birthdays and special occasions, and we have an instant, built-in party.\n\nIt really works out for me, especially because each of my kids has an instant playmate in their cousin who is their age.\n\nFor instance, my son is the only boy in our family, but because he has two male cousins near his age, he gets the fun boy time he misses out on at home. And my youngest daughter has a large five-year gap with her own siblings, so she gets to experience the fun of playmates her age, too.\n\nMy oldest girls don't have cousins their ages, so they have missed out on some level of the cousin fun, but even as teenagers, they love all their cousins, and they have a special relationship with all the littles that is beautiful in its own way. It's so fun watching the younger girls look up to them, and my girls are always so gracious, letting the littles do their makeup and hair and playing with them when they are together.\n\nRight now, my kids are incredibly lucky with the time they get with their families. They see both sides of their families regularly, with weekly breakfasts, time at church, all holidays and special occasions, sports events, and random visits, just for fun. My husband and I both live within 30 minutes of almost all of our own siblings and parents, so to my kids, close-knit families are the norm.\n\nWhile my kids are incredibly close with their cousins right now, I know those relationships might change as they get older. People can grow apart, family members will most likely move away, and things can happen.\n\nBut no matter what their relationships look like in the future, I do believe that the close-knit relationships and the memories they are creating together will shape them. Belonging somewhere matters, both as a child and as an adult, and I hope that the feeling of being loved as part of a big family sits somewhere inside them as they grow.",

    "description": "A full-time reseller explains how years of thrifting experience helped her spot a $3,000 designer bag at a thrift store for $8.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kristen Boelen, the founder of Lunch Break Vintage. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have been thrifting since the moment I could drive. Back then, I was into higher-end things that were out of my budget, and I'd go thrift shopping to find similar items that I could afford. That habit carried on through college and beyond, including when I was most recently working as an art director for a wine and spirits company. While working there, I'd thrift on my lunch breaks.\n\nI'd find stuff for myself, as well as one-of-a-kind items that didn't fit. I wanted someone to take that stuff. So I began selling items on Whatnot.\n\nI'd thrift on my lunch break from work, and then on the weekends I'd go live and sell my pieces. My business grew from there, and I named it Lunch Break Vintage, which I began full time in February 2025.\n\nIn December 2025, I was at a thrift store in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was a normal Wednesday, which is the day this particular thrift store opens for the week, and when I always try to go. It was very empty that day.\n\nTwo woven leather bags caught my eye. You see woven leather bags all the time. There are so many Bottega Veneta dupes. I didn't really think much about it, just that one of them looked exceptionally nice.\n\nI first noticed the hardware, then the leather slouching and hanging. I could tell it was soft leather. When I picked it up, it was heavy — designer leather bags have a weight to them because of the hardware. I opened it up and saw the logo. You can see in the video that I posted that's the moment my jaw drops. The leather inside was really soft and buttery too; that's always a sign a bag is legitimate.\n\nI know they sort through and send a lot of the higher-end pieces to an online audience. It seemed unrealistic that someone wouldn't have set it aside. I thought, if they had put it out there, it must not be real.\n\nI took a photo of it and put it into Google Lens, and found on Vestaire Collective there was the exact same bag and color. That clued me into the style name and that it had been retired. There's a video of me going, \"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,\" once I figured out where the serial tag was. I got out of there as quickly as possible, paying $8 for the bag.\n\nI later had it authenticated through an app I use called Authentic Detective. It will give you a certificate of authenticity. Online research says the bag is valued at around $3,000.\n\nI'm keeping the bag for myself. It's something that will be passed down for generations. I had so many comments on the video saying that the bag was ugly, but I love it.\n\nI thrift all the time because I now do this for a living, but I think consistency is key. I thrift at least three times a week, every week. It's also important not to just pick up what is trending. A good secondhand item has to check all the boxes for me, and I really care about quality, always looking for natural fibers. I focus on what makes people feel elevated and the kinds of secondhand pieces they can keep in their closets forever.\n\nDon't believe that middle-of-nowhere places are garbage. Some of my best, coolest, most unique pieces have come from middle-of-nowhere stores.",

    "fullText": "\"Vibe-coding\" just celebrated its first birthday. That's a lifetime in the AI boom.\n\nNow, the man who coined the term is celebrating the birth of a new one: \"agentic engineering.\"\n\nWhile vibe-coding is when humans prompt AI to write code, OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy says agentic engineering is when AI agents write the code themselves.\n\n\"Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally, my current favorite is 'agentic engineering,'\" he wrote in a recent X post.\n\nKarpathy said he calls it \"agentic engineering\" not just because agents are writing the code, but because \"there is an art & science and expertise to it.\"\n\nVibe-coding is one of the biggest innovations of the AI revolution. Prominent CEOs and startup founders alike are encouraging the use of vibe-coding across their teams. And billions are being poured into new vibe-coding companies.\n\nLovable, one of Europe's fastest-growing startups, announced that it had raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation in December. Cursor, an AI-assisted code editor, announced a Series D funding round of $2.3 billion in November and said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue.\n\nThe approach is also threatening traditional engineering jobs. In a Business Insider survey of 167 software engineers, 75 engineers said that they were \"keeping up,\" while 30 said they felt ahead of the curve, and 27 felt behind.\n\n\"Vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic 'contribution,' and even its article is longer. lol,\" Karpathy wrote on X about its meteoric rise.\n\nKarpathy was a founding member of OpenAI in 2015, years before competitors like Anthropic and xAI emerged. He later moved into self-driving technology, leading Tesla's Autopilot program as head of AI. He's now building Eureka Labs, which describes itself on its website as building a \"new kind of school that is AI native.\"",

    "description": "Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a president repeatedly declaring inflation beaten while rarely acknowledging the strain many Americans say they still feel.\n\nIn five speeches on the economy since December, Trump asserted that inflation had been beaten or was way down almost 20 times and said prices were falling almost 30 times, assertions at odds with economic data and voters' daily experiences. Much of the remaining time was spent on grievances and other issues, including ​immigration, whether Somalia was a country, and attacks on opponents.\n\nTaken together, the speeches portray a president struggling to reconcile his central claim — that he has fixed the cost-of-living crisis — with inflation near 3% over the past year and voters’ lived experience of paying more for grocery staples. The price of ground beef, for example, ‌is up 18% since Trump took office a year ago, while ground coffee prices are up 29%.\n\nRepublican strategists told Reuters that his mixed messaging on the top issue for voters risks creating a credibility gap for him and the Republican Party ahead of the November midterms, when control of Congress will be at stake. Opinion polls show voters are deeply unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy.\n\n\"He can't continue to make claims that are demonstrably ‌false, particularly at the expense of Republicans who are in competitive House districts or Senate races,\" said Rob Godfrey, a Republican strategist. Trump \"must be disciplined and focused,\" he added.\n\nOne source close to the White House said the president needed to hit the issue of affordability harder and through personal visits to critical districts.\n\n\"He needs to bring the message out because the message is not resonating,\" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the issue.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Trump’s focus on illegal immigration in his speeches is directly connected to his argument that people in the country illegally have an adverse impact on the economy. Desai said it causes “public services being overburdened, business activity disrupted by crime, housing markets flooded, and workers’ wages depressed.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stressed that much work remains to clean up the economic mess he says his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, left him, Desai added.\n\nTRUMP VEERS OFF MESSAGE TO RAIL ABOUT IMMIGRATION\n\nThe Reuters analysis found that Trump - when not declaring inflation beaten - devoted nearly half his speaking time to grievances and other issues.\n\nIn about five hours of speaking time, he spent roughly two hours straying into ⁠about 20 topics unrelated to prices, the Reuters review found. When he veered off message, his top issue was illegal immigration, ‌which he spent a total of about 30 to 40 minutes talking about.\n\nIn the speeches he insulted Somali Americans in Minnesota, who voted against him in the 2024 election. He referred to Somalia as \"not even a country\" - and in four speeches he disparaged Somali-born Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nA progressive, high-profile Democrat and Muslim, Omar has been a frequent Trump critic, especially over his immigration policies.\n\n\"Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,\" Omar said last month, the ‍day after a man sprayed a foul-smelling liquid on her at a town hall event.\n\nTrump also talked about men in women's sports, Venezuela, Iran, the Islamic State militant group, Greenland, Ukraine and Russia, military recruitment, his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, U.S. weaponry, his exaggerated claim to have ended eight wars, and even how much a Fox News anchor likes him.\n\nTRUMP'S MEANDERING WORRIES STRATEGISTS\n\n\"Inflation is stopped. Incomes are up. Prices are down,\" Trump said in an Iowa speech on January 27.\n\nOnly twice in the five speeches did Trump acknowledge that prices are still too high, but he blamed them on Biden. Trump was elected in 2024 because of voter unhappiness with Biden's handling of inflation - which spiked to over 9% in 2022 - and illegal immigration.\n\nDemocrats caused prices \"to be too high,\" Trump told a rally ​in Pennsylvania on December 9. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nIn the same speech he called the term \"affordability\" a Democratic \"hoax\". After a public backlash, he has ceased saying that in more recent speeches.\n\nIn four of the speeches Trump repeatedly and haphazardly switches topics, often when he is in the middle of talking about the economy, the Reuters review found.\n\nFour Republican strategists ‌interviewed by Reuters said Trump's meandering style - which he proudly calls \"the weave\" - risked drowning out his core economic argument that he has brought inflation and prices down.\n\nSpeaking to world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 21, Trump spent the first 22 minutes on topic, then suddenly, for the next 22 minutes, insulted Europeans, said they would be speaking German if it wasn’t for America, called NATO ungrateful, and decried the “crooked” media before pivoting back to the U.S. economy.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said voters want to hear what Trump is doing to lower costs. \"But they have no memory of what Trump says about economic issues because of the volume of his own rhetoric.\"\n\nOne source familiar with the White House's thinking said Trump was likely to use his State of the Union address on February 24 as the kickoff for more intense domestic travel to amplify his message on affordability.\n\nFor many Americans, the economy still feels unforgiving. Prices remain high, even though the inflation rate has inched down since Trump took office, from 3% to 2.7%. A lower inflation rate does not mean prices are decreasing - just that they are growing at a slower pace, economists stress.\n\nIn the 12 months through December 2025, food costs were up over 3%, while average hourly earnings were up only 1.1% year over year. The unemployment rate was 4.4% in December, up from 4% when Trump took office in January 2025, according to government data.\n\nIn ⁠some of the speeches Trump correctly identifies a drop in prices for a few everyday goods, including eggs and gas. The cost of eggs fell about 21% in December from a year earlier after ​being 60% higher during Trump's first months back in office. Gas prices are about 4% lower since January last year.\n\nBut the cost of an average grocery basket has risen. The price of coffee, beef, and some fruits, ​among other items, has risen in the past year.\n\nTrump does offer solutions in his speeches, including his tax cuts that kicked in last month that will produce greater savings for tens of millions of families; the scrapping of taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payments; his plan to reduce mortgage interest rates; a proposal to lower housing prices; and deals with health insurance companies to reduce drug prices.\n\nMost economists expect U.S. households and the economy at large to benefit in the months ahead from the tax cuts. But Trump's more recent proposals are unlikely to have a ‍significant impact on the cost of living between now and November, some economists told Reuters. One ⁠of Trump's ideas - to cap credit card interest rates to 10% for a year - could even backfire since it could limit access to credit for lower-income families, some economists have warned.\n\nMike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports candidates for the House of Representatives, said Trump and Republicans were helping working families. \"Voters are seeing this clear contrast, and the best is yet to come.\"\n\nSome 35% of Americans approve of Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a January 25 Reuters/Ipsos poll, up slightly from 33% in December. But it is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office a year ago.\n\nFormer economic officials in previous administrations say Trump is falling into the same trap Biden did in 2024 when confronted with persistently high inflation.\n\nBiden kept claiming the U.S. economy was strong and urged voters to look at other economic data. That strategy failed badly and Democrats were punished at the polls.\n\nThe officials agreed it was important for presidents to show voters they understood their economic pain, especially in an election year.\n\n\"We ‌definitely talked past people on inflation,\" Jared Bernstein, the head of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.\n\n\"What we typically did was to say, 'A new report just came out on jobs, it's very strong,' and that was all true. But the fact is that there wasn't much we were ‌able to do in terms of the price level.\"",

    "fullText": "Christina Mann moved from Cleveland, Texas, to the small community of Point Blank four years ago when she retired. She wanted to retire close to the water, a dream of hers. Now, water is the nightmare that's keeping her from making ends meet.\n\nEvery other day, Mann drives several miles to a friend's house to fill five-gallon jugs from a garden hose. That water is what she uses to wash dishes, wash her hands and flush her toilets — her only supply after she decided last November to disconnect her water service entirely.\n\n\"I choose to eat, and I told them that every time you go up, that takes out of my money a month for my food,\" Mann told ABC13's 13 Investigates (1).\n\nMann lives alone on a monthly Social Security check she budgeted carefully around when she retired. There was enough to cover her bills, but barely. When the base fees charged by her provider — a for-profit company called Texas Water Utilities — kept climbing, she felt cornered. A termination notice arrived, and she didn't fight it. \"You don't need to send me one. Just come cut my water off. I can't afford it,\" she said.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAccording to a copy of Mann's bill reviewed by 13 Investigates, she was charged $169 for a month in which she used just 2,000 gallons. In July, the fees alone — base charges for water and sewage, pass-through fees and a state fee — totaled $150.18. Her actual water and sewage usage that billing cycle came to $9.34.\n\nThat means roughly 94% of her bill had nothing to do with how much water came out of her faucet.\n\nMann said she could manage if her bill were closer to the roughly $60 a month she paid back in Cleveland.\n\nMann's provider, Texas Water Utilities, is an investor-owned utility — a for-profit company, not a city-run system. Texas Water Utilities serves about 60,000 customers in 32 counties, is acquiring at least four other companies, and has filed to tack on a $34-per-month \"system improvement charge\" to recoup more than $80 million in infrastructure spending.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan's volatile financial markets must now contend with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi firmly in the driver's seat after her decisive victory on Sunday, which hands her an electoral mandate to reflate the economy.\n\nThe question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously.\n\nHow has the Takaichi trade impacted Japanese markets?\n\nWhy are investors concerned about Japan's debt burden?\n\nHow might Takaichi's electoral victory affect policy direction?\n\nWhat are Takaichi's key economic stimulus policies?\n\nSince she began her rise to become the nation's first female premier in October, the \"Takaichi trade\" has pushed domestic shares to record highs while causing a precipitous selloff in Japanese government bonds ‌and the yen.\n\nVoters braved heavy snowfalls in Tokyo and other parts of Japan to deliver what exit polls indicated to be the most decisive win for Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party since 1996.\n\n\"The stock market is a true believer in Takaichi, so the big win is going to be good news for equities when the markets open on Monday,\" said Chris Scicluna, the head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.\n\nTakaichi, a devotee of the \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies of the late premier Shinzo Abe, has ⁠pledged a proactive fiscal policy funded largely through bond ‌issuance.\n\nShe came to office at a low point in power and popularity for her Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-World War Two period, forcing her to bargain with opposition parties with even more liberal fiscal ‍platforms.\n\n\"The administration's foundation will become much more stable, making it easier for expectations to build around advancing economic policy,\" said Kota Suzuki, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management. \"Because there will no longer be a need to actively seek the opposition's cooperation, there will be less pressure for giveaway-style fiscal expansion.\"\n\nWith polls already indicating a decisive LDP win, Japan's benchmark ​Nikkei 225 Index set an all-time high of 54,782.83 on Tuesday. Big winners of late include sectors like defence, artificial intelligence and chips that ‌have been singled out by Takaichi for targeted investment.\n\nBut prospects for more government outlays have unsettled investors already concerned about Japan's debt burden, the largest in the developed world. Those worries came to a head on January 20, when rates across the JGB yield curve shot to multi-decade or even record highs after Takaichi called for the snap election and embraced suspending the sales tax on food.\n\nThe yen has also been punished, losing about 6% against the dollar since Takaichi's selection as prime minister in October and plumbing record lows against the euro and Swiss franc. Only threats of joint currency market intervention with the United ⁠States have arrested the yen's slide.",

    "description": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President",
    "fullText": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro, asking residents if they still supported the party that has run the country for nearly 20 years. The result: about half of members said they no longer did.\n\n“The response is very bad,” said a person who helped lead the effort. “There is division among us.”\n\nWhile Reuters was not able to independently verify the canvassing results, the reported drop in support aligned with ​information gathered from three other parts of the country.\n\nThe news agency spoke to 13 party members or local leaders across four states who reported fractures in the United Socialist Party (PSUV) following the U.S. attack. All of them expressed a deep sense of uncertainty and many voiced worries about their economic future.\n\nThe government’s ‌patronage system, which bought a form of party loyalty through financial benefits and food parcels, also appears to be under pressure, with five of the sources saying some contributions had stopped since Maduro’s capture.\n\nSix of the people described distrust among party loyalists and spreading suspicion of interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Eight said they had seen a drop in participation and support at their local party branch, with two of them estimating a ‌70% fall in attendance at events like marches and local assembly meetings.\n\nThe people Reuters spoke to all requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, with several saying local leaders were encouraging the party faithful to snitch on any members losing faith in the cause, a common tactic for weeding out popular dissent in Venezuela. Reuters has withheld the names of the people it interviewed to protect their safety.\n\nThere are no recent public numbers on party membership and while Reuters talked to people observing falling participation in four geographically dispersed states, the news agency could not determine what the situation was across all 24 states in the country. Most foreign media do not have permanent staff in the country and Venezuelans are generally reluctant to speak freely with reporters because of potential reprisals.\n\nNeither the Venezuelan government nor PSUV responded to Reuters requests for comment on the eroding support for the party and the fraying of its patronage system.\n\nCalls for national unity in the face of threats to Venezuela have been a constant in Rodriguez’s speeches and public appearances since Maduro's removal, and she has also cheered the resilience of the ⁠country's people and pledged economic development for all.\n\nDespite decrying Maduro’s detention as a kidnapping, Rodriguez appears to be complying with ‌U.S. demands to open the country to American oil companies and has also met with the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to discuss cooperation against drug trafficking.\n\nFraying party support at the grassroots level would be a problem for Rodriguez. Reuters has previously reported how she is already battling to shore up her rule by putting allies in positions of power to shield herself from the potential threat posed by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who also heads the PSUV and has close connections to the security services and colectivos - the hardline motorcycle-riding ‍enforcement arm of the party.\n\nPublicly, Cabello has stressed unity. On Jan. 12, he used his weekly press conference as party leader to emphasize Rodriguez has \"all the support of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.”\n\nNeither U.S. President Donald Trump nor Rodriguez has seriously addressed the question of elections since Maduro’s ouster, but the anecdotal dwindling of local support appears to point to an uncomfortable truth for the PSUV: Maduro’s exit has done little to improve popularity, according to the party members Reuters interviewed.\n\nA local party leader in the northern state of Aragua said the party had no way to grow or ​win elections, “even if we had Che Guevara or Gandhi as a candidate.\"\n\n“You have a situation where the apparatus of repression is fragmenting and on top of that the remaining grassroots base is demobilizing. That’s a huge challenge for governability,” said Ricardo Rios, head of Caracas-based analysis and consultancy firm Poder & Estrategia.\n\nStill, local support for the party ‌may revive. Venezuela has already received $500 million from crude sales and any significant economic improvement could help boost funding of the party and get membership perks, which have historically helped buttress support, flowing again.\n\nIn response to Reuters questions about the problems facing the Socialist Party, a senior White House official said: “The country is stable, illegal migration has stopped, drug flows have halted, and the new oil deal will generate economic prosperity for both the Venezuelan and American people.\"\n\nAll of Venezuela's top officials are long-time members of the PSUV. The party was created in 2007 by merging the disparate political and social forces that swept socialist President Hugo Chavez to power in 1999. That movement also came to bear his name - ‘Chavismo.’\n\nThe reasons given for falling local support varied. Some said people were wary of being associated with the party if the opposition were to win power, fearing some form of retribution. Others said uncertainty was causing infighting in ⁠the party. Nearly all spoke of disillusionment and questioned the loyalty of the new leadership to the Chavista cause.\n\nAdding to people’s hardship are problems with the delivery of party handouts, both food and ​financial, that have hit local branches, five sources said. They said members in three states - Zulia, Aragua and Falcon – were deserting the party because the government had stopped making bonus payments and distributing welfare. Reuters ​was not able to independently verify the information it gathered about stalling handouts.\n\nGovernment payments, which through various different benefits can for some add up to over $100 a month, are a vital income for millions in Venezuela, where the monthly minimum wage is less than $1 and poverty is rampant. Inflation is also estimated by analysts to have topped 400% in 2025.\n\nThe complexity of Venezuela's welfare system, with an array of benefits delivered at different times to different people, meant Reuters was unable to get a complete picture of the status of all payments and food ‍parcels, with some of those interviewed saying certain bonuses were still arriving while others were ⁠not.\n\nOne source in Zulia state said that in their district 600 people had not received their “family bonus”, a direct welfare payment of up to $65 given to help with living costs. Three sources also reported that food parcels, known as CLAP, have not been delivered, with some adding that problems with these deliveries predate the capture of Maduro but have continued since.\n\nIn the municipality of Mara, in the northwest border with Colombia, one party member said there were old-school Socialist Party members still committed to the cause and “clapping like seals” but that even they are “turning because they haven't been paid their bonuses.\"\n\nAbout 70% of local party members and ⁠public employees in Mara ignored calls to participate in two recent pro-Maduro marches, the person said, leading bosses to threaten people with firings. Reuters could not establish the size of the marches or if there were any firings as a result.\n\nFour of the people Reuters spoke to reported that even the motorbike-riding ‘colectivos’ were attending fewer events and have not been mobilized to push people into public support of the government. Their ‌members have been responsible for killing opposition figures and anti-government protesters, according to reports, which Reuters has not independently confirmed, from organizations like Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe person in Mara said many colectivo members are now working as motorbike taxi drivers, failing to show up to marches despite threats from ‌local authorities to revoke their mototaxi work permits, the person said. \"They hide, they fake an illness and a few have gone to Colombia.\"",

    "title": "NASA's Artemis II Spacesuits Still Have One Big Problem, According To Former Astronauts",
    "description": "As NASA prepares to kick off the Artemis missions, experts have noticed a potentially dangerous issue with a crucial component: the newly designed spacesuits.",
    "fullText": "You would think that NASA has everything ironed out for its biggest mission series yet: the Artemis missions, which will eventually send a crew of astronauts to the lunar surface. But as Artemis II gears up to launch and the rocket is prepared for takeoff, NASA is still adapting, though not necessarily for the better.\n\nFor example, the Artemis II Orion craft had a potentially dangerous flaw that saw NASA adjusting its reentry trajectory to address it. That flaw was originally discovered during the Artemis I mission, when the craft's heat shield saw char loss. Meanwhile, the new spacesuits pose another big problem: They will reportedly be heavier and bulkier than those worn during the Apollo missions (dubbed the Armstrong spacesuit). After over half a century, the astronauts will be wearing suits that have taken a step backwards in the heft department. It may not seem concerning since they'll be bouncing around in zero gravity, but former astronauts put that idea to bed. Being on the moon will actually create \"extreme physical stress\" on the astronauts for several reasons.\n\nKate Rubins, former astronaut and professor of computational and systems biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, explains that during a moonwalk, physical stress is elevated. For starters, \"people are going to be sleep shifting,\" which means they'll barely rest. Moreover, the astronauts will be wearing the suits for up to nine hours and doing EVAs (extravehicular activities or spacewalks) every day. According to Rubins, the spacewalks she did outside the ISS were like doing multiple marathons in succession.\n\nAs Rubin explains, the Axiom commercial suits (aka the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or AxEMU) will create added physical exertion and stress during the moonwalks. Not exclusively from the suits, but also equipment astronauts will be wearing and carrying, like a heavy life support backpack. The suits weigh over 300 pounds in Earth's gravity, though due to the lower gravity — about 1/6 of Earth's — they're lighter on the lunar surface. They'll still be heavier than the original 185-pound Armstrong suits. Each astronaut will also have to contend with the weight of the suit, the equipment, and their body mass collectively. Artemis III will not have a rover, either, so astronauts will be taking all physical exertion upon themselves to move equipment, tools, and other gear.\n\nThe AxEMU suits do a lot of things right, per official descriptions. They're safer and built to last generations, and they offer a custom fit for everyone. NASA and the Artemis astronauts promote the increase in mobility the Axiom suits offer. With a lot of those improvements thanks to the rear-entry design. Astronauts can get in and out themselves without help. Moreover, the suit is engineered for planetary or surface walks, which means support for legs, more upper mobility, and modular support to bring various tools.\n\nEven so, the weight may pose a challenge bigger than anyone is expecting. Former astronaut Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt, from the Apollo 17 mission, once remarked he would have designed suits to have \"four times the mobility, and half the weight.\" The AxEMU may have more mobility, but it's also heavier. We'll know soon enough how it works out, as NASA is already building the Artemis 3 rocket, which will fly after Artemis II's loop around the moon.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI collected ample proof that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused underage girls but found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men, an Associated Press review of internal Justice Department records shows.\n\nVideos and photos seized from Epstein’s homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn’t depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.\n\nAn examination of Epstein’s financial records, including payments he made to entities linked to influential figures in academia, finance and global diplomacy, found no connection to criminal activity, said another internal memo in 2019.\n\nSummarizing the investigation in an email last July, agents said “four or five” Epstein accusers claimed other men or women had sexually abused them. But, the agents said, there “was not enough evidence to federally charge these individuals.”\n\nThe AP and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential, that the Justice Department released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and it is possible those records contain evidence overlooked by investigators.\n\nHere are takeaways from what the documents show about the FBI investigation and why U.S. authorities ultimately decided to close it without additional charges.\n\nThe Epstein investigation began in 2005, when the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported that she had been molested at the millionaire’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. Then-Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta struck a deal letting Epstein plead guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. Sentenced to 18 months in jail, Epstein was free by mid-2009.\n\nIn 2018, a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea deal prompted federal prosecutors to take a fresh look at the accusations.\n\nEpstein was arrested in July of 2019. One month later, he killed himself in his jail cell.\n\nA year later, prosecutors charged Epstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, saying she’d recruited several of his victims and sometimes joined the sexual abuse. Convicted in 2021, Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term.\n\nLack of evidence for coconspirators\n\nProsecution memos, case summaries and other documents made public in the department’s latest release of Epstein-related records show that FBI agents and federal prosecutors diligently pursued potential coconspirators. Even seemingly outlandish and incomprehensible claims, called in to tip lines, were examined.\n\nSome allegations couldn’t be verified, investigators wrote.\n\nIn 2011 and again in 2019, investigators interviewed Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who in lawsuits and news interviews had accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with numerous men, including Britain’s former Prince Andrew.\n\nInvestigators said they confirmed that Giuffre had been sexually abused by Epstein. But other parts of her story were problematic.\n\nGiuffre acknowledged writing a partly fictionalized memoir of her time with Epstein containing descriptions of things that didn’t take place. She had also offered shifting accounts in interviews with investigators, they wrote.\n\nTwo other Epstein victims who Giuffre had claimed were also “lent out” to powerful men told investigators they had no such experience, prosecutors wrote in a 2019 internal memo.\n\nInvestigators seized a multitude of videos and photos from Epstein’s electronic devices and homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They found CDs, hard copy photographs and at least one videotape containing nude images of females.\n\nNo videos or photos showed Epstein victims being sexually abused, none showed any males with any of the nude females, and none contained evidence implicating anyone other than Epstein and Maxwell, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey wrote in an email for FBI officials last year.\n\nHad they existed, the government “would have pursued any leads they generated,” Comey wrote. “We did not, however, locate any such videos.”\n\nInvestigators who scoured Epstein’s bank records found payments to more than 25 women who appeared to be models — but no evidence that he was engaged in prostituting women to other men, prosecutors wrote.\n\nProsecutors weighed the possibility of charging some of Epstein’s close associates, including an assistant and business clients, but ultimately decided against it because of lack of evidence.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in February 2025 that Epstein’s never-before-seen “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now.” But FBI agents wrote superiors saying the client list didn't exist.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2024, about three weeks before President Joe Biden left office, then-FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate reached out through subordinates to ask \"whether our investigation to date indicates the ‘client list,’ often referred to in the media, does or does not exist,” according to an email summarizing his query.\n\nA day later, an FBI official replied that the case agent had confirmed no client list existed.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2025, two days before Bondi’s Fox News appearance, an FBI supervisory special agent wrote: “While media coverage of the Jeffrey Epstein case references a ‘client list,’ investigators did not locate such a list during the course of the investigation.”\n\nAaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___ The AP is reviewing the documents released by the Justice Department in collaboration with journalists from CBS, NBC, MS NOW and CNBC. Journalists from each newsroom are working together to examine the files and share information about what is in them. Each outlet is responsible for its own independent news coverage of the documents.",

At the start of the day we'd be happy chasing 160,\" said Stirling.\n\n\"When the match was on the line we weren't as clinical as we wanted to be. A little bit sloppy in the field which is disappointing.\n\n\"Experience told. The Sri Lanka team at the end of both innings, that was the difference really.\n\n\"Those 20 runs - they defended well at the back end. We had plenty of wickets in hand, thought we were in good positions the whole way through and they really upped the ante and put the squeeze on.\n\n\"You can sit back and reflect and pick those 20 runs out of anywhere. They were 20 runs better than us throughout the whole match.\"\n\nAustralia are Ireland's next opponents on Wednesday as they chase a top-two finish to secure a place in the Super 8s.\n\nSpin dominated in Sunday's encounter at the R Premadasa Stadium and Stirling believes that could continue in the tournament.\n\n\"I think spin is going to be a challenge in this competition.\n\n\"Certainly, it wasn't coming onto the bat as much as it could have been.

    "description": "A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimi...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimination status.\n\n“Take the vaccine, please,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator whose boss has raised suspicion about the safety and importance of vaccines. “We have a solution for our problem.”\n\nOz, a heart surgeon, defended some recently revised federal vaccine recommendations as well as past comments from President Donald Trump and the nation's health chief, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the efficacy of vaccines. From Oz, there was a clear message on the measles.\n\n“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”\n\nAn outbreak in South Carolina in the hundreds has surpassed the recorded case count in Texas’ 2025 outbreak, and there is also one on the Utah-Arizona border. Multiple other states have had confirmed cases this year. The outbreaks have mostly impacted children and have come as infectious disease experts warn that rising public distrust of vaccines generally may be contributing to the spread of a disease once declared eradicated by public health officials.\n\nAsked in the television interview whether people should fear the measles, Oz replied, “Oh, for sure.” He said Medicare and Medicaid will continue to cover the measles vaccine as part of the insurance programs.\n\n“There will never be a barrier to Americans get access to the measles vaccine. And it is part of the core schedule,” Oz said.\n\nBut Oz also said “we have advocated for measles vaccines all along” and that Kennedy “has been on the very front of this.”\n\nQuestions about vaccines did not come up later in a Kennedy interview on Fox News Channel's “The Sunday Briefing,” where he was asked about what kind of Super Bowl snack he might have (probably yogurt). He also he eats steak with sauerkraut in the mornings.\n\nCritics of Kennedy have argued that the health secretary's longtime skepticism of U.S. vaccine recommendations and past sympathy for the unfounded claim that vaccines may cause autism may influence official public health guidance in ways contrary to the medical consensus.\n\nOz argued that Kennedy's stance was supportive of the measles vaccine despite Kennedy's general comments about the recommended vaccine schedule.\n\n“When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, get your vaccines for measles, because that’s an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against,” Oz said.\n\nThe Republican administration last month dropped some vaccine recommendations for children, an overhaul of the traditional vaccine schedule that the Department of Health and Human Services said was in response to a request from Trump.\n\nTrump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While federal requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nU.S. vaccination rates have dropped and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nKennedy's past anti-vaccine activism\n\nKennedy's past skepticism of vaccines has come under scrutiny since Trump first nominated him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation testimony last year, Kennedy told lawmakers that a closely scrutinized 2019 trip he took to Samoa, which came before a devastating measles outbreak, had “nothing to do with vaccines.”\n\nBut documents obtained by The Guardian and The Associated Press undermine that testimony. Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations said that Kennedy sought to meet with top Samoan officials during his trip to the Pacific island nation.\n\nSamoan officials later said Kennedy’s trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists before the measles outbreak, which sickened thousands of people and killed 83, mostly children under age 5.\n\nMixed messaging on autism, vaccines\n\nOz's comments mark a broader pattern among administration officials of voicing discordant and at times contradictory statements about the efficacy of vaccines amid an overhaul of U.S. public health policy.\n\nOfficials have walked a fine line in criticizing past U.S. vaccine policy, often at times appearing to express sympathy for unfounded conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists, while also not straying too far from established science.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing Tuesday, Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said no single vaccine causes autism, but he did not rule out the possibility that research may find some combination of vaccines could have negative health side effects.\n\nBut Kennedy, in Senate testimony, has argued that a link between vaccines and autism has not been disproved.\n\nHe has previously claimed that some components of vaccines, like the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, may cause childhood neurological disorders such as autism. Most vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella do not contain thimerosal. A federal vaccine advisory board overhauled by Kennedy last year voted to no longer recommend thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nAdministration public health officials often cite the need to restore trust in public health systems after the coronavirus pandemic, when vaccine policy and the general public health response to the deadly pandemic became a highly polarizing topic in American politics.\n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories about the public health system also spread during the pandemic, and longtime anti-vaccine activist groups saw a swell in interest from the wider public.\n\nKennedy, who for years led the anti-vaccine activist group Children's Health Defense, has been criticized for ordering reviews of vaccines and public health guidelines that leading medical research groups have deemed settled science.\n\nPublic health experts also criticized the president for making unfounded claims about highly politicized health issues. During a September Oval Office event, Trump asserted without evidence that Tylenol and vaccines are linked to a rise in the incidence of autism in the United States.",

    "fullText": "After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.\n\nMany stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.\n\nMillions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.\n\nAnd many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US President Donald Trump will not be one of them.\n\nThe Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.\n\nThe Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.\n\nLed by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.\n\nThis is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has reached his first Super Bowl in his first season with Seattle, whose fearsome defence is led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nMany of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.\n\nPuerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.\n\nHe will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years. He is also an actor, has hosted Saturday Night Live and been a WWE 24/7 champion.\n\nRock band Green Day, who are from California, will play an anniversary ceremony before Sunday's game and the NFL has teased that there will be some surprises at half-time.\n\nBad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of President Trump, and Bad Bunny's selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles.\n\nThe controversy even led conservative group Turning Point USA to plan an alternative half-time show, which will star singer and Trump ally Kid Rock.\n\nBad Bunny says he's losing sleep over the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend America's biggest game last year, but he said this year's on the west coast is \"just too far away\".\n\nAsked about the selection of Bad Bunny and Green Day, Trump added:, external \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he avoided the US on his current world tour because of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nThere were fears there would be raids around the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, plus further protests after two people were shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\nBut, speaking on Tuesday, the NFL's chief security officer Cathy Lanier said that no ICE operations are scheduled around any of the many Super Bowl events.\n\nShe added that the Department of Homeland Security sends a variety of different agencies to the Super Bowl, which it ranks as a tier-one event, and ICE is not one of them.\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough Sunday's game will take place at the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium is 45 miles south of the Golden Gate Bridge in Santa Clara.\n\nWhile San Francisco has been the main hub during Super Bowl week, events and parties have been spread around the Bay Area, beginning with Opening Night in San Jose on Monday.\n\nActor Jon Hamm hosted the NFL's end-of-season awards night on Thursday, which was attended by Steve Irwin's son Robert, who earlier in the day took a snake into the media centre to help promote the first NFL game in Melbourne later this year.\n\nShaquille O'Neal hosted a party on Friday while Post Malone held a free concert, with artists as diverse as Olivia Dean, Shaboozey, Sting, Calvin Harris, Zach Bryan and Teddy Swims playing at other events.\n\nCardi B also performed on Saturday before watching her partner Stefon Diggs play for the Patriots on Sunday, when Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones are also among the gameday performers.\n\nOther visitors include Roger Federer, Jay-Z, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and Paris St-Germain owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\n\nWahlberg's fellow New England fan Jon Bon Jovi will introduce the Patriots players on Sunday, with actor Chris Pratt, a Seattle supporter, doing the honours for the Seahawks.\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds. Plus you can listen to 5 Live's preview show on Friday and watch The Whole 10 Yards on iPlayer.\n\nThe cheapest resale ticket available on Thursday cost $4,388 (£3,222)\n\nLast year's Super Bowl was watched by a TV audience of 127.7 million people in the US\n\nLast year's half-time performance by Kendrick Lamar averaged 133.5 million viewers - making it the most-watched half-time show on record\n\nTV commercials have sold for an average of about $8m (£5.9m) for a 30-second slot, with a handful costing a record $10m\n\nAmericans will bet a record $1.76bn (£1.29bn) on Super Bowl 59, estimates the American Gaming Association\n\nThe National Chicken Council predicts that 1.48bn chicken wings will be eaten during the game\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is expected to generate more than $500m (£367m) for the local economy, with more than 90,000 visitors from outside the San Francisco Bay Area\n\nSuper Bowl 60 will kick off on Sunday at 23:30 GMT and be broadcast live on Channel 5, Sky Sports and DAZN.\n\nYou can listen to live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and BBC Sounds and follow live text coverage via the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nNBC will be the host broadcaster this year in the US.\n\nWhere the Super Bowl will be won and lost\n\nSeahawks or Patriots?

    "description": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's behaviour towards her pupils was branded \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it was hard to see her returning - but she is back for Milan-Cortina 2026.",
    "fullText": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's \"tremendous coldness\" was described as \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it may have been hard to imagine her returning to her sport's biggest stage.\n\nFour years later, the highly successful coach is at Milan-Cortina - and not everyone is happy about it.\n\nTutberidze and her training methods were under the spotlight at Beijing 2022 amid the Kamila Valieva doping scandal that rocked the Games, and it was the then-IOC president Thomas Bach who gave the stinging assessment of the coach.\n\nRather than comforting 15-year-old gold medal favourite Valieva when she left the ice in tears after falling several times, Tutberidze had instead asked the youngster \"why did you stop fighting?\"\n\nBach said he had been \"very, very disturbed\" by what he had seen and that it did not give him \"much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past, nor as far as it concerns the future\".\n\nWell, that future is here and so too is Tutberidze.\n\nNot only is Tutberidze back at the Olympics, but she is apparently coach to another Russian teenage medal hope.\n\nThat skater is 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, who is here as a neutral athlete (AIN) as Russia's team are banned from the Games because of the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Tutberidze is not officially listed as the teenager's coach in the media guide for these Games and it remains to be seen whether she will be at rinkside when Petrosian competes.\n\nWhoever she is with, there will be many eyes on Tutberidze, with the shadow of Valieva and Beijing 2022 set to loom large.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nTutberidze's official coaching role is with the Georgia figure skating team and she was at Milano Ice Skating Arena for the team event to watch one of her longest-serving pupils, Nika Egadze.\n\nEgadze stormed to victory at the 2026 European Championships in Sheffield, where Tutberidze shared a warm hug with her skater after a gold medal-winning performance, and other athletes spoke positively about the coach.\n\nIt was a different story at Milano Ice Skating Arena as Egadze endured two error-strewn routines, with Georgia missing out on a medal.\n\nIn the short programme he made two early errors, failing to land the triple toe loop in his first technical element.\n\nAs he continued his performance, the TV cameras caught Tutberidze in passing - standing at rinkside, arms folded.\n\nEgadze did enough to pull the performance around and help earn Georgia fifth place in qualifying, progressing to the final. When he came off the ice, the hug from Tutberidze seemed curt.\n\nShe joined the Georgian squad as they waited for the results. Generally, waiting teams will laugh and joke, even if they know elimination is coming.\n\nInstead, the 11 skaters and team members sat stony-faced as the scores were announced.\n\nIf this was an indicator of the atmosphere in the team, it is certainly not positive, but it may have just been a moment of nervous focus.\n\nPerhaps Tutberidze was minding her body language on Sunday as Egadze struggled even \n\nHis coach gave him a pat on the hand as the numbers came in. Despite Egadze scoring only 154.79 for the free skate - 27 points lower than his season best - there was no berating.\n\nThe attention comes at a Games which began for Georgia with their team being roundly booed in San Siro when they entered the stadium during the opening ceremony.\n\nOfficial views on Tutberidze's presence in Milan vary.\n\nGiven she has not been personally implicated in any doping scandals and has not broken any rules, Tutberidze has every right to be at the Olympics.\n\nShe has rejected any suggestions of wrongdoing in her career as a coach and said in 2022 she was baffled by Bach's remarks.\n\n\"There was an investigation at the time and no issues were found that could be actioned against that individual,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a media conference on Sunday.\n\n\"If you are going to take action against someone, you need evidence, and from what I gather there isn't any.\"\n\nHowever, World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) president Witold Banka said on Thursday he does not \"feel comfortable with her presence here\",, external while Britain's 1980 Olympic champion and BBC pundit Robin Cousins was unequivocal in his disdain.\n\n\"This comes down to the International Olympic Committee and International Skating Union - coaches are not part of the team,\" Cousins told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So when they ban a team, the coach of said team is not part of that. That is not correct, as far as I am concerned. I would not have her anywhere near Milan, personally.\n\n\"Is that because of behaviour, or Russia being banned? All of the above.\n\n\"The way we watched everything unfold, someone has to take the blame. Any skater would say the most important person is the coach; you trust them, you give yourself to them. That is not how you treat a student.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, a television documentary - The Tutberidze Method - was released in Russia, celebrating her track record in training medal winners.\n\nTwo of Tutberidze's skaters have won women's gold and silver medals at the past two Olympics, but both were amid drama.\n\nAs the Valieva saga played out, Beijing 2022 champion Anna Shcherbakova was left barely celebrating victory – later saying she felt \"emptiness\" – while silver medallist Alexandra Trusova was so disappointed to miss out on gold that she said before the medal ceremony that she never wanted to skate again.\n\nFour years before that, in 2018, favourite Evgenia Medvedeva was sobbing after being upstaged by 15-year-old training partner Alina Zagitova.\n\nIn the run-up to those two Games, Tutberidze's skaters had been hot favourites, dominating the World Championships and European Championships.\n\nLittle has been seen of Petrosian recently on the international stage because of Russia's ban from competition. The only real sighting of her was at September's qualifying event in Beijing, where she won gold, but not all the top skaters were there.\n\nPetrosian has also won the past three national championships – making it 11 years in a row for Tutberidze skaters – and she is the first woman to land a quadruple loop in competition, but she was injured last year and has struggled with errors this season.\n\nFollowing the Valieva episode, the minimum age for competitors was raised from 15 to 17, an age that has not been far off retirement age for some of Tutberidze's skaters in the past because of a combination of injury and a drop in technical skills.\n\nIt has been reported that her training model centres around female skaters peaking before they hit puberty., external\n\nItalian Daniel Grassl, who went to work with Tutberidze in Moscow in 2023, described her as a \"very good\" coach, adding: \"She can be a little bit cold but she was warm with us, and was supporting us.\"\n\nValieva, a mercurial talent who performances drew worldwide attention, was eventually banned for four years over her failed drugs test, but there were no sanctions for any of her entourage.\n\nHer team have always insisted the failed test - for heart medication trimetazidine - was the result of contaminated cutlery which had been tainted by her grandfather's medication, while Wada called for those behind the failed test to face justice because \"the doping of children is unforgivable\".\n\n\"Wada is not behind the decision to accredit the coach [for Milan-Cortina],\" Banka said. \"The investigation found no evidence this person [Tutberidze] engaged in the topic, so there is no legal basis to exclude her.\"\n\nValieva, now 19, has only just returned to skating, finishing sixth in the semi-finals of the Russian Jump Championships last week. She is no longer coached by Tutberidze.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has not had many tougher weeks in her managerial career and was defiant following their win at Tottenham.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has not had many tougher weeks in her managerial career.\n\nHaving fallen 12 points adrift of Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Manchester City, suffering back-to-back defeats in the process, pressure was at its highest.\n\nShe faced backlash from her own supporters, questions over her position at the club, and anything other than victory at Tottenham would have been a disaster.\n\nThe club rallied around the Frenchwoman, who led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble in her debut season, by announcing she had signed a four-year contract extension 48 hours before their crucial game at Spurs.\n\nThat was the backing she needed and Bompastor could breathe a sigh of relief - and even celebrate animatedly - as her side got over the line with a 2-0 win.\n\n\"Even if we all know we can't control anything of that, we probably felt it was unfair to receive that amount of criticism,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"I know who I am, I don't need people outside my environment to tell me who I am. I will always make sure I give my best. I know I have the competence, I know I have the knowledge, I know the women's game and I do my best for Chelsea.\n\n\"I'm not saying I'm the best one, I'm not saying I'm arrogant, but I know who I am. I always make sure I support my players in the best way possible.\n\n\"My job is to make sure they go on the pitch with clarity on what they need to achieve. No-one is going to disturb me on my confidence.\"\n\nWith the WSL title seemingly out of their grasp, Chelsea's priority is to ensure they clinch a top-three spot and qualification for next season's Champions League.\n\nRivals Arsenal and Manchester United did their part earlier in the weekend - so Chelsea had to respond.\n\nTottenham, who started the game a point behind Chelsea, came out of the blocks firing and could have taken the lead when Olivia Holdt hit the crossbar.\n\nNervy Chelsea were in a battle until Keira Walsh's goal just before half-time rocked Spurs and put the Blues in the driving seat. It was the \"game-changer\" they needed.\n\n\"When you want to perform at your best, you need to have the four elements of the performance align at the highest level - the tactical, mental, physical and technical aspects,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"If one of them, or some of them, are not as high as possible, it affects the performance. We were a different team in the second half. That's who we want to be.\"\n\nBompastor's actions were deliberate on Sunday. After the warm-up, she walked out on to the pitch and high-fived every member of her squad.\n\nShe celebrated with assistant coach Meline Gerard, who lifted her up and spun her around in the dugout, when Walsh's goal put Chelsea 1-0 up - something she rarely does, but said afterwards she should do more.\n\nIn normal circumstances, a victory at Tottenham would be seen as par for the course. But this was three points which gave Chelsea a significant boost.\n\n\"I will enjoy it. I'm not going to lie, it's been a difficult time. It's been tough so we need to celebrate with players and staff,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"We know when we are at Chelsea we need to win every game and we want, as much as possible, to be in control. To do that, we need to get points to win.\n\n\"We still have a lot to play for. We know what we can improve.\"\n\nChelsea's performance still left much to be desired but Bompastor said she was \"really proud\" of how her players dealt with the unfamiliar criticism.\n\nThe Blues have won six successive domestic titles so most in the squad have never experienced a season without silverware.\n\nThey have already booked their place in the Women's League Cup final, have a fifth-round FA Cup tie to play and are in the Champions League quarter-finals.\n\nIf they win a European crown - the one trophy that has eluded them - their WSL blip will be quickly forgotten.\n\nBut experienced midfielder Erin Cuthbert said the overall feeling was \"relief\" after the Spurs victory - and this was unknown territory for the serial winners.\n\n\"It's been a tough couple of weeks, an experience that some of us haven't been used to. Over the 10 years I've been here, we've had moments like this,\" Cuthbert told BBC Two.\n\n\"The league's getting better and we've played against two top teams who probably beat us quite convincingly. It was back to the drawing board this week.\n\n\"We didn't want to be a Chelsea team who bow down game after game. That's not what we're about, that's not what we're built upon.\n\n\"It was a difficult first 20 minutes. We got quite lucky to be honest. But you're going to need a bit of luck to get out of a hole.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "title": "The Department of Homeland Security Is Demanding That Google Turn Over Information About Random Critics",
    "description": "\"You don't have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.\"",
    "fullText": "The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.\n\nAccording to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.\n\n“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”\n\nFive hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.\n\n“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.\n\nThe subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.\n\n“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.\n\nAs DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.\n\n“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”\n\nWhen uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.\n\nWhen Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.\n\n“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”\n\n“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”\n\nMore on DHS: There’s Something So Embarrassing About Homeland Security’s New Drone Video That We’re Gonna Have to Sit Down for a Minute",

    "fullText": "Travel content creator Murphy Ng saw something distressing while hiking near the Maliau Basin Studies Centre in Sabah, Malaysia, The New Straits Times reported.\n\nNg was walking along the Avian Trail with a ranger last December. At first, he didn't know what he was looking at.\n\n\"We spotted several piles of elephant dung along the trail, and I noticed something metallic and shiny,\" Ng said. \"At first, I thought it was just a small candy wrapper, but when I pulled it out, it turned out to be an entire plastic bag, completely intact.\"\n\nThe Times said that Ng shared the incident on Facebook. He encouraged people to be mindful of how they dispose of plastic as well.\n\nThis wasn't the first time an animal has had plastic in its digestive system, and it likely won't be the last. Even if the elephant did swallow a candy wrapper, plastic of all sizes can be harmful.\n\nEnvironment America reported that microplastics can make fish swim more slowly and damage their genes, which they can pass down to their offspring. A pregnant sperm whale was also found with almost 50 pounds of plastic in her stomach. All kinds of plastic waste kill over 1 million marine animals every year.\n\nThe effects of plastic pollution on marine life ripple out into how people live, too.\n\nAs microplastics disrupt how oceans absorb carbon, air pollution persists and warms the planet. Rising temperatures are contributing to extreme weather events, which can cause people to lose their jobs, homes, and ways of life.\n\nReducing plastic pollution helps people and wildlife live fuller lives in healthier and safer environments.\n\nPer the Times, elephant expert Dr. Cheryl Cheah said there are no known elephant deaths in Malaysia linked to plastic consumption.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSupporting brands that use less plastic or make plastic obsolete, such as Stasher bags, is crucial to reducing overall plastic use. But those options can be more expensive upfront and aren't accessible to everyone.\n\nEncouraging and advocating for brands to use less plastic, especially if it's a coordinated effort, can help. Even making sure your plastic makes its way into the trash instead of the grass can reduce pollution in ecosystems.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Manchester City's win at Liverpool ended in complete chaos - but did the referee and the VAR get Dominik Szoboszlai's red card right?",
    "fullText": "Sometimes the video assistant referee (VAR) just cannot win, stuck in a hole between what feels right in the spirit of the game and what is correct in law.\n\nManchester City thought they had scored a third goal at Liverpool which would have capped off one of the most dramatic ends to a Premier League game this season.\n\nBut it was stripped away by a VAR review for a foul committed just before the ball rolled over the line.\n\nFans will hate it, pundits won't like it, and football will turn its nose up too. Yet there really was no way the VAR, John Brooks, could not intervene.\n\nA foul was committed that facilitated a goal being scored which might have otherwise been prevented. It is really as simple as that.\n\nIt was a unique set of circumstances right at the end of a dramatic game which gave City a 2-1 win at Anfield.\n\nHere's what happened and why...\n\nMan City fight back for dramatic late win at Liverpool\n\nWith Alisson marooned upfield for a set-piece as Liverpool searched for a late equaliser, Rayan Cherki kicked the ball towards an empty net from just inside his own half.\n\nHaaland gave chase and was clearly going to outpace Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nThe City striker had overtaken Szoboszlai 25 yards from goal and looked certain to win the race - but he was pulled back.\n\nIt was a clear foul which referee Craig Pawson identified, but he played an advantage.\n\nAs the ball rolled towards the goal with the same two players still jostling to reach it, Liverpool's Hungary international was about to slide in and clear it off the line.\n\nBefore Szoboszlai could do so, however, Haaland pulled him back, and that stopped the home player from keeping the ball out of the net.\n\nThe first pull on the Norway striker muddies the waters. After all, it seemed Haaland was definitely going to score.\n\nBut they are two distinct situations. You have to separate the first foul by Szoboszlai and the subsequent offence from Haaland.\n\nWould Szoboszlai have prevented the goal had he not been fouled? There is a high chance.\n\nOn that basis it is impossible for the goal to stand.\n\nRemember that Pawson played advantage. Had Szoboszlai been allowed to successfully keep the ball out, the play would have been brought back and he would have been sent off.\n\nThe end result would be the same as the outcome of the VAR intervention: no goal and Szoboszlai sent off for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\n\nIf you take out the first pull on Haaland, it is hard to see how anyone could have a problem with the goal being disallowed.\n\nThis is not the first time, or the last, that the VAR has correctly disallowed a goal and people really struggle to stomach it.\n\nYes, the goal could be important for Manchester City at the end of the season. But the goal conceded could also turn out to be vital for Liverpool.\n\nWhile the video assistant referee's intervention was ultimately correct, leading to Pawson to announce the decision to both teams and the fans, it certainly split the crowd.\n\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville, who was covering the game for Sky Sports, said it \"feels so unjust\".\n\nHe added: \"I know there's rules but there is the smell of the game. Talk about killjoy. Just let the goal be.\n\n\"You have just killed one of the great moments of the season.\n\n\"You live to watch games like this. I am a fan of VAR, but it has just killed the joy.\n\n\"The reason fans watch football matches is for entertainment and for moments like that.\"\n\nBut ex-Manchester United captain Roy Keane said, if anything, the moment \"just added to the drama\" and described it as \"great\".\n\nManchester City forward Haaland said he actually felt sorry for his ex-RB Salzburg team-mate Szoboszlai.\n\n\"The referee has to follow the rules,\" Haaland told Sky Sports. \"I feel bad for him. Just give the goal and not the red card, simple as that.\n\n\"But that's the rules and that's how it is.\"\n\nCity boss Pep Guardiola simply told BBC Match of the Day: \"Come on referee, give the goal and go home.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): Huge save at 2-1 to keep Manchester City ahead in their win at Liverpool. This is why they bought him in - he's the guy to make big saves. He commanded his area really, really well. He wasn't able to keep a clean sheet but that was because arguably the goal of the season got put past him. He was fantastic.\n\nJayden Bogle (Leeds): Excellent going forward, he has played a number of positions this season for the team but I thought he was excellent in the 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest. He was a real outlet down that right side which is obviously huge for them and a massive three points for being safe and staying up.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City) and Axel Disasi (West Ham): Both of them have had an instant impact when they've come into the team. Disasi has to defend a bit deeper at West Ham - big, organised, putting his body on the line. He gives them a physical presence they've missed.\n\nMarc was a little lucky with the Mohamed Salah pullback - to still be on the pitch. But his leadership experience for Abdukodir Khusanov was exceptional. The level of confidence he gives this Manchester City backline is huge. Him hitting the ground running was exceptional for them.\n\nEl Hadji Malick Diouf (West Ham): Wonderful cross for the goal in the win at Burnley. He's been sensational since he came back from the Africa Cup of Nations. He's really added pace, power and a little bit of bite they have been missing down that side. He didn't have a great start to the season but we're starting to see the full potential of him now.\n\nVitaly Janelt (Brentford): He obviously gets a goal - wonderful header - but I actually thought he was just the best player on the pitch in the 3-2 win at Newcastle. I agree with Jordan Henderson in the sense he should have had the man of the match but he played well, kept it simple, broke up the game, broke forward when he needed to. A real solid midfielder's performance.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): What a difference a manager makes - being able to be free, get on the ball, go wherever he wants and be creative. I think Michael Carrick takes a lot of credit for that but again, another goal for him against Spurs, another win for United - he has to go in.\n\nRayan (Bournemouth): He was fantastic in the draw with Aston Villa. We have to look at Lucas Digne defensively but everything he did, running forward with pace, power, direct. He caused problems throughout the day. He's a big strong boy that gets his team up the pitch and he gets at the opposition - and Digne had no answers for him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): We're going to put him in the 10 even though he played right-back, but when you score a goal like that you're in. Unbelievable free-kick against Manchester City with pure technique to slice across the ball to make it swing from left to right and leave Donnarumma stranded.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): His first start back under Liam Rosenior, talking about getting his fitness back up. He loses a few points because he was against a very bad Wolves team. However fantastic, a hat-trick, goals, penalties, confidence. The most important thing is he's smiling again - that's great for Chelsea and great for England so he deserves that, as does Rosenior for giving him that.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): I don't normally give subs the opportunity to start but Gyokeres to be fair came on at 60 minutes against Sunderland and scored two goals to get Arsenal over the line. Strong from him. Maybe having Jesus and Havertz around is going to bring out the best from him from a competitive point of view. But it's a fantastic day for him and a fantastic day for Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): Huge, huge result for him at Anfield. His changes influence the game, and I think with Arsenal winning it's do or die and City put in a solid performance. Still wobbly, still a few question marks but they got the result which is all that matters.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "A generation of Manchester City supporters had not experienced a winning feeling at Anfield - but all that changed on a highly dramatic Sunday evening.\n\nTrailing 1-0 to Liverpool in the 84th minute, it was turning into a theme familiar for the Citizens faithful until captain Bernardo Silva and the ice-cool Erling Haaland both netted in the dying stages to hand Pep Guardiola's side a memorable victory.\n\nCity supporters were riotous when Rayan Cherki rolled in a third into an empty net from just inside his own half, but the goal was eventually ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR).\n\nIt mattered little as they stayed well after the final whistle to celebrate their side's triumph - only a third in the league since 1981.\n\nIt was also result that keeps City in the title race. Just.\n\nBoss Pep Guardiola joked afterwards about their last victory at Anfield five years ago, which came behind closed doors during Covid restrictions, saying: \"That doesn't count, right?\"\n\nBut this brilliant turnaround meant City are only six points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 13 games left to play - including a Gunners visit to Etihad Stadium in April - having been staring at a nine-point deficit in the closing stages.\n\n\"It is so difficult, Anfield is Anfield - the tradition, the history and the crowd,\" added Guardiola. \"It always looks smaller, tighter here and the pitch doesn't look like Etihad Stadium - and the players that they have, and everything.\n\n\"Of course we would be disappointed and all the questions would be over and over [about the title race] but six points is better than nine. It is still a lot considering how strong Arsenal are in all departments.\n\n\"The last 10 games, from my experience, it is so difficult. The important thing is to try to be there and improve because the second half was not good enough again.\n\n\"All we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal and being there, try if they go slip [up] and use it.\"\n\n'Killjoy' - did VAR get late drama in Liverpool v Man City right?\n\nPremier League: Man City fight back to beat Liverpool as Szoboszlai sent off in dramatic finish\n\nThe City substitutes piling over to their fans after Cherki's goal showed how much the victory meant to them - one supporter even got carried away and jumped on to the pitch before being led away by stewards.\n\nIt was an incredible conclusion to an engrossing encounter, one that has repeatedly delivered drama in Guardiola's past tussles with Jurgen Klopp and now Arne Slot.\n\nThese two sides have been the only teams to lift the Premier League trophy over the past eight years and, while reigning champions Liverpool have fallen away this term and sit in sixth place, City are clinging on.\n\n\"What can this do to Manchester City confidence-wise, going forward?\" said former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's all about putting runs together at this stage and that is a massive result that can give them a huge confidence boost.\n\n\"They might well just - and I mean just - be in this.\"\n\nAfter their 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium earlier in the season, City achieved a league double over Liverpool for the first time since the 1936-37 campaign.\n\n\"It's an important one for City today,\" former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport. \"It's a tough place to go, Anfield.\n\n\"I thought Liverpool were really good in the second half, City were really good first half - then City have gone a goal down and dug in to get the three points.\"\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville added: \"Will this give them the bit between the teeth? Will this give them the confidence to go and chase down Arsenal?\n\nCity captain Silva started the game after recovering from a recent hamstring issue and was the catalyst for his side's comeback by prodding in the equaliser from a Haaland knockdown.\n\nThe Portuguese has now played more game against Liverpool (16) than any other City player, while his three goals at Anfield makes him City's joint-top scorer at the stadium alongside Nicolas Anelka and Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nHaaland, by contrast, scored a first goal at Anfield with his winning penalty in the third minute of added time.\n\n\"I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over,\" said Silva. \"We felt like we needed to win.\n\n\"The hope is there and we are going to fight until the end. We need to keep doing our job that we haven't lately.\"\n\nOn Sunday, no player ran more than Silva's 12.84km, while no City player made more passes in the final third than his 24, nor did they attempt more dribbles than his four.\n\nEarlier this season, Guardiola said he has a \"weakness\" for the 31-year-old and a player he \"loves\" very much.\n\nSilva is out of contract in the summer and the City boss added: \"He is one of the best players I have every trained with.\n\n\"He is the perfect captain. It is a joy for me as a manager to have him. The team comes first.\n\n\"His contribution is massive and he is one of the legends of this club.\"",

    "fullText": "LISBON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Moderate Socialist Antonio Jose Seguro appeared to be ​headed for a landslide victory in ‌Portugal's presidential runoff on Sunday, with two exit polls ‌putting him in the 67%-73% range, well ahead of his far-right, anti-establishment rival Andre Ventura.\n\nThe exit polls conducted for television ⁠channels RTP, SIC ‌and TVI/CNN placed Ventura at 27%-33%, still a better result than ‍the 22.8% his anti-immigration Chega party achieved in last year's general election.\n\nLast year, Chega became ​the second-largest parliamentary force, overtaking the ‌Socialists and landing behind the centre-right ruling alliance, which garnered 31.2%.\n\nDespite his loss on Sunday, 43-year-old Ventura, a charismatic former TV sports commentator, can now boast increased ⁠support, reflecting the growing ​influence of the far ​right in Portugal and much of Europe.\n\nThe presidency is a largely ceremonial ‍role in ⁠Portugal but wields some key powers, including in some circumstances to dissolve parliament, ⁠to call a snap parliamentary election, and to ‌veto legislation.",

    "fullText": "A Caldwell company agreed to change its advertising after Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s office accused the business of misleading customers.\n\nLabrador’s office sued Right Now Heating, Cooling & Plumbing, alleging it was running deceptive direct-mail advertisements that claimed customers could obtain a furnace or air conditioning unit for a discounted price. Right Now denied the allegations.\n\n“You can get rid of your old furnace and replace with a brand new, top of the line furnace for $1,200,” one of the advertisements said.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office alleges that the claim and others made by the company were not true.\n\nThe lawsuit said that to get a new furnace, the customer would have to pay the installation cost for the furnace and a new air conditioning unit, and Right Now’s ad “does not disclose clearly and conspicuously the cost of the furnace or provide the complete cost to purchase and install both units.”\n\nLabrador’s office said customers have complained that the company failed to provide them with an itemized contract identifying the equipment and services they agreed to buy, and that they were provided a document titled “estimate” that the company contended was a sales contract.\n\nLabrador’s office said the company’s “estimate” had a tendency to mislead or confuse reasonable customers. It accused Right Now of a pattern of unfair competition and deceptive acts that violate the Idaho Consumer Protection Act and the Idaho Rules of Consumer Protection.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office and Right Now agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in which the company agreed to change its advertising to clearly disclose the total cost it charges customers to purchase and install its HVAC products. For instance, if the company advertises that a customer can purchase an air conditioner for $1,475 installed, it must sell the air conditioner for that price.\n\nThe agreement, in which Right Now does not admit liability, requires the company to keep all records related to customer complaints it receives for two years after the date it takes effect.\n\n“Right Now’s stipulations to the terms of this assurance do not constitute admissions by it to any facts or violations of any state or federal law, rule or regulation,” the agreement says. “Right Now enters into this assurance for the purpose of resolving the Attorney General’s concerns ... “\n\nThe company agreed to pay the Attorney General’s office $6,500 for fees and costs it incurred in pursing the lawsuit.\n\nCanyon County District Judge Randall Grove approved the agreement on Dec. 22.\n\nIdaho’s ban on buying candy or soda with food stamps is imminent.

    "description": "Likely thing for them to do!",
    "fullText": "Green Day has never been part of the MAGA agenda. The California rock band has called out Donald Trump and his administration in many of their music performances, and it doesn’t look like they’re stopping any time soon.\n\nIn recent years, the band—consisting of members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tré Cool—has replaced the lyrics of their iconic hit “American Idiot.” The song, written in 2004, initially included the lyrics “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda.” Now, when performing the song live, Armstrong sings, “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” The song itself, and the titular album it was written for, was a direct criticism of George W. Bush’s administration and the Iraq war.\n\nTrump Finally Addresses Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Abduction Years After She Called His Behavior 'Crazy' at Town Hall\n\nWhite House Officially Addresses Trump & Vance Feud Rumors After Reports the President Is Prepared to 'Strike' Against the VP's 'Betrayal'\n\nArmstrong also takes a jab at Vice President JD Vance through revised lyrics of “Jesus of Suburbia.” So what’s the beef between the president and the band?\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected into office in November 2016, the band led a chant  “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” during an appearance at the American Music Awards.\n\nDuring the first days of the first Trump administration, Billie Joe Armstrong wrote on Instagram about his immigration executive orders that targeted countries with large Muslim populations: “I feel like I’m in a state of shock. The executive orders Trump is signing feels like a vendetta.. Trump is not only taking out his revenge on the people who protested him, but also the average American that just didn’t vote for him.”\n\nHe continued, “These reckless decisions on healthcare, muslim-americans, immigration, environmental protection, freedom of speech, freedom of press, women’s right to choose what to do with their bodies, suggesting sending in the feds to Chicago .. are signs of a man that is trying to redefine what it is that keeps our common union as Americans. This is not just his ‘conservative agenda.’ It’s an all out assault on our civil liberties. His intention is to divide us as Americans. Maybe we don’t agree on all of these issues.. But can’t we see eye to eye on some?”\n\nIn an interview with NME, Armstrong said that Trump supporters were mostly “uneducated white working-class people.” Armstrong added: “That’s the problem right there. There’s this white nationalism that’s been brewing under the radar for a long time. But now [Trump’s] been able to cause people to lash out and blame minorities and it’s really confusing. I mean, blatant misogyny going on at the same time.”\n\n“I’ve got family members from Oklahoma that are big Trump supporters. And there’s no clear answer on why they’re supporting him because he doesn’t even have any policies,” he continued. “How can you have an opinion about who you want for the Leader of the Free World when the guy running doesn’t have answers to any questions?”\n\nWhen the band performed in Washington D.C., Armstrong emphasized that the sentiments didn’t feel as intense or different as other concerts. “Outside of “f—k you,” not a real lot, honestly,” the lead singer told Rolling Stone. “People know how I feel. I feel like going negative is just throwing fuel on the fire. I feel like the government is trying to create a culture war between us in a lot of ways. They’re trying to get between your average citizens based on red and blue. I think we’re in a crisis mode right now. For me, it’s important to get back to fundamentally what it feels like to be an American. We all come from different backgrounds, but we come together and create this world. It’s like a microcosm for the rest of the world. I want people to feel unity when they come to a show. At the same time, I’m not going to puss out on saying what I feel about him and his administration.”\n\nWhen asked about their obligations in the Trump administration, Cool said, “I think we have an obligation to put on a fun show and put on a concert that’s memorable, that’s energetic and that spreads joy and open-mindedness. If being open-minded and joyful is against your political beliefs, then you know, fuck you.”\n\nIn June 2025, Armstrong shared his feelings about the president. “Donald Trump in his administration is a fascist government,” Armstrong told the crowd at Download Festival in Donington Park in the U.K. . “And it’s up to us to fight back.”\n\nGreen Day was announced as a performer in the opening ceremonies for Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif., a couple of miles away from the band’s roots. When asked about whether he’ll attend the football game, Trump told reporters that he would not and then criticized the performers, which also included halftime performer Bad Bunny. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nIn their first performance of 2026, the band made their stance loud and clear with the iconic “American Idiot” line. During the performance of “Holiday” and “Know Your Enemy,” Armstrong said, “This song is anti-fascism. This song is anti-war. We stand up for our brothers and sisters in Minnesota. … Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Miller now has the floor,” referring to the ICE raids in Minneapolis that resulted in the deaths of Alex Pretto and Renee Good, while the latter line is a direct reference to homeland security advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nArmstrong also added the same sentiments when the band performed at a Super Bowl pre-show hosted by Spotify and Fanduel on Friday, Feb. 6. “This goes out to all the ICE agents out there. Wherever you are: quit your shitty-ass job. Quit that shitty job you have.” He added, “come on this side of the line.”\n\n“Because when this is over — and it will be over at some point in time — Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, J.D. Vance, Donald Trump, they’re going to drop you like a bad f—king habit.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",
