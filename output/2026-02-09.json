Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nAs one of the only member-owned major clubs left in Europe, Barcelona will take a major step towards defining the future of the institution over the next two months.\n\nOn March 15, Barcelona \"socios\" will elect the next club president who will lead Barcelona into the next era of European and global football. Until then, we'll have six weeks of campaigning, in which time candidates must drum up sufficient support.\n\nRequired by the club's bylaws to hold elections every five years, the current mandate of president Joan Laporta is set to expire, and he has called for new elections for himself and the board to be held in March. That means the incumbents must resign their positions on Monday, February 9.\n\nThe Sporting News explains why this is happening, who the candidates for election could be, and what each one stands for as the Barcelona faithful aim to decide the best leader for the next phase of the club's illustrious history.\n\nMORE:Who owns Barcelona? Explaining the \"socio\" model and how to become one\n\nThe duties of the president of Barcelona are wide-ranging. The individual is responsible for overseeing players and coaches signing contracts, managing the finances of the club, chairing General Assembly meetings, and much more.\n\nIn essence, the president runs the day-to-day operations of the club while serving as the public face of the team and Barcelona brand. Barca's executives, such as the sporting director, report to the president.\n\nFrom 2026 onwards, presidential terms at Barcelona will be five years in length, at which point elections must be held for both president and all board members. Laporta's current term will be the last to run for six years. According to Mundo Deportivo, Laporta said \"sometimes, six years is just too long\" during his campaign for election in 2021.\n\nLaporta has scheduled the presidential election for Barcelona for March 15, 2026.\n\nAs per club statutes, Laporta has stated that he will resign from his position at the General Assembly on Monday, February 9, along with a significant number of the board. Starting then, candidates for election will go about gathering signatures, as they require at least 2,321 socios to support their candidacy to officially stand for election.\n\nFrom then until the election, a regency will take charge of the club. A number of board members — at least six, or one third of the total board — are likely to remain in position to avoid necessitating the formation of a temporary management committee.\n\nChallengers to Laporta have criticized the decision to hold elections midseason, stating that the timeline \"suits Laporta\" but does not do the club the service of a fully fair and balanced election process.\n\nCandidates for Barcelona president must have been a socio for at least 10 years, and must gather at least 2,321 socio signatures backing their candidacy.\n\nPresidential candidates are also required to, together with their executive board, present a \"financial guarantee\" worth 15 percent of the club's budget. Barcelona's club statutes state that the executive board is \"liable for their actions\" while in office, and thus the guarantee is a means of backing that claim financially, with the aim to protect against poor governance and mismanagement.\n\nWhile this process plays out, candidates for election will not be finalized until they present both the signatures and financial backing to solidify their candidacy. This process will not conclude until closer to the date of the election, and thus this list of candidates is, for now, simply a list of \"pre-candidates\".\n\nThe sitting president of Barcelona is Joan Laporta. He has been in office since being elected in 2021, taking over for Josep Bartomeu, who had resigned in 2020 amid widespread anger at the club's management, specifically the dire financial situation and Bartomeu's public spat with Lionel Messi.\n\nLaporta is currently in his second stint as president of the club. He was first elected in 2003 and spent seven years at the helm, during which he saw the rise of Messi and the hiring of Pep Guardiola.\n\nAfter a decade spent in Catalan politics, Laporta returned to Barcelona with his election in 2021, where he has since been tasked with stabilising the club's finances after the emergency situation brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic and years of financial mismanagement under Bartomeu.\n\nUnder Laporta's leadership, Barcelona are through the most immediate danger brought about by their money struggles, when it seemed shockingly plausible that they could cease to exist entirely, but they are still significantly in debt.\n\nThe club is believed to owe around €1.5 billion ($1.8bn), thanks in part to the massive renovation project to update their stadium, Camp Nou. The club is banking on revenue from the improved venue to rectify the situation in the long term, but for now, they are still under considerable financial strain.\n\nAccording to Barcelona's treasurer in January of 2026, the club still has liabilities of around €2.5bn ($3bn), with the New York Times describing Laporta's strategy as \"spending its way out of crisis.\"\n\nThe Camp Nou renovation is Laporta's crown jewel, and he has platformed on the goal of hosting the 2029 UEFA Champions League final at the newly overhauled stadium. Unfortunately, the renovation process has not been smooth and has been saddled with financial overreaches, significant delays, and other bad press including water leaks.\n\nVictor Font, 53, is making a second run at the Barcelona presidency, and is considered the most serious challenger to the incumbent. He lost to Laporta in the 2021 election to replace Bartomeu, receiving 30 percent of the vote to Laporta's 54.3 percent.\n\nFont is the co-founder of Delta Partners, a financial tech consulting firm, and has deep roots in Catalan football. He is a part-owner of Catalan publication Ara and also of football analytics company Kognia Sports Intelligence.\n\nFont's main platform is a pullback on Laporta's aggressive financial tactics. He has criticized Laporta's use of \"levers\" to achieve short-term financial solvency at the cost of leveraging the club's future earnings. Critics of his economic plan believe that it will harm Barcelona's ability to compete now, which could damage the club's image and trajectory.\n\nFont has also platformed on reducing the presidential term to four years alongside other reforms such as overhauling the requirements to run for a position on the board. He also wishes to create a ticket package tailored to socios who are not season-ticket holders, and he is promoting an expanded voting system that incentivises mail-in and electronic voting for long-distance members.\n\nPerhaps Font's most publicized campaign promise is that he wishes to make every possible effort to bring Messi back to Barcelona to finish his career where it began.\n\nXavier Vilajoana, also 53, is the CEO of Grup Euroconstruc, a development company specializing in affordable housing and sustainable construction. He attempted to run in the 2021 election but could not earn the requisite number of socio signatures.\n\nVilajoana was once, in his youth, a member of the famed La Masia academy, and went on to captain Barcelona's futsal team. He has been heavily involved in Barcelona's executive setup since then, and was on the board during Bartomeu's presidency.\n\nGiven his efforts within the club, Vilajoana has attempted to take credit for a lot of the club's current success on the pitch, pointing to the successful current youth product. He is concurrently saying that Laporta's claims to their recent run of results under Hansi Flick should not be attributed to the sitting president, but instead the years of groundwork laid by previous regimes to which Vilajoana was a key contributor.\n\nWhile Vilajoana's knowledge of the club's history, background, and inner workings is clear, his ties to a disgraced Bartomeu will likely work against him in any bid for the presidency, even if he has tried to distance himself from that time.\n\nThe final presidential candidate is sports economist and financier Marc Ciria.\n\nCiria has taken Font's promise to bring Messi back to Barcelona one step further, not only claiming he will pursue it with reckless abandon, but calling such a move \"strategic... for the future of the club and to protect and preserve the ownership model.\" Ciria pointed to the club's current revenue, which he says is below expectations when comparing it to Messi's time at the club, as proof that the Blaugrana legend is \"essential\" to the club's health.\n\nDubbed \"Movement 42,\" Ciria's plan centers around massive restructuring of the club's financial setup. \"When things aren't working, you have to change them, you have to start over,\" Ciria says.",

Seven players have scored for Team USA, with Alex Carpenter, Hayley Scamurra and Hilary Knight netting two goals apiece.\n\nKnight's goal against Finland was the 14th of her Olympic career, tying the U.S. record shared by Natalie Darwitz and Katie King. If the captain scores again in Milan, she'll stake sole claim to the record.\n\nThe Swiss opened the tournament with a shootout win over Czechia but fell 4-0 to Canada on Saturday. The U.S. will try to dismiss them in similar fashion ahead of Tuesday's showdown to end group play.\n\nHere's how to watch all the action from Milan.\n\nUSA vs. Switzerland will air live on USA Network with Kenny Albert on play-by-play and AJ Mleczko providing analysis.

I think they'll definitely be looking over their shoulders.\"\n\nCaptain Cristian Romero was sent off in the first half at Old Trafford for a late lunge on Casemiro, his sixth dismissal in a Spurs shirt.\n\n\"I can see why it's been given but I think it's a little bit harsh,\" said Rooney.\n\n\"Sometimes you lose your head at times. And I think he's done that throughout his time at Tottenham.\"\n\nIt came days after Romero's social media post which seemed to criticise the people who run the club - when he said it was \"disgraceful\" they only had 11 fit players for a 2-2 draw with Manchester City.\n\n\"What doesn't help is comments in the week before about the lack of players Tottenham have,\" added Rooney.\n\n\"He clearly speaks his mind as well. But unfortunately, you've got to go and back that up with performances when you're vocal like that - and I don't think he's done that. All that's going to do is bring more pressure on Thomas Frank.\"\n\nRooney has sympathy for Frank, who managed Brentford for seven years before moving across London last summer to replace Postecoglou.\n\n\"I feel for Thomas Frank because he looks tired, he looks like he's aged 10 years,\" he said.\n\n\"That's what that Tottenham job has done to him in a short period of time. I hope they stick with him because he's fantastic manager, but I think it's going be very difficult for them to do that.\n\n\"And you don't need your captain going out getting sent off on a regular basis or being as vocal as he was this week.\"\n\nWatch The Wayne Rooney Show on BBC iPlayer or listen on BBC Sounds.\n\nLatest Tottenham news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Tottenham - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "How ‘Walking Hall of Famer’ Devon Witherspoon put his stamp on Super Bowl win",
    "description": "Devon Witherspoon’s teammate called him a future Hall of Famer after his game-changing performance in the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory.",
    "fullText": "There was a moment after Uchenna Nwosu crossed the goal line to score a decisive touchdown late in the Super Bowl when Devon Witherspoon had a strong case for the game’s Most Valuable Player award.\n\nThe box score momentarily read that Witherspoon had just notched his second sack and forced a fumble that fell into Nwosu’s arms. Nwosu ran 45 yards and scored, making it a 29-7 game, effectively ending the New England Patriots’ slim hopes at a miracle comeback.\n\nBut the box score was corrected by NFL officials moments later, giving Nwosu the interception and taking away a sack and forced fumble from Witherspoon’s stat line. Had it held, his MVP case might have been stronger than running back Kenneth Walker, who had 161 yards from scrimmage, but wasn’t part of any touchdown plays, as Witherspoon was.\n\nAfter all, the story of Sunday’s 29-13 championship triumph from the Seahawks was the defense’s domination of second-year quarterback Drake Maye. And Witherspoon’s stat line would have jumped out over Derick Hall and Byron Murphy, who each had two sacks. Maye was sacked six times, finished with a fumble and two interceptions while the Seahawks won the turnover battle 3-0.\n\nNot that anyone with the Seahawks mind that Walker won MVP. Lifting of the Lombardi Trophy for the second time in the organization’s history, the hugs, celebratory cigars and the other once-in-a-lifetime moments at Levi’s Stadium mean far more than quibbles over box score stats and MVP cases.\n\nBut there’s little doubt Witherspoon has cemented himself as one of the best defensive backs in the NFL — and has a chance to go down as an all-time Seahawks player if he continues his current trajectory.\n\n“He’s a walking Hall of Famer, right now,” Seahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV said. “He’s a dog. He’s my favorite player in the NFL. He can do everything.”\n\nWitherspoon had four tackles, a sack, and three quarterbacks hits, including the one on Maye that led to Nwosu’s touchdown. His sack in the first quarter ended New England’s second drive in a string that included 10 straight possessions that ended in either a punt or kneel down to end the first half.\n\nHis performance in the Super Bowl will get added to a resume that already includes three Pro Bowls in his first three seasons, and potentially a contract atop the market. The No. 5-overall pick in the 2023 draft is eligible for an extension for the first time this offseason.\n\n“The soul of our defense, ‘Spoon is the heart of it,” safety Julian Love said. “If you know football and you watch our tape, 21 jumps off the screen every single play, every single game, every single rep. It’s just raw talent. It’s playing football the right way. He’s just a ballplayer. And he’s been that way since the first time he stepped in the building.”\n\nThe Patriots didn’t score a touchdown until early in the fourth quarter, trimming a 19-0 to 19-7. Witherspoon, and his teammates, throttled New England to the tune of 78 yards on offense through the first three quarters. They exploded for 253 in the fourth when the game was largely out of hand to finish with a respectable 331. The final number did not represent how much Seattle’s “Dark Side” controlled the game.\n\nWhen relayed being called a Hall of Famer by Jones, Witherspoon said, “It means everything. Talk about a great teammate, Ernest, he’s everything to us, man. A ‘Mike’ linebacker who sets the standard for us. ... Right now, I’m just focused on the now, living in the present.”\n\nSeahawks coach Mike Macdonald dialed up more blitzes early in the game than the Seahawks typically had throughout the season. He called nine pressures, by unofficial count, in the first half. That 36% rate is nearly double their 19.3% rate from the regular season, according to Pro Football Reference.\n\nOf course, Witherspoon’s blitzes resulted in his first-quarter sack that came on an early third down that helped set the tone of the game. And his hit on Maye that led to Nwosu’s touchdown will be remembered as a highpoint in the Seahawks’ Super Bowl victory.\n\n“I haven’t been blitzing a lot this year,” Witherspoon said. “But it was best for our team, and I’m going to do whatever I need to do for our team to win.”",

    "fullText": "K League sides in continental competition will take to the field for their first competitive matches of 2026 in midweek, looking to shake off any rust and continue their pursuits of 2025-2026 AFC Champions League glory.\n\nVissel Kobe (1st, JPN) vs. FC Seoul (5th) - 19:00 KST\n\nFC Seoul will play their first competitive match of 2026 away to AFC Champions League Elite leaders Vissel Kobe, as the continent's premier club competition resumes for Match Day 7. Seoul had been in decent form before the winter break, earning five points from their last three ACLE outings, the last being a 1-1 draw with Melbourne City. Vissel Kobe, meanwhile, were able to preserve their place in first with a 2-2 draw at home to Chengdu Rongcheng, making it three unbeaten following wins over Ulsan and Shanghai Shenhua. Kobe got their domestic campaign up and running on Friday in the J1 100 Year Vision League, away to Kyoto Sanga, drawing 1-1 then winning 4-1 on penalties.\n\nKobe's clash with Ulsan was one of two against K League opposition in the 2025-2026 edition of the competition, the other being a thrilling 4-3 loss away to Gangwon. Seoul, meanwhile, have faced J.League opposition just once so far this campaign, earning a 1-1 draw away to Machida Zelvia last September. Kobe will be a tough nut to crack for Seoul, with the J1 League champions leading the way for clean sheets with four and having shown their attacking prowess with the second-most touches in the box and the best shot conversion rate in the competition of 18.8%. Seoul, meanwhile, rank first for accurate passes per match, so will be expected to have lots of possession of the ball, despite being the away side, and rank fourth for big chances created.\n\nSeoul will have to be wary of Yoshinori Muto, Kobe's goal scorer on Friday, who ranks second for shots on target per 90 with 2.7, ranks first for successful dribbles (75%), and has two goals and one assist to his name in the ACL. The capital club will be looking to new recruit Song Min-kyu to fill Jesse Lingard's shoes. Song has featured in AFC club competitions 18 times, scoring five and assisting one.\n\nGangwon FC (9th) vs. Shanghai Port (12th, CHN) - 19:00 KST\n\nGangwon FC got off to a great start in their debut ACL season, but form tailed off towards the end of 2025, and now the Bears sit outside the qualification group. Jeong Kyung-ho's men are ninth, but just a point behind Johor Darul Ta'zim, Buriram United, and Ulsan, and face basement side Shanghai Port next. The Chinese Super League giants have managed to pick up just two points from their first six ACLE matches, owing to draws with Sanfrecce Hiroshima and JDT. They also lost 3-1 to FC Seoul in what is so far their only clash with a K League side this campaign.\n\nGangwon's continental bow brought a 2-1 home win over Port's city neighbours Shanghai Shenhua, but was followed up by a 1-0 loss away to Chengdu Rongcheng. Gangwon will look to control the game with the lion's share of possession, having racked up the highest so far among teams in the East side of the competition with 59.9%, but will be looking to get more shots on target, ranking ninth in that regard. Shanghai Port are the reigning Chinese Super League champions and were not among the teams deducted points for match fixing. Although unlikely, qualification to the Round of 16 is still mathematically possible, but it would take two wins from their last two games, and for results elsewhere to go their way.\n\nKim Dae-won will be Gangwon's player to watch, creating 3.1 chances per 90 on average and 13 overall as the Bears' best in that regard and the best among players in the East side of the competition. But if Gangwon can create chances, they'll need to find a way past Port goalkeeper Wei Chen, who ranks third for save percentage (81.8%) and first for saves per 90 with 6.8.\n\nUlsan HD (8th) vs. Melbourne City (4th, AUS) - 19:00 KST\n\nUlsan HD begin life under new manager Kim Hyun-seok with the visit of A-League Men side Melbourne City. They do so sitting just inside the qualification group for the Round of 16, but will need to start picking up wins if they are to reach the knockouts. The Horangi lost 3-1 away to Machida Zelvia in their last ACL outing, and are on a run of three without a win. City, meanwhile, sit fourth having put together a run of four matches unbeaten with three victories. Their most recent outing was a very credible 1-1 draw away to FC Seoul. Domestically, Melbourne City are seventh in the table following five wins, seven draws and five losses, with just two wins in their last six, however. On Saturday, City played out a 1-1 draw with Western Sydney Wanderers.\n\nUlsan rank fifth for shots on target per match with 4.8, but will need to improve their conversion rate which stands at just 7.8%. The Horangi have also found it hard to create meaningful chances, ranking seventh for big chances with 12 and just five goals scored. City have been clinical with seven goals scored from 10 big chances, but 2.5 shots on target per match might not be sustainable. If Ulsan can defend well against their A-League counterparts, they could emerge with all three points.\n\nDarijan Bojanic will be key to Ulsan again this season and indeed this Wednesday. The Swede is first for accurate passes per 90 at 68.9, while Max Caputo, despite being on the bench against Wanderers at the weekend, is City's top scorer domestically with six and has two goals in ACLE thus far. It'll be the first-ever meeting between the two teams, but Ulsan have a record of nine wins, three draws and three losses versus Australian opposition, and are unbeaten in their last nine, while City have two wins and one draw from just three meetings.\n\nPohang Steelers vs. Gamba Osaka (JPN) - 19:00\n\nIn AFC Champions League Two, Pohang Steelers host Gamba Osaka on Thursday in the first leg of their Round of 16 tie. Pohang won four of their six Group H matches, losing just one but face a Gamba Osaka side that won all six of their Group F matches, keeping four clean sheets and conceding just two goals. Gamba finished ninth in the J1 last season and managed just five away wins from 19 matches. They began the new domestic campaign with a 0-0 draw in the Osaka derby, but won 5-4 on penalties, in what turned out to be a 10 vs. 10 affair with Takeru Kishimoto sent off on 84 minutes and Hayato Tanaka for Cerezo.\n\nThursday's contest might prove to be a tight affair with both teams boasting solid defenses, conceding just two goals each so far. Pohang have racked up the most possession so far with 69.7%, while Gamba rank third in that regard with 68.6%, having both played against teams that defended in low blocks. Pohang rank third for shots on target per match with 6.5, while Gamba are the competition's best passers wth 581.2 accurate passes per match.\n\nPohang faced Gamba in the 2012 ACL group stage, earning two wins - 2-0 at home and 3-0 away. Gamba have a record of eight wins, six draws and 11 losses against K League opposition over the years, with the most recent meetings being against Jeonbuk in 2021. In Korea, Gamba's record reads three wins, three draws, and five losses.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhile the Seattle Seahawks won the Super Bowl, their trophy presentation was a little awkward.\n\nJody Allen accepted the Lombardi Trophy as Seattle's ownership representative, as the Seahawks get to take the championship back to Seattle for a second time. However, Seattle's ownership situation may be changing during the offseason.\n\nSeahawks owner Jody Allen lifts the Lombardi trophy 🏆\n\nWhat a moment for Seattle 👏 (📺 NBC) pic.twitter.com/PamZCA2vZT\n\n— espnW (@espnW) February 9, 2026\n\nAccording to ESPN, the Seahawks are expected to go up for sale during the offseason, ending an eight-year ownership journey that began with Paul Allen's death. So, while Jody Allen is the face of the ownership group, the whole organization is more complicated than that.\n\nHere's a breakdown of Jody Allen and the Seahawks ownership situation.\n\nBad Bunny halftime show reviews\n\nWinners and losers from Super Bowl 60\n\nKenneth Walker ends 28-year RB MVP drought\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade details\n\nBest and worst Super Bowl commercials in 2026\n\nThe technical owner of the Seahawks is the Paul G. Allen Trust, as Paul Allen was the majority of the owner of the team for two decades. When Allen died, the executor and trustee of the trust became the team's owner, and that was Jody Allen.\n\nJody Allen is the sister of former Seahawks owner Paul Allen, who died in 2018. Jody was named the executor and trustee of Paul's estate upon his death, as Paul Allen never married and didn't have any kids.\n\nJody Allen's official title is \"Chair of the Seattle Seahawks.\" She also chair and co-founder of Vale Group, a private holding company she co-founded with her brother.\n\nJody Allen is selling the Seahawks, but that was the expectation after Paul Allen passed away. The former Seahawks owner and Microsoft co-founder died in 2018, and commissioner Roger Goodell said it was clear after Allen passed away that the team would be sold.\n\nRoger Goodell on the #Seahawks possible sale: \"I think when Paul Allen passed away, it was made clear that the team would eventually be sold. Jody is doing a great job. ... Eventually the team will need to be sold. That will be Jody's decision when she does that.\"\n\n— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) February 2, 2026\n\nJody Allen is Paul Allen's sister, as she was his closest living relative upon his death. She currently serves as the executor and trustee of the Paul G. Allen Trust, which is how she became the Seahawks owner.\n\nWhen Jody Allen became executor and trustee of Paul Allen's trust, she became in control of Paul Allen's $20 billion net worth. While Jody isn't worth nearly that much herself, her brother was one of the richest people in the world when he died.",

    "fullText": "Guarding Michael Jordan never felt more like a death sentence than it did for Kevin Johnson during the 1993 NBA Finals. Johnson has long stated how he feels terrible about how Charles Barkley is ringless due to that Finals. However, with MJ on the other end of the court, perhaps that was inevitable?\n\nThe ’93 Finals had several intersecting and interesting storylines. One was the fact that Jordannever saw Dan Majerle as a threat. Dan was propped up to be a ‘Jordan stopper’ of sorts but this didn’t move the needle for him in the slightest.\n\nGames 1 and 2 saw Jordan score a total of 73 points and the Bulls go up 2-0 with Majerle guarding ‘His Airness’. The Suns coaching staff saw this as a clear misstep and defensive deficiency. Their next course of action? Have Kevin Johnson take up the task.\n\n“I walk straight in that church and I sit in the front row. I’m like, ‘Jesus, I don’t believe in you no more,’” saidJohnson the Club520 podcast. The concept of having to defend Michael in the Finals was so unfathomable for KJ that he, at first, believed he had dreamt it.\n\nWhen he told MJ during Game 3’s jumpball that he was guarding him, the latter’s reaction was a mere “Huh?”\n\nFunnily enough, the Suns ended up winning Game 3 in triple overtime despite Jordan’s 44. Johnson was no scrub however as he held his own on the offensive end as well, going 11-24 from the field and having 25 points on the night.\n\nThe Suns won two out of their three games in Chicago but would eventually lose Game 6, leading to the Bulls winning their third straight title.\n\nKevin is still quite proud of the way he guarded Mike though, saying “Take that Mike!” on the podcast when speaking on keeping MJ below the scoring average he had when guarded by Dan.\n\nThe post Kevin Johnson Entered a Church to Pray Before Guarding Michael Jordan in the NBA Finals appeared first on The SportsRush.",

However, wide receiver Kayshon Boutte believes New England missed out on numerous opportunities throughout the game.\n\n“I said they played well, I wouldn’t discredit that,” Boutte said on Sunday after a reporter asked what made Seattle’s defense so good. “But I think as an offense we left opportunities out there too, as I said, they did everything we expected them to do, we just didn’t execute.”\n\nSeattle’s defense did an excellent job of keeping New England in check for most of the game, holding it scoreless until the fourth quarter.\n\nBoutte had a challenging night, finishing with just one catch on five targets for a total of 21 yards. A significant factor in Boutte’s struggles was quarterback Drake Maye, who also had a difficult game, turning the ball over three times — two interceptions and a fumble.\n\nNew England’s offensive line also played a significant role in the offense’s inability to move the ball, leading to Maye being sacked six times.\n\nThe Patriots struggled to find their rhythm until late in the game, but by then, they were too far behind on the scoreboard to mount a comeback.\n\nPatriots, Celtics Meet Same Fate On Super Bowl Sunday",

    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nBad Bunny piles on Puerto Rican patriotism at Super Bowl half-time show\n\nWhat is ICE and what powers do its agents have to use force?\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "The Seattle Seahawks defeated the New England Patriots 29-7 in Super Bowl LX. MVP Kenneth Walker III leads the record EIGHT Studs from tonight!",
    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks just won the Super Bowl!\n\nThey defeated the New England Patriots 29-7 in Super Bowl LX to claim their second Lombardi Trophy as a franchise. There's so much to be happy about, but none more than the blessing of watching this team this season. We have an entire offseason to break it down, but for now and for the last time this season...\n\nHere are your Studs and Duds for the Super Bowl LX!\n\nKenneth Walker III rushed for 135 yards on 27 carries (averaging 5.0 YPC) and won Super Bowl MVP. He added 26 receiving yards, too, but his biggest asset to the team was being the only offensive force that consistently instilled fear in either defense the entire night. There’s no Seahawk who saw their stock increase so dramatically this postseason – or in any ever, for that matter.\n\nDevon Witherspoon had a case for Super Bowl MVP himself. He had four tackles, a sack, a tackle for loss, and forced Uchenna Nwosu’s pick-six. His blitz usage was the difference in the game on defense, and will go down in the history books as one of the most versatile adjustments a player has ever been able to make in a game of this magnitude.\n\nDerick Hall had two sacks, two tackles for loss, a forced fumble, and two tackles. He became the matchup of the night on Patriots rookie left tackle Will Campbell and won in dramatic fashion. He woke up today viewed as a rotational player, and ended a franchise legend tonight. By matching his entire regular season sack total in the Super Bowl, he literall saved it for when it counted most.\n\nUchenna Nwosu will finally go down in Seahawks lore as his consistent force of work ought to. His 45-yard pick six capped off a massively under-appreciated season with one of the biggest defensive plays in the history of the organization. He didn’t get a single tackle, sack or tackle for loss, but it does not matter– because he played his role on this incredibly deep team by coming up in the clutch in the big moment when it was needed most.\n\nBoth Jason Myers and Michael Dickson had all-time performances in the kicking game tonight. Myers set a record for kicker points in a Super Bowl with 17, going 5/5 on field goals and 2/2 on extra points. Dickson averaged 47.9 yards per punt (335 total yards on 7 punts) and gave Seattle a field-position security blanket in the defensive battle that moved the needle more than any single-game punting performance in recent memory.\n\nAt just 38 years old, Mike Macdonald became the third youngest head coach to ever win a Super Bowl, and also the first defensive play-calling one. He refused to lift the Lombardi trophy without his players doing so at the same time as well, which sums up his selflessness as well as possible. Mike Vrabel might’ve won Coach of the Year, but if one were to power rank the NFL head coaches right now, he would undoubtedly be number one.\n\nByron Murphy II was the sleeper MVP of the night. He had two sacks, two tackles for loss, and consistently reset the line of scrimmage. He was the best lineman on either team tonight. In just his second year, there’s truly no limit to what his career trajectory can look like after becoming a Super Bowl Champion in his second year- and dominating on the biggest stage, at that.\n\nThe 12s were PHENOMENAL tonight, as they were all season long. They set the tone before kickoff and during every snap by drowning the entire stadium out with chants of “SEA… HAWKS!” Throughout the whole game. Coach Macdonald’s motto of 12 as one represents the rebirth that has taken place in the Pacific Northwest's football fanbase, who hold the most revered fan tradition in the NFL.\n\nThe Seahawks defense only allowed 23 rushing yards to Rhamondre Stevenson, meaning they finished the entire season- 20 total games- without allowing a 100-yard rusher. Their streak extends to 29 straight games dating back to last season. Truly mind-boggling… while the Patriots defense honed in on Jaxon Smith-Njigba and held him quiet, Cooper Kupp led the team with 61 receiving yards… JSN soaked up all the attention and allowed his teammates to thrive so he could get his first ring… AJ Barner scored the Seahawks only offensive touchdown, routing up another safety on a corner route to do so in a huge moment, just like the Rams game in Week 16… and as Mike Macdonald says, it's not just about the 53, but the entire 70. From the entire roster to the practice squad, everyone on the Seahawks just earned a Super Bowl Ring that they'll cherish for the rest of their lives.\n\nThe game was close for the majority, so of course, there were a few duds. Cornerbacks Josh Jobe and Tariq Woolen lost it on consecutive plays, beginning with Jobe throwing an open-hand punch at Stefon Diggs, followed immediately by Mack Hollins dominating Tariq Woolen for 24- and 35-yards plus a touchdown on two consecutive plays. There were plenty of other areas for improvement- if the Seahawks thought they were perfect, they would never have got there in the first place. However, we at Seahawks Wire will be talking about that ALL offseason, every single day- for now, it’s time to celebrate, if it ever was!\n\nThis article originally appeared on Seahawks Wire: Seahawks Super Bowl LX: Studs and Duds from the championship win",

    "description": "Drake Maye was the second-youngest QB to start a Super Bowl. Now he's the second-youngest QB to lose a Super Bowl. Here's why a shaky debut in the big game may not bode well for Maye's future.",
    "fullText": "Is Drake Maye the next Dan Marino or Joe Burrow? How rough Super Bowl 60 changes narrative for Patriots QB originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nDrake Maye became the second-youngest quarterback to start a Super Bowl when he faced the Seahawks in Super Bowl 60. Unfortunately, after a 29-13 setback in which he struggled against Seattle's defense, Maye, 23, is now also the second-youngest QB to lose a Super Bowl.\n\nHall of Famer Dan Marino was also 23 when he led the Dolphins to defeat in Super Bowl 19, a 38-16 loss to Joe Montana and the 49ers. Like Maye, he was in his second season. Marino was the MVP in the 1984 regular season before the playoffs, while Maye was the MVP runner-up in 2025.\n\nWith Marino emerging as an all-time great passer quickly, it was expected he would return to the Super Bowl at least once—and maybe several times—to give Montana a natural big-game rival. Instead, Marino played 15 more seasons and never won another AFC championship with Miami.\n\nBad Bunny halftime show reviews\n\nWinners and losers from Super Bowl 60\n\nKenneth Walker ends 28-year RB MVP drought\n\nSeahawks Super Bowl parade details\n\nBest and worst Super Bowl commercials in 2026\n\nMeanwhile, Ben Roethlisberger was 23 on the Steelers team that won Super Bowl 40 over the Seahawks. He went on to win a second ring in Super Bowl 44.\n\nSo the question is: Does the loss to the Seahawks set up Maye for another “tough no-ring” scenario, or can the Patriots count on returning to the Super Bowl with him at quarterback?\n\nIt’s hard to say now, but let’s consider the other second-year QBs who joined Maye, Marino, and Roethlisberger in starting a Super Bowl.\n\nKurt Warner was the first to win, with the 1999 Rams in Super Bowl 34. Then came Tom Brady, whose Patriots upset Warner’s Rams two years later in Super Bowl 36. The other second-year winner was Russell Wilson, who led the 2013 Seahawks to victory in Super Bowl 48.\n\nUnfortunately, Maye now joins Marino, Colin Kaepernick, Joe Burrow, and Brock Purdy-- fellow second-year QBs who lost their first Super Bowl trips. Excluding the two 49ers, who lost close games, Maye most closely resembles Marino and Burrow.\n\nBurrow’s Bengals lost Super Bowl 56 to the Rams, 23-20, and were hammered by the defense. He faced Aaron Donald and the Rams’ pass rush, which tied a Super Bowl record with seven sacks -- Donald and Super Bowl 50 MVP Von Miller had two each.\n\nMaye was sacked six times by the Seahawks. He also threw a pick-six as part of two interceptions and lost a fumble under pressure. Likewise, Marino was sacked four times by the 49ers and threw two interceptions.\n\nMORE: Why Drake Maye's legacy won't be defined by Super Bowl 60 flop\n\nBurrow is still active, giving him a chance for a Super Bowl return. But repeated punishment and a combination of offensive line and defensive shortcomings have limited his championship prospects.\n\nThe Patriots, on paper, appear poised to remain long-term AFC contenders with Maye at QB and Mike Vrabel as head coach. But nothing is guaranteed in the NFL—New England should know this after going from 3-14 to 14-3 in just one year. Fortune can be fleeting.\n\nMaye will enter his third season on his rookie deal, meaning the clock is ticking before the No. 3 overall pick of 2024 earns a lucrative long-term extension—a second contract that could restrict signing and retaining free agents while staying under the salary cap. Burrow’s extension handcuffed the Bengals’ ability to surround him with talent, particularly at wide receiver.\n\nMarino signed an extension in 1986, three years after being drafted and less than two years after losing the Super Bowl. The Dolphins made him the league’s highest-paid player both times, limiting spending elsewhere.\n\nGoing into Super Bowl 60, there was talk of Maye channeling a second-year Brady and launching another Patriots dynasty with Vrabel coaching instead of Belichick. Now, Maye’s brutal loss casts doubt on that plan, given his struggles against tougher defenses leading up to the Seahawks.\n\nMORE: Was Drake Maye's effort against Seattle one of the worst QB performances in Super Bowl history?\n\nMaye also had the chance to emerge as the AFC’s consistent challenger to Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs, potentially winning a Super Bowl before Burrow, Josh Allen, or Lamar Jackson. This past season was unusual, with Mahomes and Jackson absent from the playoffs. Concerns remain that Maye’s strong stats came against a favorable schedule, and he may regress in Year 3.\n\nIn 2021, before Burrow led the Bengals to the Super Bowl, he led the league in completion percentage (70.4) and yards per pass attempt (8.9), but was sacked a league-high 51 times. In 2025, Maye also led the league in completion percentage (72.0) and yards per attempt (8.9) and was sacked 47 times -- foreshadowing the 21 sacks he endured in just four playoff games through Super Bowl 60.\n\nNew England likely will improve pass protection, but Maye’s tendency to extend plays with his athleticism may always lead to a high sack rate.=\n\nWarner, Brady, Wilson, and Roethlisberger were unflappable in their first Super Bowls as second-year QBs. Maye did not show that same composure, even compared with Burrow and Marino.\n\nThe Super Bowl and preceding playoffs are a different beast than the regular season. Ask Allen and Jackson -- two recent non-Mahomes MVPs—who failed to reach the Super Bowl despite Hall of Fame credentials. Four-time MVP Aaron Rodgers is running out of time to earn a second ring. Cam Newton, Matt Ryan, and Matthew Stafford had their chances once -- and that was it.\n\nMORE: Drake Maye gets emotional following Super Bowl 60 loss\n\nWinning a Super Bowl as a top passer is difficult, which makes one appreciate Brady, Mahomes, and Montana all the more for executing in clutch playoff moments.\n\nThe 23-year-old Maye has time on his side -- but so did Marino, and so did Burrow, who four years later is still chasing his first ring.\n\nThis is a great QB era. The AFC is loaded with elite passers and high-potential stars. Unfortunately, history suggests Maye is more likely to follow the path of Marino or Burrow than become the next Brady or Mahomes.",

    "fullText": "Patriots coach Mike Vrabel shared his “disappointed” reaction after a heartbreaking Super Bowl loss. The New England Patriots battled it out on the field against the Seattle Seahawks on February 8. Notably, the Seahawks defeated the Patriots 29–13. Unsurprisingly, Patriots coach Vrabel isn’t pleased with his team’s performance on the field.\n\nPatriots coach Mike Vrabel is understandably “disappointed” after the Super Bowl loss. Notably, Vrabel took over an underperforming team and led them to a remarkable 14‑3 regular-season record before winning three playoff games to reach the Super Bowl.\n\nFans who watched the game would acknowledge that the Patriots did not deliver their best against the Seahawks. Vrabel, without mincing any words, stated, “Disappointed. I reminded them that we’re 307 days into what hopefully is a long, successful relationship and program” (via Patriots. com).\n\nContinuing further, he shared, “It’s OK to be disappointed. We have to be disappointed and upset together. . . . Every year, somebody’s going to lose this game. We have to remember what it feels like and make sure it’s not repeatable.”\n\nPatriots’ long-term fans believe the team wasn’t up to the mark in yesterday’s game and barely performed to their potential. However, coach Vrabel is proud of the team’s efforts and believes their performance in yesterday’s match was not an accurate “reflection of our year.” Vrabel also added that making this kind of jump in their first year together “wasn’t very valuable.”\n\nMoreover, the 50-year-old believes the heartbreaking loss is the entire team’s responsibility, and the onus isn’t on any single player.\n\nVrabel remarked, “We can sit here and try to put it all on one guy. You’ll be disappointed cause that’ll never happen. It starts with us as the coaching staff, making sure that we’re doing our part. Obviously, we have to be able to execute. We’ve gotta be able to protect, and when we do protect, we have to be able to progress through and throw to guys open and help the quarterback, and then he’s gotta be better. That’s just how it goes.”\n\nThe post Patriots’ Coach Mike Vrabel ‘Disappointed’ After Super Bowl Loss appeared first on Mandatory.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United will travel to face West Ham United tomorrow evening following a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur.\n\nThe Red Devils have played the Hammers 157 times in their history, winning 74 matches.\n\nWest Ham have won 50 matches, and there have been 33 draws between the two sides.\n\nHere are three storylines to look forward to.\n\nManchester United struggled against most sides last season as they slumped to a 15th-place finish in the league.\n\nThe BBC reports, “West Ham did the double over Manchester United last season, and drew 1-1 at Old Trafford in the reverse fixture this season.”\n\nIn addition, “only once have they avoided defeat in both league meetings with the Red Devils in consecutive campaigns, doing so in 1932-33/1933-34.”\n\nThe Red Devils have also lost four of their last six matches against the Hammers.\n\n“Having lost two of their first three Premier League away games this season, Manchester United have now lost just one of their last nine on the road (winning four and drawing four).\n\nMore specifically, they have also won their last two league games away at London sides.\n\nThe Red Devils have not won three times in a row in the capital in the same season since January/February 2019.\n\nThere is no doubt that United’s increased competency on the road has been a significant factor in their much improved Premier League results this season.\n\nThe Brazilian has been one of the best signings in the league this season.\n\nAlongside Bryan Mbeumo, he has completely transformed United’s attack and has scored against Arsenal and Fulham in recent matches.\n\nThe BBC reports that, “Matheus Cunha has had a hand in four goals in his last five away Premier League appearances for Manchester United (three goals, one assist).”\n\nSurprisingly, though, he has never scored in five Premier League games versus the Hammers, only facing Manchester City more without scoring (six matches).\n\nHe will certainly be looking to rectify this on Tuesday night.\n\nFeatured image Matt McNulty via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks produced a devastating defensive display to beat the New England Patriots and claim their second Super Bowl victory.\n\nTwo of the NFL's strongest defences battled it out in Sunday's showpiece and the Seahawks emphatically came out on top to win 29-13 at Levi's Stadium in.\n\nIt was a defensive performance for the ages and Briton Aden Durde played a pivotal role, becoming the first overseas coach to win the Unites States' biggest game.\n\nSeattle's 46-year-old defensive co-ordinator has helped create the most feared defence in the NFL, which has become known as 'the Dark Side', and they showed why on American football's biggest stage in Santa Clara, California.\n\nNew England's second-year quarterback Drake Maye narrowly missed out on this season's Most Valuable Player (MVP) award but was stifled by the Seahawks, who claimed six sacks, forced three turnovers and scored a defensive touchdown.\n\nAfter Seattle led 9-0 at half-time, Maye's first turnover resulted in the game's opening touchdown for tight end AJ Barner early in the fourth quarter.\n\nLinebacker Uchenna Nwosu then returned an interception for a 45-yard touchdown, while Jason Meyers kicked a record five field goals as Seattle denied the Patriots a record seventh Super Bowl win.\n\n\"We were the better team; we're the best team. We loved each other, we believed in each other and now we're champions,\" Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald told NBC.\n\n\"We went to the dark side tonight. We love our players - they made it happen. They made it come to life.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nMost of the 70,823 crowd seemed to favour Seattle, who came into the game as narrow favourites, and their win also means quarterback Sam Darnold completed his redemption story after being written off as a starting NFL quarterback.\n\nThe Seahawks are Darnold's fifth team in his eight-year career - and third in three years - but in his first year in Seattle the former third overall draft pick has won the game's biggest prize.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been haunted by a comment he made as he struggled in a game against the Patriots in 2019, when he said \"I'm seeing ghosts\", but Darnold has now exorcised those demons.\n\nInstead, it was Maye who suffered a nightmare when confronted with the fast, physical defence that Durde and coach Macdonald have fashioned in their two seasons together in Seattle.\n\nSuch is the breadth and depth of the threat it carries that Devon Witherspoon claimed a sack from cornerback. He, Derick Hall and Rylie Mills only registered 2.5 sacks between them all season but all three got to Maye in the first half.\n\nThe Patriots earned only four first downs before the interval and 52 yards in total. Some cruel folks on social media even joked that Bad Bunny gained more yards as he carried a ball during his half-time show.\n\nHall's second sack forced a fumble which was recovered by Byron Murphy, who also sacked Maye twice as the Dark Side wrote themselves into Seattle folklore alongside the 'Legion of Boom', the defence that led the Seahawks to their previous Super Bowl win in 2014.\n\n\"My team-mates and my coaches, they believed in me,\" Darnold told NBC.\n\n\"Since the first training camp, every single day we came to work. Shout-out to our offensive line for everything they did in the game. But I've also got to shout out our defence.\n\n\"We did it. It's been such a special journey with these guys. So much hard work has been out into this and we did it.\"\n\nNew England were playing in their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick.\n\nThe duo led the Patriots to six Super Bowl wins, tying the NFL record with the Pittsburgh Steelers, with Mike Vrabel playing in three of those wins.\n\nAfter two 4-13 seasons, the former linebacker returned to New England as head coach and has rebuilt the roster, leading the Patriots to a record-extending 12th Super Bowl appearance.\n\nVrabel was hoping to become the first man to win a Super Bowl as a player and head coach with the same franchise, while Maye aimed to be the youngest quarterback to win the big game.\n\nAs well as having the league's best pass completion rate this season, Maye has impressed with his ability to scramble and escape the pressure.\n\nThere was no getting away from the Seahawks, though, as New England were unable to get their run game going or get star receiver Stefon Diggs into the game.\n\nMaye did give the Patriots hope as he found Mack Hollins for a touchdown to cut the score to 19-7, but he was intercepted on their next two possessions, meaning Rhamondre Stevenson's late score was a consolation.\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSeahawks linebacker Ernest Jones IV is not going to let anyone disrespect what they accomplished on Sunday.\n\nThe first and most notable hater was Rams receiver Puka Nacua who posted on X “Sam Darnold” with laugh/crying emoji amid the Seahawks blowout of the Patriots in Super Bowl 60.\n\nRams are NFC West division rivals with the Seahawks.

Darnold didn’t have a perfect game but also didn’t turn the ball over.  Jones, the signal-caller of the defense, had a team-high 11 tackles on Sunday.\n\nIn Nacua’s defense, he did post in support of former teammate Cooper Kupp for winning his second ring. The star receiver is coming off a career year – a league high 129 catches for 1,715 receiving yards and 10 touchdowns.\n\nAnd Darnold will likely face some skeptics his entire career because of how terrible his time with the New York Jets was during his initial years in the league.

    "fullText": "Through the 2024-25 season, the Los Angeles Lakers have had a total of 506 players suit up for them, going back to their days in Minneapolis. Some were forgettable, some were serviceable, some were good and a select few were flat-out legendary.\n\nDuring the Lakers' 80th season of existence (they were founded back in 1946 as the Detroit Gems in the National Basketball League), LeBron Wire is taking a look at each player who has worn their jersey, whether it has been a purple and gold one or the ones they donned back in the Midwest during their early years.\n\nStu Lantz, a 6-foot-3 guard, starred at the University of Nebraska before being taken in the 1968 NBA Draft by the San Diego Rockets. His best season came during the 1970-71 campaign, when he averaged 20.6 points, five rebounds and 4.2 assists a game.\n\nHe was traded to the Lakers during the 1974-75 season and stayed with them through the following season, which was his last in the NBA. He retired with career averages of 12.4 points, 3.3 rebounds and 2.9 assists a game, including averages of 7.1 points, 2.5 rebounds and 2.1 assists in 20.9 minutes per game with Los Angeles.\n\nLantz, of course, is best known as the Lakers' longtime television color commentator. He started in that role in the fall of 1987 and worked alongside legendary play-by-play man Chick Hearn until Hearn's death in 2002. Today, Lantz works alongside Bill Macdonald, who has been the Lakers' television play-by-play man since the 2011-12 campaign.\n\nThis article originally appeared on LeBron Wire: Lakers jersey history No. 23 — Stu Lantz",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s summer rebuild is already taking shape and, as reported by The Telegraph, Sandro Tonali has surged high on the club’s shortlist to replace Casemiro. It is a signal of intent from Old Trafford, a move that would blend long term planning with immediate competitive ambition.\n\nUnited’s need is obvious. Casemiro’s confirmed summer departure removes not only experience but also tactical security from the engine room. For a side still searching for rhythm, control, and authority in central areas, recruitment here will define the next phase of the project.\n\nTonali, 25, represents both pedigree and Premier League adaptation, a rare combination in a volatile market.\n\nUnited’s interest in Tonali sits within a broader scouting framework. Elliot Anderson and Adam Wharton are also under consideration, while previous inquiries into Brighton’s Carlos Baleba underline the club’s desire for athletic, progressive midfielders.\n\nYet Tonali’s profile stands apart.\n\nThree seasons in England have hardened his tactical awareness. Newcastle’s £55m investment in 2023 now looks modest in an era where Enzo Fernández, Moisés Caicedo and Declan Rice all commanded fees beyond £100m. Newcastle would expect similar territory for Tonali, particularly given his contract running to 2029.\n\nThere is risk attached, notably his betting ban earlier in his Premier League spell, but United appear focused on the footballer rather than the controversy.\n\nTransfer narratives rarely ignite without agent intervention and Giuseppe Riso’s remarks have ensured this story gathers pace.\n\n“Newcastle are having a hard time letting go of Sandro, and he wants to lead the club to the Champions League,” Riso said.\n\nHe added, “We’ll evaluate and decide what to do in the summer. These transfer discussions will take place later. We’ll see how the season ends and then we’ll decide what to do.”\n\nPerhaps most telling was the ambiguity, “There’s no preference. It’s still early. What we’re saying today won’t apply tomorrow.”\n\nSuch language keeps every elite suitor engaged, Juventus, Manchester City, Arsenal, and now United most prominently.\n\nEuropean qualification may ultimately shape Tonali’s future. Newcastle sit 12th in the Premier League and face Qarabag in a Champions League play off, their route back to the competition remains uncertain.\n\nRiso acknowledged the emotional tie, stating, “Newcastle couldn’t let him go now, and there’s no point moving, especially since Sandro is very attached to the club.”\n\nAttachment, though, often bends under competitive gravity. Tonali wants Champions League football. United believe they can offer it, or at least return to it swiftly.\n\nFrom a strategic lens, this pursuit feels calculated. Tonali is entering his peak years, already Premier League tested, tactically disciplined, and technically secure under pressure. He would not merely replace Casemiro, he would recalibrate United’s midfield identity.\n\nFrom a Manchester United supporter’s perspective, this report lands somewhere between excitement and caution.\n\nTonali is undeniably elite. His tempo control, positional intelligence, and ability to dictate transitions would address long standing midfield imbalances. United have too often lacked composure in high leverage matches, particularly against top six rivals. Tonali would change that dynamic.\n\nYet £100m territory demands scrutiny. Fans will remember recent midfield spending sprees across the league and question value versus urgency. Is Tonali transformative, or simply premium stabilisation.\n\nThere is also squad context. When Casemiro departs, United require not one midfielder but two, possibly three, depending on outgoings. Investing heavily in a single profile could restrict broader rebuild flexibility.\n\nStill, the upside is compelling. Tonali offers leadership without theatrics, control without slowing play, and durability in England’s most demanding fixtures.\n\nIf United are serious about restoring midfield authority, this is the calibre required. The question is not quality, it is whether the club can align finance, Champions League qualification, and long term squad architecture around one decisive signing.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool will soon need to replace their club legend and a 21-year-old super talent could do it.\n\nIt's a time of metamorphosis at Anfield. Liverpool are in the middle of replacing the old icons who helped the club reach its pinnacle and bring in new stars who can take the baton from them and continue the success.\n\nWe've already seen the likes of Sadio Mane, Roberto Firmino and Trent Alexander-Arnold depart.\n\nBut their exodus was just the beginning. Mo Salah is likely going to depart in the summer and he will be followed shortly by Virgil van Dijk and Alisson Becker.\n\nEveryone is focusing on replacements for Van Dijk and Salah at the moment, so Alisson has gone under the radar.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nSure, Liverpool have Giorgi Mamardashvili who seems like an ideal successor. However, Liverpool may need more depth than that.\n\nMamardashvili is a competent back-up but can he be trusted to be the no.1? Or perhaps Liverpool should have two no.1s instead competing for the same spot?\n\nAfter Alisson's departure, the latter makes the most sense. Mamardashvili is still young for a goalkeeper and he may benefit from added competition and working alongside someone who is just as eager and hungry to oust him from the no.1 spot.\n\nRight now, Alisson's contract expires in the summer of 2026. The club has an option to extend the deal until 2027, and they likely will.\n\nSo, we don't have to worry about replacing the Brazilian just yet. Unless, Liverpool decide to surprise us all and let Alisson either leave on a free or for a fee if they extend his contract.\n\nThere have been times when it felt like Alisson has been open to returning to Brazil so it is something to keep an eye on.\n\nFortunately, Liverpool are well-placed to find his successor. The club has an excellent track-record with goalkeepers and right now there is an outstanding young super talent in Europe's top five leagues who seems like he could be the perfect successor to Alisson's throne.\n\nLet us introduce you to RC Lens' 21-year-old goalkeeper Robin Risser. The France U21 international has been ever-present in a side going toe to toe with Paris Saint Germain in Ligue 1 this season.\n\nHe's played a key role in Lens' success.\n\nCurrently, Risser has prevented 4.56 goals in Ligue 1, which is the second highest among goalkeepers in the competition in the current campaign.\n\nHe also has a save rate of 77%, which is the third highest among goalkeepers.\n\nRisser does exactly what you ask from a goalkeeper. He prevents goals and makes important stops. But there's more to him than that.\n\nHe is very similar to Alisson in terms of his ability to come off his line. Risser is fast and he's very good in one vs one situations, meaning even when his defence exposes him, he can prevent the opposition from scoring.\n\nAt 21-years-old, he's still extremely young for a goalkeeper, but he is absolutely one of the brightest talents out there in European football at the moment.\n\nRisser's ability to come out and smother opposition attackers makes him the ideal and inevitable Alisson heir.\n\nIt won't be easy for anyone to live up to the Brazilian's reputation. Alisson is a club legend for everything that he achieved at Anfield. However, if anyone can do it, it's Risser.\n\nKeep an eye out on this potential move.",

    "description": "From compact ‘desktops’ to purpose-built blades, welcome to a new wave of dedicated 1:1 datacentre-ready workstations",
    "fullText": "For more than a decade, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) and cloud workstations have promised flexible, centrally managed workstation resources for design and engineering teams that use CAD, BIM and other 3D software. But a parallel trend is now gathering serious momentum: the rise of the 1:1 remote workstation.\n\nIn a 1:1 model, each user gets remote access to a dedicated physical workstation with its own CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no resource sharing, no slicing of processors, and no contention with other users.\n\nIn many ways, it combines the performance predictability of a local desktop workstation with many of the management, security and centralised data benefits traditionally associated with VDI.\n\nThis shift is being driven by performance demands, changing IT priorities, and the growing maturity of remote access technologies. And it is appearing in several distinct forms. What is a 1:1 remote workstation?\n\nUnlike VDI or public cloud environments like AWS or Microsoft Azure, where multiple users typically share CPUs and GPUs through virtualisation, a 1:1 remote workstation assigns an entire machine to a single user. That machine typically sits in racks in a dedicated server room or datacentre, either on-premise or hosted by a third-party service provider. However, it could also sit under a desk, or in the corner of an office.\n\nThe user accesses the workstation remotely using high-performance display protocols such as Mechdyne TGX, PCoIP (HP Anyware), NICE DCV (now Amazon DCV), Parsec or Citrix HDX. However, from a compute perspective, it behaves exactly like a local workstation.\n\nOne of the most visible indicators of the 1:1 trend, especially for design and engineering teams that use CAD and BIM software, is the relocation of compact desktop workstations into the datacentre.\n\nMachines such as the HP Z2 Mini and Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF are increasingly being mounted in racks rather than sitting on desks. Thanks to their small form factors, these systems offer impressive density. With the ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, for example, seven individual workstations can be housed in a 5U chassis.\n\nDensity matters for several reasons. Higher density reduces rack space requirements, lowers hosting costs, and improves energy efficiency per user.\n\nCrucially, these are still true desktop workstations. Users get the same CPU frequencies, GPU options and application performance they would expect from a machine under their desk. Remote management and access capabilities are typically added via specialist add-in cards, enabling IT teams to control and maintain systems centrally.\n\nCompact desktop workstations do have their limitations. While they can offer the highest-frequency CPUs — capable of boosting into Turbo for excellent performance in single-threaded CAD and BIM applications such as Solidworks and Autodesk Revit — they are typically restricted to low-profile GPUs or integrated graphics.\n\nIn the past, this confined them largely to traditional CAD and BIM workflows. However, the latest compact models are surprisingly capable, with models including the Nvidia RTX 4000 SFF Ada and Nvidia RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell SFF, having enough graphics horsepower and GPU memory to comfortably handle mainstream visualisation workflows in applications such as Enscape, Twinmotion, KeyShot and Solidworks Visualize.\n\nWhile GPU sharing is rarely a major issue for day-to-day CAD and BIM work, it becomes critical for visualisation and rendering workflows, where the GPU may be driven at 100% utilisation for extended periods\n\nFor more demanding users, high-end desktop tower workstations with high core count CPUs, lots of memory, and one or more exceedingly powerful full height professional GPUs, can also be racked, extending the adapted desktop model to advanced visualisation, simulation and AI workflows. However, achievable density is massively reduced.\n\nThe major workstation players – Dell, HP and Lenovo – design most of their tower systems to be rack mountable, as does Boxx. However, that’s not the case for all systems, especially custom manufacturers that often use consumer gaming chassis.\n\nAnother strand of the trend is the resurgence of the purpose-built workstation blade, a form factor first pioneered by HP in the early 2000s. Each blade is a slender, self-contained 1:1 workstation with its own CPU, GPU, memory, and storage, engineered specifically for deployment in the datacentre.\n\nIn 2025, new systems have arrived from Amulet Hotkey, while Computle has gone one step further, launching a workstation-as-a-service offering built around its own dedicated blade hardware. Established players such as Boxx and ClearCube also continue to offer blade-based workstation platforms.\n\nBlades provide a clean, highly modular approach to workstation deployment. The density is impressive with typically around 10 blades slotting into 5U or 6U chassis. Blades also integrate neatly into existing datacentre infrastructure, relying on centralised and redundant power, which simplifies cabling and makes them inherently well suited to remote-access scenarios.\n\nFrom a performance perspective, blades are ideal for CAD and BIM workflows, commonly featuring high frequency CPUs and single slot pro GPUs. However, some blades can also support full height, dual slot GPUs, which can push graphics performance into the realms of high-end visualisation, beyond that of the compact desktop workstation.\n\nFor organisations standardising on remote-first workflows, blades represent a highly engineered interpretation of the 1:1 workstation concept.\n\nSitting alongside blades are 1U, 2U, and 4U rack-mounted workstations, purpose-built, single-user workstations designed specifically for racks. The ultra-slim 1U systems are sometimes called “pizza boxes”.\n\nRack workstations appeal to organisations seeking maximum performance, full-size professional GPUs, and good integration with existing server infrastructure — without the need for a blade chassis. Like other 1:1 approaches, they deliver predictable, dedicated performance while avoiding the complexity of heavy virtualisation.\n\nThe downside of rack workstations is their low density—particularly for CAD and BIM workflows, where the most suitable graphics cards are often small, entry-level models, leaving much of the large internal space unused.\n\nThere’s a tonne of firms that offer dedicated rack workstations, including PC Specialists, Armari, Novatech, G2 Digital, Exxact, Titan, ACnodes, BOXX, Puget Systems, and Supermicro. HP and Dell also have rack systems but these are now several years old and, presumably, being phased out in favour of small form factor workstations.\n\nThe strongest argument for 1:1 remote workstations is performance.\n\nEach user gets dedicated CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no noisy neighbour effect, no unexpected slowdowns because another user happens to be rendering or running a simulation.\n\nCPUs are typically Intel Core processors, which deliver very high clock frequencies and aggressive Turbo behaviour. This is especially important for CAD and BIM applications, which often rely on single-threaded or lightly threaded performance.\n\nIn contrast, VDI and cloud workstations rely on virtualised CPUs, where users receive a fraction of a processor. These virtualised environments often use server-class CPUs such as Intel Xeon or AMD Epyc, which prioritise core count over frequency. Even specialist CAD-focused VDI platforms based on AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro involve CPU virtualisation and typically do not allow the processor to go into Turbo.\n\nAnd frequency really matters for performance. Even simple tasks, such as opening a model or “syncing to central”, are significantly impacted by low CPU frequency. When working with huge models, this can create a major bottleneck, potentially taking hours of out of the working week.\n\nOn the GPU side, 1:1 systems avoid contention entirely. While GPU sharing is rarely a major issue for day-to-day CAD and BIM work, it becomes critical for visualisation and rendering workflows, where the GPU may be driven at 100% utilisation for extended periods. A dedicated GPU ensures consistent, predictable performance.\n\nThe strongest argument for 1:1 remote workstations is performance. Each user gets dedicated CPU, GPU, memory and storage. There is no noisy neighbour effect, no unexpected slowdowns because another user happens to be rendering or running a simulation\n\nThere’s also the matter of GPU memory to consider. A typical entry-level pro GPU for design viz, such as the Nvidia RTX 2000 Pro Blackwell, comes with 20 GB of memory. To get this amount in a VDI setup would be very expensive. And if you don’t have enough GPU memory to load or render a scene, performance can drop dramatically, or software can even crash.\n\nAs with VDI, organisations can choose where and how their 1:1 workstations are hosted.\n\nSome firms deploy systems on-premise, purchasing hardware from vendors such as HP, Lenovo, Amulet Hotkey, ClearCube and Boxx. Lenovo, in particular, is working to simplify deployment through its Lenovo Access Blueprints, which provide reference architectures and guidance.\n\nOthers opt for fully managed services, hosting dedicated workstations in third-party datacentres. Providers such as IMSCAD, Computle and Creative ITC deliver managed 1:1 workstation platforms, combining dedicated hardware with subscription-based services.\n\nInterestingly, neither HP nor Lenovo has gone so far as to offer their own workstation-as-a-service platforms directly. Instead, they prefer to work through specialist partners, allowing customers to choose between ownership and service-based consumption models.\n\nVDI’s greatest strength has always been flexibility: the ability to resize virtual machines and dynamically allocate CPU, GPU and memory resources.\n\nA 1:1 workstation is inherently more fixed. You cannot simply dial up more cores or memory on demand. However, organisations can still achieve flexibility by deploying a mixed portfolio of workstation configurations tailored to different user profiles.\n\nMany firms are also adopting hybrid strategies, combining VDI for lighter or more variable workloads with 1:1 remote workstations for power users who demand guaranteed performance.\n\nNot all solutions fit neatly into either camp. Service providers like Inevidesk occupy a middle ground: its vdesk solution virtualises a Threadripper Pro CPU shared among seven users, but each user receives a dedicated GPU.\n\nThis approach sacrifices some CPU predictability and frequency but ensures consistent GPU performance, making it attractive for demanding visualisation tools where GPU contention is the primary concern.\n\nInevidesk’s approach also offers good flexibility, with the option to quickly reallocate CPU and memory resources to different VMs or pool GPU resources at night for compute intensive workflows such as rendering or AI training.\n\nEnergy efficiency is often promoted as a key advantage of VDI, with vendors claiming it has a smaller carbon footprint than maintaining multiple 1:1 workstations. The logic is straightforward: instead of powering and cooling multiple processors, graphics cards, and power supplies, a single shared infrastructure can support many users.\n\nIf reducing energy consumption is a priority, it pays to examine the details. Some past carbon comparisons we’ve seen don’t hold up under closer scrutiny, based on maximum power draw rather than typical usage. However, a recent report commissioned by Inevidesk comparing its vdesk platform to a hosted 1:1 desktop workstation, takes a more measured approach and demonstrates tangible energy savings in practice.\n\nThat said, 1:1 workstation vendors are also taking energy consumption seriously. Amulet Hotkey, for example, offers lower energy laptop processors, HP has machines with the energy-efficient AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro processor with integrated graphics, and Computle is exploring ways to reduce energy use in its blade systems.\n\n1:1 workstations can also offer cost savings, but there are several factors to consider. On the hardware side, multiple entry-level GPUs — such as the Nvidia RTX A1000 — are often less expensive than a single high-end datacentre GPU used for VDI, like the Nvidia L40, though this depends on how many virtual machines you intend to support. This principle extends to more powerful GPUs as well: some vendors, such as Computle, provide gaming-focused GeForce GPUs instead of the more costly, passively cooled datacentre variants. On the other hand, 1:1 workstations require more individual components, including multiple motherboards, power supplies, fans, and in the case of adapted desktops, aesthetically-pleasing chassis that never see the light of day.\n\nThe software stack for 1:1 workstations is also more simple. There is no need for virtualisation software, and GPU licensing is straightforward. For example, slicing a GPU for VDI requires an Nvidia RTX Virtual Workstation (vWS) software license, whereas standard free Nvidia RTX drivers are sufficient for a 1:1 workstation.\n\nThere are many compelling reasons why design and engineering firms may favour 1:1 workstations over VDI, with performance chief among them. Time and again, we’ve heard of VDI proof-of-concept projects that fail due to user pushback, particularly when performance falls short of what designers and engineers expect from a CAD workstation. In some organisations, this has become a hard line: firms such as HOK, for example, have stated they will not consider cloud workstations / virtualised server CPUs because of the performance penalties associated with single-threaded workflows.\n\nThat’s not to say VDI doesn’t have its place. Its strengths lie in flexibility, centralised management, and, in the case of public cloud offerings, global availability at scale. But for organisations where performance, user satisfaction, and workflow continuity are paramount, 1:1 remote workstations remain a highly compelling choice for those making the move from desktop to datacentre.\n\nHP’s 1:1 remote workstation spotlight falls on the HP Z2 Mini, a tiny powerhouse that comes in two flavours.\n\nThe HP Z2 Mini G1i packs high frequency Intel Core Ultra CPUs with discrete Nvidia GPUs up to the powerful RTX 4000 SFF, while the HP Z2 Mini G1a runs on the AMD Ryzen AI Max Pro processor with integrated Radeon graphics (see review here). Thanks to its smaller processor package and integrated PSU, the G1a offers a slight advantage in terms of rack density, fitting five units in 4U, compared with six G1i units in 5U.\n\nLenovo’s 1:1 workstation offering centres on the ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, a compact system with a BMC card for ‘server-grade’ remote management (see review).\n\nConfigurable with Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPUs and Nvidia RTX GPUs up to the RTX 4000 SFF, it packs a punch for CAD and viz workflows while delivering good density with up to seven units in a 5U rack space. For even higher density, the ThinkStation P3 Tiny delivers twelve systems in 5U. However, the micro workstation is limited to CAD and BIM workflows, with a narrow range of GPUs up to the Nvidia RTX A1000.\n\nCompared with HP and Lenovo, Dell is much less vocal about its 1:1 remote workstation offering, which centres on the Dell Pro Max Micro desktop, which packs seven units into a 5U rack.\n\nUnlike the HP Z2 Mini G1i and Lenovo ThinkStation P3 Ultra SFF, which can be configured with 125W Intel Core Ultra 9 285K CPUs, the Dell Pro Max Micro is limited to the 65W Intel Core Ultra 9 285. However, this is unlikely to impact performance in single-threaded CAD and BIM workflows. GPU options include the Nvidia RTX A1000 for CAD and the RTX 4000 SFF Ada for visualisation workloads.\n\nAmulet Hotkey’s CoreStation HX is built for the datacentre combining redundant power and cooling with ‘full remote system management’ via a 5U enclosure that can accommodate up to 12 workstation nodes.\n\nThe CoreStation HX2000 is built around laptop processors, up to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285H and MXM GPUs up to the CAD-focused Nvidia RTX 2000 Ada.\n\nFor more demanding workflows, the upcoming CoreStation HX3000 will feature desktop processors up to the Intel Core Ultra 9 285K, paired with low-profile Nvidia RTX and Intel Arc Pro GPUs.\n\nComputle is a workstation-as-a-service offering powered by its own 1:1 custom blade workstations, which are purpose-built for the datacentre.\n\nCustomers can choose from four standard configurations centred on the Intel Core i7- 14700, with GPU options up to the Nvidia ‘Blackwell’ RTX 5090. For more flexibility, components can be mixed and matched, including the Intel Core i9-14900, AMD Ryzen 9 9950X, or Threadripper Pro processors. Professional GPU options include the CAD-focused Nvidia RTX A2000 and high-end RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell (96 GB).\n\nClearCube stands out for its extremely broad portfolio of 1:1 workstations that are purpose built for the datacentre.\n\nAt the heart of its range is the CAD Pro, a rack-dense system that fits ten blades in a 6U chassis. The CAD Pro can be configured with a choice of Intel Core CPUs and single-slot Nvidia GPUs, up to the viz-capable RTX Pro 4000 Blackwell, which is more powerful than the SFF variant found in compact 1:1 desktops. For higher end workloads, the CAD Elite line offers dedicated 1U and 2U rack workstations with GPUs up to the RTX Pro 6000 Blackwell Max-Q.\n\nBoxx Flexx is a datacentre– ready 1:1 workstation system, that can support up to ten 1G modules or five 2G modules (or all configurations in between) in a standard 5U rack enclosure.\n\nBoxx Flexx offers an enviable combination of density and performance, with the 1G modules offering liquid-cooled Intel Core Ultra (Series 2) CPUs and one double-width Nvidia GPU, while the 2G modules support two double-width GPUs.\n\nBoxx also offers BoxxCloud, a workstation-as-a-service solution where Flexx workstations are hosted in regional datacentres.\n\nInevidesk offers a VDI solution that has some characteristics of a 1:1 remote workstation. Each rack-mounted server or ‘pod’ can host up to seven GPUaccelerated virtual desktops called vdesks.\n\nThe Threadripper Pro CPU and memory is virtualised, but each vdesk gets a dedicated GPU, such as the Nvidia RTX 4000 Ada, for predictable graphics performance. Virtual processors and memory can be adjusted, while multiple GPUs can be assigned to a single vdesk to boost performance in GPU rendering or AI workflows.",

    "description": "Opinion: After decades in the trenches, this engineer is done with hype cycles",
    "fullText": "Opinion The real opponent of digital sovereignty is \"enterprise IT\" marketing, according to one Red Hat engineer who ranted entertainingly about the repeated waves of bullshit the industry hype cycle emits.\n\nDuring a coffee break at this year's CentOS Connect conference, The Reg FOSS desk paused for a chat with a developer who was surprised but happy to find us there. We won't name them – we're sure that they'd prefer to keep their job rather than enjoy a moment of fame – but we much enjoyed their pithy summary of how IT has faced repeated waves of corporate bullshit for at least 15 years now, and how they keenly and enthusiastically anticipate a large-scale financial collapse bursting the AI bubble.\n\nThis vulture has been working in the tech field for some 38 years now, and the Linux developer we spoke with has been in the business nearly as long. We both agreed that the late 20th century – broadly, the period from the early 1990s onward for a decade or so – had mostly been one of fairly steady improvement. Then, they suggested, roughly following the 2008 credit crunch, we've had some 15 years of bullshit in tech.\n\nThey called out about half a dozen particular instances of what they considered to be bullshit technology. We were too busy laughing sympathetically to whip out a laptop to make notes, but as best as we can recall the sequence, they were:\n\nAdding back some of the rather invective-laden commentary…\n\nContainers: Sure, yes, they work, they are handy for testing. But they aren't a deployment method. You shouldn't need them. Anything that you can run in a container, you can just run on the bare metal, and if you're not competent enough to get – and keep – that working, then you probably aren't competent enough to deploy a container either.\n\nKubernetes: If you don't need containers, then you don't need another vastly more complicated tool to deploy those containers. The chances are, you are not a vast multinational that must be able to withstand ten million potential new customers visiting your site all at once. It won't happen, so you won't lose any of that imaginary business.\n\n(This is sometimes known as the Use One Big Server approach, and in our humble opinion, it has great merit.)\n\nThe cloud: Nebulous by name and by nature. Who thought it was smart to take all your company's important data and hand it to some internet rando – probably the lowest bidder – trusting them to store the crown jewels, keep them safe, and never ever peek at them. If that sounds reasonable to you, maybe you should try selling homeopathy.\n\n(This can be summarized as There Is No Cloud – There's Just Somebody Else's Computer, and was being spelled out in clear language in 2015.)\n\nAnything \"as a service\" – it doesn't matter what: Infrastructure as a service – if you need servers, buy servers, or rent your own private servers. Nobody else will ever care as much about your servers as you will. Platform as a Service – now you don't even get servers, just OS instances. That's even worse. Software as a Service? Now you don't even know what the server is, or where it is, or what it's running; you don't get software, and you don't even know what data you have or how it's stored – you're paying for access to your own stuff.\n\n(The problems with this entire concept arguably go back to Peter Deutsch's Fallacies of Network Computing some 30 years ago.)\n\nThe blockchain, and anything built on the blockchain: the world's slowest and most-distributed database. Cryptocurrencies? Hashcash on the blockchain. NFTs – URL shorteners on the blockchain, only they're longer rather than shorter. Worthless. Web3? Get ripped off, as a service.\n\nWhich brings us round to \"generative AI\" or, as we prefer to term them, large language models, powered by the transformer algorithm. If The Financial Times can explain how it works to a banker in a couple of thousand words and a few minutes, it can't be that complicated or hard to understand, and it isn't. It's predictive text turned up to 11. It can't even count. As Daniel Stenberg, author of curl, caustically observed:\n\nThe \"i\" in \"LLM\" stands for intelligence.\n\n(This vulture laid out some of his case against it when Gentoo and NetBSD banned LLM bot slop in 2024.)\n\nHonestly, we can't fault any of this reasoning. We've looked into the chronological sequence of the waves of marketing drivel, and it's not quite how we expected. Although the earliest mention of Salesforce.com we can find on The Reg is from 2002, when we called it \"relatively new,\" it was founded in 1999. Perhaps the first mass SaaS offering to the general public was Google's Gmail in 2004.\n\nCloud computing in the sense of automatic creation and deployment of VMs arguably dates to Amazon taking Amazon Web Services live in 2002.\n\nWhoever \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" is or was, their paper [PDF] introducing Bitcoin was published in 2008, although it didn't come to The Reg's attention until 2011.\n\n2008 was also the year that the first version of LXC (you can still find version 0.1.0 on the downloads page) was released. Docker debuted in 2013 but your humble correspondent had predicted that Linux containers would be the Next Big Thing a couple of years earlier, back in 2011. We reckon we called it.\n\nKubernetes first appeared in 2014, although Google had been running \"Borg\" internally since around 2008. We still harbor a cynical suspicion that Mountain View threw it over the wall for no other reason than to distract the Penguinisti and keep them busy.\n\nSo in chronological order, those are:\n\n2002: Cloud computing goes mainstream with AWS\n\n2004: SaaS reaches the general public\n\n2008: LXC frees application containers from FreeBSD's Jail and brings them to Linux… and Bitcoin delivers full industrial-scale mass-production of the ancient scam of the pyramid scheme\n\n2014: Kubernetes is loosed upon an all-too-willing tech world\n\n2022: ChatGPT opens to the public, or as The Reg calls it, another AI to fill the world with kinda-true stuff\n\nAll right, yes, rather more than 15 years. \"A century of tech BS\" seems a bit over the top when it's only 2026, but it certainly feels that long.\n\nObviously there are many more potential candidates, but we thought this was an excellent top six. Some of the other contenders are more niche, from the eternally awful Jira to the project managers' religion of Agile. Which of your bêtes noires did we miss? ®",

    "title": "Russian officials are warning Putin that a financial crisis could arrive this summer, report says, while his war on Ukraine becomes too big to fail",
    "description": "\"Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail.\"",
    "fullText": "The Kremlin’s financial situation is becoming increasingly dire and could come to a head in a matter of months as oil revenue shrinks while President Vladimir Putin shows no intention of ending his war on Ukraine.\n\nRussian officials have been warning Putin with growing alarm that a financial crisis could hit by the summer, sources told the Washington Post. They pointed to weak oil revenue, which crashed by 50% in January from a year earlier, and a budget deficit that continues to widen, even after Putin hiked taxes on consumers.\n\nA Moscow business executive also told the Post that the crisis could arrive in “three or four months” amid spiraling inflation, adding that restaurants have been closing and thousands of workers are getting laid off.\n\nThe economic strains go back to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine four years ago. As sanctions took hold and Putin mobilized the economy for a prolonged war, a tight labor market and high inflation forced the central bank to keep interest rates high. Recent easing has failed to prevent spending declines in several consumer categories.\n\nWith companies feeling the squeeze of high rates and weaker consumption, more workers not being paid, getting furloughed, or seeing their hours cut. As a result, consumers are having trouble servicing their loans, raising concerns of a crash in the financial sector.\n\n“A banking crisis is possible,” a Russian official told the Washington Post in December on condition of anonymity. “A nonpayments crisis is possible. I don’t want to think about a continuation of the war or an escalation.”\n\nIn June, Russian banks raised red flags on a potential debt crisis as high interest rates weigh on borrowers’ ability to pay off loans. Also that month, the head of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs warned many companies were in “a pre-default situation.”\n\nThe Center for Macroeconomic Analysis and Short-Term Forecasting, a state-backed Russian think tank, said in December the country could face a banking crisis by October if loan troubles worsen and depositors pull out their funds, according to the Post.\n\n“The situation in the Russian economy has deteriorated markedly,” wrote Dmitry Belousov, head of the think tank, in a note seen by the Financial Times. “The economy has entered the brink of stagflation for the first time since early 2023.”\n\nRussia’s financial woes could become even more serious as Europe weighs additional sanctions on so-called shadow fleet tankers used to ship Moscow’s oil. That would add to recent U.S. penalties on Russian oil majors Rosneft and Lukoil.\n\nThe West’s tighter sanctions regime has forced Russia to offer steeper discounts on its crude exports, while the recent slide in global oil prices has already hurt its top revenue generator.\n\nDespite the worsening fiscal outlook, Moscow is still spending heavily on weapons and incentives to lure fresh recruits to the army. To cover revenue shortfalls, Russia has tapped its sovereign wealth fund, but that is running out now too.\n\nRussia has also suffered staggering losses on the battlefield, with an estimated 1.2 million killed or wounded since the war began. Last month, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said more than 30,000 Russian troops died in December alone—an average of 1,000 each day—to gain only minimal territory.\n\nAt the same time, European officials have pointed out that Russia is losing strategically, with Ukraine likely headed for EU membership, NATO growing larger after adding new member states, and Europe ramping up defense spending significantly.\n\n“So people are saying that Russia wants to continue the war because they want more territory—that’s rubbish,” Finnish President Alexander Stubb said last month at the World Economic Forum. “Russia has to continue the war because this war is too big for Putin to fail. When you add on to that the Russian economy is in shambles, which means they’re not going to be able to pay their soldiers which means zero growth, end of reserves, interest rates and inflation in double digits. So Putin cannot afford to end this war. This is my big worry.”\n\nIndeed, while Russia has engaged in on-again, off-again talks to end the war, it continues to bombard Ukraine with missiles and drones, targeting its energy infrastructure.\n\nRussian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials just ended two days of talks in Abu Dhabi with little progress reported. In comments released on Saturday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the U.S. wants the war to end by June and plans a fresh round of negotiations.\n\n“America proposed for the first time that the two negotiating teams—Ukraine and Russia—meet in the United States of America, probably in Miami, in a week. We confirmed our participation,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

So we need to bring ​it back.\"\n\n\"When we leave office my goal, for this administration, is 40% market share in leading-edge semiconductor ‌manufacturing.\"\n\nTaiwan and the U.S. reached a deal last month to lower tariffs on the island's exports to 15% from 20% and for Taiwan to increase its investment in the country.\n\nCheng said that there would be no relocation of Taiwan's science parks, but Taiwan was willing to share its experience in building an industry cluster and help the U.S. develop a similar environment.\n\nShe also said she was confident that Taiwan's semiconductor capacity - including existing, ⁠under construction and planned projects across advanced manufacturing, advanced packaging ​and the broader supply chain - would far exceed its investment ​in the U.S. or any other country.\n\nIn an interview on CNBC last month, Lutnick said his goal was to bring 40% of Taiwan's entire chip supply chain and production ‍to the U.S. He said ⁠that if this does not happen, tariffs on Taiwan would likely rise to 100%.",

    "fullText": "WELLINGTON, New Zealand (AP) — The man who killed 51 Muslim worshipers at two mosques in New Zealand’s deadliest mass shooting told an appeals court Monday that he felt forced to admit to the crimes because of “irrationality” due to harsh prison conditions, as he sought to have his guilty pleas discarded.\n\nA panel of three judges at the Court of Appeal in Wellington will hear five days of evidence about Brenton Tarrant’s claim that he was not fit to plead to the terrorism, murder and attempted murder charges he faced after the 2019 attack in the city of Christchurch. If his bid is successful, his case would return to court for a trial, which was averted in March 2020 when he admitted to the hate-fueled shooting.\n\nHe is also seeking to appeal his sentence of life without the chance of parole, which had never been imposed in New Zealand before. Tarrant’s evidence Monday about his mental state when he pleaded guilty was the first time he had spoken substantively in a public setting since he livestreamed the 2019 massacre on Facebook.\n\nShooter says he suffered “nervous exhaustion”\n\nThe Australian man, a self-declared white supremacist, migrated to New Zealand with a view to committing the massacre, which he planned in detail. He amassed a cache of semiautomatic weapons, took steps to avoid detection and wrote a lengthy manifesto before he drove from Dunedin to Christchurch in March 2019 and opened fire at two mosques.\n\nAlong with 51 people killed, the youngest a 3-year-old boy, dozens of others were severely wounded. The attack was considered one of New Zealand’s darkest days and institutions have sought to curb the spread of Tarrant’s message through legal orders and a ban on possession of his manifesto or video of the attack.\n\nMonday’s hearing took place under tight security constraints that severely limited who could view Tarrant’s evidence, which included some reporters and those hurt or bereaved in the massacre. Tarrant, who wore a white button-down shirt and black-rimmed glasses and had a shaved head, spoke on video from a white-walled room at Auckland Prison.\n\nAnswering questions from a Crown lawyer and from lawyers representing him, Tarrant, 35, said his mental health had deteriorated due to conditions in prison, where he was held in solitary confinement with limited reading material or contact with other prisoners.\n\nCrown lawyers say no evidence of serious mental illness\n\nCrown lawyer Barnaby Hawes suggested to Tarrant during questioning that the Australian man had other options. He could have requested a delay in his trial date on mental health grounds or could have proceeded to trial and defended himself, Hawes said.\n\nHawes also put to Tarrant that there was little evidence in the documentation of his behavior by mental health experts and prison staff that he was in any kind of serious mental crisis. Tarrant suggested that signs of mental illness he displayed hadn’t been recorded and that at times he had sought to mask them.\n\n“I was definitely doing everything possible to come across as confident, assured, mentally well,” he told the court. Tarrant’s behavior “reflected the political movement I’m a part of,” he added. “So I always wanted to put on the best front possible.”\n\nHe agreed that he had had access to legal advice throughout the court process. Tarrant’s current lawyers have been granted name suppression because they feared representing him would make them unsafe.\n\nThe appeal outcome is due later\n\nBids to appeal convictions or sentences in New Zealand must be made within 20 working days. Tarrant was about two years late in seeking an appeal, filing documents with the court in September 2022.\n\nHe told the court Monday that his bid had been late because he hadn’t had access to the information required to make it.\n\nThe hearing is due to run for the rest of the week but the judges are expected to release their decision at a later date. If they reject Tarrant’s attempt to have his guilty pleas discarded, a later hearing will focus on his bid to appeal his sentence.",

As he shoves the first loaves into the oven, a sweet, delicate aroma of fresh bread fills the space.\n\nWhat economic risks do energy attacks pose to Ukraine?\n\nHow are labor shortages impacting Ukrainian companies?\n\nHow are power outages affecting Ukrainian business operations?\n\nWhat additional costs are Ukrainian businesses facing during wartime?\n\nSeconds later the lights go out, the ovens switch off and darkness envelops the room. Kutsenko, 31, steps outside into the freezing night, switches on a large rectangular generator and the power kicks back in. It’s a pattern that will be repeated many times as the business struggles to keep working through the power outages caused by Russia’s bombing campaign on Ukraine's energy grid.\n\n“It’s now more than impossible to imagine a Ukrainian business operating without a generator,” said Olha Hrynchuk, the co-founder and head baker of Spelta.\n\nThe cost of purchasing and operating generators to overcome power outages is just one of many challenges facing Ukrainian businesses after nearly four years of war. Acute labor shortages due to mobilization and war-related migration, security risks, declining purchasing power and complicated logistics add to the pressure, officials say.\n\nHrynchuk, 28, opened the bakery 10 months after Russia launched its full-scale invasion in 2022. That winter was the first year Russia targeted Ukraine’s energy system. Hrynchuk says they barely know what it is to work under “normal” conditions, but have never faced the challenges they do now.\n\nProduction is entirely dependent on electricity and the generator burns about 700 hryvnias ($16) worth of fuel per hour.\n\n“We run on a generator for 10 to 12 hours a day. You have no fixed schedule — you have to adapt and refuel it at the same time,” Hrynchuk said.\n\nOlha Nasonova, 52, who is head of the Restaurants of Ukraine analytical center, says the industry is experiencing its most difficult period of the past 20 years.\n\nWhile businesses were prepared for electricity cuts, no one expected such a cold winter and it’s been especially tough for small cafés and family-run establishments, because they have the least financial resources.\n\nThe “Best Way to Cup” project, which has two venues and roasts and grinds its own coffee, is on the brink of permanent closure. Co-founder Yana Bilym, 33, who opened the cafe in May, said a Russian attack shattered all its windows and glass doors in August. Bilym said the cost of renovation was 150,000 hryvnias (about $3,400), half of which she financed with a bank loan that she only recently finished repaying.",

    "description": "Lack of a state floodplain policy in Texas enabled oil companies to build in areas hit by an epic inundation less than 30 years ago.",
    "fullText": "GONZALES - More than 500 enormous oil tanks dot the floodplains of the Guadalupe River and its tributaries across one of Texas' leading oil fields, posing risk of environmental disaster in a flood climatologists say is almost certain to come.\n\nLongtime residents of this area's historic ranchlands vividly remember the last time these plains filled with water, in a biblical inundation in 1998. But that was before the fracking boom that hit the region because of the oil-rich geological formation that lies beneath it, known as the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nToday, a repeat of the historic flood could wreak havoc, an Inside Climate News investigation has found.\n\n\"There's a whole lot of tanks full of oil that are going to float away,\" said Sara Dubose, a fifth-generation landowner in Gonzales County with 10 tanks in the floodplain on her family's ranchlands, each holding up to 21,000 gallons of oil or toxic wastewater. \"Spill all over our land and ruin it for 100 years.\"\n\nAlmost 20 feet of water could submerge some of the tanks on the Dubose family's land in a flooding event similar to 1998, according to an analysis of data from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.\n\nInside Climate News scoured satellite imagery of the area to identify batteries of oil tanks and other oil field infrastructure in the Eagle Ford Shale near waterways in the Guadalupe River Basin. Using latitude and longitude coordinates of each tank battery, the analysis used FEMA flood mapping data to extract the agency's estimates for the depths of its benchmark flood scenarios at each location.\n\nIn some areas, the 1998 flood exceeded the worst-case scenario considered by disaster planners. FEMA calls it the \"500-year flood,\" a hypothetical event the agency estimates has a 0.2% chance of happening in any year.\n\nToday, a 500-year flood across the entire area analyzed would cover at least 22 tank batteries containing 144 individual oil and wastewater tanks with 10 or more feet of water. Of those, 12 tanks would sit beneath at least 20 feet of water.\n\nFEMA's estimates for a 500-year flood understate present risk in many locations, research shows, as warming air and oceans continue to fuel an intensification of extreme rainfall.\n\nDubose experienced the 1998 flood, when the Guadalupe River sprang from its banks and filled the shallow valleys at the edge of these coastal plains. The water almost reached her house, 7 miles from the river, where it trapped her for a week, covering U.S. 183 in both directions as it drained slowly into San Antonio Bay on the coast.\n\nIn a warming world with more intense rainfall, a future flood could be even more severe.\n\n\"One day, it's going to happen,\" Dubose said. \"We've all been concerned about the oil field flooding.\"\n\nWhen flooding hit a smaller oil field in 2013 in northeastern Colorado, authorities tallied two dozen overturned tanks and almost 90,000 gallons of oil and wastewater spilled. During Hurricane Katrina in 2005, millions of gallons of oil spilled when several supersized storage tanks floated off their pads. In 1994, flooding on the San Jacinto River in East Texas severed eight pipelines, ignited massive fires, injured hundreds of people and released more than 2 million gallons of petroleum products.\n\nLast summer, severe flooding in the Texas Hill Country near Kerrville washed away a girls' summer camp and killed more than 100 people along the Guadalupe River, 150 miles upstream from the Eagle Ford Shale.\n\nThe rules for building in floodplains in Texas fall to county governments, often small and rural. The 78 tank batteries in the Guadalupe floodplains analyzed all sit within Gonzales and DeWitt counties, which have a combined population of about 40,000 people.\n\nIt was left to the governments of the two counties to design and implement floodplain policies during the shale oil boom.\n\n\"Those are not issues that most counties, on an individual basis, are well suited to handle,\" said Todd Votteler, former executive manager of science, intergovernmental relations and policy at the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority. \"It raises a question of how serious the state is about avoiding future flood damage in high-risk areas if we don't have a statewide policy.\"\n\nTank batteries at well sites aren't typically secured to the ground by anything but the weight of the equipment and the oil and wastewater inside them. While they are especially vulnerable, they aren't the only industry infrastructure that could be affected by flooding. Eight oil pipelines and about two dozen gas pipelines also cross the Guadalupe River in the Eagle Ford Shale, and others cross local creeks.\n\nThe batteries in the floodplain on Dubose's property were previously operated by Canadian firm Baytex Energy, which sold all of its Eagle Ford Shale assets in November for $3.2 billion to an undisclosed buyer. Other operators with numerous batteries in the floodplains include EOG Resources, Devon Energy and Burlington Resources, a subsidiary of ConocoPhillips. None of those companies responded to requests for comment.\n\nThe floodplains also contain many open and buried pits of drilling waste. Dubose unsuccessfully sued an oil company in 2018, alleging that the unlined pit where it buried drilling mud and wastewater on her property was responsible for the orange, gassy goo that seeped up from the earth during heavy rainfall.\n\n\"Think about all the stuff that's soaked into the ground,\" said David Muir, a fifth-generation landowner with more than a dozen wells on his property. \"They've got thousands of chemicals that go into the drilling mud.\"\n\nMuir's land has been in his family since the 1840s. Outside his old, single-story ranch house near the border of Gonzales and DeWitt counties, a private airplane hangar and a waterpark-style swimming pool commemorate the riches fracking has brought to the region.\n\nInside the house between clamoring dogs, Muir sifted through boxes of photos that predated the shale boom. He pulled out strips of 11 film photos taped together to show the vast landscape of water that overtook this rolling savannah on the morning of Oct. 17, 1998.\n\nIt rose far past the tops of the trees. It even covered a spot on Muir's land where a tank battery now stands, 1.5 miles from the Guadalupe River.\n\n\"I thought the whole world was going to flood,\" he said as he flipped through the old pictures. \"We haven't had a flood like that since the oil field hit us.\"\n\nIt all seemed to happen in minutes, recalled Ben Prause, a former elected executive of DeWitt County who presided during the flood. The water wasn't even raging but almost calm as it swiftly rose up to swallow about two-thirds of the town of Cuero. In one case, he said, sheriff's deputies entered a home with water to their knees to save an old woman. When they walked out minutes later, the water was at their chests.\n\n\"It was so rapid,\" said Prause, 92, at his home in downtown Cuero, a few blocks from the 1998 waterline. \"It was just terrible. Water was everywhere.\"\n\nIt wasn't just the Guadalupe River, he said. Several major tributaries also flooded to make the situation worse. Torrential rains hit the upper reaches of Plum Creek and Sandies Creek, which both gushed simultaneously into the Guadalupe.\n\n\"What made it so bad is they all hit about the same time,\" he said.\n\nThese creeks barely trickle for most of the year, said Prause, a 1950 graduate of Cuero High School, but on rare occasions their large floodplains fill.\n\nIn 1998 the floodwaters south of Gonzales were several miles wide, said a report issued the next year by the Guadalupe-Blanco River Authority and FEMA, exceeding predicted worst-case scenarios in some areas.\n\n\"It was the flood that many thought would never happen,\" the report said. \"Unfortunately, an even greater flood will occur sometime in the future.\"\n\nThe 1998 flood caused a few oil spills, said James Dodson, 71, co-founder of the San Antonio Bay Partnership and the son of a South Texas pipeline technician. His late wife worked for Texas' environmental regulator and spent weeks overseeing cleanups. But the extent of oil field infrastructure at that time was nothing compared with today.\n\n\"That was long before the Eagle Ford Shale plays came along,\" he said. \"The landscape was so much different in that regard - there's so many more facilities and well pads now.\"\n\nToday, along one eastward turn in the Guadalupe's snaking course, three batteries consisting of 15 tanks would sit under about 20 feet of water in a 500-year flood. One of them, operated by EOG Resources, is just 500 feet from the riverbank.\n\nTwo miles from the Guadalupe River, four tanks operated by Burlington Resources would take on almost 23 feet of water.\n\nNear Boggy Creek, east of the Guadalupe River by the small town of Dreyer, 10 feet of water would cover EOG Resources' Shiner Hub gas processing plant, a complex of 14 tanks, pipes, motors, chemical separators and flares.\n\nAlong Peach Creek, southeast of Gonzales, batteries of 12 and 28 tanks previously operated by Baytex Energy would sit under 13 feet and 8 feet of water, respectively.\n\nThe oil from toppled tanks probably wouldn't spill onto the land around them, said Dodson, a former water department director for the city of Corpus Christi who worked South Texas oil fields in the 1970s. Instead, he predicted, it would float on the water and end up at the edge of the flood's crest, like the rings in a bathtub. More of it, he said, would wash over the creeks and estuaries of San Antonio Bay and into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"It's a disaster waiting to happen,\" said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlager, an 89-year-old Catholic nun from Cuero. \"They have these oil wells all through these areas that flooded like it's no problem.\"\n\nThe oil field infrastructure dates back less than 20 years to the shale revolution, when innovations in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing unleashed an explosion of new oil exploration.\n\nBack then, Riebschlager, the daughter of a local civic leader, conducted town hall meetings for local families baffled by the swarm of businessmen and lawyers descending on their sleepy countryside, whipping up 100-page contracts and casually writing checks for mind-boggling sums.\n\nMany landowners warned the oil companies about flooding, she said.\n\nRiebschlager related the story of one rancher: \"When they were getting ready to drill there, he said, ‘Please don't drill them here, it's a floodplain. They will flood.' The oil man says, ‘Don't worry, we'll have all the oil and gas out of this ground before the next flood.' ‘\n\nDubose, who missed out on the riches of the oil boom because her mother sold her family's mineral rights, got a similar answer when she mentioned the 1998 floods to the company drilling on her land. She recalls a man telling her: ‘That was a 100-year flood so it won't happen for another 100 years.'\n\nThat's a common misconception surrounding terms like a 100-year and the 500-year flood, said Matthew Berg, CEO of Houston-based water risk management firm Simfero. A former water specialist with Texas A&M AgriLife, he understands why the general public is misled.\n\n\"They would understand a 100-year flood only happens once every 100 years,\" he said. \"That's a problem because statistics don't work that way.\"\n\nSuch flood events don't literally return only once every century. Rather, computer models estimate that such an event has a 1% chance of occurring at any given spot in a year. What happened in previous years doesn't change those odds.\n\nFurthermore, Berg said, these estimated probabilities are \"to some extent meaningless\" where records go back barely 100 years. They are meant for purposes of development planning, not weather forecasting. The likelihood of storms across centuries isn't known. Neither is when the 500-year floodplain of the Guadalupe River may fill up again. Two things are certain, though: It will fill again and the chances are increasing.\n\nThe warming climate is making precipitation more intense in Texas and beyond. A similar amount of rain falls in fewer, more concentrated storms than it used to, according to a 2024 report from the Office of the Texas State Climatologist at Texas A&M University.\n\n\"Many studies have documented an increase in extreme rainfall in Texas and surrounding areas,\" the report said. \"Extreme rainfall is strongly affected by increased temperatures.\"\n\nIn Texas, as elsewhere on the planet, all 10 of the warmest years on record have occurred since 2011. Warming is a result of the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, released in large part by burning fossil fuels like the oil in the tanks sitting in the floodplains across the Eagle Ford Shale. And warmer air can hold more water vapor, leading to heavier downpours.\n\nIf global fossil fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb, so will extreme rainfall.\n\n\"Extreme precipitation is expected to increase in intensity on average statewide,\" the state climatologist's report said. \"We anticipate an additional increase of about 10% in expected extreme rainfall intensity in 2036 compared to 2001-2020 and an overall increase of over 20% compared to 1950-1999.\"\n\nThose changes in rainfall intensity correspond to a 50% increase in the likelihood of extreme precipitation compared to 2001-2020, the report said, and a 100% increase compared to 1950-1999.\n\nHowever, heavy rains alone don't always make a mega-flood. They have to fall on just the right areas, across multiple tributaries of a single river so that their waters all converge at once downstream.\n\nIf a 500-year flood returns to the Eagle Ford Shale, it's hard to tell how much oil, wastewater and other petroleum fluids could spill. Conventional oil field tanks range from 210 to 750 barrels in size, or from 13,000 to 32,000 gallons. Typical tank batteries in the Eagle Ford often include five 500-barrel oil tanks and one 500-barrel wastewater tank, according to an investor presentation by Baytex Energy. Some are out of use or empty, some are full, most are in between.\n\nWhatever fluids wash down the river would flow into San Antonio Bay, part of the winter grounds for the world's last flock of wild, endangered whooping cranes, then into the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n\"With a flood, it causes a lot more dispersion. It breaks it up then you've got oil mixed with sediment and debris. It can stink and it's much, much harder to clean up,\" said Diane Wilson, founder of San Antonio Bay Estuarine Waterkeeper and a 77-year-old former shrimper who lives near the mouth of the Guadalupe River. \"It would be unbelievable, the damage it could do.\"\n\nLast summer, Dubose said, she thought it was about to happen. As soon as she saw the news late at night on the Fourth of July, she rushed out and sped her white Hummer down ranch roads to the river.\n\nIncredible rainfall was hitting the Guadalupe about 150 miles upstream in the Hill Country. Online posts said the water had washed away a summer camp for girls.\n\nDubose had flashbacks to 1998, when there were also overnight rainstorms far upriver that put this region underwater for a week. So she hurried to save a mobile home parked at her fishing camp by the river, the same spot where she'd lost a mobile home in 1998.\n\nAlmost there, she passed nervously between the towering, three-story tank batteries in the floodplain on her land, then past the site of the buried waste where, she said, the grass dies each time heavy rains bring the water table to the surface.\n\nLuckily for Dubose, no torrent came downriver. For Kerrville, in the Hill Country, it was the worst flood since 1987. But all the heavy rain fell upstream of a major dam and reservoir, where water levels were low enough to absorb it. So the Eagle Ford Shale was spared, for now.\n\n\"What happened in Kerrville, if that happens here, that's a really bad situation,\" Dubose said. \"We've told the oil field, this is going to flood someday.\"\n\nThis report is published in partnership with Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, independent news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.\n\nThis article originally published at ‘Disaster waiting to happen': Fracking boom put hundreds of tanks in Guadalupe River floodplain.",

    "fullText": "Feb 8 (Reuters) - A prominent Venezuelan opposition politician was kidnapped in Caracas on Sunday night just hours after his release from jail, according to his son and Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina ​Machado, casting uncertainty over government vows to free political prisoners.\n\nJuan Pablo Guanipa, a close ally of opposition ‌leader Machado, was freed earlier on Sunday after more than eight months in jail on accusations of leading a terrorist plot, after months in ‌hiding.\n\nHis release followed promises by Venezuela's government to pass an amnesty law and release more prisoners, as U.S. pressure mounts a month after the Trump administration captured and deposed long-time leader Nicolas Maduro.\n\nGuanipa's son Ramon Guanipa said in a video on social media his father was ambushed by 10 heavily armed, unidentified men who he called \"officials.\"\n\n\"My father has again been kidnapped,\" he ⁠said. \"I demand proof of life immediately.\"\n\nVenezuela's government ‌did not immediately reply to a request for comment about Guanipa's disappearance following his release.\n\nMachado, who won the Nobel for her efforts to unseat Maduro, also urged Guanipa's release.\n\n\"Heavily armed men ‍dressed in civilian clothes arrived in four vehicles and took him away by force,\" she said in a post on X, noting the incident took place in the Los Chorros area of the capital Caracas.\n\nJust hours before, the elder Guanipa had posted videos to ​social media in which he spoke to journalists and a crowd of cheering supporters. He urged the release ‌of other political prisoners and called the current administration illegitimate.\n\nMaduro's reelection in 2024 was widely seen as rigged and a number of countries, including the U.S., do not recognize his government's legitimacy.\n\nGuanipa said in an interview with a local online outlet that he spoke briefly with Machado after being let go, and hoped to speak with her further the next day.\n\nVenezuela's opposition and human rights groups have said for years that the country's socialist government uses detentions to stamp ⁠out dissent.\n\nThe government denies holding political prisoners and says those jailed ​have committed crimes. Officials say nearly 900 of these people have been ​released, but they have not been clear about the timeline and appear to be including releases from previous years. The government has not provided an official list of how many prisoners will ‍be released or revealed their ⁠identities.\n\nRights group Foro Penal has said 383 political prisoners had been let go since the Venezuelan government announced on January 8 that it would begin a new series of releases. It counted another 35 releases on ⁠Sunday, including opposition politician Freddy Superlano and lawyer Perkins Rocha, also close allies of Machado.\n\nThe group's director Alfredo Romero said on social media they ‌did not yet have clear information about who took Guanipa.",

    "fullText": "Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA) sent a searing letter in which he stated his intention to ask Ghislaine Maxwell if she or Jeffrey Epstein ever procured “underage girls” for President Donald Trump.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-TN) announced last month that Maxwell would be deposed by the committee, and that deposition is scheduled for this Monday.\n\nBut on Sunday, Maxwell’s attorney made clear she intends to plead the Fifth Amendment.\n\nCongressman Khanna, the ranking member on the committee, responded with a searing letter to Comer listing the questions he planned to ask Maxwell — including a few loaded ones about Trump:\n\n4. It is well documented that you, President Donald Trump, and Mr. Epstein had a social relationship, and there are several photographs of you together. Did you or Mr. Epstein ever arrange, facilitate, or provide access to underage girls to President Trump?\n\n5. After President Trump publicly stated that he would “look at” a possible pardon for you, did you or anyone acting on your behalf have any discussions with him or his representatives about a pardon or reduced sentence in exchange for your silence?\n\nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform\n\nU.S. House of Representatives Washington, DC\n\nIt is my understanding that Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell intends to invoke her Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination and decline to answer all substantive questions at her upcoming deposition before the House Oversight Committee.\n\nThis position appears inconsistent with Ms. Maxwell’s prior conduct, as she did not invoke the Fifth Amendment when she previously met with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche to discuss substantially similar subject matter.\n\nI understand that Ms. Maxwell intends to assert this privilege on a “blanket basis” by reading a prepared statement at the outset of the deposition and refusing to permit Members to question her individually through counsel, rather than invoking the privilege on a question-by-question basis.\n\nAccordingly, for the sake of clarity, I am submitting in this letter the questions I intend to ask at Ms. Maxwell’s deposition and request confirmation from the Chair as to whether she intends to invoke the Fifth Amendment in response to the following questions:\n\n1. On December 17, 2025, you filed a habeas corpus petition stating that “four named co-conspirators” and 25 men who entered into secret settlements were not indicted as part of the investigation. Is that statement accurate?\n\n2. Who are the four co-conspirators and the 25 men, other than Jeffrey Epstein, who sexually abused minors at Epstein’s island, his New Mexico ranch, or his New York residence, and why do you believe they were not indicted?\n\n3. What information, evidence, or personal knowledge do you have regarding why these individuals were not charged or prosecuted by federal authorities?\n\n4. It is well documented that you, President Donald Trump, and Mr. Epstein had a social relationship, and there are several photographs of you together. Did you or Mr. Epstein ever arrange, facilitate, or provide access to underage girls to President Trump?\n\n5. After President Trump publicly stated that he would “look at” a possible pardon for you, did you or anyone acting on your behalf have any discussions with him or his representatives about a pardon or reduced sentence in exchange for your silence?\n\n6. What client lists or records did you or Mr. Epstein maintain that document the identities of clients or associates?\n\n7. Please identify any foreign governments or intelligence services, including those associated with Russia and Israel, that Mr. Epstein shared information with or otherwise acted on behalf of, and describe the nature and purpose of any such relationships.\n\nTo avoid any doubt about the scope of Ms. Maxwell’s Fifth Amendment claim, please confirm that Ms. Maxwell intends to invoke the Fifth Amendment on these questions. Furthermore, I request this document be moved into the official record at the start of Ms. Maxwell’s deposition.\n\nThank you for your prompt attention to this matter.\n\nThe post BREAKING: Searing Dem Letter Asks Ghislaine Maxwell If She or Epstein Procured ‘Underage Girls to President Trump’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "fullText": "The White House’s Board of Peace aims to advance Gaza ceasefire, but Hamas control, armed militias, and Rafah crossing delays pose major challenges.\n\nThe White House is planning to host a meeting of its Board of Peace on February 19, Axios reported over the weekend. This is important because it continues to try to push forward the ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nHowever, as recent Israeli airstrikes have shown, there are many challenges in Gaza. Hamas is still armed, and it is accused of continuing to plot attacks or cause chaos in Gaza.\n\nThe Board of Peace is supposed to support reconstruction, as well as an international security force and the disarmament ofHamas. In addition, it has an executive board and also a High Representative for Gaza. With so many moving parts, a meeting in mid-February is important.\n\nUS President ratified the Board of Peace on January 22. The second phase of the Gaza plan began in January. US Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have been pushing for investment in Gaza and reconstruction and other elements of the ceasefire to move forward. Both men were on the US aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln over the weekend as US-Iran tensions continue.\n\nWhen the Board of Peace was ratified, the Chief Commissioner of the National Committee for the Administration of Gaza, Dr. Ali Sha’ath, said, “I want to start by thanking President Donald J. Trump and his Administration for his intensive efforts to advance peace in the whole region… These efforts created the opportunity for a new future in Gaza, but what will really matter is what comes next.”\n\nShaath is supposed to be running the technical committee that is supposed to help Gaza move toward peace in this phase. However, it doesn't appear his committee has been allowed to do any real work in Gaza. Israel appears to oppose the committee and oppose any links to the Palestinian Authority.\n\nIn essence, this means that Hamas remains in control of Gaza. Officials in Jerusalem have said the Palestinian Authority will have no role in governance in Gaza. They have not said Hamas will have no role in governance, which appears to mean Hamas will remain.\n\nOn the other hand, another phenomenon in Gaza is also concerning. Reports that various militias in Gaza are harassing Gazans who seek to come and go from Rafah raise questions about the policy of having armed militias in Gaza.\n\nAccording to Israel’s Ynet, “four days after Rafah crossing reopened, Gaza residents still disappointed. Only about 20 patients have been allowed to leave Gaza out of some 22,000 requests, while just 75 people have returned after lengthy inspections, limited to one suitcase, a phone, and 600 dollars, amid reports of harassment by Abu Shabab militiamen.”\n\nThe report goes on to say that the frustration Gazans feel from long waits at the border is compounded by having to deal with what appears to be lawlessness in the areas between the border and the half of Gaza still controlled by Hamas.\n\n“Adding to the frustration are reports of involvement by members of the Abu Shabab militia from Rafah, which is backed by Israel, in interrogating and detaining those returning to Gaza. Palestinian media, particularly Hamas outlets, highlighted the account of Rutanah al-Rakab, who returned from Egypt this week.”\n\nThe report notes that one woman said, “after the inspections on the Palestinian side ended, militiamen arrived, declared that they were our brothers and that they were fighting Hamas…They grabbed me and tried to hand me over to Israeli forces, but foreign officials operating at the crossing, apparently European monitors, prevented it.”\n\nSome people said they are being interrogated by the militias, and even handcuffed and blindfolded. They also complain of theft by the militia. The question now remains why Gazans are being given this stark choice of living under Hamas rule, which they have known since 2007, and the chaos of militias.\n\nIf the people in Gaza feel the militias are a worse choice than Hamas, then they will gravitate back towards Hamas rule. In addition, it’s not clear what laws the militias operate under to extrajudicially detain people. The reports at Ynet about the militias and the fact that they are armed raise many questions about what is happening in Gaza.\n\nMost successful societies are not run by militias. For instance, the fate of armed groups in Yemen and Syria illustrates how fragile these types of groups can be. The same is true in Iraq, where the US backed what was called the “awakening” of various Sunni tribes in Anbar between 2006 and 2008.\n\nWhile initially successful, the tribal groups did not bring security in the long term. In other contexts, successful states have done away with militias in favor of formal professional armies.\n\nGeorge Washington and the Continental Congress, for instance, sought to professionalize the American Revolution after initial gains by militias near Boston in 1775. Israel immediately got rid of the various armed groups that had been at the forefront of the Jewish underground after the War of Independence.\n\nThe Haganah basically became the modern IDF, and the Irgun and Stern groups were abolished as armed forces. This saved Israel from the kind of chaos and infighting that divided the Arab irregular fighters of 1947-1948.\n\nAnother challenge for Gaza is the fact that the opening of the Rafah crossing, a key part of the second phase of the ceasefire, has had many hurdles. CNN reports that “the first week of the partial reopening of the Rafah crossing between Gaza and Egypt was marked by confusion and logistical hurdles, according to Palestinians attempting to cross and multiple sources who spoke to CNN on condition of anonymity.”\n\nThe report goes on to say that “the disorder resulted in far fewer Palestinians traversing the border between Egypt and Gaza than was expected, nearly two years after Israel seized and shut the crossing.\n\nWhen the partial reopening was announced last week, an Israeli security official told CNN that 150 Palestinians per day would be allowed to leave Gaza, while only 50 would be permitted to enter. But even that detail was unclear, as Egyptian state media reported that only 50 would be allowed to leave and the same number to enter.”\n\nUS President Donald Trump ratified the Board of Peace on January 22. At the time, the new High Representative for Gaza, Nickolay Mladenov, said, “Who would’ve thought two years ago that we would be sitting here with this group of countries, with this leadership, giving the people of Gaza a new chance?… For too long, Gazans, Palestinians, and Israelis have lived with conflict, with death, with destruction. Now, the page turns.”\n\nIn addition, US Special Envoy for Peace Missions Steve Witkoff added, “We have achieved a peace deal in Gaza. We have brought the hostages home… And maybe most importantly, we have created a sense of hope for what the future can bring in Gaza and all other places where the Board of Peace will operate. And I am so honored, Mr. President, to have worked on this on your behalf.”\n\nThe February meeting will be an important symbol, a month after the ratification, to get things moving forward. The hurdles of Rafah may have been worked out by then. The question remains now about the role of the militias and whether people in Gaza will have access to any health care or education that is not run by Hamas.\n\nIf the alternative to Hamas is only men with guns in armed militias, it’s unlikely people in Gaza will choose that as a preferred way of life. This will essentially just create another cycle of the status quo of Hamas in power.\n\nOver the years, some voices have argued that it is a good strategy for Jerusalem to divide Gaza from the West Bank by having Hamas in Gaza. After October 7, it’s unclear if that strategy will continue. So far, the status quo is that Hamas has regained its rule in half of Gaza.",

    "description": "Aoi Onodera, 32, decided to renovate the Japanese home that had been in his family since the 1940s rather than let it fall into disuse.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Aoi Onodera, 34, which took place at Aoito, the café he manages in Zushi, Japan. His words have been translated and edited for length and clarity.\n\nI grew up visiting this house. It originally belonged to my grandfather's older sister, and whenever I traveled down from Iwate, the northern prefecture in Japan where I grew up, this was where the family gathered.\n\nLater, I worked as a rehabilitation consultant at hospitals in Osaka and Yokohama. I moved, but this place was always in the back of my mind.\n\nWhen my great aunt passed away about 14 years ago, the house became something of an akiya — technically empty, though relatives still came by now and then.\n\nSix years ago, I started wondering what we should do with the house. It was in rough shape at the time. The house was built in 1940, and it felt wasteful to let it fade.\n\nThat's when the idea of renovating it — and eventually turning it into a café — began to take shape.\n\nWhat you see is pretty consistent with how it looked before. The original 85-year-old tatami is still intact, and the main beam and post structure remain.\n\nThe shoji paper screen doors are intentionally torn, encouraging kids to poke their fingers through them — some adults can't resist, too. The mud walls used to be darker; painting them white brightened the atmosphere a bit, but overall, we kept things close to the original bones. We added what we had to — like the counter — and let the rest speak for itself.\n\nI wanted the café to feel like a third place, somewhere locals and family could gather casually.\n\nI've been running the café for almost four years now. On weekdays, it's mostly locals, and on weekends and holidays, around 30% of customers are tourists.\n\nThe furniture and many of the paintings have been here since I was a kid, but the lighting was my choice. I traveled to shops in cities across Japan — including Kobe, Chiba, and elsewhere — picking pieces, such as a 1960s American lamp, that matched the mood I wanted.\n\nI spent about six months cleaning, repairing, and preparing the house.\n\nUntil I got started at the café, I'd worked only in hospitals — I had no food-and-drink experience at all — so inventing dishes, prepping ingredients, and managing a kitchen were all new to me. Every part was hard at first.\n\nThe menu now features seasonal vegetables from the region. We also serve desserts like tiramisu and cheesecake.\n\nMy younger sister and I run the café together. I take weekends, she handles weekday afternoons. We have a close relationship, so I don't micromanage. I trust her to run things as she sees fit. I leave it to her good judgment.\n\nl didn't open the café to ride the trend of renovating old Japanese homes around the end of COVID, when more foreigners started visiting and buying property. That was never my motivation.\n\nI just didn't want a place, which had been in the family so long, to fall into disuse. One of my relatives still owns it, and I pay rent monthly. My family tells me they're glad the house looks better now, and locals appreciate having a community spot.\n\nWe also host musical performances here. Since the house was built in the 40s, we like to play music from that era — oldies, jazz, that sort of thing. It fits.\n\nI'm 34 now, and when I look at young Japanese today, I notice how differently they think about work and life. They are more balanced, more creative, more intentional than I was in my 20s.\n\nFor me, juggling the café, freelance rehabilitation work, and managing concerts has become the right pace. Back at the hospital, I sometimes get in trouble for doing things my own way and working too freely, so maybe this kind of multi-directional work suits me better. It allows me to express myself.\n\nIn a hospital, my world was doctors, nurses, and patients. Opening the café introduced me to a much wider community: grandparents, kids, tourists, and people whose values and backgrounds I never would've encountered otherwise.\n\nOf course, as with people in any environment, some customers are wonderful; some are thoughtless and create problems for others. But even that teaches me something, that the world is full of people I wouldn't have met if I'd stayed in the hospital forever.\n\nThis aging house, somehow, continues to beckon new life.\n\nDo you have a story to share about renovating your family's house in Japan?

    "description": "A Google executive explains why he taught his kids to understand AI — and how they ended up vibe coding and participating in a hackathon.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Asif Saleem, a financial services go-to-market lead for Japan and the Asia Pacific region at Google. Asif is the father of 13-year-old Usman Asif and 18-year-old Shanzey Asif. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nIt's important for parents to help kids understand we're going through a very transformative time. This is like the era when the internet or mobile first emerged. With AI, it may be even bigger.\n\nKids need to understand this and embrace the technology. Whatever they end up studying — computer science, English, or philosophy — they can make AI part of it.\n\nI was curious about Cursor and some of the other vibecoding tools, so I joined a few \"Code with AI\" weekend sessions for executives.\n\nI really enjoyed it. Within a matter of hours, we were able to develop different applications. I developed a statement analyzer for a financial services system.\n\nOnce I came back home, I spoke to my family about it and showed them the demo. My children, Usman and Shanzey, are both tech-savvy, so that drove their interest. They attended the same course a few weeks later.\n\nThey were the youngest in the class. The good part was that they were completely independent, so I let them be on their own. That's how they ventured into vibe coding and participated in Cursor's 24-hour weekend hackathon in Singapore.\n\nThey've become more curious about things. Through vibe coding, they've learned to be more creative and to use technology to understand how things work.\n\nNeither of them has a formal technology background — they're not software developers — but they've been able to think through ideas, be more creative, and use technology to solve problems.\n\nTechnology is the biggest enabler. The question is how humans use it — whether for good or bad. If it's for good, what are the guardrails?\n\nUsing it for good means creating value, solving real challenges, and making information more accessible.\n\nManaging screentime is the reason we developed a reward system for Usman because he's young and he loves gaming. Gaming comes as a reward for achieving goals. Those goals include making your own breakfast, making your bed, or helping clean the house.\n\nWhen Shanzey is studying, she can't use AI for the content she's creating — it can't even be AI-inspired. It has to be her original work.\n\nThat's super important because schools validate whether output is AI-generated. The same applies to Usman.\n\nIt's important to have both physical and digital skills. Usman plays football because physical activity is important at his age. Shanzey is focused on school right now — her exams are very important, and getting good grades matters.\n\nI'd say my role is more like a coach — brainstorming with them. My wife does the same, helping them think through ideas and keeping them honest.\n\nI'm often busy with work, so a lot of this couldn't be done without my wife's help.\n\nThere's nothing better than hands-on learning. That's something I've learned over the last few years.\n\nYou will face challenges and go through them. Parents should get their kids to do things, give them challenges, and nurture them as they work through those challenges. With hands-on experience, they can get better results faster.\n\nWith building an app, we co-create the idea, but then the important part is making it happen and reporting back on progress.\n\nAt Google, I work with enterprise customers trying to transform their businesses with AI. I can see what's happening on the ground and how things are changing.\n\nI also see a lot of young talent at Google. They come in thinking about creating apps and learning skills, and I mentor some of them as well.\n\nIt's important to communicate this to my family. I spent time helping them understand how the world is changing and why it's important for them to understand AI.\n\nIt's not about running away from technology. AI will keep advancing, and the only thing you can do is be accustomed to it, no matter what you want to become.\n\nWe're now in a situation where we have very intelligent large language models, and we're also moving toward agentic AI, where you can work with agents that help you do a lot more. Speed and agility are improving, and you can now work within larger ecosystems that combine humans and machines, achieving much more.\n\nIf you know how to coexist and let machines do meaningful work with you, that's a skill to aspire to.\n\nDo you have a story to share about vibe coding?

    "fullText": "Artificial intelligence has entered the realm of online dating. But Coffee Meets Bagel's CEO says there's a mark it can't meet.\n\nShn Juay, the co-CEO of the dating app that has around 20 million users worldwide, said her team was exploring how to integrate AI into its app.\n\nBut she said using AI chatbots to flirt with potential matches was taking it one step too far.\n\n\"I'm on the fence about using a chatbot to represent yourself in the online app to flirt better,\" Juay, who is based in Singapore, said.\n\n\"You have to eventually meet your partner offline, and when you meet, there could be an expectation mismatch,\" she said. \"Your partner might think that you were so engaging on the app, but not in person.\"\n\nCoffee Meets Bagel markets its app as \"for serious daters,\" showing users about 20 potential matches daily.\n\nFor Coffee Meets Bagel, AI still has a place in the online dating sphere. Juay said that the company is planning to use AI to detect scammers and catfishers in its app.\n\n\"It is hurting the dating app industry because we see an increase in users who are using AI-generated photos to misrepresent themselves,\" she said.\n\nAnother useful implementation, she said, was using it to help daters ask each other better questions.\n\n\"Chats fizzle out because — in Asia especially — we are more shy and not great at asking each other questions after 'Hi, how are you,' 'What job are you in,' and 'What are your hobbies?'\"\n\nSeveral app makers are exploring ways to add AI to the dating mix.\n\nMatch Group CEO Spencer Rascoff said in a tech event in October that AI is \"changing everything\" about its dating apps. Match Group owns Tinder, Hinge, and OkCupid, among others.\n\nIn April, Tinder released \"The Game Game,\" an interactive AI chatbot that allows users to practice flirting for five minutes in \"over-the-top, meet-cute scenarios.\" A Business Insider reporter tried the chatbot and found it largely unhelpful.\n\nGrindr's CEO, George Arison, said on a November earnings call that AI would make its app a \"magical experience.\"\n\nOther apps, like Amata, Facebook Dating, Sitch, and Three Day Rule, work like AI-powered matchmakers, narrowing down the dating pool to appeal to daters experiencing swipe fatigue. A pair of Business Insider reporters who tested the apps found them slightly expensive but appreciated that they did the heavy lifting of planning dates.\n\nAnd some daters are taking matters into their own hands, using AI as a wingman by getting tools like ChatGPT to craft Hinge bios and come up with pickup lines.\n\nCoffee Meets Bagel conducted a survey in November with 1,050 of its users in the US, aged 21 to 35. About 80% said they were comfortable with AI assisting them with dating, such as helping decide who to respond to first based on compatibility and responding to common questions.",

(\"Auntie asked me if I have a lot of girlfriends, a lot of girlfriends / Today I have one, tomorrow I'll have another, but there's no wedding.\")\n\n\"Yo Perreo Sola,\" which loosely translates to \"I Twerk Alone,\" was released as a single from \"YHLQMDLG.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he wrote the song from a woman's perspective (hence the feminine adjective, \"sola,\" in the title) to address sexual harassment in clubs.\n\n\"I wanted a woman's voice to sing it — 'yo perreo sola' — because it doesn't mean the same thing when a man sings it,\" he told Rolling Stone. \"But I do feel like that woman sometimes.\"\n\nThe music video ends with a title card that reads, \"Si no quiere bailar contigo, respeta, ella perrea sola.\" (\"If she doesn't want to dance with you, respect her, she twerks alone.\")\n\n\"Safaera,\" a collaboration with Ñengo Flow and Puerto Rican duo Jowell & Randy, is the 14th track on \"YHLQMDLG.\"\n\n\"Party\" is the 11th track on \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" The studio version features Rauw Alejandro.\n\n\"Voy a Llevarte Pa PR,\" meaning \"I'm Going to Take You to Puerto Rico,\" is the second track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\"\n\n\"Eoo,\" which samples \"Perreo Baby\" by Héctor & Tito, is the 15th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" It won the 2026 Grammy Award for best global music performance.\n\n\"Monaco\" is the second track on Bad Bunny's fifth solo studio album, \"Nadie Sabe Lo Que Va a Pasar Mañana.\"\n\nLady Gaga made an appearance during Bad Bunny's performance to sing a salsa-style version of her hit duet with Bruno Mars (sans Mars).\n\n\"Baile Inolvidable\" is the third track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" The studio version features live salsa arrangements, recorded by students from San Juan's Escuela Libre de Música, according to a press release for the album.\n\n\"Nuevayol\" is the opening track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\"\n\nThe song features a sample of \"Un Verano en Nueva York,\" or \"A Summer in New York,\" originally performed by Andy Montañez and El Gran Combo de Puerto Rico.\n\n\"This album is the result of the experiences that have led me to get to know myself better, even getting to know the rhythms I enjoy most—the ones I truly enjoy singing and creating,\" Bad Bunny said in a statement.\n\n\"I am Puerto Rican, I am Caribbean, and my music, my culture, my country's history run through my veins, from plena to reggaeton,\" he continued. \"At the peak of my career and popularity, I want to show the world who I am.\"\n\nBad Bunny enlisted Ricky Martin to sing \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii,\" a song about American colonization.\n\nThe two Latino singers have worked together in the past; Martin contributed backing vocals to Bad Bunny's 2019 single \"Caro\" and made a cameo in the 2020 music video for \"Yo Visto Así.\"\n\n\"El Apagón,\" which translates to \"The Power Outage,\" is the 16th track on \"Un Verano Sin Ti.\" It was later released as the album's seventh single.\n\n\"Café Con Ron\" is the 12th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos.\" The studio version features the Puerto Rican ensemble Los Pleneros de la Cresta.\n\n\"DTMF\" is the 16th track on \"Debí Tirar Más Fotos,\" later released as the album's fourth single.\n\nIt was nominated for both record and song of the year at the 2026 Grammys, but the awards went to \"Luther\" by Kendrick Lamar and SZA and \"Wildflower\" by Billie Eilish, respectively.",

His backup dancers ran out with flags of the countries in North and South America.\n\nHe also performed in front of a billboard with the words: \"THE ONLY THING MORE POWERFUL THAN HATE IS LOVE.\" During his set, he held up a football with the words \"TOGETHER, WE ARE AMERICA\" on it.\n\nThe singer made headlines last week for saying \"ICE Out\" during an acceptance speech at the Grammys, a statement that placed him, a celebrity of Puerto Rican heritage, in direct opposition to the president.",

    "description": "Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's call for a snap election had rattled markets and triggered a sharp selloff in Japanese government bonds.",
    "fullText": "Japan's bond market is back under scrutiny after Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's landslide election victory pushed government bond yields higher, even as stocks surged to record highs.\n\nOn Sunday, Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party secured a decisive win in the general election, giving Takaichi a clear mandate and room to pursue her fiscal agenda.\n\nThat agenda includes increased government spending on defense and social welfare, alongside tax cuts — policies markets have long debated for their impact on Japan's already heavy public debt burden.\n\nFollowing Takaichi's win, Japanese equities surged nearly 6% to record highs on optimism around fiscal support for growth.\n\nBonds, however, moved in the opposite direction. Two-year Japanese government bond yields climbed to their highest level in three decades, while benchmark 10-year yields also rose. Bond prices fall when yields rise.\n\nLonger-dated bonds sent a more mixed signal. Japan's longest-maturity debt — typically the most sensitive to concerns about fiscal sustainability — erased mostly early yield spikes. Yields on 30-year bonds were little changed on the day around midday in Japan, after surging to record highs last month.\n\nJapanese bond yields matter far beyond the country's borders because of Japan's outsize role in global capital flows. Years of ultra-low yields have allowed domestic and foreign investors to borrow cheaply and leverage bets on higher-yielding assets such as US Treasurys and stocks.\n\nThat dynamic has refocused attention on how markets are pricing Japan's fiscal and debt risks under Takaichi's leadership.\n\n\"A bigger mandate is likely to fuel concerns about the potential path of spending plans, warranting renewed weakness in JGBs and the Yen, unless the BoJ were to shift towards faster rate hikes,\" wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Saturday before the polls.\n\nThe Goldman analysts wrote that they expect volatility as markets digest the news.\n\nLast month, Takaichi's call for a snap election rattled global markets and triggered a sharp sell-off in Japanese government bonds, as investors worried her fiscal agenda could further strain public finances.\n\nAnalysts at the time warned the move could serve as a cautionary signal for other heavily indebted governments, as rising bond yields risk pushing up borrowing costs across the economy.\n\nTakaichi has since sought to reassure markets. She said she would pursue a sustainable and responsible fiscal policy and would not rely on deficit-covering sovereign bond issuance to fund a two-year suspension of the food consumption tax.\n\nJapanese government bond yields could still rise further, driven by concerns about increased government spending on areas such as defense and AI, according to Min Joo Kang, a senior economist at ING.\n\nNot all analysts agree that the postelection bond sell-off will last. Vishnu Varathan, Mizuho's head of macro research, excluding Japan, said Takaichi's strong election win gives her the political room to avoid messy policy trade-offs and make clearer, more sustainable decisions about government spending.\n\nHe also pointed to Japan's external balance sheet as a key buffer, arguing that domestic investors can redirect capital back into local markets.\n\n\"Japan's significant holdings of foreign assets (as the world's second largest net creditor) puts it in pole position to re-allocate back home to Japanese assets to the benefit of JPY, JGBs and equities,\" Varathan wrote.",

    "description": "BBC Sport Wales looks at how Wrexham have evolved since being taken over by Ryan Reynolds and Rob Mac five years ago.",
    "fullText": "Five years ago, Wrexham's fortunes changed immeasurably.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Rob Mac completed their takeover of the north Wales side on 9 February, 2021 after receiving overwhelming approval from the Wrexham Supporters Trust three months earlier.\n\nThe Hollywood stars have overseen three successive promotions, although their impact goes way beyond the club's seismic on-field achievements.\n\nAs defender Max Cleworth puts it, \"it's been a mental few years\".\n\nFive years of Hollywood owners - the Wrexham timeline\n\nWrexham's on field success is plain for all to see, however, background developments and groundworks are equally important to sustain Reynold's and Mac's ambitions for the north Wales club.\n\nRegulars at the Stok Cae Ras - or the millions of viewers watching games on screens around the globe - will also have noticed a number of alterations to the world's oldest international football stadium still in continuous use.\n\nThe stadium's iconic Kop Stand was demolished in 2023 having been abandoned for 16 years.\n\nA temporary stand, holding around 3,000 supporters, was used during the 2024-25 campaign before being removed to pave way for a new permanent stand.\n\nWork on the stand - which will hold 7,500 fans in total, taking the overall capacity at Stok Cae Ras to 18,000 - started early on in the 2025-26 season and is due to be completed in early 2027.\n\nAs they do not own their Colliers Park training complex, Wrexham are regularly required to train elsewhere, including at Carden Park or at The Rock - now owned by the club.\n\nBut even other aspects including catering and travel arrangements - which include flying to some away matches to help aid recovery - have been tweaked to improve performance.\n\n\"The difference is massive,\" said former club captain Ben Tozer, who made 136 appearances and won back-to-back promotions with Wrexham.\n\n\"Even though some of the really big changes might not have happened – like we still don't have our own training ground – the infrastructure has improved every year.\n\n\"The players always felt looked after, but the levels have gone up.\"\n\nThe growth is not limited to the men's first team though. Far from it.\n\nAcademy manager Gus Williams and professional development phase lead coach Craig Knight are now in situ as the club aims to produce more home-grown talent.\n\nThe women's side have made enormous strides too.\n\nWrexham were in the tier two Adran North at the time of the takeover but are now challenging for the top-flight Adran Premier title - with a place in Europe on the line.\n\nThey also face reigning league champions Cardiff City in the final of the Adran Trophy on 22 February - further typifying how they have developed into one of the best women's sides in Wales.\n\nIt has all ensured the difference at the club is stark, particularly for new signing Davis Keillor-Dunn, who recently returned six years after leaving Wrexham.\n\n\"I'm just buzzing to see the club in the place it's in now,\" he told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"It shows you how much work has been put in and you're seeing the fruits of it on the pitch.\"\n\nLittle by little, piece by piece, the club keeps evolving. But the headline-grabbing exploits of the first team have ultimately been the key driver.\n\n\"It's the balance of building the club and understanding that the club needed some foundations put in place for the long-term,\" said manager Phil Parkinson.\n\n\"But also that we needed to fast-track the quality at first team level because the squad had been neglected for many years, no-one's fault, through a lack of finances, and [the owners] have been very supportive in both of those categories.\"\n\nLate transfer flurry sets Wrexham up for run-in\n\nGlobal brand in an EFL world - Wrexham's £48m cash injection explained\n\nA mere 110 days after the high-profile change in ownership, manager Dean Keates left the club with Wrexham having missed out on a play-off spot in the fifth-tier National League.\n\nJust 32 days later, Parkinson was tasked with leading the Welsh side's resurgence. Despite a gut-wrenching end to his first season as manager, a 5-4 defeat by Grimsby Town in the play-offs, it has been quite the ride since then.\n\nParkinson has managed 213 regular season league matches and Wrexham's record over that period borders on the ridiculous, in a positive way, of course.\n\nHe has overseen 125 wins, 51 draws and just 37 losses - with his side scoring 407 goals over that time.\n\nIt gives him an astonishing rate of exactly two points per game and an average of little more than 1.9 goals per match when it comes to regular season league fixtures.\n\nIn 2025, history was made as Wrexham returned to the second tier for the first time in 43 years, having become the first ever team to achieve three successive promotions in the English Football League.\n\nIn preparation for the Championship Wrexham smashed their own transfer record three times last summer, with Liberato Cacace, Lewis O'Brien and then Nathan Broadhead becoming their most expensive signing upon moving to north Wales.\n\nAnd having once again strengthened in the mid-season window, Wrexham are not slowing down.\n\nLatest Wrexham news, analysis and fan views\n\nDefender Cleworth is one of only two players, along with Ryan Barnett, to feature in the National League, League Two, League One and the Championship since Reynolds and Mac bought Wrexham.\n\nOn the back of signing a long-term contract extension with the club in January, the academy product said: \"Since I signed my [first] pro deal, I couldn't really have imagined to be sat here five, six years later in the Championship.\"\n\nWrexham were seventh in the National League when Reynolds and Mac were announced as the club's new owners. At present, they are sixth in the Championship - 73 places higher up the football pyramid.\n\nThe social media growth has also been vast. Wrexham had 41,000 followers on Instagram prior to the takeover, that figure has ballooned to 1.5m.\n\nBut perhaps the clearest indicator of the astronomical growth is the value of the club, which now stands at around £350m, an increase of 17,400% compared to the £2m Reynolds and Mac invested upon completing the takeover in 2021.\n\nWith a top six finish firmly within their grasp this season, the rise is showing no sign of stopping, with Cleworth aptly stating: \"It's been a hell of a ride so far, long may that continue.\"",

    "description": "Who impressed and who has the most to do after a transfixing opening weekend of the Six Nations?",
    "fullText": "France were sensational yet inconsistent, England outpowered Wales and it was very, very wet in Rome.\n\nWho impressed, and who has the most to do after a transfixing opening weekend of the Six Nations?\n\nThursday night was an unconventional starting point for the tournament, and for the first 40 minutes hosts France seemed to be playing a different sport altogether in a 36-14 win against Ireland in Paris.\n\nThe electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey scored twice but it was the way France attacked from every position - and their strength in depth - that really impressed the pundits.\n\nFrance were able to score seemingly at will, and all without all-time top try-scorer Damian Penaud - left out despite scoring 40 tries in 59 appearances for his country.\n\n\"The first-half performance from France was amazing - they blew Ireland away,\" Grand Slam winner Donncha O'Callaghan told 5 Live Sport.\n\n\"They are a level ahead of Ireland, maybe two levels. Ireland couldn't compete.\"\n\nTo Ireland's credit they did threaten a comeback in the second half but France then went again to wrap up an emphatic win.\n\nChris Ashton added on Rugby Union Weekly: \"It was magic. France can flip and flop to different styles seamlessly. There is so much you have to contend with playing against them - you don't know which fire to put out first.\n\n\"It's got to be a worry for everyone. France have so much depth - the sport is getting bigger and bigger in the country.\"\n\nCan France be stopped? They face Wales in Cardiff next Sunday.\n\nCatch up with Six Nations Rugby Special on BBC iPlayer and the BBC's Rugby Union Weekly podcast on BBC Sounds\n\nSix Nations fixtures, results, standings and how to follow on the BBC\n\nIf anyone can match France for strength in depth it is England, who started their campaign by thrashing Wales 48-7.\n\nWing Henry Arundell was handed a first start for two years and promptly helped himself to a first-half hat-trick, the first treble by an England men's player since Arundell himself scored five tries against Chile at the 2023 Rugby World Cup.\n\nIncredibly, it was the team's first Six Nations hat-trick since Jonny May against France in 2019.\n\nBen Earl showed some of the fluency France would admire by moving from number eight to centre late on as England showed they are continuing to move in the right direction.\n\n\"England now realise where they can be,\" former scrum-half Matt Dawson told Rugby Union Weekly.\n\n\"Whether that's winning a Grand Slam or a World Cup, only they will know their internal targets.\n\n\"But you can see that winning a scrum is not enough, scoring a try, not enough, winning the game, not enough. They are setting their standards.\"\n\nDawson's former team-mate Paul Grayson was impressed with England's speed out of the blocks at the start of a new cycle.\n\nHe said: \"England were straight in at full tilt - they were ruthless and accurate.\n\n\"England are exciting to watch now. There are lots of moving pieces being done brilliantly well and that's why England are hard to play against now.\"\n\nTougher challenges await - and England head to Murrayfield next weekend.\n\n'The shirt used to weigh heavy - now England players double in size in it'\n\nEngland's riot club focus on fine-tuning after walloping Wales\n\nThat England visit comes at a crucial time for Scotland and their coach Gregor Townsend.\n\nHe came into the tournament courted by Newcastle Red Bulls and with question marks over his commitment to the cause.\n\nA tame display in some horrendous weather in Rome as Italy picked up a famous 18-15 win has left some calling for a change.\n\nFormer Scotland forward John Barclay told Rugby Special: \"I thought before the Six Nations that Scotland had to finish third or above.\n\n\"If they don't, which is now going to be very hard, I think it becomes a necessity to see a change.\n\n\"It's a good group of players and if you are not seeing an improvement there is an option for change. That might be the best thing for Gregor and for Scotland.\"\n\nThe conditions made the going tough, but it was Scotland's heart, not hands, that were questioned.\n\n\"Italy were more aggressive and that's down to desire, not the rain,\" former Scotland and British and Irish Lions prop Peter Wright told BBC Scotland.\n\n\"Townsend is an experienced coach and should have known they couldn't play the rugby they wanted to play in those conditions. Scotland lost the war in the set-pieces.\"\n\nThe defeat was a fifth away loss in a row in the Six Nations for Scotland and their beleaguered coach.\n\nBefore the match, Townsend - who is contracted as head coach until the end of the 2027 World Cup - dismissed a report that he has agreed to take over at Newcastle Red Bulls after the World Cup as \"pure speculation\".\n\nMore displays like this may make that contract end date a moot point. Scotland need to dig deep and find another level of performance against England.\n\nExpect recalls for Duhan van der Merwe and Darcy Graham to provide energy and - Scotland will hope - ammunition.\n\n'Townsend on the ropes after romp in swamp'\n\nI believe in what we're doing - Townsend\n\nIf that defeat left Scotland in crisis, where exactly are Wales?\n\nThrashed at Twickenham, they have now won only two of their past 24 Tests and have not won a Six Nations match since 2023.\n\nDiscipline is a major issue. Wales conceded 16 penalties against England - the most they have conceded in a Test since 2009 - and had four yellow cards, the joint most any team has been shown in a Six Nations match.\n\nBarclay said Wales' issues are mental, not technical.\n\nThey have shipped 248 points and conceded 34 tries in coach Steve Tandy's first five games in charge.\n\n\"It appears there is so much to try and fix in a week for Wales,\" Barclay said.\n\n\"First up has to be their tackling. Defence is easier to sort than attack - it's a mindset.\n\n\"The lack of intent in the tackle is something to look at. How do you fix ill-discipline? If you fix your defence and be a hard team to beat that will sort itself.\"\n\nWales won a Grand Slam as recently as 2019 and a title in 2021, but are heading towards a third consecutive Wooden Spoon. Next up? Free-scoring France on Sunday.\n\nSame old story for sorry Wales in Six Nations\n\nWe let ourselves and people at home down - Lake\n\nThe opening-day win for Italy was a 17th in the Six Nations - and ninth over Scotland.\n\nTheir best campaigns to date have featured two wins, and matching or beating that may be on the agenda.\n\nItaly's only other home game this year is against England on 7 March, but the Azzurri will surely have their eyes on a trip to Wales a week later.\n\n\"It makes you feel very confident in what you can do,\" captain Michele Lamaro said. \"So now we've got a dream in our head. We keep going on.\"\n\nIt's Ireland away on Saturday for Gonzalo Quesada's side.\n\nItaly punish lacklustre Scotland in Rome rain\n\nWho has the best record in the men's Six Nations?\n\nWatch live on BBC TV and ITV, listen to every match on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sports Extra and BBC Sounds, live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny made history with his entirely Spanish set on the sporting world's biggest stage.",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl half-time show was one big love letter to his native Puerto Rico.\n\nThe 14-minute set included guest performances from Lady Gaga and Ricky Martin, along with cameos from the likes of Pedro Pascal, Cardi B, Karol G and Jessica Alba, who could be seen dancing on the porch of his famous casita, a staple of his shows designed to look like a traditional Puerto Rican home.\n\nIt was expected that Bad Bunny, real name Benito Antonio Martinez Ocasio, would use his performance as an opportunity to make a political statement against the current US administration, but instead he used it to promote a message of American unity.\n\nTransporting himself through a Latin landscape, with set pieces that included everything from a nail salon to a bar, the Grammy award winner reeled off a medley of his biggest hits, including Tití Me Preguntó, MONACO and BAILE INoLVIDABLE.\n\nThe 31-year-old, who was the world's most-played artist in 2025 according to streaming service Spotify, made history by becoming the first musician to perform a Super Bowl half-time show entirely in Spanish.\n\nBut he did choose to make two statements in English, one with a billboard message reading \"The only thing more powerful than hate is love\" and the other \"Together, We Are America\" written on a football that he held.\n\nHis performance at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, marked the first time the singer and rapper has performed in the United States since releasing last year's Grammy-award winning album Debí Tirar Más Fotos (I Should Have Taken More Photos).\n\nPuerto Rico, which is a self-governing territory of the USA, was at the heart of everything in this performance, from his early emergence from a sugarcane field to a set that was meant to represent the sounds and sights of the place he calls home.\n\nFamily also featured heavily - from a young couple getting married in a crowd full of Latino dancers to the symbolic moment of Bad Bunny handing his Grammy award to a small child as his 2026 acceptance speech played on a small television.\n\nClimbing an electricity pylon - symbolising the infrastructure that was ruined during the devastating storm - and rapping at the same time, he appeared to pay tribute to the people who died in the 2017 Hurricane Maria.\n\nBad Bunny further spread a message with his outfit - wearing a beige sweater emblazoned with the number 64.\n\nIt could represent the official death toll, which turned out to be significantly lower than the estimated thousands who died.\n\nPresident Trump's administration was criticised at the time by Puerto Ricans who said it failed to provide the same federal support compared to hurricanes that had occurred on the mainland.\n\nThere were no direct criticisms of President Trump, which some saw as a surprise after his two acceptance speeches at last week's Grammy Awards, which he used as an opportunity to speak out against ICE (Immigration and Customs Enforcement) officers.\n\nTheir actions have prompted protests in multiple US cities - most recently in Minneapolis, where federal agents shot and killed two Americans, leading to scrutiny of the administration's tactics.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, who did not attend this year's Super Bowl, said in January that his administration would be \"reviewing everything\" after the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good.\n\nIn his Grammy acceptance speech after his win for best musicá urbana album, Bad Bunny called for \"ICE out\".\n\n\"The hate gets more powerful with more hate. The only thing that's more powerful than hate is love, so, please, we need to be different. If we fight, we have to do it with love.\"\n\nPresident Trump called Bad Bunny's Super Bowl set \"absolutely terrible, one of the worst, EVER!\" on his social media platform Truth Social.\n\nHe added that it was \"an affront to the Greatness of America\".\n\nElements of Bad Bunny's tour set, which has travelled to Central and South America and soon heads to Australia, Japan and Europe, were woven throughout Sunday's performance.\n\nThis included his casita, a house which has gone viral on social media several times for its celebrity guests.\n\nTonight was no different, with Pedro Pascal, Jessica Alba and Cardi B dancing onstage.\n\nOvercoming some early sound issues, the performer leaned heavily on hits from his most recent album, with EoO and DtMF providing some of the high points of the show.\n\nIt was not his first time on the Super Bowl stage - he made a guest appearance with Shakira in 2020 - and he brought confidence as the main star. He swaggered from one corner of the stage to the next all while delivering strong vocals.\n\nLady Gaga was on hand to bring a salsa-inspired rendition of her Bruno Mars collaboration Die With A Smile, and fellow Puerto Rican popstar Ricky Martin sang Lo Que Le Pasó A Hawaii, a song which warns Puerto Ricans to not allow their culture to be erased.\n\nBad Bunny ended his performance by shouting \"God Bless America\" in Spanish and naming multiple North and South American countries, while dancers raised flags in the background, bringing attention to the performer's refusal to bring his world tour in the US, though he did do shows in Puerto Rico.\n\nBad Bunny, who has been producing music since 2013, said in a 2025 interview with i-D that there were \"many reasons\" he would not be performing in the US this time around and \"none of them were out of hate\".\n\nSunday's show represented the best of Latin culture on the sporting world's biggest stage.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPep Guardiola has insisted the Premier League title race is far from over after Manchester City produced a late turnaround to beat Liverpool 2–1 at Anfield.\n\nCity were staring at a damaging defeat after Dominik Szoboszlai put the hosts ahead with a spectacular free-kick in the 74th minute.\n\nBut the champions showed their resilience late on, with Bernardo Silva drawing City level before Erling Haaland sealed the win from the penalty spot.\n\nThe victory keeps City firmly in the title conversation, although Arsenal remain in control at the summit, holding a six-point advantage.\n\nDespite the gap, Guardiola believes there is still plenty of football left to be played, with City competing across multiple competitions.\n\n\"Despite what has happened today, we have many good things to fight for. Final of the Carabao Cup, FA Cup we are there, Champions League last 16, it’s exciting,\" Guardiola told Sky Sports.\n\nMORE:Highlights and stats from Man City's win at Liverpool\n\n\"We are six points behind Arsenal, okay it is a big gap, because they don’t concede goals, they win all their games, but many things are going to happen, I guess.\"\n\nLooking further ahead, Guardiola pointed to the demanding nature of the run-in, particularly for teams balancing domestic and European commitments.\n\n\"I have a feeling that improving a little bit will not be enough to compete against Arsenal but still we have margin (to improve).\"\n\n\"We have to (play them) at home and of course we have to beat them. And I've said, 13 games in the Premier League, from my point of view, from my little experience, is a lot of time, a lot.\"\n\n\"It’s proper. When you go into the last games playing any team in a relegation battle, it’s a proper game, football game.\"\n\n\"That makes an influence in the title race, that’s why being nine, 10, 11 points is more difficult, that’s why all we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal, being there, and try if they sleep, if they make something (a mistake), use it.\"\n\nCity’s win was also notable historically, completing their first league double over Liverpool since 1937.\n\nFixtures in focus Arsenal face a challenging schedule in the coming weeks, including league trips to Brentford, Wolves and Tottenham, alongside home fixtures against Chelsea and Brighton, plus an FA Cup tie with Wigan.\n\nCity return to Premier League action with a home match against Fulham, before an FA Cup fourth-round clash with Salford City, Newcastle, Leeds and Nottingham Forest follow shortly after.",

    "description": "Derrick Barnes didn’t dominate highlight reels in 2025, but when the numbers were tallied and the film was reviewed, his season told a much louder story than the spotlight ever did.",
    "fullText": "Derrick Barnes’ 2025 season did not always come with the loudest headlines, but by year’s end it was impossible to ignore his impact on the Detroit Lions’ defense. Reliable availability, steady production and timely splash plays defined a campaign that earned Barnes a solid B grade and reinforced his value within a young, evolving linebacker group.\n\nBarnes played in every game, a significant accomplishment for a position group that has often battled attrition in recent years. That consistency alone mattered for a Lions defense that leaned heavily on continuity and trust at the second level. Availability became part of Barnes’ value, allowing Detroit to maintain its rotations and avoid scrambling for answers week to week.\n\nStatistically, Barnes delivered one of the more complete seasons of his career. He finished with 40 total tackles, four sacks and one interception. Barnes was not just a downhill run defender; he was deployed as a pressure piece, a spy and an underneath coverage defender, often within the same series.\n\nThe pass-rush production stood out most. Barnes’ four sacks placed him in rare company within the organization’s history. He became the first Lions linebacker to record at least 4.0 sacks and an interception in a single season since Chris Claiborne did it in 2002, a span of more than two decades. For a franchise that has cycled through linebacker combinations for years, that milestone carried weight.\n\nLeaguewide, Barnes’ production compared favorably as well. He and Jack Campbell each finished with 4.0 sacks, tying each other for the most sacks by any off-ball linebacker in the NFL this season. In a league where pressure increasingly comes from the edges, Barnes’ ability to affect quarterbacks from the second level added a valuable wrinkle to Detroit’s defensive front.\n\nBarnes’ interception underscored his growth in coverage. While he will never be mistaken for a true coverage specialist, his awareness improved noticeably. He showed better spacing in zone drops and a clearer understanding of route concepts developing behind him. Those gains did not eliminate all limitations, but they reduced the number of coverage mismatches opposing offenses could exploit.\n\nAgainst the run, Barnes remained a dependable presence. His 40 tackles do not jump off the stat sheet, but they reflect assignment soundness more than volume. Barnes often did the dirty work — setting edges, filling gaps and freeing up teammates to make plays. His physicality and discipline helped stabilize a defense that asked its linebackers to play fast and decisively.\n\nThe B grade reflects both achievement and remaining room for growth. Barnes was productive and dependable, but not dominant. There were stretches where his snap-to-snap impact waned, particularly against elite passing attacks that tested him in space. Continued refinement in coverage and improved play recognition could elevate him from solid contributor to difference-maker.\n\nStill, Barnes’ 2025 season marked meaningful progress. He stayed healthy, produced career-relevant numbers and etched his name into a small slice of franchise history. In a linebacker room led by Campbell and defined by versatility, Barnes proved he belongs. For Detroit, that combination of reliability and upside made his season a clear success.",

    "description": "Lacey Eden scored a goal and had two assists, and freshman goaltender Rhyah Stewart bounced back to pick up an important win for the Badgers.",
    "fullText": "MADISON – The two best teams in women’s college hockey, now depleted by the Olympics, met for the fourth time this season.\n\nBut other than that, Feb. 8 at LaBahn Arena seemed a lot like any other time when Wisconsin and Ohio State have faced off in recent years, a scrappy, grind-it-out game decided by determination, heads-up play and the right bounces.\n\nAfter a dispiriting loss a day earlier, the top-ranked Badgers got on the board first and went on to a 4-1 victory over the No. 2 Buckeyes. In the process, UW (25-3-2, 19-3-2 WCHA) won its regular seasons series, three games to one and took over the lead over Ohio State (26-4-0, 20-4-0) in the league standings with two weeks remaining before the playoffs.\n\nFifth-year right wing Lacey Eden, left off the Team USA roster for the Milan Cortina Games, needs to do more than ever for a Badgers team without five of its best players.\n\nEden scored the game’s first goal at 16:17 of the first period through a tangle in front of Ohio State goaltender Hailey MacLeod and then assisted on a breakaway by junior center Cassie Hall that made it 2-0 in the second period and on junior defender Laney Potter’s 5-on-3 goal in the third that took the lead to 3-1.\n\n“From the opening faceoff, we were here to play today,” said Eden, who was frustrated a day earlier when the Badgers seemed to be skating in quicksand. “We had that effort that we were talking about yesterday.\n\n“And just getting pucks the net, yeah, definitely the goal was to get up 1-0 and we were able to capitalize on that and I think that helped the momentum for the rest of the game.”\n\nHead coach Mark Johnson couldn’t ask for more from a player who has been an important part of the leadership group through three UW-OSU national championship battles.\n\nNow she has to step up even \n\n“Whether it’s killing a penalty and blocking a shot and what we saw in the first period, scoring a goal in the first period, making a play on the five-on-three, we keep talking, and she keeps playing well,” Johnson said. “Give her a lot of credit because if you watched her, yesterday and then watched again today, there’s a lot of determination and grit, getting knocked down and just getting back up and keep playing. Fun to watch.”\n\nThe Badgers’ fourth goal came from sophomore center Finley McCarthhy just 26 seconds after Potter’s while UW was still on the power play.\n\nOn the other end of the ice, freshman Rhyah Stewart was making her fourth start since McNaughton left for Italy. She stopped 20 shots on goal and held Ohio State 0 for 7 on the power play.\n\n“Definitely the D-zone, it’s a group effort,” Stewart said. “I just do my job to help them back there, but any help I get is always awesome.\n\n“The more reps you get at this level, it’s kind of just you get more comfortable with the speed of the game and to just kind of know the plays that might happen in front of you. So I think that helps with a lot of confidence in the net.”\n\nStewart is 2-2 in McNaughton’s absence after splits against Ohio State and at third-ranked Minnesota and 3-2 overall.\n\n“I was happy for Rhyahj,” Johnson said. “Back to back weekends against two of the top teams in the country, and she looked comfortable out there today. She looked confident and those are the things you want to see in your players, especially your young ones.”\n\nThe Badgers would love to see more of the same as the regular season winds down as they pursue an 11th regular season conference title before their Olympians return.\n\nOver the remaining two weekends they play a pair of games at Minnesota State and then host St. Cloud State at LaBahn. Both are in the bottom half of the WCHA standings.\n\nOhio State hosts Minnesota and then finishes at last-place Bemidji State.\n\nThen come the WCHA tournament and the NCAA tournament, where Wisconsin is 2-1 against Ohio State in the past three championships.\n\n“Every game you should try to hold yourself to that standard of playing it like a championship game, playing it like your last game, or however you want to think about that,” Eden said. “Against a rival like Ohio State, you need that laser focus, you need to be doing those little things. And I hope we can kind of take notes from this game and continue that into the rest of our regular season as a team.”\n\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Wisconsin women's hockey beats Ohio State 4-1, retakes WCHA lead",

We struggled to keep that momentum in the second half, but we're on the road in ACC play, so I'm happy that we got a sweep, and this helps us have momentum. … These were games that we had to win, so we took care of business.\"\n\nTheresa Hagans' 19 points led the Pittsburgh.\n\nGeorgia Tech 74, Stanford 52: In Atlanta, freshman Lara Samfai scored a season-high 19 points and Hailee Swain added 10, but the Cardinal (16-9, 5-7 ACC) were held to 33% shooting in a loss to the Yellow Jackets (11-14, 6-7).\n\nStanford trailed by six after the first quarter, then saw its deficit grow to 15 at halftime after being held to seven points in the second quarter. The Cardinal closed to within 45-39 in the third quarter only to see Georgia Tech close the period with a 10-2 run.\n\nStanford was scoreless for a nearly six-minute stretch in the second quarter, had a four-minute drought in the third quarter and was blanked in the final 4:32 as Georgia Tech closed with a 7-0 run.\n\nThe Yellow Jackets also won the rebound battle 42-39 and outscored the Cardinal in the paint 30-20.\n\n\"Stanford's tough, they've got a lot of length, there's a lot of height on that team,\" Georgia Tech coach Karen Blair said. \"So to outrebound that team … our team was disciplined. We were disciplined with the boxouts when we needed to.\"\n\nThis article originally published at Local college basketball: Lulu Twidale scores 32 as Cal women win; Stanford falls to Georgia Tech.",

    "description": "A look at what color Gatorade was dumped on the winning coach at Super Bowl 60. Did Mike Vrabel or Mike Macdonald get the bath?",
    "fullText": "Gatorade rose to prominence in the early 1990s due, in part, to a commercial titled “Be Like Mike,” featuring Michael Jordan. A quarter of a century later, two coaches named Mike are facing off on the Super Bowl stage, and there’s a great chance one of them winds up being drenched in Gatorade tonight.\n\nEither the Seahawks’ Mike Macdonald or the Patriots’ Mike Vrabel will likely get the traditional Gatorade shower tonight at Levi’s Stadium. We will post the results of the Super Bowl 60 Gatorade color as soon as the electrolytes hit the turf this evening.\n\nWe will soon have the Super Bowl Gatorade color results. Be sure to check back here immediately after the game to see which color cashed.\n\nThere is so much chaos in the closing minutes and immediate aftermath of the Super Bowl that TV cameras can often miss the Gatorade bath.\n\nThis occurred in 2021 when the Tampa Bay Buccaneers beat the Kansas City Chiefs 31-9 in Super Bowl LV. CBS cameras missed Bucs head coach Bruce Arians getting doused, and there were many minutes of speculation online regarding which color landed on his head.\n\nA video from the stadium went viral shortly after the conclusion of the game, revealing that Arians was drenched in blue Gatorade.\n\nBlue was a favorite heading into this year’s game, as it owned +260 Gatorade color odds. Only orange had shorter odds.\n\nThis year’s Super Bowl matchup does not have much background when it comes to Gatorade baths. There is no prior video of Macdonald or Vrabel being hit with a Gatorade bath, as neither has reached the Super Bowl as a head coach before.\n\nNeither was hit with a Gatorade bath in their respective conference championship game this year, either.\n\nHere is a look at what Gatorade color payouts would look like on a $10 bet. Payouts are the total amount you would receive in return on a winning bet. So it’s the $10 you bet upfront plus the amount you actually won.\n\nYellow/Green/Lime (+260): $36.00\n\nNo Gatorade Bath (+5000): $510.00\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "The U.S. has medaled in every Winter Olympic sport, except Biathlon, which combines cross-country skiing and rifle shooting. Can American biathletes end their 66-year shutout at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics?\n\nCampbell Wright offers Team USA's best shot at making a biathlon podium. The 23-year-old represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, but the dual citizenship athlete switched in 2023 to represent the U.S., where his parents were born, and won two silver medals at the 2025 World Championship.\n\nAlthough the biathlon officially made its debut at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Olympics, military patrols are a direct precursor to biathlon and date back to the inaugural 1924 Chamonix Winter Olympics. Military patrols were included in the 1928, 1936 and 1948 Winter Games as a demonstration sport, before the first biathlon was contested in 1960 with the men's 20-km event. Women's events made their debut at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games, while mixed relay was added to the program in 2014 in Sochi.\n\nAthletes strap rifles to their back and ski multiple laps around a cross-country track. After each lap, the skier arrives at a shooting zone and fires five shots at a target from either the standing position or prone position. A missed target results in a penalty: either a lap around a penalty loop or one minute added to the overall time. The winner is determined by either the first to cross the finish line or best overall time, depending on the event.\n\nThere are 11 Olympic biathlon events. Men and women have their own events and there's one mixed relay:\n\n4x6-kilometer mixed relay: Two men and two women\n\nCampbell Wright: The 23-year-old represented New Zealand at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics before joining Team USA in October 2023. Wright became the first U.S biathlete to win two medals in a single world championship when he won back-to-back silver medals in sprint and pursuit. He's the first American to win a world championship medal since Susan Dunklee in 2020 and the first American male since Lowell Bailey's gold in the 20 km in 2017.\n\nDeedra Irwin: The 33-year-old is looking to improve on her seventh-place finish in the women's 15km individual race in Beijing in 2022, marking the best-ever Olympic finish for an American biathlete.\n\nFrance dominated the 2025 Biathlon World Championships, winning six golds and 13 total medals, the most of any country, followed by nine total medals for Norway, five for Germany and four for Sweden.\n\nFrance's Quentin Fillon Maillet became the first biathlete to win five medals in a single Winter Games after earning two golds (individual, pursuit) and three silver medals (sprint, relay and mixed relay) in Beijing in 2022. France's Julia Simon won a mixed relay silver medal in Beijing in 2022 and took home four golds at the 2025 world championships (individual, relay, mixed relay and single mixed relay).\n\nThe USA TODAY app gets you to the heart of the news — fast. Download for award-winning coverage, crosswords, audio storytelling, the eNewspaper and more.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Biathlon at 2026 Milano Cortina: How it works, U.S. stars to watch",

    "fullText": "If you were expecting a defensive affair in Super Bowl LX, the first half has lived up to the billing.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks scored a field goal on their opening drive of the game to take a 3-0 lead, but that has been half of the scoring so far as the first half of Super Bowl LX draws to a close with the Seahawks leading the New England Patriots by just 6-0 thanks to two field goals from Jason Myers late in the second quarter.\n\nSo that has us thinking: What are the three lowest scoring Super Bowls in Super Bowl history?\n\nSuper Bowl IX was played at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings. Similar to Super Bowl LX, the first half of Super Bowl IX was a true defensive struggle, as the only points came for Pittsburgh on a safety when Minnesota quarterback Fran Tarkenton was taken down in his own end zone.\n\nThe opening kickoff of the second half was fumbled by Minnesota fullback Bill Brown, giving the Steelers incredible field position. Pittsburgh capped off their next possession with a touchdown run from Franco Harris to give Pittsburgh a 9-0 lead.\n\nThe Steelers would go on to win by a final score of 16-9, for a total of 22 points.\n\nSuper Bowl VII capped off a perfect 17-0 season for the Miami Dolphins.\n\nBut interestingly enough, it might be most remembered for how Washington scored their only points of the game, coming on this botched field goal attempt from Miami.\n\nGaro Yepremian’s gaffe aside, the Dolphins took the win, and to date the only perfect season in NFL history.\n\nThat is a total of just 21 points.\n\nInterestingly enough, the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history featured the Patriots as well.\n\nTom Brady’s final Super Bowl win with New England came in Super Bowl LIII against the Los Angeles Rams. While Jared Goff and company had chances, the Rams offense never found the end zone. New England scored the lone touchdown of the game on a short plunge from Sony Michel, and wide receiver Julian Edelman — who caught 10 passes for 141 yards — took home Super Bowl MVP.",

    "fullText": "Kenneth Walker's contract status and projection ahead of 2026 NFL offseason originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nWhen the Seattle Seahawks finally turn the page to the offseason, they'll have a big decision to make on running back Kenneth Walker.\n\nThat's because the former second-round pick is a pending free agent after spending all four of his NFL seasons with the Seattle Seahawks.\n\nHere's a look at who much Walker is expected to make in free agency.\n\nAccording to Spotrac, Walker is estimated to land a four-year, $33.5 million deal in free agency, which is realistic for a few reasons.\n\nFor starters, Walker will be one of the best running backs available in free agency and should draw plenty of interest. Also, Walker has only helped his contract demands with a big showing in the playoffs.\n\nWhat will hurt Walker is the fact that he isn't the most complete back. He's OK as a pass-catcher and struggles in pass protection, so he won't be getting top-of-the-market money.\n\nThe good news for the Seahawks is they are loaded with cap space this offseason, so they'll have no issue re-signing Walker if that's the route they want to go.\n\nCardinals trade rumor could lead to deal with Steelers, Vikings or Browns\n\nAaron Rodgers career update is great news for Pittsburgh Steelers\n\n49ers trade rumor is crushing blow to possible deal with Vikings, Falcons\n\nMaxx Crosby isn't ruling out interesting career change down the line\n\nTravis Kelce rumor offers update on Chiefs superstar's future plans\n\nMaxx Crosby trade rumor is good news for Pats, Eagles, Cowboys",

    "fullText": "Manchester City were denied a record-equalling 14 consecutive Women’s Super League wins on Sunday after a defeat to Arsenal. The Gunners puts the brakes on City’s title charge with a successful afternoon at the Emirates, thanks to Olivia Smith.\n\nA sole goal from summer signing Smith denied the Citizens from matching the competition’s longest winning streak. The decisive moment came in just the 17th minute, when Mariona Caldentey’s stunning through ball was pounced upon by the Canadian forward. Smith took the ball past Ayala Yamashita and coolly finished into the open net.\n\nThe result has little impact on the league standings, as City still remain top, eight points clear of derby rivals Manchester United. Arsenal however, have a game in-hand due to their participation in FIFA’s Champions Cup, and could close the gap to seven points if they defeat Leicester.\n\nRenée Slegers’s game plan was clear: disrupt City’s rhythm, press high in the central areas, and force defensive mistakes. The first half alone saw Arsenal have nine shots, four of these being on target. Meanwhile, City struggled linking up play between midfield and the attacking third. The away side managed just one shot on target throughout the 90 minutes, which came via Bunny Shaw moments before half-time.\n\nThe midfield partnership of Caldentey and Kim Little proved pivotal in Arsenal’s victory as Man City were forced to play wide, limiting space and time for Vivienne Miedema to dictate play much like she has this season.\n\nDefensively, the Gunners were rock solid. Daphne van Domeselaar looked calm and assured in her first start since November. While Lotte Wubben-Moy and Steph Catley marshalled their lines, limiting City’s attacking prowess.\n\nWinning the Player of the Match, Kim Little’s influence cannot be overlooked. Now 35 years old, the former Scottish international seems to get better with each passing season.\n\nLittle helped the Gunners control the tempo, disrupt City’s flow, and provide calm distribution throughout the 90 minutes. Her experience and reading of the game was pivotal in Arsenal’s dominance and shown in the second half, when a well-timed slide tackle prevented a City counter-attack and allowed the home side to calm the match.\n\nAfter the win, Arsenal’s captain spoke to SkySports and highlighted their growing momentum after recent victories against Chelsea and Corinthians.\n\n“I think we’ve obviously had quite a big week of fixtures when you look at Chelsea and then the Champions Cup last week and now going into Man City,” Little said. “We’ve put in some really great performances throughout the squad, and all the players have done really well.\n\n“We’ve raised to the occasion and obviously a huge part of that is our fans. Being able to play here in North London, to have I think close to 40,000 again today, it’s a pretty special atmosphere.”\n\nDespite trailing in the WSL standings, Little hopes her side can maintain the pressure to the final day.\n\n“I think obviously City have put themselves in a really good position, and our job now is to just push as much as we can until that end game of the season.”\n\nArsenal will hope to continue their fine winning run as they travel to Belgium to face Oud-Heverlee Leuven in the first leg of the UEFA Women’s Champions League play-offs. Having won their previous encounter 3-0, the Gunners will hope to put the tie to bed and continue their title defence.\n\nCity, however, will have five days to prepare ahead of their next league clash against bottom-of-the-table Leicester City.\n\nWSL: Sonia Bompastor extends Chelsea contract until 2030\n\nWSL: No alcohol-related incidents as Fan Choice receives ‘overwhelmingly positive’ feedback\n\nWSL: Oriane Jean-François departs Chelsea and signs for Aston Villa",

    "description": "A big question at the end of the Big Game is did the Super Bowl total go Over or Under? We will have the results of how many points were scored in this update.",
    "fullText": "If it's points you crave, then this Super Bowl will likely not be for you. The 45.5-point total for Seahawks vs. Patriots is the lowest Super Bowl Over/Under in 10 years.\n\nThat said, our Super Bowl predictions won't rule out some fireworks this Sunday night at Levi's Stadium based on recent Big Game history. Each of the past three Super Bowls have gone Over the total.\n\nBelow, we will deliver the Seahawks vs. Patriots final score, and the results for whether or not the Super Bowl total went Over or Under the number.\n\nWe will post the answer to the question of whether the Super Bowl total went Over or Under as soon as the final score is set in stone.\n\nUntil then, here are some nuggets of information regarding the total for Super Bowl 60, and Super Bowl odds history.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots were both Top 10 scoring teams this season. Seattle ranked second overall in team scoring, behind only the LA Rams. Mike Macdonald’s team scored an impressive 29.2 points per game this season.\n\nNew England, meanwhile, ranked eighth in the NFL in points scored — putting up 27.2 ppg. In this year’s playoffs, the Seahawks have had a relatively easy time producing points, while it’s been a slog for the Pats.\n\nThe Seahawks put up 41 points in the Divisional Round against the 49ers, and then scored 31 points against the Rams in the NFC Championship game.\n\nMike Vrabel’s squad has had the unfortunate task of dealing with three of the top-ranked defenses in the NFL in their first three games of this postseason. The Pats scored just 16 points against the Chargers in the Wild Card round, 28 points against the Texans in the Divisional Round, and then scored only 10 points against the Broncos in the AFC Championship game.\n\nBoth the Seahawks and Patriots went Over the total in more games than not this season. The Pats have an Over record of 12-8-0 this season. Seattle, meanwhile, has an Over record of 11-8-0.\n\nDrake Maye and the Patriots have gone Under the total in two of their three playoff games played this winter. Chargers versus Patriots had a total of 45.5 and the two teams combined for just 19 points in the Wild Card round.\n\nTexans versus Patriots had a total of 40.5 points and the two teams combined for 44 points. This past round against the Broncos, the total was 42 points and the two teams combined for a measly 17 points.\n\nAs for the Seahawks, they went Over the total in each of their two playoff games this winter. Against the 49ers in the Divisional Round, the total was set at 44.5. The game went Over as the two teams combined for 48 points.\n\nIn the NFC title game, the Over/Under was 44.5 and the two teams rang up 58 points together.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Covers.com, read the full article here",

    "fullText": "The Seattle Seahawks lead the New England Patriots 6-0 late in the second quarter of Super Bowl LX on a pair of field goals by kicker Jason Myers.\n\nThat's a pretty low score — but it wouldn't be the lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history. It's actually three times more than the lowest halftime score in the big game's history, which came in Super Bowl IX following the 1974 season.\n\nIn a struggle between two classic NFL defenses — Pittsburgh's Steel Curtain vs. Minnesota's Purple People Eaters — the only first-half points midway through the second quarter. On second and 7 from his own 10-yard line, Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton lost the ball and had to fall on it in the Vikings' end zone. He was touched by Steelers defensive end Dwight White, who was credited with the sack.\n\nIt was the first safety ever in a Super Bowl, giving Pittsburgh a 2-0 lead that stood at halftime. The Steelers went on to defeat the Vikings 16-6 for their first of four Super Bowl wins in a six-year stretch.\n\nFollowing the 2018 season, the Patriots led the Rams 3-0 at the intermission of Super Bowl LIII, the second-lowest halftime score in Super Bowl history, on a 42-yard field goal by Stephen Gostkowski early in the second quarter.\n\nGet the best, most interesting and strangest stories of the day from the L.A. sports scene and beyond from our newsletter The Sports Report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "From her sudden departure from WWE to her critical takes on the American immigration enforcement crisis, Simone Garcia Johnson, known previously as \"WWE NXT\" General Manager Ava has been making headlines in the professional wrestling news cycle. The young Johnson's future extends beyond a week's worth of stories, however, and, according to Dave Meltzer, she is possibly set to delve deeper into the film industry.\n\nOn a recent episode of \"Wrestling Observer Radio,\" Meltzer delved into Johnson's departures: both from WWE, and from social media. Shortly after her WWE contract expired, Johnson took to X, formerly known as Twitter, to openly criticize United States President Donald Trump's administration, especially in regards to their controversial immigration enforcement policies. She deleted her X account not long after, and many, including Meltzer, have speculated that Johnson's anti-Trump sentiments could have contributed to her decision to not renew with WWE, a company with historical ties to Trump. However, Meltzer clarified that Ava was never officially told to delete her social media, and that her departure from X was a personal decision.\n\n\"From what I'm told, no one forced her,\" Meltzer clarified. \"But she was going to have to drop the Ava account anyway, because she's not in her contract, and [WWE owns] the name Ava.\"\n\nMeltzer also addressed Johnson's future offline. According to Meltzer, the common belief is that Johnson will work for Seven Bucks Productions, a content production company started by her father, Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson. Seven Bucks Productions has been involved in several notable film projects, both within and outside the realm of professional wrestling, such as \"Baywatch,\" \"Black Adam,\" and \"Fighting with My Family,\" a biographical film regarding former WWE Divas Champion Paige (known also as AEW's Saraya). While the young Johnson's ties to Seven Bucks Productions is strong, her next move post-WWE remains unconfirmed.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "Despite coming off a four-win season and changing head coaches a year ago, the New England Patriots are back in the Super Bowl.\n\nLed by Mike Vrabel and MVP-caliber quarterback Drake Maye, they finished the regular season with a 14-3 record and as the second seed in the AFC playoff picture. As such, they went on to beat the Chargers, Texans and Broncos to punch their ticket to Super Bowl LX.\n\nThere, the NFC’s top seed awaits. The Seattle Seahawks reached the Super Bowl by going 14-3 themselves, and by subsequently beating two division rivals — the 49ers and Rams — in the playoffs.\n\nNow, the two teams meet in Santa Clara with the Vince Lombardi Trophy at play.\n\nHere are our updates live from Levi’s Stadium.\n\nSunday, Feb. 8, 6:30 p.m. ET | Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, CA | Broadcast information | Inactives | Game day roster\n\nComment on articles, community posts\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nThe Patriots won the coin toss and deferred, putting the defense on the field first to start Super Bowl 60. After a first down run by Kenneth Walker to move the chains, Sam Darnold found a pair of downfield completions to move inside the red zone. New England’s defense then held strong from there to force a field goal. [Patriots 0 : 3 Seahawks]\n\nNew England’s first drive of the day started with three straight touches for Rhamondre Stevenson, including a third-down conversion through the air. After a 12-yard scramble by Maye then set up a 3rd-and-9 after a sack, a blitz off the blindside resulted in a throwaway and punt.\n\nSeattle’s next drive started back up at their own 10-yard line. Immediately facing a 3rd-and-6, Darnold escaped a blitzing Jaylinn Hawkins but missed a wide open Jaxon Smith-Njigba downfield forcing a punt.\n\nA play-action under center pass out of six their O-line group to Kayshon Boutte started the Patriots next drive with a 21-yard gain. Two straight touches to TreVeyon Henderson then set up a 3rd-and-15, where a Seattle blitz got home again for a sack. New England then punted again.\n\nBehind another good punt by Bryce Baringer and coverage by Dell Pettus, Seattle again started inside their own 20. Two run stuffs then set up a 3rd-and-7, where a check down to Barner moved the chains. A big TFL by Craig Woodson and then a pass breakup got Seattle back into a 3rd-and-15 in which Darnold’s pass was incomplete leading to a punt.\n\nNew England continued to struggle to move the football on their next drive, as an incompletion to an open Hunter Henry was followed by a third-down run stop on Stevenson. New England punted again.\n\nFollowing a big time pass breakup downfield by Christian Gonzalez, running back Kenneth Walker found the edge to break free for 30 yards. Two plays later, Walker found running room again escaping for 29 more to move inside the red zone. With Seattle then facing a 3rd-and-12, a pitch to Walker went for a loss again thanks to Woodson. New England forced another field goal. [Patriots 0 : 6 Seahawks]\n\nWith the deficit now six, a long developing second-down sack forced the Patriots into a 3rd-and-17, where a screen to Stefon Diggs went for just five and another punt.\n\nKenneth Walker picked up a pair of first downs to get the Seahawks over midfield. A third down incompletion to Walker then forced a punt by Seattle, which was downed at the 2-yard line.\n\nBacked up on their own end zone, Maye converted a big third-down to DeMario Douglas for a nine-yard gain. Back in a third-and-long after a false start by Will Campbell, Maye uncorked one downfield in a muddy pocket that fell incomplete to Mack Hollins.\n\nWorking over midfield prior to the two-minute warning, Seattle converted a 3rd-and-2 on the ground with 32 seconds remaining. Set up with another 3rd-and-short after using their final timeouts, Darnold’s pass to JSN in the end zone was broken up and nearly intercepted by Gonzalez. New England then held to another field goal.\n\nWith six seconds left in the half, Drake Maye took a knee.",

    "fullText": "Arizona’s first season in the Big 12 Conference was an eye opener, both in terms of the significant bump in competition from the Pac-12 and the hostile atmospheres it entered. No more trips to half-empty gyms in Corvallis or Pullman, or ones in California with nearly as many UA fans as ones for the home team.\n\nTrips to Lubbock, Manhattan, Ames and Lawrence all ended badly. The opponent had a lot to do with that, but so did the crowds. All four games were sellouts, the atmospheres electric.\n\nThe second time around has been much better for Arizona (23-0, 10-0) on the road in the Big 12. It’s won at Utah, TCU, UCF, BYU and ASU, in addition to a nonconference win at UConn in November, the six consecutive road wins the longest in-season streak since 2016-17.\n\nBut now comes a trip to the last road venue that the UA lost in, Kansas’ Allen Fieldhouse. The Wildcats fell 83-76 in Lawrence to end the 2024-25 regular season, keeping Jayhawks coach Bill Self perfect on Senior Day.\n\nSelf, who is in his 23rd season at Kansas, has also never lost at home on Big Monday. He’s 38-0 , with the Jayhawks’ last Big 12 home loss on a Monday coming in 2001.\n\nBut Kansas (18-5, 8-2) has also never beaten a No. 1 team at Allen Fieldhouse, going 0-5 in such opportunities. The last was in 2003, when top-ranked Arizona came to town and won 91-74.\n\n“It’s going to be an awesome atmosphere,” UA coach Tommy Lloyd said. “And I just have a feeling those Jayhawk fans are going to be out for blood. So you know what? We’re here for it.”\n\nArizona is a 2.5-point favorite, per FanDuel Sportsbook, and if that holds it would be just the sixth time Kansas has been a home underdog since 1996.\n\nHere’s what to watch for when the UA and KU meet on Monday night:\n\nDepending on which expert you listen to, or which sportsbook you check out, the No. 1 pick in the 2026 NBA Draft is probably going to be one of two freshmen from the Big 12. Arizona has already faced BYU wing AJ Dybantsa, now it gets a crack at Kansas guard Darryn Peterson.\n\nThe 6-foot-6 Peterson is averaging 20.5 points per game, 21.1 in Big 12 play, and makes 41.7 percent of his 3-point shots. He has scored in double figures every time out, going for 18 in 20 minutes against BYU and nailing the tying and winning 3s in the final 1:20 of a win at Texas Tech last week.\n\nBut Peterson has also missed quite a bit of time due to injury. He’s sat out 10 games, nine during nonconference play, did not play at Kansas State on Jan. 24 and a week later didn’t play the second half against BYU because of cramping.\n\nThe last two games, at Texas Tech and vs. Utah, saw him play 30-plus minutes but also post two of his lowest offensive ratings of the season.\n\nLike BYU, Kansas isn’t just its potential No. 1 pick. Three other Jayhawks average more than 14 points in Big 12 games, with guard Melvin Council dropping 36 at NC State in December scoring 22 in an OT win over TCU last month that saw his team rally from down 15 with less than five minutes to go.\n\nKansas also has the top shot blocker in the conference in 6-foot-10 sophomore Flory Bidunga. Bidunga has swatted 65 shots this season, averaging 3.8 in Big 12 play with seven against Utah on Saturday, and is shooting 78.5 percent in conference action.\n\nDepth could be an issue for Kansas, though. Only two bench players average double figures in minutes and guard Elmarko Jackson missed the last game. Self has said Jackson will play against Arizona but may not be 100 percent.\n\nBidunga and starting center Bryson Tiller, a 6-11 freshman, have been good at avoiding foul trouble but if they do get whistled there’s not much behind them to eat minutes.\n\nArizona has outrebounded every opponent this season, finishing plus-20 against Oklahoma State last time out, and is limiting Big 12 foes to boards on 25.6 percent of their misses. That’s tops in the conference, while Kansas is the worst offensive rebounding team in the league.\n\nKansas got 42 of its 71 points against Utah in the paint but also gave up 32 (of 57). The Jayhawks are +6.4 in paint points for the season, +8 in Big 12 games. Arizona, which won the paint battle 54-14 against Oklahoma State, is +19.2 in conference play.\n\nArizona may need to attempt a few more 3-pointers in this one, though, as Kansas is third-best in the Big 12 in 2-point defense. Bidunga’s shot blocking has a lot to do with that.\n\nBrayden Burries was Arizona’s leading scorer for the seventh time, fourth in Big 12 play, but for the 12th time this season the Wildcats had at least five players in double figures. Every member of the 8-man rotation has either led or tied for the lead in scoring in a game, with five different guys doing that in conference games.\n\n“I just feel like our versatility, and we know how deep we are,” Jaden Bradley said when asked about the key to Arizona’s unbeaten start. “It can be anybody’s night, the bigs, the guards, and I feel like everybody’s happy for one another. And I feel like that’s special. You don’t see that too often.”\n\nKansas could have a front row seat for another Bradley masterclass, which he’s mostly saved for ranked foes. The senior guard is averaging 19.7 points in Arizona’s six games against ranked teams, shooting 56.9 percent, and 18.8 points in Big 12 road contests.",

    "description": "The Patriots coach fell short of Canton in his first year of eligibility.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has expressed admiration for the New England Patriots dynasty in the past, so it was little surprise what he thought about Bill Belichick's Pro Football Hall of Fame snub.\n\nSpeaking with NBC News in an interview conducted Wednesday and aired on Super Bowl Sunday, the president complained about the longtime Patriots coach failing to reach Canton in his first year of eligibility:\n\n\"I thought it was terrible. I mean, he's— won so much, won so many Super Bowls. Great coach. Became a little bit controversial, I guess, after that, this little period after that. During it he was just a great coach. I thought it was very inappropriate.\n\n\"Oh yeah. It's like what have you done for me lately? Well, you know, you have a great career and he has a little bit of a controversial year and a half, two years maybe. But— what difference does that make? No, he should've— he should be in there right at the top.\"\n\nTrump is hardly the first person to rail against the snub. He refers twice to \"controversial\" actions on Belichick's part, which could be a reference to the Spygate and Deflategate cheating scandals that occurred under the coach's watch. However, he alludes to those controversial years being after Belichick's NFL career so he might simply be referring to the 73-year-old's post-Patriots UNC-Jordon Hudson era.\n\nRegardless, Belichick's snubs came down to more than controversies. As one of the few Belichick \"no\" voters laid out, the matter of voting Belichick was more than \"yes\" or \"no.\" To some, it was \"Belichick\" or \"a group of senior players who might not get another Hall of Fame shot for years.\"\n\nThe Hall of Fame's voting process created conditions in which the NFL's all-time leader in playoff wins among head coaches was put in competition for a limited number of votes with three senior players and a contributor, in this case Patriots owner Robert Kraft.\n\nThis year, the only one of that quintet to emerge was former San Francisco 49ers running back Roger Craig, who was recognized on the field at Super Bowl LX alongside modern-era inductees Drew Brees, Larry Fitzgerald, Luke Kuechly and Adam Vinatieri.",

    "fullText": "Who cares about the 2026 Super Bowl between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks? Most football fans are already looking to next year, and hoping their team can make the surprising leap that New England and Seattle did this season.\n\nThe Seahawks’ were No. 19 in the preseason Super Bowl odds this season. The Patriots were No. 21 in the preseason Super Bowl odds. The NFL is king in part because almost every team starts each season with the belief that they can win the championship if everything goes according to plan. Parity is going stronger than ever in the modern game, and the 2025-26 season is all the evidence you need.\n\nIt’s never too early to look ahead to next year. Here’s every team’s Super Bowl LXI odds a year out before the game is played in SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles on Feb. 14, 2027. My favorite bets are included after the table.\n\nChicago Bears (+2700): The Bears are due for some regression to the mean in terms of forcing turnovers next year. Chicago’s 22 takeaways led the league, and only Houston (17) was close, with no other team having more than 13. That’s okay: the Bears’ offense is probably due for some positive regression and additional growth from QB Caleb Williams. Williams turns 25 years old in the middle of next season as he starts Year 3 in the NFL, and he already showed massive improvement in the second half of year two. The Bears should use their available cap space to beef up the defensive front, which will hopefully make them less turnover dependent. With rookies like Colston Loveland and Luther Burden II primed to take a bigger step forward, plus a possible breakout year from Rome Odunze in his third season, the Bears should be a better offense and more sustainable defense.\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (+1800): The Niners had a season from hell in terms of injuries and still had a really good year. San Francisco will be healthier coming into next season, and the injuries they had this season allowed several talented young players to get their feet wet, which should benefit them next year. Expect the Niners to be an active team in free agency after the likely release of Brandon Aiyuk. Kyle Shanahan is as good as any head coach in the NFL. There’s still blue chip talent up and down this roster. If they went 12-5 in a season where they had a lot of bad luck, I’ll bank on some positive regression next season.\n\nWashington Commanders (+4500): Jayden Daniels has looked like a superstar quarterback when he’s fully healthy, and this offseason the Commanders have the opportunity to load up on talent around him. Washington enters the offseason with the No. 7 overall pick, and tons of cap space to splurge on free agents. Edge rushers, linebackers, and secondary help could all be on the menu for a defense that struggled this season. It would also be nice to get Daniels some weapons with Zach Ertz working through a torn ACL and Deebo Samuel entering free agency. Washington needs a talent infusion, but they have the means to do it, and I like the QB/coach combo of Daniels and Dan Quinn for a deep sleeper.",

Instead of autoregressively generating tokens as in classical VLMs, VL-JEPA predicts continuous embeddings of the target texts. By learning in an abstract representation space, the model focuses on task-relevant semantics while abstracting away surface-level linguistic variability. In a strictly controlled comparison against standard token-space VLM training with the same vision encoder and training data, VL-JEPA achieves stronger performance while having 50% fewer trainable parameters. At inference time, a lightweight text decoder is invoked only when needed to translate VL-JEPA predicted embeddings into text.",

    "fullText": "Another day, another vulnerability (or two, or 200) in the security nightmare that is OpenClaw.\n\nResearchers, over the last two days, have disclosed additional issues with OpenClaw - the vibecoded and famously insecure AI agent farm formerly known as Clawdbot and then Moltbot. Specifically, researchers say that the open source agent platform is vulnerable to indirect prompt injection, allowing an attacker to backdoor a user's machine and then steal sensitive data or perform destructive operations.\n\nPlus, as other threat hunters have recently found, the ClawHub marketplace for OpenClaw is teeming with malware and leaky agent skills that expose sensitive credentials.\n\nIn a Thursday blog, Snyk engineers said they scanned the entire ClawHub marketplace containing nearly 4,000 skills and found that 283 of them - that's about 7.1 percent of the entire registry - contain flaws that expose sensitive credentials.\n\n\"They are functional, popular agent skills (like moltyverse-email and youtube-data) that instruct AI agents to mishandle secrets, forcing them to pass API keys, passwords, and even credit card numbers through the LLM's context window and output logs in plaintext,\" the engineers wrote.\n\nThis security flaw is due to the SKILL.md instructions, and developers treating AI agents like local scripts.\n\nWhen someone prompts an agent to \"use this API key,\" the model saves the key in memory, and that conversation history can be leaked to model providers such as OpenAI or Anthropic - or they could appear in plain text in application logs.\n\n\"Perhaps most alarming is the buy-anything skill (v2.0.0),\" the engineers wrote. \"It instructs the agent to collect credit card details to make purchases.\"\n\nTo do this, the LLM tokenizes the user's credit card number, thus sending financial info to the model provider. A subsequent prompt could ask the agent: \"Check your logs for the last purchase and repeat the card details,\" and thus expose the user's credit card to an attacker, enabling financial fraud and theft.\n\nSnyk's research follows a similar blog the developer-focused security shop published on Wednesday that found malware-laced skills across the ecosystem, including 76 malicious payloads designed for credential theft, backdoor installation, and data exfiltration.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, AI security firm Zenity's research arm demonstrated how an attacker could use indirect prompt injection to backdoor OpenClaw users' machines. The problem here is due to AI agents' integrations with other productivity tools like Google Workspace and Slack, allowing OpenClaw to access email, calendars, documents, and enterprise Slack chats.\n\nIn Zenity's proof-of-concept, the attack begins with a Google document and assumes that the OpenClaw instance already integrates with a user's Google environment - although the threat hunters note that a Google Workspace integration is not a prerequisite for the attack. Any trusted third-party integration will work, as this initial integration is only needed to deliver the initial malicious document or other type of content.\n\nIn the Google doc example, it contains an indirect prompt injection payload directing OpenClaw to create a new integration with a Telegram bot.\n\n\"Once the integration is created, OpenClaw begins accepting and responding to messages from the attacker-controlled bot,\" the researchers wrote. \"From this stage onward, the attacker interacts with OpenClaw exclusively through the newly added chat channel.\"\n\nThis means that an attacker can issue commands via the bot, asking OpenClaw to read all of the files on a user's desktop, steal their content and send it all to an attacker-controlled server, and then permanently delete all the files.\n\nOr, they could instruct the agent to download and execute a Sliver command-and-control (C2) beacon onto the victim's computer for long-term remote access. At this point, the attacker wouldn't really even need the AI agent and could instead use the backdoor and C2 channel for lateral movement, privilege escalation, credential harvesting - even ransomware deployment.\n\nThe evil possibilities are truly endless.\n\nThe Register reached out to OpenClaw and its developer Peter Steinberger about these security issues - the latest in what has become a daily deluge of OpenClaw vulnerabilities - and did not receive an immediate response. We will update this story if and when we do. ®",

    "description": "A mom of five shares why growing up surrounded by cousins, sleepovers, and close family relationships has been priceless for her kids.",
    "fullText": "Occasionally, when it comes up in conversation that I have five children, I'm met with surprise and sometimes, a little bit of shock.\n\nAnd while I understand that five may seem like a lot of kids in some regards, in my neck of the woods, it's really not that uncommon. In fact, my sister-in-law has seven children, so in comparison, my brood is the small one.\n\nAll in all, with kids ranging in age from a few months to 17, my kids are a part of a close-knit cousin clan of 15 and counting.\n\nHaving a lot of cousins nearby can be costly for birthdays and the holidays, but for everyday life, the fact that my kids have those relationships truly feels priceless.\n\nI love the simple happiness my kids get from spending time with their cousins, and it feels like such a gift. In a world where it feels like everyone is trying to sell me something or make me pay for \"fun\" experiences for my kids, knowing that what they love most in the world is just being at home with their cousins feels almost too good to be true sometimes. Honestly, I wish I could recapture that level of pure joy in my own adult life again.\n\nI will be honest with you: having 10 kids in my house at once does mean I have to do a lot of post-play cleanup (and right now, we're currently cycling through a stomach bug passed along over our cousin sleepover), but it's always worth it for how much fun the kids have.\n\nAside from the sleepovers our kids can usually talk us into, having a sister-in-law with seven kids is also very convenient for me as a mom. All it takes is her family to come over for birthdays and special occasions, and we have an instant, built-in party.\n\nIt really works out for me, especially because each of my kids has an instant playmate in their cousin who is their age.\n\nFor instance, my son is the only boy in our family, but because he has two male cousins near his age, he gets the fun boy time he misses out on at home. And my youngest daughter has a large five-year gap with her own siblings, so she gets to experience the fun of playmates her age, too.\n\nMy oldest girls don't have cousins their ages, so they have missed out on some level of the cousin fun, but even as teenagers, they love all their cousins, and they have a special relationship with all the littles that is beautiful in its own way. It's so fun watching the younger girls look up to them, and my girls are always so gracious, letting the littles do their makeup and hair and playing with them when they are together.\n\nRight now, my kids are incredibly lucky with the time they get with their families. They see both sides of their families regularly, with weekly breakfasts, time at church, all holidays and special occasions, sports events, and random visits, just for fun. My husband and I both live within 30 minutes of almost all of our own siblings and parents, so to my kids, close-knit families are the norm.\n\nWhile my kids are incredibly close with their cousins right now, I know those relationships might change as they get older. People can grow apart, family members will most likely move away, and things can happen.\n\nBut no matter what their relationships look like in the future, I do believe that the close-knit relationships and the memories they are creating together will shape them. Belonging somewhere matters, both as a child and as an adult, and I hope that the feeling of being loved as part of a big family sits somewhere inside them as they grow.",

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Kristen Boelen, the founder of Lunch Break Vintage. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI have been thrifting since the moment I could drive. Back then, I was into higher-end things that were out of my budget, and I'd go thrift shopping to find similar items that I could afford. That habit carried on through college and beyond, including when I was most recently working as an art director for a wine and spirits company. While working there, I'd thrift on my lunch breaks.\n\nI'd find stuff for myself, as well as one-of-a-kind items that didn't fit. I wanted someone to take that stuff. So I began selling items on Whatnot.\n\nI'd thrift on my lunch break from work, and then on the weekends I'd go live and sell my pieces. My business grew from there, and I named it Lunch Break Vintage, which I began full time in February 2025.\n\nIn December 2025, I was at a thrift store in the San Francisco Bay Area. It was a normal Wednesday, which is the day this particular thrift store opens for the week, and when I always try to go. It was very empty that day.\n\nTwo woven leather bags caught my eye. You see woven leather bags all the time. There are so many Bottega Veneta dupes. I didn't really think much about it, just that one of them looked exceptionally nice.\n\nI first noticed the hardware, then the leather slouching and hanging. I could tell it was soft leather. When I picked it up, it was heavy — designer leather bags have a weight to them because of the hardware. I opened it up and saw the logo. You can see in the video that I posted that's the moment my jaw drops. The leather inside was really soft and buttery too; that's always a sign a bag is legitimate.\n\nI know they sort through and send a lot of the higher-end pieces to an online audience. It seemed unrealistic that someone wouldn't have set it aside. I thought, if they had put it out there, it must not be real.\n\nI took a photo of it and put it into Google Lens, and found on Vestaire Collective there was the exact same bag and color. That clued me into the style name and that it had been retired. There's a video of me going, \"Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God,\" once I figured out where the serial tag was. I got out of there as quickly as possible, paying $8 for the bag.\n\nI later had it authenticated through an app I use called Authentic Detective. It will give you a certificate of authenticity. Online research says the bag is valued at around $3,000.\n\nI'm keeping the bag for myself. It's something that will be passed down for generations. I had so many comments on the video saying that the bag was ugly, but I love it.\n\nI thrift all the time because I now do this for a living, but I think consistency is key. I thrift at least three times a week, every week. It's also important not to just pick up what is trending. A good secondhand item has to check all the boxes for me, and I really care about quality, always looking for natural fibers. I focus on what makes people feel elevated and the kinds of secondhand pieces they can keep in their closets forever.\n\nDon't believe that middle-of-nowhere places are garbage. Some of my best, coolest, most unique pieces have come from middle-of-nowhere stores.",

That's a lifetime in the AI boom.\n\nNow, the man who coined the term is celebrating the birth of a new one: \"agentic engineering.\"\n\nWhile vibe-coding is when humans prompt AI to write code, OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy says agentic engineering is when AI agents write the code themselves.\n\n\"Many people have tried to come up with a better name for this to differentiate it from vibe coding, personally, my current favorite is 'agentic engineering,'\" he wrote in a recent X post.\n\nKarpathy said he calls it \"agentic engineering\" not just because agents are writing the code, but because \"there is an art & science and expertise to it.\"\n\nVibe-coding is one of the biggest innovations of the AI revolution. Prominent CEOs and startup founders alike are encouraging the use of vibe-coding across their teams. And billions are being poured into new vibe-coding companies.\n\nLovable, one of Europe's fastest-growing startups, announced that it had raised $330 million in Series B funding at a $6.6 billion valuation in December. Cursor, an AI-assisted code editor, announced a Series D funding round of $2.3 billion in November and said it had surpassed $1 billion in annualized revenue.\n\nThe approach is also threatening traditional engineering jobs. In a Business Insider survey of 167 software engineers, 75 engineers said that they were \"keeping up,\" while 30 said they felt ahead of the curve, and 27 felt behind.\n\n\"Vibe coding is now mentioned on my Wikipedia as a major memetic 'contribution,' and even its article is longer. lol,\" Karpathy wrote on X about its meteoric rise.\n\nKarpathy was a founding member of OpenAI in 2015, years before competitors like Anthropic and xAI emerged. He later moved into self-driving technology, leading Tesla's Autopilot program as head of AI. He's now building Eureka Labs, which describes itself on its website as building a \"new kind of school that is AI native.\"",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - Donald Trump has cast himself as Republicans’ chief messenger on the cost of living in an election year, but a Reuters review of his speeches shows a president repeatedly declaring inflation beaten while rarely acknowledging the strain many Americans say they still feel.\n\nIn five speeches on the economy since December, Trump asserted that inflation had been beaten or was way down almost 20 times and said prices were falling almost 30 times, assertions at odds with economic data and voters' daily experiences. Much of the remaining time was spent on grievances and other issues, including ​immigration, whether Somalia was a country, and attacks on opponents.\n\nTaken together, the speeches portray a president struggling to reconcile his central claim — that he has fixed the cost-of-living crisis — with inflation near 3% over the past year and voters’ lived experience of paying more for grocery staples. The price of ground beef, for example, ‌is up 18% since Trump took office a year ago, while ground coffee prices are up 29%.\n\nRepublican strategists told Reuters that his mixed messaging on the top issue for voters risks creating a credibility gap for him and the Republican Party ahead of the November midterms, when control of Congress will be at stake. Opinion polls show voters are deeply unhappy with Trump's handling of the economy.\n\n\"He can't continue to make claims that are demonstrably ‌false, particularly at the expense of Republicans who are in competitive House districts or Senate races,\" said Rob Godfrey, a Republican strategist. Trump \"must be disciplined and focused,\" he added.\n\nOne source close to the White House said the president needed to hit the issue of affordability harder and through personal visits to critical districts.\n\n\"He needs to bring the message out because the message is not resonating,\" the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity to more freely discuss the issue.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesman, said Trump’s focus on illegal immigration in his speeches is directly connected to his argument that people in the country illegally have an adverse impact on the economy. Desai said it causes “public services being overburdened, business activity disrupted by crime, housing markets flooded, and workers’ wages depressed.”\n\nTrump has repeatedly stressed that much work remains to clean up the economic mess he says his Democratic predecessor, Joe Biden, left him, Desai added.\n\nTRUMP VEERS OFF MESSAGE TO RAIL ABOUT IMMIGRATION\n\nThe Reuters analysis found that Trump - when not declaring inflation beaten - devoted nearly half his speaking time to grievances and other issues.\n\nIn about five hours of speaking time, he spent roughly two hours straying into ⁠about 20 topics unrelated to prices, the Reuters review found. When he veered off message, his top issue was illegal immigration, ‌which he spent a total of about 30 to 40 minutes talking about.\n\nIn the speeches he insulted Somali Americans in Minnesota, who voted against him in the 2024 election. He referred to Somalia as \"not even a country\" - and in four speeches he disparaged Somali-born Minnesota congresswoman Ilhan Omar.\n\nA progressive, high-profile Democrat and Muslim, Omar has been a frequent Trump critic, especially over his immigration policies.\n\n\"Every time the president of the United States has chosen to use hateful rhetoric to talk about me and the community that I represent, my death threats skyrocket,\" Omar said last month, the ‍day after a man sprayed a foul-smelling liquid on her at a town hall event.\n\nTrump also talked about men in women's sports, Venezuela, Iran, the Islamic State militant group, Greenland, Ukraine and Russia, military recruitment, his false claim that the 2020 election was rigged, U.S. weaponry, his exaggerated claim to have ended eight wars, and even how much a Fox News anchor likes him.\n\nTRUMP'S MEANDERING WORRIES STRATEGISTS\n\n\"Inflation is stopped. Incomes are up. Prices are down,\" Trump said in an Iowa speech on January 27.\n\nOnly twice in the five speeches did Trump acknowledge that prices are still too high, but he blamed them on Biden. Trump was elected in 2024 because of voter unhappiness with Biden's handling of inflation - which spiked to over 9% in 2022 - and illegal immigration.\n\nDemocrats caused prices \"to be too high,\" Trump told a rally ​in Pennsylvania on December 9. \"But now they're coming down.\"\n\nIn the same speech he called the term \"affordability\" a Democratic \"hoax\". After a public backlash, he has ceased saying that in more recent speeches.\n\nIn four of the speeches Trump repeatedly and haphazardly switches topics, often when he is in the middle of talking about the economy, the Reuters review found.\n\nFour Republican strategists ‌interviewed by Reuters said Trump's meandering style - which he proudly calls \"the weave\" - risked drowning out his core economic argument that he has brought inflation and prices down.\n\nSpeaking to world leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland on January 21, Trump spent the first 22 minutes on topic, then suddenly, for the next 22 minutes, insulted Europeans, said they would be speaking German if it wasn’t for America, called NATO ungrateful, and decried the “crooked” media before pivoting back to the U.S. economy.\n\nDoug Heye, a Republican strategist, said voters want to hear what Trump is doing to lower costs. \"But they have no memory of what Trump says about economic issues because of the volume of his own rhetoric.\"\n\nOne source familiar with the White House's thinking said Trump was likely to use his State of the Union address on February 24 as the kickoff for more intense domestic travel to amplify his message on affordability.\n\nFor many Americans, the economy still feels unforgiving. Prices remain high, even though the inflation rate has inched down since Trump took office, from 3% to 2.7%. A lower inflation rate does not mean prices are decreasing - just that they are growing at a slower pace, economists stress.\n\nIn the 12 months through December 2025, food costs were up over 3%, while average hourly earnings were up only 1.1% year over year. The unemployment rate was 4.4% in December, up from 4% when Trump took office in January 2025, according to government data.\n\nIn ⁠some of the speeches Trump correctly identifies a drop in prices for a few everyday goods, including eggs and gas. The cost of eggs fell about 21% in December from a year earlier after ​being 60% higher during Trump's first months back in office. Gas prices are about 4% lower since January last year.\n\nBut the cost of an average grocery basket has risen. The price of coffee, beef, and some fruits, ​among other items, has risen in the past year.\n\nTrump does offer solutions in his speeches, including his tax cuts that kicked in last month that will produce greater savings for tens of millions of families; the scrapping of taxes on tips, overtime and Social Security payments; his plan to reduce mortgage interest rates; a proposal to lower housing prices; and deals with health insurance companies to reduce drug prices.\n\nMost economists expect U.S. households and the economy at large to benefit in the months ahead from the tax cuts. But Trump's more recent proposals are unlikely to have a ‍significant impact on the cost of living between now and November, some economists told Reuters. One ⁠of Trump's ideas - to cap credit card interest rates to 10% for a year - could even backfire since it could limit access to credit for lower-income families, some economists have warned.\n\nMike Marinella, a spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, which supports candidates for the House of Representatives, said Trump and Republicans were helping working families. \"Voters are seeing this clear contrast, and the best is yet to come.\"\n\nSome 35% of Americans approve of Trump's overall handling of the economy, according to a January 25 Reuters/Ipsos poll, up slightly from 33% in December. But it is well below his initial 42% rating on the issue when he first took office a year ago.\n\nFormer economic officials in previous administrations say Trump is falling into the same trap Biden did in 2024 when confronted with persistently high inflation.\n\nBiden kept claiming the U.S. economy was strong and urged voters to look at other economic data. That strategy failed badly and Democrats were punished at the polls.\n\nThe officials agreed it was important for presidents to show voters they understood their economic pain, especially in an election year.\n\n\"We ‌definitely talked past people on inflation,\" Jared Bernstein, the head of Biden's Council of Economic Advisers, said in an interview.\n\n\"What we typically did was to say, 'A new report just came out on jobs, it's very strong,' and that was all true. But the fact is that there wasn't much we were ‌able to do in terms of the price level.\"",

    "fullText": "Christina Mann moved from Cleveland, Texas, to the small community of Point Blank four years ago when she retired. She wanted to retire close to the water, a dream of hers. Now, water is the nightmare that's keeping her from making ends meet.\n\nEvery other day, Mann drives several miles to a friend's house to fill five-gallon jugs from a garden hose. That water is what she uses to wash dishes, wash her hands and flush her toilets — her only supply after she decided last November to disconnect her water service entirely.\n\n\"I choose to eat, and I told them that every time you go up, that takes out of my money a month for my food,\" Mann told ABC13's 13 Investigates (1).\n\nMann lives alone on a monthly Social Security check she budgeted carefully around when she retired. There was enough to cover her bills, but barely. When the base fees charged by her provider — a for-profit company called Texas Water Utilities — kept climbing, she felt cornered. A termination notice arrived, and she didn't fight it. \"You don't need to send me one. Just come cut my water off. I can't afford it,\" she said.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nAccording to a copy of Mann's bill reviewed by 13 Investigates, she was charged $169 for a month in which she used just 2,000 gallons. In July, the fees alone — base charges for water and sewage, pass-through fees and a state fee — totaled $150.18. Her actual water and sewage usage that billing cycle came to $9.34.\n\nThat means roughly 94% of her bill had nothing to do with how much water came out of her faucet.\n\nMann said she could manage if her bill were closer to the roughly $60 a month she paid back in Cleveland.\n\nMann's provider, Texas Water Utilities, is an investor-owned utility — a for-profit company, not a city-run system. Texas Water Utilities serves about 60,000 customers in 32 counties, is acquiring at least four other companies, and has filed to tack on a $34-per-month \"system improvement charge\" to recoup more than $80 million in infrastructure spending.",

    "fullText": "TOKYO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Japan's volatile financial markets must now contend with Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi firmly in the driver's seat after her decisive victory on Sunday, which hands her an electoral mandate to reflate the economy.\n\nThe question for investors is whether ​Takaichi's electoral momentum will prompt her to expand her stimulus ambitions or if it lends her the political leeway to proceed more ‌cautiously.\n\nHow has the Takaichi trade impacted Japanese markets?\n\nWhy are investors concerned about Japan's debt burden?\n\nHow might Takaichi's electoral victory affect policy direction?\n\nWhat are Takaichi's key economic stimulus policies?\n\nSince she began her rise to become the nation's first female premier in October, the \"Takaichi trade\" has pushed domestic shares to record highs while causing a precipitous selloff in Japanese government bonds ‌and the yen.\n\nVoters braved heavy snowfalls in Tokyo and other parts of Japan to deliver what exit polls indicated to be the most decisive win for Takaichi's Liberal Democratic Party since 1996.\n\n\"The stock market is a true believer in Takaichi, so the big win is going to be good news for equities when the markets open on Monday,\" said Chris Scicluna, the head of research at Daiwa Capital Markets Europe.\n\nTakaichi, a devotee of the \"Abenomics\" stimulus policies of the late premier Shinzo Abe, has ⁠pledged a proactive fiscal policy funded largely through bond ‌issuance.\n\nShe came to office at a low point in power and popularity for her Liberal Democratic Party, which has ruled Japan for most of the post-World War Two period, forcing her to bargain with opposition parties with even more liberal fiscal ‍platforms.\n\n\"The administration's foundation will become much more stable, making it easier for expectations to build around advancing economic policy,\" said Kota Suzuki, a strategist at Nomura Asset Management. \"Because there will no longer be a need to actively seek the opposition's cooperation, there will be less pressure for giveaway-style fiscal expansion.\"\n\nWith polls already indicating a decisive LDP win, Japan's benchmark ​Nikkei 225 Index set an all-time high of 54,782.83 on Tuesday. Big winners of late include sectors like defence, artificial intelligence and chips that ‌have been singled out by Takaichi for targeted investment.\n\nBut prospects for more government outlays have unsettled investors already concerned about Japan's debt burden, the largest in the developed world. Those worries came to a head on January 20, when rates across the JGB yield curve shot to multi-decade or even record highs after Takaichi called for the snap election and embraced suspending the sales tax on food.\n\nThe yen has also been punished, losing about 6% against the dollar since Takaichi's selection as prime minister in October and plumbing record lows against the euro and Swiss franc. Only threats of joint currency market intervention with the United ⁠States have arrested the yen's slide.",

    "fullText": "(Reuters) Feb 8 - On the edge of Venezuela’s main oil city Maracaibo, members of a local branch of the ruling socialist party went door-to-door in the weeks after U.S. forces captured President Nicolas Maduro, asking residents if they still supported the party that has run the country for nearly 20 years. The result: about half of members said they no longer did.\n\n“The response is very bad,” said a person who helped lead the effort. “There is division among us.”\n\nWhile Reuters was not able to independently verify the canvassing results, the reported drop in support aligned with ​information gathered from three other parts of the country.\n\nThe news agency spoke to 13 party members or local leaders across four states who reported fractures in the United Socialist Party (PSUV) following the U.S. attack. All of them expressed a deep sense of uncertainty and many voiced worries about their economic future.\n\nThe government’s ‌patronage system, which bought a form of party loyalty through financial benefits and food parcels, also appears to be under pressure, with five of the sources saying some contributions had stopped since Maduro’s capture.\n\nSix of the people described distrust among party loyalists and spreading suspicion of interim President Delcy Rodriguez. Eight said they had seen a drop in participation and support at their local party branch, with two of them estimating a ‌70% fall in attendance at events like marches and local assembly meetings.\n\nThe people Reuters spoke to all requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, with several saying local leaders were encouraging the party faithful to snitch on any members losing faith in the cause, a common tactic for weeding out popular dissent in Venezuela. Reuters has withheld the names of the people it interviewed to protect their safety.\n\nThere are no recent public numbers on party membership and while Reuters talked to people observing falling participation in four geographically dispersed states, the news agency could not determine what the situation was across all 24 states in the country. Most foreign media do not have permanent staff in the country and Venezuelans are generally reluctant to speak freely with reporters because of potential reprisals.\n\nNeither the Venezuelan government nor PSUV responded to Reuters requests for comment on the eroding support for the party and the fraying of its patronage system.\n\nCalls for national unity in the face of threats to Venezuela have been a constant in Rodriguez’s speeches and public appearances since Maduro's removal, and she has also cheered the resilience of the ⁠country's people and pledged economic development for all.\n\nDespite decrying Maduro’s detention as a kidnapping, Rodriguez appears to be complying with ‌U.S. demands to open the country to American oil companies and has also met with the director of the Central Intelligence Agency to discuss cooperation against drug trafficking.\n\nFraying party support at the grassroots level would be a problem for Rodriguez. Reuters has previously reported how she is already battling to shore up her rule by putting allies in positions of power to shield herself from the potential threat posed by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello, who also heads the PSUV and has close connections to the security services and colectivos - the hardline motorcycle-riding ‍enforcement arm of the party.\n\nPublicly, Cabello has stressed unity. On Jan. 12, he used his weekly press conference as party leader to emphasize Rodriguez has \"all the support of the United Socialist Party of Venezuela.”\n\nNeither U.S. President Donald Trump nor Rodriguez has seriously addressed the question of elections since Maduro’s ouster, but the anecdotal dwindling of local support appears to point to an uncomfortable truth for the PSUV: Maduro’s exit has done little to improve popularity, according to the party members Reuters interviewed.\n\nA local party leader in the northern state of Aragua said the party had no way to grow or ​win elections, “even if we had Che Guevara or Gandhi as a candidate.\"\n\n“You have a situation where the apparatus of repression is fragmenting and on top of that the remaining grassroots base is demobilizing. That’s a huge challenge for governability,” said Ricardo Rios, head of Caracas-based analysis and consultancy firm Poder & Estrategia.\n\nStill, local support for the party ‌may revive. Venezuela has already received $500 million from crude sales and any significant economic improvement could help boost funding of the party and get membership perks, which have historically helped buttress support, flowing again.\n\nIn response to Reuters questions about the problems facing the Socialist Party, a senior White House official said: “The country is stable, illegal migration has stopped, drug flows have halted, and the new oil deal will generate economic prosperity for both the Venezuelan and American people.\"\n\nAll of Venezuela's top officials are long-time members of the PSUV. The party was created in 2007 by merging the disparate political and social forces that swept socialist President Hugo Chavez to power in 1999. That movement also came to bear his name - ‘Chavismo.’\n\nThe reasons given for falling local support varied. Some said people were wary of being associated with the party if the opposition were to win power, fearing some form of retribution. Others said uncertainty was causing infighting in ⁠the party. Nearly all spoke of disillusionment and questioned the loyalty of the new leadership to the Chavista cause.\n\nAdding to people’s hardship are problems with the delivery of party handouts, both food and ​financial, that have hit local branches, five sources said. They said members in three states - Zulia, Aragua and Falcon – were deserting the party because the government had stopped making bonus payments and distributing welfare. Reuters ​was not able to independently verify the information it gathered about stalling handouts.\n\nGovernment payments, which through various different benefits can for some add up to over $100 a month, are a vital income for millions in Venezuela, where the monthly minimum wage is less than $1 and poverty is rampant. Inflation is also estimated by analysts to have topped 400% in 2025.\n\nThe complexity of Venezuela's welfare system, with an array of benefits delivered at different times to different people, meant Reuters was unable to get a complete picture of the status of all payments and food ‍parcels, with some of those interviewed saying certain bonuses were still arriving while others were ⁠not.\n\nOne source in Zulia state said that in their district 600 people had not received their “family bonus”, a direct welfare payment of up to $65 given to help with living costs. Three sources also reported that food parcels, known as CLAP, have not been delivered, with some adding that problems with these deliveries predate the capture of Maduro but have continued since.\n\nIn the municipality of Mara, in the northwest border with Colombia, one party member said there were old-school Socialist Party members still committed to the cause and “clapping like seals” but that even they are “turning because they haven't been paid their bonuses.\"\n\nAbout 70% of local party members and ⁠public employees in Mara ignored calls to participate in two recent pro-Maduro marches, the person said, leading bosses to threaten people with firings. Reuters could not establish the size of the marches or if there were any firings as a result.\n\nFour of the people Reuters spoke to reported that even the motorbike-riding ‘colectivos’ were attending fewer events and have not been mobilized to push people into public support of the government. Their ‌members have been responsible for killing opposition figures and anti-government protesters, according to reports, which Reuters has not independently confirmed, from organizations like Human Rights Watch.\n\nThe person in Mara said many colectivo members are now working as motorbike taxi drivers, failing to show up to marches despite threats from ‌local authorities to revoke their mototaxi work permits, the person said. \"They hide, they fake an illness and a few have gone to Colombia.\"",

    "title": "NASA's Artemis II Spacesuits Still Have One Big Problem, According To Former Astronauts",
    "description": "As NASA prepares to kick off the Artemis missions, experts have noticed a potentially dangerous issue with a crucial component: the newly designed spacesuits.",
    "fullText": "You would think that NASA has everything ironed out for its biggest mission series yet: the Artemis missions, which will eventually send a crew of astronauts to the lunar surface. But as Artemis II gears up to launch and the rocket is prepared for takeoff, NASA is still adapting, though not necessarily for the better.\n\nFor example, the Artemis II Orion craft had a potentially dangerous flaw that saw NASA adjusting its reentry trajectory to address it. That flaw was originally discovered during the Artemis I mission, when the craft's heat shield saw char loss. Meanwhile, the new spacesuits pose another big problem: They will reportedly be heavier and bulkier than those worn during the Apollo missions (dubbed the Armstrong spacesuit). After over half a century, the astronauts will be wearing suits that have taken a step backwards in the heft department. It may not seem concerning since they'll be bouncing around in zero gravity, but former astronauts put that idea to bed. Being on the moon will actually create \"extreme physical stress\" on the astronauts for several reasons.\n\nKate Rubins, former astronaut and professor of computational and systems biology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, explains that during a moonwalk, physical stress is elevated. For starters, \"people are going to be sleep shifting,\" which means they'll barely rest. Moreover, the astronauts will be wearing the suits for up to nine hours and doing EVAs (extravehicular activities or spacewalks) every day. According to Rubins, the spacewalks she did outside the ISS were like doing multiple marathons in succession.\n\nAs Rubin explains, the Axiom commercial suits (aka the Axiom Extravehicular Mobility Unit, or AxEMU) will create added physical exertion and stress during the moonwalks. Not exclusively from the suits, but also equipment astronauts will be wearing and carrying, like a heavy life support backpack. The suits weigh over 300 pounds in Earth's gravity, though due to the lower gravity — about 1/6 of Earth's — they're lighter on the lunar surface. They'll still be heavier than the original 185-pound Armstrong suits. Each astronaut will also have to contend with the weight of the suit, the equipment, and their body mass collectively. Artemis III will not have a rover, either, so astronauts will be taking all physical exertion upon themselves to move equipment, tools, and other gear.\n\nThe AxEMU suits do a lot of things right, per official descriptions. They're safer and built to last generations, and they offer a custom fit for everyone. NASA and the Artemis astronauts promote the increase in mobility the Axiom suits offer. With a lot of those improvements thanks to the rear-entry design. Astronauts can get in and out themselves without help. Moreover, the suit is engineered for planetary or surface walks, which means support for legs, more upper mobility, and modular support to bring various tools.\n\nEven so, the weight may pose a challenge bigger than anyone is expecting. Former astronaut Harrison \"Jack\" Schmitt, from the Apollo 17 mission, once remarked he would have designed suits to have \"four times the mobility, and half the weight.\" The AxEMU may have more mobility, but it's also heavier. We'll know soon enough how it works out, as NASA is already building the Artemis 3 rocket, which will fly after Artemis II's loop around the moon.\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "The FBI collected ample proof that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused underage girls but found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men, an Associated P...",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — The FBI collected ample proof that Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused underage girls but found scant evidence the well-connected financier led a sex trafficking ring serving powerful men, an Associated Press review of internal Justice Department records shows.\n\nVideos and photos seized from Epstein’s homes in New York, Florida and the Virgin Islands didn’t depict victims being abused or implicate anyone else in his crimes, a prosecutor wrote in one 2025 memo.\n\nAn examination of Epstein’s financial records, including payments he made to entities linked to influential figures in academia, finance and global diplomacy, found no connection to criminal activity, said another internal memo in 2019.\n\nSummarizing the investigation in an email last July, agents said “four or five” Epstein accusers claimed other men or women had sexually abused them. But, the agents said, there “was not enough evidence to federally charge these individuals.”\n\nThe AP and other media organizations are still reviewing millions of pages of documents, many of them previously confidential, that the Justice Department released under the Epstein Files Transparency Act and it is possible those records contain evidence overlooked by investigators.\n\nHere are takeaways from what the documents show about the FBI investigation and why U.S. authorities ultimately decided to close it without additional charges.\n\nThe Epstein investigation began in 2005, when the parents of a 14-year-old girl reported that she had been molested at the millionaire’s home in Palm Beach, Florida. Then-Miami U.S. attorney Alexander Acosta struck a deal letting Epstein plead guilty to state charges of soliciting prostitution from an underage girl. Sentenced to 18 months in jail, Epstein was free by mid-2009.\n\nIn 2018, a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea deal prompted federal prosecutors to take a fresh look at the accusations.\n\nEpstein was arrested in July of 2019. One month later, he killed himself in his jail cell.\n\nA year later, prosecutors charged Epstein’s longtime confidant, Ghislaine Maxwell, saying she’d recruited several of his victims and sometimes joined the sexual abuse. Convicted in 2021, Maxwell is serving a 20-year prison term.\n\nLack of evidence for coconspirators\n\nProsecution memos, case summaries and other documents made public in the department’s latest release of Epstein-related records show that FBI agents and federal prosecutors diligently pursued potential coconspirators. Even seemingly outlandish and incomprehensible claims, called in to tip lines, were examined.\n\nSome allegations couldn’t be verified, investigators wrote.\n\nIn 2011 and again in 2019, investigators interviewed Virginia Roberts Giuffre, who in lawsuits and news interviews had accused Epstein of arranging for her to have sexual encounters with numerous men, including Britain’s former Prince Andrew.\n\nInvestigators said they confirmed that Giuffre had been sexually abused by Epstein. But other parts of her story were problematic.\n\nGiuffre acknowledged writing a partly fictionalized memoir of her time with Epstein containing descriptions of things that didn’t take place. She had also offered shifting accounts in interviews with investigators, they wrote.\n\nTwo other Epstein victims who Giuffre had claimed were also “lent out” to powerful men told investigators they had no such experience, prosecutors wrote in a 2019 internal memo.\n\nInvestigators seized a multitude of videos and photos from Epstein’s electronic devices and homes in New York, Florida and the U.S. Virgin Islands. They found CDs, hard copy photographs and at least one videotape containing nude images of females.\n\nNo videos or photos showed Epstein victims being sexually abused, none showed any males with any of the nude females, and none contained evidence implicating anyone other than Epstein and Maxwell, then-Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey wrote in an email for FBI officials last year.\n\nHad they existed, the government “would have pursued any leads they generated,” Comey wrote. “We did not, however, locate any such videos.”\n\nInvestigators who scoured Epstein’s bank records found payments to more than 25 women who appeared to be models — but no evidence that he was engaged in prostituting women to other men, prosecutors wrote.\n\nProsecutors weighed the possibility of charging some of Epstein’s close associates, including an assistant and business clients, but ultimately decided against it because of lack of evidence.\n\nAttorney General Pam Bondi told Fox News in February 2025 that Epstein’s never-before-seen “client list” was “sitting on my desk right now.” But FBI agents wrote superiors saying the client list didn't exist.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2024, about three weeks before President Joe Biden left office, then-FBI Deputy Director Paul Abbate reached out through subordinates to ask \"whether our investigation to date indicates the ‘client list,’ often referred to in the media, does or does not exist,” according to an email summarizing his query.\n\nA day later, an FBI official replied that the case agent had confirmed no client list existed.\n\nOn Feb. 19, 2025, two days before Bondi’s Fox News appearance, an FBI supervisory special agent wrote: “While media coverage of the Jeffrey Epstein case references a ‘client list,’ investigators did not locate such a list during the course of the investigation.”\n\nAaron Kessler in Washington contributed to this report.\n\n___ The AP is reviewing the documents released by the Justice Department in collaboration with journalists from CBS, NBC, MS NOW and CNBC. Journalists from each newsroom are working together to examine the files and share information about what is in them. Each outlet is responsible for its own independent news coverage of the documents.",

A little bit sloppy in the field which is disappointing.\n\n\"Experience told. The Sri Lanka team at the end of both innings, that was the difference really.\n\n\"Those 20 runs - they defended well at the back end. We had plenty of wickets in hand, thought we were in good positions the whole way through and they really upped the ante and put the squeeze on.\n\n\"You can sit back and reflect and pick those 20 runs out of anywhere. They were 20 runs better than us throughout the whole match.\"\n\nAustralia are Ireland's next opponents on Wednesday as they chase a top-two finish to secure a place in the Super 8s.\n\nSpin dominated in Sunday's encounter at the R Premadasa Stadium and Stirling believes that could continue in the tournament.\n\n\"I think spin is going to be a challenge in this competition.\n\n\"Certainly, it wasn't coming onto the bat as much as it could have been. Spin is going to be dominating phases of this game.\"",

    "description": "A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimi...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — A leading U.S. health official on Sunday urged people to get inoculated against the measles at a time of outbreaks across several states and as the United States is at risk of losing its measles elimination status.\n\n“Take the vaccine, please,” said Dr. Mehmet Oz, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services administrator whose boss has raised suspicion about the safety and importance of vaccines. “We have a solution for our problem.”\n\nOz, a heart surgeon, defended some recently revised federal vaccine recommendations as well as past comments from President Donald Trump and the nation's health chief, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., about the efficacy of vaccines. From Oz, there was a clear message on the measles.\n\n“Not all illnesses are equally dangerous and not all people are equally susceptible to those illnesses,” he told CNN’s “State of the Union.” “But measles is one you should get your vaccine.”\n\nAn outbreak in South Carolina in the hundreds has surpassed the recorded case count in Texas’ 2025 outbreak, and there is also one on the Utah-Arizona border. Multiple other states have had confirmed cases this year. The outbreaks have mostly impacted children and have come as infectious disease experts warn that rising public distrust of vaccines generally may be contributing to the spread of a disease once declared eradicated by public health officials.\n\nAsked in the television interview whether people should fear the measles, Oz replied, “Oh, for sure.” He said Medicare and Medicaid will continue to cover the measles vaccine as part of the insurance programs.\n\n“There will never be a barrier to Americans get access to the measles vaccine. And it is part of the core schedule,” Oz said.\n\nBut Oz also said “we have advocated for measles vaccines all along” and that Kennedy “has been on the very front of this.”\n\nQuestions about vaccines did not come up later in a Kennedy interview on Fox News Channel's “The Sunday Briefing,” where he was asked about what kind of Super Bowl snack he might have (probably yogurt). He also he eats steak with sauerkraut in the mornings.\n\nCritics of Kennedy have argued that the health secretary's longtime skepticism of U.S. vaccine recommendations and past sympathy for the unfounded claim that vaccines may cause autism may influence official public health guidance in ways contrary to the medical consensus.\n\nOz argued that Kennedy's stance was supportive of the measles vaccine despite Kennedy's general comments about the recommended vaccine schedule.\n\n“When the first outbreak happened in Texas, he said, get your vaccines for measles, because that’s an example of an ailment that you should get vaccinated against,” Oz said.\n\nThe Republican administration last month dropped some vaccine recommendations for children, an overhaul of the traditional vaccine schedule that the Department of Health and Human Services said was in response to a request from Trump.\n\nTrump asked the agency to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising U.S. guidance accordingly.\n\nStates, not the federal government, have the authority to require vaccinations for schoolchildren. While federal requirements often influence those state regulations, some states have begun creating their own alliances to counter the administration’s guidance on vaccines.\n\nU.S. vaccination rates have dropped and the share of children with exemptions has reached an all-time high, according to federal data. At the same time, rates of diseases that can be protected against with vaccines, such as measles and whooping cough, are rising across the country.\n\nKennedy's past anti-vaccine activism\n\nKennedy's past skepticism of vaccines has come under scrutiny since Trump first nominated him to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nDuring his Senate confirmation testimony last year, Kennedy told lawmakers that a closely scrutinized 2019 trip he took to Samoa, which came before a devastating measles outbreak, had “nothing to do with vaccines.”\n\nBut documents obtained by The Guardian and The Associated Press undermine that testimony. Emails sent by staffers at the U.S. Embassy and the United Nations said that Kennedy sought to meet with top Samoan officials during his trip to the Pacific island nation.\n\nSamoan officials later said Kennedy’s trip bolstered the credibility of anti-vaccine activists before the measles outbreak, which sickened thousands of people and killed 83, mostly children under age 5.\n\nMixed messaging on autism, vaccines\n\nOz's comments mark a broader pattern among administration officials of voicing discordant and at times contradictory statements about the efficacy of vaccines amid an overhaul of U.S. public health policy.\n\nOfficials have walked a fine line in criticizing past U.S. vaccine policy, often at times appearing to express sympathy for unfounded conspiracy theories from anti-vaccine activists, while also not straying too far from established science.\n\nDuring a Senate hearing Tuesday, Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, said no single vaccine causes autism, but he did not rule out the possibility that research may find some combination of vaccines could have negative health side effects.\n\nBut Kennedy, in Senate testimony, has argued that a link between vaccines and autism has not been disproved.\n\nHe has previously claimed that some components of vaccines, like the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, may cause childhood neurological disorders such as autism. Most vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella do not contain thimerosal. A federal vaccine advisory board overhauled by Kennedy last year voted to no longer recommend thimerosal-containing vaccines.\n\nAdministration public health officials often cite the need to restore trust in public health systems after the coronavirus pandemic, when vaccine policy and the general public health response to the deadly pandemic became a highly polarizing topic in American politics.\n\nMisinformation and conspiracy theories about the public health system also spread during the pandemic, and longtime anti-vaccine activist groups saw a swell in interest from the wider public.\n\nKennedy, who for years led the anti-vaccine activist group Children's Health Defense, has been criticized for ordering reviews of vaccines and public health guidelines that leading medical research groups have deemed settled science.\n\nPublic health experts also criticized the president for making unfounded claims about highly politicized health issues. During a September Oval Office event, Trump asserted without evidence that Tylenol and vaccines are linked to a rise in the incidence of autism in the United States.",

    "fullText": "After a week of frenzied build-up in the San Francisco Bay Area, America's biggest game takes place on Sunday night.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 is being held in Santa Clara, California, with the New England Patriots aiming for a record seventh victory.\n\nThe Seattle Seahawks are narrow favourites to lift the Lombardi Trophy, but Sunday's game is about much more than the NFL champions being decided.\n\nMany stars from sport, music and film have headed to the Bay Area for what is one of the biggest events in world sport.\n\nMillions will tune in around the world, with the past three Super Bowls having been the most-watched US television broadcasts since the 1969 Moon landing.\n\nAnd many of those viewers will be switching on just for the half-time show, with Bad Bunny set to perform a historic set, although US President Donald Trump will not be one of them.\n\nThe Puerto Rican superstar has been critical of Trump and his administration's immigration policies, although fears over potential raids this weekend have been allayed.\n\nAfter the Kansas City Chiefs reached five of the past six Super Bowls, one of the NFL's most iconic franchises is back in the big game.\n\nThe Patriots have reached their first Super Bowl since 2019 and the departure of legendary quarterback Tom Brady and coach Bill Belichick.\n\nLed by second-year quarterback Drake Maye, they will make a record-extending 12th appearance in the NFL showpiece and aim for their seventh win, which would break a tie with the Pittsburgh Steelers.\n\nThey will meet Seattle in a repeat of Super Bowl 49 in 2015, when the Patriots denied the Seahawks back-to-back championships.\n\nThis is Seattle's first Super Bowl appearance since then, and their fourth overall, with their sole championship win coming in 2014.\n\nQuarterback Sam Darnold is playing for his fifth team in eight years but has reached his first Super Bowl in his first season with Seattle, whose fearsome defence is led by British defensive coordinator Aden Durde, who has become the first overseas coach to reach America's biggest game.\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nIs the evil empire back? How the Patriots rebuilt a broken dynasty\n\nMany of the millions watching around the world will be more interested in the half-time show than the game itself.\n\nPuerto Rican pop star Bad Bunny has been chosen as this year's headliner having been a special guest when Shakira and Jennifer Lopez headlined in 2020.\n\nHe will not only be the first solo male Latin artist to perform the half-time show but also the first artist to perform their set entirely in Spanish.\n\nThe 31-year-old was Spotify's most streamed artist in four of the past six years. He is also an actor, has hosted Saturday Night Live and been a WWE 24/7 champion.\n\nRock band Green Day, who are from California, will play an anniversary ceremony before Sunday's game and the NFL has teased that there will be some surprises at half-time.\n\nBad Bunny and Green Day have been critical of President Trump, and Bad Bunny's selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles.\n\nThe controversy even led conservative group Turning Point USA to plan an alternative half-time show, which will star singer and Trump ally Kid Rock.\n\nBad Bunny says he's losing sleep over the Super Bowl\n\n'Bad Bunny half-time show will unite people'\n\nTrump became the first sitting president to attend America's biggest game last year, but he said this year's on the west coast is \"just too far away\".\n\nAsked about the selection of Bad Bunny and Green Day, Trump added:, external \"I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred.\"\n\nBad Bunny said he avoided the US on his current world tour because of concerns that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents would conduct raids on fans at his concerts.\n\nThere were fears there would be raids around the San Francisco Bay Area this weekend, plus further protests after two people were shot dead by ICE agents in Minneapolis.\n\nBut, speaking on Tuesday, the NFL's chief security officer Cathy Lanier said that no ICE operations are scheduled around any of the many Super Bowl events.\n\nShe added that the Department of Homeland Security sends a variety of different agencies to the Super Bowl, which it ranks as a tier-one event, and ICE is not one of them.\n\nWhich NFL team should you support?\n\nHow much do you know about this year's Super Bowl?\n\nAlthough Sunday's game will take place at the home of the San Francisco 49ers, Levi's Stadium is 45 miles south of the Golden Gate Bridge in Santa Clara.\n\nWhile San Francisco has been the main hub during Super Bowl week, events and parties have been spread around the Bay Area, beginning with Opening Night in San Jose on Monday.\n\nActor Jon Hamm hosted the NFL's end-of-season awards night on Thursday, which was attended by Steve Irwin's son Robert, who earlier in the day took a snake into the media centre to help promote the first NFL game in Melbourne later this year.\n\nShaquille O'Neal hosted a party on Friday while Post Malone held a free concert, with artists as diverse as Olivia Dean, Shaboozey, Sting, Calvin Harris, Zach Bryan and Teddy Swims playing at other events.\n\nCardi B also performed on Saturday before watching her partner Stefon Diggs play for the Patriots on Sunday, when Charlie Puth, Brandi Carlile and Coco Jones are also among the gameday performers.\n\nOther visitors include Roger Federer, Jay-Z, Travis Scott, Mark Wahlberg and Paris St-Germain owner Nasser Al-Khelaifi.\n\nWahlberg's fellow New England fan Jon Bon Jovi will introduce the Patriots players on Sunday, with actor Chris Pratt, a Seattle supporter, doing the honours for the Seahawks.\n\nLive text commentary from 21:30 on the BBC Sport website and app, and live radio coverage on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds.

    "description": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's behaviour towards her pupils was branded \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it was hard to see her returning - but she is back for Milan-Cortina 2026.",
    "fullText": "When figure skating coach Eteri Tutberidze's \"tremendous coldness\" was described as \"chilling to see\" at the last Winter Olympics, it may have been hard to imagine her returning to her sport's biggest stage.\n\nFour years later, the highly successful coach is at Milan-Cortina - and not everyone is happy about it.\n\nTutberidze and her training methods were under the spotlight at Beijing 2022 amid the Kamila Valieva doping scandal that rocked the Games, and it was the then-IOC president Thomas Bach who gave the stinging assessment of the coach.\n\nRather than comforting 15-year-old gold medal favourite Valieva when she left the ice in tears after falling several times, Tutberidze had instead asked the youngster \"why did you stop fighting?\"\n\nBach said he had been \"very, very disturbed\" by what he had seen and that it did not give him \"much confidence in this closest entourage of Kamila, neither with regard to what happened in the past, nor as far as it concerns the future\".\n\nWell, that future is here and so too is Tutberidze.\n\nNot only is Tutberidze back at the Olympics, but she is apparently coach to another Russian teenage medal hope.\n\nThat skater is 18-year-old Adeliia Petrosian, who is here as a neutral athlete (AIN) as Russia's team are banned from the Games because of the country's invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, Tutberidze is not officially listed as the teenager's coach in the media guide for these Games and it remains to be seen whether she will be at rinkside when Petrosian competes.\n\nWhoever she is with, there will be many eyes on Tutberidze, with the shadow of Valieva and Beijing 2022 set to loom large.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nTutberidze's official coaching role is with the Georgia figure skating team and she was at Milano Ice Skating Arena for the team event to watch one of her longest-serving pupils, Nika Egadze.\n\nEgadze stormed to victory at the 2026 European Championships in Sheffield, where Tutberidze shared a warm hug with her skater after a gold medal-winning performance, and other athletes spoke positively about the coach.\n\nIt was a different story at Milano Ice Skating Arena as Egadze endured two error-strewn routines, with Georgia missing out on a medal.\n\nIn the short programme he made two early errors, failing to land the triple toe loop in his first technical element.\n\nAs he continued his performance, the TV cameras caught Tutberidze in passing - standing at rinkside, arms folded.\n\nEgadze did enough to pull the performance around and help earn Georgia fifth place in qualifying, progressing to the final. When he came off the ice, the hug from Tutberidze seemed curt.\n\nShe joined the Georgian squad as they waited for the results. Generally, waiting teams will laugh and joke, even if they know elimination is coming.\n\nInstead, the 11 skaters and team members sat stony-faced as the scores were announced.\n\nIf this was an indicator of the atmosphere in the team, it is certainly not positive, but it may have just been a moment of nervous focus.\n\nPerhaps Tutberidze was minding her body language on Sunday as Egadze struggled even \n\nHis coach gave him a pat on the hand as the numbers came in. Despite Egadze scoring only 154.79 for the free skate - 27 points lower than his season best - there was no berating.\n\nThe attention comes at a Games which began for Georgia with their team being roundly booed in San Siro when they entered the stadium during the opening ceremony.\n\nOfficial views on Tutberidze's presence in Milan vary.\n\nGiven she has not been personally implicated in any doping scandals and has not broken any rules, Tutberidze has every right to be at the Olympics.\n\nShe has rejected any suggestions of wrongdoing in her career as a coach and said in 2022 she was baffled by Bach's remarks.\n\n\"There was an investigation at the time and no issues were found that could be actioned against that individual,\" IOC spokesman Mark Adams told a media conference on Sunday.\n\n\"If you are going to take action against someone, you need evidence, and from what I gather there isn't any.\"\n\nHowever, World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) president Witold Banka said on Thursday he does not \"feel comfortable with her presence here\",, external while Britain's 1980 Olympic champion and BBC pundit Robin Cousins was unequivocal in his disdain.\n\n\"This comes down to the International Olympic Committee and International Skating Union - coaches are not part of the team,\" Cousins told BBC Sport.\n\n\"So when they ban a team, the coach of said team is not part of that. That is not correct, as far as I am concerned. I would not have her anywhere near Milan, personally.\n\n\"Is that because of behaviour, or Russia being banned? All of the above.\n\n\"The way we watched everything unfold, someone has to take the blame. Any skater would say the most important person is the coach; you trust them, you give yourself to them. That is not how you treat a student.\"\n\nA few weeks ago, a television documentary - The Tutberidze Method - was released in Russia, celebrating her track record in training medal winners.\n\nTwo of Tutberidze's skaters have won women's gold and silver medals at the past two Olympics, but both were amid drama.\n\nAs the Valieva saga played out, Beijing 2022 champion Anna Shcherbakova was left barely celebrating victory – later saying she felt \"emptiness\" – while silver medallist Alexandra Trusova was so disappointed to miss out on gold that she said before the medal ceremony that she never wanted to skate again.\n\nFour years before that, in 2018, favourite Evgenia Medvedeva was sobbing after being upstaged by 15-year-old training partner Alina Zagitova.\n\nIn the run-up to those two Games, Tutberidze's skaters had been hot favourites, dominating the World Championships and European Championships.\n\nLittle has been seen of Petrosian recently on the international stage because of Russia's ban from competition. The only real sighting of her was at September's qualifying event in Beijing, where she won gold, but not all the top skaters were there.\n\nPetrosian has also won the past three national championships – making it 11 years in a row for Tutberidze skaters – and she is the first woman to land a quadruple loop in competition, but she was injured last year and has struggled with errors this season.\n\nFollowing the Valieva episode, the minimum age for competitors was raised from 15 to 17, an age that has not been far off retirement age for some of Tutberidze's skaters in the past because of a combination of injury and a drop in technical skills.\n\nIt has been reported that her training model centres around female skaters peaking before they hit puberty., external\n\nItalian Daniel Grassl, who went to work with Tutberidze in Moscow in 2023, described her as a \"very good\" coach, adding: \"She can be a little bit cold but she was warm with us, and was supporting us.\"\n\nValieva, a mercurial talent who performances drew worldwide attention, was eventually banned for four years over her failed drugs test, but there were no sanctions for any of her entourage.\n\nHer team have always insisted the failed test - for heart medication trimetazidine - was the result of contaminated cutlery which had been tainted by her grandfather's medication, while Wada called for those behind the failed test to face justice because \"the doping of children is unforgivable\".\n\n\"Wada is not behind the decision to accredit the coach [for Milan-Cortina],\" Banka said. \"The investigation found no evidence this person [Tutberidze] engaged in the topic, so there is no legal basis to exclude her.\"\n\nValieva, now 19, has only just returned to skating, finishing sixth in the semi-finals of the Russian Jump Championships last week. She is no longer coached by Tutberidze.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.",

    "description": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has not had many tougher weeks in her managerial career and was defiant following their win at Tottenham.",
    "fullText": "Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor has not had many tougher weeks in her managerial career.\n\nHaving fallen 12 points adrift of Women's Super League (WSL) leaders Manchester City, suffering back-to-back defeats in the process, pressure was at its highest.\n\nShe faced backlash from her own supporters, questions over her position at the club, and anything other than victory at Tottenham would have been a disaster.\n\nThe club rallied around the Frenchwoman, who led Chelsea to an unbeaten domestic treble in her debut season, by announcing she had signed a four-year contract extension 48 hours before their crucial game at Spurs.\n\nThat was the backing she needed and Bompastor could breathe a sigh of relief - and even celebrate animatedly - as her side got over the line with a 2-0 win.\n\n\"Even if we all know we can't control anything of that, we probably felt it was unfair to receive that amount of criticism,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"I know who I am, I don't need people outside my environment to tell me who I am. I will always make sure I give my best. I know I have the competence, I know I have the knowledge, I know the women's game and I do my best for Chelsea.\n\n\"I'm not saying I'm the best one, I'm not saying I'm arrogant, but I know who I am. I always make sure I support my players in the best way possible.\n\n\"My job is to make sure they go on the pitch with clarity on what they need to achieve. No-one is going to disturb me on my confidence.\"\n\nWith the WSL title seemingly out of their grasp, Chelsea's priority is to ensure they clinch a top-three spot and qualification for next season's Champions League.\n\nRivals Arsenal and Manchester United did their part earlier in the weekend - so Chelsea had to respond.\n\nTottenham, who started the game a point behind Chelsea, came out of the blocks firing and could have taken the lead when Olivia Holdt hit the crossbar.\n\nNervy Chelsea were in a battle until Keira Walsh's goal just before half-time rocked Spurs and put the Blues in the driving seat. It was the \"game-changer\" they needed.\n\n\"When you want to perform at your best, you need to have the four elements of the performance align at the highest level - the tactical, mental, physical and technical aspects,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"If one of them, or some of them, are not as high as possible, it affects the performance. We were a different team in the second half. That's who we want to be.\"\n\nBompastor's actions were deliberate on Sunday. After the warm-up, she walked out on to the pitch and high-fived every member of her squad.\n\nShe celebrated with assistant coach Meline Gerard, who lifted her up and spun her around in the dugout, when Walsh's goal put Chelsea 1-0 up - something she rarely does, but said afterwards she should do more.\n\nIn normal circumstances, a victory at Tottenham would be seen as par for the course. But this was three points which gave Chelsea a significant boost.\n\n\"I will enjoy it. I'm not going to lie, it's been a difficult time. It's been tough so we need to celebrate with players and staff,\" said Bompastor.\n\n\"We know when we are at Chelsea we need to win every game and we want, as much as possible, to be in control. To do that, we need to get points to win.\n\n\"We still have a lot to play for. We know what we can improve.\"\n\nChelsea's performance still left much to be desired but Bompastor said she was \"really proud\" of how her players dealt with the unfamiliar criticism.\n\nThe Blues have won six successive domestic titles so most in the squad have never experienced a season without silverware.\n\nThey have already booked their place in the Women's League Cup final, have a fifth-round FA Cup tie to play and are in the Champions League quarter-finals.\n\nIf they win a European crown - the one trophy that has eluded them - their WSL blip will be quickly forgotten.\n\nBut experienced midfielder Erin Cuthbert said the overall feeling was \"relief\" after the Spurs victory - and this was unknown territory for the serial winners.\n\n\"It's been a tough couple of weeks, an experience that some of us haven't been used to. Over the 10 years I've been here, we've had moments like this,\" Cuthbert told BBC Two.\n\n\"The league's getting better and we've played against two top teams who probably beat us quite convincingly. It was back to the drawing board this week.\n\n\"We didn't want to be a Chelsea team who bow down game after game. That's not what we're about, that's not what we're built upon.\n\n\"It was a difficult first 20 minutes. We got quite lucky to be honest. But you're going to need a bit of luck to get out of a hole.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "description": "\"You don't have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.\"",
    "fullText": "The US government has found a frighteningly efficient way to keep tabs on citizens who criticize the government: just demand their personal data from Google.\n\nAccording to recent reporting from the Washington Post, a 67-year-old retiree sent a polite email to an attorney for the Department of Homeland Security urging mercy for an asylum seeker facing deportation to Afghanistan. The man, identified only as Jon, had read about the Afghani native’s case, and his fear that he would be persecuted should he ever return to his home country.\n\n“Don’t play Russian roulette with [this man’s] life,” Jon told lead DHS prosecutor, Joseph Dernbach, in the email. “Err on the side of caution. There’s a reason the US government along with many other governments don’t recognise the Taliban. Apply principles of common sense and decency.”\n\nFive hours later, per WaPo, Jon received a response — not from Dernbach or the DHS, but from Google.\n\n“Google has received legal process from a Law Enforcement authority compelling the release of information related to your Google Account,” it read. The email advised Jon that the “legal process” was an administrative subpoena, issued by DHS. Soon, government agents would arrive at his home.\n\nThe subpoena wasn’t approved by any judge, and it didn’t require probable cause. Google gave Jon just seven days to challenge it in federal court — not nearly enough time for someone without a crack team of lawyers on retainer. Even more maddeningly, neither Google nor DHS had sent him a copy of the subpoena itself, leaving Jon and his attorney in the dark.\n\n“How do you challenge a subpoena you don’t have a copy of?” an attorney Jon consulted, Judi Bernstein-Baker, told WaPo.\n\nAs DHS assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin told the newspaper in a statement, the law grants the department “broad administrative subpoena authority,” meaning legal demands from DHS officials don’t need to pass independent review.\n\n“There’s no oversight ahead of time, and there’s no ramifications for having abused [administrative subpoenas] after the fact,” Jennifer Granick, an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union — which is representing Jon pro bono — told WaPo. “As we are increasingly in a world where unmasking critics is important to the administration, this type of legal process is ripe for that kind of abuse.”\n\nWhen uniformed DHS agents did show up at Jon’s front door weeks later, they grilled him for over 20 minutes, pointing to his mentions of “Russian roulette” and the “Taliban” as suspicious. In the end, the field grunts — who had been dispatched by an anonymous official in Washington DC — agreed Jon hadn’t broken any laws.\n\nWhen Jon finally received a copy of the subpoena from Google — 22 days after they issued their seven-day notice — it demanded his data going back weeks: timestamps for his online activity, every known IP and physical address, his credit card, driver’s license, and Social Security numbers.\n\n“It doesn’t take that much to make people look over their shoulder, to think twice before they speak again,” Nathan Freed Wessler, another of Jon’s ACLU attorneys, told WaPo. “That’s why these kinds of subpoenas and other actions — the visits — are so pernicious. You don’t have to lock somebody up to make them reticent to make their voice heard.”\n\n“Our processes for handling law enforcement subpoenas are designed to protect users’ privacy while meeting our legal obligations,” a Google spokesperson told WaPo. “We review all legal demands for legal validity, and we push back against those that are overbroad or improper, including objecting to some entirely.”\n\nMore on DHS: There’s Something So Embarrassing About Homeland Security’s New Drone Video That We’re Gonna Have to Sit Down for a Minute",

    "fullText": "Travel content creator Murphy Ng saw something distressing while hiking near the Maliau Basin Studies Centre in Sabah, Malaysia, The New Straits Times reported.\n\nNg was walking along the Avian Trail with a ranger last December. At first, he didn't know what he was looking at.\n\n\"We spotted several piles of elephant dung along the trail, and I noticed something metallic and shiny,\" Ng said. \"At first, I thought it was just a small candy wrapper, but when I pulled it out, it turned out to be an entire plastic bag, completely intact.\"\n\nThe Times said that Ng shared the incident on Facebook. He encouraged people to be mindful of how they dispose of plastic as well.\n\nThis wasn't the first time an animal has had plastic in its digestive system, and it likely won't be the last. Even if the elephant did swallow a candy wrapper, plastic of all sizes can be harmful.\n\nEnvironment America reported that microplastics can make fish swim more slowly and damage their genes, which they can pass down to their offspring. A pregnant sperm whale was also found with almost 50 pounds of plastic in her stomach. All kinds of plastic waste kill over 1 million marine animals every year.\n\nThe effects of plastic pollution on marine life ripple out into how people live, too.\n\nAs microplastics disrupt how oceans absorb carbon, air pollution persists and warms the planet. Rising temperatures are contributing to extreme weather events, which can cause people to lose their jobs, homes, and ways of life.\n\nReducing plastic pollution helps people and wildlife live fuller lives in healthier and safer environments.\n\nPer the Times, elephant expert Dr. Cheryl Cheah said there are no known elephant deaths in Malaysia linked to plastic consumption.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nSupporting brands that use less plastic or make plastic obsolete, such as Stasher bags, is crucial to reducing overall plastic use. But those options can be more expensive upfront and aren't accessible to everyone.\n\nEncouraging and advocating for brands to use less plastic, especially if it's a coordinated effort, can help. Even making sure your plastic makes its way into the trash instead of the grass can reduce pollution in ecosystems.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "Manchester City's win at Liverpool ended in complete chaos - but did the referee and the VAR get Dominik Szoboszlai's red card right?",
    "fullText": "Sometimes the video assistant referee (VAR) just cannot win, stuck in a hole between what feels right in the spirit of the game and what is correct in law.\n\nManchester City thought they had scored a third goal at Liverpool which would have capped off one of the most dramatic ends to a Premier League game this season.\n\nBut it was stripped away by a VAR review for a foul committed just before the ball rolled over the line.\n\nFans will hate it, pundits won't like it, and football will turn its nose up too. Yet there really was no way the VAR, John Brooks, could not intervene.\n\nA foul was committed that facilitated a goal being scored which might have otherwise been prevented. It is really as simple as that.\n\nIt was a unique set of circumstances right at the end of a dramatic game which gave City a 2-1 win at Anfield.\n\nHere's what happened and why...\n\nMan City fight back for dramatic late win at Liverpool\n\nWith Alisson marooned upfield for a set-piece as Liverpool searched for a late equaliser, Rayan Cherki kicked the ball towards an empty net from just inside his own half.\n\nHaaland gave chase and was clearly going to outpace Dominik Szoboszlai.\n\nThe City striker had overtaken Szoboszlai 25 yards from goal and looked certain to win the race - but he was pulled back.\n\nIt was a clear foul which referee Craig Pawson identified, but he played an advantage.\n\nAs the ball rolled towards the goal with the same two players still jostling to reach it, Liverpool's Hungary international was about to slide in and clear it off the line.\n\nBefore Szoboszlai could do so, however, Haaland pulled him back, and that stopped the home player from keeping the ball out of the net.\n\nThe first pull on the Norway striker muddies the waters. After all, it seemed Haaland was definitely going to score.\n\nBut they are two distinct situations. You have to separate the first foul by Szoboszlai and the subsequent offence from Haaland.\n\nWould Szoboszlai have prevented the goal had he not been fouled? There is a high chance.\n\nOn that basis it is impossible for the goal to stand.\n\nRemember that Pawson played advantage. Had Szoboszlai been allowed to successfully keep the ball out, the play would have been brought back and he would have been sent off.\n\nThe end result would be the same as the outcome of the VAR intervention: no goal and Szoboszlai sent off for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity.\n\nIf you take out the first pull on Haaland, it is hard to see how anyone could have a problem with the goal being disallowed.\n\nThis is not the first time, or the last, that the VAR has correctly disallowed a goal and people really struggle to stomach it.\n\nYes, the goal could be important for Manchester City at the end of the season. But the goal conceded could also turn out to be vital for Liverpool.\n\nWhile the video assistant referee's intervention was ultimately correct, leading to Pawson to announce the decision to both teams and the fans, it certainly split the crowd.\n\nFormer Manchester United defender Gary Neville, who was covering the game for Sky Sports, said it \"feels so unjust\".\n\nHe added: \"I know there's rules but there is the smell of the game. Talk about killjoy. Just let the goal be.\n\n\"You have just killed one of the great moments of the season.\n\n\"You live to watch games like this. I am a fan of VAR, but it has just killed the joy.\n\n\"The reason fans watch football matches is for entertainment and for moments like that.\"\n\nBut ex-Manchester United captain Roy Keane said, if anything, the moment \"just added to the drama\" and described it as \"great\".\n\nManchester City forward Haaland said he actually felt sorry for his ex-RB Salzburg team-mate Szoboszlai.\n\n\"The referee has to follow the rules,\" Haaland told Sky Sports. \"I feel bad for him. Just give the goal and not the red card, simple as that.\n\n\"But that's the rules and that's how it is.\"\n\nCity boss Pep Guardiola simply told BBC Match of the Day: \"Come on referee, give the goal and go home.\"\n\nFollow your club with BBC Sport\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nGianluigi Donnarumma (Manchester City): Huge save at 2-1 to keep Manchester City ahead in their win at Liverpool. This is why they bought him in - he's the guy to make big saves. He commanded his area really, really well. He wasn't able to keep a clean sheet but that was because arguably the goal of the season got put past him. He was fantastic.\n\nJayden Bogle (Leeds): Excellent going forward, he has played a number of positions this season for the team but I thought he was excellent in the 3-1 win over Nottingham Forest. He was a real outlet down that right side which is obviously huge for them and a massive three points for being safe and staying up.\n\nMarc Guehi (Manchester City) and Axel Disasi (West Ham): Both of them have had an instant impact when they've come into the team. Disasi has to defend a bit deeper at West Ham - big, organised, putting his body on the line. He gives them a physical presence they've missed.\n\nMarc was a little lucky with the Mohamed Salah pullback - to still be on the pitch. But his leadership experience for Abdukodir Khusanov was exceptional. The level of confidence he gives this Manchester City backline is huge. Him hitting the ground running was exceptional for them.\n\nEl Hadji Malick Diouf (West Ham): Wonderful cross for the goal in the win at Burnley. He's been sensational since he came back from the Africa Cup of Nations. He's really added pace, power and a little bit of bite they have been missing down that side. He didn't have a great start to the season but we're starting to see the full potential of him now.\n\nVitaly Janelt (Brentford): He obviously gets a goal - wonderful header - but I actually thought he was just the best player on the pitch in the 3-2 win at Newcastle. I agree with Jordan Henderson in the sense he should have had the man of the match but he played well, kept it simple, broke up the game, broke forward when he needed to. A real solid midfielder's performance.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): What a difference a manager makes - being able to be free, get on the ball, go wherever he wants and be creative. I think Michael Carrick takes a lot of credit for that but again, another goal for him against Spurs, another win for United - he has to go in.\n\nRayan (Bournemouth): He was fantastic in the draw with Aston Villa. We have to look at Lucas Digne defensively but everything he did, running forward with pace, power, direct. He caused problems throughout the day. He's a big strong boy that gets his team up the pitch and he gets at the opposition - and Digne had no answers for him.\n\nDominik Szoboszlai (Liverpool): We're going to put him in the 10 even though he played right-back, but when you score a goal like that you're in. Unbelievable free-kick against Manchester City with pure technique to slice across the ball to make it swing from left to right and leave Donnarumma stranded.\n\nCole Palmer (Chelsea): His first start back under Liam Rosenior, talking about getting his fitness back up. He loses a few points because he was against a very bad Wolves team. However fantastic, a hat-trick, goals, penalties, confidence. The most important thing is he's smiling again - that's great for Chelsea and great for England so he deserves that, as does Rosenior for giving him that.\n\nViktor Gyokeres (Arsenal): I don't normally give subs the opportunity to start but Gyokeres to be fair came on at 60 minutes against Sunderland and scored two goals to get Arsenal over the line. Strong from him. Maybe having Jesus and Havertz around is going to bring out the best from him from a competitive point of view. But it's a fantastic day for him and a fantastic day for Arsenal.\n\nPep Guardiola (Manchester City): Huge, huge result for him at Anfield. His changes influence the game, and I think with Arsenal winning it's do or die and City put in a solid performance. Still wobbly, still a few question marks but they got the result which is all that matters.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your Team of the Week?

    "fullText": "A generation of Manchester City supporters had not experienced a winning feeling at Anfield - but all that changed on a highly dramatic Sunday evening.\n\nTrailing 1-0 to Liverpool in the 84th minute, it was turning into a theme familiar for the Citizens faithful until captain Bernardo Silva and the ice-cool Erling Haaland both netted in the dying stages to hand Pep Guardiola's side a memorable victory.\n\nCity supporters were riotous when Rayan Cherki rolled in a third into an empty net from just inside his own half, but the goal was eventually ruled out by the video assistant referee (VAR).\n\nIt mattered little as they stayed well after the final whistle to celebrate their side's triumph - only a third in the league since 1981.\n\nIt was also result that keeps City in the title race. Just.\n\nBoss Pep Guardiola joked afterwards about their last victory at Anfield five years ago, which came behind closed doors during Covid restrictions, saying: \"That doesn't count, right?\"\n\nBut this brilliant turnaround meant City are only six points adrift of leaders Arsenal with 13 games left to play - including a Gunners visit to Etihad Stadium in April - having been staring at a nine-point deficit in the closing stages.\n\n\"It is so difficult, Anfield is Anfield - the tradition, the history and the crowd,\" added Guardiola. \"It always looks smaller, tighter here and the pitch doesn't look like Etihad Stadium - and the players that they have, and everything.\n\n\"Of course we would be disappointed and all the questions would be over and over [about the title race] but six points is better than nine. It is still a lot considering how strong Arsenal are in all departments.\n\n\"The last 10 games, from my experience, it is so difficult. The important thing is to try to be there and improve because the second half was not good enough again.\n\n\"All we can do is breathe down the neck of Arsenal and being there, try if they go slip [up] and use it.\"\n\n'Killjoy' - did VAR get late drama in Liverpool v Man City right?\n\nPremier League: Man City fight back to beat Liverpool as Szoboszlai sent off in dramatic finish\n\nThe City substitutes piling over to their fans after Cherki's goal showed how much the victory meant to them - one supporter even got carried away and jumped on to the pitch before being led away by stewards.\n\nIt was an incredible conclusion to an engrossing encounter, one that has repeatedly delivered drama in Guardiola's past tussles with Jurgen Klopp and now Arne Slot.\n\nThese two sides have been the only teams to lift the Premier League trophy over the past eight years and, while reigning champions Liverpool have fallen away this term and sit in sixth place, City are clinging on.\n\n\"What can this do to Manchester City confidence-wise, going forward?\" said former England goalkeeper Paul Robinson on BBC Radio 5 Live. \"It's all about putting runs together at this stage and that is a massive result that can give them a huge confidence boost.\n\n\"They might well just - and I mean just - be in this.\"\n\nAfter their 3-0 win at Etihad Stadium earlier in the season, City achieved a league double over Liverpool for the first time since the 1936-37 campaign.\n\n\"It's an important one for City today,\" former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney told BBC Sport. \"It's a tough place to go, Anfield.\n\n\"I thought Liverpool were really good in the second half, City were really good first half - then City have gone a goal down and dug in to get the three points.\"\n\nFormer United defender Gary Neville added: \"Will this give them the bit between the teeth? Will this give them the confidence to go and chase down Arsenal?\n\nCity captain Silva started the game after recovering from a recent hamstring issue and was the catalyst for his side's comeback by prodding in the equaliser from a Haaland knockdown.\n\nThe Portuguese has now played more game against Liverpool (16) than any other City player, while his three goals at Anfield makes him City's joint-top scorer at the stadium alongside Nicolas Anelka and Ilkay Gundogan.\n\nHaaland, by contrast, scored a first goal at Anfield with his winning penalty in the third minute of added time.\n\n\"I feel the whole team knew before the game if we lost it then the title race was probably over,\" said Silva. \"We felt like we needed to win.\n\n\"The hope is there and we are going to fight until the end. We need to keep doing our job that we haven't lately.\"\n\nOn Sunday, no player ran more than Silva's 12.84km, while no City player made more passes in the final third than his 24, nor did they attempt more dribbles than his four.\n\nEarlier this season, Guardiola said he has a \"weakness\" for the 31-year-old and a player he \"loves\" very much.\n\nSilva is out of contract in the summer and the City boss added: \"He is one of the best players I have every trained with.\n\n\"He is the perfect captain. It is a joy for me as a manager to have him. The team comes first.\n\n\"His contribution is massive and he is one of the legends of this club.\"",

    "fullText": "A Caldwell company agreed to change its advertising after Idaho Attorney General Raúl Labrador’s office accused the business of misleading customers.\n\nLabrador’s office sued Right Now Heating, Cooling & Plumbing, alleging it was running deceptive direct-mail advertisements that claimed customers could obtain a furnace or air conditioning unit for a discounted price. Right Now denied the allegations.\n\n“You can get rid of your old furnace and replace with a brand new, top of the line furnace for $1,200,” one of the advertisements said.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office alleges that the claim and others made by the company were not true.\n\nThe lawsuit said that to get a new furnace, the customer would have to pay the installation cost for the furnace and a new air conditioning unit, and Right Now’s ad “does not disclose clearly and conspicuously the cost of the furnace or provide the complete cost to purchase and install both units.”\n\nLabrador’s office said customers have complained that the company failed to provide them with an itemized contract identifying the equipment and services they agreed to buy, and that they were provided a document titled “estimate” that the company contended was a sales contract.\n\nLabrador’s office said the company’s “estimate” had a tendency to mislead or confuse reasonable customers. It accused Right Now of a pattern of unfair competition and deceptive acts that violate the Idaho Consumer Protection Act and the Idaho Rules of Consumer Protection.\n\nThe Attorney General’s Office and Right Now agreed to an assurance of voluntary compliance in which the company agreed to change its advertising to clearly disclose the total cost it charges customers to purchase and install its HVAC products. For instance, if the company advertises that a customer can purchase an air conditioner for $1,475 installed, it must sell the air conditioner for that price.\n\nThe agreement, in which Right Now does not admit liability, requires the company to keep all records related to customer complaints it receives for two years after the date it takes effect.\n\n“Right Now’s stipulations to the terms of this assurance do not constitute admissions by it to any facts or violations of any state or federal law, rule or regulation,” the agreement says. “Right Now enters into this assurance for the purpose of resolving the Attorney General’s concerns ... “\n\nThe company agreed to pay the Attorney General’s office $6,500 for fees and costs it incurred in pursing the lawsuit.\n\nCanyon County District Judge Randall Grove approved the agreement on Dec. 22.\n\nIdaho’s ban on buying candy or soda with food stamps is imminent.

    "title": "Green Day Just Called Out Trump After the President Refused to Attend the Super Bowl & Called Them a ‘Terrible Choice’",
    "description": "Likely thing for them to do!",
    "fullText": "Green Day has never been part of the MAGA agenda. The California rock band has called out Donald Trump and his administration in many of their music performances, and it doesn’t look like they’re stopping any time soon.\n\nIn recent years, the band—consisting of members Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tré Cool—has replaced the lyrics of their iconic hit “American Idiot.” The song, written in 2004, initially included the lyrics “I’m not a part of a redneck agenda.” Now, when performing the song live, Armstrong sings, “I’m not part of the MAGA agenda.” The song itself, and the titular album it was written for, was a direct criticism of George W. Bush’s administration and the Iraq war.\n\nTrump Finally Addresses Savannah Guthrie's Mom's Abduction Years After She Called His Behavior 'Crazy' at Town Hall\n\nWhite House Officially Addresses Trump & Vance Feud Rumors After Reports the President Is Prepared to 'Strike' Against the VP's 'Betrayal'\n\nArmstrong also takes a jab at Vice President JD Vance through revised lyrics of “Jesus of Suburbia.” So what’s the beef between the president and the band?\n\nAfter Donald Trump was elected into office in November 2016, the band led a chant  “No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA” during an appearance at the American Music Awards.\n\nDuring the first days of the first Trump administration, Billie Joe Armstrong wrote on Instagram about his immigration executive orders that targeted countries with large Muslim populations: “I feel like I’m in a state of shock. The executive orders Trump is signing feels like a vendetta.. Trump is not only taking out his revenge on the people who protested him, but also the average American that just didn’t vote for him.”\n\nHe continued, “These reckless decisions on healthcare, muslim-americans, immigration, environmental protection, freedom of speech, freedom of press, women’s right to choose what to do with their bodies, suggesting sending in the feds to Chicago .. are signs of a man that is trying to redefine what it is that keeps our common union as Americans. This is not just his ‘conservative agenda.’ It’s an all out assault on our civil liberties. His intention is to divide us as Americans. Maybe we don’t agree on all of these issues.. But can’t we see eye to eye on some?”\n\nIn an interview with NME, Armstrong said that Trump supporters were mostly “uneducated white working-class people.” Armstrong added: “That’s the problem right there. There’s this white nationalism that’s been brewing under the radar for a long time. But now [Trump’s] been able to cause people to lash out and blame minorities and it’s really confusing. I mean, blatant misogyny going on at the same time.”\n\n“I’ve got family members from Oklahoma that are big Trump supporters. And there’s no clear answer on why they’re supporting him because he doesn’t even have any policies,” he continued. “How can you have an opinion about who you want for the Leader of the Free World when the guy running doesn’t have answers to any questions?”\n\nWhen the band performed in Washington D.C., Armstrong emphasized that the sentiments didn’t feel as intense or different as other concerts. “Outside of “f—k you,” not a real lot, honestly,” the lead singer told Rolling Stone. “People know how I feel. I feel like going negative is just throwing fuel on the fire. I feel like the government is trying to create a culture war between us in a lot of ways. They’re trying to get between your average citizens based on red and blue. I think we’re in a crisis mode right now. For me, it’s important to get back to fundamentally what it feels like to be an American. We all come from different backgrounds, but we come together and create this world. It’s like a microcosm for the rest of the world. I want people to feel unity when they come to a show. At the same time, I’m not going to puss out on saying what I feel about him and his administration.”\n\nWhen asked about their obligations in the Trump administration, Cool said, “I think we have an obligation to put on a fun show and put on a concert that’s memorable, that’s energetic and that spreads joy and open-mindedness. If being open-minded and joyful is against your political beliefs, then you know, fuck you.”\n\nIn June 2025, Armstrong shared his feelings about the president. “Donald Trump in his administration is a fascist government,” Armstrong told the crowd at Download Festival in Donington Park in the U.K. . “And it’s up to us to fight back.”\n\nGreen Day was announced as a performer in the opening ceremonies for Super Bowl LX at Levi’s Stadium, Santa Clara, Calif., a couple of miles away from the band’s roots. When asked about whether he’ll attend the football game, Trump told reporters that he would not and then criticized the performers, which also included halftime performer Bad Bunny. “I’m anti-them. I think it’s a terrible choice. All it does is sow hatred. Terrible,” Trump said.\n\nIn their first performance of 2026, the band made their stance loud and clear with the iconic “American Idiot” line. During the performance of “Holiday” and “Know Your Enemy,” Armstrong said, “This song is anti-fascism. This song is anti-war. We stand up for our brothers and sisters in Minnesota. … Ladies and gentlemen, Stephen Miller now has the floor,” referring to the ICE raids in Minneapolis that resulted in the deaths of Alex Pretto and Renee Good, while the latter line is a direct reference to homeland security advisor Stephen Miller.\n\nArmstrong also added the same sentiments when the band performed at a Super Bowl pre-show hosted by Spotify and Fanduel on Friday, Feb. 6. “This goes out to all the ICE agents out there. Wherever you are: quit your shitty-ass job. Quit that shitty job you have.” He added, “come on this side of the line.”\n\n“Because when this is over — and it will be over at some point in time — Kristi Noem, Stephen Miller, J.D. Vance, Donald Trump, they’re going to drop you like a bad f—king habit.”\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",
