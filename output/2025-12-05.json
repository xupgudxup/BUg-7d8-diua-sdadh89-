    "description": "Employers and health systems can do a better job of serving the specific healthcare needs of Millennials and Gen Zers by embracing the following seven approaches: 1) Enlist AI in the design of benefits and the delivery of care; 2) Harness virtual technologies to boost employees’ engagement in choosing and making the most of their healthcare benefits; 3) Shift to prepayment reimbursement models, which emphasize maintaining patients’ health rather than generating revenue when patients become ill; 4) Train physicians to connect with younger patients both technologically and culturally; 5) Combat the physician shortage by supporting educational programs and advocating for legislation to increase residency slots; 6) Treat mental health as an essential part of overall health; and 7) Adopting ways to make care for younger workers more affordable.",

    "description": "A/B testing, once heralded as the gold standard for data-driven decision-making, often slows companies down due to an overemphasis on statistical significance. Traditional approaches require waiting for weeks, leading to missed opportunities, and delayed growth. This caution, while appropriate for fields like drug development, is misaligned with business needs, where the real cost is often the opportunity lost rather than the risk of a small mistake. A new framework prioritizes minimizing worst-case expected loss in business terms such as dollars or conversions, rather than abstract probabilities. It enables faster, more strategic decisions by recommending action whenever the estimated impact is positive and the deployment cost is justified.",

Samus Aran picks up a few new tricks in this sequel, including her new bike, the Vi-O-La. But if you want to hear some optional ambient music while Samus cruises the deserts of planet Viewros, it's going to cost you $30 or the price of a Samus Aran Amiibo.\nPlayers have discovered that plugging in the Samus Amiibo enables Vi-O-La Radio, which enables players to choose the music that accompanies Samus's extended journey across the Sol Valley desert on the Vi-O-La. There is already some ambient music and noise to go with those scenes, this just allows players to choose music tracks from other areas to listen to.",

    "description": "You'd be forgiven for losing track of how many survival games have come out in the last decade or so, and though I personally enjoy many of them myself, it's exciting to see a new one come along and dramatically overhaul what a survival game looks like, mechanically speaking. In a crowded genre, Hello Sunshine stands out. Yes, it's a survival game with many of the mechanics you'd expect, but it doesn't look quite like any others, thanks to its one (literally) huge twist.\nThat twist is the gigantic robot companion you have by your side. The building-sized automaton walks almost ceaselessly toward a destination, and it's your mission to use its shadow to stay safe from the scorching sun, while strategically dashing into landmarks to quickly loot supplies, all while you dodge other, smaller bots along the way.",
