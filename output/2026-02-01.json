    "fullText": "Dillon Brooks has taken direct aim at Draymond Green, firing back at the Warriors veteran’s media presence while questioning where his priorities lie as an active player.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns wing did not mince his words when discussing Green’s growing role in the podcast space, turning a long-running on-court rivalry into a broader critique.\n\nBrooks’ comments immediately reignited the debate around players balancing media ventures with performance.\n\nBrooks addressed the issue in comments during N3on’s stream, shared on X by Fullcourt Pass, where he was asked about players producing podcasts during their playing careers.\n\n“I be getting on dudes that want to do the podcast grind while they’re still playing… He [Green] talks too much for me. I’m saying they’re not good at basketball, so focus on hoops,” Brooks said.\n\nThe remark was a clear shot at Green, whose podcast has become one of the most visible player-led platforms in the NBA.\n\nRather than focusing on specific games or moments, Brooks framed his criticism around commitment and performance.\n\nThe tension between Brooks and Green stretches back several seasons.\n\nIt became most visible during the 2022 NBA playoffs, when Brooks’ Memphis Grizzlies faced Green’s Golden State Warriors in a heated second-round series.\n\nThat matchup featured repeated verbal exchanges, physical play, and Brooks’ now-infamous “poke the bear” comments directed at the defending champions.\n\nGreen, a key part of four Warriors championship teams, responded at the time by questioning Brooks’ impact and playoff credentials.\n\nSince then, the two have traded indirect jabs through interviews and media appearances, even after Brooks moved on from Memphis.\n\nBrooks’ latest comments suggest that while the teams have changed, the personal edge has not. For both players, the back-and-forth has become part of a public rivalry that now extends beyond the court.\n\nHow a kid reminded Jordan Poole of getting punched by Draymond Green\n\nWhat is Jonathan Kuminga doing ‘too much’ amid trade interest from LA Lakers, reveals Draymond Green\n\n10 NBA players with most swearing fines, Draymond Green is only 8th",

    "fullText": "The summer transfer window is still a few months away, but FC Barcelona are already laying out a roadmap to strengthen the squad for the next season.\n\nAs has already been reported, signing a new centre-back and a centre-forward are set to be priorities for the Blaugrana heading into the summer.\n\nHowever, a lot will depend on the financial situation as they await their return to the 1:1 Fair Play rule, which would make things much easier in the market.\n\nNow, according to an exclusive report from The Touchline, Barcelona’s plan for the summer transfer window is to sign one ‘top’ player for a fee in the summer, while targeting one to three free agents as part of a financially controlled strategy.\n\nGiven the economic constraints, the Blaugrana are unlikely to have a lot of funds to go after multiple big signings in the summer.\n\nAs such, Deco & co. are taking a measured approach wherein the plan is to go after one top-level signing – which could potentially be in the No. 9 position to replace Robert Lewandowski.\n\nMeanwhile, Barça will also dip their toes into the free-agent pool for reinforcements – a strategy that has worked quite well for them in recent years with limited finances.\n\nIn fact, an additional report from The Touchline insists that free-transfer signings will be given major priority by the reigning La Liga champions come summer.\n\nBack on the agenda. (Photo by Lewis Storey/Getty Images)\n\nTo that end, Barcelona have already identified several potential targets who will be out of contract at the end of the ongoing season.\n\nThis includes Liverpool defender Ibrahima Konate, a player who had been heavily linked with Real Madrid not so long ago. Another Premier League defender, Marcos Senesi of AFC Bournemouth, is also on the radar.\n\nMeanwhile, Manchester City captain Bernardo Silva, a long-time target of the Blaugrana, especially during the Xavi Hernandez era, is also back on the agenda.\n\nFinally, the Catalan giants are also keeping tabs on the situation of Bayern Munich midfielder Leon Goretzka, a player Hansi Flick knows very well from their time together in Germany.\n\nIt will be interesting to see whether Barcelona sign one or more from this list of players. But for now, the plan appears to be to make one ‘top’ signing and strengthen the squad with free agents.",

We created chances. I congratulated the lads on the three points and on their overall performance,” he said.\n\n“It was important to win here. We had many chances; we need to score more, but we are creating chances. We deserved to win, and this is the style of play we want. It’s 90 minutes, and it’s easier when you score more goals.

    "title": "Shaikin: In these times, Jackie Robinson's team should not grace the White House",
    "description": "Jackie Robinson was a passionate advocate for social and racial equality, and the Dodgers going to the White House again would be incompatible with his legacy.",
    "fullText": "In 1970, two years before he died, Jackie Robinson spoke at his son’s high school graduation.\n\n“In a land where we declare that we have liberty and justice for all,” Robinson said, “it seems that slogan really means liberty and justice for all as long as you do and say what some people want you to do and say.”\n\nThose words ring uncomfortably true today.\n\nRobinson often spoke out on civil rights, challenging both political parties. If you visit the Jackie Robinson Museum, as the Dodgers did when the museum opened in 2022, you see displays on civil rights and economic opportunity and social justice before you get to the baseball showcases.\n\n“Jackie’s passion was civil rights and equality, and more so than baseball,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said then. “It was more of, baseball was just a vehicle for him to use his voice, which is pretty cool to see and actually pretty inspiring.”\n\nIn these perilous times, in which “indivisible” has been replaced by “you’re with us, or you’re the enemy within,” Robinson’s team will have the opportunity to celebrate its latest World Series championship at the White House.\n\nLast month in Minneapolis, two American citizens were shot to death on American streets by agents of the American government. In this fragile moment, I asked Roberts if he would feel comfortable visiting the White House as the manager of Jackie Robinson’s team.\n\n“For me, I stand by: I’m a baseball manager,” Roberts told me Saturday at the Dodgers’ fan festival. “That’s my job.\n\n“I was raised — by a man who served our country for 30 years — to respect the highest office in our country. For me, it doesn’t matter who is in the office, I’m going to go to the White House. I’ve never tried to be political. ... For me, I am going to continue to try to do what tradition says and not try to make political statements, because I am not a politician.”\n\nNeither was Robinson. In 1944 — three years before he broke baseball’s color barrier and 11 years before Rosa Parks — Robinson refused an order to move to the back of a bus. He was an Army lieutenant, prosecuted by a military court for insubordination and then acquitted.\n\nIn the wake of the killings of Renee Good and then Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, federal officials hurried to television cameras and social media accounts. None of the usual admonitions against leveraging tragedy for political purposes. No thoughts and prayers, even, just a rush to dehumanize the dead with labels such as “domestic terrorist” before any investigation.\n\nThe last words of Good, to one of those federal agents: “I’m not mad at you.” The last words of Pretti, to someone needing assistance: “Are you OK?”\n\nJackie Robinson: “The right of every American to first-class citizenship is the most important issue of our time.”\n\nAfter the killing of Pretti last week, the BBC exhaustively checked the claims of federal authorities against video evidence from a variety of sources: “None of the videos we have analyzed show Alex Pretti holding a gun. There is no available evidence that he was an assassin who tried to murder federal agents, no available evidence he intended to massacre law enforcement, nor that it was a violent riot, no available evidence that this was an individual who arrived at the scene to inflict maximum damage on individuals and to kill law enforcement.”\n\nIn Minnesota, the immigration sweeps proceed unabated. The Star Tribune reported Saturday of a local detention facility so overcrowded that a woman had been locked inside a bathroom with three men.\n\nIn a suburban Minneapolis incident captured on video, an agent tells a man he must produce citizenship documentation “because of your accent.”\n\nThe Huffington Post reported that four children from an elementary school in a heavily Latino suburb of Minneapolis had been shipped to a detention facility in Texas.\n\nThis is what America voted for. The “Mass Deportation Now!” placards at campaign rallies in 2024 were held high.\n\nYet a judge ordered one of those children released Saturday, blasting what he called the “ill-conceived and incompetently implemented government pursuit of daily deportation quotas, apparently even if it requires traumatizing children.”\n\nJackie Robinson: “The most luxurious possession, the richest treasure anybody has, is his personal dignity.”\n\nThis is not something the Dodgers can dismiss as an out-of-town issue. Federal immigration agents operate in Los Angeles too.\n\nAnd, since Dodger Stadium has become a must-see Japanese tourist attraction in the Shohei Ohtani era, how much might tourism drop if Japanese citizens could be forbidden from entering the United States without sharing their social media history from the preceding five years and every personal and business email address from the preceding 10 years, as federal officials have proposed?\n\nJackie Robinson: “To build for leadership, one must base his standing on what is right, not what is expedient.”\n\nI asked Dodgers president Stan Kasten whether the team had decided to visit the White House.\n\n“I don’t have any news for you on that,” he said Saturday.\n\nTo skip the trip could be uncomfortable, but the Dodgers would not have to stand on a Washington street in protest, or issue a blistering statement. All they would need to do is decline a photo opportunity.\n\nThe Dodgers are free to make their own decision, of course. They’ll be in Washington for their first road series of the season, in the first week of April. Then they’ll return to Dodger Stadium, for the annual Jackie Robinson Day festivities.\n\nFor me, going to the White House would feel more expedient than right. If the Dodgers do go, they ought to skip the tributes to Robinson’s grand courage, since they would not have been able to muster up a fraction of their own.\n\n Delivered at the start of each series.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "Detroit Tigers starting pitcher Tarik Skubal is the best pitcher in baseball and is currently pushing for one of the largest arbitration salaries in MLB history. He has also been the subject of MLB trade rumors, but Detroit’s demands could prevent a deal from happening.\n\nAppearing in a Bleacher Report live stream, MLB insider Jon Heyman of the New York Post said that while the Tigers haven’t exactly named a clear price for Skubal that they’ve set their demands high enough that it pushed two teams out of the hunt.\n\n“It is high…My impression from the Yankees and the Mets is that it was too high for them…Detroit isn’t exactly naming the exact prices, so it’s not really a two-way discussion at this points. Teams are making offers and I don’t think they are coming close at this point.”\n\nJon Heyman on the Detroit Tigers asking price for a Tarik Skubal trade\n\nHeyman noted that while the Yankees are interested in adding another starting pitcher, there is zero interest in meeting the demands set by Detroit. New York is adamant about not including starting pitcher Cam Schlittler, top prospect George Lombard Jr., and potentially even more for the two-time AL Cy Young Award winner.\n\nAs for the Mets, they already made their aggressive move to fortify the starting rotation with the trade for All-Star pitcher Freddy Peralta. New York also acquired Tobias Myers in the deal, and after dealing several of its top prospects, the club does not want to give up even more for a one-season rental of Skubal.\n\nThe Tigers’ extremely high asking price for Skubal certainly isn’t surprising. He has recorded the lowest ERA in the American League in each of the past two seasons and sports a 2.39 ERA with a 0.90 WHIP and a 38–13 record across 467.2 innings over the last three seasons. He is without question the best starter in baseball.\n\nEntering a contract year, however, teams simply are not willing to gut their farm systems and move several of their top prospects for an ace who will test the open market next winter. Realistically, Skubal will be Detroit’s Opening Day starter, and a trade is likelier to happen before the MLB trade deadline on August 3.\n\nReport: BOS Red Sox Already Want to Move on From Key Player in Rafael Devers Trade\n\nMLB Rumors: NY Yankees Interested in Adding NL MVP Before Opening Day\n\nMLB News: Los Angeles Dodgers’ All-Star Could Miss Start of 2026 Season",

    "description": "Szoboszlai has expressed his desire to pen a contract extension at Anfield but admits there has been ‘no progression’ in talks",
    "fullText": "Dominik Szoboszlai has said he would love to commit his long-term future to Liverpool by signing a new contract.\n\nThe midfielder has revealed he is in talks with the club although he said there has been no progress and he believes the issue is out of his hands.\n\nSzoboszlai’s current contract expires in 2028 but Liverpool have already started to discuss an extension with the 25 year old, who joined from RB Leipzig in 2023 for £60m.\n\nAnd the Hungary captain is keen to sign. “I would love to,” he said. “I like the city, I like the club, I like playing with these guys, I love Anfield, I love the fans, let’s see what the future holds. Let’s see what happens, hopefully everyone will be happy at the end.”\n\nHowever, Liverpool are no nearer to agreeing a deal with Szoboszlai adding: “It’s not in my hands. There is no progression but if the right offer comes then let’s see.”\n\nSzoboszlai is the frontrunner to win Liverpool’s player-of-the-year award after scoring eight goals, making seven assists and appearing in a variety of positions, but he is keen to improve again.\n\nHe added: “I am the type of guy who it is never enough for me, I can always be better and better, so there is no limit up there. I would like to get as many goals as I can, as many assists and win as many trophies as possible. That's my plan. That's how I grew up and that's how I want to keep going.”\n\nSzoboszlai filled in at right-back in Saturday’s 4-1 win over Newcastle, with both Conor Bradley and Jeremie Frimpong injured, but he stressed that he does not believe it is his best position.\n\n“Not long-term, not even medium-term in my head,” he explained. “As I've said before I'm a midfielder and hopefully our right-back is going to come back from injury and I can get back in the middle. But if the team needs me or the coach needs me there I will play and try to give my best but now Wata [Endo] is ready to play, also Curtis [Jones] is ready to play there, so we have quite a few options now.”",

    "fullText": "NBA All-Star Game format, explained: What to know about 2026 USA vs. World rules, draft, rosters and more originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe NBA All-Star game is changing once again.\n\nThe league has tinkered with different formats throughout the past few years, trying to inject excitement into a game that has lost its luster. Their latest change is the most dramatic. This year's game will feature a theme of America versus the World. The hope is that it adding an element of national pride will lead to more competitive play.\n\nNOH: My projected All-Star reserves for 2026\n\nThis year's game will feature a round robin tournament between two American teams and one World team. Each team will consist of at least eight players. Participants from both the Eastern and Western conference will be mixed among all three teams.\n\nIn the event that the 24 All-Stars are not divided evenly between 16 Americans and eight international players, commissioner Adam Silver will select players to the game until each team can field at least eight players. That may result in some teams that have more players than others.\n\nThere will be four games in total played, with each game lasting 12 minutes. In the round-robin tournament, Team A will play Team B in Game 1.  The winning team from Game 1 will take on Team C in Game 2, followed by the losing team of Game 1 meeting Team C in Game 3.\n\nAfter Game 3, the top two teams by record will advance to face each other in the championship game (Game 4).  If all three teams have a 1-1 record after Game 3, the tiebreaker would be point differential in each team’s two round-robin games.\n\nMORE: The 11 worst contracts in the NBA, based on my salary tool\n\nThe reserves will be announced on Sunday, Feb. 1.\n\nThe starters, who will be divided up among the three teams (two American, one World), have been announced and are as follows:\n\nAll-Star Weekend will take place from Friday, Feb. 13 to Sunday, Feb. 15. The event will be hosted at Intuit Dome in Inglewood, California, home of the Clippers. The schedule is as follows:\n\nNBA All-Star Celebrity Game, 7 p.m. ET (ESPN)\n\nNBA Rising Stars Game, 9 p.m. ET (Peacock)\n\nNBA HBCU Classic (Hampton University vs. North Carolina A&T State University), 11 p.m. ET (Peacock)\n\nNBA All-Star Saturday Night, 5 p.m. ET (NBC & Peacock)\n\nNBA All-Star Game, 5 p.m. ET (NBC & Peacock)",

    "fullText": "Texas A&M (17-4, 7-1 SEC) should be undefeated in SEC play if it weren't for missed free throws down the stretch of the double-overtime loss at Tennessee, as the Aggies have not lost since, and while efficient shooting, paired with improved rebounding have certainly aided the team, resulting in three straight double-digit wins, first-year head coach Bucky McMillan deserve a ton of credit for gearing the focus back to the free throw line.\n\nAs a team, the Aggies are shooting 74.8% from the stripe, while Spanish sharpshooter Ruben Dominguez leads the team at 90%, while six players are shooting 80% or better.\n\nOn Saturday, the Aggies earned their third Quad 1A win after defeating Georgia on the road 92-77, and shot 45% from the field, and 38% from beyond the arc, and outside of winning the rebounding battle 46-39, Texas A&M finished an impressive 19-20 from the free-throw line, and was perfect in the final minutes of the second half.\n\nDuring former head coach Buzz Williams' career in College Station, the Aggies struggled at the free throw line, which directly led to frustrating losses in and out of conference play, and while the offense never flourished under Williams like we've seen under McMillan this season, free throws continued to make or break outcomes for every team, no matter the play style.\n\n\"Bucky Ball\" is built on three-point shooting and high-percentage shots near the rim, while the press defense, comically dubbed the \"mother-in-law\" defense by McMillan, has continued to force turnovers, leading to fast-break points and big leads over the last three games.\n\nStill, in the last three wins, the Aggies were nearly perfect from the free throw line, converting 51-54 attempts for a 94.4% success rate, which, combined with 39 three-pointers, Texas A&M's offense has looked unstoppable, and will continue to score 90 points or more if this success at the stripe continues in conference play.\n\nWhile the size differential is notable over the next two games against Alabama on the road and Florida at home, Texas A&M's fast-paced play style frustrated Auburn and Texas, who both possessed more size in the paint, and if the Aggies continue to convert at the free throw line, anything is possible moving forward.\n\nOver its last three games combined, Texas A&M men's basketball is 51 of 54 (94.4%) from the free throw line.

    "fullText": "We asked for your thoughts after Saturday's Premier League game between Leeds and Arsenal.\n\nHere are some of your comments:\n\nEric: Offered no offensive threat or quality on the ball with our passing and distribution in the first half. With the second half changes we were much more positive but, let's be honest, Arsenal showed up our frailties and it was only ever going to be a loss. However, really BIG game against Nottingham Forest next, we can only have one result in that one or we are back in squeaky bum territory.\n\nWayne: Not a totally unexpected result but the performance was disappointing. Naive in both boxes and what does Tanaka have to do to get a game?\n\nAndrew: Farke set up wrong - Gudmundsson is not a left centre-back, he's never played there! Too defensive a set-up with Gruev and Ampadu - we gave all the attacking initiative to Arsenal and DCL was isolated again. Didn't expect much from the game and not surprised.\n\nChris: Never expected Leeds to win but thought we would have put up more of a fight. Not a single Leeds player was of Premier League quality. Farke really needs to stop with the goalkeeper experiment and just leave Perri in -Darlow is a good back-up keeper and that's about as good as he gets.\n\nChris: Madueke was excellent and after all the talk of mental strength and open-play goals - well, there's your talk for the weekend. A positive result that really quickly eases the concerns from the loss to Manchester United.\n\nSteve: Arsenal choking then? In January we played nine, won six, drew two and lost one. Doesn't feel like it to me.\n\nNeo: When I saw Madueke earlier in the season when Saka got injured - I thought he was causing a lot of problems for the opposition down the right-hand side and is great at going round the defender and crossing. I am now more convinced than ever that he should play more often and we should rotate Saka, or try Saka on the left sometimes. Maybe better to rest Saka to get him sharper when he eventually comes on. Bottom line is that Eze and Madueke needs more game time somehow.\n\nSean: Arsenal have been playing Premier League games with the weight of expectations seemingly holding them back. This could be a big step toward winning the title.",

Excited for what’s to come!”\n\nThough Kamara didn’t confirm his next destination, it would be fair to assume Blackburn Rovers are strongly in contention for the 19-year-old’s signature.\n\nAfter playing what appears to be his final game for the Arsenal u21s on January 17th, news broke that Kamara was set to be released when he reached the end of his first professional contract this summer.\n\nThe teenager started to hold trials with other clubs, and he made an appearance for Blackburn Rovers’ u21s on Monday.\n\nThough Rovers didn’t officially name him in their match report, Kamara was the triallist who entered the game against the Birmingham City u21s at half-time, and he went on to score just four minutes later with a flicked finish at the far post.\n\nWith Kamara now confirming he’s leaving Arsenal, it’s possible Rovers have made an offer to sign the player before he runs down his contract this summer. For now, we await official confirmation from the clubs involved.",

But the move is being held up by the player’s unwillingness to renew.\n\nThis also impacts the future of Davide Frattesi. Nottingham Forest have an agreement for the Italian and the player is keen. But Jones would be a replacement and if he doesn’t join, Frattesi will stay at Inter.\n\nEverything now hinges on whether Liverpool tie the Englishman down to a renewal or not. That is an attempt to raise the player’s value but it would make it difficult for the player to seek a viable destination as his value would rise.",

    "fullText": "The Magpies were beaten 4-1 at Anfield at the weekend, with the reigning champions netting twice either side of half time to cancel out Anthony Gordon's well-taken opener.\n\nRamsey and United started well on Merseyside but were undone by a Hugo Ekitike double, a Florian Wirtz effort and Ibrahima Konaté's late strike.\n\nBut speaking after the final whistle, Ramsey was keen to emphasise the importance of moving on swiftly, with the midweek trip to City - and the chance to reach another Wembley final - now firmly in their sights.\n\nHere are some of his post-match thoughts:\n\n\"I think when we look at the goals, they're from our mistakes. It was always going to be tough coming to Anfield. We had a positive result midweek and we thought we could come here and do the same.\n\n\"As a whole, I thought we played alright. We were a lot braver in the second half on the ball, playing out from the back.\n\n\"It was disappointing for the goals, but we've got another game on Wednesday so head up, be confident and go into Wednesday.\"\n\n\"I think it was the second goal, I think from their goal kick we didnt set up properly. We took too long to set up.\n\n\"But like i said, they were poor goals to concede, but we've got to keep our heads up and be confident - we can't dwell on this one.\n\n\"We'll obviously look at the mistakes and go over the game, but move on quickly.\"\n\n\"We went ahead with Gordy - a really good goal. I think their first two goals came quite quick (after). The first goal came and we weren't really settled, and they get the second two or three minutes later.\n\n\"Both two goals were a real blow when they came within two or three minutes. But we've got to move on.\"\n\n\"The gaffer said that at full time. (It's) another big game on Wednesday, 2-0 down in the Carabao Cup semi-final - we have to move on quickly.\n\n\"If you look at our next three or four fixtures, they're big games against big teams. We wanted to win here today, but we've got to keep our heads up and move on.\"\n\n\"I don't think we need lifting, to be fair. It's a semi-final, I know we're 2-0 down, but it's a semi-final of the Carabao Cup - (there are) not many bigger games, do you know what I mean? So full of confidence, head up, and keep battling.\"",

As Novak Djokovic sensed his opportunity to make history, Alcaraz wrote his own: by winning his first Australian Open title, overturning Djokovic to win 2-6 6-2 6-3 7-5 and under enormous pressure, Alcaraz becomes the youngest man of all time to complete the career grand slam at 22 years and 272 days.\n\nHe joins the illustrious list of Don Budge, Fred Perry, Rod Laver, Roy Emerson, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer, Rafael Nadal and Djokovic to win all four major titles, doing so faster than anyone else. He is more than a year younger than his compatriot Nadal was when he set the Open-era record at 2010 US Open at the age of 24. Fittingly, Nadal was courtside at the Rod Laver Arena as Alcaraz continued to walk in the 22-time grand slam champion’s footsteps, while also breaking new ground.\n\nIt was Djokovic who perhaps summed it up best: “What you've been doing, I think the best word to describe it is historic, legendary, so congratulations and I wish you the best of luck for the rest of your career. I mean, you're so young, you have a lot of time, like myself! So I'm sure we'll be seeing each other many more times in the next 10 years.”\n\nBut in doing so, Alcaraz denied Djokovic his own career-defining achievement. One way or another, history was guaranteed in a seismic final, as Djokovic attempted to claim the standalone record of 25 grand slam singles titles and become the oldest grand slam champion of all time at the age of 38. Not for the first time, the Serbian was suppressed by Alcaraz, who defeated the greatest of all time for a third time in a third grand slam final and snapped his perfect record of 10 Australian Open finals without defeat.\n\nAfter his epic effort to beat Jannik Sinner on Friday, Djokovic faded physically after making a blistering start to the final. But, as he closed in on the finish line, Alcaraz was faced to withstand a late charge from Djokovic as he forced break points late in the fourth set. Throughout his young career, though, it has been in those moments where Alcaraz rises highest. After falling to his back when Djokovic fired his final forehand long, Alcaraz broke into the widest of smiles.\n\nBoth men faced a huge test to recover for the final after coming through marathon semi-finals. Alcaraz defeated Alexander Zverev in five hours and 27 minutes in the third-longest Australian Open match of all time, before Djokovic produced one of his greatest ever performances to end Sinner’s dominant run across five sets and four hours and nine minutes. As the match finished well after midnight in Melbourne, Djokovic did not go to bed until 6am on Saturday morning and neither men trained on the day before the final as they attempted to recover.\n\nWith 15 years and 348 days between them, Djokovic said the younger man would have the advantage in the attempt to find fresh legs, but it was the elder who came flying out of the blocks. Producing a brilliant level of precise serving and replicating the huge forehand strike that was so effective in beating Sinner from the baseline in the semi-finals, Djokovic played an outstanding first set and made just four unforced errors in a 39-minute opener. The second set brought a complete reverse, however, as Djokovic’s level of serving dipped and Alcaraz won the majority of baseline points.\n\nWith the conditions in Melbourne cold and windy, the final began under a partially shut roof on Rod Laver Arena. Before the start of the third set, with the chance of rain forecast, the roof closed further, with Alcaraz complaining to the tournament referee. But, with the elements becoming less of a factor, Alcaraz delivered a magical moment to defy Djokovic when the 38-year struck a backhand winner around the net-post. Alcaraz salvaged a forehand from the baseline and, in an electric charge, broke Djokovic for a second time to move one set away from history.\n\nFaced with another comeback, Djokovic called the trainer before the start of the fourth. But in an almighty effort and across a 12-minute service game, he saved six break points to stay alive. He found more precise serving when he desperately needed it as Alcaraz led 4-3, 0-30 in the fourth. Djokovic held again, then raised the temperature of the final and brought his supporters to their feet by setting up break point. Suddenly, as the weight of history became clear, Alcaraz withstood him, as Djokovic missed a second-serve return.\n\nAfter Alcaraz held to move 6-5 ahead, the Spaniard produced the finishing blow by winning a 24-shot rally with some of his finest ball-striking of the match. It seemed to break Djokovic, as he attempted to reach the tiebreak and extend his fight. Two errors in a row from Djokovic brought match point, and a further forehand error sealed Alcaraz’s place in tennis history.",

    "description": "Carlos Alcaraz exhausted Novak Djokovic in Sunday's Australian Open final to become the youngest man in tennis' open era to earn a career Grand Slam.",
    "fullText": "Feb. 1 (UPI) -- Carlos Alcaraz's pressure and shot selection made Novak Djokovic appear as if he donned lead loafers in wet cement en route to his first Australian Open title Sunday in Melbourne.\n\n\"I think nobody knows how hard \"I've been working to get this trophy,\" Alcaraz said in the ESPN broadcast. \"It was a bit of a roller coaster emotionally. ... We just did the right work. My team was pushing me every day to do the right things.\n\n\"I'm just really grateful for everyone I have in my corner.\"\n\nWith the four-set victory, the 22-year-old Spaniard became the youngest man in tennis' Open Era (since 1968) to clinch a career Grand Slam. He also earned a $4.15 million prize, while denying his Serbian foe of a record 25th Grand Slam.\n\n\"I think the best word to describe it is historic, legendary,\" Djokovic said of Alcaraz.\n\nAlcaraz edged Djokovic 9-4 in aces, 36-32 in winners and 5-2 in converted break points in the 2-6, 6-2, 6-3, 7-5 victory at Rod Laver Arena. He also logged 27 unforced errors, compared to Djokovic's 46.\n\nDjokovic pounced early, breaking Alcaraz twice in the first set. But the former world No. 1 would not convert another break against the current No. 1 for the remainder of the 3-hour, 2-minute match.\n\nHis muscles seemed to tighten over the iconic blue hard court as Alcaraz crafted shots with his wand-like racket. The wizardry forced Djokovic, who outlasted defending champion Jannik Sinner in a 5-hour, 27-minute semifinal on Friday, to test his joints and endurance.\n\nAlcaraz broke Djokovic twice in the second set to tie the match. Djokovic and Alcaraz each held through the first four games of the third set. Alcaraz broke the Serbian for a third time in the fifth game and held in the sixth for a 4-2 lead. Each player held for the next three games.\n\nDjokovic trailed love-40 on his final service game of the set. He rallied for deuce, but Alcaraz still managed to translate the break to secure his second consecutive set victory.\n\nDjokovic unearthed a final gasp of energy in the final set, matching holds with his top-ranked foe through the first 11 games. But Alcaraz broke his final service game of the tournament. The game started with a match-long 24-shot rally and ended when Djokovic went long on his final forehand return.\n\nDjokovic, who fended off 11 break points, including six in the final set, earned $2.15 million for his efforts. He also will move from No. 4 to No. 3 in the ATP singles rankings.\n\nAlcaraz will attempt to win a third-consecutive French Open title and third-consecutive major crown at the 2026 edition of that tournament, which will be held May 24 to June 7 in Paris.\n\nThe third Grand Slam of the season -- Wimbledon 2026 -- from June 29 to July 12 in London. The 2026 U.S. Open will take place from Aug. 30 to Sept. 13 in Flushing, N.Y.\n\nAlcaraz and Sinner have combined to win the last nine major titles.",

    "fullText": "Justin Rose has produced one of the standout performances of the PGA Tour season at Torrey Pines.\n\nIn the first three rounds at the Farmers Insurance Open, the Englishman has separated himself from the field with precise golf that has rewritten the tournament record book.\n\nAs Rose built a commanding six-shot lead ahead of the final day, attention quickly turned to just how comfortable he has looked on a demanding layout.\n\nFormer PGA Tour winner Smylie Kaufman was among those watching closely, and his reaction summed up the feeling shared by many.\n\nKaufman did not hide his admiration for what he has been seeing from Rose this week.\n\n“I’m obsessed with the way Rosey is swinging the golf club,” Kaufman said.\n\n“I’ve been walking around the house doing his pre-shot routine, thinking I have this game figured out.”\n\nThe comment was delivered with humor, but it reflected a genuine appreciation for Rose’s rhythm and control.\n\nThroughout the tournament, Rose’s tempo and decision-making have stood out, particularly under pressure, as he continues to find fairways and greens with remarkable consistency.\n\nFor Kaufman, the appeal is not just the results but the simplicity of how Rose is going about his work.\n\nThere has been little sign of forcing the issue, with Rose trusting his process and letting the scores take care of themselves.\n\nRose’s performance has already secured a place in the tournament’s history.\n\nAfter rounds of 62, 65, and 68, he has broken both the 36-hole and 54-hole scoring records at Torrey Pines.\n\nThe previous 36-hole mark stood at 15 under par, which Rose eclipsed by reaching 17 under.\n\nHe then pushed past the 54-hole record of 18 under, extending it to 21 under and opening up a six-shot lead heading into the final round.\n\nThere is still more on the line. The 72-hole tournament record is 21 under par, a mark Rose himself set when he won the event in 2019.\n\nA final-round score of just one under par would see him break that record outright.\n\nWhether or not he adds another number to the record book, Rose’s week at Torrey Pines has been a reminder of his enduring quality.\n\nIt is little surprise that fellow professionals like Kaufman have been watching closely, and perhaps even borrowing a pre-shot routine or two along the way.",

    "description": null,
    "fullText": "Kessel Run, formally \"Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Detachment 12\", is a United States Air Force software development division, based in Hanscom Air Force Base and Boston, Massachusetts. It was founded in 2017 by the Defense Innovation Unit in response to the need to modernize legacy Air Force software.\n\nIn October 2016, Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google, was leading a group touring the Combined Air Operations Center at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar in his role as inaugural chairman of the Defense Innovation Board.[1] The CAOC at Al Udeid oversees air force operations for over 20 countries, and at the time was engaged in the War in Iraq against the Islamic State.[1]\n\nOne of the Air Operations Center tasks was planning daily aerial refueling operations to support combat missions. This was done off the main CAOC hall, in a windowless room with a whiteboard bearing magnetic pucks and plastic laminated cards, and physically measuring distance on the board to determine how long planes could stay in the air.[1][2] The resulting data was manually entered into an Excel spreadsheet known as \"the Gonkulator\" by a person called \"the Gonker\".[1][2] When a VBScript run on the spreadsheet confirmed the data was correct, another person, called \"the Thumper\", manually typed in the result into a Master Air Attack Planning Toolkit, which helped generate the Air Tasking Order back at Shaw Air Force Base in South Carolina.[1] Yet another person watched to verify against retyping errors.[2] The process took eight to 12 hours each day for three or eight people.[1][2][3] If there was a change needed, the process needed to restart.[2][3] When Schmidt and the Defense Information Board asked whether the base had access to more modern software to automate this process, the answer was: \"Yes, but it doesn't work.\"[1]\n\nAir Operations Center software had been in use mostly unchanged since the 1990s.[1] From 2006 to 2011, Lockheed Martin worked on the concept of modernizing it, but did not take up the project.[4] A Northrop Grumman project to modernize AOC software was commissioned in 2013 for $374 million for development, and $3.5 billion for lifetime maintenance.[4] By 2016, when the Defense Innovation Board was touring Al Udeid, nothing had been delivered.[2] The development price eventually grew to $745 million, and was three years behind schedule, with an estimated launch date of December 2019, when the project was eventually cancelled in July 2017.[4]\n\nAlso touring the Al Udeid CAOC with Schmidt in October 2016 was Raj Shah, tech entrepreneur and managing partner of DIUx, the Defense Innovation Unit Experimental.[1][2] Shah was a former Air Force fighter pilot who had first hand experience of the importance of regular aerial refueling.[2] That same night, he called lieutenant colonel Enrique Oti who was head of Air Force programs for DIUx in Silicon Valley.[1] They arranged an unusual partnership between Air Force developers and Pivotal Software, and got it approved by General Jeffrey Harrigian, commanding United States Air Forces Central Command.[1] Rather than rewrite the entire AOC software suite, they would just do the tanker whiteboard.[clarification needed][1] In December 2016, coders and program managers were visiting Al Udeid to talk to users. By April 2017, the aerial refueling tanker application, named Jigsaw, was in use at the CAOC; four months from start to production, when a more average Defense Department software operation took as much as three to five years.[1][5]\n\nThe speed of development was credited to the Agile development process, an iterative, adaptive approach, that doesn't try to get the entire solution in the first release. The first version of an application is intentionally only about a 60% solution, which is then changed and improved via rapid iterations as users give feedback.[6] Though this agile development is fairly basic in the modern software industry, it was unusual for the Defense Department.[7] The development team would later adopt the hashtag #AgileAF - the AF, they assure, stands for Air Force.[1]\n\nThe total cost of Jigsaw was reported at $1.5 million (Captain Bryon Kroger, Chief Operating Officer of the project),[5] to $2.2 million (Shah),[1] \"chump change\" (Harrigian).[8] With it, tanker planning was not only faster, taking two to three hours for a single person, but was more reliable, so two to three fewer tankers were scrambled each day.[1][3] Each scramble had a cost in fuel and maintenance of about $250,000 each.[1][2] Jigsaw saved 350,000 pounds of fuel a week.[8] Its development costs were recouped in the first week.[1][9]\n\nIn April 2017, after delivering Jigsaw, Oti, Kroger, and others, got approval to form an official Air Force software development team at the Air Force Life Cycle Management Center named Project Kessel Run.[2][10][5] The name \"Kessel Run\" came from a line in the 1977 science fiction film Star Wars, spoken by smuggler Han Solo, bragging about the speed of his ship, the Millennium Falcon.[2] It represented the project's intent to \"smuggle\" new software development capability into the Air Force and use it to set new software development speed records.[9]\n\nIn May 7, 2018, the Kessel Run Experimentation Lab set up at a WeWork shared facility in central Boston. It was modeled after Pivotal Labs training locations in Cambridge, San Francisco, and Washington.[11] It was managed from the AFLCMC at Hanscom Air Force Base, which believed the innovation advantages in coworking and creativity would outweigh the hassles of distance and security.[11][12] The Lab initially had space for 90 engineers, but planned for 300 within a year.[9] Many were on temporary assignment from other Air Force bases; yet others would be sent off to Pivotal Labs offices across the country for training in modern software techniques.[11][13][14] The Kessel Run motto on the wall was \"Code. Deploy. Win.\", a play on the Air Force's motto, \"Fly. Fight. Win.\".[12]\n\nOn January 2, 2019, the Kessel Run Experimentation Laboratory moved to a different location in a Boston skyscraper.[15] Kessel Run's budget since mid 2017 had grown to approximately $140 million, including workspace and personnel, and the operational software produced claimed savings of $13 million and 1,100 man-hours per month.[15]\n\nOn May 8, 2019, Kessel Run formally became Air Force Life Cycle Management Center Detachment 12, commanded by Colonel Oti, who had been effectively leading it for just under a year.[16] It had nearly 700 airmen, government civilians, and contractors.[16] Oti was replaced as commander by Colonel Brian Beachkofski on April 15, 2020, with the ceremony held over Zoom teleconference.[17] On June 27, 2022, Beachkofski was replaced as commander by Colonel Richard Lopez, who took the title of senior materiel leader.[18] Lopez had previously been the director of the LevelUP Code Works software factory inspired by Kessel Run.[18][19]\n\nThe March 2019 Defense Innovation Board report on software acquisitions included a chapter on Kessel Run subtitled \"The Future of Defense Acquisitions Is #AgileAF\".[21]\nIn September and October 2019, Kessel Run received multiple awards: the General Larry O. Spencer Innovation award; the Theodore von Kármán award for modernizing software for the F-35; and the inaugural Defense Acquisition Software Innovation Team award.[22][23] A 2019 editorial in Defense One said that Kessel Run was \"widely seen as the gold standard of military tech done right ... also the most hyped military program office in operation today\".[24]\n\nNot all reactions were positive. A 2019 anonymous survey of KREL application users found that some applications did not meet user needs, and that success metrics, documentation, and responsiveness to user feedback could all be lacking.[25] A 2020 Harvard Kennedy School project found and tried to address internal discontent among Kessel Run staff with emerging bureaucracy and increasing technical complexity.[26] The Air Force's Deputy Chief Information Officer, Lauren Knausenberger, acknowledged in 2020 that Kessel Run was having growing pains, but said that was a result of its success.[27]\n\nKessel Run inspired multiple agile software development teams across the Air Force and United States Department of Defense.[28] They were called \"software factories\".[29] The original definition of software factory was a set of software tools to write and automatically build, test, and document applications; the Chief Information Officer of the Department of Defense slightly redefined that to be a software assembly plant that automated the develop, build, test, release and deliver phases, but in each case to support agile software development practices.[30]\n\nKobayashi Maru, formally Space C2, or Space Command and Control, in California, was the second such software factory, in August 2018.[28] It was named after an impossible test in the Star Trek science fiction universe.[31] Just as Kessel Run came from an effort to replace an outdated system by getting around bureaucratic rules, Kobayashi Maru intended to update the software of the troubled Joint Mission System (jointly run with the United States Space Force) for space command and control and situational awareness.[32][33]\n\nBESPIN - an acronym for Business and Enterprise Systems Product Innovation, but also the name of a planet in the Star Wars universe - was the third Air Force software factory, launched in early 2019 in Montgomery, Alabama, to create apps for maintenance crew chiefs, aircrew readiness, and ammunition crews.[28][31] Space Camp, in Colorado, and Section31, in California, spun off of Kobayashi Maru.[31] LevelUP, in Texas, was a joint cyber operations system for the Unified Platform, connecting the Army, Marines, and United States Cyber Command, debuting in April 2019.[31] By September 2021, there were 17 Air Force software factories across the country.[34]\n\nSoftware factories weren't limited to the Air Force. The Navy was inspired by Kessel Run to stand up its first software factory, The Forge, in Riverdale, Maryland, in March 2021.[35] The Army Software Factory debuted in April 2021 in Austin Community College in Texas, as part of the United States Army Futures Command.[36][37] In February 2022, Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks wrote a DOD Software Modernization Strategy memo encouraging increased used of software factories throughout the Defense Department; at the time there were 29.[38] By April 2022 the United States Coast Guard was planning a software factory based on the Air Force model.[39] The Marine Corps Software Factory was co-located with the Army Software Factory as a three year test project in Austin in March 2023.[40]\n\nThe 24th Air Force's Air Force Cyber Proving Ground may be another related activity.\n\nJigsaw, the 2017 aerial refueling planning application that started Kessel Run, was bought and used by NATO in multiple countries in 2020 and 2021.[41][42]\n\nThe team's second and third projects after Jigsaw were Chainsaw and Raven, applications for assembling and communicating target information.[1] Chainsaw was in operation by November 2017, consolidated many programs into one, and cut the process for dynamic targeting from an hour or two to minutes. Raven, for target development management, cut 12 hours of work down to three or four, and was ready in early 2018.[43]\n\nStarting in late 2018, Kessel Run joined the task of fixing the troubled software for the maintenance of the F-35 fighter jet, called ALIS, for Autonomic Logistic Information System.[44] ALIS was a 17 year old proprietary system full of bugs and data gaps.[45] Maintainers had to keep separate databases because they could not rely on ALIS data.[46] The project to fix ALIS, including Kessel Run, Pivotal, and Lockheed Martin, its original creators, was called Mad Hatter, named by the developers.[44] It officially started in October 2018, but took until January 2019 before developers could write code, while the Air Force negotiated with Lockheed Martin as to what parts of the proprietary ALIS system the government could be able to reach.[44] The Mad Hatter suite of eight programs was tested and favorably evaluated by F-35 aircraft maintainers in March 2020.[47] In July 2020, it was renamed to Torque, and adapted for maintenance of the F-22 stealth jet and CV-22 tiltrotor aircraft,[48] then the C-130J turboprop in January 2021.[49] Meanwhile, on the F-35 itself, between 2020 and 2022 ALIS was gradually replaced by ODIN, the Operational Data Integrated Network, \"leveraging\" the software practices of Kessel Run, but built by Lockheed Martin.[50][51]\n\nIn 2021, Kessel Run began deploying the initial version of KRADOS, the Kessel Run All Domain Operations Suite meant to replace the Theater Battle Management Core Systems that created air tasking orders throughout AOCs all over the world.[52] The first AOC to use the suite operationally was again the 609th Air Operations Center at Al Udeid, in May 2021, after using the Beta version since December 2020.[53] KRADOS linked together nine applications through cloud-based data, including the latest version of Jigsaw, Kessel Run's first application for tanker planning, and Slapshot, for planning the rest of the air missions and building the Master Air Attack Plan.[54] In 2017, Lockheed Martin had received a $38 million contract to maintain the older TBMCS, but the 609th kept finding problems, so turned to Kessel Run, which delivered the beta version of KRADOS three weeks after receiving the request in November 2020.[55] By August 2022, the 603rd AOC in Ramstein, Germany, employed elements of KRADOS for visualization, though it was not considered mature enough to create air tasking and airspace control orders.[56][57] In January 2023, the 609th replaced the TBMCS with KRADOS entirely.[58]\n\nThe Command and Control Incident Management Emergency Response Application (C2IMERA), is a real time Air Force base resource management tool. It used a different development model: the coding was done by software company Leidos, and the program management by Kessel Run.[59] In August 2019, Moody Air Force Base used the software to monitor and prepare for Hurricane Dorian, though it was not originally intended for this purpose.[60] C2IMERA was also used for the August 2021 evacuation of civilians from Afghanistan in Operation Allies Refuge.[61][62] It was ordered deployed across all Air Combat Command installations in September 2021.[59][63] In August 2023, Air Mobility Command joined Air Combat Command in designating C2IMERA as their standard installation command and control tool.[64]\n\nSlapshot, the air mission flow organizer part of KRADOS, was also used for the Operation Allies Refuge Afghan evacuation along with C2IMERA.[65][66] At that time, KRADOS had known issues with scaling; it couldn't handle many simultaneous operations, which was exactly what it was being asked to do. On August 24, 2021, at 2 am Boston time, the Slapshot server crashed. Over the next 12 hours, Kessel Run developers restarted servers, shifted United States Central Command resources to improve performance, fixed database errors, and added new features to improve load times, so the evacuation on the other side of the world could continue.[67]\n\nBowcaster, named after a Star Wars weapon, is a chaos engineering tool and playbook that intentionally creates failures in processes to strengthen them.[68][69]\nKessel Run developed it, and shares it with other government agencies, initially with the Navy Black Pearl software factory in 2021.[70][71] In March 2022 Kessel Run and the General Services Administration's Technology Transformation Services used it to check that the Cloud.gov website could handle 100 million users per hour.[72][73]",

    "description": "Elon Musk admitted on Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call today that the company doesn’t have any Optimus robots doing useful...",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk admitted on Tesla’s Q4 2025 earnings call today that the company doesn’t have any Optimus robots doing useful work in its factories right now.\n\nThis is a striking admission, given that Musk has spent the past two years claiming the opposite.\n\nLet’s take a walk through memory lane.\n\nJune 2024: Tesla’s official account claimed the company had “2 Optimus bots performing tasks in the factory autonomously.”\n\nJune 2024: At Tesla’s shareholder meeting, Musk said he expected “a thousand to a couple thousand robots working in its factories” by 2025.\n\nJanuary 2025: On Tesla’s Q4 2024 earnings call, Musk raised the stakes even higher:\n\n“The normal internal plan calls for roughly 10,000 Optimus robots to be built this year.”\n\n“Will those several thousand Optimus robots be doing useful things by the end of the year? Yes, I’m confident they will do useful things.”\n\nToday (January 2026): Musk admitted that no Optimus robots are currently doing useful work in Tesla’s factories.\n\n“Well, we are still very much at the early stages of Optimus. It’s still in the R&D phase. We have had Optimus do some basic tasks in the factory. But as we iterate on new versions of Optimus, we deprecate the old versions. It’s not in usage in our factories in a material way. It’s more so that the robot can learn. We wouldn’t expect to have any kind of significant Optimus production volume until probably the end of this year.”\n\nThis follows a now-familiar pattern with Musk’s predictions.\n\nWe documented last month that Tesla never came close to producing thousands of Optimus robots in 2025. There was no evidence of even hundreds being built.\n\nDuring the earnings call, Musk was specifically asked about how many Optimus robots Tesla has, and he didn’t answer.\n\nWhat Tesla has demonstrated publicly are robots performing simple tasks like handing out water bottles, and even then, they relied heavily on teleoperation (humans remotely controlling the robots) rather than true autonomy.\n\nMultiple supply chain reports throughout 2025 indicated that Tesla’s Optimus program was in “shambles,” with the head of the program departing and production being delayed.\n\nIn today’s shareholder update, Tesla did mention progress on Optimus:\n\n“In Q1 of this year, we plan to unveil the Gen 3 version of Optimus, which will include major upgrades from version 2.5, including our latest hand design. The Gen 3 is our first design meant for mass production.”\n\nTesla also said it’s preparing production lines with “start of production planned before the end of 2026 and eventual planned capacity of 1 million robots per year.”\n\nBut the admission that no robots are currently doing useful work directly contradicts years of claims from both Musk and Tesla’s official communications.\n\nI want to be clear: I’m actually bullish on humanoid robots. The technology is advancing rapidly, and Tesla does have advantages in compute efficiency and AI development.\n\nBut Tesla is running full speed ($20 billion capex worth) into the same problem it had with autonomous vehicles: it builds the hardware before the software is ready.\n\nOn top of this, even though I’m bullish on humanoid (to a degree, I’m not saying its a multi-trillion dollar industry), I don’t really trust Musk leading this effort with this real credibility problem.\n\nWhen Musk claimed in January 2025 that “several thousand Optimus robots will be doing useful things by the end of the year,” he wasn’t making a long-term prediction about uncertain technology. He was making a near-term operational claim about his own company.\n\nTesla does have advantages in compute efficiency and AI development.\n\nFred, I'm gonna need a source on this. For all we know, Musk just claims to have an advantage. I'm guessing those other companies which have been building robots for decades may have a better handle on some of this stuff.\n\nNow, a year later, he’s admitting that the number is zero.\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla claimed had Optimus robots were doing “real work” in factories almost two years ago now.\n\nIt’s fairly clear for anyone who has been following the program closely that Tesla is still years away from a useful product that will be able to perform work at an efficient level beyond just demos.\n\nEven Musk appeared to somewhat admits that he the first part of his response where he said that the robot is “still very much at the early stages of Optimus. It’s still in the R&D phase.”",

    "fullText": "Criminal gangs have stolen dozens of Toyota Land Cruisers and Prados worth $8 million in just the last six weeks in Australia. The vehicles were stolen in minutes without raising any warnings, using CAN Bus hacks, and were hidden inside shipping containers behind fake walls of car parts, destined for overseas markets like the United Arab Emirates. The top model types targeted by thieves include Toyota's Hilux, Land Cruiser 300, and Prado. It’s resulted in Toyota Australia responding to the increasing number of thefts with a low-tech solution: steering locks.\n\nThieves access the Controller Area Network through the headlight or tail light wiring, the communication system connecting all electronic control units in modern vehicles. Using devices disguised as Bluetooth speakers purchased on the dark web, criminals inject false messages into the network that trick vehicles into believing a genuine key fob is present. This disables the immobilizer and unlocks doors in under two minutes without needing the actual key. Unlike older relay attacks requiring proximity to real keys, CAN injection completely bypasses smart key systems by exploiting unencrypted communication networks inside the car.\n\nJames E. Winner Jr. invented The Club in 1986, a simple metal bar that locked onto steering wheels, making vehicles impossible to steer. The devices dominated the 1990s before electronic immobilizers made them seem obsolete. Now, Toyota has released its own version, selling through Australian dealerships for about $140 USD. Constructed from automotive-grade steel with four-point contact technology, Toyota's bright red lock aims to deter thieves through visibility. The company also promises additional security enhancements, including a new immobilizer, though details remain undisclosed to avoid tipping off criminals.\n\nHigh-tech hackers armed with custom electronics designed to exploit vehicle computer networks are being countered with essentially the same technology that protected pre-computer cars. While Toyota develops proper software fixes, owners must now manually attach a physical lock each time they park. The automotive industry's rush toward connectivity has created vulnerabilities that need old-fashioned solutions to address.",

    "fullText": "Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., urged House Republicans on a lawmaker-only call to rally behind President Donald Trump after the commander in chief struck a deal with Senate Democrats to avert a prolonged government shutdown, Fox News Digital was told Friday evening.\n\nThe top House Republican admitted to being \"frustrated\" by the result, sources told Fox News Digital, but he lauded Trump's deal-making ability and called for lawmakers to back the president's decision.\n\nThe Senate passed a revamped government funding deal Friday that will set the federal budget through the end of the fiscal year Sept. 30, save for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).\n\nIt comes after Democrats walked away from a bipartisan plan to fully fund the federal government over demands for stricter guardrails on Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) than what the initial House-passed package included.\n\nThe Hitchhiker’s Guide To Why There May Be A Partial Government Shutdown Saturday\n\nJohnson told House Republicans he went to the White House Wednesday to lay out his arguments for sticking to the initial plan and warned, \"Opening the Pandora's Box of amending this thing could be a dangerous prospect,\" sources said.\n\nTrump nevertheless struck an agreement with Senate Democrats.\n\nFox News Digital was told that Johnson conceded, \"The president has made a play call, and we have to support him on it.\"\n\nThe initial bipartisan DHS bill included guardrails for ICE, such as mandating body-worn cameras and training for public engagement and de-escalation. But Democrats are now demanding significantly more after a second deadly shooting of a U.S. citizen by federal law enforcement during demonstrations against Trump’s immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.\n\nSenate Gop Holdouts Refuse To Budge As Shutdown Talks Continue\n\nThe new deal struck with Democrats would only extend current DHS funding levels for two weeks to keep other critical agencies under the department’s purview funded while new bipartisan negotiations on immigration enforcement play out.\n\nMultiple Republican lawmakers have both publicly and privately expressed concern about the deal, arguing it could potentially give Democrats more ability to constrain the administration.\n\nOne House Republican voiced such concerns on the lawmaker-only call on Friday, Fox News Digital was told. Johnson, according to sources, agreed he was \"frustrated … but I've got to tip my hat to the president. He knows the art of the deal.\"\n\nSenate Republicans Weigh Dem Demand To Split Dhs Bill, Turn To Short-term Extension To Avoid Shutdown\n\nJohnson told House Republicans that Trump now needed their support to \"navigate the next two weeks\" of deal-making with Democrats.\n\nTrump said on Truth Social of his deal with Democrats, \"I am working hard with Congress to ensure that we are able to fully fund the Government, without delay. Republicans and Democrats in Congress have come together to get the vast majority of the Government funded until September, while at the same time providing an extension to the Department of Homeland Security (including the very important Coast Guard, which we are expanding and rebuilding like never before).\"\n\nSources said the speaker did sound optimistic about Republicans still having leverage in the talks, however. Johnson noted that ICE had already been funded under Trump’s \"big, beautiful bill\" and that it would be offices like the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) that would run low on funds.\n\nSources said Johnson said of Democrats, \"We can hang that on their necks.\"\n\nThe House is expected to take up the legislation by Monday evening.\n\nOriginal article source: 'Opening Pandora's Box': Mike Johnson backs Trump after warning White House about deal with Democrats",

    "fullText": "The shooting deaths of white protesters Alex Pretti and Renee Good by federal officers in Minneapolis followed a playbook that is painfully familiar to Black Americans: Authorities quickly moved to disparage the victims, only to be contradicted as more evidence emerged.\n\nBlack families who have lost loved ones to police violence said the killings in Minnesota have brought back painful memories of their own fights for justice as law enforcement agencies spun up narratives to suggest officers had no other choice but to kill their relatives.\n\nAnd these law enforcement agencies often make no effort to publicly correct misstatements or falsehoods that might have impact on a fair justice process, experts said.\n\nTimothy Welbeck, the director of the Center for Anti-Racism at Temple University, said it “regrettably” took the deaths of Pretti and Good to again shine a spotlight on this issue.\n\n“Black people have leveled a critique against law enforcement for as long as we’ve had policing in America,” said Welbeck, an assistant professor at Temple’s Africology and African American Studies Department.\n\nHe also called it “painfully ironic” that Pretti and Good died in “the same place” where other high-profile cases brought the issue to the fore: George Floyd, who was murdered in 2020 by a Minneapolis police officer, and Philando Castile, who was fatally shot in 2016 as he tried to show a suburban Minneapolis police officer his license to carry a concealed firearm.\n\nClarence Castile, an uncle of Philando Castile, said it was eerie to hear federal authorities make snap conclusions in the Pretti and Good shootings.\n\n“Right away they backed up their officers and said they had justifiable shoots, their lives were in danger, they feared for their lives,” Castile said. “I heard the same thing, (officials) said the same things when that cop shot my nephew.”\n\n“We know, from the beginning, that they haven’t taken the time to investigate,\" he said. \"They’re just putting out something, because they think they have to respond. Sometimes the best response is no response.”\n\n‘Protecting the integrity of the investigation’\n\nLeonard Sipes, who worked for 35 years in public affairs and communications for federal and state law enforcement agencies and is also a former officer, said the standard practice for shootings or any other major breaking case is to simply state that “it's under investigation.” Sipes said he typically waited 24 hours before releasing information to the public.\n\n“Getting the story correct is vital to the reputation of the agency,” Sipes said. “You are also obligated to protect the integrity of the investigation. A rush to judgment can violate that.”\n\nThe killings of Pretti, a Veterans Affairs hospital ICU nurse, and Good, who described herself as a poet, mother and wife, quickly became rallying cries for Minnesotans protesting the largest surge of federal law enforcement into an American city.\n\nAfter Pretti and Good were killed, administration officials from Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to President Donald Trump claimed the two were far-left radicals acting with malicious intent to harm federal officers.\n\n“The sickening lies told about our son by the administration are reprehensible and disgusting,” Pretti’s family said in a statement this week, noting that videos showed Pretti holding his phone, not a gun, when he was tackled by federal agents before he was shot several times. “Please get the truth out about our son.”\n\nGood was remembered by her family as “the beautiful light of our family and brought joy to anyone she met.”\n\n“She was our protector, our shoulder to cry on and our scintillating source of joy.”\n\nWhile Justice Department officials have declined to launch a civil rights investigation into Good’s death, on Friday they announced a civil rights probe into Pretti’s killing.\n\nStill, officials have not walked back claims that Pretti and Good were avowed extremists who intended to harm federal agents when they were killed.\n\nFrustration over past and present cases\n\nSome Black activists and police reform advocates expressed frustration that people who are outraged by how the Pretti and Good cases have been handled often ignored the same dynamics when the victims were Black.\n\n“Ultimately, this demonstrates the insidious nature of racism and how it’s embedded its ways into the systems and structures of society,” Welbeck said. “When Black people try to point out not only the logical fallacies of it, but just the callousness of it, we were often lambasted or told that we were overreacting and needed to wait for justice to play itself out.”\n\nMelina Abdullah, co-founder of Black Lives Matter Grassroots, said it’s a common misconception that Black racial justice organizers won’t get active when white people die at the hands of law enforcement.\n\n“I want to be very clear that I mourn and rage about the murder of Alex Pretti and Renée Good,” said Abdullah, organizer of a national hub for BLM chapters. “What they suffered is what Black people suffer every single day, and it doesn’t make it right for them, but it’s also not right for us.”\n\nJustin Hansford, who participated in Black Lives Matter protests after the 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, said the Minneapolis shootings should be a reminder to all Americans that injustice disproportionately impacting Black people can impact them, too.\n\n“It’s the idea that Black folks were always the ones whose experience signaled to the rest of the country what was soon to come,” said Hansford, a professor at the Howard University School of Law and executive director of the Thurgood Marshall Civil Rights Center.\n\n“It was because this is the Black experience that you looked at it narrowly, and you failed to address it. And then the experience becomes mimicked nationally.”\n\nTulsa shooting victim's sister knows Minneapolis families' pain\n\nTiffany Crutcher, the twin sister of Terence Crutcher, a Black man killed in 2016 by a Tulsa, Oklahoma, police officer, said she couldn’t watch videos showing the killings of Pretti and Good. Just hearing authorities speak about their deaths was re-traumatizing, she said.\n\nShe’s “been there before,” she said, recalling how law enforcement officials made snap judgements about her brother.\n\nCrutcher's family maintained that Terence was in need of help after his vehicle stalled on the road. The officer who fatally shot him claimed she feared he was reaching into his car for a weapon. Terence Crutcher was unarmed.\n\nVideo footage from the scene recorded an operator saying Terence “looks like a bad dude” who “could be on something.” Ultimately, the officer who shot him was acquitted at trial for manslaughter.\n\n“In our trauma and shock, we had to control the narrative about who Terrence was,” Tiffany said. “While we’re grieving and mourning, at the same time, we have to rally and let the world know that our loved one did not deserve to die.”\n\nShe said the Pretti and Good shootings are helping people wake up to the problem of unequal justice for people killed by police.\n\n“Naturally, there’s an affinity more broadly towards law enforcement and people believing them,\" Tiffany said. “However, I think that is shifting.”\n\n\"Our voice is all that we have. And we made a conscious decision that we were going to utilize our voice and get ahead of the harmful narratives.”\n\nAP writer Matt Brown in Washington, D.C., contributed.",

    "title": "5 Cars With Transmissions That Are Basically Unbreakable",
    "description": "If your transmission needs repairs or worse, completely replaced, you are looking at hefty bills. Here are five cars with unbreakable transmissions.",
    "fullText": "When an engine fails, the loss is immediate, and usually very apparent via smoke, noise, and a loss of some or all power. When a transmission fails, however, it's much more subtle and insidious, starting with slipping gears, a jerk here, a shudder there. The next level up would be harsh shifts, culminating in no power being given to the wheels at all. Transmission repair bills are among the highest on cars, and for older vehicles, the cost of a transmission repair can exceed the value of the car (or truck) itself. That's why vehicles that have reliable transmissions are worth their weight in gold. Given that cars that have manual transmissions have been becoming rarer in recent years, all of the ones on this list are automatic units.\n\nHowever, the transmissions we list are all extraordinarily different from one another, sharing nothing but their reliability and durability in common, really. We avoided new cars, because we didn't have reliable data to prove longevity in those cases. Readers are requested to note that, obviously, not every vehicle that has the same transmission will also last the same miles; as there could be any number of differences between two vehicles that share the same transmission. The individual upkeep, maintenance, and climate of a used car will have a lot of bearing on how its transmission will hold up. It is always prudent to do in-depth research before making a purchase decision, and thoroughly inspect any pre-owned car before buying. With all that said, here are five cars that have unbreakable transmissions.\n\nWe kick things off with the first-generation Toyota Tacoma that ran from 1995 to 2004. Though Toyota had been making pickups before, the Tacoma was the first time the company named a model. The first gen Tacomas were available with three different engine choices that included a 2.4-liter four-banger, a 2.7-liter four-cylinder, and a 3.4-liter V6, with a couple different transmission options, including both manuals and automatics.\n\nWe specifically want to talk about the Aisin A340 transmission, which could be equipped to all three of those engines. The biggest V6 powerplant made an impressive 190 hp and 220 lb-ft of torque, and the first-gen was available in three cab configurations: double, access, and regular; with bed lengths of 5, 6, and 7 feet respectively. Regular cabs could also be had with a 6-foot bed. As far as the transmission itself goes, the A340 was a four-speed automatic gearbox that was first launched in 1985.\n\nThe gearbox shares Toyota's legendary reliability, because, well, Toyota actually owns Aisin, at least in part. As far as reliability goes, the Tacoma (as a whole) has a 25.3% chance of lasting until 250,000 miles, according to iSeeCars. This is more than five times the average vehicle's chance of reaching that mileage on the odo, which is all that needs to be said about the Aisin A340. The good news for prospective buyers is that even if an A340 transmission needs work, parts are cheap, and internet help is plentiful.\n\nMany people will have heard something along the lines of \"this car is equipped with a ZF transmission,\" and that's with good reason. What people don't realize is that ZF is actually a Germany-based company that designs transmissions, and then licenses that design to carmakers across the world. We daresay that ZF, which is an acronym for the company's full name, Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen, is one of the most popular transmission manufacturers in the world. The 2019 Dodge RAM 2500 is just one of many brands that happens to use an eight-speed automatic from ZF. We specifically included the RAM 2500 because it, too, ranks well in the iSeeCars study on vehicles likely to reach 250,000 miles, with a 17.3% probability of doing so.\n\nThat number is 1.3 times the average for the pickup truck segment, which is fairly impressive. Only the units that had the 6.4-liter Hemi engine as an option could be had with this gearbox, which is a shame, since it's one of the most reliable transmissions of all time. In fact, we've also listed a ZF eight-speed — which mechanics praise a lot –before, on our list of the best transmissions ever that were fitted to production cars. As things stand, the most recent RAM 2500 models are still available with an eight-speed box from ZF, albeit an updated version. It's worth noting that the RAM 1500 has actually been using the ZF eight-speed since 2013, but the 1500 ranks lower than the 2500 in the iSeeCars study.\n\nDodge has long been obsessed with making its muscle cars the most powerful ones on the market. But, with great power, comes great torque, and Dodge (which is now one of the many brands owned by Stellantis) had to come up with a gearbox that could handle all that oomph. Its solution for the 2015 models was to simply use an existing gearbox, which ended up being the 6060, manufactured by a company called Tremec. This same six-speed, RWD gearbox is also used in other high-performance models, such the Camaro ZL1 from Chevrolet. In both the Camaro ZL1 and the Challengers that are equipped with it, the Tremec 6060 is rated to handle 650 lb-ft of torque. At the root of it, the 6060 improved durability by just making a lot of components bigger, thicker, and more load-bearing.\n\nFor instance, some items on the 6060 that got larger (versus the old non-magnum T56) include the roller bearings on the input shafts, mainshaft, the teeth on the number three and four synchros, and the gear cogs themselves, among others. Interestingly, Tremec also markets a souped-up version of the 6060 as the T56 Magnum, which is likely an ode (but largely unrelated) to the T56 transmission that was used in the legendary Dodge Viper two decades ago. Additionally, readers should also note that the Challenger is not listed on the iSeeCars study, but for all the points we mentioned above, we decided to include it in our piece.\n\nWe're back to the kings of reliability, Toyota, with this next one, as it comes in the form of the Toyota 4Runner. It is one of their five mid-size SUVs –and, contrary to popular belief, Toyota only actually makes one full-size SUV, which is the Sequoia. Back to the 4Runner though; there have only been six distinct generations of 4runner since the model was introduced back in 1984, which really brings out the brand's \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it\" design philosophy. We specifically want to talk about the fourth and fifth generation 4runners, that ran from 2003 to 2024 — so, just over two decades — as these used the bulletproof A750 transmission.\n\nWhat many people might not realize is the fact that this box is also made by Aisin, who made the A340 that we introduced you to above. It makes sense — a very reliable car company will be expected to have very reliable transmissions, and Aisin seems to keep on delivering, at least according to owners on forums like Toyota-4runner.org. As far as the unit itself goes, the 750 is actually branded and produced by Toyota, which is an important distinction, as variants of the 750 are also used in cars from other companies, most notably, Suzuki and Mitsubishi. The Toyota A750s come in two variants, 2WD and 4WD, designated with the suffix of \"E\" and \"F\" respectively, with the most serious problem seemingly being a solenoid failure. The design was so robust that it later gave rise to a six-speed variant, called the AB60E, albeit with modifications.\n\nIt should surprise no one that the next vehicle on our list is another utility-focused one, in the form of the Ford Super Duty. We specifically want to focus on the 2011-2019 model years, as these were when the F-250 was shipping with the 6r140 transmission, made by Ford themselves. Note that there was another six-speed Ford Transmission known as the 6r80 (that was also pretty reliable, actually), though the 6r80 was intended for lighter-duty applications, such as in Transit vans and the F-150. Further, the 6r80 (and, unfortunately, the 6r140) would eventually be phased out in favor of a 10-speed transmission down the line, which had a slew of problems.\n\nAnd yes, the 6r140 was available in most of the Super Duty range from Ford, starting with the F-250, and going all the way up to the behemoth F-550. Given that vehicles from this range are intended to be workhorses, it's no surprise that Ford engineered these to last a long time. For instance, the 6r140 can handle over 1,000 pounds of torque, and has intelligent systems that downshift earlier when going downhill with a trailer.\n\nThat rugged engineering is probably a factor in the F-450 getting a 28.5% chance of reaching the 250,000-mile mark on the odometer, at least according to the same iSeeCars findings. That score is 2.2 times the average pickup truck's chance of reaching that mileage, and, interestingly, the F-150 actually performs half below the average, with just a 5.9% chance of reaching that mark.\n\nTo begin our research, we first shortlisted several reliable car models, and then looked into the transmissions that they had, and then, to whittle the list down, we did a few things. Say that we wanted to include a transmission named \"X\" on this list. First, we identified a model that carries that transmission, and looked it up on AutoTempest. If a large number of these cars were above 100-150k miles, that's checkbox one.\n\nSecond, we looked at the iSeeCars score for \"probability of reaching 250,000 miles.\" Third was to look at online sources, mainly garages and mechanic reviews, and some editorial reviews where they were available, preferably from authors who'd been hands-on with the cars. Where a large number of models had the same transmission, we chose to go with the most famous or the most sold one, as applicable.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "Shopping for a good brand of tires can be tough, especially if you're doing the research yourself. Digging through endless websites is exhausting, but you don't want to get stuck with a tire brand that has the lowest customer satisfaction rating. The same goes for the retailer you buy those tires from, which is why you might want to think twice before choosing Walmart Auto Center.\n\nAccording to Consumer Reports' member survey results, Walmart ranks lowest in overall customer satisfaction. This is based on the time required to complete the installation and the quality of the service provided during installation. Securing a timely appointment is also problematic, and obtaining the specific tire model required is an issue as well. This may even include tires from some of the best-selling brands at Walmart. The company's extras aren't as impressive as those of other tire retailers, and sales assistance is rated below the competition.\n\nJ.D. Power ranks Walmart last in customer satisfaction as well, using many of the same metrics as Consumer Reports. In addition to ease of scheduling, service completion time, and other factors, Walmart underperforms relative to competitors in the quality of its service facilities. The service advisor's courtesy level is also rated below that of other tire retailers.\n\nWalmart may be the lowest-rated tire retailer, but several other national chains rank below average as well. Pep Boys, Mavis Discount Tire, and Tires Plus are among the companies that underperform in terms of overall customer satisfaction. Among the highest-ranking tire retailers, Les Schwab Tire Centers, Midas, and Jiffy Lube are top choices for tire installation, service, and other key metrics that define a satisfying customer experience.\n\nWhen trying to choose the best tire retailer, don't wait until you really need the tires. You'll feel the pressure to get a set as quickly as possible. This could cause you to overlook key perks like rotation and balancing, which some retailers offer free for the life of the tires. Also, be sure you understand the store's warranty and the protection it gives beyond the manufacturer's warranty. Read customer reviews, and when it comes to the price, don't be afraid to ask for a better deal.\n\nIf you're looking to get your tires online, there are some things you need to know beforehand. Be sure the company has a secure payment setup, along with clearly displayed contact information. Review the return policy to understand how it works. Some retailers can ship your tires to a local garage, so find out if there are any fees associated with that arrangement. Get the total price upfront and compare it with local retailers to make a more informed decision.\n\nWe used Consumer Reports' Most and Least Satisfying Tire Retailers list, published in 2025. CR ranked 32 national tire retailers based on data from CR members who reported their tire purchase experiences over a one-year period, beginning in the fall of 2023. These members may not represent the general US population. We also used J.D. Power's Aftermarket Service Index study, which was also released in 2025. This study ranks 16 national tire retailers based on feedback collected from consumer surveys. That feedback was then weighted and benchmarked over time.\n\nWe did not include ratings from the Better Business Bureau (BBB) or reviews from any tire retailer's website. BBB complaints do not provide reliable metrics, as consumer complaints are reported and organized by location rather than by company. Online reviews also do not aggregate information effectively and can vary from one store to the next. As a result, these reviews are random, inconsistent, and often biased.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends? You can also add us as a preferred search source on Google.",

    "description": "Two Business Insider reporters attended Starbucks' Investor Day and got a firsthand look at how the brand plans to build momentum with its turnaround.",
    "fullText": "Starbucks' new \"Ristretto\" concept, as the company called it — named after the short-pulled espresso shot — aims to reduce average build costs by about 20% while optimizing overall footprint, Chief Financial Officer Cathy Smith said.\n\nThe walk-thru mockup featured cushy furniture, digital menus, merch displays, and a callback to Starbucks' 1971 founding above the door.\n\nSmith forecast 600 to 650 new stores opening globally in the current fiscal year, rising to over 2,000 in fiscal year 2028. Roughly 400 of the new US coffeehouses coming by 2028 are expected to be company-owned.\n\nWalking through the coffeehouse setup, with Simple Plan's \"I'm Just a Kid\" playing on the speakers, it was hard not to think back to our teenage years when Starbucks was the hangout spot, which perhaps was the point.\n\nExecs stressed Starbucks' desire to become a \"third place.\"\n\n\"We have a unique opportunity to connect people over coffee during a time when loneliness is pervasive,\" Global Chief Brand Officer Tressie Lieberman said.\n\nThe furniture, including the \"Starbucks lounge icon,\" as the display next to the chair pictured above read, was designed to get people to sit and hang out for a while.\n\nNiccol said the company plans to add 25,000 additional seats to its US company-operated stores by the end of its fiscal year and replace thousands more with \"more comfortable options.\"\n\n\"Customers are already responding with longer dwell times and, frankly, improved customer satisfaction and connections,\" he added.\n\nStarbucks plans to introduce digital menu boards in all of its US company-operated stores over the next 18 months, separating its morning and afternoon menus to better target customer preferences.\n\n\"The morning is very much a ritual,\" Niccol said during the company's earnings call on Wednesday. \"The afternoon is really a reset — and depending on where you are in that reset, you sometimes want a blended drink, you sometimes want an energy drink, you sometimes want a sparkling drink, and you sometimes want protein.\"\n\nStarbucks plans to expand its wellness offerings to meet that demand.\n\nStarbucks offered samples of global flavors like an ube macchiatto, a reformulated Chai latte with mango cold foam, and a strawberry açaí refresher, available three ways: decaffeinated, caffeinated, or with an energy boost.\n\nWe also sampled some bakery items, including a croissant-like uzu citrus blossom with a tasty uzu filling.\n\nStarbucks is rolling out new front and back-end technologies to make baristas' jobs easier — and help you get your order faster.\n\nThe company's mobile app has gotten a facelift, and a new loyalty program is rolling out in March. Its new point-of-sale system, also coming this year, aims to reduce staff training time and the time it takes to place an order.\n\nThe Mastrena III espresso machine, rolling out in 2027, halves the time it takes to brew espresso while maintaining the quality, Starbucks says.\n\nStarbucks also showed off Green Dot Assist, an AI-powered assistant that gives baristas recipes and other information about an order on a tablet to speed up production.\n\nThe Q&A session lasted nearly an hour, during which analysts pressed the executives for more specifics on their plan.\n\nDespite the optimism onstage, investors pressed executives on the company's long-term plan. Shares slid about 1% during the presentations, after a brief pop earlier in the week before earnings.\n\nThe execs responded to several questions about Starbucks' operating margins and its recent deal with Boyu Capital to sell off 60% of its China business. Investors also wanted more details on how Starbucks will navigate ongoing supply chain snarls and encourage employees to have an \"ownership mentality\" to grow with the brand.\n\nAbout five hours after it began, Rodriguez left investor day buzzing with caffeine and headed back to Business Insider's New York headquarters.\n\nOn the West Coast, Business Insider's Katherine Tangalakis-Lippert — equally caffeinated after a 3 a.m. wake-up — was already on the phone with analysts. Their verdict: Starbucks has gone on offense, laying out growth plans that are credible, if not exactly blockbuster.\n\nTogether, the two reporters walked away with a sharper view of where Starbucks' strategy is headed next.\n\nThe company hopes it can reignite momentum by making its cafés more inviting and pushing harder on menu innovation. There's still work to do — but Starbucks believes its comeback is no longer theoretical.\n\nDo you have a story to share about Starbucks?

    "description": "(Corrects by removing former paragraphs 22-23 with incorrect reference to criminal defendent Abdikadir Noor being plaintiff in civil lawsuit) By Brad Brooks and Joseph Ax MINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters)",
    "fullText": "(Corrects by removing former paragraphs 22-23 with incorrect reference to criminal defendent Abdikadir Noor being plaintiff in civil lawsuit)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS, Jan 28 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump warned Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey on Wednesday he was \"playing with fire\" for insisting that local police would refrain from enforcing federal immigration laws, a day after the president said he intended to \"de-escalate a ​little bit\" in the city.\n\nAmid the mixed signals from the White House, tensions remained high in Minneapolis, where observers and activists said deportation raids carried out by Trump's \"Operation Metro Surge\" had not slackened but ‌seemed more targeted on Wednesday.\n\nThe city has been convulsed by running confrontations between protesters and heavily armed immigration agents, with unrest heightened after two U.S. citizens were shot dead by federal officers - Renee Good on January 7 and Alex Pretti on Saturday.\n\nDemonstrations have spread to cities large and ‌small across the country in recent weeks, with Minneapolis finding its way into the pop culture on Wednesday as singer-songwriter Bruce Springsteen released a protest song honoring Pretti and Good.\n\nIn one sign of how immigration agents might be changing their tactics, an internal memo reviewed by Reuters directed officers to avoid unnecessary communication and engagement with protesters.\n\nA day after striking a conciliatory tone in their public comments following weeks of heated rhetoric, Trump and other top administration officials were talking tough again on Wednesday.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said on social that federal agents had arrested 16 people on Wednesday in Minnesota for allegedly assaulting, resisting or impeding federal law enforcement.\n\n\"Nothing will stop us from continuing to make arrests and enforce the law,\" Bondi ⁠wrote.\n\nA federal judge in Minneapolis said on Wednesday that it was the U.S. ‌Immigration and Customs Enforcement that was flouting the law by ignoring dozens of federal court orders during the immigration enforcement surge this month.\n\nWhile canceling a contempt-of-court hearing for acting ICE chief Todd Lyons, after the agency belatedly complied with an order to release a wrongly detained Ecuadorean man, U.S. District Judge Patrick Schlitz listed at least 96 court orders he said ‍ICE has violated in 74 cases.\n\n\"This list should give pause to anyone - no matter his or her political beliefs - who cares about the rule of law,\" Schlitz wrote. \"ICE has likely violated more court orders in January 2025 than some federal agencies have violated in their entire existence.\"\n\nAt the same time, the two immigration officers who opened fire on Pretti have been placed on administrative leave, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security spokesperson, adding that it was \"standard protocol.\"\n\nTrump's administration had indicated on Tuesday ​it would soften its approach, dispatching border czar Tom Homan to take over the operation from Gregory Bovino, the Border Patrol official whose aggressive tactics drew widespread criticism and legal challenges.\n\nA senior administration official said Homan's arrival ‌would mark a shift to more traditional, narrowly aimed operations rather than the broad street sweeps Bovino had led in multiple cities.\n\nThat change appeared codified in a newly issued internal ICE directive instructing agents to avoid engaging with \"agitators\" while on duty, warning that an antagonistic posture \"serves no purpose other than inflaming the situation.\"\n\nThe guidance, reviewed by Reuters, also orders ICE officers only to go after immigrants who have criminal charges or convictions, a departure from earlier tactics that had included randomly questioning individuals on the street about their immigration status.\n\nObservers and activists told Reuters that ICE activity appeared to slow somewhat on Tuesday before resuming in full on Wednesday, though in a more targeted manner than before.\n\nOn Wednesday, ICE agents were seen in several parts of the city rolling up to homes and businesses in caravans of three vehicles with six to eight agents in total, then knocking on doors and looking around, seemingly for a specific ⁠person.\n\nIf that person were not found, observers said, the agents were seen leaving. In past weeks, agents might have begun approaching people ​and demanding documented proof of legal status.\n\nUnder mounting political pressure, Trump had dialed back his rhetorical attacks on Frey and Governor ​Tim Walz after speaking with both Democrats in the wake of Pretti's killing, vowing to work with them to ease friction.\n\nBut on social media on Wednesday, Trump faulted Frey for reiterating the position of local leaders that the city would not enforce immigration laws. Trump wrote: \"Could somebody in his inner sanctum please explain that this statement is a very serious violation of the ‍Law, and that he is PLAYING WITH FIRE!\"\n\nTrump has threatened ⁠to cut off funding for states that include so-called sanctuary jurisdictions, which limit how much cooperation they give federal immigration authorities.\n\nIn response, Frey wrote on social media, \"The job of our police is to keep people safe, not enforce fed immigration laws.\"\n\nPretti, 37, an intensive care nurse, was shot dead during protests near his home on Saturday, and some administration officials immediately accused him of planning to kill officers, citing the handgun ⁠he was carrying.\n\nBut video verified by Reuters showed Pretti held only a phone in his hand when Border Patrol agents pushed him to the ground. Video also showed that an agent found Pretti's gun near his waist and removed it seconds before another agent shot a ‌restrained Pretti in the back.",

    "description": "As US-Canada relations grow rocky, Canada is rethinking its economy, its alliances, and its place on the world stage under Mark Carney.",
    "fullText": "It's a best-of-times, worst-of-times scenario for Canada on the global stage.\n\nTo get the bad out of the way, its most important ally — the United States — has grown increasingly antagonistic, with renewed tariff threats and talk of annexation coming from the White House. On the upside, Canada is signaling it can stand more firmly on its own. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney has identified a \"rupture\" in North American integration and is moving his country in a more self-sufficient direction — both economically and politically. There's a recognition that Canada and the US will always be deeply intertwined — Americans aren't suddenly going to stop watching \"Heated Rivalry\" or \"Schitt's Creek,\" and the Toronto Maple Leafs aren't going to stop traveling south of the border — but some level of unwinding may now be unavoidable.\n\n\"Every country has to take care of itself,\" says Tony Stillo, director of Canada Economics at Oxford Economics, \"and Canada's putting Canada first.\"\n\nIn a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos in January, Carney struck a determined, defiant tone toward the US and a decades-old rules-based international order that, in his view, is now falling apart. \"Canadians know that our old comfortable assumptions that our geography and alliance memberships automatically conferred prosperity and security — that assumption is no longer valid,\" he said. In turn, he's made the choice to take on \"the world as it is, not wait around for a world we wish it to be.\"\n\nCarney is walking a fine line. He is right that the US is no longer as reliable a partner as it once was in the economy, security, and trade. And as much as President Donald Trump has turned the divide into a chasm, the fracture has been forming for years, as both Democratic and Republican administrations in the US have taken a more protectionist stance.\n\nAt the same time, Canada can't just walk away. Exports account for a third of Canada's GDP, and more than 75% of its exports go to the US. By comparison, exports are about one-tenth of the US's GDP, and around 16% of its exports go to Canada. Many of the two countries' biggest industrial sectors, including automotives and energy, are almost irreversibly interwoven. The uncertainty emanating from the US has a big impact on Canada's economy — as the saying goes, when the US catches a cold, Canada gets the flu.\n\nThere is also a short-term impetus to keep relations amicable. The US-Mexico-Canada trade deal (formerly known as NAFTA) is up for review mid-year, and the US, thanks to its sheer size, has more leverage.\n\n\"The prime minister's in an impossible situation. It is incredibly challenging for any Canadian on the international side right now to both vigorously defend our economy and to do that without escalating an already volatile relationship,\" says Dan Kelly, the president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. \"The pope himself, I think, would struggle to find the patience to deal with the US administration right now.\"\n\nCanada is trying to reduce its reliance on the US through a series of policies aimed at growing and integrating its domestic economy. The federal government removed internal trade barriers that prevented goods and even workers from flowing between provinces. The IMF estimates that fully eliminating them would boost real Canadian GDP by 7%. Many Canadian consumers are opting to buy Canadian products where possible. Under Carney, the country established the Major Projects Office as part of a push to advance nation-building ventures and streamline regulatory approvals for ambitious programs in mining, energy, ports, and rail.\n\n\"The government isn't trying to just invest, they're trying to catalyze and incentivize private money to come in,\" Stillo says.\n\nThese are steps in the right direction, but the major projects will take years to build. This is a long-term undertaking.\n\n\"We have high-talent workers. We're the most educated in the OECD. We have real innovation in areas like AI and quantum computing, and we have natural resources — critical minerals, LNG, oil and gas — most countries would absolutely love to have,\" says Matthew Holmes, the chief of public policy at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce. \"We have all the preconditions to be an energy superpower and a major player economically, but we need to get our domestic economy fundamentals.\"\n\nKelly tells me about a third of CFIB's members, which are small- and medium-sized businesses, have started to do more business internationally in countries beyond the US, and a third are doing more internal trade. A recent business survey from the Bank of Canada found that sentiment remains \"subdued,\" though firms' overall outlook has improved slightly.\n\nPart of the problem Canada faces is that any move it makes to cultivate ties elsewhere may elicit an outsize reaction from its neighbors to the south. Just look at its recent trade negotiations with China. Carney visited China in January and subsequently announced that Canada would allow 49,000 Chinese electric vehicles into the Canadian market at a 6.1% tariff rate, while China agreed to lower tariffs on Canadian canola seed. When Trump caught wind of it, he threatened to put 100% tariffs on Canadian goods coming into the US. Canada has tried to calm the situation, emphasizing that it's not entering a free trade agreement with China, it's just settling some preexisting disputes. The tit-for-tat also comes as Canadian oil sales in China surge, as it pushes into Asia.\n\n\"We're not running into the arms of China,\" says Julian Karaguesian, a course lecturer in McGill University's economics department. \"We're just looking to take a couple of eggs out of this basket and spread them around the world. And China's the largest economy in the world after the United States.\"\n\nCanada has trade opportunities outside the US and has set a goal to double non-US exports over the next decade. It already has a robust set of free trade agreements and is the only G7 nation to have them with all other G7 members. It's also likely looking toward India and MERCOSUR, a trade bloc in South America.\n\nCommerce Secretary Howard Lutnick has downplayed the ongoing spat, calling it \"political noise\" coming out of the prime minister. He said Canada has the \"second-best deal in the world\" with the US, behind Mexico. Lutnick also indicated that getting too close to China could hurt Canada amid the USMCA talks set for the summer and create a \"road map\" for overhauling the entire deal. Given the constantly changing nature of the US and Canada's relationship as of late — and Trump's ever-shifting focus on a variety of issues — the possible scenarios for USMCA negotiations run the gamut, from minor adjustments to a total breakdown in talks.\n\n\"With USMCA, the gloves are going to be off,\" Karaguesian says.\n\nNone of this is to say that Canada is in sterling shape. Its economy is growing at a lackluster pace, and its labor market is doing OK, but not great. Productivity has been lagging for years. It would surely prefer the US were not so adversarial. At the same time, the country and its leaders are clear-eyed about what's happened and are laying out a plan for what's next, internationally and domestically. Holmes, from the Chamber of Commerce, says Canada has had a sort of \"it's the economy, stupid\" moment under Carney.\n\nPeter Morrow, an economist at the University of Toronto, says that Canada is doing better than was feared a year ago. \"There were a lot of concerns about dramatic levels of protectionism in the United States and all but complete collapses of manufacturing in Canada,\" he says. \"The realized tariffs have not been as dramatic as they might have been otherwise,\" he says. The effective tariff rate on Canadian goods coming into the US is still under 10%. Carney has a \"very good relationship with reality,\" Morrow says, and as much as economic nightmare scenarios haven't come to pass, the geopolitical outlook is worse than expected, given the instability of the NATO alliance and the deterioration of the global rules-based system that's been in place since World War II.\n\nMost of the economists and business people I spoke to for this story agreed that Canada coming into its own was a long time in the making. From Bush's \"you're with us or against us\" mentality post-9/11 to Obama's \"Buy America\" push to Biden's industrial policy, America has been acting like a less friendly friend for a while. Trump has taken it to an extreme, often failing to differentiate between international friend and foe. If it nudges Canada further out of America's shadow, the thinking goes, so be it. Carney's declaration that the global economy's middle powers need to band together and his suggestion that the US cannot be trusted is a sentiment he's not alone in — he's just saying it out loud.\n\n\"Carney is saying things that obviously encapsulate well how many, many countries, companies, and leaders are feeling, including many parts in many parts of the United States,\" Kelly says, adding that Carney's economic background and focus are also a plus. \"For a decade, anything economic was kind of issue number 500 on the Trudeau government's list of priorities. And now it seems very much like ensuring our economy is in high gear is the top job for the prime minister.\"\n\nOne of the main pieces of certainty Canada can have, at least in the immediate future, is that there's going to be a lot of uncertainty coming from the US. In many ways, America has become a threat actor and cause of decline. This has fostered a novel level of pro-Canadian sentiment within the country's borders and also boosted Carney's profile on the international and domestic stage — his approval rating jumped to 60% in a recent poll.\n\nThis is also landing at what's culturally a bright moment for Canada. Canada's men's hockey team is favored to win gold at the coming Winter Olympics, following up its victory in 2025's Four Nations tournament. Its women's team will likely be in contention for a medal as well. The gay hockey romance \"Heated Rivalry,\" out of Ontario, is everywhere. Tourists are turning up in Hamilton, Ontario, where the show is partially filmed, to check out some of the spots featured. The town is inviting them in.\n\n\"All these kinds of things to brand Canada's reputation as a welcoming place to everyone is not unhelpful,\" Kelly says. Especially as the US is moving in a different and much more unwelcoming direction.\n\nEmily Stewart is a senior correspondent at Business Insider, writing about business and the economy.",

Like many artists, she pays double rent — for her apartment and her studio — and her income swings dramatically, making it hard to budget.\n\nAt the same time, living in New York has turbocharged Kinnare's career. She's constantly meeting gallery owners, seeing new art, and getting exposure to new customers. But while her income has more than doubled in a few years, she often works seven days a week — and the money she makes doesn't go very far.\n\nKinnare is among a growing share of New Yorkers struggling to afford life in one of the most expensive cities in the world, as the costs of necessities like housing, groceries, and childcare soar. For decades, the city has failed to build enough new homes, creating a severe shortage that has driven up rents and home prices.\n\nNew York City's new mayor, Zohran Mamdani, got elected on a pledge to bring these costs down, including for artists. In January, he promised to \"make New York affordable to make the arts,\" and said his administration would also make arts and culture more accessible for working-class people. He's facing a dismal trend. After years of growth in the creative industries, the city has lost a significant number of artists since the pandemic.\n\n\"I've always been able to figure it out,\" Kinnare said, but, \"every month I'm like, 'Okay, how am I making money this month?'\"\n\nWhen she first arrived in the city, Kinnare spent $2,000 on rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood of Brooklyn that she also used as her art studio. Eventually, she moved in with two roommates and rented a separate studio, where she had more room to grow her craft.\n\nLast year, she moved in with her partner, and spends about $1,000 a month for her share of the $2,600 rent for their Bed-Stuy loft, and another $1,700 on her studio space in Dumbo.\n\nOver the last few years, she's steadily grown her art sales and income, which started around $50,000 a year when she first moved to the city, and last year exceeded $100,000. That's in part because one of her products — a $45 purse hook — took off late last year. She quickly sold out of her first 1,500 hooks, made of metal, glass, abalone shell, and mother-of-pearl, and designed to hang a bag from a restaurant table or bar. She recently dropped 2,000 more and hopes to make them a permanent part of her collection.\n\nDespite her recent windfall, budgeting is tricky with an income that varies dramatically month to month. \"I don't have family money to fall back on, or anyone to ask to borrow money from,\" she says.\n\nIt's taken a toll on Kinnare's social life, especially with friends who work corporate jobs and like to go out. She says she skips dinners out and has made a concerted effort to surround herself with other artists who understand the reality of having an unreliable income and the lifestyle that comes with it.\n\n\"Sometimes you blink your eyes and spend $100, and you're like, what just happened?\" she says. \"That's taken a lot of self-control to be able to find activities and things to do that don't require spending money.\"\n\nWhen factoring in the cost of living, New York creative workers like Kinnare earn about 23% less than the national average, a recent report by the nonprofit Center for an Urban Future found. A decade ago, they earned 15% less than the average. Much of that has to do with pricier real estate. With tighter living quarters in the city, many artists rent a separate studio space to work on their craft.\n\nFinding a studio space with enough room and natural light was even harder than finding an apartment, Kinnare says. When she was forced to move out of one studio on short notice, she struggled to find anything affordable on the market that had a window. So she resorted to messaging artists she didn't know on Instagram, asking for their landlords' contact information. \"It's a really, really fast game, and you have to be on top of it,\" she said.\n\nKinnare sees the high cost of living in New York City as an investment in her career that, so far, is paying off. She thinks it's easier to break into the art world than it was in LA, where she felt more professionally isolated.\n\n\"The art scene here is a lot more diverse and approachable,\" she said. \"I'm frequenting galleries a lot more, going to openings, going to shows, being in places where I want to be, networking and seeing and having the chance to talk to some of these people.\"\n\n\"The exposure here has been tenfold compared to what I've been used to,\" she added.\n\nLast year, she signed with a gallery after meeting their owners at a design fair and has since shown her work at multiple fairs with them.\n\nStill, the costs of breaking into the most dynamic creative scene in the country are high — and a growing number of creatives aren't making it. Many artists who left New York when COVID hit haven't returned. The number of New Yorkers working in the creative economy, including self-employed people, has dropped by about 6% since 2019, the Center for an Urban Future found. The city has lost nearly one-fifth of its dancers and film and video editors. More than a quarter of its fashion designers have disappeared.\n\nKinnare feels like one of the lucky ones. Her sales and social media following are growing, and she finally has some savings. One of her goals for 2026 is to give herself one day a week when she doesn't open her laptop or step inside the studio.\n\n\"I feel like I'm finally, after four years, at a place where I can breathe a little bit, but the grind never stops,\" she says. \"You can never get too comfortable.\"",

    "title": "All the ways Elon Musk's companies are already intertwined, from a Tesla 'collab' with SpaceX to Grok in vehicles",
    "description": "The five companies led by Elon Musk have increasingly become intertwined, even before Tesla's $2 billion investment in xAI or merger chatter.",
    "fullText": "Elon Musk is running some of the world's most valuable companies. But they've been doing business with each other long before recent merger chatter around Elon Inc.\n\nThe billionaire leads five major companies: Tesla, SpaceX, Boring Company, Neuralink, and xAI, which recently absorbed his social media company, X.\n\nOver the last three years, those companies have stepped up their internal dealings, buying one another's products, exchanging software and materials, and announcing investments worth billions of dollars.\n\nThe result is a tightly knit corporate ecosystem with Musk at its center.\n\nFor consumers and Tesla's many fans, that kind of vertical integration can look like a strength. Musk has argued that closer ties between his companies make them more resilient to geopolitical risk and supply-chain shocks.\n\n\"Done correctly, inter-company connections make a lot of sense,\" Lou Whiteman, a contributing analyst at The Motley Fool, told Business Insider. \"The important thing is to ensure good governance is in place, so that, for example, Boring is paying a fair price for Tesla vehicles.\"\n\nOther analysts and investors say the arrangement concentrates too much power in Musk's hands. Tesla's eight-member board includes longtime allies of the billionaire — including his brother.\n\nNone of Musk's companies responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nHere are some of the recent sharing agreements, purchases, and investments between Musk's companies:\n\nMusk has repeatedly drawn on employees from one company to support others in his portfolio.\n\nIn 2022, about a month after Musk bought Twitter — now known as X — he sent roughly 50 Tesla employees to the social-media company's headquarters to help overhaul its code-review systems, according to court filings.\n\nMusk later argued in court that the Tesla employees had \"volunteered\" to do the work and that their temporary reassignment should not concern Tesla's board.\n\nExecutives share overlapping functions on several of Musk's companies, too, according to insider org charts obtained by Business Insider.\n\nFor example, Charlie Kuehmann, the vice president of materials and engineering at Tesla, also holds the same title at SpaceX.\n\nSpaceX is a major customer of Tesla's energy business, purchasing batteries for robotics power and Megapack energy-storage systems.\n\nIt also reportedly invested $2 billion into xAI as a part of a previous funding round.\n\nMusk has also said that Tesla's long-awaited next-generation Roadster will be a \"Tesla/SpaceX collab\" and feature SpaceX-built cold-gas thrusters. The hyper-powered sports car's launch event is penciled in for April 1.\n\n\"It's gonna be really cool, and it's gonna have some rocket technology in it,\" Musk also said during a 2024 sit-down with Don Lemon.\n\nPerhaps the most public example of Musk's companies coordinating is Tesla's vehicle sales to his tunnel-building start-up.\n\nThe Boring Company, which operates tunnels in Las Vegas and Texas, uses fleets of Tesla vehicles to transport passengers through its underground systems. The tunnel builder has also constructed tunnels around Tesla's Gigafactory in Austin, Texas.\n\nIt isn't alone. SpaceX also purchased an unspecified number of Musk's Cybertrucks.\n\nTesla's earnings on Wednesday disclosed that it had agree to invest $2 billion in xAI, Musk's artificial intelligence startup, with a related \"framework agreement\" to explore additional collaboration opportunities.\n\nTesla has already integrated xAI's Grok into its vehicles, allowing drivers to chat with the AI and use it to add and edit navigation destinations.\n\nVideos have shown early versions of Tesla's in-development Optimus robot using xAI's Grok AI chatbot for its voice.\n\nElon’s Tesla Optimus 🤖🔥 is here! Dawn of the physical Agentforce revolution, tackling human work for $200K–$500K. Productivity game-changer! Congrats @elonmusk, and thank you for always being so kind to me! 🚀 #Tesla #Optimus pic.twitter.com/bA5IYIylE1\n\nxAI has also reportedly told investors that it's working on AI that could power Tesla's forthcoming Optimus humanoid robots.\n\nTesla executives said the $2 billion investment supports the automaker's push into self-driving technology. For example, the earnings deck explained that xAI-developed software will analyze vehicle interiors and assist with route planning, including adding high-occupancy-vehicle lanes when the car is full.\n\nFor xAI, the investment adds capital to the cash-hungry buildout of data centers and their energy needs.\n\nThe deal marked one of the clearest examples of capital flowing from Musk's public company into a privately held firm he controls.\n\nThe growing web of internal deals has fueled discussion among investors and analysts about whether Musk's companies are evolving into something closer to a single, vertically integrated enterprise.\n\nThere's also been recent reports that some of Musk's companies could merge — including potential combinations of Tesla and xAI or SpaceX and xAI.\n\nWhiteman said many Tesla investors appear comfortable with that direction.\n\n\"In Tesla's case, an important factor to consider is that investors are buying into Elon Musk's vision for the future as much as they are buying into an automaker or clean energy company,\" he said.\n\n\"Since this group of companies, public and private, combine to represent Elon Musk's full vision of the future, I'd bet that many investors are happy to see Tesla involved in all aspects of 'Elon Inc.'\"",

    "title": "The Safer Bowl: With tensions running high, Super Bowl advertisers avoid politics and play for laughs",
    "description": "This year's Super Bowl advertising formula is comedy plus celebrity for many brands taking part in the big game's commercial breaks.",
    "fullText": "In a charged political climate where even small missteps can spark a brand backlash, many of this year's Super Bowl advertisers are sticking with the safest bet in the playbook: comedy and celebrities.\n\nMuch like last year's Super Bowl, the vast majority of the big game ads released so far are playing it safe. Advertisers hope that A-list stars will be a shortcut to attention in the crowded field of commercials, and that humor will leave audiences feeling uplifted and warm toward their brand.\n\n\"In general, advertisers want to play it safe,\" said Peter Daboll, head of North America at the creative testing platform DAIVID. \"There's a high anxiety level here in the US, and people are probably very afraid of triggering anything.\"\n\nViewers aren't in the mood to be preached to, he added, and even heartwarming ads that might have performed well in Super Bowls past could come across as too \"syrupy\" and fall flat.\n\nThere's one week to go until the Patriots-Seahawks showdown, but plenty of brands have already released their ads, or teasers, ahead of game day.\n\nOf the 15 Super Bowl LX ad previews the TV measurement platform iSpot tested with a consumer panel so far, 12 triggered \"funny\" reactions from viewers. The highest \"funny\" score went to Instacart, whose vintage-style ad features actor Ben Stiller and singer Benson Boone in a high-energy— and ultimately calamitous — musical performance about choosing the perfect banana.\n\nOther ads hoping to raise a chuckle:\n\nThe cast of celebrities in the commercial breaks will range from Sabrina Carpenter for Pringles to Emma Stone for Squarespace and Guy Fieri for Bosch.\n\nMark Gross, cofounder of the ad agency Highdive, which has produced several Super Bowl campaigns over the years, said the Hollywood landscape had changed and that celebrities are now more open to appearing in commercials than in previous years.\n\n\"It's the job of us at ad agencies and marketers to tell great, original stories that stand out without just hiring the celebrity first and expecting that to do the work for you,\" he added.\n\nHighdive worked on a Super Bowl commercial for Lay's this year.\n\nThe Super Bowl remains one of the last mass-reach media advertising destinations. Last year's Super Bowl averaged a record-high US audience of 127.7 million viewers, per Nielsen, the TV ratings company.\n\nThe average price for 30 seconds of airtime during Super Bowl LX was $8 million, with some spots selling for more than $10 million, according to this year's big game broadcaster, NBCUniversal. Then there are the millions of dollars spent on talent fees, production, and media buys to amplify the ad after the game ends.\n\n\"CMOs are under so much pressure,\" said Kerry Benson, SVP of creative strategy at the data and analytics company Kantar.\n\n\"They have to prove ROI in these ads,\" she said, referring to return on investment.\n\nThe rewards can be handsome if brands play their Super Bowl strategies right.\n\nIn 2024, Kantar found that Super Bowl ads delivered an average return on investment of $8.60 for every $1 spent, making them 20 times more effective than regular TV ads. Benson said this reflects the size of the audience during the game and all the supporting activity and discussion around a Super Bowl campaign.\n\nNot every brand is adopting the comedy-and-celebrity playbook.\n\nToyota's \"Superhero Belt\" ad attempts to tug at the heartstrings, telling the story of a grandfather taking his grandson for a drive and showing their roles reversed decades later. Elsewhere, Hims & Hers' \"Rich People Live Longer\" spot strikes a provocative tone about US healthcare inequality, featuring a couple of characters that resemble Jeff Bezos and the biohacker Bryan Johnson.\n\n\"When you are challenging a system that has been broken for generations, the work cannot feel familiar or safe,\" said Hims & Hers chief design officer, Dan Kenger. \"The creative has to feel disruptive because that's what is needed to change the status quo of healthcare.\"\n\nAnselmo Ramos, creative chairman at the advertising agency GUT, is nostalgic for ads that didn't lean on celebrity as a shortcut to success — Apple's \"1984,\" Budweiser's frogs, the Geico caveman, and the E-Trade baby. He's also hoping to see more bold, anthemic spots in the sea of comedic commercials.\n\n\"I'm missing executions with a brand purpose, with a clear point of view,\" Ramos said. \"We need them more than ever.\"",

    "description": "\"It used to be common advice to figure out what you're good at, focus on that, and outsource everything else. We think that's bad advice.\"",
    "fullText": "Mike and Rob Barnes were just 19 and 22 when they founded Selkirk Sport, a pickleball equipment brand, in 2014.\n\nThe brothers had no college degrees, no outside investors, and no guarantee that pickleball, which was widely seen as a niche sport for seniors at the time, would ever catch on.\n\nBut they were hooked on the game, played on what resembles a miniature tennis court with a paddle roughly 16 inches long and a perforated plastic ball.\n\nThe unique thing about pickleball, invented on Bainbridge Island in 1965 by three dads looking to entertain their families, is its low barrier to entry.\n\n\"You can teach someone within an hour, and they'll have fun. Versus a game like tennis, where you have to put in a ton of hours to learn,\" Rob told Business Insider from the Selkirk HQ in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, where he, Mike, and their younger brother Tom were homeschooled and encouraged to pursue entrepreneurial projects. Mike and Rob started their first business in 2009, selling airsoft equipment and supplies.\n\n\"I remember there was a point where dad talked to us and said, 'OK, you can go to college, and you can go down that path, or you can keep doing what you're doing and just double down' — and we were like, let's double down, see what happens,\" recalled Rob.\n\nIt paid off in a big way. The family-run company, which Tom joined after a career in the Marines, is a leading pickleball brand known for its premium paddles, which have been the hero product since day 1. The brothers expect to generate at least $100 million in revenue in 2026 and have expanded to more than 200 employees.\n\n\"We're definitely big believers in education,\" Mike chimed in. \"It just doesn't necessarily have to be traditional education.\"\n\nLike their schooling, the way they operate their business is unconventional. Here are two business rules they live by.\n\nThe Barnes brothers don't believe there's a \"right\" or \"wrong\" way to go about business.\n\n\"In a formal education environment, you often learn there's one way of doing things — and your goal is to avoid making a mistake,\" said Mike. \"That creates a mindset where people are just trying to learn the best practice so they don't mess up. Our mindset is more like, let's look at all the different ways people have done things and decide what actually makes sense for us.\"\n\nInstead of defaulting to industry norms, they focus on \"strategic practices\" that are grounded in evidence, context, and their specific business goals.\n\n\"'Best practice' is almost a bad word in our company,\" Mike said. \"If someone says, 'Let's do this because it's the best practice,' you actually have to bring in evidence and explain why it's 'best.'\"\n\nKeep in mind that \"no one's built a great business by doing everything exactly the same way everyone else does,\" added Rob. \"Be willing to be counterintuitive and challenge the status quo.\"\n\nFrom the beginning, Selkirk has embraced vertical integration.\n\n\"It used to be common advice to figure out what you're good at, focus on that, and outsource everything else,\" said Mike. \"We think that's bad advice, so we do pretty much the opposite. If something creates value for the customer, we try to do it in-house.\"\n\nThat includes research and development, which many competitors outsource to manufacturers. Selkirk has the only private sports science lab in pickleball, which they've invested roughly $1 million into.\n\nTheir hands-on approach requires a tolerance for mistakes.\n\n\"You have to be willing to move and make decisions knowing you're going to mess some things up,\" said Rob. \"Our dad always said, 'If you're never breaking dishes, it means you're not doing anything.'\"\n\nHe pointed to Theodore Roosevelt's famous \"Man in the Arena\" speech, which he has framed and acts as a guiding philosophy. The message, he said, is that criticism is inevitable when you're actually doing something.\n\n\"The synopsis is, everybody can judge the man in the arena who has blood and sweat on him. If you're doing anything meaningful, people are going to judge you constantly, so you might as well get in there, try to make a difference, and accept that mistakes are part of the process.\"",

    "description": "Nadya Grisczenkow struggled to find a job after college so she became a full-time nanny.   It brought her balance, happiness, and a solid paycheck.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Nadya Grisczenkow, a 25-year-old nanny based in Boston. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nEveryone says you go to college, work hard, and you'll get a good job, and that just wasn't happening for me.\n\nI started applying to jobs, mostly social media and creative roles, during my senior year at Monclair State University in the spring of 2024. I felt defeated as graduation approached, and I didn't have any job offers from traditional applications or the PR firm I was interning at. I remember thinking, \"I feel like I'm doing all the right things.\"\n\nMy favorite quote of all time is \"what you're not changing, you're choosing,\" so I decided to pivot for the summer. I moved back in with my parents and siblings, hopped on a website for care providers and people searching for care to find a part-time nanny job, and became dead set on finding a full-time 9-to-5 by the fall.\n\nThat summer changed the trajectory of my life. Now I'm a full-time nanny, and I don't see myself going back. I made up to $1,600 weekly with the first family that hired me.\n\nI got hired as a part-time nanny for an amazing family, a husband, a very pregnant wife, and their toddler, but I saw it as an in-between before finding a corporate job.\n\nAs a new grad, navigating the job market was so overwhelming — there was a constant struggle to get my name to the top of the pile of applications. I kept getting my hopes up only to be let down, and the rejections took a toll on me. It got to a point where I really didn't know what I was doing wrong, but I felt like finding a traditional job was the only option.\n\nIt felt like everyone, even my sisters, we're saying things like \"Well, you can't just nanny,\" and it made me feel invalidated. As the oldest of five siblings, I felt a lot of internal pressure to set a good example for them.\n\nA few months later, my nanny family offered me a lucrative, full-time nanny position for their second child. I hadn't received any other job offers, and this position allowed me to work with a family I loved and spend more time with my sisters.\n\nThere was no reason to even think about turning it down, but I kept telling myself I needed to get out of nannying to feel fulfilled or make the people in my life proud. I feel like so many people don't see nannying as a legitimate position.\n\nIt also felt like I'd be disappointing myself because I had put so much pressure on myself to find a 9-to-5 job in the field I graduated in. We're ingrained to believe we should pursue a typical corporate job, but I had a gut feeling that wasn't the path for me.\n\nI realized this is my life, and I enjoy nannying, so I took the job.\n\nAfter accepting the full-time offer, I worried I might get \"stuck\" nannying or that I'd feel like the odd one out among my friends because I'm changing diapers all day instead of having meetings. When I started working with a wonderful family and making $30 an hour, those fears melted away.\n\nI really lucked out with my nanny family, because the mom, Hannah, and I became a true dynamic duo. We would take the kids everywhere together while her husband worked from home. She is now my best friend.\n\nThere were times I felt burned out from being around kids all day — it's certainly not for the weak — but I was so happy and enjoyed supporting their family. I'm now living in Boston, working for a new family with three kids, and travel-nannying on the side.\n\nI feel like when we're thinking about our careers, we're taught to figure out our natural skillset and how we can use it to get to the next level. As the oldest sibling, I've always been the nurturing, type A person who's used to managing chaotic energy. I enjoy feeling helpful and supportive.\n\nI thought back to my PR internship and realized that I sat at my cubicle and never felt truly useful. I was an intern, so of course I was doing bottom-of-the-barrel admin tasks, but I didn't feel like I was being used to the best of my abilities.\n\nAs a nanny, I feel so validated, seen, and fulfilled when I'm able to use my skillset to support my nanny family. Not everyone will understand nannying as a career choice, but I feel like I'm finally using my skills in the best way possible.\n\nI feel like I always put so much pressure on myself to have my next steps figured out, but I don't see any reason to shift out of nannying for a traditional 9-to-5. This version of my life makes me feel happy.\n\nOnce I learned to free myself from expectation, I realized that no matter what path I choose, I'll be successful if I feel fulfilled.\n\nMy current version of success means working a lot, maintaining a balanced life, supporting an amazing family, and making a lot of money. I shifted from wanting to be a successful corporate worker to feeling really confident in my choice as a nanny.\n\nDo you have a story to share about taking an unconventional career path?

    "description": "Palantir is a darling of the Reddit day-trader crowd. One everyday investor unpacks why he isn't buying the hype.",
    "fullText": "It's well known that retail traders love the meme culture of Wall Street Bets, but Reddit has become a fertile ground for genuine stock-market debate in the years since Roaring Kitty sparked the great GameStop short-squeeze.\n\nEvery so often, a well-argued thesis on a particular stock stands out. Of course, there's Keith Gill's famous posts unpacking why GameStop would soar. More recently, in October, a post from a retail trader disclosing a massive bet on struggling Beyond Meat blew up and quickly led to a major short squeeze.\n\nThis week, in a forum dedicated to \"The Big Short\" investor Michael Burry, one user posted their reasoning for betting against one of retail's favorite stocks: Palantir Technologies.\n\nPalantir stock is down 17% year to date, though it is still up 83% in the last year. Laurence Bradingmunn (u/Gerbil12345) thinks there's no reason shares should be as high as they are.\n\nBradingmunn spoke to Business Insider about his bearish take on Palantir, noting that Burry's short position inspired him to bet against the stock. Like Burry, he sees the company as highly overvalued but also has concerns about the broader AI space.\n\n\"I'm going shoulder to shoulder with Michael Burry on his thesis that the AI bubble is about to burst—specifically focusing on Palantir's extreme overvaluation and how the AI bubble (Government) has managed to shoot their stock to the moon,\" Bradingmunn wrote.\n\nThe 20-year-old Bradingmunn doesn't work in finance, but he told Business Insider that he's been following Burry for years. And while he isn't technically shorting Palantir but buying put options against it with strike prices in 2027 and 2028, similar to Burry, he maintains that the stock is pointed down.\n\nBradingmunn provided further context on the stock, laying out why he finds Palantir's $350 billion market cap concerning. He compared it to several other prominent tech stocks that he thinks Wall Street is valuing much more realistically.\n\n\"If you compare it to the companies with similar market caps, like AMD, Salesforce, Adobe, and you look at their actual profits, it's a stark contrast,\" he said. \"I don't believe [Palantir] can grow quick enough to meet the current valuation.\"\n\nThe retail trader said that he found it unusually difficult to learn what Palantir actually does to make money, another factor that's fed his bearish thesis. However, he added that he's equally concerned by Palantir's status as a stock highly dedicated cult following.\n\nPalantir stock is a well known favorite among retail investors, who have shown a deep admiration for CEO Alex Karp. Yet Bradingmunn speculated that many retail traders aren't taking time to assess the company's fundamentals.\n\n\"It can be very easy to follow someone's Reddit post talking about how great a stock is, and just fall for that,\" he acknowledged. \"I'm trying to take a more constructive thesis and to try and look at the actual numbers of all these stocks and see how I can have a different side of the story.\"\n\nBradingmunn acknowledges that the company may benefit from lucrative defense contracts with the US government, but he also sees significant risk from the company's share dilution. As of late 2025, it had roughly 2.38 billion shares outstanding, a major spike from the 1 billion when it first listed on the New York Stock Exchange.\n\nBradingmunn thinks investors should be concerned by this. \"I believe it should be worth about $50 per share.\" The stock closed on Friday at $146.59.",

    "fullText": "In a world of incessant distractions and pings, it can feel harder than ever to stay locked in on one task.\n\nThree executives from Slack, EY, and Superhuman shared how they reset to make room for deep thinking amid stacked calendars.\n\nThe common theme: Whether they're putting their phones away or changing rooms, they all said that finding a way to physically disconnect from distractions helps them focus on the task at hand.\n\nSlack's chief technology officer, Parker Harris, said that when he needs to focus on a single task and remove distractions, he turns off the sound of his notifications \"completely off.\" The CTO said he also flips his phone over so he isn't tempted to look at it.\n\n\"I hate that knock sound or any other sound,\" Harris said about notifications in general.\n\nHarris said even outside those situations, he typically keeps his notifications on. However, he doesn't necessarily \"jump straight\" to addressing every individual message he receives, given he works in an \"interrupt-driven\" environment.\n\n\"We all need to find a way to concentrate,\" Harris said.\n\nEY's global chief innovation officer said if he has to do some \"really deep thinking,\" which may include pondering strategy or preparing for a presentation, he'll often go for a walk or run outdoors. Depa said he also likes playing soccer and coaches his son's sports teams. The executive said getting outside removes him from his computer and other devices, and allows him to \"just think.\"\n\nDepa said if he has too much back-to-back travel or too many interviews, his brain will \"get fried.\" He said having some kind of balance is key to preventing getting into that state.\n\n\"You need to have that rest,\" Depa said.\n\nShishir Mehrotra, the CEO of AI productivity suite Superhuman, said that \"changing physical locations is very helpful\" for resetting, and that people \"underestimate\" the benefit of going for a walk.\n\nMehrotra also said he tries to avoid certain \"fidgets,\" which he described as something people use when they need to \"erase\" their brain, or \"cleanse their palette.\"\n\n\"The fidget I try to avoid is social media,\" Mehrotra said. \"That's the one that is inescapable.\"\n\nInstead, he said he likes to pick \"brainy collaborative games,\" especially ones that he can play with family, like Scrabble or The New York Times' Crossplay.\n\nHe also likes listening to podcasts when he's in the car. He said he's especially into the show \"Acquired,\" which offers hours of retrospectives on famous companies, like LVMH and Google. He said if he's going to choose something to cleanse his palette, he would rather it be something healthier that doesn't feel like a complete waste of time.\n\n\"Pick good palate cleansers that you feel good about,\" Mehrotra said.",

    "fullText": "As apps and gadgets capitalise on loss of stigma, consumers are advised to look for evidence-based solutions\n\nFor any bodily function you want to measure these days there is a gadget – a wristband for step-counting, a watch to track your heart rate or a ring for measuring sleep.\n\nNow the march of wearable tech is coming to the aid of what some say is a long underserved market: menopausal women.\n\nOne startup has recently launched a high-end cooling bracelet that kicks into action during a menopausal hot flush. The device is one of a growing number of lifestyle products being launched in this area, which some experts say is growing as stigma around menopause recedes. Companies are developing everything from apps offering dietary advice to devices that track symptoms, hormones and body temperature.\n\nWhile some caution that a boom in the menopause market could mean brands with overhyped solutions cash in on women’s fears, there is no shortage of investors who see a technological solution to the problems brought on by middle age.\n\nThe global menopause market is projected to reach approximately $24bn (£19bn) by 2030 according to the San Francisco-based market research and consulting firm Grand View Research.\n\nLeading investors in menopause products include venture capital funds, corporate giants such as Bayer and Unilever Ventures, and retail partners such as Tesco.\n\nThe MyCelsius bracelet, a £229.99 cooling device, is worn on the wrist to instantly cool down wearers who experience hot flushes triggered by menopause. Its designers say it also alleviates the effects of hormonal changes such as stress, anxiety or other everyday factors on body temperature.\n\nSarah Garlick, 50, went into surgical menopause after having a hysterectomy and her ovaries removed at 43. She is on HRT but still experiences many other symptoms. She said she bought a range of products when it first happened, including a £60 nightie that promised to regulate her temperature at night.\n\nShe quickly lost hope that these kinds of products would work. However, when she was approached to take part in a trial of MyCelcius, she finally found something that helped.\n\nShe believes products like this are only now being marketed because the stigma around menopause has started to shift. “That’s the thing as well,” she said, noting that she shows off her wristband: “I’ve spoken [to other women] about it openly, like, ‘This is what I need, and this is what helps.’”\n\nMaxime Kryvian, co-founder of Celsius Innovations, which makes MyCelcius, said: “For a long time there has always been less investment in women’s health. But we’re seeing real improvements now, with more investment funds coming in. There’s also more institutional support, including organisations like the Gates Foundation. It’s definitely a growing area.”\n\nWith the rush of investment has come inevitable scrutiny. A recent study by University College London, led by Prof Joyce Harper, warned of a “menopause gold rush”, with unregulated companies exploiting a lack of reliable information. Researchers called for the rollout of a national education programme after finding a significant number of women do not feel well-informed about menopause.\n\nWriting in the medical journal Post Reproductive Health, they said: “There has been a rapid expansion in unregulated private companies and individuals providing menopause information and support for profit.”\n\nKryvian acknowledged that scepticism around new menopause products is often justified, pointing to the supplement market as an example.\n\n“Honestly, we’ve already seen this in areas like supplements,” he said. “It can be very hard to attribute the exact impact, and some of the scepticism around these new products is warranted. That’s why it’s so important that anything entering this space is backed by science and developed with the right experts.”\n\nHe said consumers should look carefully at who has developed a product and what evidence exists to support its claims. “My advice to consumers is to ask: how was this developed, and by whom? Is there data on its impact? What do customer reviews say?\n\n“Another thing to look at is what companies are willing to reimburse you if it doesn’t work … That’s often the best signal,” he added.\n\nNearly two in three women over 50 in the UK struggle with their mental health, relationship breakdowns and changes to their appearance as they deal with menopause, a survey has found.\n\nDr Claire Phipps, a menopause specialist at London Gynaecology, acknowledged the potential benefits of wearable tech but said consumers should remains cautious about looking for a Silicon Valley-designed magic bullet.\n\n“I wouldn’t advise anyone to rush out and buy anything. For those still having periods, tracking devices like Aura Rings or basic period trackers can be useful. And a simple handheld fan might actually be the best cooling solution. But I would be wary of anything marketed specifically as a ‘menopause relief’ product unless it’s backed by solid evidence.\n\n“The industry is booming, but there’s still a huge lack of randomised controlled trials. If a product hasn’t been properly tested, how do we know it works? It’s crucial to question the science behind every new device or supplement,” she added.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is the lack of reliable guidance. Unlike fertility, which is tightly regulated and evidence-based, menopause care has fewer safeguards. “Anyone can call themselves a menopause coach,” Phipps said. “It’s hard for women to know who to trust.”\n\nThe rush of new products reflects this uncertainty. As the “menopause economy” grows, so too does the misinformation, often spread by social media influencers. “The internet is full of exaggerated claims,” Phipps says. “It’s shameful how easily misinformation spreads. We need to focus on evidence-based solutions.”\n\nIn this environment, Phipps advocates for a more grounded approach to managing menopause. “Start with the basics: nutrition, self-care and stress management. Simple lifestyle changes can make a huge difference. If symptoms persist, that’s when to seek professional advice.”",

    "description": "In the final part of this series, we look at how infighting has ripped the left apart online while the right has flourished – and how some progressives are turning the...",
    "fullText": "There is politics before the internet, and politics after the internet. Liberals are floundering, the right are flourishing, and what of the left? Well, it’s in a dire state. This is despite the fact that the key political problems of the last decade – rising inequality and a cost of living crisis – are problems leftists claim they can solve. The trouble is, reactionaries and rightwingers steal their thunder online, quickly spreading messaging that blames scapegoats for structural problems. One reason for this is that platforms originally built to connect us with friends and followers now funnel us content designed to provoke emotional engagement.\n\nBack when Twitter was still the “town square” and Facebook a humble “social network”, progressives had an advantage: from the Arab spring to Occupy Wall Street, voices excluded from mainstream media and politics could leverage online social networks and turn them into real-life ones, which at their most potent became street-level protests that toppled regimes and held capitalism to account. It seemed as though the scattered masses would become a networked collective empowered to rise up against the powerful.\n\nBut the model of friending and following put a cap on engagement. It’s hard to remember now, but there was a time when you could reach the end of your Facebook and Instagram feeds – our friends only had so many lunches to post. Platforms needed to find ways to keep us logged in. Instagram introduced “suggested posts” from accounts users didn’t follow. TikTok took this logic further: just sign up and start swiping, no need to friend or follow anyone. Creators with small social networks could go viral just by posting engaging content, and everyone could lose themselves in an infinite stream of shortform videos. Copycats such as Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts crowded into this new market. Over on X, Elon Musk reinstated far-right accounts and turned the “for you” feed into a home for racism and hate speech.\n\nIn short, platforms that had once offered a space for debate and deliberation shifted toward emotion and immersion. Reactionaries and rightwingers have adapted their stories about who is to blame for the daily indignities of late capitalist life accordingly. Emotionally charged stories of elite villains and dangerous minorities resonate in algorithmically tailored spaces designed for doomscrolling through the permacrisis.\n\nMeanwhile, liberals were still focusing on old media platforms such as newspapers and broadcast debates, as well as follower-focused platforms such as Bluesky. The left remains committed to residual media forms, launching new print and online journals. It also does a delicate dance between appearing on traditional media outlets and critiquing them – but whether it likes it or not, it has a symbiotic relationship with the liberal media.\n\nTheir critiques are often excellent and politically consequential: Novara Media’s Ash Sarkar is the rare leftwing wit on televised panels, and Jacobin helped lay the groundwork for Zohran Mamdani’s campaign by offering a space to hash out democratic socialist ideas in a country where socialism is still a dirty word. But even Chapo Trap House, a key podcast from the US’s “dirtbag left” (a loose group of anti-capitalist and deliberately irreverent content creators) spends many a podcast roasting the New York Times. This may be cathartic, but it’s hardly a match for what we are seeing coming from the right.\n\nThe right has established its own parallel media universe. It eschews most real news and instead tells convincing tales about how the shadowy functionaries of the Cathedral, or the matrix, or cultural Marxism lie to you in the media and try to control your every action. The reactionary right is not just xenophobia, racism and misogyny. This online subculture also offers camaraderie, new diets, natural medicine, exercise regimes, all of which arrive in new communicative forms such as memes and live streams.\n\nInstead of building an alternative new media ecosystem and amplifying each other’s work, the left focuses more on competition than the right. As the right convenes the intellectual dark web and manosphere, leftwing digital media is a scattered landscape of Substacks and X-to-Bluesky hot-take artists. The demands of the attention economy exacerbate the age-old leftist tendency toward infighting – it’s not just moral purity at stake. The rent is also due.\n\nTake one of the more interesting creators on the left who releases work on YouTube, Natalie Wynn, known as ContraPoints. She has elevated her YouTube video essays to auteur status, combining cinematic lighting with French theory, camp dialogue and compelling political analysis. She is often put on a pedestal, only to be knocked down by others on the left. If you disagree with Wynn, you can say it’s because she sold out, and you might even be able to make your own “drama” YouTube video about it.\n\nOn top of that, the centre right is often happy to engage with ideas from the right, but liberals and the left actively balk at exchanging ideas. Take, for example, the tussle between the socialism of the left and the theory of “abundance” being forwarded by the centre in US Democratic circles at the moment. More time has been spent posting teardowns instead of focusing on the pretty big thing they have in common: state intervention in the economy. Like it or not, the “abundance” agenda has created an opening for progressive politics. The right would exploit this momentum. The left looks for flaws.\n\nStill, there are signs of life on the online left. The Irish comedian and “toxic spirit guide” Frankie McNamara has elevated the social media vox pop into a vehicle for deadpan takes on cultural types from “hot new dads” to “wellness warriors”. The Elephant Graveyard’s YouTube documentaries on the cult of Joe Rogan – in the style of Adam Curtis, but funny – have shown that disdain is a more powerful weapon against the manosphere than moral panic.\n\nThere are even signs that the posting-to-policy pipeline can work for the left. The Palestinian-American influencer Kat Abughazaleh is carrying the same arguments about Maga, ICE and the genocide in Gaza from TikTok into her surprise frontrunner congressional campaign. Win or lose, her campaign shows that the real power of online politics is about waging the fight over how people view the world – and what they see as politically possible. The online right has had its sights set on this fight for a decade. Now, many on the left are leaving internal battles behind and entering the fray.\n\nRobert Topinka is a reader in digital media and rhetoric at Birkbeck, University of London",

    "fullText": "App endured a major outage and user backlash over perceived censorship. Now it’s facing an inquiry by the California governor and an ascendant competitor\n\nA little more than one week ago, TikTok stepped on to US shores as a naturalized citizen. Ever since, the video app has been fighting for its life.\n\nTikTok’s calamitous emigration began on 22 January when its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, finalized a deal to sell the app to a group of US investors, among them the business software giant Oracle. The app’s time under Chinese ownership had been marked by a meteoric ascent to more than a billion users, which left incumbents such as Instagram looking like the next Myspace. But TikTok’s short new life in the US has been less than auspicious.\n\nThe day after TikTok’s arrival, its owners altered its privacy policy to permit more extensive data collection, including tracking the precise locations of its users. The change was notable less for any potential invasion of privacy than for suspicion of the new owners. The updated policy falls in line with those of other major social networks. But what did these men, among them billionaire Oracle owner and Maga donor Larry Ellison, intend to do with the user data? The tweaks aroused suspicion that would blossom into paranoia just a few days later.\n\nDuring the weekend that followed the transfer of TikTok’s ownership, the US weathered two major events. A hefty, frigid snowstorm slammed the country and put about 230 million people on alert for power outages and burst pipes. And federal immigration officers killed a 37-year-old US citizen in Minneapolis during a protest, which elicited outright lies from the White House despite copious video footage. Both would knock TikTok off its feet, though in different ways.\n\nWinter Storm Fern crippled multiple Oracle datacenters that TikTok relies on, which the company did not make public at the time. The app suffered severe outages as a result, according to a statement from the company. Many users said they were unable to upload videos. Others said their videos received zero views despite significant followings.\n\nSimultaneously, prominent personalities were attempting to use TikTok to express their outrage over the violent death of Alex Pretti at the hands and guns of border patrol agents. They found they could not post videos or that they received zero views. In response, many users – among them California state senator Scott Weiner, musician Billie Eilish and her brother, and comedian Meg Stalter – accused TikTok of stifling videos critical of federal immigration agents. Stalter said she would delete her account, which boasts nearly 280,000 followers. Media outlets far and wide – the New York Times, Variety, the Independent, CNN, the Washington Post – picked up their claims. Cosmopolitan magazine asked: “Is TikTok Censoring Anti-ICE Content?” The Democratic senator Chris Murphy, from Connecticut, tweeted that TikTok’s alleged censorship was a “threat to democracy”.\n\nAfter days of outcry online, IRL scrutiny and likely dozens of requests for clarification from the press, TikTok issued a statement blaming the problems on the snow, ice and cold on 26 January.\n\nOracle issued a statement with more detail: “Over the weekend, an Oracle datacenter experienced a temporary weather-related power outage which impacted TikTok. The challenges US TikTok users may be experiencing are the result of technical issues that followed the power outage.” It is uncommon for a physical event like a storm to wound a major site of digital life like TikTok, as such popular apps often have backups to their backups, but it can happen.\n\nThe most powerful figure to accuse TikTok of censorship was not its most famous user. The governor of California is better known for his textual presence on X than his TikToks. Nevertheless, Gavin Newsom announced on 27 January that his office would investigate whether TikTok had censored videos critical of Donald Trump, broadening the scope of alleged pro-Maga interference by the app.\n\nThe late attribution of blame did little to assuage public criticism. An unknown number of users said they were decamping from the new American TikTok in response to its perceived censorship. The exodus has propelled a new competitor, Upscrolled, which promises less censorship than TikTok, to the top spot in the US Apple App Store and the third spot in the Google Play Store. An Upscrolled press release now claims more than a million users. As of writing, TikTok rests at No 16 in the iPhone App Store and 10th in the Google Play Store. Alongside Upscrolled in the top 10 most downloaded are three apps used to cloak online activity from surveillance, which are known as virtual private networks (VPNs). A fear of digital government incursions is in the air.\n\nWith more than a billion users worldwide, it seems unlikely that TikTok will altogether vanish as a result of these failures. Facebook and Instagram have withstood far graver scandals than this. TikTok’s first week in the US does not bode well for its future, though. The app has damaged user trust, and another misstep may inflict a more lasting injury.\n\nTikTok’s week of mayhem began with Trump. The transfer of TikTok’s ownership consummated the ban-or-sell deal the US president proposed nearly six years ago, and he said he was thrilled that that the transfer had finally taken place. In the intervening years, Trump had walked back his support for the deal; his enemy Joe Biden had supported it during his presidency; Congress had passed a law codifying Trump’s wishes and legally forcing TikTok’s sale; and the US supreme court had ratified the law in the face of a challenge by TikTok and immense popular disapproval. Then Trump ordered the immigration crackdown that set the stage for the killing of two US citizens. The only aspect of TikTok’s miserable week Trump had no hand in was the winter weather.\n\nTikTok’s disastrous arrival marks an anniversary of a similar bungled nature. One year and two weeks ago, the app stopped functioning in the US because of the same sell-or-ban law that precipitated the sale. That darkening lasted less than 24 hours. Its new owners can only hope their present problems go away just as soon.",

When your boots break in the warm-up you have to make do,\" a modest Bell said on Premier Sports.\n\n\"I've got different colours on at the moment so I have to fix that. It wasn't planned.\n\n\"I'd like to say I know what I'm doing but I really don't. I don't really remember it, but it was good fun.\"",

    "fullText": "Rafaela Pimenta has never scored a goal or managed a team. But the 53-year-old is the only football entry in Forbes' '50 over 50' list for 2026.\n\nEvery January, the global media company publishes the 50 women who have reached a position of status and influence that makes them beacons for others to follow.\n\nOscar-winning actress Penelope Cruz is there, so too Dame Sarah Mullally - the first female Archbishop of Canterbury.\n\nAs football's first female super agent, Brazilian Pimenta is hugely influential.\n\nHer impressive stable of clients includes Manchester City striker Erling Haaland, Liverpool manager Arne Slot and 17-year-old Mexican wonderkid Gilberto Mora.\n\nShe radiates warmness as she arrives on time to speak exclusively to BBC Sport. Once the cameras are rolling, Pimenta is deadly serious as she covers a range of topics, including the treatment of women in football.\n\nBut, on the eve of deadline day, let's start with her concerns about the present transfer system.\n\n\"There needs to be a change,\" she explains. \"There's too much power for clubs.\n\n\"Players are sometimes hostages of situations. I'm not fighting for chaos. We need the transfer system for the whole thing to work. But we need more balance.\n\n\"We are in a transfer window, and I can bet you, because I see it at the end of every window, somebody will cry. There's always a player crying because he could have gone, needed to go and a club said they want £1m more.\"\n\nIn October 2024, the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) found rules implemented by world governing body Fifa, which govern the way some football transfers work, break European Union laws.\n\nFifa subsequently introduced an interim framework based on the calculation of compensation payable and burden of proof if there is a breach of contract.\n\n\"Football used to be more human,\" Pimenta adds. \"A football director or an owner would have a special relationship with the player. If a player went to them and said 'please, I need to go', they would find a solution.\n\n\"Today, football is becoming so much of a business there is a risk that players become an asset on the balance sheet. An asset has no voice, no feelings, no human needs.\n\n\"The challenge is to find a balance between the asset and the human being.\"",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Dmitry Medvedev, deputy chairman of Russia’s Security Council, praised U.S. President Donald Trump as an effective leader who was seeking peace but added that Moscow had seen no trace of nuclear submarines Trump said he moved to Russian shores.\n\nTrump, who has said he wants to be remembered as a \"peacemaker\" president, has repeatedly said that a peace deal to end the Ukraine war is close, and a new round of U.S.-Russian-Ukrainian talks is scheduled for this week in Abu Dhabi.\n\nAsked if Trump was positive or negative for Russia and about unproven speculation that Trump was some sort of Russian agent, Medvedev said the American people had chosen Trump and that Moscow respected that decision.\n\nMedvedev lauded Trump’s courage in resisting the U.S. establishment and said the U.S. president’s sometimes \"brash\" style was \"effective\".\n\n\"He is an emotional person, but on the other hand, the chaos that is commonly referred to, which is created by his activities, is not entirely true,\" he told Reuters, TASS and the WarGonzo Russian war blogger in an interview at his residence outside Moscow and authorised for publication on Sunday.\n\n\"It is obvious that behind this lies a completely conscious and competent line,\" said Medvedev, who served as Russian president from 2008 to 2012.\n\nPresident Vladimir Putin remains the final voice on Russian policy, though Medvedev, an arch-hawk who has repeatedly goaded Trump on social media, gives a sense of hardliners’ thinking within the Russian elite, according to foreign diplomats.\n\n\"Trump wants to go down in history as a peacemaker - and he is really trying,\" Medvedev said. \"He is really trying to do that. And that is why contacts with Americans have become much more productive.\"\n\nMedvedev said the key to understanding Trump was his business background, quipping that there was no such thing as a former businessman - a play on an old Russian joke that there is no such thing as a former KGB agent.\n\nTrump in August said he had ordered two U.S. nuclear submarines to move closer to Russia in response to what he called \"highly provocative\" comments from Medvedev about the risk of war after what appeared to be an ultimatum from Trump.\n\n\"We still have not found them,\" Medvedev said of the U.S. submarines.\n\nAfter Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, Medvedev has repeatedly hurled invective at Kyiv and Western powers while warning of the risks of an escalation of the war towards a nuclear \"apocalypse\".\n\nMedvedev said Russia would \"soon\" win military victory in the Ukraine war but the key thing was to prevent any further conflict, adding: \"I would like this to happen as soon as possible.\"\n\n\"But it is equally important to think about what will happen next. After all, the goal of victory is to prevent new conflicts. This is absolutely obvious.\"\n\nRussia currently controls a fifth of Ukraine but has so far been unable to take the whole of the eastern Donbas region, where Ukrainian forces hold about 10%, or 5,000 square km (1,900 square miles), according to open-source maps of the war.",

    "fullText": "PHOENIX — Phoenix Suns guard Dillon Brooks has never shied away from honesty, and on Saturday, he was candid when asked who he believed was the most overrated player in the NBA.\n\nDec 23, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) moves the ball against Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks in the first half at Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-Imagn Images\n\nBrooks was a guest on Twitch streamer N3on’s broadcast, as the duo drove around Phoenix and Brooks showed the streamer the Suns’ locker room and practice facility. At one point, N3on posed the question to Brooks, who answered without hesitation.\n\n“I would probably say Lebron [James] right now,” the Suns guard said. “I feel like he overrated right now, his time is coming to an end.”\n\nNeedless to say, the remark quickly went viral online. Within hours, Brooks’ honesty was met with a flurry of reactions from fans.\n\nThe comment marks another chapter in the rivalry Brooks and James have found themselves in this season. Both players have had their fair share of exchanges during games between the Suns and the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nThe most notable came in a Dec. 14 thriller, when the two spent much of the night jawing at each other before Brooks was ultimately ejected in the closing seconds after receiving his second technical foul following a confrontation with James after hitting a go-ahead 3-pointer.\n\nPhoenix would eventually fall to Los Angeles, 116-114.\n\nDec 1, 2025; Los Angeles, California, USA; Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) moves the ball against Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) during the first half at Crypto.com Arena. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-Imagn Images\n\nAs a defining figure in the league for more than two decades, James has been one of the most accomplished players in NBA history. However, Brooks’ comments suggest he views James strictly as an on-court rival, regardless of his accolades.\n\nThe moment also reinforces Brooks’ reputation as an unapologetic edge-setter for the Suns. His confrontational persona has resonated with the fan base and, while it has occasionally led to foul trouble, it has also helped fuel Phoenix to much-needed wins and momentum.\n\nDec 14, 2025; Phoenix, Arizona, USA; Phoenix Suns forward Dillon Brooks (3) and Los Angeles Lakers forward LeBron James (23) react during an altercation that resulted in a technical for Brooks during the second half of a game at the Mortgage Matchup Center. Mandatory Credit: Allan Henry-Imagn Images\n\nWhether the remark draws a response from James or lingers into future matchups between the Western Conference rivals, Brooks continues to find himself at the center of the NBA’s national conversation.\n\nArizona State welcomes back former stars for ASU vs Arizona basketball showdown",

    "fullText": "Mavericks coach Jason Kidd is growing frustrated with what he believes are missed foul calls against Cooper Flagg late in games.\n\nFlagg drove to the basket in the closing moments of Dallas’ loss to the Houston Rockets and did not receive a whistle. He remained on the floor looking toward the official, but no call was made.\n\nAfter the game, Kidd did not hold back.\n\n“I saw a foul. Sean (Wright), Simone (Jelks) & Jason (Goldberg) were awful tonight,” He said. “It’s unacceptable. It’s a foul & he needs to be at the free throw line. Does he make both? That’s up to the player.”\n\nLater in the postgame news conference, Kidd bristled at a question about the national criticism surrounding his point guard usage. Before the question could be fully asked about Flagg becoming a good ball handler, Kidd cut in sharply.\n\n“I don’t give a fuck about the criticism,” Kidd said. “That’s your opinion. You guys write that bullshit. I’ve done this. I’ve played this game. I’ve played it at a very high level & I know what the fuck I’m doing. But I don’t give a fuck what you guys write because you guys have never played the game. I have built players so I know what the fuck I’m doing. To take criticism, it only makes me better because if I wasn’t doing it right, you guys wouldn’t be poking holes at what I’ve done.”\n\nJason Kidd was asked by @RonKnowsSports about the national criticism for playing Cooper Flagg at point guard.\n\nKidd: \"Criticism? That’s your opinion. You guys write that bullshit. That’s not — I’ve done this. I’ve played this game. I played it. I know what the fuck I’m doing.\n\n\"I… pic.twitter.com/NovR3R0PTV\n\n— Grant Afseth (@GrantAfseth) February 1, 2026\n\nKidd has been repeatedly asked throughout the season about playing Flagg at point guard earlier in his career, and the line of questioning appeared to wear thin. National criticism of Kidd’s decisions has followed him throughout the season, adding to the tension.\n\nHere are two thoughts from the 111-107 loss on Saturday:\n\nWith under two minutes remaining, Flagg converted a layup to cut Houston’s lead to two points. His big night, however, was not enough. Alperen Sengun answered with a floater to help lift the Rockets past the Mavericks.\n\nWith a loss, the Rockets tied their series with the Mavericks at two games a piece. Two of the four games were within nine points. The Mavericks have lost four games in a row.\n\nWith the Dallas Mavericks trailing in the fourth quarter, Flagg went into attack mode.\n\nThe 6-foot-9 forward bullied his way into the lane on back-to-back possessions, resulting in two baskets. Both times, he ended up on the ground looking for a foul call. On the third possession, Flagg rose over Houston Rockets guard Josh Okogie and knocked down a midrange jumper while drawing a foul.\n\nFlagg is coming off a teenage-record 49-point performance in Dallas’ previous game against the Charlotte Hornets. Houston countered by throwing its top wing defenders,  a group that has helped the Rockets post the sixth defensive rating in the NBA,  at Flagg. Still, neither Amen Thompson, Jabari Smith Jr. nor Tari Eason could keep the former Duke forward from getting to his spots.\n\nFlagg finished with 34 points, 12 rebounds and five assists in the loss. He became the first teenager in NBA history to record consecutive 30-point double-doubles, according to ESPN. Flagg also joined LeBron James and Luka Dončić as the only teenagers with consecutive 25-point double-doubles.\n\nSengun, who entered the night averaging 21.1 points and 9.1 rebounds, missed a floater that rolled off the rim, then was called for an over-the-back foul while attempting to secure the offensive rebound. He shook his head as he ran back on defense.\n\nSengun finished with 14 points and 14 rebounds on 6-of-20 shooting (30 percent). Dallas center Daniel Gafford helped make things difficult for the Rockets’ big man at Toyota Center.\n\nGafford turned in one of his stronger performances of the season, finishing with 16 points and 11 rebounds. He has played through a sprained ankle suffered within the first 10 minutes of the team’s opening training camp practice.\n\nBrandon Williams knocked down two 3-pointers in the first quarter and scored 13 points in the period, but his night was cut short when Rockets guard Reed Sheppard collided with his knees while diving for a loose ball. Williams did not return because of a left knee contusion. It marked the second straight game in which Williams left with an injury.\n\nDallas struggled to contain Rockets forward Jabari Smith Jr., who finished with 19 points and eight rebounds. The Mavericks focused their defensive attention on Kevin Durant and Sengun, leaving Smith open on multiple possessions. On the other end, Smith was a defensive presence, blocking three shots and limiting Mavericks wing Naji Marshall, who scored eight points.",

    "fullText": "In the 2025 off-season, many were talking about shipping Joel Embiid off from the 76ers, but his resurgence has shut most of those critics up. He’s beginning to show his MVP-esque self and his teammates can only watch on in awe.\n\nEmbiid struggled with a plethora of injury issues over the last few years, particularly in this knee. There were fears surrounding his overall athleticism, with some even claiming that he was considering retirement. Embiid, however, believed in himself to return strong, as did Tyrese Maxey, who recently admitted that it was a “blessing” to have this version of Embiid back.\n\nAgainst the New Orleans Pelicans earlier today, Embiid scored 40 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. He was the star performer and took Philly to 27-21, just two games behind the Cleveland Cavaliers in No. 5 in the East. Maxey, in the post-game presser, began by simply stating that Embiid “is really good at basketball.”\n\nIt was an obvious statement, but Maxey then explained, “He’s playing the right way. He’s getting people involved, roll in. I think the biggest thing right now is his trust level in his teammates.”\n\nMaxey, who had just 18 points on the night, noted how even late into the game, Embiid was observant, and whenever there was a mismatch, he would look for others around to keep the scoreboard ticking. It’s a sign that he’s getting back into the rhythm, shaking the rust off.\n\nNo one knows what Embiid went through better than his teammates in Philly, and Maxey, who has blossomed into an All-Star-level player emerging from the shadows, is just happy that everything is falling into place. “It’s a blessing,” he said.\n\n“He works hard, he done a good job of getting his body right. He played more minutes than I tonight, so that’s good,” Maxey added, after realizing that Embiid played 40 minutes against New Orleans, five more than him.\n\nComing into tonight’s game, since December 12th, Joel’s been averaging 29.4 points, 8.3 rebounds, and boasting a 63 TS%.\n\nThe 76ers, of course, are still some distance away from calling themselves true contenders. But the team looks to be headed in the right direction, and for that, Embiid’s revival was of vital importance.\n\nThe post Tyrese Maxey Says “It’s a Blessing” to Have All-Star Joel Embiid Back After Injury Ordeal appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "description": "Atlanta Braves news and notes from Saturday",
    "fullText": "The offseason may almost be over, but the Braves have widely been rumored to still be looking to add a starting pitcher and there are plenty left on the open market, as well as some presumably available via trade. The biggest fish in free agency is Framber Valdez and there has been some buzz about him and the Braves for months now. This connection was reaffirmed on Saturday by Mark Feinsand. Valdez is a good pitcher getting into his mid-30s and would cost a draft pick to sign. Perhaps his availability this late into the offseason could result in a bit more team friendly of a deal, combined with those other factors, making it a more palatable signing for this front office. If not, there are plenty of other options available.\n\nMLB.com’s Mark Feinsand listed the Braves as a potential suitor for the top remaining free agent, Framber Valdez.\n\nThe Braves hosted some player panels, featuring the team’s Rookie of the Year winners, star pitchers, and infielders.\n\nThe Giants signed contact savant Luis Arraez to a one year deal to play second base for the club.\n\nThe White Sox signed outfielder Austin Hays to a one year guaranteed deal with a mutual option for a second year.\n\nSome quirks with insurance rules for players playing in the WBC are impacting which players can play and how they can be used, warranting some forward-facing scrutiny.",

Many wondered why this was happening at the time, but it has become pretty clear to me now why this happened – they wanted to use him to cover Sarr coming back to Chelsea, not leaving their sister club short at the back for the rest of the season.\n\nAaron Anselmino makes his debut.\n\nLast night, Romano posted on X:\n\n‘RC Strasbourg now clear favorites to sign Aaron Anselmino on loan from Chelsea!\n\n‘Zero chances for return to Borussia Dortmund after comments about club keen to buy him. ❌\n\n‘#CFC didn’t like that + seen as future Chelsea player.\n\n‘Bid rejected from PL club as well.’\n\nLets hope Anselmino can continue his development over in France now, because he looks like a real talent.\n\nAuxerre want to sign Chelsea striker David Datro Fofana with discussions taking place over a loan with an option to buy according to reports.

Ruben Dias, Josko Gvardiol, John Stones, Mateo Kovacic, Jeremy Doku and Savinho are all ruled out of today’s match. Pep Lijnders revealed that Doku is set to be ruled out for between two-three weeks due to the calf injury he sustained in City’s win over Galatasaray. Lijnders also revealed that Ruben Dias is set to return to training on Monday. Today’s match comes too soon for Manchester City’s defensive leader but his return from a hamstring injury is imminent.\n\nManchester City will be boosted by the returns of Rodri, Marc Guehi, and Antoine Semenyo.

    "fullText": "Alexander Volkanovski did the double over Diego Lopes on Saturday, securing a points win over his challenger in the main event of UFC 325.\n\nThe victory came nine months after Volkanovski beat Lopes in the same manner, with Saturday’s result extending the Australian’s second reign as featherweight champion.\n\nThe win came on home soil for Volkanovski, too, as he secured scores of 49-46, 49-46 and 50-45 in Sydney. In fact, those scores saw the 37-year-old better his first performance against Lopes, whom he outpointed 49-46, 49-46, 48-47 in April.\n\nVolkanovski’s first fight with Lopes was for the vacant featherweight title, which Ilia Topuria had relinquished one year after knocking out Volkanovski. And the Aussie had not fought since reclaiming the gold, while Lopes bounced back in September with a stunning knockout of Jean Silva.\n\nStill, few fans were particularly excited for Saturday’s rematch in Sydney, believing that even an ageing Volk could handle Lopes, 31, again. And that was the case, as “Alexander The Great” overcame the Brazilian for the second time with a well-rounded performance.\n\nVolkanovski out-struck Lopes at range, intermittently tagging the younger man with hard, timely counters, and survived a few precarious grappling exchanges. He even tried to take down Lopes sporadically, as he looked to exhibit nearly all of his tools as a fighter.\n\n“It ain’t getting any easier,” Volkanovski joked in the cage after winning. “Camp was a lot of things going on in there. We pushed through.\n\n“Sometimes things go wrong, but I’m like: ‘Let’s go, that’s more of a challenge.’ It fires me up even more. I didn’t want to stand for 25 minutes, I’ll be honest, but we got the job done so it’s all good.\n\n“We were ready for him to make the right adjustments. Our last fight, we moved to the right and we did a good job cutting that off straight away. I make the adjustments, that’s what makes a true champion.\n\n“You’ve got guys that are talented, they’ve got all this stuff. But it’s all the stuff: everyone that has the grit, the determination, hard work, sacrifice, [can] make the adjustments on the fly, stay composed in the fire. I’ve got them all.”\n\nIn the co-main event, fan favourite Dan Hooker suffered a TKO loss to Benoit Saint-Denis, with the Frenchman finishing the Kiwi fighter late in the second round.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES - New UCLA football head coach Bob Chesney formally introduced himself to the UCLA crowd Saturday night at Pauley Pavilion and he and his staff were certainly treated to a show, just not with the end result that any Bruins fans were hoping for.\n\nUCLA (15-7, 7-4) battled it out with Indiana (15-7, 6-5) for a full two halves plus two overtime periods in front of a roaring home UCLA crowd, but the final score favored the Hoosiers 98-97.\n\nUCLA head coach Mick Cronin wasn't impressed with the fight his team showed for all 50 minutes, rather he had one observation that he made throughout his postgame conference.\n\n\"Defense was awful all night. We deserved to lose,\" Cronin said. \"We went through a stretch where we were pouting and letting one shot affect the next shot. We couldn't score for a long time, that's why we got down by 10. Missing wide open shot after wide open shot.\"\n\nJohn Panganiban-The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA forward Tyler Bilodeau (34) fights for possession during a Big 10 basketball game against Indiana, Saturday, January 31st, 2026 in Los Angeles, California\n\nIt was a poor shooting night for the Bruins across the board with just a 39.5% field goal percentage and 31.8% from three. While the Hoosiers started off equally slow, they found their shot in a big way throughout the second half. At one point, Indiana went on a 12-0 run and led by as much as 10 at multiple points late in the second half, while the Bruins suffered a dismal stretch of shooting, going 0-11 from the field at one point in a scoreless stretch that lasted nearly seven minutes.\n\nThe Bruins surged back with a minute-and-a-half remaining and with just a single second left on the clock sophomore guard Trent Perry, while being double teamed, fired a three pointer from the top of the arc to tie the game at 76 and send the game into overtime.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm just proud of how fought. Sent a good team into double overtime,\" Perry said. \"We're going to carry on with this lesson and move on to the next one.\"\n\nJohn Panganiban-The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA forward Tyler Bilodeau (34) tips off for overtime during a Big 10 basketball game against Indiana, Saturday, January 31st, 2026 in Los Angeles, California\n\nThe Bruins found their defensive intensity in the first overtime, but the offensive accuracy didn't follow. Five minutes went by and the score remained, this time at 84, when Perry missed his second attempt at saving the game for UCLA in the final seconds.\n\nFoul trouble followed UCLA into the second overtime period. 10 of the Hoosiers' 14 points in the second overtime came off of free throws, including the pivotal point that sealed the game for Indiana.\n\nThe final plays of the game unfolded with an immense amount of drama. Tied at 97, both Bruins and Hoosiers scrambled for a rebound after a missed layup by Indiana freshman forward Trent Sisley.\n\nJohn Panganiban-The Sporting Tribune\n\nUCLA guard Trent Perry(0) celebrates a buzzer beater during a Big 10 basketball game against Indiana, Saturday, January 31st, 2026 in Los Angeles, California\n\nThe Hoosiers came down with the ball briefly until it was knocked out of bounds. The ball was awarded to the Hoosiers and Cronin challenged. The result remained the same after the replay review, and even through Cronin maintained his belief that the ball went off of a Hoosier first before it went out of bounds, he resigned himself to the result.\n\nIndiana inbounded the ball and Sisley cut in for a game-winning layup. Senior guard Donovan Dent went up to defend against the layup but fouled Sisley in the process, sending the freshman to the line to make the game-winning free throw with less than a second left.\n\nTRENT PERRY CONTINUES THE COMEBACK\n\nThe Bruins were Down NINE Points with 75 seconds left🤯pic.twitter.com/WjnzTn2fFV\n\n— The College Sports Company (@CollegeSportsCo) February 1, 2026\n\nCronin was especially frustrated with how this play went down, stating that that exact scenario was something UCLA had practiced multiple times over the last few days.\n\nIt wasn't the result that UCLA was looking for, but the fact that they battled back at all is something that the Bruins are taking pride in after the loss.\n\n\"We rallied back down late... that builds a confidence as a team. We know we can fight back,\" Dent said. \"It just gives you confidence going into the next one.\"",

Sleepiness …",
    "fullText": "Objectives:\n\n To inform the debate over whether human sleep can be chronically reduced without consequences, we conducted a dose-response chronic sleep restriction experiment in which waking neurobehavioral and sleep physiological functions were monitored and compared to those for total sleep deprivation.\n\nDesign:\n\n The chronic sleep restriction experiment involved randomization to one of three sleep doses (4 h, 6 h, or 8 h time in bed per night), which were maintained for 14 consecutive days. The total sleep deprivation experiment involved 3 nights without sleep (0 h time in bed). Each study also involved 3 baseline (pre-deprivation) days and 3 recovery days.\n\nSetting:\n\n Both experiments were conducted under standardized laboratory conditions with continuous behavioral, physiological and medical monitoring.\n\nParticipants:\n\n A total of n = 48 healthy adults (ages 21-38) participated in the experiments.\n\nInterventions:\n\n Noctumal sleep periods were restricted to 8 h, 6 h or 4 h per day for 14 days, or to 0 h for 3 days. All other sleep was prohibited.\n\nResults:\n\n Chronic restriction of sleep periods to 4 h or 6 h per night over 14 consecutive days resulted in significant cumulative, dose-dependent deficits in cognitive performance on all tasks. Subjective sleepiness ratings showed an acute response to sleep restriction but only small further increases on subsequent days, and did not significantly differentiate the 6 h and 4 h conditions. Polysomnographic variables and delta power in the non-REM sleep EEG-a putative marker of sleep homeostasis--displayed an acute response to sleep restriction with negligible further changes across the 14 restricted nights. Comparison of chronic sleep restriction to total sleep deprivation showed that the latter resulted in disproportionately large waking neurobehavioral and sleep delta power responses relative to how much sleep was lost. A statistical model revealed that, regardless of the mode of sleep deprivation, lapses in behavioral alertness were near-linearly related to the cumulative duration of wakefulness in excess of 15.84 h (s.e. 0.73 h).\n\nConclusions:\n\n Since chronic restriction of sleep to 6 h or less per night produced cognitive performance deficits equivalent to up to 2 nights of total sleep deprivation, it appears that even relatively moderate sleep restriction can seriously impair waking neurobehavioral functions in healthy adults. Sleepiness ratings suggest that subjects were largely unaware of these increasing cognitive deficits, which may explain why the impact of chronic sleep restriction on waking cognitive functions is often assumed to be benign. Physiological sleep responses to chronic restriction did not mirror waking neurobehavioral responses, but cumulative wakefulness in excess of a 15.84 h predicted performance lapses across all four experimental conditions. This suggests that sleep debt is perhaps best understood as resulting in additional wakefulness that has a neurobiological \"cost\" which accumulates over time.",

    "description": "A comprehensive security analysis revealing the largest AI agent deployment vulnerability to datef",
    "fullText": "A comprehensive security analysis revealing the largest AI agent deployment vulnerability to date\n\nBetween December 2025 and January 2026, OpenClaw (formerly Clawdbot, then Moltbot) an open-source AI personal assistant experienced explosive viral growth, accumulating over 100,000 GitHub stars and tens of thousands of deployments worldwide. This research reveals that at least 42,665 instances are publicly exposed on the internet, with 5,194 instances actively verified as vulnerable through systematic scanning. Of the verified instances, 93.4% exhibit critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities enabling unauthenticated access to the gateway control plane, with potential for Remote Code Execution (RCE) (specifically on instances with paired companion nodes)..\n\nThis study combines passive internet-wide detection through Shodan and Censys search engines with active verification using ClawdHunter, a custom-built security scanner. The findings expose a catastrophic gap between OpenClaw’s “local-first, privacy-focused” marketing and its real-world deployment patterns: many instances deployed on commercial cloud infrastructure, contradicting the project’s fundamental security assumptions.\n\nThe research documents three critical failures: (1) insecure-by-default configuration in early versions (Clawdbot/Moltbot) encouraging 0.0.0.0 binding without authentication, (2) rapid viral adoption overwhelming users’ security awareness, and (3) widespread deployment abandonment leaving 90% of instances running outdated, unmaintained code. With documented attack paths enabling credential theft, browser control, and potential remote code execution, this represents the largest security incident in sovereign AI history.\n\nKeywords: OpenClaw, Moltbot, Clawdbot, AI agents, security vulnerability, RCE, authentication bypass, WebSocket security\n\nThe concept of “sovereign AI” artificial intelligence systems that users control entirely, running on their own hardware without dependence on cloud services has emerged as a compelling alternative to centralized AI platforms. Projects like OpenClaw promise users complete ownership of their data, freedom from corporate surveillance, and the ability to customize their AI assistants without restrictions.\n\nOpenClaw, launched in late 2025 as “Clawdbot,” epitomizes this vision. Users deploy a local gateway on their Mac, Linux machine, or VPS, connect it to messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, and gain an AI assistant capable of file system access, web automation, calendar management, and shell command execution-all purportedly running securely on trusted hardware.\n\nBetween January 24-27, 2026, OpenClaw experienced unprecedented viral growth. The project gained 100,000+ GitHub stars within days, with coverage from Wired, CNET, Axios, and major technology outlets. Developers worldwide rushed to deploy their own instances, drawn by the allure of “ChatGPT that runs on your computer” and “your own personal JARVIS.”\n\nHowever, this explosive adoption occurred faster than the community’s ability to understand and mitigate security implications. Early reports emerged of exposed instances, Early reports emerged of exposed instances, with security researchers documenting hundreds of publicly accessible gateways. Subsequent investigations by independent security researchers suggested the problem was larger, but lacked comprehensive quantification.\n\nOpenClaw operates through a three-tier architecture:\n\nThe Gateway’s WebSocket interface is the critical control plane for all operations. According to official documentation, it defaults to binding on ws://127.0.0.1:18789 (loopback only), which should restrict access to processes on the same machine.\n\nOpenClaw’s branding history is crucial to understanding the exposure landscape:\n\nDecember 2025 - January 27, 2026: “Clawdbot”\n\nJanuary 30, 2026 - Present: “OpenClaw”\n\nThis fragmentation matters because many users deployed early versions and never updated. My data shows 90% of exposed instances run outdated “Clawdbot” or “Moltbot” code, likely abandoned after initial experimentation.\n\nPrior to this research, several security issues were documented:\n\nGHSA-g8p2-7wf7-98mq (1-Click RCE) Official GitHub Security Advisory describing token exfiltration leading to gateway compromise. The advisory explicitly states this vulnerability enables “1-click RCE” through modification of config and invocation of privileged actions.\n\nNote: The RCE capability in the advisory refers to scenarios where attackers gain token access and can invoke agent tools. Direct shell execution via system.run requires a paired macOS/iOS/Android node. However, the gateway itself provides access to browser automation, credential stores, and configuration files that enable significant compromise even without direct shell access.\n\nUnauthenticated WebSocket Access Community reports (GitHub issue #1971) noted that instances binding to 0.0.0.0 without gateway tokens allow unauthenticated connections, exposing the full control plane.\n\nConfig File Exposure Credentials stored in plaintext ~/.openclaw/openclaw.json including:\n\nPrompt Injection Natural language interface susceptible to malicious instructions embedded in emails, messages, or web content processed by the agent.\n\nOpenClaw’s security model assumes users will:\n\nHowever, several factors undermine this model:\n\nReverse Proxy Misconfigurations Users deploying Nginx or Caddy without proper X-Forwarded-For validation cause the Gateway to perceive external requests as localhost, bypassing authentication checks.\n\nCloud Deployment Pattern Despite “local-first” marketing, many users deploy to VPS (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, AWS) for “always-on” availability. These deployments inherently expose 0.0.0.0 unless explicitly configured otherwise.\n\nWizard Defaults The onboarding wizard (openclaw onboard) historically defaulted to accessibility over security, only recently adding prominent security warnings and token generation.\n\nUser Expertise Gap The viral adoption brought non-expert users unfamiliar with concepts like loopback interfaces, authentication tokens, and network security best practices.\n\nEarly Versions (Clawdbot/Moltbot - Dec 2025 to Jan 2026):\n\nCurrent Version (OpenClaw - Jan 30, 2026+):\n\nAccording to official documentation (as of January 2026)\n\nThis research reveals that 90% of exposed instances run outdated Clawdbot/Moltbot versions that predate these security improvements. The vulnerability findings primarily reflect the security posture of legacy deployments, not the current OpenClaw codebase.\n\nCollection Period: January 28-31, 2026\n\nMethodology: Search engines continuously scan the IPv4 address space, indexing services on commonly used ports.I aggregated results from multiple queries across Shodan and Censys, deduplicating by IP address and identifying distinct project name variants.\n\nTo validate and characterize the exposure, I developed ClawdHunter v3.0, a custom Python-based security scanner.\n\nStage 1: Fingerprinting (Confidence Scoring)\n\nThe scanner employs a three-tier keyword matching system:\n\nTier 1 (95-100% confidence): Project-specific identifiers\n\nTier 2 (75-95% confidence): Technical stack indicators\n\nTier 3 (60-75% confidence): Generic patterns\n\nOnly instances with confidence ≥ 60% proceed to vulnerability testing.\n\nStage 2: WebSocket Vulnerability Check\n\nThis test attempts to establish an unauthenticated WebSocket connection to the gateway. Success indicates the control plane is accessible without credentials.\n\nNote: CRITICAL classification indicates unauthenticated access to the gateway control plane, enabling credential theft, configuration manipulation, and browser control. Full RCE via system.run additionally requires a paired macOS/iOS/Android node, which was not measured in this research.\n\nFor each detection and vulnerability, the scanner archives:\n\nI conducted four distinct scanning campaigns:\n\nRead-Only Approach: All scanning operations were strictly passive:\n\nTotal Detected Instances: 42,665+ (minimum estimate)\n\nThe overwhelming majority (90.3%) of detected instances identify as “Clawdbot” or “Moltbot” - outdated names abandoned by the project. This suggests:\n\nCritical Finding: Despite OpenClaw’s “local-first, privacy-focused” marketing, many instances run on commercial cloud infrastructure. This directly contradicts the project’s security assumptions, which presume local deployment on trusted hardware.\n\nDetection Accuracy: The scanner achieved 100% high-confidence detection with zero medium or low-confidence matches. This validates the multi-tier fingerprinting approach and suggests a near-zero false positive rate.\n\nDataset 1: Censys “openclaw” (2,000 IPs)\n\nDataset 2: Censys “clawdbot” (2,000 IPs)\n\nDataset 3: Censys “moltbot” (2,000 IPs)\n\nDataset 4: Shodan Mixed (1,967 IPs)\n\nAnalysis of vulnerable instances by port:\n\nMost instances use the default port configuration with minimal customization. The presence of instances on ports 443 and 80 indicates reverse proxy deployments (Nginx, Caddy, Cloudflare Tunnel), though these configurations did not correlate with improved security posture.\n\nUnauthenticated Gateway Access (4,851 instances)\n\nAccording to OpenClaw’s official security advisory (GHSA-g8p2-7wf7-98mq), unauthenticated WebSocket access to the gateway enables:\n\nNote: system.run is only available when a supporting node is paired to the gateway. According to OpenClaw documentation, system.run is a macOS/iOS/Android-specific tool that executes commands on paired devices, not on the gateway host itself. The prevalence of paired nodes in exposed instances was not measured in this research.\n\nExtrapolating from the verified sample:\n\nConfirmed Impact (Without Requiring Paired Nodes):\n\nThe CVSS 10.0 reflects the complete loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the affected system, regardless of whether direct shell access is achieved.\n\nPerhaps the most striking finding is the disconnect between OpenClaw’s positioning and reality:\n\nMarketing: “Local-first, privacy-focused AI assistant running on your own hardware”\n\nReality: Many instances run on public cloud VPS infrastructure despite the “local-first” positioning\n\nThis paradox emerges from several factors:\n\n“Always-On” Requirement Users want their AI assistant available 24/7, reachable from their phone while away from home. Desktop deployments don’t satisfy this need, driving users toward VPS providers.\n\nEase of Deployment Cloud providers offer one-click deployments and consistent environments, whereas local setup requires dealing with ISP restrictions, dynamic IP addresses, and firewall configurations.\n\nPerformance Expectations VPS instances guarantee consistent uptime and bandwidth, whereas home networks may be unreliable or bandwidth-constrained.\n\nHowever, cloud deployment fundamentally undermines the security model:\n\nThe project’s security guidance assumes localhost deployment; cloud deployment patterns were an afterthought. This misalignment between assumptions and usage is a root cause of the crisis.\n\n90% of detected instances run outdated “Clawdbot” or “Moltbot” code. This suggests:\n\nViral Experimentation During the Jan 24-27 viral period, thousands of developers deployed OpenClaw out of curiosity or FOMO (fear of missing out). Many likely experimented briefly and moved on without proper decommissioning.\n\nUpdate Friction OpenClaw releases frequent updates, but there’s no auto-update mechanism. Users must manually pull updates, restart services, and reconfigure-friction that casual experimenters won’t overcome.\n\nBreaking Changes The rebrand from Clawdbot → Moltbot → OpenClaw introduced configuration changes and naming conflicts. Users running old versions may not realize they’re outdated.\n\nSecurity Unawareness Many users who deployed during the viral period may not be aware of:\n\nThis creates a zombie instance problem: thousands of unmaintained, vulnerable deployments with owners who’ve moved on.\n\nThe discrepancy between my numbers and earlier reports reflects:\n\nBoth the 42K (internet-wide footprint) and 5K (active verification) numbers are valid - they measure different things:\n\nThis incident has profound implications for the broader “sovereign AI” movement:\n\nTrust Damage The narrative that “running AI locally = security and privacy” is significantly undermined when 93% of deployments are critically vulnerable. Users may lose faith in self-hosted alternatives.\n\nRegulatory Attention Governments and regulators already scrutinizing AI may use this incident to justify restrictions on self-hosted AI agents, citing security externalities.\n\nEcosystem Maturity The gap between “deploy in 5 minutes” marketing and “secure deployment requires expertise” reality highlights ecosystem immaturity. Sovereign AI needs better security tooling, defaults, and education.\n\nCentralization Pressure If self-hosting proves too risky for average users, demand may shift back toward centralized providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) with professional security teams — ironically reversing the sovereignty goals.\n\nTemporal Snapshot - My data represents a point-in-time snapshot (Jan 28–31, 2026). Instances come online and offline constantly; the true current exposure may differ.\n\nFalse Negatives ClawdHunter’s detection methodology may miss:\n\nEstimated false negative rate: 10–20%\n\nSearch Engine Coverage Shodan and Censys don’t scan the entire IPv4 space continuously. Some instances may exist but not be indexed. my 42,665 number is likely a lower bound.\n\nNo Exploitation - I verified the presence of vulnerabilities (unauthenticated WebSocket access) but did not exploit them. Several important caveats:\n\n1. Shell Execution Limitations: The system.run tool for shell command execution is only available on instances with paired macOS/iOS/Android nodes, not on the gateway itself. This research did not measure the prevalence of paired nodes among exposed instances.\n\n2. RCE Classification Basis: The “RCE-capable” classification relies on:\n\n3. Verified Attack Surface: Even without system.run, unauthenticated gateway access enables:\n\nWhile the complete RCE attack chain requires a paired node, the verified attack surface alone constitutes critical vulnerabilities enabling significant compromise.\n\nImmediate Actions (Within 24 Hours):\n\nCheck your binding configuration\n\nIf you see \"bind\": \"0.0.0.0\" and you're not on a private network, you are exposed.\n\nVerify authentication is enabled\n\nIf empty or null, generate a token immediately:\n\nTest from external network Try connecting to http://your-public-ip:18789/ from a phone (off WiFi). If you see the dashboard without entering a password, you are vulnerable.\n\nShort-Term Hardening (Within 1 Week):\n\nUse Tailscale for remote access Instead of binding to 0.0.0.0, keep 127.0.0.1 and use Tailscale:\n\nEnable firewall rules If you must bind to 0.0.0.0, whitelist only your IP:\n\nRotate all credentials If your instance was exposed:\n\nNote: OpenClaw has implemented mandatory authentication and secure defaults in recent versions. However, 90% of detected instances in this research run outdated versions (clawdbot/moltbot) that lack these protections.\n\nSecurity benchmarks Develop “Sovereign AI Security Framework” with testable requirements for:\n\nCertification program Third-party security audits and “Sovereign AI Certified” badge for projects meeting standards.\n\nShared responsibility model Clear delineation:\n\nSecurity-first onboarding Every sovereign AI project should have mandatory security wizard before first use.\n\nDeployment patterns library Curated collection of:\n\nIncident response playbooks “What to do if your AI agent is compromised” guides with step-by-step remediation.\n\nThis research quantifies what anecdotal reports suggested: the OpenClaw security crisis is larger and more severe than previously understood. At least 42,665 instances have been detected on the public internet, with 5,194 actively verified as vulnerable through systematic scanning. Of these verified instances, 93.4% exhibit critical authentication bypass vulnerabilities enabling unauthenticated remote code execution.\n\nThe findings reveal three interconnected failures:\n\nDesign Failure: Security-by-default was sacrificed for ease of use. The gateway’s localhost-only binding was easily bypassed by users deploying to cloud VPS infrastructure, while authentication tokens were optional rather than mandatory.\n\nAdoption Failure: Viral growth (100K+ GitHub stars within days) overwhelmed users’ capacity to understand security implications. Many deployed instances without grasping the risks of public exposure.\n\nMaintenance Failure: 90% of detected instances run outdated code (“Clawdbot” or “Moltbot”), suggesting mass abandonment after initial experimentation. These zombie instances remain exposed indefinitely.\n\nThe cloud paradox - many instances on commercial VPS despite “local-first” marketing - highlights a fundamental misalignment between the project’s security assumptions and users’ actual deployment patterns. The assumption that users would run OpenClaw on trusted local hardware proved incorrect; the reality is globally distributed cloud deployments with varying levels of security expertise.\n\nHowever, this is not purely a critique of OpenClaw. The project represents an important experiment in sovereign AI - user-controlled intelligence free from corporate gatekeepers. The security failures are growing pains of a nascent ecosystem, not fundamental flaws in the sovereignty concept.\n\nThe OpenClaw maintainers have responded constructively with security advisories, improved defaults, and enhanced documentation. The broader sovereign AI ecosystem is learning from this incident, with increased focus on security-first design and deployment education.\n\nFor OpenClaw to fulfill its promise, several shifts are necessary:\n\nThe larger lesson extends beyond OpenClaw: as AI agents gain more autonomy and system access, the security stakes escalate dramatically. A compromised chatbot might leak conversations; a compromised autonomous agent can execute arbitrary code, exfiltrate credentials, and persist indefinitely. The sovereign AI movement must prioritize security commensurate with these risks.\n\nThis research provides a baseline: 42,665 exposed instances, 93.4% vulnerable. Future work should track remediation progress, document attack patterns in the wild, and develop improved security frameworks for the next generation of sovereign AI systems.\n\nThe promise of sovereign AI - personal, private, user-controlled intelligence - remains compelling. But that promise is only achievable with security by design, user education, and ecosystem maturity. The OpenClaw incident is both a cautionary tale and a catalyst for necessary evolution.",

    "description": "Amazon's week included a White House screening of the \"Melania\" documentary and another massive round of layoffs.",
    "fullText": "It was a turbulent week for Amazon.\n\nFrom a bungled email prematurely announcing another massive round of layoffs to scrutiny around the company's $75 million investment in a documentary about the first lady, Amazon heads into its quarterly earnings report next week surrounded by a deafening level of outside noise.\n\nOn Saturday, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy and a top entertainment exec from the company joined a group of CEOs, politicians and celebrities at the White House for a private screening of \"Melania,\" which was produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Melania Trump.\n\nThe event was roundly criticized for appearing tone deaf as it occurred mere hours after federal immigration agents shot and killed urgent care nurse Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, the second such deadly incident there in less than three weeks.\n\nWhile most of the biggest names in tech stayed mum on the matter, many people in the industry expressed outrage over the incidents, and urged other members of the tech community to publicly denounce the killing of Pretti and the prior shooting of Renee Good, as well as President Donald Trump's immigration policies.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook, who attended the screening, subsequently issued a statement calling for a \"deescalation\" after the recent violence but without mentioning the two fatal shootings. Amazon hasn't commented on the matter.\n\nAmazon's ties to the Melania film, which officially hit theatres on Friday, was awkward enough given the political tensions building in Minneapolis and elsewhere. The price tag has raised further questions about Amazon's agenda and whether the company is trying to curry favor with the president.\n\n\"I'm not involved in that. That was done with my wife,\" President Trump told reporters on Thursday at a premier for the movie in Washington, D.C.. \"I think it's a very important movie. I think it's really going to be very important. It shows life in the White House. It's a big deal, actually.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon MGM said in an email, \"We licensed the film for one reason and one reason only — because we think customers are going to love it.\"\n\nEarly ticket sales for the documentary have been weak, and the film is projected to bring in about $5 million during its opening weekend in the U.S. and Canada, Puck News reported, citing National Research Group forecasting data.\n\nMaking the timing even worse for Amazon, which has also agreed to stream a three-part docuseries through Prime Video, the company on Wednesday initiated another round of mass layoffs impacting about 16,000 corporate workers. The company let go of 14,000 employees last October.\n\nThe announcement was preempted a day early by an inadvertent email sent to cloud employees, which alluded to \"organizational changes,\" and a post from Amazon's human resources boss Beth Galetti.\n\nThe layoffs are part of a broader effort by Jassy to cut costs and \"remove bureaucracy\" at the company, while it pushes to invest heavily in artificial intelligence. Some employees previously told CNBC that the cost cuts and rolling layoffs have damaged morale.\n\nIn a Reddit forum for Amazon employees, some users questioned the rationale of the company's money-saving efforts alongside its investment in \"Melania.\"\n\n\"With $75 million we could have given each laid off employee about $4,500,\" wrote one user. \"But instead we spent it on the ridiculous Melania movie. Ashamed to work at Amazon.\"\n\nAnalysts at Citizens said this week that they expect Amazon's 30,000 job cuts to generate up to $8 billion of cost savings in 2026.\n\nIn a segment for \"The Daily Show\" that aired Thursday, host Desi Lydic called it a \"cash grab,\" and criticized Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and former CEO.\n\n\"Why would Jeff Bezos, a billionaire who has tons of business with the government, run by a famously corrupt president known for loving bribes, overpay for a Melania documentary?,\" Lydic said. \"Hmm, let me think.\"\n\nAnd filmmaker Julie Cohen, who previously worked with Amazon on documentaries, told The New York Times that the Melania price tag was abnormal and suggests the company \"is buying something else for their money.\"\n\nAfter he was repeatedly attacked by Trump in his first term, Bezos has cozied up to the president this time around. He's dined with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago residence, and he attended the inauguration a year ago. Amazon, meanwhile, donated $1 million to Trump's inauguration fund and helped pay for Trump's $300 million ballroom renovation.\n\nThere was even more drama in the broader Bezos universe this week after multiple outlets reported that the Washington Post, which Bezos has owned since 2013, is preparing broad layoffs across the newsroom, with the sports, local and international sections expected to be impacted.\n\nThe newspaper's White House team wrote a letter to Bezos, describing the importance of the work of those teams and telling their boss that they need \"collaboration with all corners of the newsroom.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the company is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results, wrapping up earnings season for the tech giants (though Nvidia reports later in the month).\n\nAmazon is expected to report revenue growth of about 13% to $211.3 billion, according to analysts surveyed by LSEG. The expansion is being driven by Amazon Web Services and digital advertising, which are both projected to show growth of around 22%, based on data from FactSet.\n\nAnalysts at KeyBanc Capital Markets upped their price target on the stock this week and kept their buy recommendation, in part due to an acceleration at AWS, boosted by a recent deal with OpenAI. Amazon is now in talks to invest up to $50 billion in OpenAI, CNBC confirmed this week.\n\nAs Amazon races to keep pace with rivals in AI, the company is boosting spending on data centers. In the earnings report, capital expenditures are likely to show an increase of 24% from a year earlier to almost $34.5 billion, according to LSEG.\n\nThe KeyBanc analysts said that while those rising costs will weigh on profitability, \"we believe Amazon will continue looking across the organization for further efficiencies to minimize the potential margin impact.\"\n\nWATCH: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on the 'unprecedented' demand for AI compute",

    "description": "Package managers are everywhere, with seemingly every language and operating system implementing their own solution. The lack of interoperability between these systems means that multi-lingual projects are unable to express precise dependencies across language ecosystems, and external system and hardware dependencies are typically implicit and unversioned. We define HyperRes, a formal system for describing versioned dependency resolution using a hypergraph that is expressive enough to model many ecosystems and solve dependency constraints across them. We define translations from dozens of existing package managers to HyperRes and comprehensively demonstrate that dependency resolution can work across ecosystems that are currently distinct. This does not require users to shift their choice of package managers; instead, HyperRes allows for the translation of packaging metadata between ecosystems, and for solving to be precisely specialised to a particular deployment environment.",

    "description": "Rambling speeches, wind turbine obsession, and an ‘unhinged’ letter to Norway’s prime minister have caused concern whether the rest of his term is ‘sustainable’",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nIn the final days of his presidency, Richard Nixon “came unglued”, said Jamelle Bouie in The New York Times. He reportedly became irrational and obsessive, making wild suggestions and rambling about his past triumphs. His son-in-law and adviser Ed Cox recalled that Nixon would wander the halls of the White House “talking to pictures of former presidents”.\n\nAlas, it seems Donald Trump has reached similar depths of “self-destructive mania”. Witness his recent unhinged letter to Norway’s prime minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, in which Trump implied that he was entitled to seize Greenland owing to Norway’s failure to award him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nWhere to begin? Norway’s government doesn’t choose the winner of the prize. Nor does it own Greenland. And Trump hasn’t, as he insisted, “stopped 8 Wars PLUS”, or anything close. “We have three years left with a mad king. It does not feel sustainable.”\n\n“Trump has the world’s most consequential case of untreated logorrhea,” said Susan B. Glasser in The New Yorker. According to a new study, in this first year of his second term he has spoken 1,977,609 words in presidential appearances – 145% more than in the first year of his first term.\n\nIn his speech in Davos last week, he rambled on for a full hour and a half. In the course of his address he, among other things, explained that only “stupid people” buy wind turbines, and admitted that he had decided to raise tariffs on Switzerland because its prime minister – “a woman” – had “rubbed me the wrong way”. He also kept confusing Iceland and Greenland. Americans are somewhat inured to Trump’s “manic performance art”, but the stunned reaction of Europeans should be a wake-up call. Many there were openly asking: has this man lost his mind? Is he still capable of running the US?\n\nIn “a saner, better world”, Trump’s cabinet officials would be discussing invoking the 25th Amendment, said Jim Geraghty in National Review. But of course none of them would dare suggest he was unfit to discharge his powers. Nor did President Biden’s colleagues when he started zoning out in meetings and forgot the name of his defence secretary, Lloyd Austin, referring to him in an interview simply as “the black man”.\n\n“After one president who went senile in office and another who is nuttier than a Payday candy bar, we can only conclude that the 25th Amendment of the Constitution is there for decoration.”",

    "fullText": "A famed crypto influencer has predicted Bitcoin’s price could fall to $30,000.\n\nThe comments come after a global market crash.\n\nTechnical signals have reinforced the bearish outlook.\n\nAnalysts and prominent market commentators have warned of deeper losses for Bitcoin following a violent sell-off across global financial markets that wiped out trillions of dollars in value.\n\nOn Thursday, well-known crypto influencer Crypto Bitlord warned that Bitcoin could fall significantly further, identifying $30,000 as the next major support level.\n\n“The next major support for bitcoin is $30k,” the X account wrote.\n\nBenjamin Cowen, founder of crypto analytics platform Into The Cryptoverse, echoed the bearish outlook, saying Bitcoin’s weakness aligns with historical trends and macroeconomic tightening.\n\n“Today, we’re going to talk about Bitcoin and discuss why the price is dropping and why I think it will likely continue to drop,” Cowen said in a recent YouTube video.\n\nCowen said he believes Bitcoin has already transitioned into a bear market after peaking in October 2025.\n\n“I do think Bitcoin is, in fact, in a bear market,” he said.\n\nBitcoin’s slide comes amid a broader global market rout that saw roughly $3 trillion in market value erased in less than an hour on Thursday.\n\nPrecious metals, despite recent historic rallies, were not spared.\n\nGold lost around $1.5 trillion in market value, with prices falling nearly 10% from recent highs, while silver fell about 12%.\n\nLongtime Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff took his chance to weigh in on BTC’s falling, arguing that the asset has significantly underperformed gold over the long term despite growing institutional support.\n\n“Bitcoin is now worth just 15.5 ounces of gold, down 57% from its 2021 high and just 10% above its 2017 high,” Schiff wrote.\n\n“Despite all the hype and support from Wall Street and the Trump administration, most people who now own Bitcoin would have been better off buying gold or silver instead,” he added.\n\nFrom a technical standpoint, analysts say Bitcoin’s chart structure has deteriorated further.\n\nVictor Olanrewaju, an analyst at CCN, said Bitcoin confirmed a bearish reversal pattern on the daily chart after breaking key support levels.\n\n“From a technical perspective, Bitcoin’s price extended its sell-off, breaking below the $86,400 neckline and confirming a head-and-shoulders breakdown on the daily chart,” Olanrewaju said.",

    "fullText": "Every time the crypto market enters a dramatic phase, ARK Invest CEO Cathie Wood is one of the first investors I turn to in order to understand the changing dynamics on the charts.\n\nWood is a veteran investor in the digital assets market. In fact, she claimed that ARK Invest was the first public asset manager to gain Bitcoin (BTC) exposure in 2015.\n\nBitcoin hadn't reached even the $500 price mark in 2015, but it was a significant uptick since its launch in 2009. But Wood's pro-crypto move was met with sharp criticism.\n\nHowever, the confidence seems to have paid off over the years as Bitcoin kept hitting new highs. ARK Invest estimates the cryptocurrency's price will hit $1 million in 2030.\n\nWood also keeps buying shares of crypto companies such as:\n\nCoinbase (Nasdaq: COIN), the largest crypto exchange in the U.S.\n\nRobinhood Markets (Nasdaq: HOOD), an e-trading platform with crypto and tokenized stock offerings\n\nBlock (NYSE: SQ), Jack Dorsey's Bitcoin technology company\n\nBitmine Immersion Technologies (NYSE: BMNR), the world's largest Ethereum (ETH) treasury company\n\nBullish (NYSE: BLSH), the crypto exchange backed by Peter Thiel\n\nGiven Wood's deep expertise in crypto investments, it is worth understanding her perspective in the wake of Bitcoin's crash below $80,000 on Jan. 31.\n\nLorenzo Valente, ARK Invest's Director of Research, Digital Assets, recently shared an analysis in which he compared gold's market cap as a percentage of the U.S. M2 money supply.\n\nM2 is a broad measure of the U.S. money supply (cash, checking, savings, money market funds).\n\nAs per the analysis, gold's market cap is 170% of the entire U.S. money supply right now.\n\nThe figure is an all-time high (ATH); in fact, it is as high as it was in 1934 during the Great Depression and only slightly above the figure in 1980 when inflation peaked, the chart showed.\n\nIn simple words, gold is as expensive as it can be. Such peaks usually happen during periods of economic stress and dollar regime shift and often mark turning points, Valente said. For instance, gold crashed 60% after 1980.\n\nEven right now, it feels like a \"pivot moment\" and while nobody knows what happens next, those who know can make huge gains, he added.\n\nWhen ARK Invest shared its 2026 outlook on Jan. 15, the asset manager noted that the correlation between the Bitcoin and gold prices has been very low at 0.14 since early 2020.\n\nThis is exactly what Wood reiterated in response to Valente's X post. In simple terms, Bitcoin and gold usually don't move together on a daily or monthly basis.",

It's nearly unfathomable to think that Sears, a brand that was bigger than Walmart in its day, would now be a chain with less than 10 stores poised to close once leases and other obligations are worked out.\n\nOne of the last Sears operated at a mall near our home, and it had limited merchandise, a handful of workers, and was only kept open so its owner had leverage in transferring its lease to the Dick's Sporting Goods that has taken over the spot. While it remained open, it was a sad reminder of what the chain once was.\n\nPast prominence, however, does not guarantee anything in the present. That's why Saks Global finds itself fighting for survival in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and multiple legacy brands have closed their doors.\n\nNow, another famous brand, Eddie Bauer, appears poised to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy and close its fleet of more than 200 retail locations, according to a report from Women's Wear Daily (WWD).\n\nEddie Bauer has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy twice before.\n\nIts first bankruptcy happened in 2003.\n\nEddie Bauer’s parent company at the time, Spiegel Inc., filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2003.\n\nSpiegel’s financial troubles led to the closure of many Eddie Bauer stores.\n\nAfter restructuring, Eddie Bauer emerged from Spiegel’s bankruptcy in June 2005 as a stand-alone company called Eddie Bauer Holdings, Inc.\n\nIts second filing took place in 2009.\n\nOn June 17, 2009, Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on its own due to heavy debt, slumping sales, and recession-era pressures.\n\nAt the time, the company had hundreds of retail stores and debts that strained its finances.\n\nDuring the bankruptcy process, Eddie Bauer secured financing to continue operations while seeking a buyer.\n\nIn July 2009, Eddie Bauer was acquired out of bankruptcy by private equity firm Golden Gate Capital at a bankruptcy auction for around $286 million, according to a Golden Gate Capital press release.\n\nNow, the company is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy again and has plans to close all its stores.\n\n\"Eddie Bauer is preparing to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, with sources claiming that the retailer would be closing down an estimated 200 locations across North America,\" according to a Jan. 29 WWD story.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPayton Pritchard is among the most underrated No. 3 scoring options in the league.\n\nThe 6-foot-1 Boston Celtics guard has done nothing but improve his game since entering the league in 2020, and with Jayson Tatum sidelined with an Achilles injury, he’s received a more significant offensive role with the 2024 NBA champions.\n\nAccording to the X/Twitter account 'Real App, ' Payton currently leads the NBA in an impressive stat.\n\n“Payton Pritchard has the most games in the NBA this season with 25+ points & zero free throws attempted,” the notable statistics-based account stated.\n\nWhy is that stat so admirable? Well, it’s common for players to erupt for 25+ points while attempting multiple free throws. In some cases, it’s so extreme that fans will throw out terms like ‘foul baiter’ and ‘free throw merchant’ to help diminish a player’s performance.\n\nWhen an individual doesn’t get any whistles in a 25-point outing, it means they had no choice but to fight through contact and score at a high clip. Pritchard has done just that this season, helping the Celtics navigate life without Tatum.\n\nPritchard is averaging 17.0 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game this year, shooting 45.9% from the field and 35.3% from downtown. The Celtics will need Pritchard to remain consistent if they want to return to the NBA Finals.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors predicted to cut ties with Jonathan Kuminga, acquire $108 million two-time blocks leader",

    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are preparing for their showdown in Super Bowl LX, the other 30 teams in the NFL are already in offseason mode. On Friday, the NFL shared some crucial information with all of them: the salary cap projection for the upcoming season is out.\n\nAccording to a report by NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, the league will set its spending ceiling for 2026 in the range of $301.2 million to $305.7 million per team. For comparison, the cap was set at $279.2 million for the current season.\n\nAt between 7.9% and 9.5%, the increase from 2025 to 2026 marks the latest major jump in the cap. In the five years since taking a one-year dip due to the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, it has grown by more than $100 million.\n\nDespite having been among the most active team in the NFL last offseason, the Patriots are again in decent shape heading into 2026.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, who is using the middle ground of $303.45 million for his calculations, the AFC champions are currently projected to be $42.6 million under the cap with 50 players signed. This places them in the top-10 for the next league year.\n\nNew England may be less financially flexible as last spring, when the club was near the top of the table, but it still has ample resources available to maintain the quality of its roster and add outside talent. At the moment, after all, only seven of its current players are headed for unrestricted free agency, with defensive linemen Khyiris Tonga and K’Lavon Chaisson as well as safety Jaylinn Hawkins the most prominent names on the list.",

When I felt him, I’m just too big, too strong, too technical on the ground. I’d like to get active this year. Neil Magny, nothing but respect … but I’d love to punch you in the head.”\n\nPrior to the finish, Micallef started strong with a good counter punch that clipped Elliott and put him down on the canvas briefly. But Elliott survived and forged a comeback with some solid striking combinations including a shot that opened a cut over Micaellef’s eye.\n\nElliott continued pressing forward and it looked like the momentum was shifting in his favor until he ended up on the ground with Micaellef on his back. While Elliott defended the submission immediately, Micallef slyly secured the choke with his hand behind the head, which made it almost impossible to break his grip.\n\nWhile he didn’t tap out, Elliott went to sleep with the fight ending in the second round.\n\nNow 2-0 in the UFC, Micaellef seems like a prospect worth watching and he’ll look to build on this latest win when he returns later in 2026.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch is shown to have been connected to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to newly released emails, per The Athletic.\n\nTisch is said to have received “scouting reports” on women from Epstein. The reports assessed whether they were “pro or civilian” or a “working girl.”\n\nThe emails are reported to have been sent in 2013 and were made public as part of the latest batch of more than 3 million Epstein-related documents released by the Department of Justice on Friday, Jan. 30.\n\nHere is what we know about Tisch’s connection to Epstein.\n\nTisch is an American film producer and businessman. He was born on February 14, 1949, and is 76 years old. Tisch's biggest movie was 1983's \"Risky Business,\" which he helped produce and in which Tom Cruise starred. He was also a producer on \"Forrest Gump,\" \"American History X,\" and \"Snatch,\" all of which received critical acclaim.\n\nTisch is the son of former Giants co-owner Preston Robert Tisch. He now serves as the chairman, co-owner and executive vice president of the Giants. Tisch is the only person in history to have earned a Golden Globe, Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy nomination and a Super Bowl ring.\n\nTisch's name appears more than 440 times in the 3 million released documents, per ESPN. The emails concerning Tisch range from the \"mundane\" to more profane. Most of them refer to Tisch setting up \"dates\" with women through Epstein. There is not enough information available to determine whether any legal issues exist at this time.\n\nHours after the publication of The Athletic's story on the emails, the New York Giants provided a statement from Tisch acknowledging the existence of some emails about adult women. Tisch denied that anything further happened, however.\n\n\"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.”\n\nThe NFL has not yet issued a statement on the situation.\n\nThe first email released so far was from May 2013. According to The Athletic's report, Epstein emailed Tisch, who said he was still in an NFL meeting. Once Tisch was free, Epstein suggested a Russian woman could meet, and Tisch immediately replied, asking if she was “fun.”\n\nThe next email is from June 2013. Tisch reached out asking about a specific woman, Epstein responded, \"(Tahitian) speaks mostly french exotic.\" Tisch asked if she was a working girl, and Epstein responded, \"Never.\"\n\nLater in June, Tisch emailed Epstein, \"Is my present in NYC?\" Epstein replied \"Yes\" to which Tisch asked the next morning, \"Can I get my surprise to take me to lunch tomorrow?”\n\nEpstein reached out to Tisch in another exchange, \"Did you contact the great a-- fake tit (name redacted) she’s a character, short term, has an older boyfriend going to acting school, a 10 a--.” Tisch responded, \"Thanks Jeffrey. Curious to know about (name redacted). I will contact (name redacted) … pro or civilian?” Epstein responded, \"civilian, but Russian, and rarely tells the full truth, but fun.”\n\nEpstein later followed up with Tisch after he'd connected with one of the women and let him know, \"report just in, you did very well, she wants to go to the play, she is a little freaked by the age difference but go slow … i will try to convince her not to return to Ukraine. having her crying worked.” Tisch replied, \"Nice report … Funny comment on crying!!!”\n\nPer The Athletic, other emails are between Epstein and women about Tisch. One referenced that the producer would be able to get her in movies saying, \"Gonna meet Steve Tisch next week for a dinner, He said that he gonna work on 3 movies starting June. So I’ll ask if I can read scripts and maybe audition for some part.”.\n\nIn September 2013, according to The Athletic, Tisch offered Epstein two tickets to Giants games, and to other games. Epstein is shown having offered Tisch to visit the private island in the Caribbean, but it is not clear whether Tisch took him up on the offer ever.\n\nAnother email touched on the subject the duo's relationship. Epstein and Tisch were discussing a date Tisch had been on and Epstein wrote, \"I am happy to have you as a new but … shared interest friend.”\n\nTim Mara helped found the Giants in 1925. He then passed the team to Jack Mara and Wellington Mara, who became co-owners in 1939. Tim J. Mara became a co-owner in 1965 and held a stake in the team until 1990. The following year, Bob Tisch took his place as co-owner.\n\nWellington Mara and Bob Tisch were co-owners through 2004. In 2005, the current co-owners, John Mara and Steve Tisch, took over. The pair has served as co-owners of the franchise for the past 20 years.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid are hoping to keep up their strong recent form in La Liga when they host Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. Barcelona’s victory over Elche on Saturday means Los Blancos trail by four points in the La Liga title, but a win of their own would see this cut back down to one.\n\nAs per Diario AS, head coach Alvaro Arbeloa looked ahead to the match against Rayo, which he expects to be tough.\n\n“It’s very important and fundamental, for our aspirations in La Liga, to be able to win tomorrow. Rayo is always a very uncomfortable, pressing, aggressive team. Everyone knows their identity and the difficulty it is going to put on us. We are very focused on going out to give our maximum level to win the three points.”\n\nArbeloa was asked about whether he considers Thibaut Courtois, Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham, Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior to be “untouchable”, with them having played every minute of Real Madrid’s last four matches (vs Levante, AS Monaco, Villarreal and Benfica).\n\n“I understand football debates, but I always want to have the best on the pitch. And the more minutes they can be for me, at the team’s disposal, the better. We saw it, for example, in Villarreal. With 2 minutes to go, in stoppage time, Mbappe’s goal comes from a very good action by Vinicius, who goes inside, turns the game around, finds Mbappe and is awarded a penalty.\n\n“They are players capable of unbalancing a game at any minute. And well, because there will be people who are not Real Madrid fans who do not want them to be on the field. I imagine that what Real Madrid fans want is for their best players to always be available, always on the pitch. The five you said… they are players who can be in the top ten, worldwide. So they have my full confidence. And it’s not that it’s my confidence, but it’s their performance that puts them on the pitch.”\n\nIn the lead-up to Sunday’s match, there are murmurs of more fan discontent being displayed at the Bernabeu, as has been the cases in recent weeks. However, Arbeloa expects the Real Madrid support to be behind the team against Rayo.\n\n“I expect a Bernabeu that is with the team, as it was in the last home game. And how they know we need. I will always ask for their support at the Bernabeu, because with them we are much stronger. They know that our objective, obviously, is to win on Sunday; to continue in the fight for La Liga, one for which we are fighting… very strongly, with a lot of desire. And if we want to stay there, we need them. They are very aware. The Monaco match showed what we are capable of when we are united; the confidence they give to the players. And that with them, together with us, everything is much easier.”",

    "description": "Brooks Koepka is understandably frustrated with his putting while losing more than six strokes to the feild on the greens in the Farmers Insurance Open",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — In a round that he'd put plenty of circles and squares on his scorecard, Brooks Koepka had a strong chance to head for the locker room feeling decent about his Saturday in the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open. After starting on the 10th hole of Torrey Pines' South course, he was only 55 feet from the cup after two shots at his closing hole, the par-5 ninth. He was pitching for eagle.\n\nThat Koepka walked away with a bogey 6 said a lot about how much he struggled with his putter. He had only 39 inches left to make birdie but ended up three-putting from there to finish with a one-over-par 73 that put him in a tie for 61st place, 19 shots behind leader Justin Rose.\n\nThere was another flat stick disaster and a double bogey at the par-3 11th, with Koepka three-putting by missing an initial four-foot putt that rolled 10 feet past the hole. He then misfired on that.\n\nFor those who made it to the weekend at Torrey Pines, Koepka ranks second-to-last for the tournament in strokes gained/putting, losing 6.19 to the field. On Saturday alone, he lost nearly 5½ shots on the greens.\n\nThe five-time major winner was asked after the round if he had hope for fixing his putting issues at next week’s WM Phoenix Open. “It can’t get worse, right?” he said.\n\n“Game feels good. I think putting is probably last in the field, but never really putted well here. Don't know the answer to it right now. I'll probably try to figure that out when I'm done with you guys. But I'm very happy with everything. Seems to be lining up, so I'm very pleased.”\n\nAmong the possible reasons that Koepka’s West Coast Swing appearances were infrequent before he left for LIV Golf 3½ years ago is that he is a Floridian who grew up on Bermuda grass that is far different than the spongy Poa annua in the West that tracks up easier while growing tiny buds as the day goes on.\n\n“I've never felt comfortable on Poa,” Koepka said. “You just miss a few and you've got zero confidence. … Today, I felt every three-, four-footer was slightly downhill, and I felt like it kind of went a little bit of both ways. I tried to firm 'em all and take the break out to still be aggressive like I normally am. But I wasn't even hitting the hole.”\n\nKoepka refused to blame the conditions of the putting surfaces.\n\n“These greens are actually really, really good,” he said. “It has nothing to do with the greens; it's all me.”",

    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings went big in free agency last year to bolster the interior defensive line, but fast-forward a year, and it’s still an area the team needs to address.\n\nThe Vikings desperately needed to add some pass rush to their IDL for the 2025 season. They did so by signing a couple of aging veterans on the back of injury hits and down seasons, in the form of Javon Hargrave and Jonathan Allen. Both players had their moments but also struggled, and ultimately signing both to big contracts doesn’t look like a great decision. Minnesota probably has to move on from at least one of them to make savings against the salary cap.\n\nFormer Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah also made the surprising move to trade away starting nose tackle Harrison Phillips before the 2025 season began. His absence left the Vikings’ run defense floundering at times last season.\n\nThe good news was that Jalen Redmond truly emerged as one of the Vikings’ best defensive players, showing ability in run defense and pass rushing. He should now be the pillar to build the rest of the team’s defensive line around.\n\nThe Vikings have some decent depth players at IDL, including Levi Drake Rodriguez, Tyrion Ingram-Dawkins, and Taki Taimani. Unless one of those shows incredible progression, they may stay as depth pieces, while the Vikings will have to look at replacing Hargrave and Allen — both at 30+, they were never long-term solutions.\n\nThe best way to find a long-term solution is through the draft, and I certainly wouldn’t rule out Minnesota using an early draft pick to address this area of the team. If Clemson’s Peter Woods slid down the board, he would be a great option.\n\nOther interior defenders that are receiving first-round buzz include Caleb Banks and Kayden McDonald — the latter was sent to Minnesota in Pro Football Focus’ latest mock draft. Alternatively, new general manager Rob Brzezinski could use one of his three Day 2 draft picks to address the position.\n\nThe Vikings could also look to bring in another, preferably younger, veteran into the mix. Once again, looking to free agency, although there’s not a great deal of quality at a young age available. Levi Onwuzirike is perhaps the standout candidate. Or they could look to trade for Daron Payne, a player who could be available.\n\nWhatever happens over the next few months, I would expect there to be some turnaround on the Vikings’ defensive line. Preferably, it will involve getting younger and more talented.",

    "fullText": "Anfield was silenced as Anthony Gordon looked to the Kop and defiantly pointed to his ear.\n\nThe Newcastle United forward had just fired his side in front against Liverpool with a well-taken 36th-minute finish.\n\nBut were Liverpool about to finally lose a top-flight fixture against the visitors on their own turf for the first time since 1994?\n\nWas the champions' winless run in the Premier League about to extend to six games?\n\nNot if Hugo Ekitike had anything to do with it.\n\nThe France forward dragged his side level with a poacher's finish - then fired them in front with a quick-fire second before half-time, much to the delight of manager Arne Slot.\n\n\"The fans love him,\" Slot said after his side's 4-1 win. \"From the start, everyone could see how special he is, how fast he is.\"\n\nThese were the sort of finishes Newcastle's scouting team had seen plenty of, having tried to sign Ekitike, 23, on three separate occasions - including last summer.\n\nEven head coach Eddie Howe could not help but hold his hands up.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to acknowledge the player against you while also acknowledging we could have defended better,\" he said.\n\n\"Ekitike is an outstanding player and you saw that today. He's got a little bit of everything and that's his biggest strength. He's tall, quick and he can finish.\"\n\nEkitike scores twice as Liverpool beat Newcastle\n\nThere is no doubt that Ekitike can finish.\n\nHe has already scored 15 goals for Liverpool and such an immediate return will not come as a shock to Newcastle, who always thought the striker would thrive in the Premier League.\n\nEkitike was just 19 and a relative unknown in this country when Newcastle first tried to sign him from Reims in 2022.\n\nThe striker had \"a lot of respect\" for the Magpies, but did not feel the timing was right to leave mid-season.\n\nHowever, when Newcastle came calling again, a few months later, he opted to join Paris St-Germain before later moving on to Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nNewcastle hoped it would be a case of third time lucky last summer, but it was Liverpool who won the race - before also signing Alexander Isak from the Magpies - much to the anguish of club legend Shay Given.\n\n\"It hurts me from a Newcastle point of view,\" the former goalkeeper told Match of the Day. \"[Ekitike] could be wearing a black-and-white shirt.\n\n\"He is brilliant at stretching defences. He has picked Liverpool and of all the signings they did make in the summer, he has been the standout.\"\n\nThis was a night when Ekitike became the youngest player to reach double figures for Liverpool in a league season since Michael Owen in 2000-01.\n\nBut it was a performance which earned him comparisons with another lethal striker from the club's recent past - Fernando Torres.\n\nEkitike's second goal was a case in point. It was almost a carbon copy of Torres' first goal for Liverpool, against Chelsea in 2007.\n\nThe Frenchman latched on to Milos Kerkez's ball down the left channel, drove past Malick Thiaw and finished clinically.\n\nAnd the similarity certainly did not go unnoticed by the watching Steven Gerrard, who set up Torres against the Blues.\n\n\"It is all about Hugo Ekitike running the channel,\" he told TNT Sports. \"It is Torres-like.\n\n\"He gets it out of his feet and that toe-poke... He reminds me of Torres every time I watch him.\"\n\nGerrard forged a deadly partnership with Torres between 2007 and 2011 - and Florian Wirtz and Ekitike are starting to strike up a similar understanding.\n\nThe pair have become friends off the field and it is showing on it, with Wirtz and Ekitike having combined for six goals in all competitions - more than any other Premier League duo.\n\n\"Hugo was scoring a lot of goals from the start of the season and Florian was involved a lot in creating chances for his team-mates and was unlucky that balls did not go in,\" Slot added.\n\n\"It was not always possible to play them together every three days. That is what I mean when I speak about off the ball and match fitness - to be able to play every three days.\n\n\"That took a while for them to play at the best of their level at the highest intensity every three days. They are getting closer and closer, and it is no surprise the numbers are going up.\"\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

It's not what I expected.\"\n\nDrewitt-Barlow grew up on a council estate in Manchester before moving to Essex and making a fortune in property.\n\nAcquiring Maldon and Tiptree FC in February 2025 marked his latest business venture.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow quickly oversaw the signing of some big names, including ex-West Ham United striker Freddie Sears and and the Zimbabwe international and former Colchester United, Leyton Orient and Southend United attacker Macauley Bonne.\n\nKevin Horlock, who once played for Manchester City, West Ham and Ipswich Town, was brought in as manager.\n\nThe arrivals made waves in the local football scene, as the Isthmian League North side, founded in 1946, are in the eighth tier of English football.\n\nIt was all the same to Drewitt-Barlow though.\n\nHe says: \"As a novice, you look at football and you see these crazy salaries from these big Premier League people - £300,000 a week – and it's not like that in this league.\n\n\"A lot of people still work regular jobs, this is a part-time thing for them.\n\n\"I didn't realise that kind of thing happened. I thought if you were a footballer, you're a footballer - you weren't a black cab driver or a roofer as well.\n\n\"But people have real lives and real jobs, that was the hardest thing for me to work out.\"\n\nAnother reality check for Drewitt-Barlow, who lives in Danbury, Essex, was the FA Cup.\n\nA series of impressive wins surged the Jammers into the first round proper of the prestigious English tournament.\n\nThere they faced Port Vale: a League One side who were 99 places above them in the footballing pyramid.\n\nWhat happened during the lead-up to the match quickly changed Drewitt-Barlow's entire outlook on the game.\n\n\"I'd heard about the FA Cup but I didn't understand the importance of it,\" he explains.\n\n\"I agreed with the FA to let the cup come here for an evening and I tell you now, the queues were round the block, down the street, for people to come in and see a piece of tin.\n\n\"It's like what the hell, people are actually that interested in this cup? Well, oh my God, they were.\n\n\"They were literally queuing, grown guys with their kids, waiting outside to come in and have a photograph taken with the FA Cup.\n\n\"Honestly, we felt the magic that night,\" he adds.\n\nIt was not just the excitement that Drewitt-Barlow, now club chief executive, was surprised by - it was the cash too.\n\nThe Jammers' match was chosen for TV coverage, earning them what he said was about £100,000.\n\nThe club also took half of the money earned on the gate, of which there were 4,551 fans in attendance, and won £15,800 in prize money for making it to the first round.\n\n\"I felt like all our Christmases came together with that FA Cup run,\" Drewitt-Barlow adds.\n\nEven before the match, which Maldon and Tiptree went on to lose 5-1, people were already talking about the businessman - who had been filmed during the cup draw.\n\n\"When it was announced on the TV I was like, 'Where the hell is Port Vale?',\" he recalls.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow has embraced becoming the pantomime villain on the terraces, but being targeted for his sexuality is where he draws the line.\n\n\"It's difficult on the terraces still,\" he says. \"That's where the bite comes from.\"\n\n\"There's still a massive stigma about being gay in football, but as time goes on those boundaries should break down.\n\n\"I don't mind being the whipping boy. They can call me all the names under the sun, I really couldn't give a flying hoot.\"\n\nDrewitt-Barlow claims to have been approached by footballers - three of which he says are currently playing in the Premier League - who are hiding being gay.\n\nHe is happy to help, but insists he does not want to become \"the poster boy for gay footballing\".\n\n\"I've already been classed as the poster boy for gay parenting or surrogacy and it doesn't get anybody anywhere,\" he adds.\n\n\"I don't think people want to [come out] because they're scared about what might happen in the dressing room, as well as on the pitch.\n\n\"I think the only people that can truly help and make it more normalised are the leagues and the FA.\"\n\nAway from the terraces, Drewitt-Barlow has been kept busy with renovations.\n\nFrom the clubhouse to the changing rooms, he has led an expensive overhaul of the facilities, which he described as \"semi-derelict\" when he arrived.\n\nEven purchasing grass for each goalmouth set him back £40,000.\n\nIt is very much a family operation, with husband Scott and son Aspen also overseeing the project.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow says: \"It was unloved, the place was tired. It needed somebody to come in, give it some love and show it some attention - and that's exactly what we did.\"\n\nUnder his stewardship, he claims Maldon and Tiptree have gone from attracting 70 spectators to an average crowd of 800.\n\n\"There's a lot of players who want to come here now, big players,\" he boasts.\n\n\"I can't walk around Tesco now without somebody telling me who we should be employing as a footballer.\"\n\nThe chief executive wants to take his club, which is in second place, into the English Football League and is chasing back-to-back promotions.\n\nHe reveals half the squad are being paid full-time, while the other half remain part-time.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow believes his club is now sustainable and will end the year in profit, boosted by the launch of a BTEC sports course in September.\n\nBut does he feel tired after his first year in football?\n\n\"Honestly, it's given me a fresh lease of life, I feel regenerated. I can't believe I didn't do this sooner,\" Drewitt-Barlow says.\n\n\"People love football, I never got it before now. I just did not get what people saw in football.\n\n\"Now I get it, I totally get it.\"\n\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nZimbabwe's Bonne leaves Maldon & Tiptree\n\nJammers boss enjoying first FA Cup run\n\nProspective owners 'plan to rebuild club's ground'",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants have signed a three-time batting champion.\n\nThat may not have quite as much meaning in MLB eyes in 2026 as it would've in a bygone era, but it's still quite a cool thing.\n\nThis is, of course, about Luis Arraez.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Jorge Castillo, Arraez signed a one-year contract with the Giants on Saturday evening.\n\nMORE: How Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nArraez should have a good chance to play second base for the Giants, where it was previously set up as a position battle between Casey Schmitt and Tyler Fitzgerald.\n\nThe lefty with a short swing is a career .317 hitter at the MLB level and is going to turn 29 in April.\n\nArraez played the last season and a half for the San Diego Padres, so he moves over to another NL West team.\n\nHe was a batting champion for the first time in 2022 with the Minnesota Twins when he hit .316.\n\nHe was then at .354 for the Miami Marlins in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, he began the season with the Marlins but finished with the Padres and batted .314, his third batting championship, won with three different teams.\n\nArraez has walked more times in his MLB career than he has struck out (and he doesn't walk very much).\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nThe downside with Arraez is that he doesn't have much power, but he actually has a .777 career OPS. That was .719 in 2025.\n\nHe won't set the world on fire, but he also puts the ball in play practically every time he steps into the box, and for those who enjoy a guy who hits the ball where it's pitched and has a short, level swing, Arraez will be fun to watch.\n\nIt's not a big investment for the Giants, so it's a worthwhile addition to have some steadiness in the lineup for San Francisco.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nOlympic skier Lindsey Vonn’s status for the Winter Olympics is uncertain. While competing in her final downhill event before the upcoming world competition, Vonn crashed on the course and had to be airlifted to a nearby facility for treatment.\n\nThe skier lost control while attempting to land a jump during a World Cup downhill event, becoming tangled in the safety nets lining the course. When Vonn was able to get up, she was limping and favoring her left knee, using her poles to steady herself.\n\nHere are the latest injury updates for Vonn following her crash while preparing for the Winter Olympics.\n\nMORE: When do the Winter Olympics start\n\nVonn released a statement on her Instagram. She said, \"I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams. This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics...but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback. My Olympic dream is not over. I will give more information when I have it. It's not over until it's over.\"\n\nVonn, as expected, did not race in Saturday's Super-G race. Her skiing coach, Chris Knight texted the Associated Presssaying that Vonn \"is preparing for Cortina as usual.\" Vonn herself posted on Instagram, announcing her withdrawal from the Super-G race and said that she is \"doing my best right now...\"\n\nThe U.S. Ski team also released a statement on Friday, backing up Vonn. \"Lindsey Vonn crashed in today's Cras Montana World Cup downhill and injured her left knee, however her Olympic dream isn't over yet.\"\n\nVonn had been running the fastest time at the first checkpoint before her injury. She landed a jump off-balance, then lifted her left arm and pole to try to regain her balance, and tried to brake. This caused her to be spun around, and she ended up in the nets.\n\nReports suggest that Vonn had an \"anxious expression\" and had a long embrace with teammate Jacquelin Wiles before going into the medical tent for treatment.\n\nMORE: Why were \"Heated Rivalry\" stars chosen as Winter Olympic torchbearers?\n\nVonn was competing in her final downhill competition before the Winter Olympics. She had gone over a jump, but didn't land correctly. Vonn was trying to regain her balance, but ended up spinning out and sliding down the course. Unable to control herself, she slid hard into the protective netting in what looked like a bad crash.\n\nWishing Lindsey Vonn a speedy recovery following her crash in Crans-Montana ❤️ pic.twitter.com/hZ6PcPVvW3\n\n— TNT Sports (@tntsports) January 30, 2026\n\nAfter being checked by medical personnel, Vonn was airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\nHere is video confirmation of Lindsey Vonn being airlifted to the hospital after her crash.\n\nHeartbreaking. #FISAlpine | #WorldCupCransMontanapic.twitter.com/Ck2oNc9lff\n\n— Team USA Olympics Updates and Coverage (@TeamUSAOLYCov) January 30, 2026\n\nVonn was also not the only one to crash. Three different competitors crashed, including Vonn.  Austria's Nine Ortlieb and Norway's Marte Monsen also crashed. Ortlieb crashed in the same area as Vonn, and Monsen nearly made it to the end before crashing into the nets and had to be taken away in a sled.\n\nFrench skier Romaine Miradoli completed her run, but said that the snow falling caused bad visibility issues. She said, \"You can't see, and it's bumpy everywhere.\" When pressed further and asked if the course was dangerous, Miradoli responded, \"We just couldn't see well.\"\n\nThe event was cancelled after Vonn's crash, per the AP.\n\nMORE: Biggest snubs from Team USA winter Olympic hockey team\n\nVonn was checked by the onsite medical team, but further evaluation was needed, especially given her knee favoring. Due to winter conditions and snow, she was airlifted to a nearby hospital.\n\nMORE: Meet the USA Olympic figure skating team for the Winter Olympics\n\nThe International Ski and Snowboard Federation CEO Urs Lehmann told reporters, \"I know she hurt her knee, I talked to her. I don’t know if it’s really heavy and (if) she won’t miss the Olympics. Let’s wait for what the doctors are saying.”\n\nVonn's first scheduled event is the women's downhill on February 8.\n\nMORE: Biggest snubs from Team Canada's Winter Olympic team\n\nThe opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics are set for Friday, February 6.

Apparently there’s some sort of hatred for Micallef that carried over into the cage and fueled Elliott to jump out to a strong lead. Micallef just wasn’t able to get going on the feet and resembled little of what he looked like in his UFC debut nearly one year ago.\n\nThings kept going wrong for Micallef in the second round as Elliott’s hands starting landing more often. Elliott eventually hurt Micallef on the feet and could have gone for a knockout finish. Instead, he decided to stay in the clinch along the cage, which allowed Micallef the chance to reverse and score a nice takedown. From there, Micallef quickly locked up a tight rear-naked choke and eventually put Elliott to sleep.\n\nCheck out the video highlights below:\n\nJUST LIKE THAT 💥\n\nJonathan Micallef gets the submission victory in round two! #UFC325\n\n[ LIVE on @ParamountPlus ] pic.twitter.com/m9QX7dEu2I\n\nFor complete UFC 325 results, coverage, and highlights click HERE.",

The number of players leaving reportedly ranked among the top of all of college football, according to On3.\n\nAmong all teams in college football, Michigan State was No. 7 in total player departures with 37 players leaving via the transfer portal. Michigan State was No. 2 among Big Ten teams, behind only Penn State who ranked No. 3 nationally, with 46 players departing via the portal.\n\nAs expected with any coaching change, we saw a large number of Spartans leave from this past year's team. This included both high-level players such as wide receiver Nick Marsh, running back Makhi Frazier and quarterback Aidan Chiles, and also a lot of backups and reserves. Ultimately, we will not know until the fall if Michigan State is better or worse off with the players that have left and been replaced by incoming transfer portal additions. But, this high number of players leaving the program through the portal is something that at least is noteworthy and interesting to see.\n\nClick on the post below to see the complete rankings of teams with the most players leaving through the transfer portal from On3:\n\nNEW: Schools with the most College Football Transfer Portal departures🔁https://t.co/lbDS9V8lFd pic.twitter.com/DZrnqLIDi1\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "For the second straight year, the Detroit Lions will send six players to the 2026 Pro Bowl Games, which will be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, Calif., on Feb. 3. Coverage of the annual event will begin on ESPN at 6:30 p.m. ET, with the flag game at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nAs the NFL's top talents assemble in the Bay Area this weekend, let's meet the six Lions representatives:\n\nAfter a breakout campaign in his third NFL season out of Iowa, Campbell earned his first Pro Bowl selection and first All-Pro honor.\n\nThe former Hawkeye star led the Lions with 176 tackles (89 solo, 87 assisted), which is the second-most in the league behind Miami's Jordyn Brooks. Campbell also recorded 5 sacks, 4 passes defended, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 fumble recoveries.\n\nCampbell is also the first Lions linebacker to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Stephen Boyd's distinction in 2000.\n\nAppearing in his third Pro Bowl in his third season, Gibbs joins Barry Sanders and Billy Sims as the only running backs in team history to earn at least three Pro Bowl berths in the Super Bowl era.\n\nThis season, the former Crimson Tide icon ranked seventh league-wide in total yards, with 1,223 yards on 243 carries and 13 touchdowns, while catching 77 passes for 616 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nReplacing Seattle's Super Bowl-bound quarterback Sam Darnold, the 2025 Pro Bowl Games Offensive MVP will make his fifth Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nGoff completed 393-of-578 passes to finish second league-wide in yards (4,564) and touchdowns (34).\n\nDespite operating under a new offensive coordinator this season, he became the sixth quarterback in NFL history to produce 4,000 passing yards and 30 touchdowns in three consecutive campaigns.\n\nHutchinson earned the second Pro Bowl selection of his career after setting career highs in sacks, tackles, and forced fumbles, finishing with 14.5 sacks, 54 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 4 forced fumbles, 3 passes defended, and 1 interception.\n\nHutchinson also led the league with 100 pressures, and his 91.9 overall grade from PFF ranked fourth among edge rushers. He became the first player in franchise history to log multiple 10.0-sack seasons through the first four years of his career.\n\nIn addition to the Pro Bowl nod, Hutchinson was named a finalist for the 2025 Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year and 2025 Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAppearing in his fourth straight Pro Bowl in his five-year career, Penei Sewell will once again compete in the NFL's premier all-star event.\n\nHis 95.2 overall grade and 96.8 run-block grade from PFF led all offensive linemen this season, which stems from the former Oregon star allowing just one sack and six quarterback hits this year.\n\nSewell was named a finalist for the NFL's inaugural Protector of the Year Award in 2025 and joins Lou Creekmur and Lomas Brown as the only Lions tackles to earn at least four Pro Bowl berths in their career.\n\nSt. Brown, who has positioned himself amongst the NFL's elite wide receivers, earned his fourth straight Pro Bowl selection after recording 117 receptions for 1,401 yards and 11 touchdowns this season.\n\nThis past season, the USC product became the fourth player in NFL history to top 100 receptions and 10 touchdown receptions in three consecutive seasons.\n\nSt. Brown now joins Calvin Johnson and Herman Moore as the only wide receivers in team history to earn at least four Pro Bowl berths.\n\nFor more Lions coverage,  Follow Scout on X: @SpringgateNews\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lions Wire: Which Detroit Lions are participating in the 2026 Pro Bowl?",

    "title": "No. 16 Maryland women’s basketball collapses late against Oregon, 68-61",
    "description": "The Terps have now lost four straight contests.",
    "fullText": "No. 16 Maryland women’s basketball looked to be in the driver’s seat heading into the fourth quarter Saturday night at Xfinity Center.\n\nThe Terps led Oregon by six and had momentum after a big layup by Oluchi Okananwa, who had exploded for 27 points through three quarters. They looked on track to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\nBut for the second straight game, Maryland collapsed late. The Ducks shot 8-of-12 in the fourth quarter to rally for a 68-61 win over the Terps.\n\nWhat first appeared to be a rough stretch for the Terps has turned disastrous. Their four-game losing streak is tied for the longest in head coach Brenda Frese’s illustrious tenure.\n\nMaryland has now lost five of their last six games, and it ends a three-game homestand winless.\n\n“We’re all disappointed, frustrated to not close out three really close, tough games, especially at home,” Frese said. “We’re competing. We’re right there. Possessions are close. We just continue to see it’s a 40-minute game, and impactful possessions matter.”\n\nThe Terps scored just four points in the first eight minutes of the final frame, and that gave the Ducks a chance to go on a run.\n\nPerimeter shooting was the difference in the end. The Terps fell cold and shot 0-of-6. The Ducks found fire and made three consecutive 3-pointers to take a lead that they never gave up.\n\n“Oregon in the second half just came out with fresher legs, better depth made three [3-pointers] there in the fourth quarter that separated them,” Frese said. “No one’s going to feel sorry for us.”\n\nEarly in the season, Maryland’s defense looked to have drastically improved from previous years. But that trend has been bucked in Big Ten play, where the Terps have continually allowed elite individual performances.\n\nEhis Etute was the benefactor of that Saturday. The sophomore exploded for 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting — her first 20-point game in college — and outmatched the Terps’ bigs in the paint.\n\nEtute had her way with Isimenme Ozzy-Momodu offensively, forcing her into foul trouble. Etute only stands at an even six feet tall, but she still had a size advantage.\n\nMaryland needed a similar performance from its brightest star, Okananwa. She had struggled in the first two legs of the Terps’ homestand.\n\nEarly on, Okananwa found a burst — she notched Maryland’s first nine points. But Addi Mack was the only other Terp to score in the frame, and Okananwa went scoreless herself for the final 7:49 of the first quarter.\n\nThe lack of offense outside of the junior in the opening frame put the Terps into a hole — one that Okananwa then had to dig them out of. She was a lights-out 6-of-7 from the field in the second quarter.\n\nAfter scoring a combined 20 points in Maryland’s previous two games, she finished the first half with 23 — over 60% of the Terps’ first-half scoring.\n\nThe Terps trailed by as much as eight in the second quarter, but a 14-0 run gave them a six-point halftime lead.\n\nIn the second half Ducks adjusted their defensive approach on Okananwa; she wasn’t nearly as impactful.\n\nAt the same time, important contributors in Yarden Garzon and Saylor Poffenbarger were unproductive offensively. Garzon made one 3-pointer and finished with three points. Poffenbarger was impactful, just not offensively. She had two points and eight rebounds.\n\nThe Terps found most of their success down low as their struggles from beyond the arc continued; just two of their 15 3-point attempts on the night went in. Garzon in particular is Maryland’s best deep ball shooter, and she took just two attempts from beyond the arc — one of them was a desperation heave as time ran out.\n\nMaryland’s lineup has been depleted for the majority of Big Ten play, which does not help in games such as these. Saturday was yet another example of it failing to close out contests over the last month.\n\nAfter a strong start, Maryland’s season has reached a new low in Big Ten play, putting its status in the top-25 in jeopardy.\n\n1. Shot distribution. Mack and Okananwa combined for 38% of Maryland’s shot attempts on Saturday and 72.13% of its scoring. Maryland needed someone else to step up late in the game, but it seemed as though it had become too one-dimensional.\n\n“It’s just feeding the hot hand,” Okananwa said. “I was it for us early, and Addi was definitely it for us late. Just recognizing that as a team and wanting to get that person involved.”\n\n2. Mack had a strong supplementary game. Other than Okananwa, Maryland’s remaining offensive production was from Addi Mack. Mack scored 17 points on 5-of-17 shooting. Mack attacked the rim with relative success, facilitated well, was the primary ball-handler and dictated the offense’s pace.\n\n3. Breanna Williams added playing time. Frese tweaked her rotation from the team’s last few games. Breanna Williams hadn’t played against Iowa or Washington, but she played 16 minutes Saturday with Maryland desperately needing depth down low.\n\nBut Williams matched up with Etute for most of those 16 minutes. And Etute had a career night.\n\n“[Williams] gave us some really good spot minutes, within that. But, yeah, we tried to throw a lot of things at them defensively as well as offensively.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona and Real Madrid have done battle for a number of signings over the years, and the latest instalment is here. Both clubs are keen to strengthen their respective B teams, and they have set their sights on the same player: Sergio Martinez.\n\nBarcelona registered their interest in Martinez earlier in the month, and on that occasion, they were competing with Villarreal. They are now poised to face off against Real Madrid, who have also been working on strengthening their youth categories in recent months.\n\nAs per Diario AS, Barcelona and Real Madrid have both made offers to Racing de Santander for Martinez, who has lost prominence at the Segunda club in recent weeks. The idea of both is for a loan deal to be agreed with the inclusion of a buy option, although if necessary, they are prepared to secure a permanent deal outright.\n\nMartinez, who is only 18 years of age, is seen as a great promise, but with Barcelona and Real Madrid calling, it may be difficult for Racing to keep him. He’s a midfielder that can operate as a 6, 8 or 10, and this versatility is one of the reasons why the Clasico clubs are prepared to go head-to-head.\n\nThere are less than 48 hours remaining until the winter transfer window closes, so time is running out for Barcelona and Real Madrid to reach an agreement with Racing. Whoever does so first would have the advantage in this particular battle, although talks with the player could also be decisive.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Martinez ends up come Monday night. The fact that Castilla play in the league over Barca Atletic could mean that Real Madrid have the advantage, although Barcelona’s record with promoting younger players into the first team could mean that they are more favourable.",

    "description": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. has been one of the main players floating in trade rumors, but it seems that Brooklyn isn't giving him away.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. is in the midst of what could be his first season as an All-Star given how well he has played for the Nets this year. Brooklyn won its first game of the season without Porter in the lineup on Friday with their 109-99 win at the Utah Jazz and it's possible that fact could be influencing how they view trading the sharpshooting forward.\n\n\"I know everybody thinks that Porter's available, that would be news to me. I have not heard that he is available. If he is available, I'll wait for Shams [Charania] to tell me because I haven't heard that,\" NBA insider Brian Windhorst said on ESPN's NBA Today show. Windhorst was commenting on the fact that Porter is considered one of the best available candidates to be traded, but the recent reporting suggests the alternative.\n\nPorter, 27, is having the best season of his career as he's averaging 25.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game while shooting 48.2% from the field and 39.8% from three-point land in 38 appearances. Porter's value to the Nets is immense this season as Brooklyn is just 1-8 in the games in which he's unavailable and 12-26 in the games he's able to play in.\n\nPorter has been connected to various teams that are looking for an upgrade in their pursuit of a playoff run including the Golden State Warriors as it seems that he has made it onto their radar, according to NBA insider Chris Mannix. Mannix noted that the Warriors remain interested in Porter, echoing reporting from other insiders earlier in the season, Golden State would only pursue the former Denver Nuggets star if Brooklyn is willing to bring their price down on him.\n\nBased on various reports, it seems that the Nets want multiple first-round picks in any Porter trade, a price that Golden State is unwilling to pay given that they're trying to secure their future after franchise legends Stephen Curry and Draymond Green retire. Be that as it may, it appears that Brooklyn is more likely to keep Porter than they are to trade him prior to the Feb. 5 deadline.\n\nWindy on MPJ:\n\n\"I know everybody thinks that Porter's available, that would be news to me.

    "description": "The Cleveland Cavaliers may be about to make some minor, but necessary moves at the NBA Trade Deadline.",
    "fullText": "The 3 trades the Cleveland Cavaliers are being tied to currently originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStill, moves are expected to happen. Two of the biggest names that could be out the door by next Thursday include, but aren't limited to, Lonzo Ball and DeAndre Hunter. Right now, both men have seemingly worn out their welcome in Cleveland, and in order for the Cavs to get under the second apron comfortably, both men would likely have to be moved.\n\nLuckily for the Cavs, GM Mike Gansey has done a good job of building out some young players to make moves like this possible. The rise of Jaylon Tyson, the development of Craig Porter, and the unexpected boost that rookie Tyrese Proctor have given the Cavs this season have made Hunter and Ball expendable. Which is good, because neither man is going to fetch you that much back in a trade.\n\nIdeally, the Cavs trading Hunter and Ball away for nothing, or maybe a second-round pick in a future draft, would be ideal. That would get the Cavs under the second apron and allow them to make more moves in the future. Plus, the team has enough talent on its roster right now to try to contend without additional players coming back. These moves would also help the Cavs land LeBron James in the near future, assuming he wants to return to Cleveland to finish out his career.\n\nSo the trade rumors persist, and three of them have gotten the most traction, so let's look at them.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers acquire F DeAndre Hunter\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers acquire F Rui Hachimura and F Dalton Knecht\n\nAccording to Cleveland.com's Chris Fedor, this is a trade that's been talked about but doesn't seem to have much legs at the moment. The goal here is Knecht. Keeping Hachimura would be nice; he's a solid big man who can play a variety of positions, but his contract isn't appealing, and he doesn't offer much more than anyone on the Cavs roster currently. Sending Hachimura to a team like the Brooklyn Nets would be nice, as you as they can eat his salary, but that seems unlikely at the moment. Knecht makes it possible for the Cavs to move on from Max Strus in the offseason, saving the team even more money. That is, assuming Knecht can show some potential with the Cavs this season.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings acquire F DeAndre Hunter \nThe Cleveland Cavaliers acquire G Keon Ellis, G  Dennis Schroder, and Dario Saric.\n\nThe prior trade with the Lakers seems like a salary dump waiting to happen; this Kings trade seems like the opposite. While HoopsHype's Michael Scotto seems to believe that Ellis is the goal for the Cavs, they would be wise to consider keeping Schroder as well. The guard is everything the Cavs were hoping Lonzo Ball would be. He's a decent scorer still, and while not a stud by any means, he'd be a fine enough addition to the Cavs as a backup for Darius Garland. He's in the first year of a three-year deal that'll pay him between $14 and $15 million a year, so he may not be the guy you want to keep around past this season, but he could fill a need in the wake of the failure of Ball's trade if you don't trust Porter or Proctor yet.\n\nThe Washington Wizards get G Lonzo Ball\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers get TBD\n\nIt may not seem like much of a trade, but as reports have pointed out, Lonzo Ball is 460th in shooting percentage out of 450 eligible players. He's washed, and the thought of giving up Isaac Okoro for him in a trade makes some fans a little ill to this day. The Washington Wizards know that the Cavs wanna dump Ball's salary so that the Cavs have wiggle room for the trade deadline. So they're offering to take Ball off the Cavs ' hands, for a nominal fee. They want draft capital in return, according to HoopsHype Scotto. A fair offer, but it seems unlikely the Cavs would give up a first-round pick to get rid of Ball, so this could be a situation where Ball and two second-round picks head over to the Wizards for a second-round pick of their own. It's a bold move, but one that would get the Cavs closer to being under the second apron.",

The Tar Heels turned in an impressive performance after taking nearly a week off and coming off a much-needed road win over ranked Virginia. They turned the ball over only twice and scored 18 points off 14 forced turnovers.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from UNC’s win over Georgia Tech.\n\nCaleb Wilson delivered another standout performance in his second hometown visit, finishing with 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and 1-for-3 from 3-point range, along with four assists, four rebounds, a block and a steal. It marked his third straight game with at least 20 points and his sixth in the last eight\n\nJunior center Henri Veesaar and senior guard Seth Trimble also posted big games. Veesaar recorded another double-double, his 11th of the season, and remained tied with Wilson for the ACC lead in that category. He scored 20 points on 8-of-15 shooting with 12 rebounds and four blocks, while Trimble added 18 points on 8-of-14 shooting..\n\nLuka Bogavac scored 16 points off the bench, shooting six-for-10 from the field and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc. He continues his strong stretch from his last four outings. Forward Jarin Stevenson added seven points, six rebounds and two assists in 22 minutes off the bench.\n\nThe Tar Heels also shot an impressive 11-of-12 (91.6%) from the free-throw line, easily their best free-throw shooting game of the season. Veesaar and Wilson went to the line a combined six times, each making all three of his attempts.\n\nIn their last two games, the Tar Heels have made 26 of 34 free throws, a solid 76.4% from the line.

    "fullText": "In a matchup headlined by two of college basketball's protagonists this season, Kansas' 90-82 win over BYU had several of the top NBA minds and celebrities in the building.\n\nOne being Sam Presti. He was shown on the broadcast as Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa went at it. Peterson finished with 18 points and three rebounds in the Jayhawks' win. Dybantsa had 17 points. Both will likely go in the top three of the 2026 NBA draft.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder sit atop the NBA standings, but that doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels. The reigning NBA champions vie to go back-to-back. And even with a pedestrian month, most expect them to enter the playoffs as the favorite.\n\nRegardless of how this season plays out, the Thunder are due for some roster changes this upcoming offseason. It comes with the territory of professional sports. If they want to remain a title contender, they must figure out how to recast their supporting players.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams will soon make up most of OKC's payroll. All three will have humongous new contracts kick in soon. One way to remain one of the league's deepest teams is by adding talent through the draft.\n\nWhile OKC's own draft pick will be in the bottom 10, the Thunder have their hands stuck in several pots of gold. The big one is the LA Clippers' first-round swap rights. Even though they've bounced back and are near .500, you never know what could happen in the draft lottery.\n\nWe'll see how the rest of the season plays out. The Peterson and Dybantsa dream has likely been burst with LA's hot run. But Presti's attendance at Allen Fieldhouse shows how much of a must-watch game it was.\n\nLook who showed up to watch Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa pic.twitter.com/SmFJcSaIa0\n\n— Clemente Almanza (@CAlmanza1007) January 31, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on OKC Thunder Wire: Sam Presti attends to watch Darryn Peterson, AJ Dybantsa show",

Mikael Backlund’s slap shot missed the net, but the rebound caromed right back out front where Farbee knocked a backhand through Nedeljkovic’s pads.\n\nIt was Calgary’s first victory since trading defenseman Rasmus Andersson. The Flames had gone 0-3-2 and scored only seven goals since the deal.\n\nWolf, who is from Gilroy, California, improved to 16-2-2 against teams from his home state — the Sharks, Los Angeles Kings and Anaheim Ducks. He is 9-2-0 against San Jose.\n\nWhile recently acquired left wing Kiefer Sherwood (upper body) remains out, San Jose did welcome back left wing Philipp Kurashev (upper body, 19 games) and defenseman Shakir Mukhamadullin (undisclosed, 10 games).\n\nSherwood, acquired from Vancouver on Jan. 19, hasn’t played since Jan. 10, but he’s back skating with the team.\n\nSharks: Visit the Chicago Blackhawks on Monday.\n\nFlames: Host the Toronto Maple Leafs on Monday.\n\nAP NHL: https://apnews.com/hub/nhl",

    "fullText": "A Few Bad Apples? Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China\n\n Zhuang Liu, \n\n Wenwei Peng \n\n & Shaoda Wang \n\n Working Paper 34747\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34747\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nHonesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe thank Ying Bai, Yiming Cao, Yunchien Chang, Chiman Cheung, Ruben Durante, Ray Fisman, Edward Glaeser, Guojun He, Andrew Kao, Muhammad Yasir Khan, Jonathan Klick, James Kung, Bingjing Li, Vincent Pons, Jesse Shapiro, Uta Schoenberg, Michael Song, Yongxiang Wang, Jaya Wen, Yanhui Wu, David Y.

    "fullText": "Melena refers to black tarry stools, which usually occurs as a result of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nIt has a characteristic tarry colour and offensive smell, and is often difficult to flush away. The change to the stool consistency occurs due to the alteration and degradation of blood by intestinal enzymes, resulting in melena.\n\nIn this article, we shall look at the differential diagnosis, clinical features and investigations for melena.\n\nMelena usually occurs as a result of an upper gastrointestinal bleed, however can also occur from bleeding occurring in the small bowel (albeit rare)\n\nThere are a number of causes for upper GI bleeding, however the most common are peptic ulcer disease, variceal bleeding, and malignancy.\n\nPeptic ulcer disease is the most common cause of melena (Fig. 1). Whilst it can affect any patient group, it should be especially suspected in those with known active peptic ulcer disease, a recent history of NSAID use or steroid use, or known H. pylori infection\n\nClassically, the most significant bleeding will occur if an ulcer erodes through the posterior gastric wall into the gastroduodenal artery. However, in reality, extensive bleeding can occur with the erosion of any blood vessel.\n\nOesophageal varices refer to dilations of the porto-systemic anastomoses in the oesophagus. They most commonly occur due to portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis and are prone to rupture.\n\nThe most common underlying cause for oesophageal varices is alcoholic-related liver disease (ArLD), however can occur with any patient with chronic liver disease. Any melena occurring in a patient with a known chronic liver disease should be urgently investigated for potential variceal bleeding.\n\nUlcerating oesophageal or gastric malignancies (Fig. 2) can first present with melena, causing a gradual flow of blood that may present prior to any other cancer-associated symptoms.\n\nIn the assessment of any patient with melena, it is important to enquire about dysphagia, dyspepsia, weight loss, and relevant family history, potentially suggestive a diagnosis of malignancy.\n\nOther less common causes of melena include gastritis or oesophagitis, Meckel’s diverticulum, small bowel tumours, or vascular malformations (e.g. angiodysplasia).\n\nThe key facts to ascertain from a patient presenting with melena are:\n\nA digital rectal examination is essential to confirm the melena. A full abdominal examination must be performed, importantly to assess for peritonism, hepatomegaly, or stigmata of liver disease.\n\n*Patients on iron tablets will have black stool, so ensure to clarify the temporal sequence for any symptoms with the starting of iron tablets\n\nAll patients with suspected melena should undergo routine blood tests, including FBC, U&Es, LFTs, and clotting, to help investigate for underlying causes and to stratify overall risk.\n\nAny drop in haemoglobin and rise in the urea:creatinine ratio is very indicative of an upper GI bleed, as digested haemoglobin produces urea as a by-product and is readily absorbed by the intestine\n\nEnsure all patients with melena have a Group and Save performed, with those with any significant haemoglobin drop or haemodynamic instability having blood products cross-matched too.\n\nAll patients with new onset melena must undergo a gastroscopy (OGD) for further assessment. This will not only potentially identify the cause of melena, but also can allow for definitive interventions in certain cases (e.g. banding of varices)\n\nThe urgency by which an OGD is performed should be determined by the patients Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score (GBS), used to risk stratify patients based purely on clinical and biochemical parameters.\n\nHowever, in certain cases, OGD may be inconclusive and therefore in those with ongoing melena, further investigations are required:\n\nIn the rare scenario that the above investigations are all normal, capsule endoscopy or RBC Scintigraphy may be considered for further investigations.\n\nIn any critically unwell patient, an A to E approach should be used to stabilise the patient prior to any definitive management steps.\n\nBlood products should be transfused to those who are haemodynamically unstable (urgently) or with a low haemoglobin. Any deranged coagulation should be corrected as appropriate, which may include use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) +/- platelets, especially for those with impaired liver function.\n\nThe underlying cause identified will determine the necessary management option:\n\nYou’ve made a great start.

    "description": "Insiders reveal how Larry Ellison’s money turned Blair’s institute into a tech sales and lobbying operation for Oracle",
    "fullText": "After leaving office, Tony Blair founded such a flurry of initiatives, from charitable foundations to paid consultancies, that it’s been hard to bring the big one into focus. The Tony Blair Institute of Global Change (TBI) dwarfs the other work, just as it towers over other UK-based think tanks.\n\nMuch of the reporting on it has focused on Blair himself, ever newsworthy, his Davos lifestyle and meetings with the world’s rich and powerful. But the TBI isn’t just a UK concern, it’s now a global force working in at least 45 countries, employing other former heads of state, ex ministers and civil servants and paying more than a million dollars to its top earners.\n\nWhile previous Blair vehicles ranged around from development and peacebuilding to reputational work for petro-states, the TBI has an overwhelming focus: technology.\n\nThe ex-premier’s trademark evangelism is now focused on AI, its power to transform government –with his Institute now going as far as to try to build its own AI tools to sell to Gulf states– and why everyone should listen to Larry Ellison, the founder of technology firm Oracle.\n\nWhile the institute relies on Blair’s political brand, its money comes, in large part, from Ellison, who has had a remarkable 2025. He was briefly the richest man in the world in September, as Oracle’s stake in AI infrastructure drove its share price into orbit. In the 1990s Ellison was known as “the man who would be Gates” as he battled the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, for pre-eminence. This year, the 81 year old has been feted by US President Donald Trump as the “CEO of everything” and an essay in the New York Times called him the billionaire “who will soon own the news” as his family’s media interests in Paramount-Sky Dance seem set to expand to include Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nEllison invested $130 million in the TBI between 2021 and 2023, with a further $218 million pledged since then. The scale of funding took the TBI from a headcount of 200 to approaching 1,000. Blair himself takes no salary from TBI but over this time the institute has been able to recruit from bluechip firms like McKinsey and Silicon Valley giants Meta. In 2018 before the Oracle founder’s funding surge, TBI’s best-paid director earned $400,000. In 2023, the last year where accounts are available, the top earner took home $1.26 million.\n\nBlair and Ellison have a relationship that goes back to the former’s time in office. In 2003 Ellison and Blair, then in his pomp, had a photo opportunity at Downing Street to mark a gift of supplies to 40 specialist schools. In tech circles this is known as “land and expand”. Oracle has since been contracted hundreds of times by the British government and earned £1.1 billion in public sector revenue since the start of 2022, according to data collected by procurement analysts Tussell.\n\nThe full extent of Ellison funding for the TBI became clear from the institute’s own accounts and a survey of US non-profit financial data, including that of the Larry Ellison Foundation, through which major donations were made to both the TBI and the Tony Blair Foundation.\n\nLighthouse Reports and UK partner Democracy for Sale then spent four months interviewing 29 current and former TBI staff, most on condition of anonymity, to build an insider account of the institute. This work included conversations with over a dozen former TBI employees who advised or drew up policy recommendations for governments across nine countries in the Global South and revealed how their work ranged from explicitly promoting Oracle’s services and acting as a “sales engine” to recommending tech solutions that are potentially harmful or bizarrely divorced from local realities. Former staff described a symbiotic relationship between TBI and Oracle, with the two entities holding joint retreats, and one ex-employee characterising them as “inseparable”.\n\nThis testimony was supported by public documents and those obtained under the UK’s freedom of information laws. Matched with interviews, they revealed an organisation unusually close to the British government, holding regular meetings with ministers in which they push policy recommendations that serve Oracle’s interests.\n\nThere is a reason why men whose fortunes are built on AI investments would target the UK, and that is the National Health Service (NHS) and its unique population-level health data. Tech experts talk about Britain’s health records in almost hushed tones. While Europe and the US have some comparable health data sets – such as US veterans’ medical records – none have the depth and breadth of NHS records dating back to 1948. Its potential commercial value, from drugs to genome sequencing has been estimated at up to £10bn per annum.\n\nWhen Labour came to power last July it did so promising economic growth and an end to the UK’s productivity crisis. Just five days after Keir Starmer was elected, Blair told the TBI’s ‘Future of Britain’ conference that AI was the “game-changer” they were looking for. Within months, Starmer was parroting Blair’s language – and the TBI was in the box seat of the government’s nascent AI policy pushing Oracle’s interests and its founder’s world view.\n\nThe FOI documents highlight two TBI staff who took direct, influential roles in government and reveal the institute’s influence over Peter Kyle, a former advisor in Blair’s second term, who was appointed technology secretary despite little experience in the sector, and came into office calling for governments to show “a sense of humility” to Big Tech companies.\n\nAt the same time the TBI’s policy director Charlotte Refsum was invited into the UK health department to meet digital policy chief Felix Greaves. She was later given an official role in a government working group advising on data and technology policy in Labour’s 10 year plan for the NHS.\n\nThroughout this period, the TBI has championed initiatives designed to unify public data, including a national data library (NDL). The NDL was little more than an idea when Labour put it in their election manifesto. And there are still competing visions for what it should be. AI boosters foresee data from across government used for training and inference by Large Language Models; while many tech experts want to minimise privacy risks inherent in pooling data from so many sources and ensure that any benefits accrue to the UK.\n\nEllison told Blair of his interest in NHS data when he was interviewed by him at the Dubai World Governments Summit in February 2025: “The NHS in the UK has an incredible amount of population data,” Ellison enthused, but it was “fragmented”.\n\nTwo weeks later, Blair’s institute published a report entitled Governing in the Age of AI: Building Britain’s National Data Library. In it, the not-for-profit institute echoed Ellison on the UK’s data infrastructure, calling it “fragmented and unfit for purpose”.\n\n“There is a real hard sell going on here that says: ‘these kinds of gains are inevitable.’ But they are not,” said Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London. “TBI is not advocating for building that capacity within the NHS. They are saying: let’s outsource to our buddies.”\n\nMultiple staff working for TBI during the Ellison cash injection speak of a sea change in culture. McKinsey consultants took senior positions and clashed with staff from humanitarian and development backgrounds. Ex-employees say this led to the institute pivoting away from writing reports and recommendations by well-meaning development experts towards pushing aggressive tech solutions across the board.\n\nOracle and TBI’s connections are not just rhetorical. By 2023, joint retreats had become commonplace. At the institute’s headquarters at One Bartholomew Place in London, the teams would convene in the basement with executives from Oracle, Blair’s key advisor Macon-Cooney and Awo Ablo — who came to sit on the board of both TBI and Oracle sometimes present. Senior TBI employees have been hosted at Oracle’s headquarters in Austin, Texas, coordinated by a TBI employee whose role is to “scale and manage” the partnership with Oracle. Former staff recall that there were other earlier “hush hush” joint retreats at Ellison properties in the US.\n\n“It’s hard to get across just how deeply connected the two [organisations] are,” a former TBI staffer said. “The meetings were like they’re part of the same organisation.”\n\nAs the TBI’s partnership with Oracle deepened, employees told us they started to see Oracle staff started to slide into TBI employees’ calendars and schedule meetings in order to find out what the institute was doing in different countries and “scope out opportunities”, recalls one former TBI staffer. Soon employees from the two entities were having regular joint calls.\n\nThis sat uncomfortably with many TBI staff, with some describing having to push Oracle’s technology despite knowing they were not in the best interests of the country in question, and even had the potential to cause harm.\n\nThe risk of so-called vendor-lock in – tying a buyer to a single supplier – was a source of unease, with one former staffer saying that advising governments to use Oracle cloud services risked “trapping” and “indebting” them in systems that are “initially free but will start charging in future”.\n\nRwanda, a country where TBI has been present for more than 15 years, was so frustrated with Oracle that it issued a public tender in 2021 for a database management system, stating that it had been “experiencing a very high cost for support and licensing for Oracle systems and it would like to migrate to an affordable system”.\n\nMarvin Akuagwuagwu worked as a data analyst for TBI’s Africa Advisory unit in 2022 and 2023, focusing on Covid vaccine delivery. He said when he raised legitimate concerns, such as a lack of power supply and cyber security threats, when introducing new technologies to African countries these were dismissed by more senior colleagues.\n\n“I’m an African, I have lived experience, and I’m saying these things, but I wasn’t being listened to. You have to downplay those negative things,” he said.\n\nThis investigation was part of the series “The invisible Hand of Big Tech” led by Agência Pública and by Centro Latinoamericano de Investigación Periodística (CLIP), with the participation of 16 other organizations from 13 countries: ICL (Brasil), Núcleo (Brasil), La Bot (Chile), Primícias (Ecuador), Factum (El Salvador), Televisa N+ (Mexico), Cuestión Pública (Colombia), El Diario AR (Argentina), El Surti (Paraguay), IJF (Canada), Tech Policy Press (US), Tempo (Indonesia), Crikey (Australia), Daily Maverick (South Africa), Reporters Without Borders (International), El Veinte.",

    "description": "Small businesses struggled to observe the national shutdown to protest ICE. Here's why a boycott of companies like OpenAI and Amazon could be easier and more effective.",
    "fullText": "Economic boycotts are a familiar tool of protest. The problem is they often place the greatest strain on the smallest businesses.\n\nThat was the case during Friday's nationwide general strike, which was designed to pressure the Trump administration to dial back its aggressive anti-immigration policies.\n\nFor many small business owners, the shutdown created a dilemma. Supporting the cause often means losing a day's revenue and risking their ability to keep staff employed. Across social media, owners voiced solidarity alongside an apology for staying open.\n\nThere may, however, be another way, according to Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University famous for his critiques of Big Tech.\n\nInstead of a blanket shutdown, Galloway is calling for Americans to focus on major tech companies by unsubscribing from — or opting out of — services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office.\n\nA targeted boycott starting on Sunday and lasting the entire month of February could move markets, he says, which would, in turn, affect the CEOs who have the ear of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We're proposing something quieter and less cinematic than a protest that will run all day on cable TV, but much more disturbing to the Trump administration. A one-day slowdown is irritating. A one-month slump is terrifying,\" he wrote in a blog post announcing the boycott.\n\nMajor tech CEOs have sought favor with the president during his second term. Many of them donated to his inauguration, for starters.\n\nAI executives, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also accepted an invitation to a White House dinner with Trump in September, where the leaders took turns lauding the president. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attended the White House premiere of the documentary about first lady Melania Trump at the height of January's anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.\n\nSupporting the AI industry in its competition with China is a major pillar of Trump's economic agenda.\n\n\"These are the leaders who have his ear,\" Galloway writes. \"A modest reduction in their companies' growth could have a substantial impact on valuations priced to perfection. Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House.\"\n\nRegular protests against the tactics of ICE and Border Patrol personnel have gripped the country for months. Thousands marched through Minneapolis again on Saturday. Tensions rose dramatically in January after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, both at the hands of federal immigration agents.\n\nIn both instances, protesters recorded videos and posted them to social media for the world to see, leaving little room for the Trump administration to spin the events in its favor.\n\nWhile those videos and the subsequent protests — as well as the attempted nationwide shutdown — have spread awareness, they have so far done little to substantively shift the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security demoted a key Border Patrol official last week and promised more changes. At the same time, however, the acting director of ICE expanded the power agents have to carry out warrantless searches, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.\n\n\"Real change always comes from the American people, not from our political parties. But power doesn't fear protests nearly as much as economic withdrawals,\" Galloway writes. \"Getting off your couch, taking to the streets, and building community is important, but the most radical act in a capitalist society isn't marching, it's not spending.\"",

    "title": "I moved back to Australia after decades in the US. The culture shock stunned me",
    "description": "After living in the US for decades, returning to Australia brought unexpected culture shock and forced me to rebuild a sense of home.",
    "fullText": "When I was in my early 30s, I went for a three-week holiday to my home in Sydney and never left.\n\nFor years, I had toyed with the idea of moving back home, a place I had not lived since I was 7 years old. I'd even made a couple of attempts at it, but the comfortable pull of family and more than 25 years of life in the US always lured me back.\n\nWhen extending my trip week by week turned into deciding to stay, I assumed slotting back into life in Australia would be the easiest move of my life. After all, I was used to adjusting to a new environment. My father's job in the film industry meant I spent my childhood moving frequently (13 different schools in multiple cities and countries).\n\nSurely moving back home would feel as comforting as slipping on a well-worn, much-loved cardigan. I was wrong.\n\nI never thought I would experience culture shock moving back to Australia, but that was exactly what happened. All my years overseas meant I had missed large parts of general knowledge, I didn't understand cultural references or sayings, and I found Australian politics completely befuddling.\n\nAlthough I still sounded Australian, a quick conversation, which inexplicably always started with \"where did you go to high school?\" quickly established I was not from here. After being viewed as a foreigner my whole life in the US, I was now viewed as a foreigner in Australia, too.\n\nWhat's more, I realized with surprise that I was culturally very American. All the things I had taken for granted in the US (convenience, customer service, and affordability) just didn't exist in Australia.\n\nThere were the daily frustrations of not being able to get a coffee past 3 p.m. (or before 7 a.m.), no salad bars or real Mexican food, and the expense of absolutely everything (Sydney is Australia's most expensive city).\n\nCultural norms were an even bigger adjustment. Handshakes for acquaintances and bear hugs for friends (standard etiquette in the US) were replaced with one or two kisses to the side of (not on) the cheek.\n\nMaking friends with Sydney-siders felt hard, so I initially gravitated toward foreigners who were generally open and friendly. When I'd meet Americans, I felt an innate level of comfort and familiarity unlike anything else.\n\nIn my first year back home, I thought a lot about the phrase \"you can never go home again.\" I'd always been pretty dismissive of it, believing I could return to Australia at any time and it would feel like home. Finally, I came to understand the truth in the phrase. We just can't return to a previous place or point in life and recapture our original experience.\n\nJust like I adjusted to the culture shock of moving to the US as a little girl (hello, mayo on sandwiches, ice in water, and excessive air conditioning), I needed to acclimatize to Australia. I had been making the move so much harder than it needed to be because I expected it to be easy and familiar.\n\nAs I started to let go of the expectation that I'd fit right in, I started to feel more at home, back home. I built up experiences and connections that grounded me, and as I got older, my American background became less noticeable and less relevant. It's taken a long time, but I now feel entirely at home here. In the end, the key was to start from scratch and get to know my hometown as an adult, rediscovering my Australian identity along the way.",

    "fullText": "You wouldn't wait until your 50s to start saving for retirement — so why wait until your heart is already at risk to start protecting it?\n\nHeart disease is spiking among younger people, in part because people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are procrastinating on their health, according to Dr. Sadiya Khan.\n\nKhan, a professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at Northwestern University, told Business Insider that changes to your diet and exercise habits now can pay big dividends as you age.\n\n\"You can't just become older and then hope to make all these changes,\" she said.\n\nThe earlier you understand your heart health, the better equipped you are to make healthy decisions for future you.\n\nRight now, most of us are behind in our investments to our cardiovascular health. The average American's heart is 4 to 7 years older than their calendar age, according to Khan's research.\n\n\"All of us are naturally driven to procrastinate,\" she said. \"You try to worry about the things that are immediately in front of you, and it's harder to prioritize and give as much attention to something that is a long-term consequence.\n\nAn online tool, developed by Khan and her team, helps forecast a person's risk of heart attack or stroke over the next 30 years by illustrating how they stack up to their peers. It shows their percentile rank for heart health: in other words, out of 100 people the same age and sex, how many have a higher or lower risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nKhan said the new tool uniquely uses percentiles to help people manage their health by understanding their risk and making changes if needed. Patients can then prioritize which habits provide the best bang for their buck in terms of health benefits, starting with what Khan recommends most.\n\nKhan said a big challenge with heart health is that it can be highly individualized. All the factors involved — diet, exercise habits, genetics, and stress — can vary widely from person to person.\n\n\"It's not going to be a one-size-fits-all,\" she said. \"It's this overarching goal that we need to personalize how we communicate risk and how we can share that information in a way that works for each patient.\"\n\nThat makes it hard to recommend a specific game plan to boost everyone's heart health. However, there are a few strategies that can pay off for most people.\n\nFor best results, try to make small, sustainable changes that you can keep up over time.\n\n\"It depends on what works for you and what you are able to stick with,\" Khan said. \"They all matter, but you don't also need to do it all at once.\"",

    "fullText": "Hamburger chains dominated the fast-food sector in the 1980s and '90s after the \"burger wars\" launched among McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.\n\nThe burger wars transitioned into an original chicken sandwich war, also in the 1980s, among the same three rivals. It was revived in the new millennium with Popeyes' launch of its chicken sandwich in August 2019.\n\nRival Chick-fil-A countered Popeyes' new sandwich with a statement on Twitter that its sandwich was the original, introduced in 1964, and fast-food chains everywhere began introducing or reintroducing chicken sandwiches.\n\nWith all of these chicken sandwiches launching, fried chicken restaurants became the most popular concept in fast food.\n\nFried chicken dining chains are likely to remain the most popular subsector of the fast-food industry in 2026, if the concept continues the trend it set over the last year.\n\nTraffic to chicken concepts rose 3% in the year ending September 2025, while all concepts dropped 1% compared to the previous year, according to market research firm Circana, as reported by Fast Company.\n\nThe variety of chicken options offered, such as chicken pieces, chicken fingers, or chicken sandwiches, and how consumers enjoy their choices, may contribute to the continued popularity of the concept, an expert says.\n\n“This is due to the experiences the brands are creating as well as the variety of chicken and how you can enjoy it,” industry expert Reilly Newman of Motif Brands told The Food Institute. “This comes to no surprise, as the experience economy has been taking root across the globe.\n\n“Chicken allows for (ample) customization, sauces, and forms, depending on the buyer’s preferences,” Newman said.\n\nNot every fast-food chicken restaurant benefited from increased traffic in 2025, as some operators suffered financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy filings.\n\nA bankrupt operator of more than 130 Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen franchise restaurants has closed 17 underperforming locations in Florida and Georgia and filed a motion to reject all of the stores' leases.\n\nThe franchisee, Sailormen Inc., which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15, filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami to reject the leases after closing eight locations on Jan. 19, five locations on Jan. 20, and four locations on Jan. 22, according to court papers.\n\nThe debtor asserts that the leases should be rejected as of the petition date, since the restaurants were closed within one week of the petition date and before the hearing on the debtor's first-day motions.",

    "fullText": "Comedian and pundit Bill Maher was taken aback when a lone audience member cheered the arrest of independent journalist Don Lemon, exclaiming “It’s not good!”\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, the interview guest was  Nate Bargatze, comedian, actor, and host of the new game show “The Greatest Average American” and star of the upcoming film “The Breadwinner.”\n\nThe panel guests were Joe Scarborough, co-host of MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” and author of the daily newsletter “The Tea, Spilled by Morning Joe”; and former Republican congresswoman from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nDuring the panel segment, Maher was running through a list of “fascist” things the Trump administration has done recently when he cited Lemon’s bombshell arrest:\n\nBILL MAHER: A viral video in Maine, ICE guy’s taking this woman’s, a picture of her license plate, and she says, why are you taking my information down? This is caught on tape, I guess, because they have the quote, “because we have a nice little database, and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.”.\n\nThat is exactly what they do in fascist governments. Whenever you’re a protester, you’re actually an enemy of the state, and we arrest you. That’s what’s going on in Iran right now.\n\nSomebody went, “Yes,” like good, I don’t know. I don’t know. (AUDIENCE GROANS) It’s not good to arrest him! I don’t, you know.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Well, I’m going to say he violated the FACE Act. He went into a church, disrupted their worship, and then later in an interview compared them to white supremacists. That’s not journalism. That’s activism. I had an experience with Don Lemon.\n\nBILL MAHER: What, does it warrant getting arrested?\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Disrupting a worship service, stopping people’s right to worship God, that is violation of the FACES Act. And under the Biden administration, pro-lifers were sent to prison up to 11 years for praying in front of an abortion clinic and they were convicted under the FACE Act.\n\nSo I don’t think that’s journalism, that’s not First Amendment going in and harassing people in the middle of church. And you know, Don Lemon came to my office with the Tesla takedown guy that organized it and we had to call Capitol Police.\n\nBILL MAHER: Okay, but can we just charge him with not cool, man?\n\nWatch above via HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nThe post Bill Maher Stunned By Audience Member Cheering Don Lemon Arrest: ‘It’s Not Good! first appeared on Mediaite.",

Friends pulled him from the ‍water with severe injuries to both legs.\n\nOn Sunday, a community \"paddle-out\" at Bondi Beach honoured Nico, with aerial Australian Broadcasting ​Corp. footage showing paddle boarders and surfers forming ‌a large circle in the ocean.\n\nLocal surf lifesavers, as well as school friends and relatives, took part, local media reported.\n\nDozens of beaches, including in Sydney, were closed in January after four shark attacks in ⁠two days, as heavy rains ​left water murky and more ​likely to attract sharks.\n\nIn September, a surfer was killed by a large shark at ‍Sydney's Long Reef ⁠Beach.\n\nAustralia averages 20 shark attacks a year, fewer than three of them fatal, according to ⁠data from conservation groups. Those numbers are dwarfed by drownings ‌on the country's beaches.",

    "fullText": "CNN correspondent Veronica Miracle began coughing and choking live on camera when Trump ICE agents fired pepper balls into a crowd of protesters at an ICE facility in Los Angeles.\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of CNN’s OutFront, anchor Erin Burnett tossed to Miracle as she reported from LA amid protests across the country against Trump’s deportation forces.\n\nWhen ICE fired on the crowd, Miracle exclaimed “I just got hit!” and choked on the chemical irritant for a considerable stretch — then kept reporting:\n\nBURNETT: I want to go straight to Veronica Miracle because she is there on the ground in L.A., where the crowd that I know that is around you, Veronica, is on ICE property. What are you seeing?\n\nVERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, it’s really intense here. And, Erin, I just — we just all got pepper sprayed. And so I’m just still recovering from that. There’s so much of the pepper spray still in the air and so, so many people around us coughing and gagging, including us.\n\nSo, it’s been a really interesting scene here. I’ve never seen this before in all of my years covering protests here in this area, here in downtown L.A., where they were actually, these protesters were able to get onto the property. There was a skirmish line of police officers of Department of Homeland Security officers. They were in a bit of a line, and the protesters overtook them and were able to basically push them further and further back all the way to the loading dock, where they essentially cornered all of them and pushed them back inside.\n\nThere was, you know, a bit of a skirmish. There were some pepper spray, people were throwing bottles, but ultimately these protesters have overtaken this property, which I have never seen before. Usually, police are here and they’re able to keep protesters off of the property.\n\nThis is a crowd that is kind of at the tail end of a very long protest. This started at 1:00 p.m. local over in city hall. Okay, I just got hit! Hold on, hold on. I just got — sorry.\n\nBURNETT: All right, take your time there, Veronica.\n\nMIRACLE: Sorry. I can’t breathe. I’m sorry.\n\nBURNETT: Take your time. Take your time. Right. Let’s just make sure Veronica’s okay.\n\nMIRACLE: Yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah.\n\nUNIDNETIFIED MALE; Let’s go back.\n\nMIRACLE: All right. So obviously, they’re — they’re shooting. They’re shooting something. Pepper balls or something. So, it looks like you can see an officer back there. He’s alone, and they’re just throwing things at him.\n\nI mean, it’s just pretty incredible that these protesters have overtaken this. And there’s really. There’s no police.\n\nI don’t see anybody here to kind of manage this crowd. So like I was saying, this is at the tail end of a very long day. It looks like they’re — they’re cheering because they were able to push that officer back inside.

    "description": "Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S. threatens a stranglehold on the communist-run nation.\n\nTogether, those discussions paint a picture of a ​people pushed to the limit as goods and services - particularly those tied to ever more limited fuel supplies - become scarcer and more expensive.\n\nFor much of rural Cuba, this is not entirely new. The island's frail and antiquated power generation system ‌has been slowly failing for years and residents have grown accustomed to spending hours at a time without functioning electricity, internet or water pumps.\n\nBut the seaside capital, where the streets are lined with 1950s-era cars and colorful if decrepit Spanish colonial architecture, has until recently fared better.\n\nNow crisis looks set to swamp it, too, as fuel shortages ‌take hold, with first Venezuela, then Mexico halting oil shipments to the island.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs will be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe in the wake of the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.\n\nIn many other countries, the conditions would have sent people out into the streets. So far, in a nation where dissent has long been curbed, there has been little sign of protest. But it is unclear how much more Cubans will be willing to endure.\n\nCuba's peso has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar in three weeks, pushing up the price of groceries.\n\n\"This has put me in an impossible situation,\" said Yaite Verdecia, a Havana resident and housewife. \"There's no salary that can cope with this.\"\n\nDAILY LIFE GETTING ⁠MORE DIFFICULT\n\nTrump, when asked about the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in Cuba shortly after ‌the capture of Maduro, said he did not think an attack was necessary because \"it looks like it's going down.\"\n\nOn Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an \"international emergency\" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat.\"\n\nBut the government has said little about how it will manage the growing threat of humanitarian crisis.\n\nMany of the Cubans Reuters spoke with said daily life - already difficult - had ‍been reduced to basics like assuring food, fuel for cooking, and water, and that it had become noticeably harder in recent days.\n\nLines for gasoline have grown significantly this week at a handful of service centers in the city still supplied with fuel. And since the U.S. blocked Venezuelan deliveries of oil to Cuba in mid-December, virtually all gas has been sold at a premium, in dollars - a currency to which few Cubans have access.\n\n\"It used to be that you could sign up and get fuel once a month (in pesos),\" said Havana resident Jesus Sosa, referring to an app that would let residents know ​when it was their turn to fill up their cars. \"Not anymore. Sales in national currency have stopped.\"\n\n'YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE OR STAY HOME'\n\nThe crunch has hit both public and private transportation, putting some buses and private taxis out of business and forcing ‌others to raise their prices.\n\nDaylan Perez, a 22-year-old who hails private taxis for clients in old Havana, said fewer buses mean people now have no choice but to pay rising fees for private transport.\n\n\"You have to pay the price or stay home,\" he said.\n\nEven transportation by electric vehicle - once thought to be a panacea in a city short of fuel - has been hit by blackouts that now last for eight to 12 hours or more.\n\nTaxi driver Alexander Leyet of Havana swapped to an electric three-wheeled taxi recently, thinking he had outsmarted the pack.\n\n\"Now because of the blackouts I can only charge my taxi for four or five hours,\" he said.\n\nFor decades, the government that has its roots in Fidel Castro's 1959 Cuban Revolution has survived despite sometimes brutal economic struggles, upending regular predictions of imminent collapse or an uprising.\n\nIt has long alleged a U.S.-led effort to foment revolt, but the most recent widespread protests were in the pandemic year of 2021, despite a 12% contraction of the economy between 2019 and 2024.\n\nSharp crackdowns on any form of dissent, combined with the emigration of between one and ⁠two million people since the pandemic, have all but eliminated organized in-country opposition. The Cubans interviewed by Reuters generally declined to answer questions about the prospect ​of protests.\n\nBut none of those interviewed disputed that change was necessary.\n\n\"I'm just praying God finds a way to get us out of this (mess),\" said Mirta ​Trujillo, a 71-year-old street vendor from Guanabacoa who burst into tears as she told Reuters she could no longer afford food. Previously, she had depended on a ration book of basic goods provided by the government, but that was phased out post-pandemic as tourist income and other sources of hard currency dried up.\n\n\"I'm not against my country... but I don't want to die of hunger,\" she said.\n\nOn a recent weekday evening, Reuters witnessed an ‍accident at a busy intersection in Havana where the stoplights were not ⁠functioning as a result of a power outage.\n\n\"Sometimes when the power goes out, accidents happen because the traffic lights don't work,\" said Raysa Lemu, whose apartment overlooks a boulevard in Marianao, on the outskirts of Havana.\n\n\"It used to be they turned off the power two or three times a week, but now it's every day and sometimes it's up to 12 hours.\"\n\nJulia Anita Cobas, a 69-year-old housekeeper from Guanabacoa, gets up at 4 a.m. each morning for a 10-mile (16-km) commute that now approaches four ⁠hours round-trip. With less public transportation available, the journey has become longer and more costly.\n\n\"I leave my house before sunrise and I don't know how I'll get back,\" she said.\n\nBut Cobas, who was born just before Castro's revolution, said she had no expectation that Trump would make things any better.\n\n\"Since I was born the (United States) ‌has been threatening us, and every day we deal with hardship. But we've survived it all,\" she said.\n\nAimee Milanes, a 32-year-old resident of Reparto Electrico, just outside Havana, said neither the Cuban nor the U.S. government offered her ‌much hope.\n\n\"We're drowning. But there's nothing we can do,\" said Milanes. \"This is about survival. Nothing else.\"",

I'll just concentrate on the snooker.\n\n\"It would be wonderful to take the Brandon Parker Trophy home. It would mean so much and possibly more to me than any other player on the tour.\"\n\nMurphy opened his semi-final with a 122 break and, after being pegged back in the next frame, hit two further centuries - 129 and 125 - on his way to a comfortable victory.\n\n\"For a lot of that match I was close to my best,\" he added.\n\nMurphy's dominant form carried over from earlier rounds, which saw him dispatch Kyren Wilson and Mark Allen with ease.\n\nIt will be a second German Masters final for Murphy, who lost to Mark Selby in 2015.\n\nIn Saturday's evening session at the Tempodrom Berlin, three-time German Masters winner Trump reached the final after beating Ali Carter 6-2.\n\nTrump took the first four frames before Carter fought back to make it 4-2.\n\nHowever, Trump was able to see out the match and move a step nearer a first trophy since the 2024 UK Championship.",

    "fullText": "Crypto prices remained under pressure on Friday as the U.S. government entered a partial shutdown after lawmakers missed a midnight funding deadline, adding another layer of uncertainty to a market already struggling to find buyers.\n\nBitcoin traded around $83,559, up about 1% on the day but down roughly 6.8% over the past week, according to the price screen.\n\nEther sat near $2,686, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours and 9% on the week. XRP changed hands near $1.72, down about 1.6% on the day and close to 10% lower over seven days.\n\nThe shutdown itself looks short. The Senate passed a funding package, but the House is out until Monday, so the government will still hit a technical lapse over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Saturday that it would operate with \"very limited staff\" from Jan. 31 onward due to the shutdown.\n\nThat timing matters for risk assets because it lands right into thin weekend liquidity and a heavy headline cycle, which may pressure bitcoin and the broader crypto market over the weekend.\n\nThere is also a clean crypto angle here that is not just “risk off.” Prediction markets have spent the past 24 hours showing how messy the definition of “shutdown” can get.\n\nTraders on Polymarket and Kalshi were forced to think like lawyers. The government can be “shut” on paper at 12:01 a.m. and still look normal to most people for two days. That gap between legal status and real-world impact is exactly where contract wording and settlement rules start to bite.\n\nFor crypto, the shutdown headline is more of a sentiment stress test than a direct economic shock. It keeps traders cautious, pushes people toward smaller position sizes, and makes dips feel heavier because buyers do not want to step in front of a weekend news tape.",

    "title": "Giant Virus Discovered in Japanese Pond May Hint at Multicellular Life's Origins",
    "description": "Did viruses create us?",
    "fullText": "Scientists in Japan have discovered a previously unknown giant virus, offering new insight into this enigmatic category of viruses – and possibly also into the origins of multicellular life.\n\nThe virus was found infecting an amoeba in a freshwater pond near Tokyo, the researchers report. They named it \"ushikuvirus\" after the pond, Ushiku-numa, located in Ibaraki Prefecture.\n\nGiant viruses were largely overlooked during the first century of modern virology, with initial discoveries often misidentified as bacteria due to their size. Yet while we barely knew they existed until recent decades, we've since learned giant viruses are all around us.\n\nViruses in general are considered the most abundant biological entities on Earth, and some of the most perplexing. Little is known about the evolutionary history of viruses, and there is still ambiguity about whether they qualify as living organisms.\n\nEven if they are not living, viruses clearly wield enormous influence over all forms of life, including us. That includes not just hijacking a host's cells and causing illness, but also occasionally meddling in its evolution.\n\nViruses can facilitate horizontal gene transfer among living things, and some – known as retroviruses – insert their DNA into the genome of host cells. If that happens in a host's germline, viral DNA can be passed on to its offspring.\n\nIn fact, ancient retrovirus remnants now comprise up to 8 percent of the human genome, which has its perks. Retroviral DNA might have given early vertebrates the ability to make myelin, and it was key for the evolution of the placenta.\n\nMuch earlier, viruses may have sparked an even bigger, more mysterious innovation: the evolutionary leap from prokaryotes, or single-celled organisms, to eukaryotes, or multicellular organisms.\n\nEukaryotic cells typically have a membrane-bound nucleus, representing a \"chasm in design\" from their nucleus-free prokaryotic forebears. It's unclear how such a dramatic change occurred, but one intriguing theory suggests that nuclei were a gift from viruses.\n\nKnown as viral eukaryogenesis, this idea was first proposed in 2001 by Masaharu Takemura, a molecular biologist at the Tokyo University of Science. He suggested the nucleus of eukaryotic cells arose from a large DNA virus, like a poxvirus, that infected some prehistoric prokaryote.\n\nInstead of causing trouble, the virus made itself at home in the cell's cytoplasm, eventually acquiring important genes from its host and gradually transitioning into a cellular nucleus.\n\nThis theory gained traction with the 2003 discovery of giant viruses containing DNA, which form structures called \"virus factories\" inside host cells. These factories are sometimes enclosed in a membrane and tend to look and function a lot like the nuclei of eukaryotic cells.\n\nScientists have since found a variety of these giant viruses, including species in the family Mamonoviridae and the closely related clandestinovirus, which infect certain types of amoebae. Giant viruses are highly diverse and difficult to isolate, though, so a new find like ushikuvirus is a big deal.\n\nTakemura is still investigating viral eukaryogenesis a quarter century after he introduced the idea, and was part of the team that identified and described ushikuvirus in the new study.\n\n\"Giant viruses can be said to be a treasure trove whose world has yet to be fully understood,\" Takemura says. \"One of the future possibilities of this research is to provide humanity with a new view that connects the world of living organisms with the world of viruses.\"\n\nUshikuvirus infects amoebae known as vermamoeba (Vermamoeba vermiformis), a habit it shares with clandestinovirus; while its shape and spiky capsid surface resemble those of medusaviruses.\n\nIt also stands out from other giant viruses, however. It forces its host cells to grow abnormally large, for example, and its capsid spikes have unique caps and fibrous structures.\n\nRather than preserving a host cell's nucleus and replicating inside, as clandestinovirus and medusaviruses do, ushikuvirus instead forms a viral factory and destroys the host's nuclear membrane.\n\nThese similarities and differences can be vital clues, helping scientists piece together the evolutionary history of giant viruses. Takemura and his colleagues hope to learn how and why these viruses diversified so much, as well as what role they played in the rise of eukaryotes like us.\n\n\"The discovery of a new Mamonoviridae-related virus, 'ushikuvirus,' which has a different host, is expected to increase knowledge and stimulate discussion regarding the evolution and phylogeny of the Mamonoviridae family,\" Takemura says.\n\n\"As a result, it is believed that we will be able to get closer to the mysteries of the evolution of eukaryotic organisms and the mysteries of giant viruses,\" he says.\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Virology.\n\nMysterious Structure in Bird Eyes May Explain a Curious Lack of Blood\n\nFierce Storms Expose 19th-Century Maritime Mystery on Jersey Shore\n\nGreat White Sharks Grow Deadly New Types of Teeth as They Age",

He also gives us work-rate, so we keep him on the pitch.\"",

    "fullText": "Everton manager David Moyes has criticised the laws of the game after he was booked for sprinting onto the pitch to celebrate Beto's last-gasp equaliser against Brighton.\n\nBeto came off the bench to score a 97th-minute equaliser on his 27th birthday, earning the Toffees a 1-1 draw at the Amex Stadium.\n\nUnable to contain his emotions after snatching the point, the 63-year-old Scot set off from his dugout and ran onto the pitch, before referee Chris Kavanagh issued him with a yellow card for leaving the technical area.\n\nMoyes drew comparisons with David Pleat's celebrations at Maine Road after his Luton side avoided relegation from the top flight on the final day of the 1982-83 season with a win against Manchester City.\n\n\"I hope you're not going to call me 'Pleaty' going forward,\" Moyes said after the game.\n\n\"The difference is Pleat doesn't get booked for it, they think it's OK and everybody enjoys seeing the celebrations.\n\n\"We're killing it. The managers can't come out of their technical area to celebrate a goal, knee sliding, do things which give you people [the media] quite a bit to talk about.\"\n\nAsked if he would do it again, Moyes replied: \"I bloody will do it again!\n\n\"Actually, if I'd been a bit more mobile, I might have done a knee slide. That would only have got me a yellow as well, so I might as well have gone the whole hog.\"\n\nEarlier this season, former Chelsea head coach Enzo Maresca was handed a one-match touchline ban after being shown a second yellow card for leaving the technical area to celebrate with his players in their last-gasp win against Liverpool.\n\nCrystal Palace manager Oliver Glasner joked that he was fearful of getting suspended for last season's FA Cup final after cutting short his celebration in the 3-0 semi-final win over Aston Villa.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United head coach Michael Carrick has praised the backing he has received from the club's fans and says he is \"not offended\" by the protest planned before Sunday's Premier League encounter with Fulham.\n\nCarrick has a 100% record in his second spell in charge following unexpected wins against Manchester City and Arsenal.\n\nDespite the improvement following Ruben Amorim's dismissal and the fact United moved into the Premier League top four for the first time this season following the Arsenal success, the 1958 fans' group is pushing ahead with its protest.\n\nThe group claims it expects between 5,000 and 6,000 fans to attend the protest march, although given it will start an hour before kick-off from either side of the stadium and meet in the middle by the 'Law, Best, Charlton' statue outside Old Trafford, exact numbers will be difficult to quantify.\n\nOrganisers say they have \"a few surprises in store\".\n\n\"Our protest has never been about performances on the pitch, not now, and not once in the last 21 years,\" they argue.\n\n\"We are judging a dysfunctional ownership model that has repeatedly failed.\"\n\nIn his autobiography, Carrick said the Glazer family were \"great owners\".\n\nFew fans agree with those sentiments, regardless of whether they intend to join the protest or not.\n\nAnti-Glazer songs are a feature of every game United play, while recently minority owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe has been the focus of negative supporter sentiment.\n\nAsked for his thoughts on the issue, Carrick preferred to focus on the support both he and his team have received rather than address the wider issue.\n\n\"I don't think it [the protest] connects with the two wins, to be honest,\" he said.\n\n\"I fully respect the supporters. I'm not offended by it or anything, and the players certainly aren't.\n\n\"Within the stadium, the support we've felt, and that's been there for all the games that I've watched for quite some time, has been of the highest level and I'm sure it will continue to be like that.\n\n\"The connection we've had over the last couple of weeks has been pretty special and we've both fed off that. That's exactly how we wanted it to be and is something we need to keep building on moving forward.\"",

    "fullText": "A new study confirms that electrifying vehicles significantly reduces air pollution. Researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC found that for every 200 zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) added, nitrogen dioxide levels fell by 1.1% in California neighborhoods.\n\nThe research, published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, used high-resolution satellite technology to measure air pollution from 2019 to 2023. The research team summarized their findings in a press release and touted the significant public health ramifications.\n\n\"This immediate impact on air pollution is really important because it also has an immediate impact on health,\" senior author Erika Garcia said. \"We know that traffic-related air pollution can harm respiratory and cardiovascular health over both the short and long term.\"\n\nTo that end, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure is linked to both cardiovascular risks, such as heart disease, and respiratory ailments, such as bronchitis and asthma attacks. While the same research team made suggestive links between ZEV adoption and reduced NO2 in an earlier study using ground-level monitors, this study went a step beyond with more definitive data sources.\n\nThis study divided California into 1,692 neighborhoods using DMV ZEV registration data and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for daily NO2 measurements. A typical neighborhood gained 272 ZEVs during the study.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of results, the study included several additional analyses. The research confirmed NO2 declines weren't solely due to pandemic-related changes. On the flip side, they also found that neighborhoods that added gas-powered vehicles saw an increase in NO2 pollution.\n\nThe study also suggests greater potential to further clean the air. ZEV registrations rose from 2% to 5% of light-duty vehicles in California during the study period, indicating that there's much room for improvement.\n\nNext, the study's authors will examine whether more ZEVs are associated with fewer asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits.\n\nTheir work adds to the extensive research on whether EVs are better for the planet long-term than their gas-powered counterparts. Despite imperfections such as mining, the findings are clear on that front. The USC team is showing that when it comes to the air we breathe and public health, the benefits of EVs are undeniable.\n\n\"These findings show that cleaner air isn't just a theory—it's already happening in communities across California,\" declared Sandrah Eckel, the study's lead author.\n\nWould you be more willing to drive an EV with 500 miles of range?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill Saturday that expands the state Supreme Court from five justices to seven as frustration has mounted among Republican lawmakers over a string of defeats before the tribunal.\n\nRepublican advocates for the change argued that it would help improve the court's efficiency. But legal experts said it could have the opposite effect and set a dangerous precedent at a time of tension between the branches of government. The state's judiciary did not ask for more justices on the high court.\n\nDemocrats, who were united in opposition to the bill, called timing suspicious. Last week the Legislature asked the court to overturn a redistricting ruling that gave Democrats a strong shot at picking up one of Utah’s four Republican-held congressional seats in the fall.\n\nNew justices could be in place when the court decides the fate of the congressional map.\n\nBecause the bill received approval from more than two-thirds of legislators, it took effect immediately after the governor signed it, allowing him to bypass a several-month waiting period to start adding justices.\n\nIn Utah, justices are appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate. Justices in many other states are elected.\n\nMost states have five or seven Supreme Court justices, but a few have nine. Cox, a Republican, has said the additions would put Utah in line with other states of its size. He has denied that the policy is politically motivated, noting that Republican governors and senators have made all recent appointments.\n\nOnce he fills the new seats, Cox will have appointed five of the seven sitting justices.\n\nLast month Republican lawmakers took authority from state Supreme Court justices to select their own chief justice and gave that power to the governor.\n\n“Seven sets of eyes reviewing the most complex and difficult issues our state has ever faced is better than having only five sets of eyes,” said House Majority Leader Casey Snider, a Republican sponsor of the bill.\n\nJohn Pearce, who recently retired as associate chief justice, said this month that he doubted the change would make the court more efficient.\n\n“The more sets of comments you have to take into account, the longer the process takes,” Pearce said. “If what the Legislature is hoping to do is speed up the work of the court, it's going to be counterproductive.”\n\nTwo states — Arizona and Georgia — have added justices in the past decade after making similar arguments about efficiency.\n\nIn the first few years after Arizona grew its court in 2016, several past and present justices said it made things less efficient because more people had to review opinions before they could be published.\n\nArizona's court now issues slightly more rulings per year, while Georgia's issues slightly fewer than before.\n\nUtah Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told legislators on the opening day of the 2026 session that the court had “essentially no backlog” and urged them to add judges to lower courts, where the need is greater. Bill sponsors responded by adding some lower court judges and clerks.\n\nThe Utah State Bar has raised concern over the expansion and other proposals that it said would weaken the judiciary's independence. Among them is a bill that would create a new trial court with exclusive jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges. The proposal would limit the ability of other judges and courts to block potentially unconstitutional state laws with injunctions.\n\nRepublicans have also been collecting signatures to try to place on the November ballot an initiative that would restore their ability to draw voting districts that deliberately favor a political party, a practice known as gerrymandering.\n\nLee reported from Santa Fe, New Mexico.",

    "fullText": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a judicial misconduct complaint by U.S. Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald ​Trump's administration over its move to deport several Venezuelans to El Salvador.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam ‌Bondi took the rare step in July of announcing the complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., alleging ‌he made improper comments about Trump during a meeting of the judiciary's policymaking body, the Judicial Conference.\n\nChief U.S. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in a newly-released order dated December 19 said the alleged statements, even if true, would not violate judicial ethics rules.\n\nThe Justice Department did not ⁠respond on Saturday to requests for ‌comment. Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, declined to comment.\n\nBondi announced the complaint days after Boasberg said he might initiate disciplinary proceedings against ‍Justice Department lawyers for their conduct in a lawsuit brought by Venezuelans challenging their removal to a Salvadoran prison.\n\nBoasberg in April concluded the administration appeared to have acted \"in bad faith\" when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights ​on March 15, at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess ‌the effort's legality.\n\nThe DOJ's complaint focused on comments attributed to Boasberg by the conservative media outlet The Federalist during a meeting of U.S. Judicial Conference in March that was attended by Chief U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe Justice Department alleged Boasberg expressed his concern to Roberts and others that the administration would disregard court rulings and trigger \"a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nThe DOJ argued those comments ran afoul of the ⁠judicial code of conduct, and that Boasberg wrongly acted ​on his belief in the litigation over the Venezuelans, who ​were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nDue to potential conflicts among judges in D.C., Roberts transferred the complaint to the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit's Judicial Council.\n\nSutton ‍said the DOJ lacked ⁠proof Boasberg made such statements, which even if uttered would not be improper during the judicial policymaking body's closed-door meeting.\n\n\"In these settings, a judge’s expression of anxiety about executive-branch compliance with ⁠judicial orders, whether rightly feared or not, is not so far afield from customary topics at these meetings—judicial independence, judicial ‌security, and inter-branch relations—as to violate the Codes of Judicial Conduct,\" Sutton wrote.",

Inland, wind gusts of 30–40 miles per hour are possible.\n\nFlooding in combination with frigid temperatures could pose the additional threat of tidal floodwaters freezing on roadways.\n\nIn Philadelphia, much of southeastern Pennsylvania, and western New Jersey, snowfall is expected to be lighter, with little accumulation expected.\n\nThese areas sit near a sharp snowfall gradient, meaning impacts could change quickly if the storm’s path adjusts.\n\nEven if snow largely misses Philadelphia, strong winds and very cold air will affect the entire region this weekend. Gusty winds could make temperatures feel much colder and create slick spots where light snow or earlier precipitation occurs.\n\nWind chills are expected to drop into the single digits and teens, increasing the risk of icy conditions on untreated roads and sidewalks.\n\nStay connected with FOX LOCAL.

    "description": "After Chelsea's first comeback win from two goals down in a Premier League match, were Liam Rosenior's substitutions against West Ham genius or obvious?",
    "fullText": "It has been some start to life as a Premier League manager for Liam Rosenior.\n\nSaturday's thrilling comeback win against West Ham was Chelsea's third league win in a row since the 41-year-old replaced Enzo Maresca at the start of January.\n\nAnd, in one of his biggest tests to date, it was his drastic half-time substitutions that led to the Blues recovering from 2-0 down to win 3-2 and moved them into the top four.\n\nAfter making seven changes from their midweek Champions League win in Napoli, a limp first-half display allowed relegation-threatened West Ham to deservedly take control.\n\nBut, making three half-time changes, Rosenior inspired a comeback in which substitutes Marc Cucurella and Joao Pedro hauled Chelsea level with a goal apiece - before Enzo Fernandez's dramatic stoppage-time winner.\n\nCriticism can be levelled at Chelsea for a poor first half in which they were booed off, fully deserved to be two goals down, and raised further questions about the quality of their squad.\n\nAfter the match, Rosenior played down the importance of his substitutions, instead crediting the mentality of the players since his arrival.\n\n\"My biggest learning is there's a spirit and a fight and a resilience in this group that I really, really like,\" he said. \"I've demanded that from the first day of stepping in.\n\n\"We haven't had many training sessions, but we've spoken about reacting positively to setbacks.\n\n\"We've spoken about reactions to losing the ball, pressing, energy, intensity. All of that was there in the second half, which wasn't there in the first half. I don't put that just down to the changes I made.\"\n\nOverall, Rosenior's early reign, now four weeks old, has been characterised by grinding out results and impactful in‑game adjustments.\n\nHis predecessor Maresca ended his tenure after a breakdown in relations with the ownership and having dropped a league‑high 15 points from winning positions - prompting frequent criticism of his mid-match decisions.\n\nFormer Chelsea winger Pat Nevin told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Liam Rosenior went back to not exactly Chelsea's best team, but what Chelsea knew and the system they feel comfortable in. It now feels like tactical genius because they have won.\"",

    "fullText": "The sight of Noni Madueke flying past defenders and putting dangerous crosses into the penalty area will have been a welcome sight for Mikel Arteta.\n\nAnd Madueke's performance in Arsenal's 4-0 hammering of Leeds will have been even more well received, given that he was drafted into the starting line-up minutes before kick-off after Bukayo Saka picked up a hip injury in the warm-up.\n\nThe 23-year-old created Martin Zubimendi's opener, before seeing his corner punched into the Leeds net by goalkeeper Karl Darlow for the Gunners' second, as Arteta's men moved seven points clear at the Premier League summit.\n\nMadueke was signed by Arsenal from Chelsea this summer - with some fans questioning the move - in a bid to strengthen their squad depth and provide cover should key man Saka pick up injuries.\n\nAnd the England winger showed in his 60 minutes on the pitch just why the club made that decision.\n\nArteta said: \"He was ready. Because you cannot do that in two minutes. The way he prepares, the way he's waiting for opportunity, I think paid off today because he really impacted the team.\"\n\nWhile Arsenal are waiting for a diagnosis on the extent of Saka's injury, Madueke will be hopeful he has earned another start for Tuesday's EFL Cup semi-final second leg against former club Chelsea.\n\nSaka and Madueke are also competing for a place for England as the summer's World Cup approaches. So will the latter now get the chance to start staking his own claim?\n\n\"Noni Madueke was really good, especially when you come so late into the game,\" former England midfielder Fara Williams told the BBC's Final Score.\n\n\"It is an opportunity for him and he has performed well. When he went in at Arsenal and Saka got injured, he had an opportunity to get some games, then he got injured himself.\n\n\"When he has been playing for England, he has shown what he can do. He will be a headache for both managers, Mikel Arteta and Thomas Tuchel, in the summer.\"\n\nEx-Manchester United striker Dion Dublin added on Final Score: \"Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke are both internationals, and both doing an incredible job.\n\n\"Saka will likely start [for Arsenal and England] because he is the better of the two, and he is more consistent. But it is a great headache to have.\"",
