    "fullText": "Celtics' Payton Pritchard leads NBA in impressive stat originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nPayton Pritchard is among the most underrated No. 3 scoring options in the league.\n\nThe 6-foot-1 Boston Celtics guard has done nothing but improve his game since entering the league in 2020, and with Jayson Tatum sidelined with an Achilles injury, he’s received a more significant offensive role with the 2024 NBA champions.\n\nAccording to the X/Twitter account 'Real App, ' Payton currently leads the NBA in an impressive stat.\n\n“Payton Pritchard has the most games in the NBA this season with 25+ points & zero free throws attempted,” the notable statistics-based account stated.\n\nWhy is that stat so admirable? Well, it’s common for players to erupt for 25+ points while attempting multiple free throws. In some cases, it’s so extreme that fans will throw out terms like ‘foul baiter’ and ‘free throw merchant’ to help diminish a player’s performance.\n\nWhen an individual doesn’t get any whistles in a 25-point outing, it means they had no choice but to fight through contact and score at a high clip. Pritchard has done just that this season, helping the Celtics navigate life without Tatum.\n\nPritchard is averaging 17.0 points, 5.3 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game this year, shooting 45.9% from the field and 35.3% from downtown. The Celtics will need Pritchard to remain consistent if they want to return to the NBA Finals.\n\nMore NBA: Warriors predicted to cut ties with Jonathan Kuminga, acquire $108 million two-time blocks leader",

    "description": "The NFL has informed its clubs about the salary cap outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "While the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks are preparing for their showdown in Super Bowl LX, the other 30 teams in the NFL are already in offseason mode. On Friday, the NFL shared some crucial information with all of them: the salary cap projection for the upcoming season is out.\n\nAccording to a report by NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, the league will set its spending ceiling for 2026 in the range of $301.2 million to $305.7 million per team. For comparison, the cap was set at $279.2 million for the current season.\n\nAt between 7.9% and 9.5%, the increase from 2025 to 2026 marks the latest major jump in the cap. In the five years since taking a one-year dip due to the fallout from the Covid-19 pandemic, it has grown by more than $100 million.\n\nDespite having been among the most active team in the NFL last offseason, the Patriots are again in decent shape heading into 2026.\n\nAccording to salary cap expert Miguel Benzan, who is using the middle ground of $303.45 million for his calculations, the AFC champions are currently projected to be $42.6 million under the cap with 50 players signed. This places them in the top-10 for the next league year.\n\nNew England may be less financially flexible as last spring, when the club was near the top of the table, but it still has ample resources available to maintain the quality of its roster and add outside talent. At the moment, after all, only seven of its current players are headed for unrestricted free agency, with defensive linemen Khyiris Tonga and K’Lavon Chaisson as well as safety Jaylinn Hawkins the most prominent names on the list.",

Elliott did his best to break the hold or escape but Micallef just tightened his grip to secure the submission.\n\nA split second later, Elliott fell unconscious with the fight ending at 3:31 in the second round.\n\nJUST LIKE THAT 💥\n\nJonathan Micallef gets the submission victory in round two! #UFC325\n\n[ LIVE on @ParamountPlus ] pic.twitter.com/m9QX7dEu2I\n\n“Incredible, there’s nothing like it,” Micallef said after his win. “He surprised me on the hands. When I felt him, I’m just too big, too strong, too technical on the ground. I’d like to get active this year. Neil Magny, nothing but respect … but I’d love to punch you in the head.”\n\nPrior to the finish, Micallef started strong with a good counter punch that clipped Elliott and put him down on the canvas briefly. But Elliott survived and forged a comeback with some solid striking combinations including a shot that opened a cut over Micaellef’s eye.\n\nElliott continued pressing forward and it looked like the momentum was shifting in his favor until he ended up on the ground with Micaellef on his back. While Elliott defended the submission immediately, Micallef slyly secured the choke with his hand behind the head, which made it almost impossible to break his grip.\n\nWhile he didn’t tap out, Elliott went to sleep with the fight ending in the second round.\n\nNow 2-0 in the UFC, Micaellef seems like a prospect worth watching and he’ll look to build on this latest win when he returns later in 2026.",

    "fullText": "Steve Tisch Epstein files, explained: What we know about Giants co-owner's emails with sex offender originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNew York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch is shown to have been connected to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, according to newly released emails, per The Athletic.\n\nTisch is said to have received “scouting reports” on women from Epstein. The reports assessed whether they were “pro or civilian” or a “working girl.”\n\nThe emails are reported to have been sent in 2013 and were made public as part of the latest batch of more than 3 million Epstein-related documents released by the Department of Justice on Friday, Jan. 30.\n\nHere is what we know about Tisch’s connection to Epstein.\n\nTisch is an American film producer and businessman. He was born on February 14, 1949, and is 76 years old. Tisch's biggest movie was 1983's \"Risky Business,\" which he helped produce and in which Tom Cruise starred. He was also a producer on \"Forrest Gump,\" \"American History X,\" and \"Snatch,\" all of which received critical acclaim.\n\nTisch is the son of former Giants co-owner Preston Robert Tisch. He now serves as the chairman, co-owner and executive vice president of the Giants. Tisch is the only person in history to have earned a Golden Globe, Academy Award, a Primetime Emmy nomination and a Super Bowl ring.\n\nTisch's name appears more than 440 times in the 3 million released documents, per ESPN. The emails concerning Tisch range from the \"mundane\" to more profane. Most of them refer to Tisch setting up \"dates\" with women through Epstein. There is not enough information available to determine whether any legal issues exist at this time.\n\nHours after the publication of The Athletic's story on the emails, the New York Giants provided a statement from Tisch acknowledging the existence of some emails about adult women. Tisch denied that anything further happened, however.\n\n\"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy, and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with.”\n\nThe NFL has not yet issued a statement on the situation.\n\nThe first email released so far was from May 2013. According to The Athletic's report, Epstein emailed Tisch, who said he was still in an NFL meeting. Once Tisch was free, Epstein suggested a Russian woman could meet, and Tisch immediately replied, asking if she was “fun.”\n\nThe next email is from June 2013. Tisch reached out asking about a specific woman, Epstein responded, \"(Tahitian) speaks mostly french exotic.\" Tisch asked if she was a working girl, and Epstein responded, \"Never.\"\n\nLater in June, Tisch emailed Epstein, \"Is my present in NYC?\" Epstein replied \"Yes\" to which Tisch asked the next morning, \"Can I get my surprise to take me to lunch tomorrow?”\n\nEpstein reached out to Tisch in another exchange, \"Did you contact the great a-- fake tit (name redacted) she’s a character, short term, has an older boyfriend going to acting school, a 10 a--.” Tisch responded, \"Thanks Jeffrey. Curious to know about (name redacted). I will contact (name redacted) … pro or civilian?” Epstein responded, \"civilian, but Russian, and rarely tells the full truth, but fun.”\n\nEpstein later followed up with Tisch after he'd connected with one of the women and let him know, \"report just in, you did very well, she wants to go to the play, she is a little freaked by the age difference but go slow … i will try to convince her not to return to Ukraine. having her crying worked.” Tisch replied, \"Nice report … Funny comment on crying!!!”\n\nPer The Athletic, other emails are between Epstein and women about Tisch. One referenced that the producer would be able to get her in movies saying, \"Gonna meet Steve Tisch next week for a dinner, He said that he gonna work on 3 movies starting June. So I’ll ask if I can read scripts and maybe audition for some part.”.\n\nIn September 2013, according to The Athletic, Tisch offered Epstein two tickets to Giants games, and to other games. Epstein is shown having offered Tisch to visit the private island in the Caribbean, but it is not clear whether Tisch took him up on the offer ever.\n\nAnother email touched on the subject the duo's relationship. Epstein and Tisch were discussing a date Tisch had been on and Epstein wrote, \"I am happy to have you as a new but … shared interest friend.”\n\nTim Mara helped found the Giants in 1925. He then passed the team to Jack Mara and Wellington Mara, who became co-owners in 1939. Tim J. Mara became a co-owner in 1965 and held a stake in the team until 1990. The following year, Bob Tisch took his place as co-owner.\n\nWellington Mara and Bob Tisch were co-owners through 2004. In 2005, the current co-owners, John Mara and Steve Tisch, took over. The pair has served as co-owners of the franchise for the past 20 years.",

    "fullText": "Real Madrid are hoping to keep up their strong recent form in La Liga when they host Rayo Vallecano on Sunday. Barcelona’s victory over Elche on Saturday means Los Blancos trail by four points in the La Liga title, but a win of their own would see this cut back down to one.\n\nAs per Diario AS, head coach Alvaro Arbeloa looked ahead to the match against Rayo, which he expects to be tough.\n\n“It’s very important and fundamental, for our aspirations in La Liga, to be able to win tomorrow. Rayo is always a very uncomfortable, pressing, aggressive team. Everyone knows their identity and the difficulty it is going to put on us. We are very focused on going out to give our maximum level to win the three points.”\n\nArbeloa was asked about whether he considers Thibaut Courtois, Fede Valverde, Jude Bellingham, Kylian Mbappe and Vinicius Junior to be “untouchable”, with them having played every minute of Real Madrid’s last four matches (vs Levante, AS Monaco, Villarreal and Benfica).\n\n“I understand football debates, but I always want to have the best on the pitch. And the more minutes they can be for me, at the team’s disposal, the better. We saw it, for example, in Villarreal. With 2 minutes to go, in stoppage time, Mbappe’s goal comes from a very good action by Vinicius, who goes inside, turns the game around, finds Mbappe and is awarded a penalty.\n\n“They are players capable of unbalancing a game at any minute. And well, because there will be people who are not Real Madrid fans who do not want them to be on the field. I imagine that what Real Madrid fans want is for their best players to always be available, always on the pitch. The five you said… they are players who can be in the top ten, worldwide. So they have my full confidence. And it’s not that it’s my confidence, but it’s their performance that puts them on the pitch.”\n\nIn the lead-up to Sunday’s match, there are murmurs of more fan discontent being displayed at the Bernabeu, as has been the cases in recent weeks. However, Arbeloa expects the Real Madrid support to be behind the team against Rayo.\n\n“I expect a Bernabeu that is with the team, as it was in the last home game. And how they know we need. I will always ask for their support at the Bernabeu, because with them we are much stronger. They know that our objective, obviously, is to win on Sunday; to continue in the fight for La Liga, one for which we are fighting… very strongly, with a lot of desire. And if we want to stay there, we need them. They are very aware. The Monaco match showed what we are capable of when we are united; the confidence they give to the players. And that with them, together with us, everything is much easier.”",

    "description": "Brooks Koepka is understandably frustrated with his putting while losing more than six strokes to the feild on the greens in the Farmers Insurance Open",
    "fullText": "SAN DIEGO — In a round that he'd put plenty of circles and squares on his scorecard, Brooks Koepka had a strong chance to head for the locker room feeling decent about his Saturday in the 2026 Farmers Insurance Open. After starting on the 10th hole of Torrey Pines' South course, he was only 55 feet from the cup after two shots at his closing hole, the par-5 ninth. He was pitching for eagle.\n\nThat Koepka walked away with a bogey 6 said a lot about how much he struggled with his putter. He had only 39 inches left to make birdie but ended up three-putting from there to finish with a one-over-par 73 that put him in a tie for 61st place, 19 shots behind leader Justin Rose.\n\nThere was another flat stick disaster and a double bogey at the par-3 11th, with Koepka three-putting by missing an initial four-foot putt that rolled 10 feet past the hole. He then misfired on that.\n\nFor those who made it to the weekend at Torrey Pines, Koepka ranks second-to-last for the tournament in strokes gained/putting, losing 6.19 to the field. On Saturday alone, he lost nearly 5½ shots on the greens.\n\nThe five-time major winner was asked after the round if he had hope for fixing his putting issues at next week’s WM Phoenix Open. “It can’t get worse, right?” he said.\n\n“Game feels good. I think putting is probably last in the field, but never really putted well here. Don't know the answer to it right now. I'll probably try to figure that out when I'm done with you guys. But I'm very happy with everything. Seems to be lining up, so I'm very pleased.”\n\nAmong the possible reasons that Koepka’s West Coast Swing appearances were infrequent before he left for LIV Golf 3½ years ago is that he is a Floridian who grew up on Bermuda grass that is far different than the spongy Poa annua in the West that tracks up easier while growing tiny buds as the day goes on.\n\n“I've never felt comfortable on Poa,” Koepka said. “You just miss a few and you've got zero confidence. … Today, I felt every three-, four-footer was slightly downhill, and I felt like it kind of went a little bit of both ways. I tried to firm 'em all and take the break out to still be aggressive like I normally am. But I wasn't even hitting the hole.”\n\nKoepka refused to blame the conditions of the putting surfaces.\n\n“These greens are actually really, really good,” he said. “It has nothing to do with the greens; it's all me.”",

Soldier Field, the lakefront and the environment,\" runner Abe Martinez said. \"You can't beat the runners from Chicago. We're a different breed.\"\n\nMartinez celebrated his 61st birthday while taking on the frigid temperatures.\n\n\"As long as you're covered, and wear the proper gear you're fine,\" Martinez said. \"If you put too much on, you layer up, you sweat a lot.\"\n\nOther runners like Jon Kinsey mentally prepared to take on the challenge for the very first time.\n\n\"This past week has really helped, you know. You just get out there everyday, you're doing it,\" Kinsey said. \"Just have fun. We've got plenty of salt on the road here so you're not going to slip and hurt yourself. Just keep a temp going so your heart is beating you know.\"\n\nLoving teams cheered on these bold athletes. Glencoe's Gail Klewin and Northbrook's Kathy Hofschield were bundled up supporting Klewin's son.\n\n\"He just runs everyday, all year, so he's ready,\" Klewin said.\n\n\"I think it's amazing,\" Hofschield said. \"I'm just in awe of their resilience and determination.\"",

    "description": "The Minnesota Vikings went big in free agency last year to bolster the interior defensive line, but fast-forward a year, […]",
    "fullText": "The Minnesota Vikings went big in free agency last year to bolster the interior defensive line, but fast-forward a year, and it’s still an area the team needs to address.\n\nThe Vikings desperately needed to add some pass rush to their IDL for the 2025 season. They did so by signing a couple of aging veterans on the back of injury hits and down seasons, in the form of Javon Hargrave and Jonathan Allen. Both players had their moments but also struggled, and ultimately signing both to big contracts doesn’t look like a great decision. Minnesota probably has to move on from at least one of them to make savings against the salary cap.\n\nFormer Vikings general manager Kwesi Adofo-Mensah also made the surprising move to trade away starting nose tackle Harrison Phillips before the 2025 season began. His absence left the Vikings’ run defense floundering at times last season.\n\nThe good news was that Jalen Redmond truly emerged as one of the Vikings’ best defensive players, showing ability in run defense and pass rushing. He should now be the pillar to build the rest of the team’s defensive line around.\n\nThe Vikings have some decent depth players at IDL, including Levi Drake Rodriguez, Tyrion Ingram-Dawkins, and Taki Taimani. Unless one of those shows incredible progression, they may stay as depth pieces, while the Vikings will have to look at replacing Hargrave and Allen — both at 30+, they were never long-term solutions.\n\nThe best way to find a long-term solution is through the draft, and I certainly wouldn’t rule out Minnesota using an early draft pick to address this area of the team. If Clemson’s Peter Woods slid down the board, he would be a great option.\n\nOther interior defenders that are receiving first-round buzz include Caleb Banks and Kayden McDonald — the latter was sent to Minnesota in Pro Football Focus’ latest mock draft. Alternatively, new general manager Rob Brzezinski could use one of his three Day 2 draft picks to address the position.\n\nThe Vikings could also look to bring in another, preferably younger, veteran into the mix. Once again, looking to free agency, although there’s not a great deal of quality at a young age available. Levi Onwuzirike is perhaps the standout candidate. Or they could look to trade for Daron Payne, a player who could be available.\n\nWhatever happens over the next few months, I would expect there to be some turnaround on the Vikings’ defensive line. Preferably, it will involve getting younger and more talented.",

    "description": "Newcastle United needed no reminding of Hugo Ekitike's quality after trying to sign him last summer - and the Liverpool striker haunted his former suitors at Anfield on Saturday.",
    "fullText": "Anfield was silenced as Anthony Gordon looked to the Kop and defiantly pointed to his ear.\n\nThe Newcastle United forward had just fired his side in front against Liverpool with a well-taken 36th-minute finish.\n\nBut were Liverpool about to finally lose a top-flight fixture against the visitors on their own turf for the first time since 1994?\n\nWas the champions' winless run in the Premier League about to extend to six games?\n\nNot if Hugo Ekitike had anything to do with it.\n\nThe France forward dragged his side level with a poacher's finish - then fired them in front with a quick-fire second before half-time, much to the delight of manager Arne Slot.\n\n\"The fans love him,\" Slot said after his side's 4-1 win. \"From the start, everyone could see how special he is, how fast he is.\"\n\nThese were the sort of finishes Newcastle's scouting team had seen plenty of, having tried to sign Ekitike, 23, on three separate occasions - including last summer.\n\nEven head coach Eddie Howe could not help but hold his hands up.\n\n\"Sometimes you have to acknowledge the player against you while also acknowledging we could have defended better,\" he said.\n\n\"Ekitike is an outstanding player and you saw that today. He's got a little bit of everything and that's his biggest strength. He's tall, quick and he can finish.\"\n\nEkitike scores twice as Liverpool beat Newcastle\n\nThere is no doubt that Ekitike can finish.\n\nHe has already scored 15 goals for Liverpool and such an immediate return will not come as a shock to Newcastle, who always thought the striker would thrive in the Premier League.\n\nEkitike was just 19 and a relative unknown in this country when Newcastle first tried to sign him from Reims in 2022.\n\nThe striker had \"a lot of respect\" for the Magpies, but did not feel the timing was right to leave mid-season.\n\nHowever, when Newcastle came calling again, a few months later, he opted to join Paris St-Germain before later moving on to Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nNewcastle hoped it would be a case of third time lucky last summer, but it was Liverpool who won the race - before also signing Alexander Isak from the Magpies - much to the anguish of club legend Shay Given.\n\n\"It hurts me from a Newcastle point of view,\" the former goalkeeper told Match of the Day. \"[Ekitike] could be wearing a black-and-white shirt.\n\n\"He is brilliant at stretching defences. He has picked Liverpool and of all the signings they did make in the summer, he has been the standout.\"\n\nThis was a night when Ekitike became the youngest player to reach double figures for Liverpool in a league season since Michael Owen in 2000-01.\n\nBut it was a performance which earned him comparisons with another lethal striker from the club's recent past - Fernando Torres.\n\nEkitike's second goal was a case in point. It was almost a carbon copy of Torres' first goal for Liverpool, against Chelsea in 2007.\n\nThe Frenchman latched on to Milos Kerkez's ball down the left channel, drove past Malick Thiaw and finished clinically.\n\nAnd the similarity certainly did not go unnoticed by the watching Steven Gerrard, who set up Torres against the Blues.\n\n\"It is all about Hugo Ekitike running the channel,\" he told TNT Sports. \"It is Torres-like.\n\n\"He gets it out of his feet and that toe-poke... He reminds me of Torres every time I watch him.\"\n\nGerrard forged a deadly partnership with Torres between 2007 and 2011 - and Florian Wirtz and Ekitike are starting to strike up a similar understanding.\n\nThe pair have become friends off the field and it is showing on it, with Wirtz and Ekitike having combined for six goals in all competitions - more than any other Premier League duo.\n\n\"Hugo was scoring a lot of goals from the start of the season and Florian was involved a lot in creating chances for his team-mates and was unlucky that balls did not go in,\" Slot added.\n\n\"It was not always possible to play them together every three days. That is what I mean when I speak about off the ball and match fitness - to be able to play every three days.\n\n\"That took a while for them to play at the best of their level at the highest intensity every three days. They are getting closer and closer, and it is no surprise the numbers are going up.\"\n\nLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "description": "An entrepreneur has ripped up the non-league rulebook since buying a football club.",
    "fullText": "Barrie Drewitt-Barlow is used to exploring the unknown.\n\nHe and his ex-husband Tony made headlines in 1999 when they became one of the first gay couples in the UK to have children through a surrogate mother.\n\nMore recently, the entrepreneur let a stranger live in his house for a reality show and has appeared on other shows such as Rich House, Poor House and Below Deck Sailing Yacht.\n\nWhat he never dreamed of doing was becoming the owner of a football club.\n\n\"I was the one who would sit on my laptop doing work when it ever came on the TV, or I'd go out,\" he says.\n\nBut now the 55-year-old cannot get enough of the beautiful game.\n\nIt has been a year since he completed a multi-million pound deal to purchase Essex-based Maldon and Tiptree Football Club.\n\n\"The offside rule still doesn't make any sense to me,\" he concedes.\n\n\"Every now and then when I see the whistle going from the ref or the linespeople, I just don't get it. I'm like, 'What's happened? Why has he stopped playing?'\n\n\"I almost thought they were doing a Morris dancing kind of thing with their flags at one point. It's not what I expected.\"\n\nDrewitt-Barlow grew up on a council estate in Manchester before moving to Essex and making a fortune in property.\n\nAcquiring Maldon and Tiptree FC in February 2025 marked his latest business venture.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow quickly oversaw the signing of some big names, including ex-West Ham United striker Freddie Sears and and the Zimbabwe international and former Colchester United, Leyton Orient and Southend United attacker Macauley Bonne.\n\nKevin Horlock, who once played for Manchester City, West Ham and Ipswich Town, was brought in as manager.\n\nThe arrivals made waves in the local football scene, as the Isthmian League North side, founded in 1946, are in the eighth tier of English football.\n\nIt was all the same to Drewitt-Barlow though.\n\nHe says: \"As a novice, you look at football and you see these crazy salaries from these big Premier League people - £300,000 a week – and it's not like that in this league.\n\n\"A lot of people still work regular jobs, this is a part-time thing for them.\n\n\"I didn't realise that kind of thing happened. I thought if you were a footballer, you're a footballer - you weren't a black cab driver or a roofer as well.\n\n\"But people have real lives and real jobs, that was the hardest thing for me to work out.\"\n\nAnother reality check for Drewitt-Barlow, who lives in Danbury, Essex, was the FA Cup.\n\nA series of impressive wins surged the Jammers into the first round proper of the prestigious English tournament.\n\nThere they faced Port Vale: a League One side who were 99 places above them in the footballing pyramid.\n\nWhat happened during the lead-up to the match quickly changed Drewitt-Barlow's entire outlook on the game.\n\n\"I'd heard about the FA Cup but I didn't understand the importance of it,\" he explains.\n\n\"I agreed with the FA to let the cup come here for an evening and I tell you now, the queues were round the block, down the street, for people to come in and see a piece of tin.\n\n\"It's like what the hell, people are actually that interested in this cup? Well, oh my God, they were.\n\n\"They were literally queuing, grown guys with their kids, waiting outside to come in and have a photograph taken with the FA Cup.\n\n\"Honestly, we felt the magic that night,\" he adds.\n\nIt was not just the excitement that Drewitt-Barlow, now club chief executive, was surprised by - it was the cash too.\n\nThe Jammers' match was chosen for TV coverage, earning them what he said was about £100,000.\n\nThe club also took half of the money earned on the gate, of which there were 4,551 fans in attendance, and won £15,800 in prize money for making it to the first round.\n\n\"I felt like all our Christmases came together with that FA Cup run,\" Drewitt-Barlow adds.\n\nEven before the match, which Maldon and Tiptree went on to lose 5-1, people were already talking about the businessman - who had been filmed during the cup draw.\n\n\"When it was announced on the TV I was like, 'Where the hell is Port Vale?',\" he recalls.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow has embraced becoming the pantomime villain on the terraces, but being targeted for his sexuality is where he draws the line.\n\n\"It's difficult on the terraces still,\" he says. \"That's where the bite comes from.\"\n\n\"There's still a massive stigma about being gay in football, but as time goes on those boundaries should break down.\n\n\"I don't mind being the whipping boy. They can call me all the names under the sun, I really couldn't give a flying hoot.\"\n\nDrewitt-Barlow claims to have been approached by footballers - three of which he says are currently playing in the Premier League - who are hiding being gay.\n\nHe is happy to help, but insists he does not want to become \"the poster boy for gay footballing\".\n\n\"I've already been classed as the poster boy for gay parenting or surrogacy and it doesn't get anybody anywhere,\" he adds.\n\n\"I don't think people want to [come out] because they're scared about what might happen in the dressing room, as well as on the pitch.\n\n\"I think the only people that can truly help and make it more normalised are the leagues and the FA.\"\n\nAway from the terraces, Drewitt-Barlow has been kept busy with renovations.\n\nFrom the clubhouse to the changing rooms, he has led an expensive overhaul of the facilities, which he described as \"semi-derelict\" when he arrived.\n\nEven purchasing grass for each goalmouth set him back £40,000.\n\nIt is very much a family operation, with husband Scott and son Aspen also overseeing the project.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow says: \"It was unloved, the place was tired. It needed somebody to come in, give it some love and show it some attention - and that's exactly what we did.\"\n\nUnder his stewardship, he claims Maldon and Tiptree have gone from attracting 70 spectators to an average crowd of 800.\n\n\"There's a lot of players who want to come here now, big players,\" he boasts.\n\n\"I can't walk around Tesco now without somebody telling me who we should be employing as a footballer.\"\n\nThe chief executive wants to take his club, which is in second place, into the English Football League and is chasing back-to-back promotions.\n\nHe reveals half the squad are being paid full-time, while the other half remain part-time.\n\nDrewitt-Barlow believes his club is now sustainable and will end the year in profit, boosted by the launch of a BTEC sports course in September.\n\nBut does he feel tired after his first year in football?\n\n\"Honestly, it's given me a fresh lease of life, I feel regenerated. I can't believe I didn't do this sooner,\" Drewitt-Barlow says.\n\n\"People love football, I never got it before now. I just did not get what people saw in football.\n\n\"Now I get it, I totally get it.\"\n\nFollow Essex news on BBC Sounds, Facebook, Instagram and X.\n\nZimbabwe's Bonne leaves Maldon & Tiptree\n\nJammers boss enjoying first FA Cup run\n\nProspective owners 'plan to rebuild club's ground'",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe San Francisco Giants have signed a three-time batting champion.\n\nThat may not have quite as much meaning in MLB eyes in 2026 as it would've in a bygone era, but it's still quite a cool thing.\n\nThis is, of course, about Luis Arraez.\n\nAccording to ESPN's Jorge Castillo, Arraez signed a one-year contract with the Giants on Saturday evening.\n\nMORE: How Jose Ramirez is on pace to become Cleveland's Derek Jeter\n\nArraez should have a good chance to play second base for the Giants, where it was previously set up as a position battle between Casey Schmitt and Tyler Fitzgerald.\n\nThe lefty with a short swing is a career .317 hitter at the MLB level and is going to turn 29 in April.\n\nArraez played the last season and a half for the San Diego Padres, so he moves over to another NL West team.\n\nHe was a batting champion for the first time in 2022 with the Minnesota Twins when he hit .316.\n\nHe was then at .354 for the Miami Marlins in 2023.\n\nIn 2024, he began the season with the Marlins but finished with the Padres and batted .314, his third batting championship, won with three different teams.\n\nArraez has walked more times in his MLB career than he has struck out (and he doesn't walk very much).\n\nMORE: Paul Skenes has added a new pitch\n\nThe downside with Arraez is that he doesn't have much power, but he actually has a .777 career OPS. That was .719 in 2025.\n\nHe won't set the world on fire, but he also puts the ball in play practically every time he steps into the box, and for those who enjoy a guy who hits the ball where it's pitched and has a short, level swing, Arraez will be fun to watch.\n\nIt's not a big investment for the Giants, so it's a worthwhile addition to have some steadiness in the lineup for San Francisco.",

While competing in her final downhill event before the upcoming world competition, Vonn crashed on the course and had to be airlifted to a nearby facility for treatment.\n\nThe skier lost control while attempting to land a jump during a World Cup downhill event, becoming tangled in the safety nets lining the course. When Vonn was able to get up, she was limping and favoring her left knee, using her poles to steady herself.\n\nHere are the latest injury updates for Vonn following her crash while preparing for the Winter Olympics.\n\nMORE: When do the Winter Olympics start\n\nVonn released a statement on her Instagram. She said, \"I am discussing the situation with my doctors and team and will continue to undergo further exams. This is a very difficult outcome one week before the Olympics...but if there's one thing I know how to do, it's a comeback. My Olympic dream is not over. I will give more information when I have it.

Her skiing coach, Chris Knight texted the Associated Presssaying that Vonn \"is preparing for Cortina as usual.\" Vonn herself posted on Instagram, announcing her withdrawal from the Super-G race and said that she is \"doing my best right now...\"\n\nThe U.S. Ski team also released a statement on Friday, backing up Vonn. \"Lindsey Vonn crashed in today's Cras Montana World Cup downhill and injured her left knee, however her Olympic dream isn't over yet.\"\n\nVonn had been running the fastest time at the first checkpoint before her injury. She landed a jump off-balance, then lifted her left arm and pole to try to regain her balance, and tried to brake.

    "fullText": "Jonathan Micallef pushed his Octagon record to 2-0 earlier tonight (Sat., Jan. 31, 2026) at UFC 325 LIVE on Paramount+ from inside Qudos Bank Arena in Sydney, Australia, stopping welterweight Oban Elliott with a comeback second-round submission (rear-naked choke).\n\nElliott, who came into Saturday as a betting underdog, was out for blood from the opening bell. Apparently there’s some sort of hatred for Micallef that carried over into the cage and fueled Elliott to jump out to a strong lead. Micallef just wasn’t able to get going on the feet and resembled little of what he looked like in his UFC debut nearly one year ago.\n\nThings kept going wrong for Micallef in the second round as Elliott’s hands starting landing more often. Elliott eventually hurt Micallef on the feet and could have gone for a knockout finish. Instead, he decided to stay in the clinch along the cage, which allowed Micallef the chance to reverse and score a nice takedown. From there, Micallef quickly locked up a tight rear-naked choke and eventually put Elliott to sleep.\n\nCheck out the video highlights below:\n\nJUST LIKE THAT 💥\n\nJonathan Micallef gets the submission victory in round two! #UFC325\n\n[ LIVE on @ParamountPlus ] pic.twitter.com/m9QX7dEu2I\n\nFor complete UFC 325 results, coverage, and highlights click HERE.",

    "fullText": "Michigan State football is reportedly among the list of schools with the most transfer portal departures in all of college football.\n\nThe last month has been a busy one for the Spartans when it comes to the transfer portal, with an abundance of players coming and going from the program. The number of players leaving reportedly ranked among the top of all of college football, according to On3.\n\nAmong all teams in college football, Michigan State was No. 7 in total player departures with 37 players leaving via the transfer portal. Michigan State was No. 2 among Big Ten teams, behind only Penn State who ranked No. 3 nationally, with 46 players departing via the portal.\n\nAs expected with any coaching change, we saw a large number of Spartans leave from this past year's team. This included both high-level players such as wide receiver Nick Marsh, running back Makhi Frazier and quarterback Aidan Chiles, and also a lot of backups and reserves. Ultimately, we will not know until the fall if Michigan State is better or worse off with the players that have left and been replaced by incoming transfer portal additions. But, this high number of players leaving the program through the portal is something that at least is noteworthy and interesting to see.\n\nClick on the post below to see the complete rankings of teams with the most players leaving through the transfer portal from On3:\n\nNEW: Schools with the most College Football Transfer Portal departures🔁https://t.co/lbDS9V8lFd pic.twitter.com/DZrnqLIDi1\n\nContact/Follow us @The SpartansWire on X (formerly Twitter) and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Michigan State news, notes and opinion.

    "fullText": "For the second straight year, the Detroit Lions will send six players to the 2026 Pro Bowl Games, which will be held at the Moscone Center in San Francisco, Calif., on Feb. 3. Coverage of the annual event will begin on ESPN at 6:30 p.m. ET, with the flag game at 8 p.m. ET.\n\nAs the NFL's top talents assemble in the Bay Area this weekend, let's meet the six Lions representatives:\n\nAfter a breakout campaign in his third NFL season out of Iowa, Campbell earned his first Pro Bowl selection and first All-Pro honor.\n\nThe former Hawkeye star led the Lions with 176 tackles (89 solo, 87 assisted), which is the second-most in the league behind Miami's Jordyn Brooks. Campbell also recorded 5 sacks, 4 passes defended, 3 forced fumbles, and 2 fumble recoveries.\n\nCampbell is also the first Lions linebacker to be selected to the Pro Bowl since Stephen Boyd's distinction in 2000.\n\nAppearing in his third Pro Bowl in his third season, Gibbs joins Barry Sanders and Billy Sims as the only running backs in team history to earn at least three Pro Bowl berths in the Super Bowl era.\n\nThis season, the former Crimson Tide icon ranked seventh league-wide in total yards, with 1,223 yards on 243 carries and 13 touchdowns, while catching 77 passes for 616 yards and five touchdowns.\n\nReplacing Seattle's Super Bowl-bound quarterback Sam Darnold, the 2025 Pro Bowl Games Offensive MVP will make his fifth Pro Bowl appearance.\n\nGoff completed 393-of-578 passes to finish second league-wide in yards (4,564) and touchdowns (34).\n\nDespite operating under a new offensive coordinator this season, he became the sixth quarterback in NFL history to produce 4,000 passing yards and 30 touchdowns in three consecutive campaigns.\n\nHutchinson earned the second Pro Bowl selection of his career after setting career highs in sacks, tackles, and forced fumbles, finishing with 14.5 sacks, 54 tackles, 14 tackles for loss, 4 forced fumbles, 3 passes defended, and 1 interception.\n\nHutchinson also led the league with 100 pressures, and his 91.9 overall grade from PFF ranked fourth among edge rushers. He became the first player in franchise history to log multiple 10.0-sack seasons through the first four years of his career.\n\nIn addition to the Pro Bowl nod, Hutchinson was named a finalist for the 2025 Associated Press Comeback Player of the Year and 2025 Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nAppearing in his fourth straight Pro Bowl in his five-year career, Penei Sewell will once again compete in the NFL's premier all-star event.\n\nHis 95.2 overall grade and 96.8 run-block grade from PFF led all offensive linemen this season, which stems from the former Oregon star allowing just one sack and six quarterback hits this year.\n\nSewell was named a finalist for the NFL's inaugural Protector of the Year Award in 2025 and joins Lou Creekmur and Lomas Brown as the only Lions tackles to earn at least four Pro Bowl berths in their career.\n\nSt. Brown, who has positioned himself amongst the NFL's elite wide receivers, earned his fourth straight Pro Bowl selection after recording 117 receptions for 1,401 yards and 11 touchdowns this season.\n\nThis past season, the USC product became the fourth player in NFL history to top 100 receptions and 10 touchdown receptions in three consecutive seasons.\n\nSt. Brown now joins Calvin Johnson and Herman Moore as the only wide receivers in team history to earn at least four Pro Bowl berths.\n\nFor more Lions coverage,  Follow Scout on X: @SpringgateNews\n\nThis article originally appeared on Lions Wire: Which Detroit Lions are participating in the 2026 Pro Bowl?",

    "title": "No. 16 Maryland women’s basketball collapses late against Oregon, 68-61",
    "description": "The Terps have now lost four straight contests.",
    "fullText": "No. 16 Maryland women’s basketball looked to be in the driver’s seat heading into the fourth quarter Saturday night at Xfinity Center.\n\nThe Terps led Oregon by six and had momentum after a big layup by Oluchi Okananwa, who had exploded for 27 points through three quarters. They looked on track to snap a three-game losing streak.\n\nBut for the second straight game, Maryland collapsed late. The Ducks shot 8-of-12 in the fourth quarter to rally for a 68-61 win over the Terps.\n\nWhat first appeared to be a rough stretch for the Terps has turned disastrous. Their four-game losing streak is tied for the longest in head coach Brenda Frese’s illustrious tenure.\n\nMaryland has now lost five of their last six games, and it ends a three-game homestand winless.\n\n“We’re all disappointed, frustrated to not close out three really close, tough games, especially at home,” Frese said. “We’re competing. We’re right there. Possessions are close. We just continue to see it’s a 40-minute game, and impactful possessions matter.”\n\nThe Terps scored just four points in the first eight minutes of the final frame, and that gave the Ducks a chance to go on a run.\n\nPerimeter shooting was the difference in the end. The Terps fell cold and shot 0-of-6. The Ducks found fire and made three consecutive 3-pointers to take a lead that they never gave up.\n\n“Oregon in the second half just came out with fresher legs, better depth made three [3-pointers] there in the fourth quarter that separated them,” Frese said. “No one’s going to feel sorry for us.”\n\nEarly in the season, Maryland’s defense looked to have drastically improved from previous years. But that trend has been bucked in Big Ten play, where the Terps have continually allowed elite individual performances.\n\nEhis Etute was the benefactor of that Saturday. The sophomore exploded for 26 points on 10-of-15 shooting — her first 20-point game in college — and outmatched the Terps’ bigs in the paint.\n\nEtute had her way with Isimenme Ozzy-Momodu offensively, forcing her into foul trouble. Etute only stands at an even six feet tall, but she still had a size advantage.\n\nMaryland needed a similar performance from its brightest star, Okananwa. She had struggled in the first two legs of the Terps’ homestand.\n\nEarly on, Okananwa found a burst — she notched Maryland’s first nine points. But Addi Mack was the only other Terp to score in the frame, and Okananwa went scoreless herself for the final 7:49 of the first quarter.\n\nThe lack of offense outside of the junior in the opening frame put the Terps into a hole — one that Okananwa then had to dig them out of. She was a lights-out 6-of-7 from the field in the second quarter.\n\nAfter scoring a combined 20 points in Maryland’s previous two games, she finished the first half with 23 — over 60% of the Terps’ first-half scoring.\n\nThe Terps trailed by as much as eight in the second quarter, but a 14-0 run gave them a six-point halftime lead.\n\nIn the second half Ducks adjusted their defensive approach on Okananwa; she wasn’t nearly as impactful.\n\nAt the same time, important contributors in Yarden Garzon and Saylor Poffenbarger were unproductive offensively. Garzon made one 3-pointer and finished with three points. Poffenbarger was impactful, just not offensively. She had two points and eight rebounds.\n\nThe Terps found most of their success down low as their struggles from beyond the arc continued; just two of their 15 3-point attempts on the night went in. Garzon in particular is Maryland’s best deep ball shooter, and she took just two attempts from beyond the arc — one of them was a desperation heave as time ran out.\n\nMaryland’s lineup has been depleted for the majority of Big Ten play, which does not help in games such as these. Saturday was yet another example of it failing to close out contests over the last month.\n\nAfter a strong start, Maryland’s season has reached a new low in Big Ten play, putting its status in the top-25 in jeopardy.\n\n1. Shot distribution. Mack and Okananwa combined for 38% of Maryland’s shot attempts on Saturday and 72.13% of its scoring. Maryland needed someone else to step up late in the game, but it seemed as though it had become too one-dimensional.\n\n“It’s just feeding the hot hand,” Okananwa said. “I was it for us early, and Addi was definitely it for us late. Just recognizing that as a team and wanting to get that person involved.”\n\n2. Mack had a strong supplementary game. Other than Okananwa, Maryland’s remaining offensive production was from Addi Mack. Mack scored 17 points on 5-of-17 shooting. Mack attacked the rim with relative success, facilitated well, was the primary ball-handler and dictated the offense’s pace.\n\n3. Breanna Williams added playing time. Frese tweaked her rotation from the team’s last few games. Breanna Williams hadn’t played against Iowa or Washington, but she played 16 minutes Saturday with Maryland desperately needing depth down low.\n\nBut Williams matched up with Etute for most of those 16 minutes. And Etute had a career night.\n\n“[Williams] gave us some really good spot minutes, within that. But, yeah, we tried to throw a lot of things at them defensively as well as offensively.",

    "fullText": "Barcelona and Real Madrid have done battle for a number of signings over the years, and the latest instalment is here. Both clubs are keen to strengthen their respective B teams, and they have set their sights on the same player: Sergio Martinez.\n\nBarcelona registered their interest in Martinez earlier in the month, and on that occasion, they were competing with Villarreal. They are now poised to face off against Real Madrid, who have also been working on strengthening their youth categories in recent months.\n\nAs per Diario AS, Barcelona and Real Madrid have both made offers to Racing de Santander for Martinez, who has lost prominence at the Segunda club in recent weeks. The idea of both is for a loan deal to be agreed with the inclusion of a buy option, although if necessary, they are prepared to secure a permanent deal outright.\n\nMartinez, who is only 18 years of age, is seen as a great promise, but with Barcelona and Real Madrid calling, it may be difficult for Racing to keep him. He’s a midfielder that can operate as a 6, 8 or 10, and this versatility is one of the reasons why the Clasico clubs are prepared to go head-to-head.\n\nThere are less than 48 hours remaining until the winter transfer window closes, so time is running out for Barcelona and Real Madrid to reach an agreement with Racing. Whoever does so first would have the advantage in this particular battle, although talks with the player could also be decisive.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether Martinez ends up come Monday night. The fact that Castilla play in the league over Barca Atletic could mean that Real Madrid have the advantage, although Barcelona’s record with promoting younger players into the first team could mean that they are more favourable.",

    "description": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. has been one of the main players floating in trade rumors, but it seems that Brooklyn isn't giving him away.",
    "fullText": "Brooklyn Nets forward Michael Porter Jr. is in the midst of what could be his first season as an All-Star given how well he has played for the Nets this year. Brooklyn won its first game of the season without Porter in the lineup on Friday with their 109-99 win at the Utah Jazz and it's possible that fact could be influencing how they view trading the sharpshooting forward.\n\n\"I know everybody thinks that Porter's available, that would be news to me. I have not heard that he is available. If he is available, I'll wait for Shams [Charania] to tell me because I haven't heard that,\" NBA insider Brian Windhorst said on ESPN's NBA Today show. Windhorst was commenting on the fact that Porter is considered one of the best available candidates to be traded, but the recent reporting suggests the alternative.\n\nPorter, 27, is having the best season of his career as he's averaging 25.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game while shooting 48.2% from the field and 39.8% from three-point land in 38 appearances. Porter's value to the Nets is immense this season as Brooklyn is just 1-8 in the games in which he's unavailable and 12-26 in the games he's able to play in.\n\nPorter has been connected to various teams that are looking for an upgrade in their pursuit of a playoff run including the Golden State Warriors as it seems that he has made it onto their radar, according to NBA insider Chris Mannix. Mannix noted that the Warriors remain interested in Porter, echoing reporting from other insiders earlier in the season, Golden State would only pursue the former Denver Nuggets star if Brooklyn is willing to bring their price down on him.\n\nBased on various reports, it seems that the Nets want multiple first-round picks in any Porter trade, a price that Golden State is unwilling to pay given that they're trying to secure their future after franchise legends Stephen Curry and Draymond Green retire. Be that as it may, it appears that Brooklyn is more likely to keep Porter than they are to trade him prior to the Feb. 5 deadline.\n\nWindy on MPJ:\n\n\"I know everybody thinks that Porter's available, that would be news to me.

    "description": "The Cleveland Cavaliers may be about to make some minor, but necessary moves at the NBA Trade Deadline.",
    "fullText": "The 3 trades the Cleveland Cavaliers are being tied to currently originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nStill, moves are expected to happen. Two of the biggest names that could be out the door by next Thursday include, but aren't limited to, Lonzo Ball and DeAndre Hunter. Right now, both men have seemingly worn out their welcome in Cleveland, and in order for the Cavs to get under the second apron comfortably, both men would likely have to be moved.\n\nLuckily for the Cavs, GM Mike Gansey has done a good job of building out some young players to make moves like this possible. The rise of Jaylon Tyson, the development of Craig Porter, and the unexpected boost that rookie Tyrese Proctor have given the Cavs this season have made Hunter and Ball expendable. Which is good, because neither man is going to fetch you that much back in a trade.\n\nIdeally, the Cavs trading Hunter and Ball away for nothing, or maybe a second-round pick in a future draft, would be ideal. That would get the Cavs under the second apron and allow them to make more moves in the future. Plus, the team has enough talent on its roster right now to try to contend without additional players coming back. These moves would also help the Cavs land LeBron James in the near future, assuming he wants to return to Cleveland to finish out his career.\n\nSo the trade rumors persist, and three of them have gotten the most traction, so let's look at them.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers acquire F DeAndre Hunter\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers acquire F Rui Hachimura and F Dalton Knecht\n\nAccording to Cleveland.com's Chris Fedor, this is a trade that's been talked about but doesn't seem to have much legs at the moment. The goal here is Knecht. Keeping Hachimura would be nice; he's a solid big man who can play a variety of positions, but his contract isn't appealing, and he doesn't offer much more than anyone on the Cavs roster currently. Sending Hachimura to a team like the Brooklyn Nets would be nice, as you as they can eat his salary, but that seems unlikely at the moment. Knecht makes it possible for the Cavs to move on from Max Strus in the offseason, saving the team even more money. That is, assuming Knecht can show some potential with the Cavs this season.\n\nThe Sacramento Kings acquire F DeAndre Hunter \nThe Cleveland Cavaliers acquire G Keon Ellis, G  Dennis Schroder, and Dario Saric.\n\nThe prior trade with the Lakers seems like a salary dump waiting to happen; this Kings trade seems like the opposite. While HoopsHype's Michael Scotto seems to believe that Ellis is the goal for the Cavs, they would be wise to consider keeping Schroder as well. The guard is everything the Cavs were hoping Lonzo Ball would be. He's a decent scorer still, and while not a stud by any means, he'd be a fine enough addition to the Cavs as a backup for Darius Garland. He's in the first year of a three-year deal that'll pay him between $14 and $15 million a year, so he may not be the guy you want to keep around past this season, but he could fill a need in the wake of the failure of Ball's trade if you don't trust Porter or Proctor yet.\n\nThe Washington Wizards get G Lonzo Ball\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers get TBD\n\nIt may not seem like much of a trade, but as reports have pointed out, Lonzo Ball is 460th in shooting percentage out of 450 eligible players. He's washed, and the thought of giving up Isaac Okoro for him in a trade makes some fans a little ill to this day. The Washington Wizards know that the Cavs wanna dump Ball's salary so that the Cavs have wiggle room for the trade deadline. So they're offering to take Ball off the Cavs ' hands, for a nominal fee. They want draft capital in return, according to HoopsHype Scotto. A fair offer, but it seems unlikely the Cavs would give up a first-round pick to get rid of Ball, so this could be a situation where Ball and two second-round picks head over to the Wizards for a second-round pick of their own. It's a bold move, but one that would get the Cavs closer to being under the second apron.",

The Tar Heels turned in an impressive performance after taking nearly a week off and coming off a much-needed road win over ranked Virginia. They turned the ball over only twice and scored 18 points off 14 forced turnovers.\n\nHere are the biggest takeaways from UNC’s win over Georgia Tech.\n\nCaleb Wilson delivered another standout performance in his second hometown visit, finishing with 22 points on 9-of-13 shooting from the field and 1-for-3 from 3-point range, along with four assists, four rebounds, a block and a steal. It marked his third straight game with at least 20 points and his sixth in the last eight\n\nJunior center Henri Veesaar and senior guard Seth Trimble also posted big games. Veesaar recorded another double-double, his 11th of the season, and remained tied with Wilson for the ACC lead in that category. He scored 20 points on 8-of-15 shooting with 12 rebounds and four blocks, while Trimble added 18 points on 8-of-14 shooting..\n\nLuka Bogavac scored 16 points off the bench, shooting six-for-10 from the field and 3-for-7 from beyond the arc. He continues his strong stretch from his last four outings. Forward Jarin Stevenson added seven points, six rebounds and two assists in 22 minutes off the bench.\n\nThe Tar Heels also shot an impressive 11-of-12 (91.6%) from the free-throw line, easily their best free-throw shooting game of the season. Veesaar and Wilson went to the line a combined six times, each making all three of his attempts.\n\nIn their last two games, the Tar Heels have made 26 of 34 free throws, a solid 76.4% from the line. They came in shooting 67.6%, one of the worst marks in the country.\n\nFollow us @TarHeelsWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of North Carolina Tar Heels news, notes and opinions.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Tar Heels Wire: UNC Basketball: Takeaways from victory over Georgia Tech",

He was shown on the broadcast as Darryn Peterson and AJ Dybantsa went at it. Peterson finished with 18 points and three rebounds in the Jayhawks' win. Dybantsa had 17 points. Both will likely go in the top three of the 2026 NBA draft.\n\nThe Oklahoma City Thunder sit atop the NBA standings, but that doesn't mean you can rest on your laurels. The reigning NBA champions vie to go back-to-back. And even with a pedestrian month, most expect them to enter the playoffs as the favorite.\n\nRegardless of how this season plays out, the Thunder are due for some roster changes this upcoming offseason. It comes with the territory of professional sports. If they want to remain a title contender, they must figure out how to recast their supporting players.\n\nShai Gilgeous-Alexander, Chet Holmgren and Jalen Williams will soon make up most of OKC's payroll. All three will have humongous new contracts kick in soon. One way to remain one of the league's deepest teams is by adding talent through the draft.\n\nWhile OKC's own draft pick will be in the bottom 10, the Thunder have their hands stuck in several pots of gold. The big one is the LA Clippers' first-round swap rights. Even though they've bounced back and are near .500, you never know what could happen in the draft lottery.\n\nWe'll see how the rest of the season plays out. The Peterson and Dybantsa dream has likely been burst with LA's hot run.

Academic Dishonesty, Political Selection, and Institutional Performance in China\n\n Zhuang Liu, \n\n Wenwei Peng \n\n & Shaoda Wang \n\n Working Paper 34747\n\n DOI 10.3386/w34747\n\n Issue Date January 2026\n\nHonesty is perceived as fundamental to societal functioning, motivating education systems worldwide to enforce strict oversight and heavy penalties for dishonest behavior. Yet much academic misconduct remains unexposed, and its broader consequences are further obscured by the sorting of individuals into careers based on probity. Applying advanced plagiarism-detection algorithms to half a million publicly available graduate dissertations in China, we uncover hidden misconduct and validate it against incentivized measures of honesty. Linking plagiarism records to rich administrative data, we document four main findings. First, plagiarism is pervasive and predicts adverse political selection: plagiarists are more likely to enter and advance in the public sector. Second, plagiarists perform worse when holding power: focusing on the judiciary and exploiting quasi-random case assignments, we find that judges with plagiarism histories issue more preferential rulings and attract a greater number of appeals — effects partly mitigated by trial livestreaming. Third, plagiarizing judges generate spillovers onto other judges and lawyers. Fourth, exploiting the staggered adoption of detection tools, we demonstrate that enforcing academic integrity leads to modest improvements in future professional conduct.\n\n Acknowledgements and Disclosures\n\nWe thank Ying Bai, Yiming Cao, Yunchien Chang, Chiman Cheung, Ruben Durante, Ray Fisman, Edward Glaeser, Guojun He, Andrew Kao, Muhammad Yasir Khan, Jonathan Klick, James Kung, Bingjing Li, Vincent Pons, Jesse Shapiro, Uta Schoenberg, Michael Song, Yongxiang Wang, Jaya Wen, Yanhui Wu, David Y.

    "fullText": "Melena refers to black tarry stools, which usually occurs as a result of upper gastrointestinal bleeding.\n\nIt has a characteristic tarry colour and offensive smell, and is often difficult to flush away. The change to the stool consistency occurs due to the alteration and degradation of blood by intestinal enzymes, resulting in melena.\n\nIn this article, we shall look at the differential diagnosis, clinical features and investigations for melena.\n\nMelena usually occurs as a result of an upper gastrointestinal bleed, however can also occur from bleeding occurring in the small bowel (albeit rare)\n\nThere are a number of causes for upper GI bleeding, however the most common are peptic ulcer disease, variceal bleeding, and malignancy.\n\nPeptic ulcer disease is the most common cause of melena (Fig. 1). Whilst it can affect any patient group, it should be especially suspected in those with known active peptic ulcer disease, a recent history of NSAID use or steroid use, or known H. pylori infection\n\nClassically, the most significant bleeding will occur if an ulcer erodes through the posterior gastric wall into the gastroduodenal artery. However, in reality, extensive bleeding can occur with the erosion of any blood vessel.\n\nOesophageal varices refer to dilations of the porto-systemic anastomoses in the oesophagus. They most commonly occur due to portal hypertension secondary to liver cirrhosis and are prone to rupture.\n\nThe most common underlying cause for oesophageal varices is alcoholic-related liver disease (ArLD), however can occur with any patient with chronic liver disease. Any melena occurring in a patient with a known chronic liver disease should be urgently investigated for potential variceal bleeding.\n\nUlcerating oesophageal or gastric malignancies (Fig. 2) can first present with melena, causing a gradual flow of blood that may present prior to any other cancer-associated symptoms.\n\nIn the assessment of any patient with melena, it is important to enquire about dysphagia, dyspepsia, weight loss, and relevant family history, potentially suggestive a diagnosis of malignancy.\n\nOther less common causes of melena include gastritis or oesophagitis, Meckel’s diverticulum, small bowel tumours, or vascular malformations (e.g. angiodysplasia).\n\nThe key facts to ascertain from a patient presenting with melena are:\n\nA digital rectal examination is essential to confirm the melena. A full abdominal examination must be performed, importantly to assess for peritonism, hepatomegaly, or stigmata of liver disease.\n\n*Patients on iron tablets will have black stool, so ensure to clarify the temporal sequence for any symptoms with the starting of iron tablets\n\nAll patients with suspected melena should undergo routine blood tests, including FBC, U&Es, LFTs, and clotting, to help investigate for underlying causes and to stratify overall risk.\n\nAny drop in haemoglobin and rise in the urea:creatinine ratio is very indicative of an upper GI bleed, as digested haemoglobin produces urea as a by-product and is readily absorbed by the intestine\n\nEnsure all patients with melena have a Group and Save performed, with those with any significant haemoglobin drop or haemodynamic instability having blood products cross-matched too.\n\nAll patients with new onset melena must undergo a gastroscopy (OGD) for further assessment. This will not only potentially identify the cause of melena, but also can allow for definitive interventions in certain cases (e.g. banding of varices)\n\nThe urgency by which an OGD is performed should be determined by the patients Glasgow-Blatchford bleeding score (GBS), used to risk stratify patients based purely on clinical and biochemical parameters.\n\nHowever, in certain cases, OGD may be inconclusive and therefore in those with ongoing melena, further investigations are required:\n\nIn the rare scenario that the above investigations are all normal, capsule endoscopy or RBC Scintigraphy may be considered for further investigations.\n\nIn any critically unwell patient, an A to E approach should be used to stabilise the patient prior to any definitive management steps.\n\nBlood products should be transfused to those who are haemodynamically unstable (urgently) or with a low haemoglobin. Any deranged coagulation should be corrected as appropriate, which may include use of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) +/- platelets, especially for those with impaired liver function.\n\nThe underlying cause identified will determine the necessary management option:\n\nYou’ve made a great start.

    "description": "Insiders reveal how Larry Ellison’s money turned Blair’s institute into a tech sales and lobbying operation for Oracle",
    "fullText": "After leaving office, Tony Blair founded such a flurry of initiatives, from charitable foundations to paid consultancies, that it’s been hard to bring the big one into focus. The Tony Blair Institute of Global Change (TBI) dwarfs the other work, just as it towers over other UK-based think tanks.\n\nMuch of the reporting on it has focused on Blair himself, ever newsworthy, his Davos lifestyle and meetings with the world’s rich and powerful. But the TBI isn’t just a UK concern, it’s now a global force working in at least 45 countries, employing other former heads of state, ex ministers and civil servants and paying more than a million dollars to its top earners.\n\nWhile previous Blair vehicles ranged around from development and peacebuilding to reputational work for petro-states, the TBI has an overwhelming focus: technology.\n\nThe ex-premier’s trademark evangelism is now focused on AI, its power to transform government –with his Institute now going as far as to try to build its own AI tools to sell to Gulf states– and why everyone should listen to Larry Ellison, the founder of technology firm Oracle.\n\nWhile the institute relies on Blair’s political brand, its money comes, in large part, from Ellison, who has had a remarkable 2025. He was briefly the richest man in the world in September, as Oracle’s stake in AI infrastructure drove its share price into orbit. In the 1990s Ellison was known as “the man who would be Gates” as he battled the Microsoft founder, Bill Gates, for pre-eminence. This year, the 81 year old has been feted by US President Donald Trump as the “CEO of everything” and an essay in the New York Times called him the billionaire “who will soon own the news” as his family’s media interests in Paramount-Sky Dance seem set to expand to include Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nEllison invested $130 million in the TBI between 2021 and 2023, with a further $218 million pledged since then. The scale of funding took the TBI from a headcount of 200 to approaching 1,000. Blair himself takes no salary from TBI but over this time the institute has been able to recruit from bluechip firms like McKinsey and Silicon Valley giants Meta. In 2018 before the Oracle founder’s funding surge, TBI’s best-paid director earned $400,000. In 2023, the last year where accounts are available, the top earner took home $1.26 million.\n\nBlair and Ellison have a relationship that goes back to the former’s time in office. In 2003 Ellison and Blair, then in his pomp, had a photo opportunity at Downing Street to mark a gift of supplies to 40 specialist schools. In tech circles this is known as “land and expand”. Oracle has since been contracted hundreds of times by the British government and earned £1.1 billion in public sector revenue since the start of 2022, according to data collected by procurement analysts Tussell.\n\nThe full extent of Ellison funding for the TBI became clear from the institute’s own accounts and a survey of US non-profit financial data, including that of the Larry Ellison Foundation, through which major donations were made to both the TBI and the Tony Blair Foundation.\n\nLighthouse Reports and UK partner Democracy for Sale then spent four months interviewing 29 current and former TBI staff, most on condition of anonymity, to build an insider account of the institute. This work included conversations with over a dozen former TBI employees who advised or drew up policy recommendations for governments across nine countries in the Global South and revealed how their work ranged from explicitly promoting Oracle’s services and acting as a “sales engine” to recommending tech solutions that are potentially harmful or bizarrely divorced from local realities. Former staff described a symbiotic relationship between TBI and Oracle, with the two entities holding joint retreats, and one ex-employee characterising them as “inseparable”.\n\nThis testimony was supported by public documents and those obtained under the UK’s freedom of information laws. Matched with interviews, they revealed an organisation unusually close to the British government, holding regular meetings with ministers in which they push policy recommendations that serve Oracle’s interests.\n\nThere is a reason why men whose fortunes are built on AI investments would target the UK, and that is the National Health Service (NHS) and its unique population-level health data. Tech experts talk about Britain’s health records in almost hushed tones. While Europe and the US have some comparable health data sets – such as US veterans’ medical records – none have the depth and breadth of NHS records dating back to 1948. Its potential commercial value, from drugs to genome sequencing has been estimated at up to £10bn per annum.\n\nWhen Labour came to power last July it did so promising economic growth and an end to the UK’s productivity crisis. Just five days after Keir Starmer was elected, Blair told the TBI’s ‘Future of Britain’ conference that AI was the “game-changer” they were looking for. Within months, Starmer was parroting Blair’s language – and the TBI was in the box seat of the government’s nascent AI policy pushing Oracle’s interests and its founder’s world view.\n\nThe FOI documents highlight two TBI staff who took direct, influential roles in government and reveal the institute’s influence over Peter Kyle, a former advisor in Blair’s second term, who was appointed technology secretary despite little experience in the sector, and came into office calling for governments to show “a sense of humility” to Big Tech companies.\n\nAt the same time the TBI’s policy director Charlotte Refsum was invited into the UK health department to meet digital policy chief Felix Greaves. She was later given an official role in a government working group advising on data and technology policy in Labour’s 10 year plan for the NHS.\n\nThroughout this period, the TBI has championed initiatives designed to unify public data, including a national data library (NDL). The NDL was little more than an idea when Labour put it in their election manifesto. And there are still competing visions for what it should be. AI boosters foresee data from across government used for training and inference by Large Language Models; while many tech experts want to minimise privacy risks inherent in pooling data from so many sources and ensure that any benefits accrue to the UK.\n\nEllison told Blair of his interest in NHS data when he was interviewed by him at the Dubai World Governments Summit in February 2025: “The NHS in the UK has an incredible amount of population data,” Ellison enthused, but it was “fragmented”.\n\nTwo weeks later, Blair’s institute published a report entitled Governing in the Age of AI: Building Britain’s National Data Library. In it, the not-for-profit institute echoed Ellison on the UK’s data infrastructure, calling it “fragmented and unfit for purpose”.\n\n“There is a real hard sell going on here that says: ‘these kinds of gains are inevitable.’ But they are not,” said Professor Gina Neff of Queen Mary University London. “TBI is not advocating for building that capacity within the NHS. They are saying: let’s outsource to our buddies.”\n\nMultiple staff working for TBI during the Ellison cash injection speak of a sea change in culture. McKinsey consultants took senior positions and clashed with staff from humanitarian and development backgrounds. Ex-employees say this led to the institute pivoting away from writing reports and recommendations by well-meaning development experts towards pushing aggressive tech solutions across the board.\n\nOracle and TBI’s connections are not just rhetorical. By 2023, joint retreats had become commonplace. At the institute’s headquarters at One Bartholomew Place in London, the teams would convene in the basement with executives from Oracle, Blair’s key advisor Macon-Cooney and Awo Ablo — who came to sit on the board of both TBI and Oracle sometimes present. Senior TBI employees have been hosted at Oracle’s headquarters in Austin, Texas, coordinated by a TBI employee whose role is to “scale and manage” the partnership with Oracle. Former staff recall that there were other earlier “hush hush” joint retreats at Ellison properties in the US.\n\n“It’s hard to get across just how deeply connected the two [organisations] are,” a former TBI staffer said. “The meetings were like they’re part of the same organisation.”\n\nAs the TBI’s partnership with Oracle deepened, employees told us they started to see Oracle staff started to slide into TBI employees’ calendars and schedule meetings in order to find out what the institute was doing in different countries and “scope out opportunities”, recalls one former TBI staffer. Soon employees from the two entities were having regular joint calls.\n\nThis sat uncomfortably with many TBI staff, with some describing having to push Oracle’s technology despite knowing they were not in the best interests of the country in question, and even had the potential to cause harm.\n\nThe risk of so-called vendor-lock in – tying a buyer to a single supplier – was a source of unease, with one former staffer saying that advising governments to use Oracle cloud services risked “trapping” and “indebting” them in systems that are “initially free but will start charging in future”.\n\nRwanda, a country where TBI has been present for more than 15 years, was so frustrated with Oracle that it issued a public tender in 2021 for a database management system, stating that it had been “experiencing a very high cost for support and licensing for Oracle systems and it would like to migrate to an affordable system”.\n\nMarvin Akuagwuagwu worked as a data analyst for TBI’s Africa Advisory unit in 2022 and 2023, focusing on Covid vaccine delivery. He said when he raised legitimate concerns, such as a lack of power supply and cyber security threats, when introducing new technologies to African countries these were dismissed by more senior colleagues.\n\n“I’m an African, I have lived experience, and I’m saying these things, but I wasn’t being listened to. You have to downplay those negative things,” he said.\n\nThis investigation was part of the series “The invisible Hand of Big Tech” led by Agência Pública and by Centro Latinoamericano de Investigación Periodística (CLIP), with the participation of 16 other organizations from 13 countries: ICL (Brasil), Núcleo (Brasil), La Bot (Chile), Primícias (Ecuador), Factum (El Salvador), Televisa N+ (Mexico), Cuestión Pública (Colombia), El Diario AR (Argentina), El Surti (Paraguay), IJF (Canada), Tech Policy Press (US), Tempo (Indonesia), Crikey (Australia), Daily Maverick (South Africa), Reporters Without Borders (International), El Veinte.",

    "description": "Small businesses struggled to observe the national shutdown to protest ICE. Here's why a boycott of companies like OpenAI and Amazon could be easier and more effective.",
    "fullText": "Economic boycotts are a familiar tool of protest. The problem is they often place the greatest strain on the smallest businesses.\n\nThat was the case during Friday's nationwide general strike, which was designed to pressure the Trump administration to dial back its aggressive anti-immigration policies.\n\nFor many small business owners, the shutdown created a dilemma. Supporting the cause often means losing a day's revenue and risking their ability to keep staff employed. Across social media, owners voiced solidarity alongside an apology for staying open.\n\nThere may, however, be another way, according to Scott Galloway, a marketing professor at New York University famous for his critiques of Big Tech.\n\nInstead of a blanket shutdown, Galloway is calling for Americans to focus on major tech companies by unsubscribing from — or opting out of — services like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Amazon's Prime Video, and Microsoft Office.\n\nA targeted boycott starting on Sunday and lasting the entire month of February could move markets, he says, which would, in turn, affect the CEOs who have the ear of President Donald Trump.\n\n\"We're proposing something quieter and less cinematic than a protest that will run all day on cable TV, but much more disturbing to the Trump administration. A one-day slowdown is irritating. A one-month slump is terrifying,\" he wrote in a blog post announcing the boycott.\n\nMajor tech CEOs have sought favor with the president during his second term. Many of them donated to his inauguration, for starters.\n\nAI executives, like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, also accepted an invitation to a White House dinner with Trump in September, where the leaders took turns lauding the president. Apple CEO Tim Cook and Amazon CEO Andy Jassy attended the White House premiere of the documentary about first lady Melania Trump at the height of January's anti-ICE protests in Minneapolis.\n\nSupporting the AI industry in its competition with China is a major pillar of Trump's economic agenda.\n\n\"These are the leaders who have his ear,\" Galloway writes. \"A modest reduction in their companies' growth could have a substantial impact on valuations priced to perfection. Small changes in consumer behavior — starting on the first day of February — could have an enormous ripple effect, one that extends all the way to the White House.\"\n\nRegular protests against the tactics of ICE and Border Patrol personnel have gripped the country for months. Thousands marched through Minneapolis again on Saturday. Tensions rose dramatically in January after the killings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti in Minneapolis, both at the hands of federal immigration agents.\n\nIn both instances, protesters recorded videos and posted them to social media for the world to see, leaving little room for the Trump administration to spin the events in its favor.\n\nWhile those videos and the subsequent protests — as well as the attempted nationwide shutdown — have spread awareness, they have so far done little to substantively shift the administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security demoted a key Border Patrol official last week and promised more changes. At the same time, however, the acting director of ICE expanded the power agents have to carry out warrantless searches, according to an internal memo seen by The New York Times.\n\n\"Real change always comes from the American people, not from our political parties. But power doesn't fear protests nearly as much as economic withdrawals,\" Galloway writes. \"Getting off your couch, taking to the streets, and building community is important, but the most radical act in a capitalist society isn't marching, it's not spending.\"",

    "title": "I moved back to Australia after decades in the US. The culture shock stunned me",
    "description": "After living in the US for decades, returning to Australia brought unexpected culture shock and forced me to rebuild a sense of home.",
    "fullText": "When I was in my early 30s, I went for a three-week holiday to my home in Sydney and never left.\n\nFor years, I had toyed with the idea of moving back home, a place I had not lived since I was 7 years old. I'd even made a couple of attempts at it, but the comfortable pull of family and more than 25 years of life in the US always lured me back.\n\nWhen extending my trip week by week turned into deciding to stay, I assumed slotting back into life in Australia would be the easiest move of my life. After all, I was used to adjusting to a new environment. My father's job in the film industry meant I spent my childhood moving frequently (13 different schools in multiple cities and countries).\n\nSurely moving back home would feel as comforting as slipping on a well-worn, much-loved cardigan. I was wrong.\n\nI never thought I would experience culture shock moving back to Australia, but that was exactly what happened. All my years overseas meant I had missed large parts of general knowledge, I didn't understand cultural references or sayings, and I found Australian politics completely befuddling.\n\nAlthough I still sounded Australian, a quick conversation, which inexplicably always started with \"where did you go to high school?\" quickly established I was not from here. After being viewed as a foreigner my whole life in the US, I was now viewed as a foreigner in Australia, too.\n\nWhat's more, I realized with surprise that I was culturally very American. All the things I had taken for granted in the US (convenience, customer service, and affordability) just didn't exist in Australia.\n\nThere were the daily frustrations of not being able to get a coffee past 3 p.m. (or before 7 a.m.), no salad bars or real Mexican food, and the expense of absolutely everything (Sydney is Australia's most expensive city).\n\nCultural norms were an even bigger adjustment. Handshakes for acquaintances and bear hugs for friends (standard etiquette in the US) were replaced with one or two kisses to the side of (not on) the cheek.\n\nMaking friends with Sydney-siders felt hard, so I initially gravitated toward foreigners who were generally open and friendly. When I'd meet Americans, I felt an innate level of comfort and familiarity unlike anything else.\n\nIn my first year back home, I thought a lot about the phrase \"you can never go home again.\" I'd always been pretty dismissive of it, believing I could return to Australia at any time and it would feel like home. Finally, I came to understand the truth in the phrase. We just can't return to a previous place or point in life and recapture our original experience.\n\nJust like I adjusted to the culture shock of moving to the US as a little girl (hello, mayo on sandwiches, ice in water, and excessive air conditioning), I needed to acclimatize to Australia. I had been making the move so much harder than it needed to be because I expected it to be easy and familiar.\n\nAs I started to let go of the expectation that I'd fit right in, I started to feel more at home, back home. I built up experiences and connections that grounded me, and as I got older, my American background became less noticeable and less relevant. It's taken a long time, but I now feel entirely at home here. In the end, the key was to start from scratch and get to know my hometown as an adult, rediscovering my Australian identity along the way.",

    "fullText": "You wouldn't wait until your 50s to start saving for retirement — so why wait until your heart is already at risk to start protecting it?\n\nHeart disease is spiking among younger people, in part because people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s are procrastinating on their health, according to Dr. Sadiya Khan.\n\nKhan, a professor of cardiovascular epidemiology at Northwestern University, told Business Insider that changes to your diet and exercise habits now can pay big dividends as you age.\n\n\"You can't just become older and then hope to make all these changes,\" she said.\n\nThe earlier you understand your heart health, the better equipped you are to make healthy decisions for future you.\n\nRight now, most of us are behind in our investments to our cardiovascular health. The average American's heart is 4 to 7 years older than their calendar age, according to Khan's research.\n\n\"All of us are naturally driven to procrastinate,\" she said. \"You try to worry about the things that are immediately in front of you, and it's harder to prioritize and give as much attention to something that is a long-term consequence.\n\nAn online tool, developed by Khan and her team, helps forecast a person's risk of heart attack or stroke over the next 30 years by illustrating how they stack up to their peers. It shows their percentile rank for heart health: in other words, out of 100 people the same age and sex, how many have a higher or lower risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nKhan said the new tool uniquely uses percentiles to help people manage their health by understanding their risk and making changes if needed. Patients can then prioritize which habits provide the best bang for their buck in terms of health benefits, starting with what Khan recommends most.\n\nKhan said a big challenge with heart health is that it can be highly individualized. All the factors involved — diet, exercise habits, genetics, and stress — can vary widely from person to person.\n\n\"It's not going to be a one-size-fits-all,\" she said. \"It's this overarching goal that we need to personalize how we communicate risk and how we can share that information in a way that works for each patient.\"\n\nThat makes it hard to recommend a specific game plan to boost everyone's heart health. However, there are a few strategies that can pay off for most people.\n\nFor best results, try to make small, sustainable changes that you can keep up over time.\n\n\"It depends on what works for you and what you are able to stick with,\" Khan said. \"They all matter, but you don't also need to do it all at once.\"",

    "fullText": "Hamburger chains dominated the fast-food sector in the 1980s and '90s after the \"burger wars\" launched among McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's.\n\nThe burger wars transitioned into an original chicken sandwich war, also in the 1980s, among the same three rivals. It was revived in the new millennium with Popeyes' launch of its chicken sandwich in August 2019.\n\nRival Chick-fil-A countered Popeyes' new sandwich with a statement on Twitter that its sandwich was the original, introduced in 1964, and fast-food chains everywhere began introducing or reintroducing chicken sandwiches.\n\nWith all of these chicken sandwiches launching, fried chicken restaurants became the most popular concept in fast food.\n\nFried chicken dining chains are likely to remain the most popular subsector of the fast-food industry in 2026, if the concept continues the trend it set over the last year.\n\nTraffic to chicken concepts rose 3% in the year ending September 2025, while all concepts dropped 1% compared to the previous year, according to market research firm Circana, as reported by Fast Company.\n\nThe variety of chicken options offered, such as chicken pieces, chicken fingers, or chicken sandwiches, and how consumers enjoy their choices, may contribute to the continued popularity of the concept, an expert says.\n\n“This is due to the experiences the brands are creating as well as the variety of chicken and how you can enjoy it,” industry expert Reilly Newman of Motif Brands told The Food Institute. “This comes to no surprise, as the experience economy has been taking root across the globe.\n\n“Chicken allows for (ample) customization, sauces, and forms, depending on the buyer’s preferences,” Newman said.\n\nNot every fast-food chicken restaurant benefited from increased traffic in 2025, as some operators suffered financial difficulties that led to bankruptcy filings.\n\nA bankrupt operator of more than 130 Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen franchise restaurants has closed 17 underperforming locations in Florida and Georgia and filed a motion to reject all of the stores' leases.\n\nThe franchisee, Sailormen Inc., which declared Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Jan. 15, filed a motion in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami to reject the leases after closing eight locations on Jan. 19, five locations on Jan. 20, and four locations on Jan. 22, according to court papers.\n\nThe debtor asserts that the leases should be rejected as of the petition date, since the restaurants were closed within one week of the petition date and before the hearing on the debtor's first-day motions.",

    "fullText": "Comedian and pundit Bill Maher was taken aback when a lone audience member cheered the arrest of independent journalist Don Lemon, exclaiming “It’s not good!”\n\nOn Friday night’s edition of HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher, the interview guest was  Nate Bargatze, comedian, actor, and host of the new game show “The Greatest Average American” and star of the upcoming film “The Breadwinner.”\n\nThe panel guests were Joe Scarborough, co-host of MS NOW’s “Morning Joe” and author of the daily newsletter “The Tea, Spilled by Morning Joe”; and former Republican congresswoman from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene.\n\nDuring the panel segment, Maher was running through a list of “fascist” things the Trump administration has done recently when he cited Lemon’s bombshell arrest:\n\nBILL MAHER: A viral video in Maine, ICE guy’s taking this woman’s, a picture of her license plate, and she says, why are you taking my information down? This is caught on tape, I guess, because they have the quote, “because we have a nice little database, and now you’re considered a domestic terrorist.”.\n\nThat is exactly what they do in fascist governments. Whenever you’re a protester, you’re actually an enemy of the state, and we arrest you. That’s what’s going on in Iran right now.\n\nSomebody went, “Yes,” like good, I don’t know. I don’t know. (AUDIENCE GROANS) It’s not good to arrest him! I don’t, you know.\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Well, I’m going to say he violated the FACE Act. He went into a church, disrupted their worship, and then later in an interview compared them to white supremacists. That’s not journalism. That’s activism. I had an experience with Don Lemon.\n\nBILL MAHER: What, does it warrant getting arrested?\n\nMARJORIE TAYLOR GREENE: Disrupting a worship service, stopping people’s right to worship God, that is violation of the FACES Act. And under the Biden administration, pro-lifers were sent to prison up to 11 years for praying in front of an abortion clinic and they were convicted under the FACE Act.\n\nSo I don’t think that’s journalism, that’s not First Amendment going in and harassing people in the middle of church. And you know, Don Lemon came to my office with the Tesla takedown guy that organized it and we had to call Capitol Police.\n\nBILL MAHER: Okay, but can we just charge him with not cool, man?\n\nWatch above via HBO’s Real Time with Bill Maher.\n\nThe post Bill Maher Stunned By Audience Member Cheering Don Lemon Arrest: ‘It’s Not Good! first appeared on Mediaite.",

What are you seeing?\n\nVERONICA MIRACLE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Yeah, it’s really intense here. And, Erin, I just — we just all got pepper sprayed. And so I’m just still recovering from that. There’s so much of the pepper spray still in the air and so, so many people around us coughing and gagging, including us.\n\nSo, it’s been a really interesting scene here. I’ve never seen this before in all of my years covering protests here in this area, here in downtown L.A., where they were actually, these protesters were able to get onto the property. There was a skirmish line of police officers of Department of Homeland Security officers. They were in a bit of a line, and the protesters overtook them and were able to basically push them further and further back all the way to the loading dock, where they essentially cornered all of them and pushed them back inside.\n\nThere was, you know, a bit of a skirmish. There were some pepper spray, people were throwing bottles, but ultimately these protesters have overtaken this property, which I have never seen before. Usually, police are here and they’re able to keep protesters off of the property.\n\nThis is a crowd that is kind of at the tail end of a very long protest. This started at 1:00 p.m. local over in city hall. Okay, I just got hit! Hold on, hold on. I just got — sorry.\n\nBURNETT: All right, take your time there, Veronica.\n\nMIRACLE: Sorry. I can’t breathe. I’m sorry.\n\nBURNETT: Take your time. Take your time. Right. Let’s just make sure Veronica’s okay.\n\nMIRACLE: Yeah. Sorry about that. Yeah.\n\nUNIDNETIFIED MALE; Let’s go back.\n\nMIRACLE: All right. So obviously, they’re — they’re shooting. They’re shooting something. Pepper balls or something. So, it looks like you can see an officer back there. He’s alone, and they’re just throwing things at him.\n\nI mean, it’s just pretty incredible that these protesters have overtaken this. And there’s really. There’s no police.\n\nI don’t see anybody here to kind of manage this crowd. So like I was saying, this is at the tail end of a very long day. It looks like they’re — they’re cheering because they were able to push that officer back inside. Okay.\n\nWatch above via CNN’s OutFront.\n\nThe post ‘I Just Got Hit!’ CNN Reporter Chokes Live On Camera As Trump ICE Agents Fire Irritants At Protesters first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S.",
    "fullText": "HAVANA, Jan 31 (Reuters) - Cubans from all walks of life are hunkering into survival mode, navigating lengthening blackouts and soaring prices for food, fuel and transport as the U.S. threatens a stranglehold on the communist-run nation.\n\nTogether, those discussions paint a picture of a ​people pushed to the limit as goods and services - particularly those tied to ever more limited fuel supplies - become scarcer and more expensive.\n\nFor much of rural Cuba, this is not entirely new. The island's frail and antiquated power generation system ‌has been slowly failing for years and residents have grown accustomed to spending hours at a time without functioning electricity, internet or water pumps.\n\nBut the seaside capital, where the streets are lined with 1950s-era cars and colorful if decrepit Spanish colonial architecture, has until recently fared better.\n\nNow crisis looks set to swamp it, too, as fuel shortages ‌take hold, with first Venezuela, then Mexico halting oil shipments to the island.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has said tariffs will be imposed on imports from countries that supply Cuba with oil, ratcheting up the pressure on Washington's long-time foe in the wake of the ousting of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, a key Cuban ally, in early January.\n\nIn many other countries, the conditions would have sent people out into the streets. So far, in a nation where dissent has long been curbed, there has been little sign of protest. But it is unclear how much more Cubans will be willing to endure.\n\nCuba's peso has lost more than 10% of its value against the dollar in three weeks, pushing up the price of groceries.\n\n\"This has put me in an impossible situation,\" said Yaite Verdecia, a Havana resident and housewife. \"There's no salary that can cope with this.\"\n\nDAILY LIFE GETTING ⁠MORE DIFFICULT\n\nTrump, when asked about the prospect of a U.S. military intervention in Cuba shortly after ‌the capture of Maduro, said he did not think an attack was necessary because \"it looks like it's going down.\"\n\nOn Friday, Cuba's Foreign Minister Bruno Rodriguez declared an \"international emergency\" in response to the U.S. tariff warning, which he said constituted \"an unusual and extraordinary threat.\"\n\nBut the government has said little about how it will manage the growing threat of humanitarian crisis.\n\nMany of the Cubans Reuters spoke with said daily life - already difficult - had ‍been reduced to basics like assuring food, fuel for cooking, and water, and that it had become noticeably harder in recent days.\n\nLines for gasoline have grown significantly this week at a handful of service centers in the city still supplied with fuel. And since the U.S. blocked Venezuelan deliveries of oil to Cuba in mid-December, virtually all gas has been sold at a premium, in dollars - a currency to which few Cubans have access.\n\n\"It used to be that you could sign up and get fuel once a month (in pesos),\" said Havana resident Jesus Sosa, referring to an app that would let residents know ​when it was their turn to fill up their cars. \"Not anymore. Sales in national currency have stopped.\"\n\n'YOU HAVE TO PAY THE PRICE OR STAY HOME'\n\nThe crunch has hit both public and private transportation, putting some buses and private taxis out of business and forcing ‌others to raise their prices.\n\nDaylan Perez, a 22-year-old who hails private taxis for clients in old Havana, said fewer buses mean people now have no choice but to pay rising fees for private transport.\n\n\"You have to pay the price or stay home,\" he said.\n\nEven transportation by electric vehicle - once thought to be a panacea in a city short of fuel - has been hit by blackouts that now last for eight to 12 hours or more.\n\nTaxi driver Alexander Leyet of Havana swapped to an electric three-wheeled taxi recently, thinking he had outsmarted the pack.\n\n\"Now because of the blackouts I can only charge my taxi for four or five hours,\" he said.\n\nFor decades, the government that has its roots in Fidel Castro's 1959 Cuban Revolution has survived despite sometimes brutal economic struggles, upending regular predictions of imminent collapse or an uprising.\n\nIt has long alleged a U.S.-led effort to foment revolt, but the most recent widespread protests were in the pandemic year of 2021, despite a 12% contraction of the economy between 2019 and 2024.\n\nSharp crackdowns on any form of dissent, combined with the emigration of between one and ⁠two million people since the pandemic, have all but eliminated organized in-country opposition. The Cubans interviewed by Reuters generally declined to answer questions about the prospect ​of protests.\n\nBut none of those interviewed disputed that change was necessary.\n\n\"I'm just praying God finds a way to get us out of this (mess),\" said Mirta ​Trujillo, a 71-year-old street vendor from Guanabacoa who burst into tears as she told Reuters she could no longer afford food. Previously, she had depended on a ration book of basic goods provided by the government, but that was phased out post-pandemic as tourist income and other sources of hard currency dried up.\n\n\"I'm not against my country... but I don't want to die of hunger,\" she said.\n\nOn a recent weekday evening, Reuters witnessed an ‍accident at a busy intersection in Havana where the stoplights were not ⁠functioning as a result of a power outage.\n\n\"Sometimes when the power goes out, accidents happen because the traffic lights don't work,\" said Raysa Lemu, whose apartment overlooks a boulevard in Marianao, on the outskirts of Havana.\n\n\"It used to be they turned off the power two or three times a week, but now it's every day and sometimes it's up to 12 hours.\"\n\nJulia Anita Cobas, a 69-year-old housekeeper from Guanabacoa, gets up at 4 a.m. each morning for a 10-mile (16-km) commute that now approaches four ⁠hours round-trip. With less public transportation available, the journey has become longer and more costly.\n\n\"I leave my house before sunrise and I don't know how I'll get back,\" she said.\n\nBut Cobas, who was born just before Castro's revolution, said she had no expectation that Trump would make things any better.\n\n\"Since I was born the (United States) ‌has been threatening us, and every day we deal with hardship. But we've survived it all,\" she said.\n\nAimee Milanes, a 32-year-old resident of Reparto Electrico, just outside Havana, said neither the Cuban nor the U.S. government offered her ‌much hope.\n\n\"We're drowning. But there's nothing we can do,\" said Milanes. \"This is about survival. Nothing else.\"",

    "fullText": "Ask a fan of any team in Scotland who they want their club to sign before Monday's transfer deadline and there will be one name which sticks out.\n\nWith 18 goals in all competitions, it is no surprise there are clubs rumoured to be circling like sharks in the water around the Motherwell forward.\n\nThe Zimbabwe rising star has been a revelation so far this season, currently standing alone as the league's top scorer with Jens Berthel Askou's side trailing Celtic by just two points.\n\nAt just 23 years old, his good years are ahead of him and Motherwell are in no mood to sell, with Maswanhise contracted until 2027. The club also hold an option for a further year.\n\n\"We have a game on Wednesday [against Dundee] and the business we plan to do doesn't really involve him,\" Askou said after Maswanhise's double secured a 2-0 win over Livingston.\n\n\"I never said he wasn't for sale, but I said we don't have a plan to sell him now.\"\n\nBut how long can Motherwell hold on to their star man? How much would force their hand, and could a big fish be tempted to meet that demand?",

    "fullText": "An \"emotional\" Shaun Murphy will aim to win a trophy named after a late friend after setting up a German Masters final against world number one Judd Trump.\n\nFormer world champion Murphy dispatched Neil Robertson 6-1 in their semi-final, and now has a chance to land the event's Brandon Parker Trophy - which commemorates his friend and manager who died of cancer in 2020.\n\nParker had been a key figure in promoting the event in Berlin, and its cup was named after him a year after his death.\n\nLooking ahead to Sunday's final, Murphy said: \"I get emotional thinking about Brandon all the time so the fact I'm out there playing won't change anything.\n\n\"It might give me a bit of escapism actually. I'll just concentrate on the snooker.\n\n\"It would be wonderful to take the Brandon Parker Trophy home. It would mean so much and possibly more to me than any other player on the tour.\"\n\nMurphy opened his semi-final with a 122 break and, after being pegged back in the next frame, hit two further centuries - 129 and 125 - on his way to a comfortable victory.\n\n\"For a lot of that match I was close to my best,\" he added.\n\nMurphy's dominant form carried over from earlier rounds, which saw him dispatch Kyren Wilson and Mark Allen with ease.\n\nIt will be a second German Masters final for Murphy, who lost to Mark Selby in 2015.\n\nIn Saturday's evening session at the Tempodrom Berlin, three-time German Masters winner Trump reached the final after beating Ali Carter 6-2.\n\nTrump took the first four frames before Carter fought back to make it 4-2.\n\nHowever, Trump was able to see out the match and move a step nearer a first trophy since the 2024 UK Championship.",

    "description": "Bitcoin fell toward $83,000 as the U.S. entered a partial shutdown, with traders leaning defensive ahead of a House vote expected Monday.",
    "fullText": "Crypto prices remained under pressure on Friday as the U.S. government entered a partial shutdown after lawmakers missed a midnight funding deadline, adding another layer of uncertainty to a market already struggling to find buyers.\n\nBitcoin traded around $83,559, up about 1% on the day but down roughly 6.8% over the past week, according to the price screen.\n\nEther sat near $2,686, down about 1.9% in the past 24 hours and 9% on the week. XRP changed hands near $1.72, down about 1.6% on the day and close to 10% lower over seven days.\n\nThe shutdown itself looks short. The Senate passed a funding package, but the House is out until Monday, so the government will still hit a technical lapse over the weekend.\n\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Saturday that it would operate with \"very limited staff\" from Jan. 31 onward due to the shutdown.\n\nThat timing matters for risk assets because it lands right into thin weekend liquidity and a heavy headline cycle, which may pressure bitcoin and the broader crypto market over the weekend.\n\nThere is also a clean crypto angle here that is not just “risk off.” Prediction markets have spent the past 24 hours showing how messy the definition of “shutdown” can get.\n\nTraders on Polymarket and Kalshi were forced to think like lawyers. The government can be “shut” on paper at 12:01 a.m. and still look normal to most people for two days. That gap between legal status and real-world impact is exactly where contract wording and settlement rules start to bite.\n\nFor crypto, the shutdown headline is more of a sentiment stress test than a direct economic shock. It keeps traders cautious, pushes people toward smaller position sizes, and makes dips feel heavier because buyers do not want to step in front of a weekend news tape.",

    "title": "Giant Virus Discovered in Japanese Pond May Hint at Multicellular Life's Origins",
    "description": "Did viruses create us?",
    "fullText": "Scientists in Japan have discovered a previously unknown giant virus, offering new insight into this enigmatic category of viruses – and possibly also into the origins of multicellular life.\n\nThe virus was found infecting an amoeba in a freshwater pond near Tokyo, the researchers report. They named it \"ushikuvirus\" after the pond, Ushiku-numa, located in Ibaraki Prefecture.\n\nGiant viruses were largely overlooked during the first century of modern virology, with initial discoveries often misidentified as bacteria due to their size. Yet while we barely knew they existed until recent decades, we've since learned giant viruses are all around us.\n\nViruses in general are considered the most abundant biological entities on Earth, and some of the most perplexing. Little is known about the evolutionary history of viruses, and there is still ambiguity about whether they qualify as living organisms.\n\nEven if they are not living, viruses clearly wield enormous influence over all forms of life, including us. That includes not just hijacking a host's cells and causing illness, but also occasionally meddling in its evolution.\n\nViruses can facilitate horizontal gene transfer among living things, and some – known as retroviruses – insert their DNA into the genome of host cells. If that happens in a host's germline, viral DNA can be passed on to its offspring.\n\nIn fact, ancient retrovirus remnants now comprise up to 8 percent of the human genome, which has its perks. Retroviral DNA might have given early vertebrates the ability to make myelin, and it was key for the evolution of the placenta.\n\nMuch earlier, viruses may have sparked an even bigger, more mysterious innovation: the evolutionary leap from prokaryotes, or single-celled organisms, to eukaryotes, or multicellular organisms.\n\nEukaryotic cells typically have a membrane-bound nucleus, representing a \"chasm in design\" from their nucleus-free prokaryotic forebears. It's unclear how such a dramatic change occurred, but one intriguing theory suggests that nuclei were a gift from viruses.\n\nKnown as viral eukaryogenesis, this idea was first proposed in 2001 by Masaharu Takemura, a molecular biologist at the Tokyo University of Science. He suggested the nucleus of eukaryotic cells arose from a large DNA virus, like a poxvirus, that infected some prehistoric prokaryote.\n\nInstead of causing trouble, the virus made itself at home in the cell's cytoplasm, eventually acquiring important genes from its host and gradually transitioning into a cellular nucleus.\n\nThis theory gained traction with the 2003 discovery of giant viruses containing DNA, which form structures called \"virus factories\" inside host cells. These factories are sometimes enclosed in a membrane and tend to look and function a lot like the nuclei of eukaryotic cells.\n\nScientists have since found a variety of these giant viruses, including species in the family Mamonoviridae and the closely related clandestinovirus, which infect certain types of amoebae. Giant viruses are highly diverse and difficult to isolate, though, so a new find like ushikuvirus is a big deal.\n\nTakemura is still investigating viral eukaryogenesis a quarter century after he introduced the idea, and was part of the team that identified and described ushikuvirus in the new study.\n\n\"Giant viruses can be said to be a treasure trove whose world has yet to be fully understood,\" Takemura says. \"One of the future possibilities of this research is to provide humanity with a new view that connects the world of living organisms with the world of viruses.\"\n\nUshikuvirus infects amoebae known as vermamoeba (Vermamoeba vermiformis), a habit it shares with clandestinovirus; while its shape and spiky capsid surface resemble those of medusaviruses.\n\nIt also stands out from other giant viruses, however. It forces its host cells to grow abnormally large, for example, and its capsid spikes have unique caps and fibrous structures.\n\nRather than preserving a host cell's nucleus and replicating inside, as clandestinovirus and medusaviruses do, ushikuvirus instead forms a viral factory and destroys the host's nuclear membrane.\n\nThese similarities and differences can be vital clues, helping scientists piece together the evolutionary history of giant viruses. Takemura and his colleagues hope to learn how and why these viruses diversified so much, as well as what role they played in the rise of eukaryotes like us.\n\n\"The discovery of a new Mamonoviridae-related virus, 'ushikuvirus,' which has a different host, is expected to increase knowledge and stimulate discussion regarding the evolution and phylogeny of the Mamonoviridae family,\" Takemura says.\n\n\"As a result, it is believed that we will be able to get closer to the mysteries of the evolution of eukaryotic organisms and the mysteries of giant viruses,\" he says.\n\nThe study was published in the Journal of Virology.\n\nMysterious Structure in Bird Eyes May Explain a Curious Lack of Blood\n\nFierce Storms Expose 19th-Century Maritime Mystery on Jersey Shore\n\nGreat White Sharks Grow Deadly New Types of Teeth as They Age",

He also gives us work-rate, so we keep him on the pitch.\"",

    "fullText": "A new study confirms that electrifying vehicles significantly reduces air pollution. Researchers from the Keck School of Medicine of USC found that for every 200 zero-emissions vehicles (ZEVs) added, nitrogen dioxide levels fell by 1.1% in California neighborhoods.\n\nThe research, published in The Lancet Planetary Health journal, used high-resolution satellite technology to measure air pollution from 2019 to 2023. The research team summarized their findings in a press release and touted the significant public health ramifications.\n\n\"This immediate impact on air pollution is really important because it also has an immediate impact on health,\" senior author Erika Garcia said. \"We know that traffic-related air pollution can harm respiratory and cardiovascular health over both the short and long term.\"\n\nTo that end, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure is linked to both cardiovascular risks, such as heart disease, and respiratory ailments, such as bronchitis and asthma attacks. While the same research team made suggestive links between ZEV adoption and reduced NO2 in an earlier study using ground-level monitors, this study went a step beyond with more definitive data sources.\n\nThis study divided California into 1,692 neighborhoods using DMV ZEV registration data and the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) for daily NO2 measurements. A typical neighborhood gained 272 ZEVs during the study.\n\nTo ensure the reliability of results, the study included several additional analyses. The research confirmed NO2 declines weren't solely due to pandemic-related changes. On the flip side, they also found that neighborhoods that added gas-powered vehicles saw an increase in NO2 pollution.\n\nThe study also suggests greater potential to further clean the air. ZEV registrations rose from 2% to 5% of light-duty vehicles in California during the study period, indicating that there's much room for improvement.\n\nNext, the study's authors will examine whether more ZEVs are associated with fewer asthma-related hospitalizations and emergency room visits.\n\nTheir work adds to the extensive research on whether EVs are better for the planet long-term than their gas-powered counterparts. Despite imperfections such as mining, the findings are clear on that front. The USC team is showing that when it comes to the air we breathe and public health, the benefits of EVs are undeniable.\n\n\"These findings show that cleaner air isn't just a theory—it's already happening in communities across California,\" declared Sandrah Eckel, the study's lead author.\n\nWould you be more willing to drive an EV with 500 miles of range?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed a bill Saturday that expands the state Supreme Court from five justices to seven as frustration has mounted among Republican lawmakers over a string of defeats before the tribunal.\n\nRepublican advocates for the change argued that it would help improve the court's efficiency. But legal experts said it could have the opposite effect and set a dangerous precedent at a time of tension between the branches of government. The state's judiciary did not ask for more justices on the high court.\n\nDemocrats, who were united in opposition to the bill, called timing suspicious. Last week the Legislature asked the court to overturn a redistricting ruling that gave Democrats a strong shot at picking up one of Utah’s four Republican-held congressional seats in the fall.\n\nNew justices could be in place when the court decides the fate of the congressional map.\n\nBecause the bill received approval from more than two-thirds of legislators, it took effect immediately after the governor signed it, allowing him to bypass a several-month waiting period to start adding justices.\n\nIn Utah, justices are appointed by the governor and approved by the state Senate. Justices in many other states are elected.\n\nMost states have five or seven Supreme Court justices, but a few have nine. Cox, a Republican, has said the additions would put Utah in line with other states of its size. He has denied that the policy is politically motivated, noting that Republican governors and senators have made all recent appointments.\n\nOnce he fills the new seats, Cox will have appointed five of the seven sitting justices.\n\nLast month Republican lawmakers took authority from state Supreme Court justices to select their own chief justice and gave that power to the governor.\n\n“Seven sets of eyes reviewing the most complex and difficult issues our state has ever faced is better than having only five sets of eyes,” said House Majority Leader Casey Snider, a Republican sponsor of the bill.\n\nJohn Pearce, who recently retired as associate chief justice, said this month that he doubted the change would make the court more efficient.\n\n“The more sets of comments you have to take into account, the longer the process takes,” Pearce said. “If what the Legislature is hoping to do is speed up the work of the court, it's going to be counterproductive.”\n\nTwo states — Arizona and Georgia — have added justices in the past decade after making similar arguments about efficiency.\n\nIn the first few years after Arizona grew its court in 2016, several past and present justices said it made things less efficient because more people had to review opinions before they could be published.\n\nArizona's court now issues slightly more rulings per year, while Georgia's issues slightly fewer than before.\n\nUtah Chief Justice Matthew Durrant told legislators on the opening day of the 2026 session that the court had “essentially no backlog” and urged them to add judges to lower courts, where the need is greater. Bill sponsors responded by adding some lower court judges and clerks.\n\nThe Utah State Bar has raised concern over the expansion and other proposals that it said would weaken the judiciary's independence. Among them is a bill that would create a new trial court with exclusive jurisdiction to hear constitutional challenges. The proposal would limit the ability of other judges and courts to block potentially unconstitutional state laws with injunctions.\n\nRepublicans have also been collecting signatures to try to place on the November ballot an initiative that would restore their ability to draw voting districts that deliberately favor a political party, a practice known as gerrymandering.\n\nLee reported from Santa Fe, New Mexico.",

    "fullText": "Jan 31 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court judge has dismissed a judicial misconduct complaint by U.S. Justice Department against a judge who clashed with President Donald ​Trump's administration over its move to deport several Venezuelans to El Salvador.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam ‌Bondi took the rare step in July of announcing the complaint against Chief U.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, D.C., alleging ‌he made improper comments about Trump during a meeting of the judiciary's policymaking body, the Judicial Conference.\n\nChief U.S. Circuit Judge Jeffrey Sutton of the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals in a newly-released order dated December 19 said the alleged statements, even if true, would not violate judicial ethics rules.\n\nThe Justice Department did not ⁠respond on Saturday to requests for ‌comment. Boasberg, an appointee of Democratic former President Barack Obama, declined to comment.\n\nBondi announced the complaint days after Boasberg said he might initiate disciplinary proceedings against ‍Justice Department lawyers for their conduct in a lawsuit brought by Venezuelans challenging their removal to a Salvadoran prison.\n\nBoasberg in April concluded the administration appeared to have acted \"in bad faith\" when it hurriedly assembled three deportation flights ​on March 15, at the same time that he was conducting emergency court proceedings to assess ‌the effort's legality.\n\nThe DOJ's complaint focused on comments attributed to Boasberg by the conservative media outlet The Federalist during a meeting of U.S. Judicial Conference in March that was attended by Chief U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.\n\nThe Justice Department alleged Boasberg expressed his concern to Roberts and others that the administration would disregard court rulings and trigger \"a constitutional crisis.\"\n\nThe DOJ argued those comments ran afoul of the ⁠judicial code of conduct, and that Boasberg wrongly acted ​on his belief in the litigation over the Venezuelans, who ​were removed from the U.S. under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nDue to potential conflicts among judges in D.C., Roberts transferred the complaint to the Cincinnati-based 6th Circuit's Judicial Council.\n\nSutton ‍said the DOJ lacked ⁠proof Boasberg made such statements, which even if uttered would not be improper during the judicial policymaking body's closed-door meeting.\n\n\"In these settings, a judge’s expression of anxiety about executive-branch compliance with ⁠judicial orders, whether rightly feared or not, is not so far afield from customary topics at these meetings—judicial independence, judicial ‌security, and inter-branch relations—as to violate the Codes of Judicial Conduct,\" Sutton wrote.",

    "fullText": "Britain's Josh Kelly put on a slick and brave performance to beat Bakhram Murtazaliev and win the IBF light-middleweight title by majority decision in Newcastle.\n\nIt was a trademark Kelly display as he danced around the ring, displaying devastating speed and high ring IQ - knowing when to engage and when to get on his heels.\n\nBoth fighters hit the canvas with Murtazaliev going down in the fourth and Kelly in the ninth. The Briton went down a further two times late in the fight, but both were ruled as slips.\n\nTwo judges scored the bout 115-111 and 114-113 in Kelly's favour with the other having it down as a 113-113 draw.\n\nMurtazaliev looked to have got to grips with Kelly's evasive style in the latter rounds, but the home fighter rallied in the last three minutes to end strongly.\n\nKelly, who becomes Sunderland's first world champion, sprinted to embrace trainer Adam Booth when the result was announced before grabbing the belt and raising it up to the 4,000-strong crowd.\n\n\"It feels like a dream. I envisioned this,\" Kelly told BBC Radio 5 Live.\n\n\"I was praying a couple of days ago, envisioned the fight, and I had deja vu of the knockdown in the tenth round.\n\n\"I had to concentrate - I feel overwhelmed. I need to take a second backstage to gather myself. I'm mentally exhausted.\"",

    "fullText": "A nor’easter is expected to bring heavier snow to coastal New Jersey and parts of Delaware this weekend.\n\nPhiladelphia and much of the I-95 corridor may see little snow if the storm stays on its current track.\n\nEven where snow is limited, strong winds and bitter cold could still impact the region.\n\nPHILADELPHIA - A nor’easter off the East Coast is expected to impact parts of New Jersey and Delaware this weekend, but forecasters say Philadelphia is likely to remain on the western edge of the storm, limiting snowfall for the city unless the system shifts.\n\nAccording to the FOX Forecast Center, the storm is expected to track offshore, keeping most snow well east of major population centers along the I-95 corridor.\n\nCurrent forecasts show the most significant snowfall for the region lining up along the South Jersey coastline and parts of coastal Delaware, while areas farther inland remain closer to the storm’s cutoff zone.\n\nFIND THE LATEST WINTER WEATHER FORECAST HERE\n\nForecasters stress that small changes in the storm’s track — even 50 miles east or west — could significantly alter snowfall totals, especially for cities like Philadelphia.\n\nThe highest snowfall totals are expected in coastal New Jersey, particularly shore communities, with snow also likely in parts of Delaware, especially closer to the coast, in the range of 1 to 3 inches.\n\nIn these areas, accumulating snow combined with gusty winds could create hazardous travel conditions, especially late Saturday into Sunday.\n\nThe National Weather Service says widespread minor coastal flooding is expected, along with strong northerly winds gusting 40–50 miles per hour along the immediate coast. Inland, wind gusts of 30–40 miles per hour are possible.\n\nFlooding in combination with frigid temperatures could pose the additional threat of tidal floodwaters freezing on roadways.\n\nIn Philadelphia, much of southeastern Pennsylvania, and western New Jersey, snowfall is expected to be lighter, with little accumulation expected.\n\nThese areas sit near a sharp snowfall gradient, meaning impacts could change quickly if the storm’s path adjusts.\n\nEven if snow largely misses Philadelphia, strong winds and very cold air will affect the entire region this weekend. Gusty winds could make temperatures feel much colder and create slick spots where light snow or earlier precipitation occurs.\n\nWind chills are expected to drop into the single digits and teens, increasing the risk of icy conditions on untreated roads and sidewalks.\n\nStay connected with FOX LOCAL.

Any shift in the storm’s path could bring heavier snow closer to the I-95 corridor or keep impacts confined to coastal areas.\n\nThis article was written using information from the FOX Forecast Center and FOX Weather reporting.",

    "description": "After Chelsea's first comeback win from two goals down in a Premier League match, were Liam Rosenior's substitutions against West Ham genius or obvious?",
    "fullText": "It has been some start to life as a Premier League manager for Liam Rosenior.\n\nSaturday's thrilling comeback win against West Ham was Chelsea's third league win in a row since the 41-year-old replaced Enzo Maresca at the start of January.\n\nAnd, in one of his biggest tests to date, it was his drastic half-time substitutions that led to the Blues recovering from 2-0 down to win 3-2 and moved them into the top four.\n\nAfter making seven changes from their midweek Champions League win in Napoli, a limp first-half display allowed relegation-threatened West Ham to deservedly take control.\n\nBut, making three half-time changes, Rosenior inspired a comeback in which substitutes Marc Cucurella and Joao Pedro hauled Chelsea level with a goal apiece - before Enzo Fernandez's dramatic stoppage-time winner.\n\nCriticism can be levelled at Chelsea for a poor first half in which they were booed off, fully deserved to be two goals down, and raised further questions about the quality of their squad.\n\nAfter the match, Rosenior played down the importance of his substitutions, instead crediting the mentality of the players since his arrival.\n\n\"My biggest learning is there's a spirit and a fight and a resilience in this group that I really, really like,\" he said. \"I've demanded that from the first day of stepping in.\n\n\"We haven't had many training sessions, but we've spoken about reacting positively to setbacks.\n\n\"We've spoken about reactions to losing the ball, pressing, energy, intensity. All of that was there in the second half, which wasn't there in the first half. I don't put that just down to the changes I made.\"\n\nOverall, Rosenior's early reign, now four weeks old, has been characterised by grinding out results and impactful in‑game adjustments.\n\nHis predecessor Maresca ended his tenure after a breakdown in relations with the ownership and having dropped a league‑high 15 points from winning positions - prompting frequent criticism of his mid-match decisions.\n\nFormer Chelsea winger Pat Nevin told BBC Radio 5 Live: \"Liam Rosenior went back to not exactly Chelsea's best team, but what Chelsea knew and the system they feel comfortable in. It now feels like tactical genius because they have won.\"",

    "fullText": "The sight of Noni Madueke flying past defenders and putting dangerous crosses into the penalty area will have been a welcome sight for Mikel Arteta.\n\nAnd Madueke's performance in Arsenal's 4-0 hammering of Leeds will have been even more well received, given that he was drafted into the starting line-up minutes before kick-off after Bukayo Saka picked up a hip injury in the warm-up.\n\nThe 23-year-old created Martin Zubimendi's opener, before seeing his corner punched into the Leeds net by goalkeeper Karl Darlow for the Gunners' second, as Arteta's men moved seven points clear at the Premier League summit.\n\nMadueke was signed by Arsenal from Chelsea this summer - with some fans questioning the move - in a bid to strengthen their squad depth and provide cover should key man Saka pick up injuries.\n\nAnd the England winger showed in his 60 minutes on the pitch just why the club made that decision.\n\nArteta said: \"He was ready. Because you cannot do that in two minutes. The way he prepares, the way he's waiting for opportunity, I think paid off today because he really impacted the team.\"\n\nWhile Arsenal are waiting for a diagnosis on the extent of Saka's injury, Madueke will be hopeful he has earned another start for Tuesday's EFL Cup semi-final second leg against former club Chelsea.\n\nSaka and Madueke are also competing for a place for England as the summer's World Cup approaches. So will the latter now get the chance to start staking his own claim?\n\n\"Noni Madueke was really good, especially when you come so late into the game,\" former England midfielder Fara Williams told the BBC's Final Score.\n\n\"It is an opportunity for him and he has performed well. When he went in at Arsenal and Saka got injured, he had an opportunity to get some games, then he got injured himself.\n\n\"When he has been playing for England, he has shown what he can do. He will be a headache for both managers, Mikel Arteta and Thomas Tuchel, in the summer.\"\n\nEx-Manchester United striker Dion Dublin added on Final Score: \"Bukayo Saka and Noni Madueke are both internationals, and both doing an incredible job.\n\n\"Saka will likely start [for Arsenal and England] because he is the better of the two, and he is more consistent.
