    "fullText": "Bayern Munich are in “intensive talks” with star striker Harry Kane over his future but proper renewal talks are yet to take place, board member for sport Max Eberl said on Tuesday.\n\nKane, 32, came to Munich in 2023 from Tottenham Hotspur and has a contract until 2027. The England captain has scored 123 goals in 129 matches for the Bundesliga champions and leaders.\n\nKane has said on several occasions that he and his family feel very much at home in Munich and that there was no need to rush into contract talks.\n\nNews reports have spoken of interest from Saudi Pro League clubs and Eberl was asked about Kane's situation on the eve of Bayern's German Cup quarter-final against RB Leipzig.\n\n\"We're talking, that doesn't mean negotiations have started. We're in intensive talks with Harry, then the next steps will follow,\" he said.\n\nEberl didn't want to comment on the rumours, saying: “All I can say is that we are in close contact with Harry regarding him and our success.”\n\nEberl was also asked about veteran goalkeeper Manuel Neuer and Dayot Upamecano whose contracts expire in summer.\n\n\"Manu turns 40 in March and then we'll see at the end of the season what happens next,\" Eberl said of Neuer, who is yet to decide whether he wants to continue or not.\n\nLong talks with France defender Upamecano appear to have been successful and that his decision would also affect Bayern's summer transfer activities.\n\n\"With Upa we're getting closer and closer,\" Eberl said. \"If it works out with Upa, we know we're well set in the defence for next season.\n\n\"And then we know we may not have to make an external transfer in this position. Then we could have more chances in another position.\"",

    "description": "You’ve reached the Derek Carr portion of the Minnesota Vikings’ offseason. The veteran signal-caller entered the purple rumor mill this […]",
    "fullText": "You’ve reached the Derek Carr portion of the Minnesota Vikings’ offseason. The veteran signal-caller entered the purple rumor mill this week after reports indicated that the 34-year-old may want back in the big leagues.\n\nIt’s probably smoke, but Carr’s name fits the offseason carousel: a veteran bridge, a familiar resume, and a reasonable price tag.\n\nNeeding a quarterback to partner with J.J. McCarthy in 2026, the Vikings, in theory, could explore what it would take to pry Carr away from the New Orleans Saints, who still own his contractual rights. Carr previously retired last May.\n\nEvery avenue at QB has been exhausted for the Vikings’ rumor mill this offseason, and we’re only a month in.\n\nCarr will be a name in the quarterback carousel this offseason. NFL.com reported Monday, “As quarterback injuries mounted this season and into the playoffs, teams conducted due diligence on Carr, trying to gather information as to whether the former Saints franchise passer would consider coming out of retirement, sources tell The Insiders.”\n\n“The Bengals, for instance, contacted Carr after Joe Burrow went down with his turf toe injury. That work continues, and an offseason of quarterback uncertainty — with limited options in free agency, trades and the draft — makes Carr a possible solution in the right situation.”\n\nCarr started 10 games for the 2024 Saints, fired up a 15-touchdown to 5-interception split, and his team finished 5-5 on his watch.\n\nNFL.com continued, “The Saints still hold Carr’s rights, though Tyler Shough’s impressive rookie season, the amicable end to Carr’s time in New Orleans and the way the sides worked through any salary-cap issues add up to his tolled contract being an unlikely hurdle in the process.”\n\n“The Saints could ask for compensation in a trade, though the price surely wouldn’t be an unreasonable ask for a player who has no future in New Orleans.”\n\nThere is no explicit interest from the Vikings in Carr; we haven’t reached that juncture of the offseason. That’s a few weeks away, if any.\n\nBut that didn’t stop Vikings-themed websites and voices from running with the Carr-to-MIN theory. For example, Minnesota Sports Fan‘s Eric Strack wrote, “Obviously, Cincinnati won’t be a landing spot for Derek Carr anymore. But I know a place that would be. Out of all the quarterbacks the Vikings could go for, Carr might be the best realistic option, if he really is as healthy as Rapoport claims he is.”\n\n“The Vikings have made it abundantly clear to other teams and NFL insiders that ‘all bets are off’ this offseason, in their search for a veteran quarterback. And if you put Carr up against Kirk Cousins or Mac Jones… he might be the best of all three options.”\n\nVikings-oriented social media accounts, especially on X, ran with the Carr idea.\n\n#Saints QB Derek Carr could unretire if the right situation and coaching staff presents itself, per @RapSheet. \n\nDo you think the #Vikings should try to lure Carr out of retirement? pic.twitter.com/HKGkOSEOtQ\n\n— VikingzFanPage (@vikingzfanpage) February 9, 2026\n\nNJ.com‘s Chris Franklin named the Vikings and the Dolphins as two clubs that express interest in Carr. He noted on Minnesota, “Another team to watch would be the Minnesota Vikings. Last year’s starter J.J. McCarthy struggled mightily, completing just 57.6% of his passes for 1,632 yards, 11 touchdowns and 12 interceptions.”\n\n“Vikings head coach and offensive play-caller Kevin O’Connell will need to boost his offense to not only keep him off the hot seat but also to maximize the talent of wide receiver Justin Jefferson, who had career lows in receiving yards (1,048) and touchdowns (two). The Vikings would also have to hope their banged-up offensive line, including left tackle Christian Darrisaw and center Ryan Kelly, remains healthy.”\n\nScaled to a 17-game season, Carr’s numbers, on average, look like this since his career began in 2014:\n\nIt’s worth noting that the average includes his prime years; Carr will be 35 when the 2026 regular season begins.\n\nHere’s his NFL ranking per season in EPA+CPOE in the last decade:\n\n2016: 16th\n2017: 19th\n2018: 18th\n2019: 7th\n2020: 10th\n2021: 15th\n2022: 21st\n2023: 15th\n2024: 13th\n\nWith that efficiency, Carr would likely drag Minnesota to the postseason but stumble before the Super Bowl — a story fans know too well.\n\nJust Another Name in the Hopper\n\nFor now, Carr is just another name for the Vikings to consider in an offseason when they want to sign or trade for an extra quarterback. McCarthy will need an insurance policy or outright competition. Carr can provide either.\n\nThe annoying part of the blooming Carr sweepstakes is the Saints’ control. His next team must work out terms to take him away from New Orleans, and that might involve a draft pick. Most expect that draft capital to be negligible — like a 6th- or 7th-Round selection — but it won’t be as easy as signing Carr from free agency. The Saints hold the cards.\n\nCarr has thrown for over 4,000 yards in a season four times.\n\nMinnesota will operate this offseason, at least for a while, without an official general manager after Kwesi Adofo-Mensah was fired on January 30th. Rob Brzezinski holds an interim title, and he’s worked for the Vikings since 1999.",

    "fullText": "Mercedes driver Kimi Antonelli escaped “unhurt” after being involved in a car crash near his home.\n\nThe F1 team said the 19-year-old Italian’s car was the only vehicle involved in the incident in San Marino on Saturday night.\n\nThe Italian newspaper La Gazzetta dello Sport reported that an investigation had been opened after an exclusive Mercedes supercar crashed into a road-side retaining wall, with the vehicle suffering “extensive damage”.\n\n\"We can confirm that Kimi was involved in a traffic accident on Saturday night close to his home in San Marino,\" Mercedes said. “The police attended the scene, after being called by Kimi.

The Italian, who replaced Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes after he left for Ferrari, passed his driving test in January last year shortly before the start of his rookie season in F1.\n\nMercedes finished second in the constructors’ championship last year - despite winning just two races - with George Russell fourth behind world champion Lando Norris and title contenders Max Verstappen and Oscar Piastri and Antonelli seventh behind Ferrari’s Charles Leclerc and Hamilton.",

    "description": "While not the middle of the order power bat we expected, Durbin offers a lot in terms of speed, defense & balls in play.",
    "fullText": "Caleb Durbin is an infielder who played college baseball at D-3 Washington University (in St. Louis) and was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the 14th round of the 2021 draft. He was traded from Atlanta to the Yankees after the 2022 season for Lucas Luetge, and then again to Milwaukee after the 2024 season as part of a package that landed Devin Williams. A year later, Durbin comes to the Red Sox from the Brewers, along with fellow infielders Anthony Siegler and Andruw Monesterio and the 67th draft pick (Comp B), in return for pitchers Kyle Harrison and Shane Drohan, and infielder David Hamilton.\n\nIt depends on where you’re setting your expectations. If you’re looking for the middle-of-the-order power bat that Craig Breslow stressed was a top need on multiple occasions, you’re not going to find that with the 5’7”, 183 lb. Durbin.\n\nWhat you will find is someone with an average-to-plus hit tool, who can make the plays defensively at multiple positions, with a lot of speed on the bases. Durbin slashed .256/.334/.387 in his rookie season, with 11 home runs and 18 stolen bases, which led to third place in Rookie of the Year voting.\n\nThe ball is usually put into play when Durbin is at the plate. He was one of only five qualified hitters in all of MLB who had less than a 10% strikeout rate (9.9%), but also had just a 21st percentile walk rate (5.9%). On Monday, Breslow noted Durbin’s Air Pull%, which is well above average at 20.4%. For a right-handed hitter at Fenway, that’s never a bad thing, both for home runs and for doubles.\n\nDefensively, Durbin started 119 games at third base, but just three games at second base for the Brewers in 2025. He was a +5 in Defensive Runs Saved at 3B, but was exactly in the middle of the range with a “0” in Outs Above Average on Statcast. He can also play shortstop in a pinch. With an emphasis on a staff filled with groundball pitchers, Durbin should be part of an improvement on the defensive side in 2026.\n\n136 G, 506 PA, .256/.334/.387, 11 HR, 53 RBI, 60 R, 18-for-24 SB, 5.9 BB%, 9.9 K%, 105 wRC+, 2.6 fWAR\n\nHere’s a walk-off homer by Durbin against the Padres on June 7th of last year. And, really, what’s better than a walk-off homer?\n\nHe’s getting hit by a pitch, something that Durbin can do with the best of them. He led the National League with 24 HBPs a season ago. While that may seem like a flukey stat, there is an art to getting hit by a pitch. If you have ever had a teammate who got hit by a ton of pitches and always found a way to make it look like an accident, you know what I’m talking about. Durbin had double-digit HBPs in each of his three minor league seasons, in significantly fewer plate appearances.\n\nIn fact, the Red Sox have brought the top two in HBP over from the NL, as new first basemen Willson Contreras was hit by 23 pitches a year ago. Is it possible that this was intentional?\n\nIn Durbin’s case, as mentioned earlier, his 5.9 BB% was in the bottom quarter of the league. But what if you include his 4.7 HBP%? A “walk rate” of 10.6% doesn’t sound so bad, and it’s a higher rate than Durbin strikes out at. In general, hit batsmen happened on 1.1% of the plate appearances in MLB in 2025, and Durbin was drilled at more than 4X that rate.\n\nThere were no definitive answers on day one from Red Sox executives, nor Alex Cora. It seems like Durbin would slot in at either second or third base, with Marcelo Mayer playing at the other spot. Upon prospect graduation, the 6’3”, 188 lb. Mayer had a 60-grade arm on Baseball America, where Durbin had a 50-grade arm. My best guess is that Mayer, with more size and a bigger arm, will play third base with Durbin starting at second, a position that he played the majority of the time coming up through the minor leagues. When left-handers are on the mound, Mayer may take a seat in favor of second baseman Romy Gonzalez, which may slide Durbin over to third base on those days. Roster Resource currently projects Durbin to hit seventh in the lineup behind Carlos Narvaez and ahead of Mayer, at least against RHP.",

    "fullText": "Jazz blatant tanking strategy with Jaren Jackson Jr., Lauri Markkanen backfires in funny way originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Utah Jazz look like they're going to stick with a simple strategy to try and improve their NBA Draft position, or at least stay right where they are.\n\nJaren Jackson Jr. and Lauri Markkanen aren't playing fourth quarters right now. That's an easy way to try and tank.\n\nThey let the star big guys play their game until sometime in the third quarter. Then they come out, and they don't go back in the game.\n\nIt worked the first time they did it, but Monday night, it backfired in a goofy way.\n\nMORE: These highlight of 12-year old LeBron James are spectacular\n\nThe problem is that the Jazz still have to put five players out on the floor, and on Monday, the reserves maintained the lead against the Miami Heat in a 115-111 win.\n\nJackson and Markkanen left with a lead, having scored 22 and 17 points, respectively, each in just 25 minutes.\n\nThen it was bench guys like Kyle Filipowski, who had 16 points and 11 rebounds, who made up for their sitting.\n\nMORE: This NBA Dunk Contest field is one of the worst ever\n\nEven the rookie Ace Bailey, who hasn't been particularly consistent this season, went for 16 points and eight rebounds in a team-high 37 minutes.\n\nThe Heat have much more to play for right now, so the Jazz probably assumed that weakening their lineup may let Miami back in the game, but not on this night.\n\nAnd for what it's worth, Jazz coach Will Hardy was asked after the game by a reporter how close he was to bringing Jackson and Markkanen back in as the game got close. \"I wasn't,\" replied Hardy.\n\nYep, they aren't hiding it at all. The Heat just managed to not let it work on Monday.\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo's legacy doesn't change despite messy trade rumors\n\n'Worst shooting form of all time' draws comparisons to Lonzo Ball, Shawn Marion\n\nBulls' newest player made the most embarrassing play of the season\n\nJarrett Allen is next to Wilt Chamberlain in surprise NBA history\n\nJames Harden's Cavs debut makes history already\n\nJazz show exactly how to tank properly",

    "fullText": "Another weekend, another win for Liam Rosenior, who now has seven from his first nine games as Chelsea boss.\n\nThe team haven't been convincing in all of them - in fact, you could argue they're yet to put in a full 90-minute performance with the new manager in charge. But the victory over Wolves showed all of the same positives we've seen developing over the last month, with new ones added.\n\nJoao Pedro continues his improved form, this time with two penalties won rather than a goal. Building on that existing trend was his increased chemistry with Cole Palmer. Not only was Palmer the man who put both spot-kicks away, but he also showed more understanding of his team-mate's movements in open play.\n\nMore fluidity and conviction in attack was what everyone was asking for, and on Saturday they got it - at least in the first half, before Chelsea eased off in the second period. The Andrey Santos and Moises Caicedo double-pivot has already added a lot of fortitude to the shape, as has the Wesley Fofana and Trevoh Chalobah pairing at the back. Robert Sanchez has been given more protection by the block of four ahead of him, and has responded with good form of his own.\n\nIf that solid spine can keep up their good performances and the attack continues to develop ahead of them, there's no telling where this season could end up. The Blues have closed the gap at the top of the Premier League table and qualified for the Champions League knockouts.\n\nAfter facing Leeds and Hull City, they also reach their first free midweek since Rosenior came in, with an international break in March also on the horizon. That provides even more opportunity for performances to catch up with results, and for the positive mood at Stamford Bridge to continue to grow.\n\nFind more from Will Faulks at Chelsea News",

    "description": "O'Shea broke his foot in March, Kam suffered a concussion in July, and they weren't back competing in top form until October. They just won a gold medal for Team USA anyway",
    "fullText": "Danny O'Shea and Ellie Kam tell PEOPLE about their hard-earned road to Olympic gold\n\nThe pair talk about how they didn't let O'Shea's broken foot or Kam's concussion get in their way\n\nThe pair won gold in the figure skating team event on Feb. 8\n\nJust several months ago, Team USA figure skaters Danny O’Shea and Ellie Kam’s dreams of winning gold at the 2026 Winter Olympics were in jeopardy.\n\nO’Shea, 34, was fresh off surgery for a broken foot — and as soon as he returned to the ice, Kam, 21, suffered a major concussion when she fell to the ice on her head, leaving her sidelined for a month. Still, the duo persevered, and on Feb. 8, took home a gold medal in the team event, proving that sometimes, believing in yourself is the best medicine.\n\n“This whole season has been a lot of ups and downs for both Danny and I,” Kam, 21, tells PEOPLE at the Starbucks Winter House on Monday, Feb. 9 after their win. “We had a lot of injuries in the offseason and coming into this year, you know what it would mean to perform well and make it to an Olympic team and have the chance to represent the country. You want that so bad… and at times it felt like we were so far away from that end goal, and it felt like we were getting farther instead of closer.”\n\nThe pair’s roller coaster journey first started to go off the rails in March, when O’Shea broke his foot doing off-ice jumps just 48 hours before he and Kam left for the 2025 World Championships. They finished seventh, which helped earn Team USA a third Olympic spot in Milan, but O’Shea had to undergo surgery afterward, and needed two plates and 11 screws, according to U.S. Figure Skating.\n\nThen, on July 18, just weeks after O’Shea returned from his injury, Kam suffered one of the worst concussions of her life when she fell on her head during practice, which kept her off the ice for a month. She and O'Shea were forced to pull out of a major opportunity in August, and withdrew from a competition in New York in September. The two weren't back on the ice competing at a top level until October — just four months before the Olympics.\n\n“[Talk about] resilience. Not just pure hard work, but overcoming another roadblock, another roadblock, another roadblock. We got disheartened for sure,” O’Shea tells PEOPLE. “But [we were] not allowing that to stop us from continuing forward.”\n\nKam adds that she and O’Shea, who have been skating together since 2022, kept their eyes on the prize, and maintained a positive attitude despite all that life threw at them.\n\n“I think that we did such a good job at staying together as a team and trusting the process. We had a competition that was really rough in the beginning, but I think that that was all just part of the plan,” she says. “In order to get to the high point of success, you have to go through the nitty-gritty, the dirty… It just makes me even more proud of wearing this medal around our neck, because I know what type of work it has taken us to get here. We worked so hard.”\n\nThe two were a major part of Team USA’s team event win, earning seven team points for their pair skating routine. They ultimately took home medals alongside teammates Madison Chock, Evan Bates, Alysa Liu, Amber Glenn and Ilia Malinin.\n\nO'Shea and Kam will aim to add to their medal collection on Monday, in the final night of the pairs skating competition.\n\nTo learn more about all the Olympic and Paralympic hopefuls, come to people.com to check out ongoing coverage before, during and after the games.

    "title": "All About the New Sport and Medal Events Featured at the 2026 Olympics",
    "description": "Ski mountaineering is making its debut at the 2026 Winter Olympics",
    "fullText": "The 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics kicked off on Feb. 6 and will feature several returning sports\n\nIn addition to traditional events, the Games will also introduce the new sport of ski mountaineering\n\nMany women's and team events have also been added to existing sports\n\nThe 2026 Winter Olympics is introducing the first new sport in nearly three decades!\n\nIn addition to adding various medals and events within existing sports, the Olympics added ski mountaineering to its roster for the 2026 Milan Cortina Games. The sport, which is also called \"skimo,\" is a combination of mountain climbing and skiing.\n\nWhile ski mountaineering is the only official new sport, the 2026 Games also introduced a variety of medal opportunities in the men's, women's and team categories for a number of existing sports. Between the new sport and fresh events, there are a total of 10 additional medals up for grabs.\n\nHere's everything to know about the new sport and medal events at the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n\nSki mountaineering is the only new sport to join the 2026 Winter Olympics. The sport, which is also referred to as \"skimo,\" is a skiing event that combines climbing and skiing on mountains.\n\nAthletes must maneuver through the challenging rugged course while attaching and unassembling their skis over and over again.\n\n\"The concept of ski mountaineering is fairly simple: Competitors climb up a mountain on skis and by foot, then descend on skis. Whoever crosses the finish line first wins,\" Team USA wrote in a description. \"Athletes follow a designed course throughout the race, and they must navigate terrain that is more rugged than that in a traditional cross-country or alpine ski race.\"\n\nThe 2026 Olympics will include three medal events within ski mountaineering: men's sprint, women's sprint and mixed gender relay. The sprints will cover over 250 feet of elevation where athletes will race up and down the designated course in just a few minutes.\n\nMeanwhile, the mixed gender relay occurs on a longer course of around 500 feet and features one male and one female athlete taking turns running the course.\n\nThe ski mountaineering competitions will be held in the Valtellina Valley town of Bormio, which is the same location as alpine skiing. The sprints are scheduled for Feb. 19, while the mixed gender relay will take place on Feb. 21. Team USA has two athletes, Anna Gibson and Cam Smith, who qualified in December 2025 for both the mixed gender relay team and individual sprints.\n\nFreestyle skiing has been an Olympics medaling sport ever since it was introduced in the 1992 Albertville Winter Games, but it has expanded with two medal events — men's and women's dual moguls — for 2026.\n\nUnlike traditional moguls in freestyle skiing, the dual moguls feature a total of 30 athletes broken down into brackets of two athletes competing side-by-side at a time. In every bracket, the two designated skiers directly compete against each other as they perform tricks and run down the set course.\n\nAfter they embark on simultaneous runs, the skiers are judged against each other on the same factors as traditional moguls — including turns, speed and air. The winner is determined by judges — who all have five votes they can divide between the athletes — and whomever has the most votes moves on to the next round.\n\nFor the Milan Cortina Olympics, the same athletes will be competing in both traditional moguls and dual moguls, so all 30 qualified competitors have two chances to win a medal, per NBC Olympics. The Team USA mogul skiers include Olivia Giaccio, Tess Johnson, Jaelin Kauf, Liz Lemley, Charlie Mickel, Nick Page, Dylan Walczyk and Landon Wendler.\n\nThe women's dual moguls finals are scheduled for Feb. 14 and the men's finals are slated for the following day, Feb. 15.\n\nAnother medal event that viewers will witness for the first time is the women's doubles luge. The sport has been a staple at the Winter Olympics ever since the 1964 Games and included men's singles, women's singles and doubles.\n\nAlthough women were not explicitly ineligible from the doubles portion of the event, no women had previously competed, and it had traditionally been a men's event.\n\nThe women's double luge will resemble the men's in that two athletes will team up and lie on their back while riding a single sled and steering it with their bodies at extremely high speeds. Similar to other luge events, the team with the lowest cumulative time after two separate runs wins.\n\nLongtime partners Chevonne Forgan and Sophia Kirkby will make history by representing Team USA in the historic event on Feb. 11.\n\nSkelton, the high-speed sledding event where athletes lie on their stomach and race head-first down an icy course, was first introduced in the Winter Olympics in 1928 but wasn't included as an official sport until 2002, with both men's and women's events.\n\nFor the first time since then, skeleton has launched a mixed team relay. The new event features pairs made up of one man and one woman from the same country. In a single heat, the woman will begin the course before the man immediately follows.\n\nBoth individual times are combined into a final team time, and the lowest time among competitors wins. Team members Mystique Ro and Austin Florian will be competing on behalf of the U.S. on Feb. 15.\n\nAnother sport that has added a women's event is the large hill ski jumping program. The men's large hill event has been a signature sport at the Games ever since the inaugural Winter Olympic Games in 1924.\n\nThe men's normal hill event was later added in 1964, and the women's portion of that competition emerged in 2014. However, the women's large hill event was absent until the 2026 Games.\n\nThe women's large hill ski jumping event features female athletes launching themselves from a large ramp (around 400 feet tall). A panel of judges determine the winners based on several factors, including distance, speed and style.\n\nAnnika Belshaw, Paige Jones and Josie Johnson will compete in the inaugural ski jumping event with Team USA on Feb. 15.\n\nAlpine skiing, which has been part of the Olympics since 1936, introduced a team combined medal event in 2026.\n\nThe team event consists of two athletes working together to race two runs: a downhill and a slalom. One member of the team races the downhill, while the other takes on the slalom. The pair with the fastest cumulative time takes home the gold.\n\nThe new event replaced the super combined event, which showcased just one athlete competing in both portions of the race. The 2026 Olympics will include an event for both women and men's teams.\n\nThe men's inaugural event, which took place on Feb. 9 at the Stelvio Ski Centre, resulted in Switzerland's Franjo von Allmen and Tanguy Nef winning gold. Team USA duo Kyle Negomir and River Radamus competed and placed 16th.\n\nMeanwhile, the women's events, held on Feb. 10, will feature Team USA pairs Breezy Johnson and Mikaela Shiffrin, Jacqueline Wiles and Paula Moltzan and Keely Cashman and AJ Hurt.",

The 26-year-old has won two of his three starts early in the PGA Tour season and has risen to the top five in the official world golf rankings.\n\nBut PGA Tour veterans Tommy Fleetwood and Tony Finau have chosen two different young tour rookies who they believe can be ‘special’ in the future.\n\nSix-time PGA Tour winner Finau has identified two talents on the PGA Tour who he thinks will be special, and Fleetwood agrees.\n\nAfter playing against them on TGL, he predicts a bright future for both Neal Shipley and Luke Clanton. When asked what advice he would give to them, Finau said, “I would just say keep doing what they’re doing.\n\n“They’ve gotten their careers off to a great start. The only thing they’re looking is the experience, but these young guys, what I’ve learned from a lot of these guys coming out of college, they’re not afraid of the spotlight. They’re not afraid to win. They’re not afraid to play well and be the star.\n\n“From what I’m seeing from Luke and Neal, I think they’re great kids. I can call them that because they’re younger than me. They’re in their 20s. But they’re great guys, and they have games to back it up.\n\n“I think they are both going to be special players on the PGA TOUR, and I don’t know that I would really share anything with them other than you guys, make sure you have good people around you to guide you down your path onward to success.”\n\nFleetwood added, “Yeah, I agree with Tony. I think the most important thing for those guys is to keep doing what they’re doing, and in no time, I think there’s just so many examples of — a lot of us have done it, but go searching for something that you feel like you want or lack in detriment to what you’ve already got. They’ve got so much.\n\n“You see them, it’s amazing watching them play golf. They’ve got such a great attitude and passion for the game. I think just always protect that. It’s great watching young players like that with the fire in them and how much they love it. As long as they protect that, they’ll be fine.”\n\nShipley was first thrust into the limelight when he played a round with Tiger Woods at Augusta National as an amateur. He impressed at his first Masters, making the cut and finishing T53, but it’s not been the start to his first full PGA Tour season that he’d have hoped.\n\nShipley missed the cut at his first three starts of the season, but the WM Phoenix Open saw a slight improvement in form. The popular American made the cut and finished T68 to claim his first paycheck of the season.\n\nClanton has had no such luck so far. He’s yet to make a cut, missing the weekend at the Sony Open and the Farmers Insurance Open, and he withdrew from the American Express.\n\nBoth need to improve their form if they want to retain their tour cards in 2027.",

    "description": "The Tennessee Titans’ decision to hire Robert Saleh as head coach looks better after Super Bowl LX",
    "fullText": "There was much debate over whether or not the Tennessee Titans should hire an offensive minded or defensive minded head coach. After interviewing nearly 20 candidates, it was announced the Titans were going with Robert Saleh on January 22nd. Roughly two weeks later, defensive coaches took center stage in Super Bowl LX.\n\nBoth the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots feature defensive-minded head coaches in Mike Macdonald and Mike Vrabel. It was Macdonald’s Seahawks who dominated, winning Super Bowl LX 29-13. And with that, the Titans’ decision to hire Saleh indicates they are moving in the right direction.\n\nThe NFL is a copycat league. Macdonald became the first defensive play-caller to win a Super Bowl. Naturally, Saleh has already announced his intention to call defensive plays for the Titans.\n\nThe Titans have an ascending franchise quarterback in Cam Ward. The thought behind hiring an offensive-minded coach was to prioritize his development. The Titans ultimately went with the best leader in Saleh, in an attempt to course-correct the Vrabel-Brian Callahan mistake.\n\nSaleh, like Macdonald and Vrabel, will be tasked with ensuring his team has the right offensive system in place to support the quarterback. Hiring Brian Daboll as OC was a home-run for Ward’s development. All defensive coaches encounter challenges here. Macdonald is about to lose his OC Klint Kubiak, forcing him to hire his third coordinator in as many seasons. Vrabel was fortunate to be saddled with Josh McDaniels.\n\nDefenses dominated Super Bowl LX. Both head coaches were of that variety. Their offensive coordinators are current/former head coaches in Kubiak and McDaniels. Saleh should have a similar set-up with Daboll on his staff.\n\nThe Titans fired Vrabel and also interviewed Macdonald before hiring Callahan. Those are tough truths to swallow. But as Tennessee moves forward under Mike Borgonzi, appointing Saleh should come with promising returns.",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich fans were dealt a shocking blow over the weekend when the name of club legend Franck Ribéry was one of hundreds of recognizable figures found within the infamous Epstein files.\n\nThe initial post on the matter is available here.\n\nIt should be noted that within the files, many of the names mentioned have not been formally accused of wrongdoing or charged with any crimes connected to Epstein, a financer and convicted sex offender. The release included over 2,000 videos and 180,000 images.\n\nAt this stage, the report is not considered to be an indictment or an acknowledgement of any wrong doing by those referenced within the files. What happens with all of this detail remains to be seen.\n\nHowever, Brusa Carlo Alberto, lawyer of Bayern legend Franck Ribéry, mounted a reactive attack to his client being named in the files.\n\n“This is fake news. I will take action in my capacity as Mr. Ribéry’s lawyer and implement all necessary legal proceedings to punish those responsible for this fake news, which is an attack on the dignity of my client and his family,” Alberto said (as capture by @iMiaSanMia).\n\nAs noted above, the files have some very damaging and descriptive information on many public figures. Ultimately, government officials and authorities might nor might decide to pursue action based on some of the information contained within the dossier.\n\nIf you are looking for more Bayern Munich and German national team coverage, check out the latest episodes of Bavarian Podcast Works, which you can get on Acast, Spotify, Apple, or any leading podcast distributor…\n\nNew, improved notifications system!\n\nComment on articles, community posts",

    "fullText": "Isaiah Stewart sprinting across the court to confront Miles Bridges during a heated Pistons-Hornets clash has sent NBA fans into meltdown.\n\nThe chaotic moment quickly overshadowed the game itself, with video clips spreading faster than officials could regain control.\n\nFootage shared by Legion Hoops captured the exact moment Isaiah Stewart broke into a full sprint toward Miles Bridges as tensions boiled over.\n\nThe incident unfolded during a dead ball after Bridges became involved in an altercation with Pistons big man Jalen Duren. As players converged, Stewart rushed in from a distance, escalating the confrontation within seconds.\n\nAccording to the official NBA report, Stewart, Bridges, Duren, and Charlotte’s Moussa Diabate were all ejected for fighting activity. The situation deteriorated so rapidly that officials had little choice but to clear multiple players from the floor.\n\nThe chaos did not stop there. Hornets head coach Charles Lee was also ejected later in the fourth quarter after aggressively approaching an official and needing to be restrained by his own player.\n\nFor Stewart, the moment reinforced a growing reputation. His willingness to jump into confrontations has become a defining part of his on-court identity, particularly in emotionally charged games.\n\nFan reaction online was immediate and polarising. Some drew dramatic historical comparisons, with one writing, “Malice the Palace 2.0,” referencing the league’s most infamous brawl.\n\nOthers focused on the league’s image. “This is not a good sight for the game,” one fan commented, echoing concerns about optics and discipline.\n\nNot everyone disapproved. Some embraced the chaos, with one post reading, “Isaiah Stewart will always be doing ts, and I love it.” That sentiment reflected a segment of fans who admire Stewart’s raw intensity.\n\nThere was also speculation about consequences. “Mr. Silver may make an example out of him,” one fan wrote, anticipating potential league discipline given Stewart’s history.\n\nAnother summed up the pattern bluntly. “I’ve never seen Isaiah Stewart’s video on the TL without a fight.” The comment captured how frequently Stewart finds himself at the center of viral confrontations.\n\nWith punches reportedly thrown and multiple ejections issued, the incident is now firmly on the NBA’s radar. Suspensions and fines remain possible as the league reviews the footage.\n\nWhy Seattle sports fans could have even more to celebrate after the Seahawks’ Super Bowl win\n\nKnicks star suggests five artists for next Super Bowl halftime show as Jalen Brunson reacts to Bad Bunny\n\nBad Bunny took a daring shot at LeBron James, the LA Lakers star must be outraged",

Denver won 49-27. The Seahawks don't have a scheduling conflict, so they will open the season at home.\n\nSeattle will also host the Los Angeles Rams and San Francisco 49ers in 2026, but those teams are set to face off in Australia, likely in Week 1, this season.\n\nSocial: Follow Broncos Wire on Facebook and Twitter/X! Did you know: These 25 celebrities are Broncos fans.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Broncos Wire: NFL: Seahawks play Broncos in 2026, but not in season opener",

    "fullText": "Daniel Cormier is taking it upon himself to address what he sees as a major issue by sharing his expertise with the next generation.\n\nThe UFC’s broad appeal comes from its diversity, bringing together fighters from every corner of the globe. While the sport used to be heavily dominated by Americans, that is no longer the case.\n\nWith the UFC White House event scheduled for 14 June, former light heavyweight and heavyweight champion Cormier has voiced concerns about where American MMA is heading.\n\nThe premier promotion will host its historic event, celebrating the history of America, on the White House lawn on June 14. However, one thing stands out: there are only two Americans holding championship belts – Kayla Harrison and Mackenzie Dern.\n\nJustin Gaethje recently captured the interim lightweight title, but he will need to beat Ilia Topuria before he can be recognised as the undisputed champion and carry that mantle for American men.\n\nAmerican MMA is currently facing a bleak period, which is particularly evident in its most historically popular weight class: heavyweight. The state of the heavyweight division within the promotion is currently a huge concern.\n\n“It’s not dead because Tom Aspinall is an absolute stud,” Cormier told Sports Illustrated.\n\n“I think Ciryl Gane proved that there’s a lot of competition in that weight class for him in that last fight. Jon Jones is still lingering… But the heavyweight division is always going to be OK because it doesn’t take much to get people excited.”\n\n‘DC’ went on to highlight what he sees as a more significant concern and explained how he intends to address it personally.\n\n“The bigger problem is the Americans because not only do we not have an American in the top 10 at heavyweight, we don’t have an American in the top 10 pound-for-pound in any weight.\n\n“Justin Gaethje now is the interim champion, it’s the only belt we have on American males. But we’ll fix that. We’ll start training some wrestlers,” Cormier stated.\n\nThe UFC commentator continues passing down his knowledge at Gilroy High School in California, working with young wrestlers looking to make their way up through grassroots wrestling.\n\nWhile Gaethje stands as the country’s most immediate hope, confidence is not high that he will be able to get the job done against Topuria.\n\nIn fact, some believe the next real hope for an American UFC champion might not even be on the roster yet.\n\nGable Steveson is already 2-0 in professional MMA and has made quite a splash at regional level. With Jon Jones serving as his coach, there is a belief that the 25-year-old could quickly rise through the ranks and emerge as America’s next big hope.\n\nMokaev, released by Dana White, handed UFC BJJ title shot offer\n\nJoaquin Buckley cooks Islam Makhachev and UFC welterweight division stars in brutal roast",

    "fullText": "College sports are in a strange spot right now, and college basketball has become the latest flashpoint as eligibility battles between players and the NCAA dominate the headlines.\n\nThe most notable case is Alabama center Charles Bediako, who joined the Crimson Tide halfway through the season after spending multiple years in the NBA G League. His status has become a week‑to‑week spectacle, with each court appearance drawing national attention.\n\nThe latest ruling deemed him ineligible for the remainder of the season. And if not for the earning potential tied to NIL, there’s a strong argument that Bediako never would have returned to college basketball at all — he likely would have pursued opportunities overseas instead.\n\nNo matter where you fall on the state of college athletics, it’s clear something has to change. The most logical starting point is a universal eligibility checklist for each sport. Right now, the system is a patchwork of one‑off lawsuits, international exceptions, and inconsistent rulings that make the entire process feel arbitrary.\n\nThe second major issue is the transfer environment. Before NIL, giving players more mobility and immediate eligibility made sense. Coaches could leave at any moment, and players deserved protection. But now, with the offseason functioning as a de facto free‑agency period, it’s understandable that universities want more control over their “investment.” As uncomfortable as that sounds, it’s already happening — schools have begun suing players who leave after signing NIL deals.\n\nWhat’s getting lost in all of this is the original purpose of these institutions. They are supposed to be places of higher education first, with athletics second. That’s why academic standards exist in the first place. Legendary Houston coach Kelvin Sampson captured the frustration perfectly when discussing the current landscape:\n\n\"...there is nothing educational about college basketball right now. It's all transactional.\"\n\nAnd he’s not wrong. Programs across the country — including Texas A&M, which has navigated its own roster churn and NIL‑driven decisions — are feeling the effects of a system that changes by the month.\n\nWhere college sports go from here is anyone’s guess. What we do know is that the money will keep flowing, the athletes will keep getting paid, and the NCAA will continue fighting for relevance in a world it no longer fully controls.\n\nYou can see Coach Sampson’s full comments below.\n\n“We're still in an educational institution, but there is nothing educational about college basketball right now. It's all transactional. And we all put our heads in the sand.\" \n\nKelvin Sampson on the state of college basketball \n\n(Via @ChrisYBaldwin 🎥)\n\n pic.twitter.com/o5TtywTam0\n\n— Hoop Herald (@TheHoopHerald) February 1, 2026\n\nContact/Follow us @AggiesWire on X and like our page on Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Texas A&M news, notes, and opinions.

    "fullText": "A little over a month ago, after the 2-1 home defeat to Nottingham Forest, West Ham were seven points from safety and staring a return to the Championship square in the face.\n\nThat night felt like the final nail, especially considering the manner of the defeat, where VAR disallowed a first-half goal from Crysencio Summerville that would've seen us go 2-0 up and then awarded a controversial 89th-minute penalty for Forest to snatch all three points.\n\nBut since then, West Ham have shown signs of life and fight with three wins from our last four Premier League outings, including a late win at Tottenham and a convincing home victory over Sunderland. The one defeat, against Chelsea, saw us leading 2-0 at half-time. The performances and the form have improved to the point where it would be dangerous to write us off just yet, given there's now just a three-point gap between us and 17th-placed Forest.\n\nThere are similarities to the 2006-2007 season. West Ham were 10 points from safety heading into a home game against Tottenham. Having lead 2-0 at half-time and then 3-2 with five minutes to go, Spurs scored two late goals to win 4-3. Fans were crying in the stands. Mark Noble was crying on the pitch. It felt over then.\n\nBut that defeat sparked a run of seven wins in our final nine league games, securing Premier League safety and a 15th-place finish. One of the two defeats in that run came against Chelsea, too.\n\nThere's more football to be played now compared to then, but there is real optimism that West Ham could pull off yet another great escape.\n\nWith Summerville's goal scoring form, Bowen's importance and Mateus Fernandes' midfield dynamism, anything is possible right now.\n\nWe go again tomorrow against Manchester United...\n\nFind more from James Jones at We Are West Ham",

    "fullText": "Greg Taylor is well into his first season away from Celtic, having made the switch to Greece.\n\nThe defender decided not to extend his contract at Celtic Park, despite Brendan Rodgers’ public efforts to keep him. Instead, he saw out his deal before heading abroad.\n\nKieran Tierney’s arrival helped explain the timing of Taylor’s departure. Still, as one of Celtic’s most regular starters, his absence was always going to be felt in some way.\n\nDuring his six years at the club, Taylor made over 200 appearances and picked up 11 trophies along the way. His most memorable period came under Ange Postecoglou.\n\nJonjoe Kenny, who spent a loan spell at Celtic, also joined the Greek side last summer after his time in Germany with Schalke and Hertha Berlin.\n\nPAOK also signed Giorgos Giakoumakis, a striker who was popular during his time at Celtic. He is currently on loan from Cruz Azul in Mexico.\n\nGiakoumakis also played under Postecoglou at Celtic and has now returned to Greece. Taylor mentioned how he played a part in helping PAOK sign the forward, having been asked by club officials for his opinion.\n\nTaylor told Open Goal: “It’s real Bobby Basic, isn’t it? Good morning, goodnights, hellos…\n\n“We’re lucky because the majority speak English unless you get a dodgy one at the petrol station.”\n\n“Jonjoe signed a week before me and then big Giako signed about a month after,” he continued.\n\n“I spoke to him and the sporting director was like: ‘What do you think of big Giako?’ I was like: ‘If you can get him, that’s a no-brainer.’”\n\nHe hasn’t featured as much as he might have hoped, but the defender has still managed to make 16 appearances for a team that’s active both domestically and in the Europa League.\n\nIn Italy, Nicolas Kuhn has struggled to break into the starting lineup at Como, making just five league starts and scoring once so far this season.\n\nOn the other hand, Alex Valle is enjoying his time under Cesc Fabregas at Como. His form has even led some to suggest he could earn a return to Barcelona in the future.\n\nAdam Idah hasn’t seen much playing time at Swansea either, though that’s largely due to Zan Vipotnik’s impressive run as the Championship’s leading scorer.\n\nSadio Mane heads up an Al Nassr squad that features stars like Cristiano Ronaldo and Aymeric Laporte. However, Frimpong isn’t alone among former Hoops teammates; others such as Odsonne Edouard (Al-Ittihad) and Giorgos Giakoumakis (PAOK) have also made significant moves since their Celtic days.\n\nMark Clattenburg gives his view on Celtic’s disallowed goal against Falkirk after fan reaction online\n\nJohn Barnes and Ian Wright shed new light on the Mark Viduka Celtic controversy\n\nRoy Keane questions Dermot Desmond’s handling of Brendan Rodgers exit at Celtic",

Fulham, 0.43. Spurs, 0.55.\n\nUnited kept clean sheets against City and Spurs, while Arsenal profited from a fortunate own-goal and a scrappy corner. Fulham netted through a penalty and Kevin's wonder strike.\n\nSteve Holland was always going to be a smart appointment as Carrick's Number two. Not only is he a lifelong United supporter, but he is a specialist in defensive set-up.\n\nYears of experience contributing towards the success of managers like Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Gareth Southgate in huge jobs is now showing at Old Trafford.\n\nCarrick deserves his mass praise, as do his other assistants Jonathan Woodgate, Travis Binnion and Jonny Evans.\n\nBut Holland and United is a match made in heaven, and he must stay on, regardless of who takes the helm next season.\n\nIt's another week, and now another test. West Ham has been a hopeless hunting ground for United in recent years.\n\nThe Hammers' recent resurgence - fuelled by Crysencio Summerville's five-match scoring streak, ever-dangerous captain Jarrod Bowen and in-form talents El Hadji Malick Diouf and Matheus Fernandes - poses a serious risk of more misery.\n\nBut United can visit the London Stadium with confidence that the attack can score goals and that the defence can keep them out.\n\nFind more from Alex Turk at Turk Talks FC",

The unit returned to playing up to traditional Giants standards, earning praise for its improved performance despite limited wins.\n\nBullen described serving as DC as a \"great honor and privilege,\" focusing on hard work and player development rather than external validation. His success drew widespread interest, including prior interview requests from the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals.\n\nUnder new Giants head coach John Harbaugh, Bullen was retained on staff -- amid a broader coaching purge -- but primarily as outside linebackers coach.\n\nTeams cannot block promotional interviews, positioning Bullen as a rising candidate for full-time coordinator opportunities.

    "fullText": "All the fight rumors you’ve heard regarding the big UFC White House card in June are pure lies! That’s according to UFC CEO Dana White, but things are about to change as the heads of the promotion gather in Las Vegas today to start matchmaking the America250 extravaganza.\n\nDetails on the June 15th card continue to trickle in. White has shared design drawings of what the custom light rig will look like, and has described some of the crazy expenses involved in staging a show like this. The company will pay out nearly a million dollars to replace the South Lawn following the show, and that’s chump change compared to some of the other costs.\n\nWhen it comes to the actual fights on the card, we’ve heard Donald Trump claim the event will feature all championship bouts. TKO head Ari Emanuel has said there will be ‘six or seven fights.’ As for who exactly will compete? Dana White says those choices begin today, which means the reports of Conor McGregor vs. Colby Covington are false.\n\nDana White says White House will have fights by the weekend. pic.twitter.com/8FbOVoj7TD\n\n— Oscar Willis (@oscarswillis) February 10, 2026\n\n“Total BS,” White wrote on an Instagram post claiming Covington vs. McGregor was booked. “White House matchmaking meeting is tomorrow. Mick Maynard flying in tomorrow for it. We will have fights dialed in by this weekend.”\n\nThat’s good, because the UFC seems to be keeping all their powder dry until they decide exactly who will fight at the White House. As it stands this morning (Feb. 10, 2026) not a single UFC champion (other than the BMF belt holder) is booked into a fight. We anticipated a bit of a logjam due to the black hole gravity of the White House, and here it is. The sooner UFC deals with it, the better.\n\nAs it stands, the most likely fight we see at the top of the White House card is Ilia Topuria vs. Justin Gaethje to unify the lightweight title. Conor McGregor is still a possibility, but given how much he costs and how much the UFC is giving up to do this event without a gate, we doubt the bean counters at TKO will let him compete. Jon Jones sounds like he’s given up on trying to convince UFC to book him again. And can Kayla Harrison really recover from neck surgery in time to face Amanda Nunes? We have our doubts.\n\nIt would be nice to imagine the UFC will start announcing White House fights as soon as decisions start getting made today. In reality, they have a conveyor belt approach to fight announcement which means we’ll probably have to wait until April’s UFC 327 in Miami gets its headliner bout revealed, and then UFC 328 in May.\n\nLet us know in the comments how you see the next couple of months shaking out matchmaking-wise!",

    "fullText": "Lawrence Stroll is betting on Adrian Newey to help turn Aston Martin into a championship-calibre team.\n\nAfter leaving Red Bull, Newey spent a period away from the paddock before making his return with Aston Martin in 2025. He came on board as managing technical partner, also taking an ownership stake in the team.\n\nLater that year, Eddie Jordan helped him work out his contract with the team. Then, toward the end of 2025, Lawrence Stroll surprised everyone by naming him team principal on top of his existing role.\n\nNewey’s track record includes big successes with Williams and McLaren. But while he’s known for being demanding and having strong results, his relationships within teams haven’t always been smooth.\n\nThe longest stable partnership came during Christian Horner’s time at Red Bull before Newey eventually left that project too. Now Mark Hughes has pointed out how Stroll is taking a similar approach to Horner’s when it comes to working with Newey.\n\nHughes spoke to Motor Sport Magazine about Newey’s move to Aston Martin and said: “So it’s a slightly different role now, but that team principal role does seem to be populated more and more by engineers, and Adrian Newey is the uber boss of everything at Aston Martin in terms of engineering.\n\n“He has long raged against any control over him, and it happened at Williams. It was part of his dissatisfaction there, and it happened at McLaren with Ron Dennis and Martin Whitmarsh.\n\n“He felt they had to control his excesses, and he felt they didn’t understand the big picture, and they were limiting what he was able to do.\n\n“And one of the reasons why Christian Horner harnessed him so successfully is that he just said so what do you want? What do you need?\n\n“Well, you can do it like that. You want to come in here? You want to live there? That’s fine.\n\nHughes added: “So he held on to him for much longer. Lawrence Stroll just seems to have given him the keys to the factory.”\n\nStroll has handed over more control than even Mercedes chief Toto Wolff has ever shown as he remains passionate about overseeing all aspects of their operations.\n\nJust because the car was out on track in Barcelona doesn’t mean Newey’s job is done. His reputation for cutting it close with deadlines suggests the car we see at the start of Bahrain testing could look quite different from what hits the track in Australia.\n\nDamon Hill believes Fernando Alonso’s experience will be vital during testing, with his sharp instincts helping Aston Martin get the most out of their new car.\n\nNewey has also been impressed with Lance Stroll, and together, their combined experience could be a real asset under the new regulations.\n\nWhile Newey holds significant influence over Aston Martin’s prospects, many factors still lie beyond his control. This includes potential issues with partners like Honda and Aramco, which could impact hopes of securing a championship with a fourth different team.\n\nOscar Piastri expected to leave McLaren in 2027 unless Andrea Stella makes key change\n\nLewis Hamilton says Bad Bunny’s Super Bowl halftime show was ‘one of the most important’ in history\n\nZak Brown says Red Bull surprised him at Barcelona F1 2026 shakedown test",

    "fullText": "Every NFL franchise dreams of reaching the Super Bowl, but for some teams the road to football’s biggest stage has been paved with more heartbreak than triumph. The list of most Super Bowl losses highlights organizations that have repeatedly come close to the ultimate prize only to fall short on the grandest stage. While losses can be tough for fans to swallow, they also reflect sustained excellence — getting to the championship game is itself a rare and remarkable achievement that only a handful of teams enjoy. From perennial contenders to decades-long underdogs, these franchises have forged identities around both drama and resilience.\n\nThe Patriots’ six Super Bowl losses are almost paradoxical when paired with their dynasty status. They reached the Super Bowl so often that disappointment became the price of sustained dominance. Several of those losses were razor-thin, last-minute heartbreaks that still sting New England fans. Ultimately, the volume of losses reflects just how frequently the Patriots lived on the NFL’s biggest stage.\n\nDenver’s Super Bowl losses include some of the most lopsided defeats in big-game history, which made them especially painful. For years, those blowouts defined the franchise more than its wins. Still, the Broncos kept returning, refusing to fade from relevance. Their later championships softened the scars, but those early losses remain unforgettable chapters.\n\nThe Bills’ four Super Bowl losses are unique — all came consecutively, an unmatched run of dominance and disappointment. That early-1990s team was powerful enough to rule the AFC but just couldn’t finish the job. Despite the heartbreak, Buffalo’s fanbase takes pride in that era’s consistency and grit. Those losses became part of the franchise’s identity rather than its undoing.\n\nMinnesota’s four Super Bowl defeats came during an era when the Vikings were perennial contenders. The “Purple People Eaters” defense struck fear across the league, yet the Lombardi Trophy always slipped away. That legacy of being close—but not close enough—has followed the franchise for decades. For Vikings fans, Super Bowl loss is both history and heartbreak.\n\nThe 49ers are better known for perfection in Super Bowls than failure, which makes their three losses stand out. Each defeat came during transitional moments between dominant eras. Rather than defining the franchise, those losses highlighted how high the standard was in San Francisco. Even in defeat, the 49ers were almost always contenders.\n\nAll three of Cincinnati’s Super Bowl losses came against the same opponent, giving the defeats an almost cruel symmetry. The Bengals were competitive in each appearance, often falling just short late. Those losses reinforced the narrative of a franchise knocking on the door but unable to break through. Recent success has reignited belief that history doesn’t have to repeat itself.\n\nPhiladelphia’s Super Bowl losses were emotional, hard-fought games that mirrored the city’s blue-collar identity. Each defeat deepened the hunger of one of the NFL’s most passionate fanbases. Those losses made eventual victory feel earned rather than inevitable. They’re reminders of how long the climb was before reaching the summit.\n\nThe Rams’ Super Bowl losses span multiple cities and eras, reflecting a franchise constantly reinventing itself. Some defeats were defensive struggles, others offensive collapses, but all were defining moments. Each loss forced organizational change and evolution. That adaptability eventually helped lead them back to championship success.\n\nMiami’s Super Bowl losses are often overshadowed by their perfect season and early dominance. Still, those defeats show how even elite teams aren’t immune to regression and disappointment. The Dolphins experienced both sides of football immortality within a short span. Their losses serve as a reminder that dynasties are fragile.\n\nDallas’ three Super Bowl losses sit quietly behind a louder legacy of championships. Each defeat came during eras of immense expectation and national spotlight. The losses didn’t diminish the brand, but they did humanize it. For “America’s Team,” even defeat became part of the mythology.\n\nThe Chiefs’ Super Bowl losses represent the bridge between old heartbreak and modern dominance. Before their recent success, Kansas City spent decades chasing relevance on the biggest stage. Those losses made the later championships feel transformational rather than routine. They’re proof that patience can eventually pay off in spectacular fashion.\n\nLooking across the history of the Super Bowl, patterns of near-misses and redemption emerge just as vividly as the glory of victory. The teams with the most losses have all carved out unique narratives — some marked by eras of dominance that ended in narrow defeat, others by periods of heartbreak that galvanized their fanbases. Yet for every loss on this list, there are lessons learned, legacies built, and the promise of future triumphs still to come. In the end, what matters as much as the losses are the stories of perseverance and passion that define these franchises and their supporters.\n\nThe post Teams with most losses in the Super Bowl appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Large proportion worked at Columbia University, which had its grants cut and frozen by the administration of US President Donald Trump.",
    "fullText": "France announced late last week that it would be awarding funds to 46 scientists as part of a high-profile initiative to recruit foreign researchers to the country with the promise of greater academic freedom. Almost all of them were previously at US institutions.\n\nThe more than €30-million Choose France for Science initiative, launched last April, is just one of a slew of European initiatives that aim to bring in research talent disaffected by changes elsewhere. These include the European Union's Choose Europe initiative, which is currently supported by nearly €900 million (US$1.1 billion) in research funding. The French programme will see 41 of the 46 recruits relocate to France from the United States. Eight of these researchers worked at Columbia University in New York City, which last year saw hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of its research grants cut and frozen by the administration of US President Donald Trump.\n\nThe awardees include Zhongkai Tao, a mathematician studying the structures of waves and matter in physics. Previously at the University of California, Berkeley, Tao has now taken up his grant at the Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies (Institut des Hautes Études Scientifiques or IHES) in Paris. Astrophysicist Kartik Sheth, who was associate chief scientist at NASA until he was fired by the agency during mass layoffs last year, has also been funded by the initiative. He will take up a three-year position at Aix-Marseille University in France.\n\nUnder Trump’s second presidency, US researchers have experienced grant cuts, the dismantling of science-funding agencies and increased federal control over universities. US foreign aid and awards to international collaborators have also been terminated. When announcing the call last year, Élisabeth Borne, then French minister for higher education and research, said that France would offer a “refuge” to researchers as “science and research face unprecedented threats worldwide”.\n\nThe high proportion of US scientists among those recruited by the programme shows that “enthusiasm and morale for doing science is low” in the United States, says Sharon Milgram, who led early-career researcher training and education programmes at the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) for nearly 20 years, until she retired in December.\n\nYet a few dozen vacating scientists are unlikely to make a large dent at US academic institutions, which altogether have more than 1.5 million faculty members, she says. France and other countries hoping to lure US scientists face an uphill battle: funders such as the NIH, with their multibillion-dollar budgets, are irreplaceable, Milgram adds. Tens of thousands of scientists, rather than dozens, would need to relocate for it to have a big long-term impact on US science, she says.\n\nColumbia University, which had most of its grants reinstated and unfrozen after the institution agreed to pay US$200 million to settle claims that it had failed to combat campus antisemitism, did not respond to Nature’s queries about its researchers leaving the institution.\n\nOf the 46 awardees, 19 are US nationals, 13 are French and 8 are originally from other European nations. The largest share are researchers studying climate, biodiversity and sustainable societies, according to the French Ministry of Higher Education and Research. The ministry declined to identify the 46 awardees, citing safety reasons.\n\nBut it did reveal that almost half of the awardees are headed to higher-education institutions in and around Paris. And 12 are going to Aix-Marseille University, which launched its own ‘Safe Place for Science’ initiative, worth about €15 million (US$17.9 million). The university said that the programme was launched “in a context where some scientists in the United States may feel threatened or hindered in their research”.\n\nAmong them is Alka Patel, a historian of art and architecture, previously at the University of California Irvine.\n\nMeanwhile, Tao says he decided to move to France because the IHES is “a world-leading institute of mathematics” and he will be surrounded in Paris by a strong maths community. “Certainly, the Choose France funding shows that the French government supports researchers from all over the world,” he adds. With the funding, Tao says that he will establish a research group and study uncertainty principles and geometric spectral theory.\n\ndoi: https://doi.org/10.1038/d41586-026-00405-2\n\nEpstein files reveal deeper ties to scientists than previously known\n\nUS grant applications surge at prestigious European research agency\n\nIs UK science in jeopardy?

    "fullText": "The trade deadline was Thursday, February 5th, and many players made the move to new destinations. Certain teams tried to solidify their rosters for the playoffs, while others did complete teardowns in return for future draft assets. With the trade deadline in the rearview window, the league has three days of games before the 2026 All-Star break from February 13 to February 19.\n\nUpon returning to game action, the playoff hunt will be in full force. Here are the NBA team power rankings heading into Week 17.\n\nSacramento needs to get younger. The Kings’ starting rotation does not include any young superstars, and the bench lacks high-upside depth. The team fails to post high outputs on offense and lacks the ability to prevent opponents from scoring.\n\nMORE: Former NBA champion Anthony Davis dealt in blockbuster trade\n\nNew Orleans is near the bottom in points per game and almost dead last in points allowed per game. The front office’s moves haven’t worked since Zion Williamson was drafted in 2019. The organization must find a way to offload Williamson, Dejounte Murray, and any other veteran players to acquire future draft picks.\n\nThe Pacers have had the brutal season that was expected. The team lost their court general, Tyrese Haliburton, during last year’s NBA Finals, and it’s clear the team has no plans to rush him back this season. During Thursday’s trade deadline, the front office acquired veteran center Ivica Zubac for unrestricted free agent Bennedict Mathurin and two first-round picks. This move sets Indiana up for next season and beyond.\n\nWashington is one of the league’s worst in offense and defense. The team made another big splash last Thursday, acquiring Anthony Davis from Dallas. Once healthy, the Wizards’ starting lineup will feature Trae Young and Anthony Davis.\n\nThe Nets are dead last in points per game, and one of their best scorers, Cam Thomas, has missed more than half of the team’s games due to injury. Now is the time to add draft capital as the team has two first-round picks in 2027, 2028, and 2029. Brooklyn must hit on upcoming draft picks.\n\nAs of last Monday, Utah looked poised to trade forward Lauri Markkanen. The Jazz went another direction, acquiring Jaren Jackson Jr. on Tuesday. Jackson Jr. immediately bolsters the roster heading into next season.\n\nLast season’s deal that sent Luka Doncic to Los Angeles looks worse after last week. On Wednesday, Dallas sent Anthony Davis to Washington for a return of players, including Khris Middleton, two first-round picks, and three second-round picks. Between the trades of Doncic and Davis, the Mavericks did not receive a young player with high upside.\n\nMemphis traded Jaren Jackson Jr. last Tuesday, and shipping Ja Morant in an offseason trade will set the franchise in full rebuild mode. The Grizzlies have taken a 180 following last season’s dismissal of head coach Taylor Jenkins. Jenkins led the team to three consecutive playoff appearances from 2020 to 2022.\n\nThe weeks leading up to last Thursday’s trade deadline were headlined by Milwaukee potentially trading Giannis Antetokounmpo. The team fielded calls but decided no offers were good enough. The front office needs offseason upgrades, but the team’s superstar may force his way out this summer.\n\nChicago underwent a full teardown by the trade deadline. However, the team did not receive a single first-round pick in any trade. The Bulls will use their salary cap in the upcoming offseasons while packaging a plethora of second-round picks in future trades.\n\nCharlotte’s front office saw that the team was near the playoffs and added at the trade deadline. The team acquired Coby White from Chicago and Tyus Jones from Orlando. White and Jones add depth to the Hornets’ offense that ranks 11th in points per game.\n\nLos Angeles is in playoff contention and decided to move 36-year-old James Harden to Cleveland for point guard Darius Garland. Thursday’s deadline saw the team move veteran Ivica Zubac to Indiana for Bennedict Mathurin, Isaiah Jackson, and two first-round picks. The moves signaled the Clippers were unwilling to give Harden another big payday, and now is the time to rebuild the roster around younger players.\n\nThe Trail Blazers have struggled over the past two weeks but are contending for the play-in tournament. The front office didn’t make a move at the trade deadline, holding onto future draft picks. If Portland can improve defensively, they can reach the playoffs following the play-in tournament.\n\nAtlanta acquired offensive pieces after trading Kristaps Porzingis to Golden State for Jonathan Kuminga and Buddy Hield. The additions of Kuminga and Hield upgrade the team’s depth. The Hawks are in contention to make it out of the Eastern Conference play-in tournament.\n\nOrlando’s main objective as the season continues is to have its roster healthy for the play-in tournament. The talent is there, and the Magic will be a tough matchup in the postseason. The team can make a push for the final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.\n\nOffensively, Miami ranks in the top five in points per game and will compete with any opposing team. The Heat’s issues start on defense. The team ranks near the bottom of the league in points allowed per game.\n\nGolden State moved disgruntled forward Jonathan Kuminga and guard Buddy Hield for center Kristaps Porzingis. They were unable to achieve the rumored deal to land Giannis Antetokounmpo from Milwaukee. The Warriors will continue feeling the loss of Jimmy Butler and will be lucky to get past the first round of the playoffs should they survive the play-in tournament.\n\nThe Raptors continue to march in the right direction. Their offense isn’t among the league’s best, but they haven’t dealt with serious injuries, and the defense ranks in the top 10. Improvements to the offense will lead Toronto to success as the season finishes out.\n\nThe 76ers didn’t make any splashes at the trade deadline but moved Jared McCain to the Thunder for a 2026 first-round pick and three second-round picks. Philadelphia is currently sitting in a playoff spot and needs a strong finish to the season. The team’s lack of depth may be their downfall in the playoffs.\n\nPhoenix has had a strong season and is hovering between a spot in the playoffs and the play-in tournament. The Suns’ defense has been a strong suit this season. Entering the playoffs healthy makes Phoenix a tough matchup for any opposing team.\n\nLos Angeles continues to battle Phoenix for a solidified spot in the playoffs or a trip to the play-in tournament. Defensive lapses have caused the Lakers issues this season, but the team continues to rebound. This may be LeBron James’s last shot at another title.\n\nThe Timberwolves added a depth piece when they acquired Ayo Dosunmu from the Bulls. Dosunmu gives the team versatility as a ball handler or shooting guard. Minnesota is ready to spring into the postseason.\n\nSince the end of December, Cleveland has gone on a run. The Cavaliers have moved up the Eastern Conference standings and are resembling the strong team they had last season. Ahead of last week’s trade deadline, the team acquired James Harden in exchange for Darius Garland. Harden gives the team a reliable option on offense.\n\nThe Rockets continue their consistent play and are one of the league’s best defensive teams. The team didn’t make any trade deadline deals and feels content with the current state of the roster. Houston can be a contender for the Western Conference Finals if Kevin Durant is healthy.\n\nDenver is one of the three best teams in the Western Conference. Nikola Jokic missed time a month ago, but Jamal Murray picked up the slack as he’s having the best season of his career and earned his first All-Star selection. A healthy Denver team, led by Nikola Jokic, can beat anyone in the playoffs.\n\nBoston continues to be one of the Eastern Conference’s top teams after many expected the team to struggle following Jayson Tatum’s injury in last season’s playoffs. Needing an upgrade at center, the Celtics acquired Nikola Vucevic from the Bulls. Boston has the talent to reach the Eastern Conference Finals.\n\nOne of the league’s best on offense and defense, New York is ready to chase Detroit for the top spot in the Eastern Conference. The Knicks were close to reaching the NBA Finals last season and have unfinished business. If New York and Detroit face off in the conference finals, the Knicks’ experience may give them the edge in the series.\n\nSan Antonio has been near the top of the Western Conference throughout the season. Victor Wembanyama has stayed healthy and is leading the team. Wembanyama’s previous seasons have ended following the All-Star Break. If the Spurs want to be serious title contenders, they must do everything in their power to keep Victor Wembanyama on the court.\n\nDetroit has sat atop the Eastern Conference for most of the season. The team has produced a top 10 offense and a top 3 defense. The front office added a much-needed three-point shooter, acquiring Kevin Huerter from the Bulls.\n\nOklahoma City has been the favorite to win the championship throughout the season. They lead the league in points scored and points allowed per game. The front office added a high-upside depth piece when they acquired Jared McCain from Philadelphia at the trade deadline.\n\nNFL: Ranking the greatest Super Bowl quarterback performances\n\nOLYMPICS: Mikaela Shiffrin has 4-word message for Snoop Dogg two days before Winter Games\n\nSPORTS MEDIA: 9 MLB teams abandoning FanDuel Sports Network immediately\n\nENTERTAINMENT: Police deny viral claim about suspect in disappearance of Savannah Guthrie’s missing mother\nVIRAL: WWE Hall of Famer Nikki Bella clears air on Cooper DeJean dating rumors\n\nThe post NBA Power Rankings ahead of 2026 All-Star Break appeared first on The Big Lead.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nIt's only been two games, but James Harden has twice proven already how important he can be for the Cleveland Cavaliers.\n\nThe Cavs needed some late magic to rally past the Denver Nuggets on Monday night. Harden provided it, drilling a stepback 3-pointer to tie the game at 117-apiece before two Donovan Mitchell free throws won it.\n\nHarden scored six points and dished out four assists in the fourth quarter to get off to a 2-0 start with the Cavaliers.\n\nHe finished the game with 22 points, 10 rebounds, seven assists and three blocks.\n\nMORE: These highlight of 12-year old LeBron James are spectacular\n\nClearly, Harden adds a different dimension.

    "description": "The UFC president said the fight card for this June’s unprecedented event will be ‘dialed in by this weekend’",
    "fullText": "Dana White has moved to dismiss a rumoured fight between Conor McGregor and Colby Covington as “total BS”, after it was claimed the contest could headline the UFC’s White House event this summer.\n\nThe UFC is working on an unprecedented fight card, currently scheduled to take place on the South Lawn on 14 June, and there has been much speculation over the match-ups that will feature.\n\nUS president Donald Trump, a close friend of UFC chief White, claimed in December that there would be “eight or nine championship fights, the biggest fights they’ve ever had”, and that “every one’s a championship fight”. But last week, Ari Emanuel – CEO of the UFC’s ownership group, TKO – suggested that “six to seven” fights is a more realistic prospect.\n\nEither way, McGregor vs Covington will not be one of them, according to UFC president White.\n\nOn Monday, the Instagram account @menacemmahq posted a mock-up image of former champion McGregor and American star Covington, with the fighters facing off in front of the White House. The caption read: “Not confirmed yet by the UFC but it is highly possible that the main event for the UFC White House card is going to be Conor McGregor vs Colby Covington.\n\n“This fight has been rumored the last few weeks after Dana said Conor will not be fighting vs Michael Chandler. Both fighters have been drug tested this year and in fact McGregor has been tested 2 times this year already.\n\n“The press conference for this fight would be insane. The smack talk would be hilarious. If this fight happens, who do you think wins?”\n\nHowever, White was quick to enter the comment section under the post, writing: “Total BS.......\n\n“White House matchmaking meeting is tomorrow. [UFC matchmaker] Mick Maynard flying in tomorrow for it.\n\n“We will have fights dialed in by this weekend.”\n\nMr Trump claimed in December, “[White] is actually holding back fights right now, for six months, so he can do it for [14] June,” and although there is no definitive evidence of this, the notion might be backed up by the UFC’s public schedule.\n\nNo champions are due to defend their titles at any upcoming events, with the exception of Max Holloway, who will put the “Baddest Motherf*****” belt on the line against Charles Oliveira on 7 March. However, that is not a regular, divisional title.\n\nFurthermore, only two title fights to have taken place so far in 2026: an interim title bout at lightweight, between Paddy Pimblett and the victorious Justin Gaethje; and Alexander Volkanovski’s successful featherweight defence against Diego Lopes. A women’s bantamweight title fight was scheduled in January, but champion Kayla Harrison suffered an injury that derailed that bout with Amanda Nunes.\n\nMcGregor and Jon Jones are among the high-profile fighters to have called for a spot on the White House card, but White has been coy on the involvement of both. The UFC president suggested he might not be able to trust Jones, who has a history of legal issues and failed drug tests, while he was non-committal on McGregor featuring.\n\nMcGregor is a former dual-weight UFC champion – the first in the promotion’s history – but has not fought since 2021, when he suffered a broken leg. The Irishman, 37, was due to return against Chandler in 2024 but withdrew from the bout on two weeks’ notice, citing a broken toe.\n\nOver the last decade, McGregor has faced numerous legal issues and has rarely competed, fighting in the UFC just four times since late 2016 and going 1-3. He also boxed once, losing to Floyd Mayweather in 2018.\n\nMeanwhile, Covington is a former interim UFC welterweight champion, but his form has dipped in recent years, with the 37-year-old going 2-4 since late 2019.\n\nThe American’s last bout was a stoppage loss to Joaquin Buckley in December 2024, while McGregor’s most-recent fight saw him lose to old rival Dustin Poirier for the second time in a row.\n\nWhile the fight card for the UFC’s White House event is up in the air, other details have emerged, with TKO boss Emanuel saying last week: “I think it’s 3,000-4,000 [attendees], and then there will be other areas [to watch the fights]. It’s gonna be CBS, Paramount+. I mean, I don’t know who is not watching that fight [card].”\n\nMr Trump had previously said: “I think the arena’s gonna be 5,000 or 6,000 seats, right in front of the front door of the White House, and 100,000 people in the back, where they’re putting up eight or 10 very big screens.”",

    "description": "A hands-on tutorial on using the image generator plugin in Claude Code. Learn how to generate images from text prompts, edit existing photos, create blog covers, product mockups, logos, and more - all from your terminal.",
    "fullText": "I published this tweet a few days ago on using my Claude Code image generator plugin with the new Claude Code Playground plugin to improve image generations. The tweet blew up and there was a lot of interest in the process, so I am sharing a bit on how I achieved it.\n\nClaude Code can generate and edit images directly from your terminal using the image generator plugin. It can do this in an agentic loop so it can self-improve images given a criteria or set of instructions.\n\nI refer to this process as Agentic Image Generation. In this tutorial, we'll walk through a simple example of what you can do with it - from simple text-to-image generation to editing existing photos and creating professional assets for your projects.\n\nAnother powerful plugin you can combine in with is the new Claude Code Playground plugin which takes image generation to another level.\n\nThe image generator plugin is part of the DAIR.AI Academy Plugins marketplace.\n\nStep 1: Add the marketplace to Claude Code:\n\nStep 2: Install the image generator plugin:\n\nYou can also install it from the Marketplace in Claude Code by typing in /plugin and then adding dair-ai/dair-academy-plugins as a marketplace and then installing the image-generator plugin from the set of plugins.\n\nStep 3: Get a free Gemini API key from Google AI Studio and add it to your shell profile (~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):\n\nThen restart your terminal or run source ~/.zshrc.\n\nThat's it! The plugin is ready to use.\n\nUnder the hood, the plugin uses Google's Nano Banana Pro model (gemini-3-pro-image-preview) for image generation. It supports text-to-image, image editing, multi-image composition, and outputs up to 4K resolution.\n\nNote that this is a first version of this plugin and there is more improvements to come. But it should simplify the process of generating images in Claude Code.\n\nNew to Claude Code? Our course covers everything from setup to building full AI-powered apps — including how to use plugins like this one.\n\nLet's walk through a real example. Say you want to create a professional infographic summarizing Anthropic's Building Effective Agents blog post. Here's what you type into Claude Code:\n\nClaude Code reads the blog post, extracts the key concepts, and generates a clean infographic, all in one step.\n\nHere's the infographic it generated:\n\nThat's it. One prompt. Claude Code fetches the article, understands the content, crafts a detailed image generation prompt, calls the Gemini API, and saves the result. No manual steps, no copying text, no switching between tools. And you can ask Claude Code to access each generated image, and improve on each iteration in a self-improving loop. You can easily achieve this by providing adequate instructions to Claude Code. I will be writing a separate blog post on that soon.\n\nKeep in mind that I didn't try hard to get a phenomenal image or anything like that. You could do that easily by investing more time in the initial prompt. I just wanted to keep it simple to focus the tutorial on the overall process of agentic image generation, which can be applied and leveraged in really interesting ways.\n\nBut if you are a beginner, you describe what you want at a high level and the agent handles the entire workflow: reading sources, deciding on layout, choosing colors, and producing the final image.\n\nPlugins become even more powerful when you combine them. Say you've generated an infographic and now want to annotate it (highlight sections, add labels, or mark areas for revision). Instead of opening a separate tool, you can use the Playground plugin to build an interactive annotation interface right from Claude Code.\n\nThe Playground plugin creates self-contained HTML tools with interactive controls and live previews. You can ask Claude Code to generate an image annotation playground that lets you visually mark up any image:\n\nThe result is a single HTML file you can open in your browser. Here's what the annotation tool looks like in action. We're using it to review and improve the infographic we just generated:\n\nOn the left you have the infographic with numbered annotation markers. On the right, an annotations panel where you can add feedback for each section. Note the annotated improvements like \"make these bubbles a nice light green\" or \"can we make the icons nicer\". At the bottom, there's a prompt output that compiles all your annotations into a single ready-to-use prompt.\n\nOnce you're done annotating, hit copy on the generated prompt and paste it straight back into Claude Code:\n\nThe playground compiled our three annotations into a structured revision prompt:\n\nNo manual prompt writing needed. Claude takes the feedback, calls the image generator again, and produces an improved version of the infographic:\n\nThe light green bubbles, colorful workflow pattern sections, and cleaner icons - all applied from the annotations we made in the playground.\n\nThis is the full agentic loop: generate → annotate → refine. The image generator creates the visual, the playground plugin builds the review tool, you add your feedback visually, and then feed that back to the agent for the next iteration. The entire cycle happens without leaving your terminal and browser.\n\nThe same pattern works for any kind of visual. Here are a few ideas:\n\nYou can also combine multiple images, specify aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 3:2), choose resolutions (1K, 2K, 4K), and iterate on results by asking Claude to adjust colors, composition, or style.\n\nTry it out. Start with an infographic or a blog cover and experiment from there.\n\nIf you are interested, we will be doing a live walkthough of this process for our Pro subscribers this Friday.\n\nWant to learn more about building with AI?

    "description": "Tired of AI’s high costs and limits? Discover how a home server and graph theory outperformed GPT-5.2 for deep research, saving $550/month while owning your ...",
    "fullText": "I recently had a problem that could be solved with money, which is the worst kind of problem.\n\nI am building a new venture called eh-trade.ca. To make it work, I needed deep financial research on 11,000 different stocks.\n\nThe \"Enterprise\" solution is to buy an API subscription. I looked into this. For my usage, the pricing is somewhere between \"$200/month\" and \"Contact Sales\". If you are a micro-preneur like me, \"Contact Sales\" means \"You cannot afford this.\"\n\nThe \"AI\" solution is to ask an LLM to research each stock, which works really well. But 11,000 requests at $0.05 per research session is still $550. Plus, I don't like renting intelligence. I prefer to own it.\n\nSo I decided to use the hardware I already had: a home server with four RTX 3090s. It’s a 96GB VRAM beast that heats my basement and scares my birds.\n\nThere was just one problem. The models I can run locally (like qwen3 or phi4) have small context windows. Yes, on the model card they theoretically support 40k+ of context, but they would run very slowly on my hardware, so really, it's 4K -- enough for a few screenfuls of text. Moreover, even if I enabled the long contexts, the models struggle to reason over them. If you try to feed them ten search results about a company's balance sheet, the 'needle in the haystack' effect kicks in. They'll get confused and start hallucinating dividends that don't exist.\n\nMost \"AI Agents\" are built on a simple loop, often called ReAct (Reason + Act). It looks like this:\n\nThe problem is the Context Window. By step 3, your prompt looks like a Walmart receipt. By step 5, you have exceeded 8,000 tokens, and the model forgets what it was doing and starts making stuff up.\n\nSure, it works fine if you are OpenAI and have infinite GPUs. It does not work if you are running on a consumer card in a closet.\n\nA few months ago, I read a paper called GraphReader. It proposed a different way to think about long contexts. Instead of dumping everything into a chat log, why not treat information as a graph?\n\nThe core insight is that you don't need to remember everything. You only need to remember the Atomic Facts.\n\nAn Atomic Fact is a single, indivisible truth.\n\nIf we extract these facts and throw away the rest, we can compress megabytes of web pages into a few kilobytes of JSON.\n\nI built a library called laconic to implement this. I wrote it in Go, because the rest of my projects are all in Go. Plus, my python environments always end up as a tangled mess of pip install errors.\n\nLaconic doesn't keep a chat history. It keeps a Notebook. The context window size is O(N), where N is the number of facts, not the number of words.\n\nLaconic uses a specific strategy called graph-reader.\n\nThe beautiful part? The LLM never sees the full history. It only sees the current Notebook and the current search result. This means I can run complex, multi-step research tasks on a model with a tiny 4k context window, and it never forgets a thing.\n\nHere is the code to run a research agent on my home server using Ollama:\n\nTo really test if this strategy works on constrained hardware, I ran a research question using qwen3:4b—a tiny 4-billion-parameter model.\n\nWithout the agentic loop, the model cannot answer this question. If you ask it directly, it responds that \"the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has not been announced.\"\n\nHowever, with the agent, it autonomously searches, extracts atomic facts, and synthesizes this:\n\nAnswer: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry was awarded to David Baker (University of Washington, Howard Hughes Medical Institute), Demis Hassabis, and John M. Jumper (Google DeepMind). David Baker was recognized for computational protein design. Demis Hassabis and John Jumper were awarded for protein structure prediction using AlphaFold2.\n\nThe agent found all three laureates, their exact affiliations, and their distinct contributions — information entirely outside the model's training data — by exploring multiple search queries and accumulating verified facts in a structured notebook.\n\nIf you hang out in the parts of the internet where people try to make AI write code without hallucinating, you might have heard of the Ralph Loop.\n\nPopularized by Geoffrey Huntley, the Ralph Loop (often named after Ralph Wiggum) is a brute-force solution to the context problem. You write a bash script that:\n\nThen it starts over. Fresh context. Zero memory leak. The \"memory\" is the file system.\n\nLaconic is essentially a Ralph Loop for reading.\n\nInstead of a bash script, it's a Go loop. Instead of git commit, we update a JSON Notebook. But the philosophy is identical: The Context Window is a liability.\n\nMost frameworks try to manage the context window like a precious resource. Ralph and Laconic treat it like a disposable napkin. Use it once, wipe the slate clean, and grab a fresh one.\n\nIt turns out that if you treat an LLM like a goldfish with a notepad, it becomes significantly smarter.\n\nI am currently running this loop on 11,000 tickers that I'm missing basic information on. It will take a week, and cost some power, but I would have left the machine on anyway because I am running a few other things on it.\n\nAnd if you want to find stocks that are going up, keep an eye on eh-trade.ca. My customers tell me I should brag more, so I'm up 280% in seven months following momentum strategies that it's showing on the main page.\n\nI'll have the data soon, assuming my basement doesn't catch fire.",

    "fullText": "Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has condemned anti-Olympics protesters as “enemies of Italy and Italians” after violence on the fringes of rallies in Milan and the alleged sabotage of train infrastructure.\n\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) also joined the criticism on Sunday, condemning violence linked to the protests in Milan on Saturday, stating such behaviour has no place at the Games.\n\nThe incidents ⁠happened on the first full day of competition in the Winter Games that Milan is hosting along with the Alpine town of Cortina d’Ampezzo.\n\nMeloni praised thousands of Italians who are working to keep the Games running smoothly, many of whom are volunteers.\n\n“Then there are those who are enemies of Italy and Italians. The protesters demonstrate ‘against the Olympics,’ causing these images to end up on televisions around the world. After others cut the railway cables to prevent the trains from leaving,” the prime minister wrote in a statement on Facebook on Sunday.\n\nThe Italian Transport Ministry said that an investigation into suspected “terrorism” had been launched after the railway sabotage near the city of Bologna on Saturday and that those responsible would face a multimillion-euro damages claim.\n\nThousands of people took to the streets in Milan on Saturday to protest against the Olympics’ environmental and social consequences, including concerns over excessive public spending and ecological damage.\n\nThe march, which began peacefully, turned tense when some protesters set off smoke bombs and firecrackers near Olympic venues. Milan police responded with tear gas and water cannons to disperse the crowds, leading to clashes in areas close to the Olympic Village and a nearby highway.\n\nInternational Olympic Committee spokesperson Mark Adams told reporters on Sunday that peaceful protest is legitimate, but “we draw a line at violence”, which “has no place at the Olympic Games”.\n\nSeparately, protesters have also rallied against Israel’s participation in the games and against US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, which has deployed agents to provide security to the US delegation at the Games.\n\nDuring Friday’s opening ceremony, Israel’s small delegation marched into Milan’s San Siro Stadium to a smattering of “boos” from the crowds. The four Israeli athletes, waving their national flag and smiling, saw the jeers quickly drowned out by the loud music and overall festive atmosphere.\n\nUnited States Vice President JD Vance and his wife, Second Lady Usha Vance, received a similar hostile reception when they appeared on the stadium’s big screen.",

    "description": "GUID / UUID v7 is a modern time-ordered identifier combining Unix millisecond timestamps with randomness. Learn about its structure, database performance benefits, advantages over v1 and v4, and when to use v7 for sortable distributed IDs.",
    "fullText": "GUID / UUID v7 was officially standardized in RFC 9562 in May 2024.\n\nV7 is a modern, actively recommended GUID / UUID version with no deprecation concerns. It was specifically designed to address the limitations of older versions by providing time-based sortability (like v6) without exposing MAC addresses, and by offering better database performance than pure random identifiers (like v4).\n\nFor non-time-ordered identifiers, consider v4 (random).\n\nBit layout: a GUID / UUID is 128 bits written in a canonical 36-character string format with 32 hexadecimal digits plus 4 hyphens (8-4-4-4-12). For v7, the first 48 bits contain a Unix Epoch timestamp in milliseconds, followed by reserved version and variant bits, and the remaining bits are used for uniqueness (typically random, but may include a counter).\n\nGeneration algorithm: the leading 48 bits encode the current Unix Epoch timestamp in milliseconds (big-endian). The remaining bits (after version and variant) are filled with random data or a combination of random data and a counter to ensure uniqueness within the same millisecond.\n\nunix_ts_ms (48 bits): the first 48 bits encode a Unix Epoch timestamp in milliseconds. This provides a range from the Unix Epoch (January 1, 1970) to approximately the year 10889, offering over 8900 years of timestamp space.\n\nver (4 bits): the version field is set to 0111 (7 in hex), identifying this as a v7 UUID.\n\nrand_a (12 bits): 12 random bits immediately following the version field.\n\nvar (2 bits): the variant bits are set to 10, indicating RFC 4122 compliance.\n\nrand_b (62 bits): 62 bits of randomness or a combination of counter and random bits. Some implementations use a portion of this field as a monotonic counter to ensure strict ordering within the same millisecond on the same node. The specific layout is implementation-defined.\n\nTry our GUID / UUID Inspector to decode and visualize the timestamp and bit-level structure of v7 GUIDs / UUIDs.\n\nGUID / UUID v7 uses the standard 8-4-4-4-12 canonical format with 32 hexadecimal digits separated by hyphens (36 characters total).\n\nPractical rule: in the canonical string, the version is encoded as the first hex digit of the third group. For v7 it is 7. The variant is indicated by the high bits of the fourth group (often rendered as 8-b in hex for the common standard variant). The first 12 hex digits encode the Unix Epoch timestamp in milliseconds.\n\nOrdering behavior: because the timestamp is stored at the front (big-endian), sorting v7 GUIDs / UUIDs in their standard byte/string form generally groups them by time. Within the same millisecond, order is influenced by the remaining bits (random and/or counter), so ordering is typically time-correlated, not perfectly sequential.\n\nRandomness: after the 48-bit timestamp and the version/variant fields, a GUID / UUID v7 has 74 bits of randomness (or counter + random bits).\nThis provides 2⁷⁴ possible combinations within the same millisecond.\nThat's approximately:\n\n1.9 × 10²² unique values per millisecond\n\nThe 48-bit timestamp in GUID / UUID v7 stores Unix Epoch milliseconds, which determines how far into the future v7 identifiers can be generated.\n\nFor practical purposes, the 48-bit timestamp provides over 8,900 years of usable range, making timestamp overflow a non-issue for any real-world application. By comparison, the 32-bit Unix timestamp (used in many legacy systems) overflows in January 2038, while v7's 48-bit millisecond timestamp won't overflow for nearly 9 millennia.\n\nGUID / UUID v7 is the recommended choice for modern applications requiring time-ordered identifiers with decentralized generation. It combines the best features of v6 (time-ordering) and v4 (privacy and simplicity), making it ideal for databases, event streams and distributed systems. Use v7 when time-correlation is helpful and prefer v4 when you need to avoid exposing creation time in the identifier.\n\nThese articles expand on related concepts, formats and practical considerations.\n\nLearn how to handle clock rollback in GUID / UUID v7 implementations. Covers RFC 9562 guidance, common scenarios like NTP sync and VM migrations, implementation strategies with code examples and best practices for maintaining monotonicity.\n\nGUID / UUID v6 is a reordered version of v1 with lexicographically sortable timestamps. Learn about its structure, advantages for database indexing, field compatibility with v1 and when to use v6 vs v7.\n\nComprehensive comparison of all GUID / UUID versions (v1-v8). Understand the differences, use cases, security implications and performance characteristics of each version to choose the right one for your project.\n\nGUID / UUID v8 is a flexible, application-defined identifier format providing a standardized container for custom schemes. Learn about its structure, use cases, when to use v8 for custom identifiers and why most applications should prefer v4 or v7.",

    "description": "The setup, featured on Russian state media, is supposed to spin steel cables that whack incoming FPV drones or at least keep their explosions at bay.",
    "fullText": "Russian troops are experimenting with a contraption that spins steel cables to protect vehicles from small loitering munitions.\n\nThe device was seen on the \"War Correspondents\" program of the Russian state TV channel Smotrim, which reported on Sunday that the gadget was built by mechanics from the 70th Motor Rifle Regiment in Zaporizhzhia.\n\nFitted to an uncrewed ground vehicle called a Courier, the defensive tool resembles a large weed whacker that's raised to spin vertically.\n\nThey're essentially discs with roughly nine or 10 thin cables that whip aside incoming objects. Each disc, turned via a shaft, sticks out from one of the Courier's four sides.\n\nThe Courier, a tracked, 550-pound Russian ground drone, is mounted with what appears to be a motor that can spin all four shafts simultaneously.\n\n\"When an FPV drone tries to strike, the cables either knock it down or deflect it to the side,\" said a man identified by state media as a squad leader named \"Struk.\" He described the spinner as a test device.\n\nThe Courier is a multi-purpose drone, meaning that it can potentially be used to transport cargo, retrieve the dead or wounded, or be fitted with weapons for assault missions.\n\nUncrewed ground vehicles have risen quickly as a new front of the war's technology race, with Russian and Ukrainian forces both hoping to scale up production of ground drones that can replace human soldiers for dangerous frontline tasks.\n\nLittle is known about the effectiveness of the new spinning device, but it's another example of how both sides of the war continue to innovate. In the conflict's early days, Russian troops fitted their battle tanks and armored vehicles with metal cages, nets, and spikes to increase survivability against small drone attacks.\n\nThe tactic was initially mocked, but has since spread even to militaries outside Ukraine and Russia.\n\nStill, the Courier is designed to carry a significant payload, so it has space for the new weed whacker — a luxury that battle tanks, armored vehicles, and weaponized drones don't enjoy.\n\nUkrainian bloggers reported in 2023 on a patent with a similar concept, though this idea involved a single, spinning fan mounted on the top of a battle tank to protect against munitions.\n\nIn May 2025, they posted images of another device that would protect vehicles in a similar fashion, with spinning blades on each side.\n\nA cited patent description said the system was designed with the belief that a drone operator would have difficulty seeing the spinning blades.",

    "title": "The guy who designed the iPhone helped craft the interior of Ferrari's first EV — and it's full of physical buttons and knobs",
    "description": "Ferrari typically designs its cars in-house. The automaker sought legendary iPhone designer Jony Ive's guidance for its first EV.",
    "fullText": "Jony Ive designed the iPhone, which famously ditched most of a phone's physical buttons for virtual ones. His take on the new Ferrari interior shows a very different approach.\n\nFerrari has spent five years working with LoveFrom, the design studio founded by Ive and fellow Apple design alum Marc Newson, to shape the interior of its first EV, the Luce.\n\nThe result is a button-heavy, screen-forward cabin that blends Ferrari's performance ethos with high-end, Apple-style minimalism.\n\nFerrari hasn't released photos of the exterior or a full list of specs, but earlier disclosures suggest the Luce will be a four-door, four-seat electric car capable of reaching 60 mph from a standing start in 2.5 seconds. It's expected to have a 330-mile range.\n\nThe Luce marks Ferrari's leap into electrification — with an interior wrapped in Ive's distinctive design language. Here's what the interior looks like.\n\nFerrari — long synonymous with grunting, high-performance racers — is moving into the near-silence of electric power.\n\nTo guide that transition, the automaker worked with LoveFrom to refine the interior's materials, shapes, and controls.\n\nThe result looks nothing like most EVs. The Luce's cabin is lined with tactile hardware — rows of machined-metal toggles and physical switches designed to be clicked, not swiped.\n\nFor any curious Apple fans, there are some familiar flourishes: brushed aluminum, slim leather surfaces, and a minimalist layout.\n\nThe slim, three-spoke steering wheel keeps things simple — starting with directional controls mounted directly on the wheel.\n\nMore buttons sit beneath the silver spokes, putting most core functions within thumb's reach.\n\nOn the left are controls for cruise, drive modes, and dash lighting. On the right are power modes, suspension settings, and wipers.\n\nVolume and track controls are tucked behind the wheel, while paddles manage torque delivery, mimicking the engagement of traditional gear changes. Even in an EV, Ferrari wants drivers to feel like they're choosing their own gears.\n\nThe center infotainment display looks a bit like an oversized Apple Watch. Ferrari's system comes complete with fan-speed settings, heated-seat controls, and a built-in circular clock.\n\nThe tablet-like screen sits on a ball-and-socket joint, allowing it to swivel toward either the driver or the passenger.\n\nFerrari also says the silver bar below the screen is a palm rest — perfect for drivers to stabilize their hand while switching Spotify playlists in a sharp corner.\n\nFerrari is leaning heavily into glass for the Luce's interior, using Corning Gorilla Glass across many hard surfaces — including the gear selector.\n\nThe company says the material is more crack-resistant than typical smartphone glass and is designed to withstand scratches from daily use.\n\nThere's also a touch of whimsy in the key fob. The square Ferrari badge is the key: slot it into the console, and the glass fob turns black, disappearing into the surrounding trim.\n\nPick it up and walk away, and it glows Ferrari's signature racing yellow.\n\nThe gauge cluster behind the steering wheel takes inspiration from helicopter cockpits.\n\nFerrari says the digital display is mounted directly to the steering column, keeping critical high-speed information locked in the driver's line of sight.\n\nThe setup is also a first for Ferrari.\n\nAt the center is a hybrid speedometer: a physical needle floating over layered digital driving data, all viewed through a curved lens. While most modern cars have abandoned analog needles entirely, Ferrari kept one — blending old-school driving cues with a fully digital display.\n\nFerrari first revealed its all-electric project in October 2025 under the working name \"Elettrica.\" Now, it has an official name: the Luce (pronounced LOO-che).\n\nIn Italian, luce translates to \"light.\"\n\nThe partnership between Ferrari and LoveFrom — first reported in 2021 — resulted in an interior designed to signal the automaker's ambition to reimagine the electric-car experience from the ground up.\n\nIt's an unusual move for Ferrari, which rarely brings in outside design firms.\n\n\"The team focused on perfecting and refining every solution to its purest form,\" the automaker said in a press release.\n\nThe rest of the car, which was developed in-house, will be revealed in May. Ferrari has not confirmed pricing or availability for the new EV yet.",

    "title": "Zillow just dealt a big blow to Compass — but it may be too little too late",
    "description": "The home-search giant can continue banning some real estate listings from its site, a judge ruled. Homebuyers still face a messy search process.",
    "fullText": "Search for a home on Compass.com, the website of America's largest real estate brokerage, and you'll find a familiar layout: a map of available homes, a bunch of price tags, a lineup of shimmering kitchens and golden-hour facades. It all looks a lot like Zillow, the near-ubiquitous home search site.\n\nThere is one key difference between Compass' site and Zillow, though: a prominently displayed black box.\n\nBehind the black box sits a heap of listings beyond Zillow's reach, so-called \"Private Exclusives\" that can only be seen with the help of a Compass agent. The intrigue is undeniable: \"Unlock 347 (8%) more homes you won't find anywhere else,\" the box urges when I search in the Austin area. In Los Angeles, there are apparently 366 homes that can only be unearthed by contacting Compass. New York City boasts nearly 450 homes you can't find on Zillow, Realtor.com, or any other home-search portal.\n\nEach of these homes is technically in violation of Zillow's hotly debated \"Listing Access Standards,\" rules the search giant unveiled last April to crack down on agents — many of them at Compass — sharing homes in some places but not others. The country's most popular home-search portal has gone so far as to ban some listings from its vaunted website, which Zillow says is necessary to stem the rising tide of exclusive listings and preserve a fair and open marketplace: \"If a listing is online, it should be online everywhere,\" begins one of the company's blog posts.\n\nThe ban prompted a swift legal response from Compass, which sued Zillow in federal court, claiming the search site was using its monopoly power to quash competition. Compass may not want its listings on Zillow right away, but it does want them there eventually: CEO Robert Reffkin has likened the \"private exclusive\" phase to a movie trailer that drums up hype before a wider release. If Zillow bans listings, that wide release loses its luster.\n\nOn Friday, Zillow scored an early victory in the legal battle: A judge denied Compass's request for a preliminary injunction, which would have forced Zillow to stop enforcing its new rules. Compass' lawyers failed to show that Zillow is actually a monopoly, the judge concluded, so the so-called \"Zillow Ban\" lives — for now.\n\nThe judge's ruling is a big step in the real estate listing war, but the future of home search still looks murky.\n\nFor one thing, it's not even clear that Zillow really wants to enforce its own rules. Under the company's Listing Access Standards, agents who market a home publicly — posting a sign in the front yard, advertising the listing on their brokerage's website, or merely teasing its existence via Compass' black box — have one business day to share the home with everyone or risk having it blacklisted from Zillow. During the injunction hearing, though, the company revealed that it had sent about 1,200 warnings and banned just 50 homes from its site over a roughly four-month period last year. Internal documents also showed executives fretting over the risks of turning away agents and their listings. It's not a great look for the biggest name in home search to openly admit that it can't — or won't — show you every home for sale. Zillow may keep up its tepid enforcement of the ban, and it may very well deter some agents, especially those reliant on Zillow's reach, from following Compass' lead. But it won't stop these \"exclusive listings\" from proliferating.\n\n\"Zillow's not going to go out and ban thousands of listings,\" says Mike DelPrete, a tech strategist and scholar-in-residence at the University of Colorado Boulder. \"They'd be shooting themselves in the foot.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Compass just keeps getting more powerful. Since the courtroom proceedings in November, the company has sidestepped regulatory scrutiny (thanks to some savvy politicking) to close on its acquisition of the second-largest brokerage in the US, Anywhere Real Estate, which owns household names like Corcoran, Century 21, and Coldwell Banker, among others. The combined company, including franchisees, would account for almost a quarter of nationwide home sales volume based on last year's figures, according to an analysis by T3 Sixty, a real estate management consulting firm. More agents mean more listings, which makes Compass' stockpile of exclusive homes all the more valuable. If Compass continues to advertise listings only on its own platforms — in internal databases or simply on the public-facing side of its website — it could attract even more agents and clients by promising them an edge in home search. \"Come here,\" the pitch goes, \"and you'll get access to a VIP room filled with the area's hottest listings.\" As one longtime real estate executive told me last year, \"Listings are fuel.\"\n\nThe legal setback doesn't amount to a total loss for Compass. Its antitrust case against Zillow will continue to wind its way through the courts, and the company could still prevail in a jury trial. Or Compass could simply decide to pursue its vision regardless of the courtroom result. \"We'll never give up,\" Reffkin, Compass' CEO, told me at company headquarters late last year, when I pressed him on the possibility that the legal battle doesn't go his way. Even if Zillow blocks some listings from its platform, Compass may plow ahead under the assumption that buyers and their agents will gravitate toward any place that offers them a leg up in their home search. And while Zillow may come out on top in the courtroom, the underlying state of play probably won't change. Compass still maintains thousands of home listings that are unavailable on other search portals. Other big brokerages are following suit, building up their own stockpiles of exclusive inventory in preparation for a world in which listings are more closely guarded rather than shared broadly from the get-go.\n\nIf you're looking to buy a house, this reality could make choosing an agent all the more fraught. Not only will you have to gauge their grasp on the local market or their negotiating chops, but you'll also have to consider how many listings you could gain early access to by choosing their brokerage. Some agents have always been able to unlock more inventory than others, via \"private listing networks\" or chummy relationships with potential sellers in the area. But if brokerages encourage more of their agents to share homes internally before making their broader debut, bigger companies like Compass could gain a decisive advantage, particularly in markets where they control a significant share of listings. This shift could make it more difficult to shrug off an agent and go it alone, or weaken your negotiating position if you want to bargain down your agent's fees. It also raises the real possibility of house-hunting FOMO: Even if the vast majority of these listings are eventually shared everywhere, you may have already missed the chance to be first in line for your dream home.\n\nFor now, these are still mostly hypothetical — the judge's ruling on a Friday morning didn't alter the status quo. It did, however, offer a preview of the messiness to come: more legal barbs, more blog posts, and, most importantly, more listings squirreled away in private databases or posted beyond Zillow's reach. Homebuyers, take note: The old way of searching for homes is fading fast.\n\nJames Rodriguez is a correspondent on Business Insider's Discourse team.",

    "description": "TikTok dances won't make you an A-list celebrity anymore. But niche content creators make substantial incomes and are having a moment.",
    "fullText": "Sorry, but you're not going to be the next MrBeast. In fact, YouTube's top creator might be part of a dying breed of megastars.\n\nAs algorithms on TikTok and Instagram become more personalized, everyone's For You page is tailored to them. That means creators aren't appearing to new audiences as often, which is hurting their chances of becoming universally recognized celebrities.\n\nIt's the \"hardest it's ever been to break through the noise and become a big macro creator,\" Reed Duchscher, MrBeast's former manager, told Business Insider.\n\nWe're entering the era of the \"niche creator,\" and it's changing how talent agents, managers, investors, and other industry executives think about the influencer business. Few are betting on the idea of incubating influencers into A-list stars. The new strategy is all about finding creators who make specialized content, have a small but fiercely loyal fan base, and are hungry to build businesses outside the social feed.\n\nThere are vastly more creators than ever before. The Interactive Advertising Bureau estimated last year that there are about 1.5 million full-time content creators. Millions of amateurs are posting videos for fun or as a side hustle, and AI video generators are making it easier than ever to spit out content.\n\nWithout appealing to a specific community, it's harder than ever to get seen at all.\n\n\"I would not want to try to break into the creator sphere right now if I didn't have a niche,\" said Kelsey Reese, a TikTok creator who makes DIY and fashion content.\n\nFor those who missed the window for global TikTok fame — which saw the emergence of Charli D'Amelio, Addison Rae, and Khaby Lame — the path to a creator career requires a clear strategy.\n\n\"At this point, to grow, you have to contribute something new and something different,\" Reese said. It's \"a lot more difficult than posting a little TikTok dance.\"\n\nTikTok's early years were defined by a monoculture — or as close as social media could get — featuring creators like the Hype House crew.\n\nYou could hack your way to the top of everyone's TikTok feeds by collabing with the right creators or jumping incessantly on trends — does anyone remember Jason Derulo's 2020 campaign? New faces broke into the mainstream each year.\n\nThe 10 most popular creators on TikTok this quarter are roughly the same from a year ago, with just one new entrant, Indonesian influencer Willie Salim, according to follower data from analytics firm Social Blade. That's different from early 2021, a moment of rapid user growth at TikTok, when five new faces entered the app's top 10 compared to the previous year.\n\nYouTube stars are similarly static in 2026. Its top 10 creators this quarter are identical to a year ago, according to Social Blade's global subscriber tallies. MrBeast has been the platform's most followed individual creator since 2022.\n\nThe top talent lock-in is changing how talent agents and managers think about who to sign next.\n\nFinding someone who can break through at a global scale \"feels really, really difficult in today's day and age,\" said Kai Gayoso, a managing partner at Range Media Partners. Gayoso said he cares less about follower counts and views prospective talent through the lens of \"what can we as representation do to go and build a really compelling business that can exist on its own and actually scale, potentially outside of the creator.\"\n\nFor Nick Jacklin, a partner at Underscore Talent, growing talent is all about drilling down to what's made their content appealing.\n\n\"We're helping them just narrow their focus,\" he said. \"This is what seems to be working. Let's double down on this for six or nine or 12 months.\"\n\nTrying to find the next MrBeast is not a practical business plan. Instead, it's about tracking down a talented content creator with an entrepreneurial drive.\n\n\"These creators are not going to be generalists,\" Duchscher said. \"They're going to be very specific to their niche, and then we're going to be able to build production companies and businesses with them in that specific vertical.\"\n\nBeing popular in a narrow category can lead to big revenue, even if you don't reach Kardashian-level fame.\n\nA main area of focus for creators' teams is influencer marketing, where US spend is expected to cross $12 billion this year, according to a forecast from EMARKETER, Business Insider's sister company.\n\nFor talent with a clearly defined vertical, the sponsorship pitch to brands can be straightforward, Jacklin said. A creator who mostly cooks pasta in videos can easily sell their audience to Barilla or De Cecco, for example.\n\nIt's also more obvious which products an influencer should consider launching themselves, Duchscher said. That pasta creator could roll out a line of tomato sauces with their face on the jar.\n\nSlow Ventures, a venture capital firm that invests in creators' businesses, is looking for influencers with authority in particular communities. Being limited in what you post about can be a key part of the appeal.\n\nIt's not just about making dog grooming videos, it's about being the \"go-to pet groomer for Australian Huskies with this length hair,\" Slow Ventures' partner Megan Lightcap said.\n\n\"For us, taking a bet on these super niche and vertical creators was just way more defensible than backing broad-name, bigger kinds of celebrities,\" she said. \"At the end of the day, you're betting on their ability to retain attention, which is just so hard.\"\n\nSome creators are turning to alternative platforms to make money, like Discord and Substack, where niche content thrives. Nick Norwitz, a health YouTuber and Underscore client, used Substack to launch his science newsletter, for instance.\n\nEstella Struck, founder of talent management firm Viviene, said that in-person events are another avenue for creators.\n\nWith AI content overload and the generalized experience of being \"chronically online\" for nearly a decade, \"people want human connection,\" Struck said.\n\nInfluencers are hosting their own events or working with brand partners to bring that online community into the real world.\n\nReese — one of Struck's clients who has over 200,000 Instagram followers and 428,000 on TikTok — said she isn't looking to get \"super famous.\"\n\n\"I just want to be successful and have an abundant platform to show off my work,\" she said, \"and make a comfortable income from it.\"",

    "description": "\"I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career,\" wrote Siddhant Khare. \"I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career.\"",
    "fullText": "The software engineers are not alright.\n\nAI was supposed to make programming easier. Siddhant Khare said that while AI tools have made him more productive, his job is now harder than ever.\n\n\"We used to call it an engineer, now it is like a reviewer,\" Khare told Business Insider. \"Every time it feels like you are a judge at an assembly line and that assembly line is never-ending, you just keep stamping those PRs.\"\n\nKhare wrote a lengthy essay titled \"AI fatigue is real and nobody talks about it.\" In it, he wrote that AI fatigue is \"the kind of exhaustion that no amount of tooling or workflow optimization could fix.\"\n\n\"I shipped more code last quarter than any quarter in my career,\" he wrote. \"I also felt more drained than any quarter in my career.\"\n\nKhare, who is a software engineer at ONA, makes AI tools himself. He said he's not against AI, he just wants people, including software engineers like himself, to find a more sustainable way to use the technology.\n\nThe issue, Khare wrote, is that AI creates a paradox of productivity that falls almost entirely on the user to solve by reducing the cost of production but increasing \"the cost of coordination, review, and decision-making.\"\n\nHis typical day is no longer devoted to deep focus on a single design problem, Khare wrote, but rather to context switching between as many as six different problems.\n\n\"Each one 'only takes an hour with AI.' But context-switching between six problems is brutally expensive for the human brain,\" he wrote. \"The AI doesn't get tired between problems. I do.\"\n\nEarly reactions show Khare isn't alone. Fellow engineers have shared their thoughts on X, Hacker News, and Lobsters. Their experiences echo what Khare wrote: vibe coding can lead to burnout vibes.\n\n\"I joke that I'm on the 'Claude Code workout plan' now,\" one user wrote on Hacker News. \"Standing desk, while it's working I do a couple squats or pushups or just wander around the house to stretch my legs. Much more enjoyable than sitting at my desk, hands on keyboard, all day long. And taking my eyes off the screen also makes it easier to think about the next thing.\"\n\nOthers make their day sound like the \"C'mon do something meme\" as they wait for a coding agent to respond with results, which they will then have to edit and refine.\n\n\"I used to lose myself in focused work for hours,\" another user wrote. \"That's changed. Now I'm constantly pulled away, and I've noticed the pattern: I send a prompt, wait for the reply, and drift into browsing.\"\n\nOn Monday, Harvard Business Review published a report on an eight-week study at a US tech company with 200 employees that \"discovered that AI tools didn't reduce work, they consistently intensified it.\"\n\n\"Once the excitement of experimenting fades, workers can find that their workload has quietly grown and feel stretched from juggling everything that's suddenly on their plate,\" the report continued. \"That workload creep can in turn lead to cognitive fatigue, burnout, and weakened decision-making.\"\n\nKhare said another struggle he has had is keeping up with the number of updates from OpenAI, Anthropic, and other AI companies as they push their popular models and agents.\n\n\"Once you open your laptop, your phone either you go to Slack, Twitter, LinkedIn, GitHub, and these are all things that are like 'Look at me,'\" Khare said.\n\nThe companies need to keep innovating to stay apace in the AI race, but for programmers like himself, Khare said, the updates create a sense of panic about missing out on what could be the next greatest thing.\n\n\"I was spending weekends evaluating new tools,\" he wrote. \"Reading every changelog. Watching every demo. Trying to stay at the frontier because I was terrified of falling behind.\"\n\nUltimately, Khare wrote that the scariest thing was how AI was changing him. He said he struggled when someone asked him \"to reason through a concurrency problem on the whiteboard\" with no laptop or AI.\n\n\"It's like GPS and navigation. Before GPS, you built mental maps. You knew your city. You could reason about routes,\" he wrote. \"After years of GPS, you can't navigate without it. The skill atrophied because you stopped using it.\"\n\nAndrej Karpathy, Tesla's former AI head and the engineer who coined the term \"vibe coding\" last year, recently wrote that while the industry was seeing a \"phase shift\" among increasingly impressive AI coding tools, he'd also begun to notice skill atrophy.\n\n\"I've already noticed that I am slowly starting to atrophy my ability to write code manually,\" Karpathy wrote.\n\nDetermined to help himself, Khare wrote that he had come up with a list of ground rules to rein in his AI use.\n\nHe's still struggling to hold himself to it. He said almost completely ignoring the AI conversation over his 14-day holiday break was a start. Khare said that while he wrote that having a 30-minute timer on AI use is helpful, it wasn't intended to be a strict limit.\n\nThe engineer also said that AI companies themselves could help as well. He compared the feeling of being just one prompt away from a perfect answer to the way addictive games try to keep users playing.\n\n\"You need to keep some sort of guardrails for the humans, so they don't self-distruct themselves,\" he said.",

    "fullText": "Harvey, the $8 billion legal software startup, is becoming a default vendor in Big Law. Now, with rival startups nipping at its heels and AI model providers moving closer to legal workflows, Harvey is bringing in a new executive to help defend its lead.\n\nThe company tells Business Insider it has hired Anique Drumright as its first chief product officer. In this role, she'll shape what Harvey builds next and how quickly it can ship. Drumright has held roles at Uber, TripActions, Loom, and, most recently, HR software startup Rippling, where she led the company's push into IT management software.\n\n\"Her slope of learning is very high,\" said Winston Weinberg, Harvey's chief executive. He described sending Drumright a lengthy Google Doc on the state of law firm technology and the day-to-day mechanics of legal work. She came back quickly with \"really good product ideas,\" he said.\n\nThe C-suite hire comes at a critical moment for Harvey — and for legal tech more broadly. Law firms are pouring money into new software meant to help lawyers work faster and save costs. Clients are driving much of that spend. After seeing chatbots and virtual assistants transform their own operations, they now expect the same efficiency from outside counsel.\n\nThose tools don't come cheap, and recent moves by the model providers themselves have complicated the picture. Anthropic's release last week of a contract-review tool sent ripples through the industry and led to a major sell-off of legal-research stocks. It raised a pointed question: If a foundation model can review contracts, on top of handling tasks across the rest of the organization, how much specialized legal software will firms still pay for?\n\nHarvey sits at the top of the heap for now. The startup has emerged as one of the best-known and best-funded players in legal tech, with licenses at over half of the 100 largest US law firms. The company said it ended last year with more than $190 million in annual recurring revenue. And job postings reviewed by Business Insider suggest it is pushing into mid-market and smaller firms, a long tail of potential growth beyond Big Law.\n\nEarlier this week, Forbes reported that Harvey is raising a new round of funding that would value the company at $11 billion, citing unnamed people familiar with the deal. A Harvey spokesperson declined to comment on the report.\n\nHarvey's dominance comes with pressure. The company still needs to show lawyers its product can boost revenue, not just save hours. At the same time, competition is intensifying, from legal software startups like Legora and from OpenAI and Anthropic, the same companies whose technology powers Harvey's platform.\n\nWeinberg said Anthropic's latest release doesn't change Harvey's product direction, but it does emphasize the need to move faster on shipping what makes the company distinctive. \"Part of hiring Anique is to accelerate that,\" he said.\n\nIf the next fight is adoption, Drumright has put in the reps. She's spent years building products that ask people to change their habits.\n\nAt Uber, she worked in product and marketing as the ride-hailing giant scaled to billions of trips a year. Later, at Loom, she helped grow a product that nudged office workers away from meetings and long email chains, replacing them with screen-recorded video messages.\n\nDrumright faces a similar challenge at Harvey, where the company has to convince reluctant lawyers, a famously luddite profession, to trade the familiar way of doing things for new tools. Those take time to use effectively.\n\n\"When something is new, even if it's powerful, it's still harder to do than the way you've always done it,\" she said. Her job, she said, is to make those new capabilities feel intuitive.\n\nDrumright is the daughter of two lawyers, and she has seen firsthand how low-tech legal work can be. She remembers her mother siting on the couch, preparing for a deposition by speaking into a tape recorder.\n\nDrumright starts on Tuesday. Her first weeks at Harvey will be spent on a listening tour, meeting lawyers using the product and legal teams deciding whether to buy it. \"Legal is a very specific domain,\" she said, but the work starts with understanding how lawyers actually work today, and designing products that don't slow them down.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Daniel Fayemi, a 28-year-old senior software and blockchain engineer living in Toronto. It has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nOver the past seven years, I've worked for multiple companies shipping blockchain integrations and production-grade financial infrastructure in Lagos, Amsterdam, and now Toronto.\n\nI started my career in Nigeria, where I was born and raised, and moved to Amsterdam in May 2023 after a short career break for a job as a senior software engineer. I returned to Nigeria after a year and worked until I received my Canadian work visa through my wife in October 2024.\n\nSince May 2025, I've worked as a senior software engineer at Source Inc. in Toronto, and I do some consulting on the side. I make a six-figure salary, plus restricted options in the same range.\n\nI really like living in Canada.\n\nMy then-girlfriend, now wife, was in school in Toronto, and I decided to join her. Professionally, I was also excited to work in the North American market and build products for a global audience from here.\n\nI was excited about moving, but mostly I was nervous. The costs add up fast … legal fees, travel, and finding a home in Toronto where my wife and I could settle. We put a lot of our savings on the line, and I was scared of not making something meaningful out of that money, effort, and sacrifice.\n\n\"Expensive\" is relative, but it's not just the price in Toronto; it's the space. You pay a lot for not much.\n\nFood can be expensive here, too. I saved \n\nTips, too, were a real money culture shock. In Lagos and Amsterdam, tipping is fully voluntary and even a little frowned upon. Here, they say it's optional, but the prompts are right there, leaving you with little choice. I get why it exists, but it took getting used to.\n\nCompared to Nigerian groceries, Amsterdam was actually more expensive than Toronto and harder to find, so I understand those prices. The funniest adjustment for me was actually grocery shopping.\n\nI landed last year, thinking I would do a classic Nigerian bulk run so I wouldn't have to keep going out in the cold. I pushed three heavy grocery bags through the lobby and the concierge, two neighbors in the elevator, and a guy in my hallway all asked if we were throwing a party. I learned fast.\n\nMy first culture shocks in Canada were the weather and the work culture. I'm usually fast-paced at work, and I've had to tone it down a bit. Also, as someone from Lagos who thought Amsterdam cold was \"real,\" Toronto taught me otherwise. I love the cold, or maybe I'm just not scared of it now.\n\nIn Toronto, if it's pouring or a heat alert is in effect, our team quietly switches to working from home. No drama, just \"see you on Slack.\" In the Netherlands, we still went in unless the weather was truly extreme. In Nigeria, you went in, period.\n\nThe second shock was leadership. My managers are genuinely kind and low-ego. There's no visible \"upper floor.\" People jump into the same document and solve the problem. Coming from what I joke is the \"Respect Capital of the World,\" Lagos, that felt radical at first.\n\nI like the occasional chit-chat with folks just starting out. Because most of my close friends here are software engineers at different levels, I don't feel a strong need for what the broader tech community has to offer. I still run a small mentorship back in Nigeria, and I think I need to focus on getting my feet under me here first.\n\nCompared with Lagos and parts of Europe, Canada feels more workplace-centered, so in Toronto, I rely on LinkedIn, Slack, and Discord for news and new opportunities. I found my current role on LinkedIn, and I still get about two recruiter messages a week there.\n\nThe groups I'm in are private circles of friends and friends-of-friends where we swap opportunities, do interview prep, workshop startup ideas, and sometimes just hop on to play video games. Sometimes I go on outings with colleagues and friends. We went to an arcade together recently.\n\nOur move has had some challenges. Finding a suitable place in Toronto has been one of the hardest parts of moving here. I recently left the first place I rented when I arrived, and it still took me four months to find a new one, even with all my documents.\n\nIt was a joint application with my wife, who has a good credit score. Because my credit score was still new, landlords kept requesting bank statements for my savings account, and a few also questioned my income. I think we only got this apartment because our real estate agent knew the landlady.\n\nI haven't had a single bad experience here. Toronto has a wide range of food, which I also appreciate. I can get authentic Lebanese shawarma at Shelby's Shawarma one night and the best pasta at Trattoria Mercatto the next, and yes, I've tried the whole menu.\n\nEvery day feels different, and the weather can change multiple times before lunch. I love that on a random Monday at 9 a.m., you might see a long line of people waiting to try a new ice cream brand. Toronto's interesting to watch, and I love it.\n\nI plan to grow into more leadership roles here, work more with AI, and maybe one day build something of my own, most likely something related to blockchain and AI.",

    "description": "Joanelle Cobos was laid off by Amazon in October, her fourth layoff. Planning ahead gave her time to reset, but financial pressure is now mounting.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Joanelle Cobos, a 38-year-old job seeker who lives in Las Vegas. She previously worked for Amazon as a design manager until being laid off last October. The following has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nLast October, I was getting ready to head to the office when I noticed two text messages from Amazon that looked like spam, asking me to click a link or check my email. I soon learned that after nearly four years with the company, I'd been laid off — my third layoff since 2019 and the fourth in my career.\n\nSince I'd dealt with job losses so many times, I don't think this layoff affected me emotionally as much as it did some of my coworkers. The idea of having so much free time ahead of me was exciting.\n\nNow, my job search feels like a ticking time bomb, but I'm not in a rush to jump into another large corporation.\n\nAfter dealing with nine months of unemployment during my previous layoff, I'd started planning my life around the possibility of losing my job.\n\nI was also preparing to be laid off at Amazon, because my tenure had been plagued by whispers of voluntary resignation programs and job cuts, basically once a year. My job never felt particularly secure.\n\nBecause of the financial cushion I'd built, the paychecks I would receive from Amazon during my continuation period, the severance that followed, and my experience dealing with layoffs before, I didn't feel immediate financial pressure.\n\nRather than jump into the job hunt, I decided to take a pause from October through the end of the year. This time period felt a little like a paid vacation, and given that it overlapped with the holidays, it was almost the perfect time to get laid off.\n\nThen January came. I'd done some research in the prior months to help inform my next career move, but I knew I'd have to ramp up my job search.\n\nI've started actively applying for jobs — including creative project management and creative operations management roles — but I haven't had much success landing interviews yet. I'm not too stressed for now, but I know my paychecks and severance won't last forever; I'll eventually need additional income to stay afloat financially. Accounting for my severance and emergency fund, I have about 10 to 12 months before I run out of funds.\n\nI've had a hard time staying employed at large corporations for any extended period of time. I've been either laid off or left because the pay and benefits weren't good enough. For now, I'm targeting roles at smaller companies that may not be able to pay as much as a larger company, but where I wouldn't feel like just a \"number\" and the job security might be better.\n\nSmaller companies might also offer more work-from-home flexibility. Prior to the layoff, I'd been required to work from the office five days a week, which was about 45-to-50 minutes each way of commuting. I was still the only one in my office on my team, so there was no in-person collaboration for me to benefit from.\n\nI'd like to take a lower-stress, lower-paying job with good health benefits and bridge the financial gap with income from my own business, though I'm not sure what this would be yet. If my job search drags on, I'd be open to exploring more freelance and contract roles.\n\nAfter my previous layoff, I landed a job at Amazon in part because I had a relative who worked there. I doubt my résumé would have been seen without an employee referral. I'm still looking for my break this time around.\n\nTo boost my chances, I've been using generative AI tools to help with résumés, cover letters, and identifying roles I might be qualified for. It's made the job search far less stressful. What used to take a full day now takes just a few hours.\n\nI have two main pieces of advice for others who have been laid off, including other affected Amazon employees. First, take the time to be upset, but don't stay in that headspace too long because that doesn't help you. Layoffs aren't personal — they're a business decision.\n\nSecond, before looking for a new job that is very similar to your prior role, consider whether it's the best fit for you. If you can swing it financially, take some time to think about where you want to go and what you want to do.\n\nWhile job searching can be frustrating, it's also given me the opportunity to reexamine what I want in my career. If there's anything good that's come from the layoff, it's that it's forced me to take time to reflect.",

    "title": "Undersea Drone That Attaches Itself To Other Vessels Unveiled By Lockheed",
    "description": "Lamprey can launch aerial drones, launch decoys, and fire torpedoes after arriving discreetly in an operating area by hitching a ride.",
    "fullText": "Lockheed Martin has rolled out a new uncrewed undersea vehicle called Lamprey, designed to ride to and from operating areas attached to the hulls of ships and submarines. The highly modular design can also be configured to launch aerial drones, torpedoes, and decoys, as well as gather intelligence once it arrives at its destination. Also able to lie in wait on the seabed, Lamprey opens the door to new ways to watch for enemy naval activity and deny their ability to move freely if called upon.\n\nLamprey, which Lockheed Martin describes as a multi-mission autonomous undersea vehicle (MMAUV), has a largely square hullform and 24 cubic feet of internal payload space. It is electrically powered and features a built-in hydrogenerator that allows it to recharge its batteries during missions. It has two propulsors at the rear, as well as two mounted sideways in the body.\n\n“Built with the U.S. Navy’s need for covert, assured access and sea denial operations, LampreyMMAUV can arrive in theater with a fully charged battery. Mimicking nature, it can hitch a ride on a host surface vessel or submarine, utilize hydrogenators to charge batteries and arrive in theater ready for operational missions,” according to a press release put out today. “Lockheed Martin’s LampreyMMAUV can perform a wide range of missions including delivering undersea and air kinetic and non-kinetic effects; performing intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, targeting, and multi-intelligence collection; and deploying equipment to the seafloor. “\n\nAt the time of writing, Lockheed Martin has yet to release more details about the Lamprey’s range, speed, or other specifications beyond its internal payload capacity.\n\nThe aforementioned ability to launch uncrewed aerial systems, for surveillance and kinetic strike, is featured heavily in the material that Lockheed Martin has released so far, including the computer-generated video seen earlier in this story. Renderings show Lampreys equipped with up to three retractable twin-tube launchers, for a total load of up to six drones. The company has told TWZ that the specific aerial drone design seen in the materials it has released so far is meant to be a generic stand-in rather than reflect a specific existing type.\n\nIn terms of kinetic capabilities, Lockheed Martin says Lamprey can be configured to launch lightweight torpedoes from an internal bay, as well.\n\nThe Lamprey is also depicted deploying decoys that are extremely similar, at least externally, to the U.S. Navy’s Mk 39 Expendable Mobile Anti-Submarine Warfare Training Target (EMATT). The EMATT is designed to simulate the acoustic and other signatures of a full-sized submarine.\n\nIn the same way, the MMUAV might be able to deploy sonobouys or other expendable sensors. Lockheed Martin says the undersea drone can carry its own suite of unspecified sensors, as well. This could include sonars, passive radio frequency (RF) signal detection systems, and/or optics that could be employed while submerged or sailing close to the surface.\n\nThe computer-generated video shows Lampreys communicating via a retractable mast while running close to the surface, as well as through nodes on the seabed while submerged. In addition to being able to launch kinetic attacks itself, the MMAUV is depicted passing information to an F-35 Joint Strike Fighter flying overhead, which then fires a missile at a target ship.\n\nHowever, Lamprey’s most significant capability is its ability to latch onto the underside of ships and submarines. This is reflected right in the name, as lamprey eels have circular, suction cup-like mouths with rows of sharp teeth that allow them to lock onto a host fish. Real-life lampreys are parasitic, feeding on their hosts once attached.\n\nThis covert deployment capability opens a number of interesting operational possibilities, especially if the MMAUVs have a high degree of autonomy. Friendly ships and submarines could take groups of Lampreys discreetly to their destination or launch them from the stand-off positions, as well as recover them. They could also be employed from larger uncrewed maritime platforms acting as motherships. With the built-in recharge capability, the undersea drones could be employed repeatedly in the course of a single cruise, depending on their payload and mission set.\n\nAll of this would create immense complications for opponents trying to find and fix the position of the Lampreys, which could conceivably be deployed in virtually any open-ocean or littoral environment. This would all be further compounded by the fact that Lampreys can move around themselves or lie on the seabed for at least some amount of time.\n\nGroups of the uncrewed undersea vehicles could, in turn, offer a new cost-effective way to establish distributed and highly disruptive networks to monitor naval movements across vast areas, and offer an immediate way to attack enemy forces, if required. Lampreys could be seeded into maritime chokepoints or other highly strategic areas to provide additional sea control and anti-access/area denial effects. With their ability to launch uncrewed aerial systems, they could surveil areas or attack targets ashore, as well. The MMAUV would be particularly well-suited to conducting such operations in more remote or otherwise denied areas that might be too risky for or just outright inaccessible to larger crewed ships and submarines.\n\nThe Lamprey’s docking capability raises the possibility that it could latch itself onto enemy ships and simply detonate as an explosive-filled limpet mine. Such an attack might be used to create havoc in a port or block a narrow waterway.\n\nIt should be noted that Lamprey has not yet been shown carrying munitions that would be sufficient to directly sink larger ships. At the same time, as TWZ has highlighted in the past, small loitering munitions, in particular, still cause damage that could lead to a mission kill by targeting sensors and other key systems. Large volume attacks could also eat up a vessel’s ready stocks of anti-air munitions and other countermeasures, something we touched on in a previous feature outline a detailed case for army U.S. Navy ships with drone swarm capabilities. All of this, in turn, could render a target more vulnerable to follow-on attacks or otherwise sideline it for a protracted period of time.\n\nSmaller munitions also present a threat to equally smaller watercraft, crewed and uncrewed, as well as various types of targets on land. Lockheed Martin’s video notably shows loitering munitions launched by Lampreys engaging North Korean-designed missile boats currently in service in Iran, as well as larger surface combatants.\n\nThere is still much to be learned about the Lamprey and its capabilities, especially when it comes to its endurance and ability to operate autonomously. What unit cost Lockheed Martin might be targeting and how easily the MMAUVs can be produced at scale are open questions. What stage of development the Lamprey is currently in is unknown.\n\nLockheed Martin is also not the first to present a concept for a modular and autonomous uncrewed undersea vehicle that could provide an array of valuable distributed capabilities, especially when deployed covertly. As just one example, Anduril rolled out its torpedo-like Copperhead family, which can be configured as underwater kamikaze drones, as well as for other missions. Concepts of operations have been put forward for Copperhead that include deployment from Anduril’s larger Ghost Shark uncrewed mini-submarine and via emplaced nodes on the sea floor.\n\nThe U.S. Navy has at least been experimenting with these kinds of capabilities, including concepts for launching aerial drones from uncrewed underwater vehicles, for years now. The service already has some degree of operational capacity to launch uncrewed aerial systems (and undersea ones) from its crewed submarines.\n\nThere is a growing trend in the development of various tiers of uncrewed undersea vehicles, including types that could be employed in a distributed manner, globally, as well. Chinese authorities showcased a number of previously unseen underwater drone designs during a huge military parade in Beijing last September.\n\nLockheed Martin’s unveiling of Lamprey underscores how the underwater ecosystem facing navies worldwide is continuing to evolve in terms of both capabilities and threats, which could also extend into the aerial domain.\n\nContact the author: joe@twz.com",

    "fullText": "Midwest farmers are facing challenges growing an important crop, according to Yale Climate Connections.\n\nGarlic yields in Wisconsin are down dramatically, according to one farmer.\n\n\"What we've seen with excessive amounts of rain is we'll have more pests and disease in that crop, and in the last two years, I've only been able to make 400 pounds,\" said Josh Bryceson. Normally, he harvests 2,000 pounds each year. \"It's very common to hear rain eroding ground to the point where it can't be planted anymore.\"\n\nWhile wet weather has been a major problem for farmers fighting pests and fungal infections, droughts have been at least as damaging to crop yields worldwide.\n\nThe economic losses to farmers and the nutritional loss of falling agricultural yields are both big challenges, but they're not the only problems.\n\nDeclining farm yields due to worsening weather patterns are a critical climate issue. Farmers across America are seeing important crops like apples, wheat, and corn fail at record rates. This contributes to rising prices at the grocery store and worsens food security, especially for low-income families.\n\nAtmospheric pollution is driving the wetter weather that's plaguing garlic crops. As pollution has trapped heat in the atmosphere, the severity of storms and flooding has increased. In addition to damaging farmland, these disasters also wreak havoc on housing, creating a spike in insurance rates.\n\nAs director of grower support programs at local non-profit Good Acre, Bryceson had a wealth of advice for fellow farmers. For one, he suggested not relying too much on a single crop to avoid hardship should it fail.\n\nHe promoted the use of cover crops between harvests to prevent soil erosion. Covered structures can also help to protect crops from harsh conditions.

    "fullText": "BEIRUT (AP) — Israelis forces seized a local official with a Sunni Islamist group and an ally of the Palestinian militant Hamas group in an operation in southern Lebanon early on Monday, and took him to Israel for questioning, the Israeli military and Lebanese state media reported.\n\nAlso on Monday, an Israeli drone struck a car in the southern Lebanese village of Yanouh, killing three people, including a 3-year-old child, Lebanon’s state-run National News Agency said, quoting the Health Ministry.\n\nThe Israeli military later said it struck Hezbollah artillery official Ahmad Salami. It said it was aware of a “claim that uninvolved civilians were killed” and that the case is under review.\n\nAccording to the NNA agency, Atwi Atwi — a local official with the Sunni Islamist group al-Jamaa al-Islamiya, or the Islamic Group in English — was taken in the southern village of Hebbarieh, in the region of Hasbaya and close to the border with Israel.\n\nA statement from the Israeli military said Israeli troops apprehended an Islamic Group official in a “targeted intelligence-based operation.” It did not release the official's name.\n\nThe Islamic Group condemned the seizure, saying it was part of Israel’s daily attacks and violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty. It called on the Lebanese state to work for the release of Atwi.\n\nThe Islamic Group is Lebanon's branch of the Muslim Brotherhood, a pan-Islamist political group, with an armed wing in Lebanon known as Fajr Forces.\n\nAfter the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023, the Fajr Forces joined forces with the Lebanese Shiite militant Hezbollah group, launching rockets across the border into Israel that it said were in support of Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThe Brotherhood has been outlawed in much of the Middle East and labeled a terror group. Last month, the Trump administration designated the Lebanese, Jordanian and Egyptian branches of the Brotherhood as terrorist organizations.\n\nAl-Jamaa al-Islamiya's leader, Mohammed Takkoush, said during the 14-month war between Hezbollah and Israel that his group and Hezbollah put aside their differences on conflicts in Syria and Yemen to join forces against Israel.\n\nHezbollah started attacking Israel on Oct. 8, 2023, a day after Hamas attacked southern Israel, triggering the latest Israel-Hamas war. Israel later launched a widespread bombardment of Lebanon that severely weakened Hezbollah, followed by a ground invasion.\n\nThe conflict ended with a U.S.-brokered ceasefire in 2024, and since then, Israel has carried out almost daily airstrikes and ground incursions into Lebanon that left more than 100 civilians dead according to the United Nations. Israel says it's carrying out the operations to remove Hezbollah strongholds and threats against Israel.\n\nThe Israel-Hezbollah war killed more than 4,000 people in Lebanon, including hundreds of civilians, and caused an estimated $11 billion in damage and destruction, according to the World Bank. In Israel, 127 people died, including 80 soldiers.",

    "title": "Protein isn't a weight loss miracle. A leading protein expert explains how to incorporate it into your routine for the best results.",
    "description": "Protein expert Stuart Phillips says you may be overdoing it on protein-forward ultra-processed foods.",
    "fullText": "If you've been on the internet, listened to a podcast, or shopped for food anywhere lately, you've probably heard the great news about protein.\n\nProtein is being touted as the best thing to consume to build muscle, lose weight, suppress appetite, balance hormones, enhance longevity, curb menopause, and even improve your metabolism.\n\nThere is some truth here. Protein can help you build and maintain muscle. It can also impact metabolism and has a real, albeit quite mild, effect on how full you feel after you eat.\n\nWe need some protein in our diet to provide the essential amino acids our body can't make on its own, which are critical for cellular tasks, including tissue repair, muscle building, and boosting immunity. But most of the visible benefits of protein consumption — the ones you can see in the mirror — don't kick in automatically, without some external stimulus.\n\n\"None of it is really actually true unless you're combining it with a pretty good dose of physical activity,\" professor Stuart Phillips, chair of the kinesiology department at McMaster University, told Business Insider.\n\nPhillips said that protein is simply the \"small dressing on top that allows the big stimulus of exercise to have its influence.\"\n\nHe recommends a simple weekly exercise routine, plus enough daily protein to drive results, and he shared ways anyone can optimize the idea for their own goals and body.\n\nIf you change nothing else about your diet or workout routine, and only add in more protein-rich foods, you will probably gain weight.\n\nOur bodies can't store extra protein, so when it's not immediately used up, we turn it into carbohydrates for fuel. Once our fuel needs are met (in glycogen stores), the rest of that once-protein becomes fat.\n\n\"It's pretty benign in terms of its effects, other than you might feel a little bit fuller,\" Phillips said. \"The hype around protein definitely outpaces the reality of what's going to happen.\"\n\nPhillips, who has studied the effects of regular exercise on human skeletal muscle for 30 years and is one of the world's leading scholars on how to combine protein and exercise — with over 400 scientific publications to his name. He typically recommends strength training with weights that challenge your ability two to three times per week for best results.\n\nPhillips tracks his own protein intake very judiciously, in line with his muscle-building goals, never pushing past a well-trodden benchmark that is something of an industry standard protein dose.\n\nPhillips said he aims for \"probably 1.5 to 1.6\" grams per kilogram of protein every day — at the upper limit of the new Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which recommend people aim for anywhere from 1.2 to 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight in protein every day. That's a big hike from the old federal recommendation of 0.8 grams per kilogram, but 1.2 to 1.6 grams isn't a big jump for most people.\n\nAs it turns out, most of us are doing just fine getting at least 1.2 grams per kilogram of protein per day, according to federal estimates of \"what we eat in America\" from the US Department of Agriculture. The latest data available, from March 2020, suggests the average American gets in about 1.22 grams per kilogram of of protein each day, and roughly 25% of Americans, the ones eating the most protein, are getting anywhere from 1.58 grams to more than 3 grams.\n\nPhillips' personal protein target amounts to about:\n\nThat's roughly 30 to 50 grams of protein per meal.\n\nTwo cups of cooked chickpeas, or one cup of cottage cheese could each get you near 30 grams. A medium-sized chicken breast would get you closer to 50 grams. Not everyone needs this much protein, but it can be beneficial for people focused on muscle building, healthy aging, and sustainable weight loss. Bumping up protein intake can help preserve muscle mass, which is ideal for body recomposition — but it has to be paired with a moderate calorie deficit for weight loss to occur.\n\nNutrition expert Christopher Gardner, a professor of medicine and nutrition science at Stanford University who previously served as a scientific advisor to the government on healthy eating, said it's \"OK\" to get more protein into your diet if you want to build muscle, but he worries that in the current craze for more protein, people will skimp on fiber-rich foods. Most Americans do not get enough fiber every day, and fiber-rich, plant-based diets are consistently linked to better longevity and health outcomes.\n\n\"I'd like to see people hedge their bets,\" Gardner said, and incorporate more plant foods into their diet that include both protein and fiber, like beans, peas, soy, and nuts. \"The protein craze in packaged, processed junk foods is simply the latest marketing strategy.\"\n\nShoppers are gobbling up the protein hype. Brick and mortar sales of foods labeled as an \"excellent\" source of protein are up 4.8% over the past year, according to NielsenIQ data, while sales of performance nutrition powders labeled as an \"excellent\" source of protein are up roughly 15%.\n\n\"Everybody's got the message, but the whole idea is now we need to put protein into other places where it has no place being,\" Phillips said.\n\nProtein water, protein chips and cookies, portable protein shots. He doesn't do any of that.\n\nPhillips typically skips protein powders too because he already gets all the protein he needs from protein-rich foods, with a mix of plant and animal proteins — whole foods that provide other nutrients powders can't in a synergistic way. He knows that some protein-billed products aren't doing much for you; for example collagen protein has a protein quality score of zero, meaning your body isn't getting any protein-building benefits from it, whereas something like a chicken egg gets a near-perfect protein quality score.\n\nSome of Phillips' favorite all-time favorite protein-rich whole foods include Greek yogurt for breakfast, plus fermented kefir, lunches like tuna fish sandwiches, and chicken or fish for dinner, while Gardner says you could probably stand to add more protein-rich fiber-filled foods like beans, nuts, and soy into your diet.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI's next funding round could be good news for four Big Tech stocks with links to the ChatGPT creator, DA Davidson says.\n\nOpenAI isn't publicly traded — at least not yet — but DA Davidson says a fresh wave of hype is coming on the heels of its next fundraising round, and it could could boost four stocks in its orbit.\n\n\"We have been very critical on OpenAI overpromising, asking for government handouts and being spread too thin,\" DA Davidson analysts, led by Gil Luria, wrote about the AI company.\n\n\"We believe OpenAI's behavior led to the underperformance in shares of NVDA, MSFT, CRWV and especially ORCL over the last 5 months.\"\n\nOpenAI is reportedly closing in on another fundraising round, with recent reports suggesting a $50 billion investment from Middle Eastern sovereign wealth funds is in the works.\n\nFuturum CEO and analyst Daniel Newman told Business Insider that they expect the next funding round will bring OpenAI's valuation to $750 billion to $850 billion.\n\nThe analyst described the appetite for OpenAI in his conversations with investors to be \"pretty insatiable.\"\n\nDA Davidson analysts wrote that they expect that yet another multibillion-dollar OpenAI funding round will reignite enthusiasm for the company and lift some connected AI stocks.\n\n\"Since the market is currently assigning the OpenAI relationship a negative value, we believe the fundraise will serve as a catalyst for outperformance,\" they wrote of Oracle, CoreWeave, Nvidia, and Microsoft.\n\nOpenAI has come under fire for its reliance on debt and growing competition challenging its dominant position.\n\nThe company is partnered with Oracle to build $500 billion of data centers as part of its Stargate project. OpenAI has yet to turn a profit.\n\nAnother concern weighing on OpenAI is the notion that Alphabet's Google Gemini has caught up in the AI race.\n\n\"We believe that a revamped OpenAI will return to its position as Google's top challenger and with a fresh stack of capital be able to live up to its obligations this year, including to Oracle,\" they said.\n\nThe analysts upgraded Oracle to Buy from Neutral on their expectation that new funding for OpenAI will be a positive catalyst for the stock as well as general sentiment about OpenAI and the connected players.\n\n\"We expect that as investors go back to seeing OpenAI as a winner, the public companies in its orbit could re-rate significantly. Most importantly that should drive outperformance in NVDA and MSFT, but also in CRWV, and even ORCL, which we are upgrading today based on our updated view on OpenAI,\"\n\nTheir more bullish stance on OpenAI comes after the company corrected course.\n\n\"OpenAI has started focusing on its core frontier model and ChatGPT, while de-emphasizing some marginals initiatives. This includes going down the path of turning on ads, which will be critical for increased monetization and reduced cash burn.\"\n\nThey also noted a shift in the company's management that suggests they see a need to align with Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, rather than compete.",

    "description": "The jamming cut soldiers off from commanders and limited what they could see. They located the source and took it out with mortars.",
    "fullText": "Much like the war in Ukraine, future battlefields could be drowning in electronic interference, so the US Army stress-tested new command-and-control tech against that threat.\n\nThe need to maintain connections between command and deployed weapons and crews, or reestablish those links when they're lost, is shaping how soldiers train on the service's Next Generation Command and Control, a new software-driven system that's being developed for the Army.\n\nIn its most recent NGC2 exercise at Fort Carson, Colorado, the Army's 4th Infantry Division put it to the test against electronic warfare. Stressing the system proved difficult, the Army said, because it would \"heal itself.\" The service said it had to disable certain features to really test it.\n\nMaj. Gen. Patrick Ellis, the commander of the 4th ID, said during a media roundtable that after they activated the jamming, the system rerouted internally to keep functioning. \"We had to go back and figure out something else to turn off to actually stress the system to feel that for real,\" he said.\n\nThat further testing saw soldiers in the field lose their connection to satellite services, forcing them to resort to backups like radio for communications while they searched for the source of the jamming.\n\nOnce they found it, they eliminated it with a mortar strike and started the reconnection process.\n\n\"It was quite seamless,\" said Lt. Col. Shawn Scott, commander of the 4th Squadron, 10th Cavalry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, speaking during the roundtable. He added that troops still had to learn how to manage retransmission in complex terrain — an important step in restoring communications when troops are spread out across a wide area.\n\nThe recent exercise put soldiers in a \"denied, degraded, intermittent, and limited\" environment, Scott said, cutting them off from the division's cloud but still allowing the squadron to track the fight and carry out its mission on its own. Once the simulated jamming was removed, \"we were able to reestablish connection back with division and brigade,\" he said, watching data flow back up the chain and back down again \"seamlessly.\"\n\nRussia's war against Ukraine has shown the US military that consistent jamming of communications, weaponry, and intelligence and surveillance capabilities is something it'll need to be prepared for in a future conflict.\n\n\"We don't think the modern battlefield's going to be free of electromagnetic interference,\" Ellis said.\n\nIn this round of testing, the Army fired 155mm rounds from an M777 howitzer at a Marine-provided target. The data from those strikes was then sent back to Marine Corps systems. During the exercise, 20 different types of sensors fed information into NGC2, including drones, electronic warfare systems, and Stryker vehicles.\n\nNGC2 is a major modernization initiative for the Army, changing how soldiers communicate with each other and command, receive intelligence, track locations, and plan warfighting actions like firing artillery or scouting with drones.\n\nJoe Welch, who oversees the Army's command-and-control systems and efforts to counter enemy communications, said that most NGC2 parts are built using off-the-shelf technology and standard commercial software practices, rather than bespoke military-only systems.\n\nData and artificial intelligence capabilities are giving soldiers real-time information, like how much ammo they have left or whether there are casualties to care for, and predictive simulations for what they'll need should enemy forces attack them. The testing at Fort Carson, led by Anduril and an industry team, is continually bringing in more vendors, capabilities, and functions to broaden what NGC2 can do.\n\nWith the new system, the Army is also recognizing what different divisions across the service will need out of it. The process has been driven by implementing soldier feedback quickly, sometimes overnight or within a few days.\n\nIn Hawaii, the Army's 25th Infantry Division is working on a data and applications component of NGC2 led by Lockheed Martin and other companies that, once completed, will also be implemented into what the 4th ID is doing.\n\nFuture exercises are expected to expand what NGC2 can do. One event in May, for instance, will test it against a simulated enemy.\n\n\"We're going to really tests the systems,\" Ellis said, including against cyber, electronic, and kinetic areas to see what vulnerabilities exist. \"We're going to go after all that to learn where we need to make some adjustments.\"",

    "description": "France's Dassault Aviation is currently working on the F5 standard Rafale fighter, also known as the Super Dassault Rafale. How will it compare to the F-35?",
    "fullText": "Whenever there's a discussion around fighter jets, it usually veers towards U.S., Russian, and Chinese-made planes. These include usual suspects like the Lockheed-Martin F-35 Lightning, Russia's Sukhoi Su-57, and the Chinese J-20. While these are advanced planes without an iota of doubt, what most people tend to forget about is the Dassault Rafale. A fourth generation multirole fighter jet designed and developed by French aviation major Dassault, the Rafale is widely thought to be one of the most advanced and formidable fighter jets to ever exist.\n\nOperational since 2004, more than 300 Rafales have been manufactured and have been deployed around the world. Dassault has regularly updated the Rafale, starting with the F1 standard Rafale in 2004, the F2 standard Rafale in 2006, and the F3 standard Rafale developed in 2008. In 2018, Dassault debuted the F-3R Standard Rafale, which was followed by the newest generation of the fighter, the F4 standard Rafale, along with the F4.1 and 4.2 sub-variants.\n\nGiven that Dassault has steadily improved and added newer capabilities to the Rafale over the years, it's not surprising that the company has planned further upgrades to the fighter to keep it operational and relevant well into the 2060s. Dassault's next major upgrade path for the Rafale is the Rafale F5 Standard, which is also unofficially dubbed by many as the Super Dassault Rafale.\n\nPredictably the upcoming Rafale variant will be compared against America's F-35. However, most aviation enthusiasts would know that these two fighter jets cannot be directly compared. The F-35 and the Rafale F5 are not only built for different purposes, they also belong to two entirely different generations of fighter jets.\n\nBefore comparing the Super Dassault Rafale and the F-35, it is important to note that only one of these planes is in service today: the F-35 Lightning. We have already discussed how the Rafale F5 Standard is still in its developmental stages, and per current projections, this version will only enter service in 2030 or later.\n\nMoving on to the capabilities of both planes, the biggest advantage the F-35 has over the Rafale F5 is that it is based on a newer and more advanced platform. The F-35 is a fifth-generation fighter, built from the ground up as a stealth aircraft. It stands out from the current generation of multirole fighters in several ways, and it is widely considered to be the most advanced fighter jet in existence today.\n\nThe Rafale, on the other hand, started life as a fourth-generation fighter, and following several upgrades, it is now classified as a 4.5 or 4.5+ generation aircraft. While it cannot match the F-35 in terms of stealth, the Rafale has excellent electronic warfare capabilities, it can carry a larger number of weapons in typical combat missions, and is cheaper to buy and operate. The Super Dassault Rafale is also slated to receive support for UCAS (Unmanned Combat Air System) drones, a capability that the U.S. is also currently working on.\n\nIn simpler words, while the Super Dassault Rafale will be a formidable, advanced 4.5-generation multirole fighter jet, it falls short of the F-35 in several areas, simply based on fact that the F-35 is a newer-generation fighter. A more direct competitor to the F-35 would be the upcoming sixth-gen fighters; including Europe's Future Combat Air System (FCAS), as well as the U.S.' own, in-development GCAP fighters.\n\nWant the latest in tech and auto trends?

    "fullText": "This year has seen a revival of the \"Sell America\" narrative amid new trade war tensions and Donald Trump's aggressive posturing toward allies.\n\nYet, according to one research firm, investors shouldn't get too worked up about the latest bearish sentiment on America's ties to key trading partners.\n\nAs Trump's tariff policies have weighed on some relationships this year—most notably with the European Union—investors have, in some instances, sold off dollar assets such as stocks, bonds, and the greenback itself. The president's bombastic rhetoric regarding taking over Greenland only gave fresh fuel to Sell America fears earlier this year.\n\nThe events have fueled speculation that the EU could distance itself fro the US, but according to Dan Alamariu, chief geopolitical strategist at investment research firm Alpine Macro, this is unlikely, and \"Sell America\" sentiment is overdone.\n\n\"Markets cite Trump's unconventional domestic and foreign policies, upending of established political norms, rising debt, and ally antagonism as reasons,\" he stated. \"Yet there's a large gap between headlines and structural incentives.\"\n\nThe strategist highlighted the impracticality of coordinated sell-offs, even in times of high uncertainty. Alamariu maintains that a split between the US and the EU, whether in trade or with investors fleeing either market, doesn't make sense.\n\n\"Europe-wide sell-off of U.S. assets is unlikely,\" he stated. \"First, geopolitical tensions are self-limiting and not in either side's interest. Second, investors don't keep long-term geopolitical grudges—especially if tensions trend lower.\"\n\nIn his view, the \"Sell America\" narrative hasn't spread across Europe so far, and there is no evidence that investors are dumping US assets en masse. European investors were still among the leading buyers of US Treasurys last year, government data shows.\n\nChina's recent move urging its banks to scale back US Treasury investments is likely to fuel more talk of \"Sell America.\" Yet, Alamariu argues that positive investor sentiment will continue to outweigh any bearishness on US markets.\n\n\"The Trump administration will try to stimulate the economy in 2026 ahead of the midterms,\" he predicts. \"U.S. dominance of critical fields like high tech and higher innovation propensity means it remains attractive to foreign investors despite policy misgivings.\"\n\nAlamariu believes there is one scenario in which the \"Sell America\" could become a concern for investors. He said that if the US market continues to underperform in the coming year amid major geopolitical disturbances, more investors could pivot to other markets.",

    "title": "$19 billion Lone Pine promotes Rahul Anne as 3 longtime investors exit with plans to launch their own funds",
    "description": "It's the first time the manager has named a new portfolio manager in more than a decade.",
    "fullText": "Lone Pine, the $19 billion equity investment manager founded by billionaire Stephen Mandel Jr., has named its first new portfolio in more than a decade.\n\nThe firm promoted Rahul Anne at the start of the new year, according to a letter to investors seen by Business Insider. Investment decisions going forward will require a sign-off from a majority of Anne and co-chief investment officers David Craver and Kelly Granat, the letter states.\n\nAnne is a 10-year veteran of the Connecticut-based hedge fund and previously worked at KKR and Goldman Sachs. His promotion coincides with the departure of three longtime investors from the firm, according to the letter.\n\nSamuel Harland, Zachary Gleser, and Kevin Salimian have left Lone Pine to \"start their own investment firms,\" the letter states. It's unclear exactly what the trio plans to do, though it is understood they are each operating independently, not creating a new entity together.\n\nHarland, a former Tiger Global investor who led its Carvana investment, could not be reached for comment. Salimian, who joined Lone Pine in 2017 after stints at Eton Park and Viking Global, and Gleser, who worked at Viking Global before joining Lone Pine in 2018, did not return requests for comment.\n\nLone Pine, which made 23% in its long-short hedge fund in 2025, declined to comment.\n\nAfter Mandel stepped aside in 2019, the management of the $19 billion firm's portfolio was taken over by three longtime employees: David Craver, Kelly Granat, and Mala Gaonkar.\n\nGaonkar then left the firm herself in 2022, eventually launching her own fund, and her spot among the investment team's leadership wasn't filled until Anne's promotion.\n\nDeveloping the next generation of firm leadership was top of mind for Granat when she spoke on a 2024 podcast about taking over the manager after Mandel's retirement. The co-chief investment officer said, \"If I'm in this seat in 10 years, that's probably not the best outcome for our LPs.\"\n\nAnne appears to be one person Granat and Craver believe could one day ascend to a CIO role, though his focus at the start will be on managing the portfolio and the investing team, not the firm overall. He's not a member of the firm's five-person management committee, according to Lone Pine's website.\n\nIf Harland, Salimian, and Gleser do follow through on starting their own funds, they will join the broader Tiger Cub family tree, a massive web of hedge funds connected to late billionaire Julian Robertson, the founder of Tiger Management. Mandel, the billionaire founder of Lone Pine, was an analyst at Tiger before starting his own firm, making the new potential spinouts Tiger Grandcubs.\n\nWhile a few Lone Pine launches have struggled to gain traction, Gaonkar's SurgoCap Partners is one of the hottest new funds in the industry and recently surpassed $6 billion in assets under management.\n\nAnother recent launch with Lone Pine connections is Mandel's son, Benjamin, who started Fremen Capital.",

    "title": "Epstein files show prosecutors investigated Leon Black sexual abuse allegations — but he wasn't charged",
    "description": "The Epstein files reveal that prosecutors were looking into misconduct claims against the billionaire and former Apollo CEO Black as far back as 2019.",
    "fullText": "In the wake of Jeffrey Epstein's 2019 death, prosecutors examined sexual assault claims against one of his most powerful associates: Leon Black.\n\nThe Justice Department's newly released Epstein files show prosecutors looked at allegations from at least four women who accused the billionaire former CEO of Apollo Global Management — the key source of Epstein's wealth in the last decade of his life — of sexual assault and other misconduct.\n\nNeither the local Manhattan district attorney's office nor the federal US Attorney's office for the Southern District of New York — the two departments examining the accusations against Black — brought charges against him.\n\nThe newly public files include dozens of emails, internal memos, and records of calls with lawyers for Black's accusers going back to 2019. They include the first known instance that prosecutors investigated whether there was wrongdoing related to Black.\n\nTwo of the women who drew the attention of prosecutors alleged Black raped them in Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2002, claims that mirror those in civil lawsuits filed against Black after Epstein's death. One, who said Black raped her as an adult, has since withdrawn her lawsuit. The other woman's lawsuit, in which she alleged Black raped her as a teenager, is pending. In each case, Black has denied wrongdoing.\n\nLawyers and a spokesperson for Black didn't answer Business Insider's questions about any interactions with law enforcement. Black's attorney, Susan Estrich, pointed to an Apollo-commissioned investigation of Black that she said found \"he had no awareness of Epstein's criminal activities.\"\n\n\"There is absolutely no truth to any of the allegations against Mr. Black,\" Estrich said in a statement.\n\nRepresentatives for the Manhattan District Attorney's office and the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York declined to comment about their inquiries into Black.\n\nEpstein was convicted of state charges for procuring a child for prostitution in 2008 and died in his Manhattan jail cell in 2019 while awaiting trial on federal sex-trafficking charges.\n\nIn March 2021, Black stepped down from his role as CEO and chairman of Apollo, the behemoth he'd cofounded.\n\nThe billionaire's connections to Epstein had been the subject of media and public scrutiny since Epstein's 2019 arrest, prompting an internal investigation that found Black had transferred over $150 million to the convicted sex offender between 2012 and 2017.\n\nThe review found no evidence of criminal activity. The transactions, which Black has said were for tax and estate planning advice, are now under scrutiny by the Senate Finance Committee's investigators.\n\nThe newly released files show that behind the scenes, the Justice Department also looked into Black's ties to Epstein.\n\nA December 2019 memo says that federal prosecutors investigated Epstein's \"potential co-conspirators,\" including Ghislaine Maxwell, who is now serving a 20-year prison sentence and is the only person to be criminally charged for involvement in his sex-trafficking operation.\n\nThe document does not list Black among the potential coconspirators, but includes a summary of a 2019 interview with a woman who told the Justice Department that Epstein directed her to massage Black in Epstein's townhouse. She told investigators she \"ran out of the room\" when Black \"began initiating sexual contact,\" the document said. The document was heavily redacted, and the date of the alleged incident is unclear.\n\nA document from 2021 details allegations relayed to federal prosecutors by Jeanne Christensen, an attorney who specializes in sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuits. Christensen told them she spoke to a woman who alleged that \"Leon Black raped her violently.\"\n\nChristensen's account is that Epstein introduced the woman to Black at his townhouse in 2002 under the pretense that he could help her find work. The woman claimed Black sexually assaulted her in Epstein's massage room, Christensen said.\n\nThe allegations mirror those made in a 2022 civil lawsuit against Black by Cheri Pierson, whom Christensen represented. In the lawsuit, Pierson said she experienced \"excruciating pain\" when Black \"placed his mouth on her vagina and began biting her\" on the massage table.\n\nAccording to Christensen's email to prosecutors, Pierson's allegation resembled the experience of another client who had accused Black of sexual assault. The non-redacted portions of the documents include few other details of this woman's account but show that the Manhattan district attorney's office later closed its investigation into her claims.\n\nBlack has said he never met Pierson, who discontinued her lawsuit, which was dismissed with prejudice, in 2024.\n\nIn February 2023, a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA's office emailed an assistant US Attorney to say the DA's office was looking into a new accusation against Black. It was an extension of an investigation into Epstein and his associates that dated back to 2019, the files show.\n\nThe woman was represented by Christensen and said she \"was trafficked by Maxwell and Epstein,\" the prosecutor said.\n\nThe new accuser's claims, described in memos federal prosecutors wrote, are consistent with the allegations made by the woman who filed the most recent lawsuit against Black, in July 2023, using a \"Jane Doe\" pseudonym.\n\nThe lawsuit, which is pending, alleges the accuser was sexually abused by Epstein in 2002, when she was 16 years old, and trafficked by Epstein and Maxwell to multiple men, including Black.\n\nEstrich, Black's attorney, called the accuser \"a fraud.\"\n\n\"Her birth family says she makes up stories and she fabricates 'evidence,'\" Estrich said in a statement to Business Insider.\n\nA spokesperson for Christensen's law firm, Wigdor LLP, declined to comment. The woman who filed the lawsuit didn't respond to Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nManhattan DA investigators interviewed the woman in January 2023, according to a memo written by a federal prosecutor. The memo said the Manhattan DA's office had \"not found any independent corroboration\" of her allegations \"against JE and LB,\" appearing to refer to Jeffrey Epstein and Leon Black.\n\nFour days before Christensen filed the civil lawsuit on behalf of the accuser, she blasted federal prosecutors for not indicting Black.\n\n\"It's outrageous that criminal charges have not been brought against him,\" Christensen wrote.\n\nA prominent attorney representing other Epstein victims pushed back at the accuser's story, according to the newly released files.\n\nBrad Edwards, who has represented over 100 Epstein accusers, opposed the woman's attempt to join a $290 million class-action settlement from a lawsuit that victims had filed against JPMorgan Chase for allegedly facilitating his sex-trafficking operation, according to a prosecutor's memo.\n\nAccording to the memo, which was based on a conversation the prosecutor had with Christensen, Edwards said in a sealed court hearing that there was no \"corroboration\" for the accuser's claims about her interactions with Epstein, Maxwell, and Black. Edwards told the judge that \"the number of people she claims to be trafficked to is incredible,\" the memo said. Edwards declined Business Insider's request for comment.\n\nUS District Judge Jed Rakoff, who oversaw the class-action lawsuit, \"expressed reluctance to affirm the award\" to the woman \"because he can't understand why there is no corroboration,\" the memo said.\n\nIt isn't clear from the Epstein files or from court records if the woman received funds from the settlement.\n\nChristensen represented a third woman in a civil action against Black: Guzel Ganieva, who in 2021 accused him of rape and trying to pressure her into a sexual encounter with Epstein. It's unclear from the heavily redacted documents if prosecutors looked into the allegations by Ganieva, whose lawsuit was dismissed in 2023 after a judge found her claims were barred by a non-disclosure agreement with Black, who said they had a consensual relationship.\n\nThere's no indication that any criminal inquiry into Black remains active. A June 2024 timeline of the Epstein investigation put together by the FBI referred to it using the past tense: \"The Manhattan District Attorney's office looked into allegations against Leon Black.\"",

    "title": "Meet Molly O'Shea, the VC-turned-podcaster who gets execs like Alex Karp and Palmer Luckey talking",
    "description": "Molly O'Shea's network helped her land interviews with Palantir and Anduril leaders. \"A lot of these people really trust me,\" the Sourcery host said.",
    "fullText": "Molly O'Shea is a name-dropper. There's good reason for that.\n\nI count 29 big names in tech mentioned over our hourlong call. She told me about recently moderating a panel with Kalshi cofounders Tarek Mansour and Luana Lopes Lara. Ken Griffin took the stage after her. O'Shea breezily referenced talking about the state of new media with the TBPN bros in Peter Thiel's house.\n\nBut it's O'Shea's access to executives like these that keeps her audience coming back. The podcaster is deeply immersed in Silicon Valley culture, having several years of venture capital experience under her belt.\n\n\"I am institutionally trained not to get canceled,\" she said. \"A lot of these people really trust me. I think it's a wonderful component that I come in from the industry.\"\n\nHer podcast's name, Sourcery, references \"sourcing deals,\" but it better represents O'Shea's talent herself. She's clearly sourced up, sporting an ever-growing rolodex of tech's biggest names.\n\nAfter buzzy interviews with Palantir CEO Alex Karp and Anduril cofounder Palmer Luckey, O'Shea's platform has quickly grown. So have her critics, some of whom say she should ask tougher questions.\n\nBut her core audience — investors in the world of tech and finance — seem to love that she's in the know.\n\nO'Shea considers herself the first of her family to chase a \"capitalistic pursuit.\"\n\n\"It's funny, there's not many business-oriented people in my family,\" she said. \"My dad had a marketing agency for most of my life, but again, it was a marketing agency. My mom is a home designer and she used to be a creative director.\"\n\nShe went to New York University for studio art but pivoted to entrepreneurship after learning how low the average artist's salary was. Eventually, she narrowed in on venture capital.\n\nO'Shea got her start working for the father of a college friend, a secondaries investor for a family office. She moved to Miami to work for him before coming back to New York as an analyst at the Global Public Offering Fund.\n\nShe then went to the seed and Series A investment firm TMV — then called Trail Mix Ventures — as an associate. She started Sourcery there as an in-house newsletter, but only made it public when she started at New York Life Ventures as a senior associate. She shared it with friends, and it eventually grew a readership.\n\nThen Upfront Ventures' Greg Bettinelli reached out with a job offer.\n\n\"I was a reader of her email newsletter,\" Bettinelli later wrote when asked about the offer. \"We were looking to hire a new investor for Upfront Ventures and I reached out as I appreciated what she built as what I think was a side project at the time.\"\n\nO'Shea said she was on a boat in the Mediterranean when she got Bettinelli's offer. She met him in the Hamptons. \"It's like the bougiest story ever,\" she said.\n\nO'Shea moved to Los Angeles for Upfront Ventures. She's stayed in the city and prefers it to New York. \"You get so much more for your money,\" she said. \"I have a hot tub!\"\n\nThen Elon Musk took over X, partially open-sourced the algorithm, and launched ad-revenue share programs. O'Shea said, \"Game on.\"\n\nShe started posting more, and her follower count grew. Erik Torenberg of the podcast network Turpentine asked if she wanted to start a podcast about deals, linked to her newsletter.\n\nWhile O'Shea declined to disclose exactly how much she earns, she said the Sourcery newsletter began generating revenue when it added subscriptions. That includes a $600 \"I can expense it\" annual tier she said \"plenty of people\" were willing to pay for.\n\nSourcery is now her full-time job and a top-200 podcast in Apple Podcasts' investing category. She employs a \"lean team\" to help her film, edit, and promote.\n\nThe Palantir and Anduril interviews helped generate more interview interest. (Her next guest: Jake Paul.)\n\nAfter an \"insane\" end to 2025, O'Shea said she spent January locked-in and focused on laying the foundation for the rest of the new year.\n\nO'Shea's network is big, and her show keeps making it bigger.\n\nAndreessen Horowitz's Alex Immerman told her he watched her Kalshi video before investing in the company, she said. \"I know plenty of people — I won't name them — that have put millions of dollars into these companies that I've profiled,\" she said.\n\nThat seems to be how O'Shea lands many of her guests: knowing the right people. I spoke to two early interviewees. Oden Technologies cofounder Willem Sundblad was introduced to O'Shea through an investor. Contrary general partner Kyle Harrison met her in 2018 and once considered hiring her while at Coatue Management.\n\n\"A lot of these relationships start first as friendships,\" Harrison said. \"We've enjoyed talking to each other off the record, so talking on the record is just as much fun.\"\n\nThe Karp interview was a right-place, right-time situation. She was at the Hill and Valley Forum in 2025, where Karp was speaking. O'Shea said Palantir's Eliano Younes recognized her from Pirate Wires and introduced her to Shyam Sankar, the company's CTO.\n\nThen she published a list of her 100 dream guests. Listed No. 1 was Ivanka Trump. Palantir staff noticed Karp wasn't on the list, O'Shea said, and she amended it, making him 1B. That set the interview in motion.\n\nHer Anduril series also sprang from the Sourcery 100 list. She put Anduril cofounders Palmer Luckey and Trae Stephens on the list. Matt Grimm commented and helped her set up an interview.\n\nThe Karp interview was her biggest by far. The full-length podcast has 4.3 million views on X — and that's not including the various clips she publishes separately.\n\nIt also made her confront the challenges of being on camera.\n\nShe published the video on a Tuesday in the back of a taxi in London. She went offline on Wednesday and woke up to hundreds of texts on Thursday asking if she was OK.\n\nIn the interview, O'Shea wore an Alaïa dress her friend had lent her. She said she liked being able to \"show some femininity and personal style.\" Some X users mocked her attire. (Others pointed out that Karp was wearing a t-shirt.)\n\nO'Shea said she was glad to be offline at the time and not glued to her phone watching the comments, and grateful for the women who reached out.\n\n\"There were a lot of really horrible tweets, and a lot of really disgusting things that I wish I did not see,\" she said. \"The internet is a scary place.\"\n\nIn November, The Guardian published a feature about the \"friendly media bubble\" that turns CEO interview subjects into stars. O'Shea was the lead anecdote. The piece closed with her asking Karp what type of cupcake he would want to be.\n\nO'Shea knows that some people want her to ask \"harder questions.\" Her response: \"If you want to have criticism of a company, how about do some research on it.\"\n\nThat doesn't mean she won't ask the kind of in-the-weeds technical question about deal structure or strategy that you'd expect from someone with VC roots. The conversations can also veer off of investment talk.\n\nTake a recent interview with the lightning rod venture capitalist Shaun Maguire of Sequoia — who generated widespread backlash after saying Zohran Mamdani was a secret \"Islamist\" who \"comes from a culture of lying.\" At one point, she's asking him about the economics of telecommunications. At another, Maguire is calling Mamdani a communist and a terrorist-supporter.\n\nO'Shea maintains that hard questions aren't the purpose of her podcast. She'll sprinkle one in every so often, she said, but the goal is mostly to be a resource. Sourcery is a place for investors to get information about a subject's views — don't expect O'Shea to dig in on a guest's recent scandal or push back on a controversial position.\n\n\"If you want to know about lawsuits, I don't know, go read lawsuits,\" she said.\n\nO'Shea is clearly proud of her work. She described a recent nap, dozing off to the \"All-In\" podcast. She woke up to a new podcast on, and thought: \"Holy crap, what is this amazing interview?\" It was her own.\n\nEnding our call, I asked if she had a media analogy for herself. TBPN is often called the \"SportsCenter of Silicon Valley.\" What is Sourcery?\n\nShe waffled back and forth; maybe she's \"30 for 30,\" maybe she's Martha Stewart.\n\nLater that day, she emailed me her answer: Barbara Walters, who, incidentally, was famous for her hard-hitting questions.\n\n\"Absolute legend,\" O'Shea wrote.",

    "title": "Salesforce exec shares the advice he gives entry-level talent: 'Hard isn't necessarily bad.'",
    "description": "Salesforce's senior VP of business technology said he tries to teach his kids resilience, and it's a skill is important for entry-level talent, too.",
    "fullText": "As companies rethink how they train early-career workers in a job market shaped by AI, Salesforce executive Andy White said resilience is top of mind for him — both at work and at home.\n\nWhite oversees Salesforce's implementation of Slackbot, an AI personal agent that generates responses based on conversations, files, and workflows inside Slack.\n\nAs White raises his son and daughter during a period of rapid technological change, he said he preaches to his kids the importance of powering through moments that don't go as planned. He said resilience is pivotal and that it's important for people to focus on doing the hard things and being OK when things don't go as expected.\n\nThe senior vice president of business technology said he recently spoke with his daughter about the importance of dealing with situations rather than merely labeling them as \"good\" or \"bad.\"\n\n\"Hard is hard,\" White told Business Insider. \"Hard isn't necessarily bad.\"\n\nExpectations, he said, are the \"destroyer of hope and joy,\" and that when things don't go as planned, it often turns out to be a good thing down the line, even if it doesn't seem that way in the moment.\n\n\"It's when we look back, and it's like, 'Oh man, I'm glad that didn't go the way I expected,'\" White said. \"But when you're in it, it's really hard.\"\n\nThe resilience lesson is one White also thinks is relevant for entry-level workers. While junior hires often arrive ready to use new tools and deliver a \"pretty high output,\" he said, persistence is an area where some still need to grow.\n\nHe described today's entry-level talent pool as \"incredibly capable, very bright, and very driven,\" with a stronger grasp of how to use AI tools to solve problems.\n\n\"They're much more fluent at being able to leverage AI tooling in the flow of their work,\" White said.\n\nHowever, he said the group sometimes struggles when it comes to working through challenges.\n\n\"There's more willingness to give up sooner,\" he said, adding that this trait doesn't apply across the board.\n\nWhite said he's seen AI tools, such as the company's recently upgraded Slackbot, help boost entry-level workers' confidence. He said they could help reduce feelings of imposter syndrome by helping early-career workers navigate challenging situations that arise at work.\n\nWith that said, White added that workers need to stay balanced and not let tools make them \"overly confident.\" He said workers need to bring skepticism to \"any kind of information\" they get, and be diligent about reviewing sources and citations when using AI.\n\n\"If you don't believe something, read the citation, and if it doesn't have a citation, you have to assume it's a hallucination,\" White said, adding that he tells his kids the same thing.",

    "description": "Two C-suite executives and several senior staff have recently departed Tools for Humanity, Sam Altman's eye-scanning Orb startup.",
    "fullText": "Two C-suite executives and several senior staff have departed Tools for Humanity, the Sam Altman-founded startup behind the eyeball-scanning \"Orb,\" in recent months, Business Insider has learned.\n\nAdrian Ludwig, the Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Architect, recently left after a two-year stint, according to two people and a LinkedIn review. He previously worked at firms including Alphabet, Atlassian, and Adobe.\n\nDamien Kieran, Chief Legal and Privacy Officer for the past year and a half also recently announced his departure in a LinkedIn post. His previous roles included general counsel at the photo-sharing app BeReal and chief privacy officer at Twitter, leaving after Elon Musk took over the platform. His hiring at the Altman startup was widely covered in the summer of 2024.\n\nKieran said in the post that he plans to spend his time off training for an Ironman, earning his pilot's license, and riding his motorcycles.\n\nLudwig and Kieran declined requests for comment.\n\nTheir exits follow a slew of other high-level departures: the head of protocol and applied research, the head of people, the head of talent, and the head of people operations have left the company in recent months, according to former employees and a review of LinkedIn. A former employee added that the company's data protection officer left in November. The head of device product and a lawyer who, according to LinkedIn, joined in September, also submitted their notices, this person said.\n\nBusiness Insider reviewed an internal Slack message in the company's #team-chat channel in which CEO Alex Blania described leadership changes, including the appointment of five interim positions. That included an interim head of market operations, interim head of operational partnerships, interim head of people, interim general counsel, and interim head of protocol.\n\n\"Only exceptional impact, commitment, extreme work ethic, and mission alignment will be sufficient to succeed in our team,\" Blania wrote. \"If that's not for you, that is okay. But in fairness to all other team members, this might not be the right place to be.\"\n\nOne former employee who recently left the company said that challenges with company culture and leadership contributed to the departures.\n\nA Tools for Humanity spokesperson told Business Insider that, \"each departure is unique and we wish our former colleagues the best.\"\n\n\"At a time when the distinction between AI and humans online blurs more each day, we've aligned our team around our increasingly urgent mission to help humanity make those distinctions,\" she said.\n\nThe rash of exits at Tools for Humanity comes as Altman and Blania turn their attention to a new venture they co-founded, Merge Labs, to develop brain-computer interfaces.\n\nAs Business Insider previously reported, Tools for Humanity has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to try and scan the world's eyeballs in order to verify users' identities. Along the way, it's struggled to win over international regulators, and former employees expressed concern over its long-term strategy.\n\nThe company has also faced scrutiny over its hardcore company culture, after Business Insider reported that Blania told staffers to work weekends and not care about anything outside of work.\n\nDo you work for Tools for Humanity or have a tip?

    "description": "Livingston Mall, now a veritable ghost town, was once a big player in North Jersey retail. But a maelstrom of events sucked the life out of it.",
    "fullText": "Google the phrase “dead malls in New Jersey” and you’ll be hit with a few contenders — but a standout in North Jersey is Livingston Mall.\n\nWith the Macy’s anchor store closing sometime in 2026, and Barnes & Noble expected to leave sometime in 2027, Livingston Mall is on its last breaths.\n\nIt opened on Eisenhower Parkway in western Essex County in 1972 as downtowns and urban centers became hollowed out and the dominant spenders moved to the suburbs.\n\nMalls are not necessarily dead — data from ICSC, a worldwide commercial real estate trade association, showed that during this past holiday season, 72% of shoppers bought something at a suburban shopping center or mall.\n\nBut analysts interviewed by NorthJersey.com all agreed that Livingston Mall is a \"dead mall.\"\n\nIn its heyday, the two-story center had three major department stores and 108 small specialty stores, historical documents show. They included Lord & Taylor, Sears, KB Toys, Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works.\n\nLivingston — with Route 280 running through it — “was readily accessible to both Newark and New York by a major transportation artery,” Charles DeMarco Jr., a local historian, has written. The completion of Eisenhower Parkway between Route 10 and Roseland only bolstered customer traffic.\n\nWith cities and suburban downtowns struggling at the time, and online shopping still decades away, suburban malls were the dominant centers of culture and commerce.\n\n“People would spend their Saturday afternoons and Sunday afternoons strolling the mall, looking at new goods, figuring out what’s fashionable and the like,” said James Hughes, a professor of urban planning and policy development at Rutgers University in New Brunswick.\n\nBut everything that could go wrong for a mall managed to hit Livingston Mall.\n\nBig-box stores such as Target and Walmart rose, siphoning away dollars.\n\nAnd Livingston Mall faced intense competition from just 4 miles away in The Mall at Short Hills, a luxury shopping center that had opened in its enclosed format in 1980.\n\nThen online shopping rolled out in force around 2007 and 2008, Hughes said.\n\nUrban centers like Newark and Jersey City, as well as downtowns like Ridgewood and Westfield, rebounded in the past decade and drew back dollars that had gone to malls, Hughes said.\n\nBut then the COVID-19 pandemic decimated customer traffic.\n\nLuis Castillo, a general manager at the mall's Popeyes restaurant, started working at Livingston Mall in 2017. Cinnabon shuttered within the next couple of years, but its closure hardly seemed ominous to the other tenants.\n\nThe shopping center remained bustling until the COVID pandemic hit the area and a state-mandated lockdown forced store owners to close up shop temporarily, Castillo said. At least they thought it would be temporary.\n\nWhen the mall reopened, many of the business owners couldn’t afford to return. They had spent what little money they had left to cover back rent through the six-month closure at the landlord’s insistence, Castillo said.\n\nOne store after another shuttered.\n\n“We never thought it would go down so fast,” Castillo said. It didn’t take long for much of the central corridor to become vacant. The only available light came through the mall’s atrium. The place was dark, literally and figuratively.\n\n“Sort of the perfect storm hit,” Hughes said of Livingston Mall.\n\nSears closed in April 2020 and Lord & Taylor in August that year. Developers of the nearby Livingston Shopping Center announced this January that the Barnes & Noble store would be moving out of Livingston Mall property and going less than 2 miles down the road to the shopping center.\n\nMost recently, Macy’s announced in early January that it would close its location at Livingston Mall later in the year.\n\nLivingston Mall had been owned by Simon Property Group, one of the largest mall owners in the U.S. In November 2025 it acquired the remaining stake of Taubman Realty Group, which operates luxury malls across the U.S., including The Mall at Short Hills. That acquisition process by Simon Property Group started in 2020.\n\n“From that point forward, it was clear that Simon was no longer committed to the success of the Livingston Mall, and the neglect of the property was immediate,” Livingston Township Manager Barry Lewis told NorthJersey.com in an email.\n\nKohan Retail Investment Group — which bought the mall in 2022 — “has a very poor track record in owning and managing malls, even being referred to in one article as a ‘mall scavenger,’” Lewis continued.\n\n“As soon as Kohan bought the property, the decline accelerated and the conditions at the Livingston Mall quickly deteriorated and have continued to do so,” Lewis said.\n\nRepresentatives for Kohan did not return multiple emails seeking comment or requesting an interview.\n\nLivingston Mall’s days as an enclosed shopping center are over, argued Charles Cristella, who studies retail and malls for Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate adviser.\n\n“You cannot bring it back as a traditional mall,” he said in an interview.\n\nLast year, the township designated Livingston Mall as an “area in need of redevelopment” and drew up potential plans for what could go at the site.\n\n“The town — if it’s a redevelopment area — is in the driver's seat,” said Hughes, of Rutgers. “They could acquire the land and totally control it.”\n\nLewis said the township could potentially acquire the land through eminent domain.\n\nThere are several competing interests at the moment, Lewis said. Kohan owns 30 acres of land, and Macy’s is looking to buy 10 acres. Hudson Bay Company — the owner of Lord & Taylor — has a 99-year lease on 10 acres. Transformco, which acquired some former Sears assets, owns 16 acres.\n\n“If private developers are unable to successfully negotiate and acquire control of the mall on reasonable terms, the township is prepared to exercise its power of eminent domain to acquire the property in partnership with one or more redevelopers,” Lewis said.\n\nWhat would go there remains up in the air. The township of Livingston has an affordable housing obligation of 376 housing units through apartments and townhouses, and the mall site has been eyed as a candidate for where the housing could be built.\n\nThere’s also the possibility of a “broad mix of uses that may include retail, dining and entertainment, experiential, recreation, public amenities, hotel, medical or other office and other possible uses,” Lewis said.\n\nFor comparison, a redevelopment project adjacent to Garden State Plaza in Paramus is underway and will include as many as 1,400 apartments, along with additional shops, a hotel, a senior care facility and a park-like “town green.”\n\n“There is no other property almost anywhere of this size in such a prime location that holds such promise,” Livingston Mayor Shawn Klein said in an email.\n\nOn a snowy Wednesday in early February, Livingston Mall loomed over an empty, decaying parking lot pocked with potholes. Some of the lot was blanketed in unplowed, pristine snow left over from a storm that passed over the region over a week earlier.\n\nThe mall's decay is apparent to the few employees who still work there.\n\nJim Testa, an optician at LensCrafters, knows a secret trick for navigating the blacktop’s treacherous terrain: “To get out of here you just kind of hug the building until you pass Macy’s. Then you steer outward. But there’s one more crater after that.”\n\nOver the past year, JCP&L — the local electric company — cut power to the building twice during business hours because the landlord hadn’t paid the mall’s utility bills, Testa said.\n\nThe food court sinks were long out of service. In the summer, there was no air conditioning.\n\nWhen rain dripped down through the ceiling, the owners of Hidden Treasures, a collectibles and antiques store, called the fire department. No one at the investment group has answered the phone in three years, said David McMorrow of Hidden Treasures.\n\nTesta calls the municipality when emergent circumstances arise. The Popeyes staff has learned to fix issues themselves.\n\nNow, amid the arctic blasts bringing in bitter cold from the north for days on end, LensCrafters employees said they have used their own space heater to keep the office habitable.\n\n\"It's uncomfortable,\" said Castillo, the general manager at Popeyes. \"All my employees wear coats.\"\n\nHis assessment was blunt: “There is no management.”\n\n(This story was updated because an earlier version included an inaccuracy.)\n\nDaniel Munoz covers business, consumer affairs, labor and the economy for NorthJersey.com and The Record.\n\nEmail: munozd@northjersey.com; Twitter:@danielmunoz100, Facebook and Instagram\n\nThis article originally appeared on NorthJersey.com: Zombie mall is dying in North Jersey, hit by 'perfect storm'",

    "fullText": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) — The United Nations said Monday it’s waiting to find out how much of the nearly $4 billion the United States owes the world organization the Trump administration intends to pay and when the money will arrive.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres warned last week that the world body faces “imminent financial collapse” unless its financial rules are overhauled or all 193 member nations pay their dues, a message clearly directed at the United States.\n\nThe U.S. owes $2.196 billion to the U.N.’s regular operating budget, including $767 million for this year, according to a U.N. official. The U.S. also owes $1.8 billion for the separate budget for the U.N.’s far-flung peacekeeping operations, and that also will rise.\n\nThe U.S. Mission to the United Nations confirmed that U.S. Ambassador Mike Waltz said the Trump administration planned to make a significant down payment on its arrears in a matter of weeks, with the final amount still to be determined. His comments were first reported by Reuters.\n\nU.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters Monday that Guterres has been in touch with Waltz “for quite some time,” and the U.N.’s controller also has been in touch with U.S. officials.\n\n”We’re waiting to see exactly when payments will be made and in what amount,” Dujarric said.\n\nGuterres said in a letter to all member nations last week that cash for the U.N.'s regular operating budget could run out by July, which could dramatically affect its operations.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said the United Nations has not lived up to its potential. His administration did not pay anything to the United Nations in 2025, and it has withdrawn from U.N. organizations, including the World Health Organization and the cultural agency UNESCO, while pulling funding from dozens of others.\n\nU.N. officials have said 95% of the arrears to the U.N.’s regular budget is from the United States.\n\nThe country second on the list for not paying its mandatory regular dues is Venezuela, which owes $38 million, the U.N. official said. The South American nation, whose economy was struggling before the U.S. military raid in January that deposed then-President Nicolás Maduro, has lost its right to vote in the General Assembly for being two years in arrears.\n\nNearly 60 countries paid their annual dues by the Feb. 8 due date.",

    "description": "Think GPS runs the world? China's BeiDou is a fast-rising rival with military and disaster uses, plus a rapidly expanding satellite and ground network.",
    "fullText": "The term \"GPS\" has become ubiquitous in American life. You know it as the foundational technology of navigation apps like Google Maps and Waze, but in most of the world, GPS is just a meaningless trio of letters. The Global Positioning System is owned and operated by the U.S. military, and it is just one of many Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in operation around the world. In the European Union, people find their way with help from a GNSS called Galileo. In Russia, they use GLONASS (GLObal NAvigation Satellite System). Japan has QZSS (Quasi-Zenith Satellite System), commonly known as Michibiki. But there's one system that matters more than people realize: China's BeiDou isn't just a GPS alternative, it's a fast-growing platform with uses that go far beyond navigation.\n\nThe first BeiDou satellites launched in 2000, and by 2020, it had achieved global coverage. Just like America's GPS, BeiDou is owned and operated by its home government, and the ruling Chinese Communist Party has kept most of its technological specifications secret. However, BeiDou has caught the attention of other governments, particularly the United States, due to its wide-ranging uses. BeiDou does a lot more than guide people on their way to work. Just as GPS is closely tied into the American military, BeiDou is becoming ingrained in China's military operations, used by guided missiles and bombs. It's also being used for monitoring and responding to natural disasters. BeiDou is already more advanced than GPS in many ways, and it's grown at a stunning pace.\n\nBeiDou is much younger than GPS, which first launched in 1978 and achieved full coverage in 1993. However, the Chinese government has pursued progress on its GNSS much more aggressively than the United States. BeiDou was born with a competitive spirit, as part of a push to bolster China's military wing, the People's Liberation Army, at the end of the last century.\n\nA defining moment for China's GNSS ambitions came amidst the 1996 Taiwan Strait missile crisis, when tensions between the Chinese and Taiwanese governments led to the PLA conducting a series of missile tests in the East China Sea. During one of the tests, the Chinese missiles missed their targets badly. They had been relying on a GPS signal that went out, and Chinese officials later suggested the signal had been disrupted. The CCP resolved at that moment to develop a GNSS independent of, and superior to, the Americans'. From the beginning, national defense, and particularly missile guidance, was at the forefront of BeiDou.\n\nSince the 2010s, BeiDou has played a major role in China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a massive infrastructure project aimed at expanding trade routes across the Eastern Hemisphere. In the process, China has begun heavily promoting BeiDou on the international scale. Their partnership with the military of Pakistan in 2018 drew particular attention. Amidst a steady air of tension between Beijing and Washington, China's ability to fortify its allies' militaries will have immense geopolitical consequences in any form of conflict.\n\nMeanwhile, the United States has been steadily rolling out GPS III. It will be an upgrade over the currently available GPS system, but it will probably still fall short of BeiDou on most fronts. GPS III will add more satellites to the GPS constellation, but the new satellites are only an incremental upgrade over what's already in use. In fact, GPS III was originally intended to launch in 2014, so the system is already outdated in some ways — and the first satellites for its planned successor, GPS IIIF, aren't scheduled to launch until Spring 2027.\n\nBeiDou has raised alarms within the U.S. government amidst a tight competition with Beijing for tech superiority that has already shown the Chinese can outmatch our drone technology. Perhaps the most concerning comment about BeiDou came from within the U.S. government itself, in a memo from former Coast Guard Admiral Thad Allen from 2023, which plainly said, \"GPS's capabilities are now substantially inferior to those of China's BeiDou.\"\n\nEnjoyed this article?",

    "description": "Democratic leaders say a proposal from the White House is “incomplete and insufficient” as they are demanding new restrictions on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and threatening a shutd...",
    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — Democratic leaders say a proposal from the White House is “incomplete and insufficient” as they are demanding new restrictions on President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown and threatening a shutdown of the Homeland Security Department.\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a statement late Monday that a White House counterproposal to the list of demands they transmitted over the weekend “included neither details nor legislative text” and does not address “the concerns Americans have about ICE’s lawless conduct.” The White House proposal was not released publicly.\n\nThe Democrats’ statement comes as time is running short, with another partial government shutdown threatening to begin Saturday. Among the Democrats’ demands are a requirement for judicial warrants, better identification of DHS officers, new use-of-force standards and a stop to racial profiling. They say such changes are necessary after two protesters were fatally shot by federal agents in Minneapolis last month.\n\nEarlier Monday, Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., had expressed optimism about the rare negotiations between Democrats and the White House, saying there was “forward progress.”\n\nThune said it was a good sign that the two sides were trading papers, and “hopefully they can find some common ground here.”\n\nBut coming to an agreement on the charged issue of immigration enforcement will be difficult, especially as rank-and-file lawmakers in both parties were skeptical about finding common ground.\n\nRepublicans have balked at the Democrats’ requests and some have demands of their own, including the addition of legislation that would require proof of citizenship before Americans register to vote and restrictions on cities that they say do not do enough to crack down on illegal immigration.\n\nAnd many Democrats who are furious about Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s aggressive crackdown have said they won’t vote for another penny of Homeland Security funding until enforcement is radically scaled back.\n\n“Dramatic changes are needed at the Department of Homeland Security before a DHS funding bill moves forward,” Jeffries said earlier Monday. “Period. Full stop.”\n\nCongress is trying to renegotiate the DHS spending bill after Trump agreed to a Democratic request that it be separated out from a larger spending measure that became law last week. That package extended Homeland Security funding at current levels only through Feb. 13, creating a brief window for action as the two parties discuss new restrictions on ICE and other federal officers.\n\nDemocrats made the demands for new restrictions on ICE and other federal law enforcement after ICU nurse Alex Pretti was shot and killed by a U.S. Border Patrol officer in Minneapolis on Jan. 24, and some Republicans suggested that new restrictions were necessary. Renee Good was shot by ICE agents on Jan. 7.\n\nWhile he agreed to separate the funding, Trump has not publicly responded to the Democrats’ specific demands.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said late last week that the Trump administration is willing to discuss some items on the Democrats’ list, but “others don’t seem like they are grounded in any common sense, and they are nonstarters for this administration.”\n\nSchumer and Jeffries have said they want immigration officers to remove their masks, to show identification and to better coordinate with local authorities. They have also demanded a stricter use-of-force policy for the federal officers, legal safeguards at detention centers and a prohibition on tracking protesters with body-worn cameras.\n\nAmong other demands, Democrats say Congress should end indiscriminate arrests, “improve warrant procedures and standards,” ensure the law is clear that officers cannot enter private property without a judicial warrant and require that before a person can be detained, it’s verified that the person is not a U.S. citizen.\n\nRepublicans have said they support the requirement for DHS officers to have body-worn cameras — language that was in the original DHS bill — but have balked at many of the other Democratic asks.\n\n“Taking the masks off ICE officers and agents, the reason we can’t do that is that it would subject them to great harm, their families at great risk because people are doxing them and targeting them,” said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., on Monday. “We’ve got to talk about things that are reasonable and achievable.”\n\nTennessee Sen. Bill Hagerty said on “Fox News Sunday” that Democrats are ”trying to motivate a radical left base.”\n\n“The left has gone completely overboard, and they’re threatening the safety and security of our agents so they cannot do their job,” Hagerty said.\n\nIn addition to ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, the homeland security bill includes funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Transportation Security Administration. If DHS shuts down, Thune said last week, “there’s a very good chance we could see more travel problems” similar to the 43-day government closure last year.\n\nLawmakers in both parties have suggested they could separate out funding for ICE and Border Patrol and pass the rest of it by Friday. But Thune has been cool to that idea, saying instead that Congress should pass another short-term extension for all of DHS while they negotiate the possible new restrictions.\n\n“If there’s additional time that’s needed, then hopefully Democrats would be amenable to another extension,” Thune said.\n\nMany Democrats are unlikely to vote for another extension. But Republicans could potentially win enough votes in both chambers from Democrats if they feel hopeful about negotiations.\n\n“The ball is in the Republicans’ court,” Jeffries said Monday.",

To Gwalia United's Anna Powell, he was the grandfather in Wales who used to play rugby.\n\nPowell was born and raised in Australia but has moved \"home\" to Wales as she bids to live her dream of playing football in the Women's Super League (WSL).\n\nThe 20-year-old listened to tales of John's rugby exploits while growing up in Fremantle, Perth.\n\nBut having crossed the globe to join Gwalia last month, Powell is \"learning things each day\" about John, the former Wales fly-half who died in 2024 and will be long remembered as one of the greatest players his sport has seen.\n\n\"My mum would tell us stories about him. When we were young we'd be like 'yeah, OK, that seems pretty cool',\" Powell said.\n\n\"But over here, I have been blown away by the legacy he has. It's almost like he is still with us in a way because his name continues to be brought up.\n\n\"I was saying to mum, 'I am shocked'. She said 'I told you so' and I said 'yeah, you were right!'.\"\n\nPowell's parents are Lucy - one of John's four children - and Meirion, from Caerphilly, who left Wales for Australia in 2003.\n\nThe family would return to these shores to visit their many relatives, with Powell remembering how \"dadcu\" - Welsh for grandfather - \"didn't stress about anything\".\n\n\"I have many memories with him,\" Powell said. \"But the memories I have are not of the rugby legend Barry John. He was dadcu to all of us.\n\n\"He would throw sweets at us in his flat overlooking Llandaff fields. He would tell stories. He was so calm and relaxed and funny.\"\n\nWhen Powell was tasked with doing a school project on a family member, John was the obvious choice.\n\nAs a result she rang him for information on his legendary career in which he played for Llanelli, Cardiff, Wales and the British and Irish Lions.\n\n\"He was so animated - he would bring up the matches and I could visualise everything. He was such a great storyteller,\" she said.\n\n\"You could tell he had so much pride for Wales. But he wouldn't say 'I did this, I was so amazing', he praised everyone.\n\n\"He said [Sir] Gareth [Edwards] and JPR [Williams] were great players to play with. He would talk about the joy of playing as opposed to what he did.\"\n\nThe idea of trying rugby was discussed at one stage, but Powell has been a football fanatic since joining her local club, Fremantle City, about a decade ago.\n\nShe spent two years playing at college in Texas before the move to Britain, which came about thanks in part to the family's rugby connections.\n\nPowell's great uncle is Derek Quinnell, John's brother-in-law and former team-mate. Quinnell's sons, former Wales players Scott and Craig, are Powell's first cousins once removed.\n\nWith Powell keen to play football in Wales, Craig got in touch with Trystan Bevan, the former Cardiff Blues head of performance who is now the general manager at Gwalia.\n\nWithin days, Powell had agreed a deal running until the end of the season with the option of another year.\n\nShe is living with her grandmother, John's widow Janet, and uncle as she looks to establish herself in the National League Southern Premier Division, the third tier of the English football pyramid.\n\nThe rugby genius they simply called 'The King'\n\nCardiff City Ladies to be renamed Gwalia United\n\n\"I feel so grateful and blessed to be over here, to enjoy all of Wales and to be with my extended family in my original home, I guess [you could call it],\" Powell said.\n\nAcademic studies have been put on hold as Powell, a midfielder or forward, focuses on \"working hard for Gwalia\".\n\nHer ultimate goals are to reach the WSL, the English top flight, and to play international football.\n\nBut would Powell play for Australia or Wales, should the chance come?\n\n\"I love my country back home but I also love Wales and the fact that I am Welsh,\" she said.\n\n\"Whether I had a famous granddad who played rugby or not, it's the people and the life and the history of Wales. It's so wonderful to know that I'm a part of that.\n\n\"Whether it is Australia or Wales, anything would be such an amazing opportunity.\"\n\nBen Haines, Ellen White and Jen Beattie are back for another season of the Women's Football Weekly podcast.

    "fullText": "Ask any eight-year-old in the world and there is a high chance that they would bite your arm off to go and see Mickey Mouse at Walt Disney World.\n\nAsk Ffion Tynan and the answer would be very different.\n\nThe Welsh golfer was on a family holiday in 2012 when she politely declined a visit to one of the parks in Orlando, instead opting for the kids' holiday club activity of the day.\n\nIt turned out she was actually pretty good at the sport, with a fire lit inside her that day.\n\nFast forward to 2026 and Tynan, 22, has turned professional after earning her spot on the Ladies European Tour (LET) through qualifying school in Morocco.\n\n\"I have a younger sister, who's two and a half years younger than me,\" said Tynan.\n\n\"She wanted to go back to one of the Disney parks and I wasn't having it. I was stubborn and I said to my friends I'm not going, so I ended up doing the kids camp for the day.\n\n\"The coach asked me to stay behind and I was like 'Oh no, am I in trouble?'. They spoke to my parents and said I had a talent for it and to keep playing.\n\n\"My dad just laughed because I was the little girl in gymnastics in pretty flowery stuff and I was going to play this sport none of my family grew up in. From there my sister followed.\"\n\nTynan laughs as she reflects fondly on the day.\n\n\"I don't know what I was thinking,\" she told BBC Sport Wales.\n\n\"I don't know if [turning pro] would have happened had I not been a stubborn eight-year-old, so here I am now.\"\n\nHarry targets LPGA Tour after 'dream' debut season\n\nWelsh golfers Thompson and Tynan secure LET chance\n\nEver since Tynan's love of golf was realised, family holidays have revolved around the sport.\n\n\"Up until 2021, we didn't go on a holiday that didn't include golf,\" Tynan explained.\n\n\"I was very fortunate that we'd tie stuff in. So for example there's a small swing of events in Florida at Christmas time, so we'd go out there, do the Christmas bits, play the events and then go to Disney World one day or my favourite, Discovery Cove.\n\n\"We kind of had a family holiday within a golf competition, which was really nice.\"\n\nHer golfing passion saw her take her education to the United States too, first at the University of Arkansas and then the University of Missouri.\n\n\"I was always one of the youngest ones in the bigger tournaments,\" said Tynan.\n\n\"I looked up to some of the older people and I saw some of them go over there [to America] and it sounded pretty cool.\n\n\"My mum's a teacher so I was definitely getting a degree. To be able to do both [play golf and study] on a scholarship and coming back without student debt, that's great.\n\n\"It was such a cool experience and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to go.\n\n\"I was 17 when I went so quite young but I had the best time, met some of my best friends. It was a really cool experience.\"\n\nTynan says she has been influenced in her career by tennis legend and seven-time singles Grand Slam winner Venus Williams.\n\nHer golfing hero is Charley Hull, who was named the Ladies European Tour (LET) rookie of the year in 2013, shortly after Tynan's love affair with the sport began.\n\n\"I used to run around on the course and watch her play and try to swing it like her and that kind of stuff,\" Tynan added.\n\n\"I remember when I was a kid my coach would always say, 'You've got to hold your finish like Charley'. I would try to do that when I was a kid.\n\n\"It's pretty cool to see her still around after influencing me at a young age. That's what I want, to be a person that can influence the next generation, and if I get some of the accolades she gets that's incredible.\n\n\"I want to give back as well and show a little girl from a small town in Wales can do it as well.\"\n\nAsked whether she had got in contact with her hero, Tynan gave a smile.\n\n\"I feel like it's that big line at the moment [between peer and hero],\" Tynan said.\n\n\"Maybe I'll get lucky enough and play in a major and play with her - that would be pretty awesome.\n\n\"I'm not going to reach out to her yet but I'm hoping to at least meet her in a tournament. That would be pretty cool.\"\n\nThe 2026 LET season begins in Saudi Arabia this week, but Tynan will not be in the field because her playing rights will only grant access to certain event.\n\nAs it stands, she is waiting to discover when exactly her tour debut will come.\n\nWhenever the time comes to step on to the first tee, it will be the culmination of 14 years of graft.\n\n\"I was nine years old when I decided the path I was going to take, so a long time in the making,\" said Tynan.\n\n\"I did four years in college and as soon as finishing that I went to Q-school knowing if I did well in that I was turning pro, so I'm really proud of myself for being able to accomplish that.\n\n\"There's not a lot of people able to do that, so I'm very grateful that I have and I'm just really proud of myself for the little girl inside who's screaming about it and really excited to get started.\"",

    "fullText": "A turkey butcher who cut her girlfriend in half with a kitchen knife and buried her in a garden has been found guilty of murder.\n\nAnna Podedworna, 40, killed Izabela Zablocka before trussing her up “like a chicken” with electrical tape. She then buried her remains in bin bags in a “filthy, makeshift grave”.\n\nDerby Crown Court heard that Zablocka, a 30-year-old mother of one, lost contact with her family in August 2010 and was reported to the police as missing.\n\nProsecutor Gordon Aspden KC said that “mounting pressure” caused Podedworna to “crack” and email the police in 2025 when a Polish TV journalist flew to the UK to interview her.\n\nIn June, officers found Zablocka’s remains under concrete hardstanding in the garden of a terraced house in Princes Street, Normanton, Derby, which she shared with Podedworna after they moved to the UK from Poland together.\n\nThe defendant will be sentenced at the same court on Wednesday. Jurors unanimously convicted Podedworna of murder, preventing a lawful burial and perverting the course of justice.\n\nMr Aspden previously told the jury that Podedworna tried to cover up the murder with a series of “deliberate, calculated, gruesome and time-consuming acts” over several days.\n\nThe jury was told that “considerable force” would have been needed to cut Zablocka’s body in half, and that her legs had been bound together before she was buried.\n\nThe prosecutor said Podedworna was a skilled butcher at a poultry factory called Cranberry Foods in Scropton, Derbyshire, at the time she killed Zablocka.\n\nMr Aspden had told the court: “Her work had involved skinning, deboning, and portioning out turkey carcasses using a large knife.”\n\nEmployment records at the Cranberry Foods factory show that Podedworna took two weeks off work after Zablocka made final contact with her mother.\n\nGiving evidence with the help of a Polish interpreter, the defendant said Zablocka was “angry” on the day of her death, before she grabbed Podedworna and began strangling her.\n\nPodedworna told jurors she was acting in self-defence when she hit Zablocka with a horse figurine, and had believed her partner was going to kill her.\n\nInstead of calling for an ambulance when she could not find a pulse, the court heard that Podedworna decided to cut Zablocka in half with a knife and bury her in the garden.\n\nShe had told jurors: “I was just terrified, I felt fear. I thought I will bury her. I took the decision I would bury her in the garden. I wanted to pick her up whole. I just did not have the strength to pick her up. I had an idea to cut her down. It seemed the only way… to cut her into two.”\n\nSamantha Shallow from the Crown Prosecution Service said: “Izabela Zablocka came to Derby in search of a new life with her partner, but instead met her death.\n\n“Anna Podedworna not only brutally murdered her partner, but she subjected Izabela’s loved ones to 15 years of uncertainty and anguish, not knowing if she was alive or dead.\n\n“Podedworna hid the truth for years, but justice has caught up with her. Her callous actions took a mother and daughter away from her family and denied them the opportunity to grieve her passing and lay her to rest. I would like to offer them my sincere sympathies.”",

    "fullText": "Secure, noise-cancelling Bluetooth earbuds that shine for exercise and everyday use on Android and iPhone\n\nApple’s revamped compact workout Beats earbuds stick to a winning formula, while slimming down and improving comfort.\n\nThe new Powerbeats Fit are the direct successors to 2022’s popular Beats Fit Pro, costing £200 (€230/$200/A$330). They sit alongside the recently redesigned Powerbeats Pro 2 as Apple’s fitness alternatives of the AirPods.\n\nThe Fit take Beats’ standard earbud design and add a flexible silicone stabiliser wing that curves around the inside of your concha, rather than around the outside of your ear like the Pro 2. The result is a far more compact and discreet earbud – particularly if you opt for a subtler colour than spark orange – and one that’s more comfortable to wear with glasses.\n\nOnce twisted into place, the earbuds stayed firmly in my ears regardless of how vigorously I shook my head or how wet I got running in the rain. The new wing is a little more comfortable for extended periods than their predecessors, but I still found it put uncomfortable pressure on the inside of my left ear after an hour or so.\n\nA single button on each earbud takes care of playback and noise cancelling controls, or can be set to adjust volume on a press and hold. Call quality is very good – particularly for earbuds without stalks – sounding relatively natural and clear even when speaking softly in quiet environments and only allowing a little background noise through on busy streets.\n\nThe battery in the earbuds lasts a good six hours of playback with noise cancelling and can be charged three times in the case for a total of 24 hours use before needing to be connected to power by USB-C.\n\nThe earbuds have Apple’s older H1 chip for managing connectivity, which means a seamless connection to the iPhone and other Apple gear with spatial audio, music sharing and Siri. But the Beats app on Android offers many of the same advanced features, including instant pairing, customisation, updates and battery widgets, making them cross-compatible and ideal for people who use both platforms.\n\nConnectivity: Bluetooth 5, SBC, AAC, H1 chip\n\nBattery life: six hours ANC playback (24 hours with case)\n\nWater resistance: buds and case IPX4 (splash resistant)\n\nEarbud dimensions: 27.4 x 21.5 x 20.4mm\n\nCharging case dimensions: 62.5 x 55.4 x 27.5mm\n\nThe Beats sound far better than your average workout buds and are good enough to be general listening earphones. They produce fairly balanced sound with plenty of powered in the low end when required, good separation of tones and decent detail in the mids and highs. They are quite similar to the Powerbeats Pro 2 and do a great job with punchier rock, pop, hip-hop or electronic tracks, but fall short of the AirPods Pro 3.\n\nUnlike most workout buds the Beats have active noise cancellation, which works pretty well to dampen the drone of road noise or the commute. It can’t handle the difficult higher tones, such as clicks, taps and background chatter as well as the Powerbeats Pro or the best-in-class AirPods Pro 3, but it does the job most of the time.\n\nThe earbuds also have a good and natural-sounding transparency mode, which helps with awareness while out running. But like the Powerbeats Pro 2 it isn’t quite as good as not having anything in your ears, so is still best used in safer environments such as parks.\n\nApple does not provide an expected lifespan for the batteries, but they should last in excess of 500 full-charge cycles with at least 80% of their original capacity.\n\nThe earbuds are not repairable but Apple will offer individual replacements for lost or damaged parts, including a £69 battery service. It does not publish environmental impact reports for accessories such as headphones. The company offers trade-in and free recycling schemes, including for non-Apple products.\n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Fit cost £199.95 (€229.95/$199.99/A$329.95).\n\nFor comparison, the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 cost £250, the Beats Studio Buds+ cost £180, the Beats Solo Buds cost £80 and the AirPods Pro 3 cost £219.\n\nThe Beats Powerbeats Fit are a minor revamp on the already great Beats Fit Pro bringing them into line with the rest of Apple’s earbuds.\n\nThey aren’t as comfortable or accomplished on the audio or noise-cancelling fronts as the AirPods Pro 3. Nor are they quite as great for running as the Powerbeats Pro 2 with their volume rocker buttons. But the Fit are easier to live with on the commute without the big over-ear hooks and more comfortable to wear with glasses without sacrificing the secure fit.\n\nThat makes them great workout buds that can pull double-duty as regular earbuds with good enough noise cancelling and great sound. Plus they have most of the fancy features of AirPods with Apple gear and full compatibility with Android thanks to the Beats app. Not many earbuds can claim that privilege.\n\nPros: secure fit, good sound, solid noise cancelling and transparency modes, decent battery life, good case, good call quality, spatial audio, cross-platform compatibility with enhanced features for iPhone and Android.\n\nCons: expensive for workout buds, no multipoint connectivity, ear hook can be uncomfortable after a while, battery can’t be replaced making them ultimately disposable.",

    "fullText": "Push to restart uranium mining in Patagonia has sparked fears about the environmental impact and loss of sovereignty over key resources\n\nOn an outcrop above the Chubut River, one of the few to cut across the arid Patagonian steppe of southern Argentina, Sergio Pichiñán points across a wide swath of scrubland to colourful rock formations on a distant hillside.\n\n“That’s where they dug for uranium before, and when the miners left, they left the mountain destroyed, the houses abandoned, and nobody ever studied the water,” he says, citing suspicions arising from cases of cancer and skin diseases in his community. “If they want to open this back up, we’re all pretty worried around here.”\n\nPichiñán lives in Cerro Cóndor, a hamlet with a sparse Indigenous Mapuche population due to the area’s harsh summers, cold winters and little rain. The National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) mined uranium here in the 1970s and it is now in focus as President Javier Milei aims to shift Argentina’s nuclear strategy.\n\nThe remote region sees few visitors, but in November, a delegation from the International Atomic Energy Agency visited as part of an Integrated Uranium Production Cycle Review. Cerro Solo, adjacent to the shuttered mines, is one of CNEA’s largest proven uranium deposits, and restarting mining of the ore is the first step in Milei’s new nuclear plan.\n\nThe others are to develop small modular reactors, use them to power AI datacentres, export reactors and uranium, and partially privatise Nucleoeléctrica, the state-owned nuclear energy utility.\n\nYet the plan is facing fierce criticism from both pro- and anti-nuclear voices. Argentina’s non-military nuclear programme is 75 years old. It exports research reactors that produce isotopes for medical radiology and science, and its three nuclear plants – Atucha I and II and Embalse – provide about 5% of the country’s electricity.\n\nUranium production in Chubut declined in the 1980s, and the mines were closed in the 1990s; since another closed in Mendoza in 1997, Argentina has imported uranium, so many see restarting uranium extraction as a strategic move.\n\nAdriana Serquis, a nuclear physicist, is not so sure. She was president of CNEA until 2024 and was recently elected to congress. She says: “The plan doesn’t seem oriented toward supplying our own plants, but rather exporting uranium directly to the US. It would appear the objective is to satisfy others’ needs while destroying our own capabilities.”\n\nDioxitek, a state-run subsidiary of CNEA, processes imported uranium into uranium dioxide for use in Argentina’s power stations, but signed a commitment in August last year with the US-based Nano Nuclear Energy to supply it with uranium hexafluoride. As Argentina’s reactors run on natural or low-enriched uranium oxide rather than uranium hexafluoride, it is likely that any uranium extracted in Argentina would be exported to the US rather than be used for local energy production.\n\nIn parallel, Nano Nuclear Energy signed a memorandum of understanding with the British-Argentinian company UrAmerica, which has large holdings in Chubut and plans to mine uranium. One of the stated goals of the agreement is “strengthening US energy security by sourcing materials for nuclear fuel from a reliable partner”.\n\nDiego Hurtado, ex-president of the national nuclear regulatory authority and former CNEA vice-president, says Argentina’s proven uranium reserves would fulfil domestic demand for about 70 years, though less if nuclear energy were expanded.\n\n“Argentina doesn’t have extra uranium,” he says. “Exporting uranium isn’t an Argentine nuclear plan; it’s banana republic-style mining: ‘I’ll sell you raw materials so you can use them to generate employment and industrial capacity in your country instead of here.’”\n\nThe nuclear plan signifies a realignment towards Washington by Milei, who has declared his country to be an “unconditional ally of the US”. In September, the far-right president signed Argentina up as the first Latin American member of the US Foundational Infrastructure for the Responsible Use of Small Modular Reactor Technology (First) programme.\n\nHurtado says Argentina has little to gain from the arrangement. “Since the late 60s, the US has systematically tried to undermine Argentina’s nuclear development,” he says. “They treat Latin America as their back yard and don’t want competitors for their technology here.”\n\nDuring his tenure at CNEA, Hurtado met US nuclear specialists who put pressure on Argentina to reject the Chinese Hualong One reactor, which was lined up to be the country’s fourth nuclear power station. Milei has suspended this project.\n\nSerquis, at a recent forum on national sovereignty in Patagonia, said of the situation: “The hegemonic model of countries like the US or European countries, that have achieved certain technologies, says ‘Once I’ve gone up the ladder, I knock it down so no one else comes up.’”\n\nOther parts of the plan have also drawn criticism. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are at the forefront of nuclear energy development. To date, there are only two in operation – one in China and one in Russia.\n\nArgentina has been developing an SMR, known as Carem, for decades, with construction under way since 2014. In 2024, the OECD’s Nuclear Energy Agency surveyed 52 SMR projects worldwide and listed Carem as among the four most advanced. Argentina has invested more than £560m, and estimates show the project is about two-thirds complete.\n\nYet the Milei administration has declared it a failure and in effect mothballed it. The new plan focuses instead on a new SMR project, the ACR300, at only 1% of development, just patented by an Argentinian state-run company but through its subsidiary in the US.\n\n“Not only have they stopped investing in the project, but all the engineering and research teams are being dismantled,” Serquis says. “They say they’re going to have four SMRs built in five years, and that’s just fiction.”\n\nAll this comes in the context of Milei’s chainsaw-style dismemberment of public research and environmental protection agencies. “Milei took office with a potent discourse of stigmatising science and technology, and rapidly defamed them across the board, from CNEA to the National Water Institute to the National Weather Service to public universities,” Hurtado says. “It’s catastrophic.”\n\nTrade unions claim that between 80% and 90% of CNEA workers receive salaries below the poverty line – increasing emigration and brain drain. In 2024, the country’s secretariat for innovation, science and technology only spent 7% of its allocated budget. Public universities have seen budgets slashed.\n\nPartially privatising the public nuclear utility, Nucleoeléctrica, sets off other alarm bells. The plan, formally launched by the economy ministry in November, aims to sell 44% of the state company to a private investor. Although not holding an absolute majority, the buyer would have the largest stake, giving them decision-making control.\n\nDemian Reidel, Milei’s lead on nuclear matters, was the chair of the council of presidential advisers until being appointed as head of Nucleoeléctrica, where he is now facing a scandal about the company’s procurement and alleged overpricing of service and software contracts.\n\nHe did not respond to requests for comment, but has described the privatisation as “what any normal company does to attract investment”.\n\nNucleoeléctrica, however, is one of the few state companies in Argentina that runs a budget surplus, posting a record 17.2bn pesos (£8.6m) in the first quarter of 2025. Opposition parties in congress proposed a bill to declare Nucleoeléctrica a strategic priority and prevent privatisation, but they are likely to lack the two-thirds majority to override Milei’s presidential veto.\n\nIsidro Baschar, a former member of the company’s directorate, says Argentina risks losing strategic capacities and reaping no benefit from privatisation, noting that nuclear power worldwide is overwhelmingly state-run (though most commercial plants are privately owned in the US).\n\n“Nuclear energy combines critical infrastructure, extremely long-term investments, highly specialised licensing and international commitments regarding security and non-proliferation. None of that can be sustained through market logic alone,” he says.\n\nSerquis, Hurtado, and Baschar all highlight nuclear power, alongside the solar potential in the high, dry provinces of the north-west and Patagonia’s strong winds, as key elements for meeting emissions-reduction goals and fighting the climate crisis.\n\nMilei is a known climate denier, calling global heating “a socialist lie”, and wants new nuclear plants not to replace fossil fuels but to attract more demand. He and Reidel have visited Silicon Valley and various industry conferences to pitch Argentina, and Patagonia in particular, to investors as a prime site for nuclear-powered AI datacentres.\n\nBaschar says: “Projecting datacentres, or ‘nuclear cities’, in Patagonia seems attractive in the ideas lab, but it’s politically non-viable. [Patagonia] is the region of the country with the strongest popular rejection of these endeavours.”\n\nChubut has a broad-based and deeply entrenched grassroots anti-mining movement. A 2003 referendum on open-pit gold-mining received an 81% “no” vote, leading to a law prohibiting the practice throughout the province. In 2021, lawmakers tried to open the central steppe to mining but withdrew after protesters blocked highways, swarmed the capital and set fire to government buildings.\n\nThe anti-nuclear movement goes back to the 1980s, when a radioactive waste dump was proposed near Gastre, a remote village in central Chubut. After years of popular opposition scuttled the project, cities and towns across Patagonia passed anti-nuclear ordinances banning the presence or transit of nuclear materials.\n\nNow, near the old mine sites in central Chubut, tens of thousands of tonnes of old uranium tailings sit behind only a chain-link fence and a sign that says “Restricted Area”.\n\nOrlando Carriqueo, spokesperson for the Mapuche-Tehuelche parliament of Río Negro, an Indigenous organisation in another Patagonian province, says public opinion in the region is concerned about the consequences of uranium mining for fuel production and about waste management. “We’re being turned into an energy colony,” he says.\n\nReports by CNEA over the past three administrations show no radiation monitoring at the site. Less than a kilometre away, the Río Chubut flows past on its way to supply drinking water to the towns of Trelew, Gaiman and Rawson on the Atlantic coast.\n\nPichiñán, riding his horse past the abandoned mines, says he fears that future generations could be deluded by the same broken promises of the past. “What happened back then, when they told us we were going to be rich? Where’s all that wealth? Where are the people who were going to have work and money?” he asks.\n\n“I don’t want my child to be 30, 40 years old one day and have to show them this kind of abandonment,” he says. “Whatever happens, we can’t let them do this.”",

    "description": "With Arsenal playing twice this week in FPL, a triple-up on their assets is a no-brainer - and why not captain Mr Reliable, Gabriel?",
    "fullText": "Being a double gameweek, picking three Arsenal players in your FPL team is an easy choice.\n\nAnd, despite such a strong real-life squad, they don't have a tonne of reliable FPL assets to pick from, especially with Bukayo Saka unlikely to be fit for both games.\n\nIt's basically going to be Gabriel, who is essential, and another defensive player - David Raya, Jurrien Timber or William Saliba.\n\nAnd then Declan Rice will be the most popular forward choice, given he is the third highest-scoring midfielder and offers regular defensive contribution point returns along with his attacking threat.\n\nThat's basically it. Every other Arsenal player is a minutes risk but if you are chasing points and fancy a punt then Martin Zubimendi (five goals this season and two in his past two outings) or Viktor Gyokeres (three goals in two games) could be worth a shout.\n\nThe team of the week is selected based on current FPL prices to fit within a £100m budget, as if you were playing a Free Hit.\n\nCaptain Bruno Fernandes (20 points) did well again along with a triple Arsenal clean sheet and Joao Pedro (8) for a decent 67-point week.\n\nDavid Raya, Arsenal, keeper, £5.9m - Brentford (a) and Wolves (a)\n\nGabriel (captain), Arsenal, defender, £7.1m - Brentford (a) and Wolves (a)\n\nJurrien Timber, Arsenal, defender, £6.4m - Brentford (a) and Wolves (a)\n\nI'm going for the defensive triple-up again after it worked a treat in gameweek 25.\n\nAnd Gabriel is the premium captaincy choice this week. He's averaging 7.1 points per match this season, making him the fourth highest-scoring asset in the game.\n\nThe Wolves match feels like a nailed-on clean sheet and, given their current defensive form, you're hoping they can keep Thiago and Brentford at bay too.\n\nDaniel Munoz, Crystal Palace, £5.8m - Burnley (h)\n\nChris Richards, Crystal Palace, £4.4m - Burnley (h)\n\nThis week's team is also all-in on the Palace defence at home to struggling Burnley.\n\nRichards has hit 'defcon' on 10 occasions this season and missed out by a point four times too.\n\nMunoz, surprisingly, does not stand out stats-wise in many areas, unlike last season.\n\nBut you only have to watch a Palace game to see the attacking threat he poses - he's basically a right-winger.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Manchester United, £9.8m - West Ham (a)\n\nFernandes has 42 points in his five games since returning from injury - you can't afford to leave him out.\n\nIsmaila Sarr, Crystal Palace, £6.3m - Burnley (h)\n\nFPL managers need to pay attention to Sarr. Before his pre-Afcon injury, he was one of the best-value-for-money midfielders in the game.\n\nPer 90 minutes, Sarr has the best expected goals (0.43) of any midfielder in the game.\n\nHe should be on penalties and faces Burnley, Wolves and Leeds at home in his next five.\n\nCole Palmer, Chelsea, £10.5m - Leeds (h)\n\nGo on then! Palmer is such a tempting FPL pick but his injury and form struggles have made him easy to ignore most of the time - until now.\n\nA hat-trick at Wolves was evidence of how he can accumulate attacking returns with ease - two penalties helped him to 20 points.\n\nAnd Chelsea's juicy run - they face Burnley at home next - makes him an even better pick.\n\nInjury concerns remain, but he only played 60 minutes at Wolves and Chelsea don't play a league game for 11 days after the Leeds match.\n\nErling Haaland, Manchester City, £14.9m - Fulham (h)\n\nWelcome back, Erling. Brave owners might have benched the under-performing Norwegian against Liverpool and they paid the price.\n\nHe has double-digit haul potential every time he plays and a home game against Fulham could provide that. He'd be a captain option if Arsenal weren't doubling.\n\nJoao Pedro, Chelsea, £7.6m - Leeds (h)\n\nThe Brazilian has 38 points in his past four matches. He's on fire and, as mentioned with Palmer, game time isn't a concern given the big break until Chelsea's next league game.\n\nHe could get a rest in the FA Cup match at Hull on Friday, rather than against Leeds.\n\nMatheus Mane, Wolves, £4.6m - Nottingham Forest (a), Arsenal (h)\n\nWith big hitters Fernandes, Palmer and Haaland in this week's squad, a budget enabler is needed and Mane fits the bill.\n\nIt feels like a single gameweek for Wolves with one game of their double coming against the defensive might of Arsenal.\n\nBut Mane has four returns in eight games and is on a lot of Wolves' set-pieces - if he gets anything against Forest then the Arsenal match is just a bonus.\n\nMartin Dubravka, Burnley, keeper, £4m - Crystal Palace (a)\n\nJames Hill, Bournemouth, defender, £3.9m - Everton (a)\n\nPape Matar Sarr, Tottenham, midfielder, £4.5m - Newcastle (h)\n\nJosh King, Fulham, midfielder, £4.4m - Manchester City (a)\n\nGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League team\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place",

    "fullText": "Four players were ejected after a mass brawl as the Detroit Pistons beat the Charlotte Hornets 110-104 in a bad-tempered NBA fixture.\n\nDetroit's Jalen Duren was fouled by Charlotte's Moussa Diabate during the third quarter, with the pair then confronting one another and appearing to butt heads.\n\nDiabate had to be held back as he tried to hit Duren, before several other players got involved in the incident.\n\nDetroit forward Isaiah Stewart confronted Charlotte's Miles Bridges and put him in a headlock before appearing to strike him multiple times.\n\nThe brawl lasted about 30 seconds, ending with a brief police presence on the floor.\n\nDiabate, Duren, Stewart and Bridges were ejected - and Hornets coach Charles Lee was kicked out in the fourth quarter after he had to be restrained while angrily shouting at the officials having disagreed with a decision.\n\n\"Emotions were flaring. At the end of the day, we would love to keep it basketball, but things happen. Everybody was just playing hard,\" Duren said after the match.\n\n\"This isn't the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be.\n\n\"At the end of the day, emotions got high with everybody being competitive. Things happen.\"\n\nBridges later apologised to fans, writing on Instagram: \"Sorry Hornets nation! Sorry Hornets Organization! Always going to protect my team-mates forever.\"\n\nLead official John Goble said in a post-game report the players were ejected because they \"engaged in fighting activity during the dead ball\".\n\n\"After review, we assessed fighting fouls, and by rule, they were ejected from the game,\" he added.\n\nLee, asked about the clash between Diabate and Duren that triggered the wider brawl, said: \"Two guys got in a heated conversation and then it kind of spiralled from there.\"\n\nOf his own ejection in the fourth quarter, Lee added: \"I've got to have a little bit better emotional control in that moment.\"\n\nElsewhere, Golden State Warriors' Steph Curry will miss Sunday's All-Star game with an injury to his right knee.\n\nHowever, the Warriors are hopeful Curry will return after the All-Star break for the game against the Boston Celtics on 19 February.",

    "description": "Real Madrid striker Endrick's impact on loan at Lyon has been immediate, and is fuelling the teenager's \"dream\" of playing for Brazil at the World Cup.",
    "fullText": "Even those who do not follow French football in its most granular detail will be aware of the plight that could have befallen Lyon this summer.\n\nSpared from administrative relegation to Ligue 2 just five and a half weeks before the start of the season, the club's future in the French top flight hinged on their capacity to fulfil financial promises.\n\nA firesale of the side's most valuable assets duly ensued, and with it, expectations of a third successive season of European football dwindled.\n\nConstrained by their financial frailties, Les Gones, spearheaded by sporting director Matthieu Louis-Jean, had to work diligently, embarking on an agile recruitment drive.\n\nSpotting talent from lesser-known European leagues became a central tenet of their philosophy.\n\n\"We worked on different markets,\" outlined the former Nottingham Forest right-back in September.\n\nAmid a flurry of moves, Pavel Sulc and Ruben Kluivert arrived on permanent deals from Viktoria Plzen and Casa Pia respectively, while Adam Karabec joined from Sparta Prague on loan.\n\nLouis-Jean has cultivated a burgeoning reputation as a strategic operator, but his most innovative market manoeuvre would have to wait until the winter window.\n\nHaving deviated from their reactive tendencies of the past, Lyon were left without a central striker of note, preferring to secure the temporary services of Martin Satriano on loan.\n\n\"We took a decision on the final day of the transfer window to leave the position of a first-choice striker open,\" said general director Michael Gerlinger.\n\nLouis-Jean, and Lyon's wider recruitment department, were convinced an opportunity would present itself in January. Their intuition soon morphed into prophecy.\n\nHaving amassed just 99 minutes of action for Real Madrid during the first half of the season, Brazil striker Endrick needed an escape. Lyon were more than happy to provide sanctuary for a player and talisman they desperately craved.\n\n\"We had been waiting for a number nine for so long,\" said Louis-Jean upon the 19-year-old's unveiling after joining on loan until the end of the season.\n\nAt a club where strikers are held in such reverence, his impact has been almost divine.\n\nHe scored 42 minutes into his debut against Lille in the last 32 of the French Cup. Another four goals have followed in five games.\n\nThree of those came against Metz, making him the youngest player to score a Ligue 1 hat-trick for Lyon, surpassing the great Bernard Lacombe, who had held the record for 54 years.\n\nBefore Saturday's match with Nantes, no Lyon player had been directly involved in more goals (six), had more shots on target (14), or completed more dribbles (19) than the Brazilian since his arrival.\n\nEndrick's signing perpetuates a long-held legacy of Brazilians representing the club.\n\nJuninho Pernambucano, Cris and Sonny Anderson are just a few to have spent significant portions of their careers with Lyon, each contributing to the club's unprecedented run of seven successive Ligue 1 crowns between 2002 and 2008.\n\n\"I know there are a lot [of Brazilians] that have played for the club, and many of them have had a fantastic career here,\" said Endrick during his first interview with French newspaper L'Equipe.\n\nLucas Paqueta and Bruno Guimaraes, Brazil team-mates of Endrick, provided counsel prior to his move.\n\n\"Before coming, I spoke with Paqueta and Bruno,\" he said. \"They told me it was a place I could be really happy.\"\n\nPersonal fulfillment, and a chance \"to play football\" with this summer's World Cup looming, he says were driving factors in his decision to join.\n\n\"Obviously it's a dream I have - that won't change. If you don't play well for your club, however, you can't have a chance of playing for Brazil,\" he added.\n\nIf strikers are revered in Lyon, they are held in almost sacred status in Brazil.\n\n\"We don't have that mobile number nine in the Brazil side,\" says former Lyon captain Cris.\n\n\"We have Gabriel Jesus, Richarlison, but there's a space there for him to help the side with his mobility and the way he sees the game.\"\n\nUltimately, Brazil manager Carlo Ancelotti will be the man who decides if Endrick makes the plane.\n\n\"We had a wonderful conversation,\" said Endrick when asked about whether the Italian had been in contact before his move.\n\n\"He gave me some advice that has stayed with me,\" he added. \"Now, I have to work in order to improve and become a better player.\"\n\nLyon, and Ligue 1, provide the perfect platform for him to do just that.\n\n\"He's very explosive, very quick, very good in one-on-one situations,\" enthused Lyon manager Paulo Fonseca after his debut against Lille.\n\nHis contentious sending-off for two yellow cards against Nantes on Saturday, however, following a petulant kick out after some robust challenges against him, provides a timely reminder of the adjustments Endrick needs to make.\n\n\"When there are players of that calibre, we have to make sure to contain them,\" said Nantes manager Ahmed Kantari in the aftermath.\n\nHerein lies the challenge Endrick will have to confront - at Madrid he was part of a constellation of stars, while here he assumes that mantle almost uniquely.\n\nThat influence transcends the pitch, too - his signing representing a commercial coup as well as a sporting one.\n\n\"It's obvious his notoriety will boost the club's image,\" Gerlinger said during the Brazilian's presentation.\n\nThe results have been tangible. His arrival video, published on the club's official Instagram account, is the club's most-watched on the platform, while highlights of games against Metz, Lille, Brest and Stade Laval - in which Endrick featured - top their YouTube charts.\n\nLyon will hope his impending one-game suspension does not stymie his, or their, seamless progress of late.\n\nPrior to Endrick's arrival, Fonseca's side had recorded a run of four wins in all competitions - subsequently extended to 12.\n\nHaving crafted a favourable route to the Europa League final courtesy of their top-place finish during the league phase, a spot in the quarter-finals of the French Cup secured, and firmly in the hunt for Champions League qualification, Endrick's hopes of \"making history\" at the club - like so many compatriots before him - may just come true.\n\nListen to the latest Football Daily podcast",

    "description": "Ilia Malinin is not like most figure skaters. Even when he makes mistakes, he is still so far ahead of the rest that he wins Olympic gold.",
    "fullText": "After sending the Milan-Cortina crowd into a frenzy with his back flip in the figure skating team event, all eyes will be on US skater Ilia Malinin as he strives for individual Winter Olympic gold.\n\nHe made mistakes in the team event but was still the only participant to record more than 200 points, securing USA team gold by a single point ahead of Japan on Sunday.\n\nThat sums up the 21-year-old, the biggest star of his sport, who is set for global fame at Milan-Cortina 2026.\n\n\"It's his Olympics to lose,\" Olympic figure skating gold medallist Robin Cousins told BBC Sport. \"After watching him over the last five years - he has grown. The talent was always there; he is otherworldly in that respect.\n\n\"Is it messy? Yes, but I watched him live and I got it. Now he has grown into that slightly quirky style - it isn't polished, and I don't want it to be.\n\n\"Anyone lucky enough to be in Milan, it will be one of those 'I was there' moments.\"\n\nMalinin has not been beaten in competition for almost two and a half years. Competing in his first Olympics, he arrives with the nickname 'Quad God' having become the only skater to successfully land the quadruple axel.\n\nThe move requires a skater to launch themselves into a jump, spin four and a half times in the air, and cleanly land backwards.\n\nMalinin did not pull out this move in the team event, although it was registered in his planned program. He landed triple axels instead - costing him points but still executed so perfectly that it provided a net benefit.\n\nDay-by-day guide to the Winter Olympics\n\nFull schedule including times of medal events\n\nWinter Olympics 2026 medal table\n\nHe made up for it by landing the first legal backflip at an Olympic Games since US champion Terry Kubicka in 1976 - after which it was banned for safety reasons.\n\nThanks in part to skaters like France's Surya Bonaly - who performed the move illegally but successfully at Nagano 1998 - the backflip is now legal again; and Malinin became the first to land it at the Games on only one foot.\n\nSo Malinin is already making history and winning golds, and he isn't even at his best yet.\n\nHe was due to only perform in the short program in the team event, but with USA's Olympic title from Beijing 2022 under threat by Japan, he agreed to perform in the free skate too.\n\n\"It was just such an honour, all my team-mates we have this passion for figure skating,\" he told the BBC after winning team gold. \"And for many of us, this was just the start.\n\n\"I didn't want to go full capacity. I want to pace myself correctly going up to the individuals.\"\n\nIt is in the free skate where Malinin dominates. Japan's Yuma Kagiyama outshone Malinin in the team short program, just as he did in December's Grand Prix Final.\n\nAt the Grand Prix Final, Malinin was third after the short but still finished 30 points clear of the field after the free skate.\n\nHe has such an advantage because of a deadly combination of fearlessness and ability. His program for the free skate has a much higher technical score than any of his rivals - judges will give extra credit for ambition and he will also be rewarded with a higher component score.\n\nWatch two live streams and highlights on BBC iPlayer (UK only), updates on BBC Radio 5 Live and live text commentary and video highlights on the BBC Sport website and app.\n\nBlessed with natural athleticism, Malinin has also been incubated in the perfect training environment.\n\nBorn in Virginia to immigrants from Uzbekistan, both of his parents - Tatiana Malinina and Roman Skorniakov - represented their home nation in Olympic figure skating.\n\nMalinin has the masculine version of his mother's maiden name as his parents were worried Skorniakov would be too difficult for Americans to pronounce - and his maternal grandfather, Valery Malinin, is a figure skating coach in Russia.\n\nThis environment has produced perhaps the physical ideal of the male figure skater. When broken down into scientific numbers, Malinin's ability becomes truly astonishing.\n\nTake a triple axel. Analysis at the most recent World Championships showed that the average skater, when successfully performing the element, leapt a distance of 2.77m and reached a height of nearly 60cm.\n\nIn contrast, Malinin's quadruple axel sends him only 2.38m in distance - but to a height of 90cm, similar to the standing jump of an NBA player.\n\nTo perform the axel jump, a skater - travelling at about 15 miles per hour - swings their shoulders to snap into the spin, drawing their arms and legs inwards to reduce resistance.\n\nIn order to successfully perform four and a half spins, Malinin must rotate at about 350 revolutions per minute - a similar rate to the average kitchen blender.\n\nAnd then he has to land it, with huge amounts of force going through one leg while maintaining perfect form with the other, and the rest of his body.\n\nMost sports lessen the shock of landing with soft shoes or surfaces; Malinin is landing on ice on a metal blade - all while stopping the rotational force. And while not getting dizzy.\n\nThat is why he is called the 'Quad God'. That is why these could be Malinin's Games.",

    "fullText": "Cricket may be behind the times with innovation and how involved coaches are with on-field decisions, says England wicketkeeper Jos Buttler.\n\nDuring England's victory over Nepal on Sunday, coach Brendon McCullum was seen relaying messages from the dressing room via a walkie talkie.\n\nThose messages were passed from the dugout by the boundary edge to England captain Harry Brook on the field.\n\n\"I've played in the IPL [Indian Premier League] with Gujarat where [coach] Ashish Nehra was very active on the boundary rope,\" said Buttler, who was England's white-ball captain until last year.\n\n\"It seems like cricket is the sport where we're still a bit behind in that area.\n\n\"You look at other sports, like rugby where they run messages on. Maybe that will come more and more into cricket.\"\n\nMcCullum, whose side play West Indies in their second match at the T20 World Cup on Wednesday, has been using the walkie talkies throughout recent weeks, including in England's successful white-ball tour to Sri Lanka.\n\nUnder World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan, England trialled using cards with numbers and letters to send coded messages from the team analyst.\n\n\"It's been there so he [McCullum] can just send a few messages down to the guys on the bench and if there's anything he's seeing from up the top to relay on to the pitch for Harry and the bowlers,\" said Buttler.\n\n\"It is just a more obvious line of communication.\"\n\nAn almighty scare - but are England learning?\n\nIndia-Pakistan to go ahead as government ends boycott request\n\nhttps://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cx28klldqn1o\n\nCricket is almost unique in sport given the captain remains the key decision-maker in the middle. A coach also has to contend with the large distances from the dressing room.\n\nLong before England's coded messages, South Africa coach Bob Woolmer and captain Hansie Cronje wore earpieces to communicate during a match against India at the 1999 World Cup.\n\nThat tactic was quickly banned by organisers.\n\nThe England camp is playing down the significance of the latest methods but it appears a more hands-on approach from the typically relaxed McCullum.\n\nMcCullum, who oversaw England's Ashes defeat this winter, has presented a similar laid-back look on the sidelines regardless of the match situation throughout his time with England. He has spoken of wanting players to use their instinct on the field.\n\n\"That's obviously the energy he wants to have to allow guys to feel less pressure in a game that has a lot of pressure,\" Buttler said.\n\n\"That image is important to him, but don't mistake that for someone whose mind is relaxed and whose not got his finger on the pulse.\n\n\"He wouldn't be a great player and great captain without having that, being fiercely competitive and a will to win.\"\n\nEngland have made one change for the match against West Indies with all-rounder Jamie Overton replacing left-arm quick Luke Wood.\n\nThe Windies, who beat Scotland in their opening match, are expected to provide England a different challenge compared to Nepal with their trademark six-hitting.\n\nSunday's match was England's first meeting with Nepal in any format. In contrast, England have played four T20 series against West Indies since the start of 2022.\n\nThey were comfortable winners of the past two - a 3-0 victory at home last year and a 3-1 win in the Caribbean the previous winter.\n\nWednesday's match will also be played on a fresh pitch and, crucially, later in the evening.\n\nThat should help run-scoring and dew could have a significant impact, giving an advantage to the chasing side.\n\nEngland XI to play West Indies: Phil Salt, Jos Buttler (wk), Jacob Bethell, Tom Banton, Harry Brook (capt), Sam Curran, Will Jacks, Liam Dawson, Jamie Overton, Jofra Archer, Adil Rashid",

I'm so proud.\"\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nDuring five years as defensive co-ordinator of the London Warriors, Durde was able to earn coaching internships with the Dallas Cowboys and Atlanta Falcons, before the latter made him Britain's first full-time NFL coach in 2018.\n\nHe progressed through roles with Atlanta and Dallas before Seattle's new head coach Mike Macdonald made Durde his defensive co-ordinator in 2024.\n\n'AD', as he is known at the Seahawks, has since helped create a defence he describes as \"fast, physical, ball-hungry, and they work as a collective\".\n\n\"AD is an absolute game-changer for us,\" said Macdonald on Monday. \"It's not just an incredible story that got him to this point, it's him as a football mind, a football coach.\n\n\"He's someone that has really brought us together, and the way that our defence plays inspired football is a great tribute to how AD operates, and what he brings to our football team and our organisation. I'm really happy for AD.\n\n\"He's just an absolute beast and he's so much fun to work with. He's right there alongside, building this whole thing. It's been a special journey.\"\n\nThe Seahawks dominated the New England Patriots to win 29-13 on Sunday, but Durde has not just become a Super Bowl champion, he has helped forge a defence that will go down in NFL folklore.\n\nSeattle's defence has been dubbed 'the Dark Side' and produced a performance long-time NFL analyst Cris Collinsworth said was \"as good as I have ever seen\".\n\n\"That's pretty cool,\" said Durde. \"But we have to give credit to the players. They made a commitment, they wanted to be the best in the world, and we got the outcome we wanted.\"\n\nWas this the ultimate Super Bowl redemption story?\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nAs he finished speaking to reporters after Sunday's game, with a British flag around his waist, Durde admitted he felt emotional.\n\n\"I'm trying to hold it back, I just want to get out of here,\" he joked.\n\nNFL analyst Phoebe Schecter used to coach with Durde on the NFL's International Player Pathway programme and shared a moment with him on the field.\n\n\"As someone that's known him for quite some time, [I know] he doesn't like to be emotional, but he couldn't help himself,\" she said.\n\n\"The moment is so big, the achievement is so big, and he knows that he's made history.\"\n\nDurde has spoken about being the best he can be, to make it easier for others to follow his lead, and Schecter is excited about what Durde's story means for the international game.\n\n\"Aden's great because he's not just thinking about himself in the moment,\" Schecter said.\n\n\"For years he's been thinking about other people, building the NFL Academy and the International Player Pathway programme. He's constantly sending that elevator back down.\n\n\"I think he knows how much it means, not just to the UK but to the rest of the international space, [for people] to think 'I could be that person one day, I could coach in the NFL'.\"\n\nWhile working with NFL UK, Durde shared an office with two-time Super Bowl winner Osi Umenyiora and they founded the IPP programme.\n\n\"I remember Osi telling me about [Durde] back in the day and then followed his journey,\" said NFL executive Peter O'Reilly.\n\n\"How talented he is and how well respected he is by his players, and what a great person he is, that just makes him someone you want to root for.\"\n\nThe IPP helped Britain's Efe Obada and Australia's Jordan Mailata get into the NFL, and former rugby league player Mailata won a Super Bowl last year with the Philadelphia Eagles.\n\n\"Whether it's coaching or playing, having those role models, those local heroes, where someone in the UK can look up and say 'OK, there's a path for me', is really important - like last year for a young Australian looking at Jordan Mailata,\" O'Reilly added.\n\n\"The IPP is also a great breeding ground for international coaches. You want that mix of coaches, and we've been in engaged in how we build that pipeline, making sure programmes for coaching development are not just US-based but global.\"\n\nAnd Durde has challenged others to take a shot, saying: \"You just have to set goals and understand there's always people out there that do believe in you. You've just got to push forward and go for what you believe in. That's what life's about.\"\n\nWhat's next for NFL as latest international games confirmed?\n\nOnce Durde joined Seattle's on-field celebrations at Levi's Stadium, he was joined by his wife Kate and their two sons.\n\nTheir eldest son, Kane Doyle-Durde, now works as a scout for the Dallas Cowboys and their youngest Dylan is working in coaching.\n\n\"We just hugged, we were grateful for the moment,\" said Durde.\n\n\"A lot of people have sacrificed a lot for me to be sitting here, but you don't see all the people around me that helped me get here. I'm very grateful for them.\"\n\nThey include many back in the UK, who Durde aims to catch up with now the NFL season is over.\n\n\"I've got to get back to London, get this mayhem out of the way,\" he laughed. \"I need to go home.\"\n\nIn particular, Durde is looking forward to seeing his close friend Marvin Allen, one of a few Britons to own a Super Bowl ring having been on the Pittsburgh Steelers' practice squad when they became NFL champions in 2009.\n\nDurde had two interviews for head-coach positions during the current hiring cycle and - although he is set to remain with Seattle next season - Allen is confident he will become the NFL's first overseas head coach.\n\n\"Aden has come from obscurity to take an American sport by storm,\" he said.\n\n\"One day NFL owners will say 'this guy that's comes from nowhere to win a Super Bowl, let's give that guy a go'.\"\n\nThe 'incredible story' of the British coach at the Super Bowl\n\nGet American Football news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Liverpool boss Arne Slot says this season is the toughest he has had as a manager \"by a mile\" and his side are \"not performing to Liverpool's standards\".\n\nDefeat by Manchester City on Sunday leaves the Premier League champions sixth in the table - four points behind fifth-placed Chelsea.\n\nLiverpool are level on points with seventh-placed Brentford and would have dropped below the Bees on goal difference had Rayan Cherki's late third goal for City not been disallowed.\n\nSlot replaced Jurgen Klopp as Reds boss in June 2024 and led the club to a record-equalling 20th top-flight title in his first season in charge.\n\nHowever, they have struggled this term despite spending almost £450m on new signings in the summer, including a British record £125m for Alexander Isak.\n\nLiverpool have won 11, drawn six and lost eight games in the league so far in 2025-26.\n\nAsked by BBC Sport whether this was the toughest season he has had, Slot said: \"By a mile. All the other seasons I have managed, there was only positives.\n\n\"I don't think I have ever lost two games in a row [until now]. It's an exception for me, I am not used to it.\n\n\"I don't think we feel we've only lost two of our last 17. A draw feels like a loss.\n\n\"The players know what the standards of Liverpool mean and we aren't performing to those standards. They feel that disappointment.\"\n\nThe likelihood is five Premier League teams, rather than the usual four, will qualify for next season's Champions League.\n\nLast month, Slot said Liverpool would have an acceptable season if they \"improve in one box\" - but could have a special campaign if they \"improve in both boxes\".\n\nHowever, on Tuesday the Dutchman suggested his side will have to be \"close to perfection\" to secure Champions League football next season - and he is aware of the impact of missing out.\n\n\"If we don't have Champions League football [next season], it's definitely not been an acceptable season,\" Slot added.\n\n\"When I arrived here and only signed Federico Chiesa, it was after a Europa League season.\n\n\"That does have an enormous impact on the way this club is run. I am completely aware of that.\"\n\nLiverpool travel to face Sunderland - who are unbeaten at home - on Wednesday at 20:15 GMT.\n\nSlot may be struggling for right-back options at the Stadium of Light, with Dominik Szoboszlai - who has been filling in at full-back - suspended after his late red card against Manchester City.\n\nConor Bradley is out for the rest of the season, Jeremie Frimpong has not featured since injuring his groin against Qarabag and Joe Gomez has been out with a knock.\n\nStriker Isak and centre-half Giovanni Leoni are also long-term absentees.\n\n\"It's different to lead the team after a loss or multiple losses and draws than a win but I don't think anybody in this building thinks I've completely changed,\" Slot added.\n\n\"There's still a possibility where we can do sometime special this season.\"",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are rolling, even if they have made a massive change recently. With James Harden in the fold, it appears that the team is doing much better, as they have a healthy playmaker leading the way on offense.\n\nHarden feels at home with the Cavaliers, which is a good sign of what is to come for Cleveland. He has been a helpful piece for the Cavaliers in his short stint so far, which should be quite promising for their goals of making it far in the postseason.\n\nThe Cavaliers have only played two games with Harden in the lineup, but they look great with the former MVP. He had a near triple-double on Monday against the Denver Nuggets with 22 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists.\n\nDonovan Mitchell was once again the standout with 32 points and 10 assists. However, Harden also got the most out of Jarrett Allen, who had a monstrous 22 points and 13 rebounds. Harden always gets the most out of his big men, and Allen is not an exception.\n\nMORE:Travis Scott screams after James Harden's Cavaliers debut\n\nWhile he is a new player on the Cavaliers roster, Harden looks like he is at home. Before the season started, Cleveland was projected as a title contender.\n\nNow that Harden is with this team, they could possibly get over the hump. The Cavaliers have had a tough season, but recent weeks have shown they could meet the preseason expectations.\n\n\"We found a way to get it done. This team has a lot of unselfish guys. Donovan gave me the ball multiple times down the stretch and trusted me to make a play. A great group of guys. I’m happy to be a part of it,\" Harden said after beating the Nuggets.\n\nMoving forward, Harden should find his footing in Cleveland. It will be one of the toughest matchups for most teams, as the Cavaliers are ready to meet those title-contender expectations.\n\nCavs' James Harden, Donovan Mitchell made basketball history never done before for Cleveland\n\nCavs' Jarrett Allen is 2nd in NBA history to Wilt Chamberlain in unexpected stat\n\nDonovan Mitchell speaks on the dynamic he is building with new Cavs teammate James Harden\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers trade for Keon Ellis was literally 40 years in the making\n\nDaryl Morey throws shade at James Harden after his trade to Cavaliers",

    "fullText": "Cade Cunningham scored 33 points as the Detroit Pistons ended the Charlotte Hornets' nine-game winning streak on Monday with a stormy 110-104 victory overshadowed by a mass brawl that saw four players ejected.\n\nA bruising clash between the Eastern Conference-leading Pistons and the red-hot Hornets erupted into mayhem midway through the third quarter when Charlotte's Moussa Diabate fouled Detroit's Jalen Duren.\n\nDiabate and Duren went forehead-to-forehead, and Duren angrily shoved his opponent away with a hand to the face.\n\nThat was the cue for a melee that saw scuffles and punches being thrown all over the court.\n\nAfter a delay of several minutes, the officiating crew ejected Duren and Detroit team-mate Isaiah Stewart along with Charlotte pair Diabate and Miles Bridges.\n\nStewart had sprinted off the bench to join the fight, attempting to aim a blow at Bridges, who had thrown a punch at Duren as tempers flared.\n\nThere was a further flashpoint in the fourth quarter when Hornets head coach Charles Lee was ejected after reacting furiously at a foul given against his team.\n\nLee needed to be restrained by other members of the Charlotte coaching staff before being led off the court.\n\nLee later praised his team's performance after they went toe-to-toe with the Pistons for long periods of the contest.\n\n\"That was a freaking great game for us,\" Lee said. \"They are the number one team in the East and they bring a level of physicality and competitiveness to them.\n\n\"I think that overall our guys responded to every run that they went on, and all the physicality.\"\n\nAsked about the clash between Diabate and Duren that triggered the fight, Lee said: \"Two guys got in a heated conversation and then it kind of spiraled from there.\"\n\nOf his own ejection in the fourth quarter, Lee added: \"I gotta have a little bit better emotional control in that moment.\"\n\nDetroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff pinned the blame for the flashpoint squarely on Charlotte's players, saying Duren had been defending himself.\n\n\"Our guys deal with a lot right?\" Bickerstaff said. \"But they're not the ones that initiated it... they crossed the line.\n\n\"I hate that it got as ugly as it got. That's not something you ever want to see. But if a guy throws a punch at you, you have a responsibility to protect yourself and that's what happened tonight.\n\n\"Go back and watch the film. They're the ones that initiated crossing the line and our guy had to defend himself.\"\n\nDetroit's victory lifted them to 39-13 at the top of the Eastern Conference standings, clear of the second-placed New York Knicks (34-19). Charlotte remain in 10th place on 25-29.\n\nThere were more ejections elsewhere Monday, with the Minnesota Timberwolves' Naz Reid and Atlanta's Mo Gueye getting tossed during an ugly melee in the fourth quarter of their game, which ended in a 138-116 victory for Minnesota.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Oklahoma City Thunder improved to 41-13 with a 119-110 defeat of the Lakers. Jalen Williams led the scoring with 23 points for the reigning NBA champions, who were once again missing the injured Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nIn Denver, Donovan Mitchell finished with 32 points and James Harden added 22 as the Cleveland Cavaliers overcame a triple-double performance from Nikola Jokic to defeat the Nuggets 119-117.\n\nJokic finished with 22 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for Denver.\n\nThe Orlando Magic downed the Milwaukee Bucks 118-99 while the Utah Jazz upset the Miami Heat 115-111.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets (15-37) also scored an upset with a 123-115 defeat of the Chicago Bulls.",

It all happens the next two nights.\n\nA big sign outside of the BMO Center reads “Hockey Lives Here.” It certainly does with the IceHogs, but the Hockey that will live here the next two nights will be much different.\n\nThe AHL All-Star Classic will be held in Rockford for the first time. AHL league staff members have set up headquarters at the Embassy Suites just down the street.\n\nYou’ll notice All-Star banners on the streetlamps near the BMO.\n\nA large TV production truck sits alongside the BMO Center off Main Street. The event will be shown by the NHL Network and by TSN in Canada.\n\nTuesday afternoon starting a four o’clock some of the streets around the BMO will be filled with a block party. But inside is where the biggest action will take place.\n\n48 of the AHL’s best players will be in there. A skills competition will be held Tuesday night at seven o’clock. That will serve as the tune-up for Wednesday night’s All-Star Challenge, a series of six three-on-three round-robin games between the stars.\n\nThe IceHogs have high hopes for this event as IceHogs President of Business Operations told me a year ago when the IceHogs learned that they would host the event.\n\n“We know we’ve got a great fan base,” said Snider. “We know we’ve got a great community behind us. We’ll sell the tickets. We just want to make sure that we are doing the league right, making the city proud, making the community proud. We want to make this the best All-Star Game ever.”\n\nThe block parties Tuesday and Wednesday at 4pm are free to the public, so is the AHL’s Hall of Fame Induction ceremony at the Coronado Theatre Thursday morning at 11.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSuper Bowl-winning coach Gary Kubiak witnessed his son, Klint, offensive coordinator for the Seahawks, win the Super Bowl at Levi’s Stadium on Sunday like he did 10 years ago.\n\nAfter Seattle’s dominant victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl 60, Klint confirmed that he is taking the head coach job with the Las Vegas Raiders.\n\nHe was hired by his dad in Denver a little over a week after Gary led the Broncos to a victory in Super Bowl 50. It was Gary’s advice to his son that helped Seattle navigate the frenzy of the two weeks before the Super Bowl.\n\n“He said, ‘Put the game plan in a week early — don’t wait until you get there,'” Klint told The Denver Post, standing in the locker room Sunday night. “So we took his advice.”\n\n“Because when you get to the Super Bowl — there’s just so much stuff going on that it’s hard to, like, gameplan,” Klint continued. “You still keep game-planning, but there’s so many distractions. So we took his advice, and we dialed in the next week. And then we just kinda refined it when we got here.”\n\nMORE: Seahawks' Tyler Lockett added to Mattingly list after Super Bowl win\n\nThe Seahawks did install their offensive game plan on Thursday, Friday and Saturday of the pre-Super Bowl bye week, Klint told The Post. It was the same approach the San Francisco 49ers took when Klint was an assistant and Sam Darnold was a backup there in 2023.\n\n“Super Bowl throughout the week, like — the week leading up to the Super Bowl can be pretty hectic with media,” Darnold told The Post. “So you want to get as much of the game plan in the week before, so you can really focus on it and dive deep on it.”\n\nMORE: Most sacks in a Super Bowl: Where Seahawks' dominance against Drake Maye, Patriots ranks in NFL history\n\nThe Seahawks virtually dominated every aspect of the game. The defense finished as one of the all-time great squads in NFL history, while on offense, Seattle rode Kenneth Walker III to an MVP award. Darnold did enough to control time of possession and pace. He was 19-of-38 for 202 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks also didn’t turn over the ball.\n\n“I would do it 30 times over,” Klint said, on his father’s advice. “We didn’t have a great night on offense — our defense did great.

Chelsea cruised to a 3-0 half time lead against Wolves away from home on Saturday afternoon, but they stumbled a bit \n\nTwo penalties from Cole Palmer in quick succession and then a nice finish in open play within 25 minutes was enough to get that job done though and make the score line look comfortable.\n\nSutton thinks it’s going to be similar tonight.\n\nBBC pundit Chris Sutton with a Chelsea logo. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images)\n\nIn words picked up on X this week, Sutton says:\n\n“This game smells of Chelsea revenge to me. The Blues have made a good start under new boss Liam Rosenior, with four wins out of four in the league. Cole Palmer has hit form too, and they should win this fairly comfortably.”\n\nChelsea need to now focus on playing well across 90 minutes in games and not just one half. But a good start to this one will be important as you do not want to allow Leeds to build any confidence or momentum in the game and getting them believing they can do something here and grab all three points.\n\nLiam Rosenior will hope his incredible start at Chelsea can continue tonight.",

    "description": "Six months ago a win for Sunderland over the Premier League champions would have felt like pure fantasy, but on Wednesday we could actually do it, and go level on points with them. Let’s get stuck in!",
    "fullText": "Given that Sunderland are so very close to their points target from the start of the season, there’s a feeling — certainly from my perspective, anyway — that this game against Liverpool has slightly more riding on it than your usual Premier League outing.\n\nEvery time someone from within the club is asked about targets and achievable goals this season, there is a very clear and concise point made — all that we are focusing on and thinking about is reaching the magic forty-point mark. Right now we’re sat on 36, so we’re close, but we’re not quite there yet.\n\nThe fact that I’m even considering that we could get within touching distance of that with a win over Liverpool on Wednesday night is telling about how each club has performed this season. Arne Slot’s side, who were clearly the best team in the land last season and won the Premier League, are only three points ahead of us in the table. Victory on Wednesday night would put us level with the reigning Champions. An amazing thought.\n\nOf course, nothing is decided in February, and there’s a long way to go, but can you imagine what a win against such a brilliant side would do for our collective confidence heading into a much kinder-looking run of fixtures?\n\nThe daft thing is, I genuinely believe we can do it. Right now, Liverpool are a wounded animal, and they’ll still be hurting after losing to Manchester City on Sunday in a game they really ought to have gotten something from. Their talisman on that evening, Dominik Szoboszlai, is suspended, and there’s a glaring hole in the right-back position that Sunderland really ought to target and exploit. This is a great opportunity to earn a statement-making win over a side that I wouldn’t have dreamed of us beating six months ago.\n\nWe absolutely have to smell blood. Yes, Sunderland are the last remaining unbeaten Premier League home side, and with that comes the pressure to maintain our glittering spell of form, but you have to think that all the pressure is on Liverpool right now. They’ve got no chance of winning the league and retaining their title, but they’re in serious danger of completely blowing their season altogether. What if the unthinkable happens, and they fail to qualify for Europe? It may seem extreme, but it’s certainly possible, and these are the doubts that will be creeping into the minds of their players and coaching staff. I can’t imagine that after such a morale-sapping loss that they’ll be particularly looking forward to travelling up to the north-east on a Wednesday night to play against a team who has nothing to fear.\n\nMany supporters have quite rightly pointed out that there has been a change in the atmosphere at the Stadium of Light in our last two home games, but I just put that down to the fact that we were playing teams that we were expected to beat. That simply won’t be the case on Wednesday, and I think people will be really up for it against Liverpool, a side who may well not be at their best but are still expected to come and beat us. We thrive off being the underdog, and that brings with it a spirit that enables the fans to find an extra level or two, and should create the foundations for an atmosphere within the stadium that could well carry the players over the line to victory.\n\nEvery tackle, every header, every second ball — we must cheer it ferociously. The players have to do their part too and understand what a strong start early doors can do for how the rest of the game plays out from that point. When we win tackles or stick the ball into row Z for a throw-in, I want to see the Lads roaring towards the crowd and throwing up their arms — let’s make sure that Liverpool know that they’re in for a rough night.\n\nThen, who knows? We could be sat here on Thursday morning, proud as punch of yet another excellent Sunderland performance at the Stadium of Light, level on points with last season’s Champions and just one point away from our first huge target of the campaign.\n\nLet’s believe that we can achieve it. Let’s give them hell.",

    "title": "Will Sunderland Remain Unbeaten After Liverpool Clash?",
    "description": "How confident are you that Sunderland will get something on Wednesday and, importantly, maintain our unbeaten home record?",
    "fullText": "‘Doing a Sunderland’ — a ‘thing’ that a lot of people think exists, no longer is a ‘thing’ with this Sunderland side — that’s if it ever was. This is a new team, on a different level to probably any other team we’ve supported before. That being said, what still applies to us and every other team, is the level of psychology and the human effects on the players. I think RLB likes to term this as ‘consistency’. Only the very top teams can approach a game against a lower-league team with the same mentality that they approach a battle with a top-of-the-table rival. I don’t think we’ve reached those levels of consistency at all yet. Look at our away performances against Burnley, Fulham, Brentford and West Ham especially. We switched off. We didn’t give the home team the level of respect and commitment that needs to be given to all Premier teams.\n\nThe problem this Wednesday of course is that we’ve just given every effort against the league leaders, and left everything out on the pitch. But so did Liverpool against Man City. The Reds will be itching to put that right and get back to winning ways at the SoL. So it’s set up for a very intriguing game. I stated last week that I didn’t think we’d take points off Arsenal and Liverpool — especially as these 2 games are so close together. As well as we played at The Emirates, I think if we’d pinched a point, in some psychological throwback, we wouldn’t be approaching the Liverpool game with quite the same hunger or desire. Work that backwards logic out! Because we missed out against the Gunners, and as we are defending our brilliant home record, I think the players will be up for this one yet again, with a point to prove. Liverpool will have to be at it to take our undefeated record off us — bring it on. How we fare against Oxford might be another matter — but for Wednesday, I’m confident we can get something out of the game. Ha’way me bonnie lads!\n\nI think we have every chance of getting a positive result on Wednesday because we have everything to play for.\n\nWhile our Premier League status is not on the line this week, our proud unbeaten home record is something to fight for. Our players have a clear connection with the fans and this will be key to keeping Liverpool at bay.\n\nThe rousing atmosphere has been key in all of our home games so far, and I expect nothing less against a side which, despite a recent dip in form, are still the defending Premier League champions.\n\nWe should be looking to exploit the reds’ defensive woes and perhaps our substitutions later in the game will have an impact, with the likes of Mayenda, Isidor and our new signing Nilson offering us pace and power in reserve.\n\nOur home mentality and influence of the crowd will give our players that extra 10 per cent as we fight to keep our unbeaten run at the SoL going.\n\nLet’s not worry about the Arsenal game or our record away from home. We’re back at the SoL this time and our record at home should give Régis Le Bris and his team plenty of confidence. Ha’way the Lads!\n\nThis is clearly one of the biggest tests for us to maintain our unbeaten home record, but I think it’s feasible we can get a draw, and if we are at our best, we could do a bit better, as at our peak and with the crowd behind us, we can beat anyone at the SoL.\n\nThe concern I have is twofold. Firstly the proximity of these two top-end games, as was the issue with Man City and Liverpool close together in the past. We drew and almost nicked a win at Anfield, but the game at The Etihad was just too much too soon, and this pair of games could be similar.\n\nThe other risk is the personnel we have available after that massive battle against the champions elect. We have showed at home we can play without Xhaka, but the way Noah Sadiki went off at the weekend, if we have also lost him, that could be a tough one to overcome. Hopefully his withdrawal was a precaution and he is back to challenge the Liverpool midfield, part of a team that will be rattled by losing at home as they did in that last 15 mins against Pep’s lads.\n\nThat said, the early difference maker against Man City when they visited Liverpool was Szoboszlai, and after the farcical late red card he took, he will be suspended for our game, so we aren’t the only team without key players.\n\nIf we have Sadiki, Le Fée and Diarra in the middle we can more than compete with Mac Allister and Gravenberch for me.\n\nBrobbey supported by Talbi, Diarra and the interchanging overlap of Hume and Mukiele can get occasional change out of Konaté, Van Dijk and Kerkez. We may even see a bigger contribution from Angulo after a few more days to train and bed in.\n\nI feel sorry for whoever Liverpool draft in to replace the missing Hungarian in all honesty, as Brobbey will be on a mission, and so will the winger on that side I’m sure.\n\nIt will be a tough night, but it’s one I’m coming up for so I can’t wait to see it play out live.\n\nFor perspective, we have to remember this is why we wanted to be here — to pit our wits against some of the best footballers in the world.\n\nAnd to beat the sad bastards from Newcastle.\n\nA year ago, I was excited just to see how we’d fare against a beleaguered Luton after some sketchy home form. This year, the excitement is reaching ridiculous levels as we prepare to welcome the defending champions.\n\nWednesday against Liverpool presents a fascinating challenge. Our home form has been superb, built largely on Régis Le Bris’s (and now my) favourite word: synergy.\n\nIf we can turn the Stadium of Light into a genuine cauldron of noise, I’m certain the players will respond. With the right selection, a fully committed, physical performance, and relentless support, we can protect this unbeaten home record — something that clearly means a great deal to the squad and coaching staff alike. We’re coming off a grueling shift against Arsenal on Saturday, but there’s no doubt this team will leave everything on the pitch.\n\nWe can be under no illusions, though; Liverpool are dangerous for a reason. There’s a world-class clinical edge to them, and the duo of Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz is a particularly frightening prospect to nullify.\n\nHowever, if we look back to the reverse fixture along with our performances of late, there are plenty of encouraging signs. I’ve been beyond impressed with our midfield’s ability to dictate games, and we can’t dismiss the damage Brian Brobbey can do. His physicality, link-up play, and finishing could be the key to unlocking them.\n\nI’m not going to jinx the result with a score prediction, but I know I’ll leave the ground proud of this side. Let’s keep this run going. Ha’way the lads!\n\nI’d say that going into Wednesday night’s game I’m not confident that we WILL win but I’m confident that we CAN win.\n\nIf this season has shown us anything, it’s that we have no reason to fear anybody at the Stadium of Light. We’ve repelled the current top three in the league and taken 3 points while doing it, so welcoming a disheartened and seemingly flailing Liverpool side doesn’t put the fear into me like it may have before the season started.\n\nThanks to an unbelievable series of events against Manchester City, the holding league champions are down not one, two or three but four right-backs and will likely need to play Curtis Jones in that position — something which is particularly poignant for the visitors after missing out on our very own Lutsharel Geertruida.\n\nWith a stuttering Mo Salah, an injured Isak and an over-reliance on Ekitiké, we could find a way to keep the visitors from breaching our defence and I’d love to see our new lad Angulo given a start against their makeshift defence. He’s got the pace and trickery to make the night a nightmare for any player stepping into that spot.\n\nHopefully we can find a way to break through early as if we get an early goal, this Liverpool team is not made up of the same mentality monsters as in the past and may not be able to get back into it. We nearly won at Anfield so hopefully we can get the job done come Wednesday. Ha’way the lads!",

    "title": "When Advocacy Becomes Ammunition: How Eni Aluko’s Comments Undermine the Women’s Game",
    "description": "Eni Aluko is in the headlines again, and for all the wrong reasons. Do her comments undermine the progress that the women’s game has made over recent years?",
    "fullText": "Eni Aluko’s recent comments hit hardest those women who are already fighting to be heard. Her argument that male pundits are occupying spaces that should belong to women, and that she and other former players with many caps “deserve” those roles, has ignited a backlash not because the subject is off-limits, but because the way she framed it reinforces the very narratives that hold women back.\n\nWomen in sport should be able to disagree, debate, and critique without being painted as disloyal. But when someone with her platform speaks in ways that echo the language traditionally used to undermine women’s sport, the impact is not neutral. It reverberates. It gives ammunition to those who already believe women’s football is fragile, unserious, or undeserving of investment. And it shifts the conversation away from the structural issues that actually need attention.\n\nHer intentions may well be good. She may genuinely believe she is protecting the women’s game. But intention does not erase impact, and the impact here is harmful, especially for players, staff, journalists, and fans who are working relentlessly to build credibility in a landscape that still treats women’s sport as an afterthought. When someone with her influence speaks in ways that mirror the criticisms women already face, it adds weight to the wrong side of the scale. The frustration many women feel is not about disagreement. It’s about the way her comments feed into a wider culture that already demands perfection from women while excusing mediocrity in men. Women in sport are constantly told they must be grateful, quiet, and flawless. They must not complain, must not challenge, must not show vulnerability. They must work twice as hard to be taken half as seriously. And when someone from within the game reinforces those pressures, it becomes even harder to push back against them.\n\nEni Aluko speaks out about the Lionesses Euro 2025 final and the pundits for that game… pic.twitter.com/1vQcKyIZ0s\n\n— george (@StokeyyG2) February 7, 2026\n\nThis is where the damage lies. Not in the existence of critique, but in the way it is delivered, framed, and absorbed by an audience already predisposed to doubt women’s sport. Women’s football is still in a precarious position. It is growing, yes, but growth does not equal stability. Every misstep is magnified. Every controversy is weaponised. Every internal disagreement is treated as evidence that the sport is not ready for investment or attention. When Aluko speaks, she speaks as someone who has been a trailblazer, a former England international, a sporting director, a media figure. Her words carry authority. They shape narratives. They influence how the public, the press, and even decision-makers perceive the women’s game.\n\nHer comments about male pundits occupying space that she believes should belong to women deepen this harm. She argued that men, particularly high-profile ex-players, are taking roles in women’s football coverage that should be reserved for women with lived experience of the game. She went further by suggesting that her own international caps, and those of other retired female players, should entitle them to priority in punditry selection. This framing is flawed. It treats punditry as a zero-sum game rather than a growing space. It implies that men’s presence is inherently harmful, when in reality some of the most impactful advocacy for women’s football has come from male allies whose voices reach audiences women cannot yet reach.\n\nIan Wright is the clearest example. His support for the women’s game has been consistent, vocal, and deeply influential. He has used his platform to amplify women’s football at times when broadcasters barely acknowledged it. He has challenged misogyny within men’s football culture. He has championed female players and pundits. To publicly chastise him, as Aluko did, is not only unfair but strategically counterproductive. Allies matter. They matter because men listen to men. They matter because male fans are more receptive to male voices. They matter because the women’s game does not yet have the cultural power to stand alone without support from the wider football ecosystem.\n\nAlienating those allies does not empower women. It isolates them. And it hands misogynists exactly what they want: evidence, however flimsy, that women are ungrateful, divisive, or incapable of working collaboratively. Her comments have already been seized upon by individuals who were looking for a stick to beat women’s football with. They have been used to argue that women are entitled, that they want special treatment, that they cannot handle competition, that they resent male involvement. These narratives are not new. They are the same tired tropes that have been used to undermine women’s sport for decades. But when someone from within the game reinforces them, even unintentionally, they gain new life.\n\nThe emotional exhaustion of constantly having to defend women’s football from people who claim to support it is disheartening. It is draining to watch the same narratives resurface again and again. It is draining to see women blamed for structural problems they did not create. It is draining to see progress overshadowed by commentary that focuses on shortcomings rather than solutions. Women in sport are already doing the work. They are already pushing for better standards, better governance, better investment. They are already fighting for visibility and respect. They are already carrying the burden of proving themselves in a world that still doubts them.\n\nSo when someone with influence chooses to highlight problems in a way that lacks nuance or context, it feels like a betrayal, not because critique is unwelcome, but because it is delivered in a way that reinforces the very stereotypes women are trying to dismantle. There is a difference between constructive criticism and commentary that fuels existing biases. The former strengthens the game. The latter weakens it. Constructive criticism identifies problems while acknowledging context. It challenges systems rather than individuals. It recognises the structural barriers that shape outcomes. It pushes for improvement without undermining the legitimacy of the sport itself. Commentary that lacks this nuance does the opposite. It reinforces the idea that women’s sport is inherently flawed and women’s involvement in sport is tokenistic. It shifts responsibility away from institutions and onto individuals. It validates the scepticism of those who already doubt the women’s game. And it distracts from the real issues that need attention.\n\nAluko is not just another pundit. She is someone whose voice carries weight because of her history, her achievements, and her visibility. With that visibility comes responsibility. Not the responsibility to be silent, but the responsibility to be thoughtful. Women in sport do not need protection from criticism. They need protection from narratives that undermine their legitimacy. They need protection from commentary that reinforces the idea that they are the problem. They need protection from the same tired tropes that have been used to diminish them for decades. When Aluko speaks without acknowledging the structural context, she inadvertently strengthens those tropes. She shifts the focus away from the institutions that have failed women’s football and onto the women themselves. And that is where the harm lies.\n\nHer intentions may be rooted in wanting the game to improve. But improvement does not come from echoing the language of those who want the sport to fail. It does not come from demanding women be involved in men’s sports, but that the reverse cannot happen. It comes from challenging the systems that hold it back. It comes from amplifying the voices of those who are working tirelessly to build something better. It comes from recognising that women in sport are not the problem; they are the ones driving the solution.\n\nOne of the most insidious aspects of sexism in sport is the way it becomes internalised. Women are taught to be grateful for scraps. They are taught to accept criticism as the price of visibility. They are taught to believe that if the game is struggling, it must be their fault. When someone like Aluko reinforces these narratives, even unintentionally, it legitimises them. It makes it harder for women to push back. It makes it harder for them to demand better. And it makes it harder for the sport to grow in a healthy, sustainable way.\n\nWomen in football broadcasting such as Laura Woods, Alex Scott, Jules Breach, Emma Hayes, Eilidh Barbour, Reshmin Chowdhury, and Kate Abdo demonstrate exactly what excellence in punditry and presenting looks like. They are respected not because they are women, but because they bring authority, intelligence, and genuine football expertise to every broadcast. Their analysis is sharp, their delivery polished, and their understanding of the game deep and instinctive. Audiences value them because they elevate coverage through insight and professionalism, proving that women earn their place in football media through talent, credibility, and hard work, not entitlement. Their contributions enrich the sport and show what true representation looks like when it is built on merit.\n\nThe real barriers to women’s representation in punditry are not male allies. They are underinvestment in women’s broadcasting pathways, limited training and development opportunities, a lack of long-term career structures for female pundits, editorial decisions driven by audience metrics rather than equity, and institutional biases within media organisations. These are the issues that deserve attention. These are the issues that require advocacy. These are the issues that need to be challenged. But Aluko’s comments shift the focus away from these systemic problems and onto individuals, specifically male allies, who are not the cause of the inequality. Her comments appear to stem from a place of privilege, expectation and entitlement.\n\nThis misdirection is harmful because it allows institutions to avoid accountability. It allows broadcasters to continue underinvesting in women. It allows structural barriers to remain unchallenged. And it places the burden of progress on individuals rather than systems. Women’s football is at a pivotal moment. The growth is real, the talent is undeniable, and the appetite from fans is stronger than ever. But the foundations are still fragile. The structures are still uneven. And the respect is still conditional. In this context, commentary that reinforces old stereotypes does not help the game move forward. It pulls it back.\n\nThe women’s game is at a crucial point in its development, and every voice with a platform has the power to shape its trajectory. Eni Aluko’s frustrations about representation may be rooted in a desire for progress, but progress cannot be built on narratives that divide, alienate, or reinforce the very prejudices women are fighting against. Real change comes from challenging systems, not scapegoating allies; from expanding opportunities, not gatekeeping them; from strengthening solidarity, not fracturing it. Women’s football needs critique, ambition, and accountability, but it also needs unity, nuance, and an understanding that the fight for equality is bigger than any one individual. When commentary fuels misogynistic narratives rather than dismantling them, it becomes part of the problem. The women’s game deserves better than that, and the women within it deserve advocates who lift them up, not voices that inadvertently make their struggle harder.",

We’re a physical team and we’re built for it.”\n\nOur recap of the game be found here. Below is what Lloyd had to say postgame.\n\nLloyd on whether Arizona made any adjustments when it learned Darryn Peterson would be out: “Not really. Kansas has a lot of good players and a great coach. Playing them here, we knew it was going to be a dogfight, no matter which guys were wearing the Kansas Jayhawk jerseys. Obviously I’m sure they’re better with Peterson, but we felt like they were pretty good without him tonight as well.”\n\nOn Peterson not being listed on Kansas’ injury report: “I don’t even look at that, so no. I don’t even look at that to be honest with you. You guys can dig into that.”\n\nOn when he found out Peterson wouldn’t be playing: “10 minutes before the game. Guys, Kansas is a hell of a team. Let’s not make this about Darryn Peterson. He didn’t play because he was sick. They beat the number one team in the country at home tonight. They did a hell of a job, and their coach did a hell of a job that that should be the story.”\n\nOn Flory Bigunda’s defensive play and Arizona not finishing inside: “I wish he was guarding our guards. He really impacts the game at the rim. That game comes down to probably, if you have to start slicing and dicing and picking one or two things, and we didn’t finish at the rim well enough. And usually we’re really proficient at finishing at the rim. We’re getting fouled and it’s not very often we get out free throw’d, and it’s not very often we don’t make a higher percentage of our rim shots. So Kansas gets credit for that.”\n\nOn playing at Allen Fieldhouse: “It was awesome. Last year was really good. I don’t know how to compare the two. They’re both awesome. So awesome environment, and it makes it really difficult to play. And you guys need to know it does impact the game and and your fans deserve credit like that, just like our fans do at home when we’re playing in McKale.”\nTommy over here,\n\nOn what changed in the second half: “Nothing crazy, you know? I mean, I thought they kind of weathered a few runs by us, and then they kind of put their head down and really drove the ball got a lot of free throws. And then, Bidunga threw in a couple hooks, picked up a couple loose balls and was able to get to his jump hook and cashed them in. It it wasn’t like they weren’t making jump shots. I didn’t have to use anything. And then just in these games, they’re possession by possession, and they kind of made a run at the right time to get a little bit of a lead, and they did a good job managing, and did a great job making their free throws down the stretch.”\n\nOn Arizona struggling some in the paint: “Sometimes you come play in these hard environments in the Big 12 later in the season, and it’s fine. There’s no complaints. There’s going to be a lot that gets to go in the paint. The refs aren’t gonna guess, probably on both ends of the floor. So if you want to win these games, you got to deliver. You got to deliver when you get the ball inside, you got to be able to play through physical contact. You got to be able to be able to play through what you think are fouls, and you just got to keep it moving.”\n\nOn Arizona losing its first game: “Well, if a guy is 38-0 on his home court on Big Mondays, it’s probably pretty hard to win here, no matter what our record coming in is. So we knew it’s going to be a tough game, and we’re okay with it. Like guys, I’m not mad we lost. I can’t wait to get on that plane, get back home, and I feel like our season just started.”",

    "title": "Sunderland vs Liverpool: Dream Big At The Stadium Of Light",
    "description": "I’ll keep on dreaming until the dream is dead this season because, why the hell not?",
    "fullText": "Liverpool under the lights at the Stadium of Light is one of the games that we dreamt about when making the trek to Fleetwood, Accrington, and Burton just a few short years ago. The champions may be off the boil this season in terms of title credentials, but it’s still the sort of game it’s hard not to be excited for.\n\nOur underwhelming away form continued on Saturday, but in fairness, we far from disgraced ourselves at the Emirates, and Arsenal look set to win the title this year. We gave them a match for about an hour, and the second goal put the game beyond us. There’s a reason only one team has left that part of North London with all three points on just one occasion this season.\n\nAt the Stadium of Light, however, we are a different beast and are still unbeaten as February carries on. After a couple of draws, we’ve won back-to-back games at the SoL, scoring five goals in the process, which is a good start to our need to score more goals.\n\nWednesday night under the Wearside lights will be a tougher challenge than Crystal Palace or Burnley, but it feels as though Liverpool will far from relish coming to the SoL on their current run. A late defeat at home to Man City means they’ve won just one in seven before their trip across from Merseyside; no guesses as to who that one win was against.\n\nLiverpool have been far from their fluent best this season, and our 1-1 draw at Anfield could have been even better if certain chances had fallen our way. If feeling disappointed with a point away at the reigning Premier League champions isn’t a sign of how far we’ve come, then I don’t know what is.\n\nLiverpool at home is up there with welcoming Man Utd, Arsenal, and Chelsea in terms of feeling like we’re back in the Premier League. Our last home game against Liverpool was a rarity in that it was one of the few home games we didn’t lose during the 2016-17 season. Jermain Defoe scored two penalties in a 2-2 draw for the Lads, and the brief glimpse of hope came between a 4-1 loss at Burnley and then being turned over 3-1 at home to Stoke.\n\nIt’s easy to forget just how bad we were in that last Premier League season, but it’s important to remember that after finally shedding a lot of dead weight, both on and off the pitch, how much work has been needed to get to where we are now.\n\nLiverpool are still a colossus, one of the biggest and most widely supported teams in world football. However, we’ve shown in games against Arsenal, Chelsea, and Man City this season that we won’t roll over for any of the big boys, and we’ll give as good as we’ve got.\n\nThat 2-2 draw back in January 2017 was worth celebrating, as it was a point that gave some of us hope that we could put the fight in our relegation fight. A point this time around would keep us in the top half, whilst all three points would move us back firmly into the European places. I’ll keep on dreaming until the dream is dead this season because, why the hell not?",

    "title": "On This Day (10 Feb 1936): Sunderland Hero Jimmy Thorpe Is Laid To Rest",
    "description": "The streets of Jarrow were a mournful sight as crowds gathered to bid farewell to a shining star taken before his time",
    "fullText": "February 1936 was an emotional period for everybody connected with Sunderland AFC, and by the tenth of the month, it was time for everyone to pay their final respects to Jimmy Thorpe, the much-loved goalkeeper that had died the previous week following complications with injuries he’d suffered when playing for the Lads against Chelsea on the fifth.\n\nThorpe was a supremely gifted and extremely popular figure among teammates and supporters alike, and the tragic nature of his passing proved difficult to process. His funeral, which was attended by countless representatives of the game and members of the local community, showed just how much he was admired and missed, with people rallying to pay tribute to a young man that had been taken from his family much too soon.\n\nAlthough he’d been living in Cleadon with his wife May and son Ronnie, Thorpe was a Jarrow native.\n\nThe journey to Jarrow Cemetery began at May’s parents’ home on York Avenue in the Monkton area of the town and the cortege was observed by throngs of well-wishers that had lined the streets — many of whom had walked from Sunderland to be present. Although impeccably behaved, the numbers there meant police officers often had to hold back mourners to enable the procession to continue.\n\nOnce the invited attendees had reached the cemetery, the gates were locked so that the burial could be carried out in solitude.\n\nThe curate of Jarrow, Rev. Brittian, led proceedings before Thorpe’s oak casket was lowered into the ground next to a quiet spot by a tree; the pallbearers being his teammates Bobby Gurney, Alex Hastings, Bert Johnston, Harry Shaw, Billy Murray and fellow goalkeeper Matt Middleton.\n\nAlongside the current playing staff, many former players were attendance, as well as a raft of coaching and administration staff, with a slew of over one hundred names being listed in later editions of that days’s Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette.\n\nNumerous floral tributes were also sent, including one designed by manager/secretary Johnny Cochrane that depicted a football field inside a six-inch border (green to match Thorpe’s jersey) and a full-sized ball made from brown leaves that was placed in front of an empty goal-shaped wreath.\n\nSunderland Borough Police and Fire Brigade, the Sunderland players and staff, the Sunderland directors, the Roker Park gatemen, Ald FW Taylor, Chelsea, Hartlepools United, Newcastle United players officials and staff, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth, West Ham United, Everton, the Jarrow Junior Imperial League, and Jarrow AFC officials and players were amongst those also reported to have sent flowers — alongside various supporter groups.\n\nThe sheer volume of mourners, officials and tributes spoke to how popular a character Thorpe was, and how hard his death had hit the community.\n\nFor once, results and form seemed insignificant, as the focus in the region shifted away from the football and towards one of the people that made the game so special. Ninety years on from his funeral, we hope that Jimmy is still resting in peace.\n\n*The following is an abridged version of attendees as listed by the Echo, recreated now to underline Thorpe’s status, and the significance of his passing.\n\nFamily: J.H.A Thorpe (father), G.Lockhart (father-in-law), A.Thorpe (uncle), G.Maughan (uncle), E and A.

    "description": "Since October 2024, Frank Ilett has refused to cut his hair until Manchester United win five games in row – now, the end of this viral challenge and absurd look is finally in sight",
    "fullText": "“Do it for Frank” is unlikely to form part of Michael Carrick’s team talk as Manchester United head to West Ham this evening. But perhaps it should. It is clear that when fan Frank Ilett vowed not to cut his hair until his team had won five games in a row, he did not expect to be approaching 500 days without stepping into a barber’s, or for his look to have grown quite so ridiculous, or to have accumulated more social media followers than some Manchester United first-team players. After four consecutive wins, though, he is extremely close to his self-inflicted ordeal finally being over.\n\nIlett’s challenge began on 5 October 2024 and amid the club’s worst-ever start to a Premier League season. It was a bit of a joke, the 29-year-old said, with the hope of “spreading some humour and positivity” and helping the club’s supporters get through the “dark days” – United had saved a wretched season the year before by winning the FA Cup, but it was clear all was not well. By the end of the month, manager Erik ten Hag had been sacked and the promise of the smiling Ruben Amorim arrived. At the time, the idea of a rejuvenated United going on a run was hardly inconceivable, but then the nosedive started. Under Amorim, United stumbled through the rest of a doomed campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final.\n\nI never expected to still be growing my hair, a year on 😳\n\nI hope I've made you smile on some of these dark days and hope that soon, we'll all be smiling together at the results! 🤞\n\nI don't think we're as far away from winning ways as it seems.. 🙏#manunited #hairchallenge pic.twitter.com/5hRnBnNAlX\n\n— TheUnitedStrand (@TheUnitedStrand) October 6, 2025\n\nAs the losses mounted and United’s slide worsened, Ilett’s hair ballooned and the size of his audience did too. His various ‘The United Strand’ accounts, across Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, gained hundreds of thousands of followers, with his daily updates accumulating millions of views. At the centre of each video was, of course, the hair, which with each passing month not only grew longer but became more ridiculous, expanding outwards in every direction, bobbing on top of his head and hovering around the back of his neck like a thick shrub of floating gas. United’s dismal end of the season consigned Ilett to a whole summer beneath this absurd, dense, bushy cloud. That the Oxford-born Ilett now lives in sunny Spain added to the weight he was under.\n\nThroughout it all, Ilett has remained positively upbeat and endlessly optimistic that United’s fortunes could turn. In doing so, he has also raised money for the mental health charity Mind and, when he surpassed his previous fundraising target, the Little Princess Trust; when Ilett is eventually sheared, his locks will be donated and turned into wigs for young cancer patients dealing with hair loss. Even as United have been so woeful, this has, at least, been an entertaining sideshow. While it has been as notorious in this particular spell of the club’s steady decline as Old Trafford’s leaky roof, Amorim’s 3-4-2-1, big Sir Jim’s cuts and Roy Keane’s rants – it is one that will, in the end, bring some good into the world.\n\nAnd yet, for some, Ilett’s hair is an overgrown reminder of the depths United have fallen to, and a case study into the often divisive impact of the viral online fan/content creator. It was the toxic atmosphere that consumed the final years of Arsene Wenger’s legendary reign at Arsenal, for example, that proved fertile ground for the growth of Arsenal Fan TV. Back then, a fuming post-match monologue outside the Emirates following the club’s latest heavy defeat to Bayern Munich would be guaranteed to slap, racking up millions of views across digital platforms. As content, AFTV was an unbelievable success. But to the loyal, match-going supporter, AFTV were accused of gleefully feeding on the embarrassment and eating up the hits. Arsenal are far from the only Premier League club to have experienced this split between factions.\n\nIlett has not yet required a police escort when leaving away grounds, or had Old Trafford collectively chant “get out of our club” for inadvertently highlighting their shortcomings. But that is not to say his challenge has not been without incident. In September, a grim clip of Ilett being assaulted in the concourse while attending United's home match against Chelsea was widely shared online - with his hair grabbed and forcefully yanked downwards by another supporter, who was later banned from Old Trafford. Ilett told the Manchester Evening News that he had been called an “attention-seeking c**t” but reported that 99 per cent of all other reactions were positive. Since then, his following on Instagram has tripled from almost 400,000 to over 1.2m and thankfully, perhaps for everyone, the end is in sight.\n\nAs head coach, Amorim said he hoped United would find the form for Ilett to get his hair cut as soon as possible. Yet it was the Portuguese’s departure in early January that proved to be the turning point: with Michael Carrick at the wheel, United have beaten Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham in consecutive games and head to West Ham tonight bidding for five wins in a row. It will have been 493 days since Ilett began his challenge and the excitement is palpable: Carrick’s teenage children, naturally, are followers and have made sure their dad is aware. He joked he would not put undue pressure on his players by letting them know what is on the line at the London Stadium, although they too have been peppered with questions about Ilett whenever they win a couple of games in a row.\n\n“I can understand what’s going on with it and it does make me smile, but it won’t have an impact,” Carrick maintained. A win for United would continue their resurgence and march towards a return to the Champions League; for Ilett, it will bring the end of a light-hearted stunt that has, in more ways than one, grown out of control. He will have his five minutes of fame. He will give the same interview on his round of breakfast TV couches. Someone will have paid an inordinate amount for the money shot of the barber’s clippers running through the tangled mess, and Ilett will feel a whole lot lighter.\n\nWhat does this all say about the sense of entitlement that appears to be seeping into modern-day fandom? Perhaps it will inspire copycats: a Liverpool fan from Southend on hunger strike until they sign a defender, a Tottenham supporter in Cork handcuffing themselves to a park bench until Thomas Frank is sacked. But ultimately, if all goes to plan, the winners will be United, and the players who would no longer have to be reminded of their part in this woeful chapter.",

    "fullText": "The American short-track speed skating team will look to get back on the podium at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics after being shutout at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.\n\nEight short-track speeders will represent Team USA in Milano Cortina, including five returning Olympians (Kristen Santos-Griswold, Corinne Stoddard, Julie Letai, Eunice Lee and Andrew Heo) and three first-timers (Kamryn Lute, Brandon Kim and Clayton DeClemente). The U.S. has won 20 Olympic medals in short-track speed skating, most recently John-Henry Krueger's silver in the 1000m at the 2018 PyeongChang Games.\n\nShort-track speed skating was staged as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Calgary Winter Games and officially made its Olympic debut at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games. The 2000m mixed team relay was added to the program at the 2022 Beijing Games.\n\nUnlike speed skating, where athletes race against the clock, short-track speed skating pits racers against each other, highlighting the importance of strategy in this event. Short-track speed skating, takes place on a shorter track (111.12 meters long) like the name suggests, compared to a speed skating track (400 meters long).\n\nThere will be nine short-track speed skating medal events in Milano Cortina:\n\n2000m mixed team relay: Each team consists of two women and two men.\n\nKristen Santos-Griswol: Santos-Griswold was in medal contention in the 1000m race at the 2022 Beijing Olympics when she was bumped by an opponent and fell. She finished just off the podium in fourth place and contemplated retirement. Santos-Griswol, 31, came back strong and won five medals at the 2024 World Championships, including a 1000m gold, to become the first U.S. skater to win medals at three individual distances (500m, 1,000m, 1,500m) at one world competition. She won her first Crystal Globe for the 2024-25 season, which is awarded to the best overall skater.\n\nCorinne Stoddard: The 24-year-old is looking to improve upon her seventh-place finish in the 1000m race at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Stoddard won three medals at the 2024 World Championships and finished the 2025-26 World Tour second overall after winning eight individual medals (3 silver, 5 bronze).\n\nSantos-Griswol and Stoddard will look to dethrone Italian Arianna Fontana, who's set to compete in her sixth Olympics. Fontana has 11 Olympic medals to her name, including back-to-back golds in the 500m. Don't count out South Korea, which leads all countries with 53 total short-track speed skating Olympic medals and 26 gold.\n\nThe 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics are here! \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Short-track speed skating at 2026 Milano Cortina: US stars to watch",

    "fullText": "The winter transfer window has been and gone, with a raft of new arrivals landing in the Kingdom ready to begin their Roshn Saudi League journey.\n\nWhat’s noticeable once more is our clubs' collective preference to look for players of a younger age profile, as the dynamic around signing players changes with an eye on the future.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some of the RSL's fresh faces to keep an eye on for the remainder of the season.\n\nAl Hilal seem to have struck gold with the signing of the highly rated 18-year-old forward from Rennes.\n\nAmid the drama of the final days of the transfer window, Meite’s signing almost slipped under the radar, but it hasn’t gone unnoticed around the world given the striker was recently linked with a move to English giants Manchester United.\n\nConsidered a star of the future for the French national team, he’ll get invaluable tutelage working alongside compatriot, and fellow new addition, Karim Benzema.\n\nFrom one young French sensation to another, the RSL champions will be buoyed by the capture of the 19-year-old forward who, despite his tender age, has already racked up more than 100 appearances across stints with Amiens, Antwerp and AS Monaco. As such, a switch to Lille this window was mooted.\n\nMaking his debut in the Coupe de France aged only 16 years, Ilenikhena scored five goals in 38 appearances for AS Monaco across the past season and a half and, in 2023, was named on The Guardian’s “Next Generation” list of best young talents in world football.\n\nAl Kholood were busy in the winter transfer window as they sought to strengthen the side to further their push for survival. And the 25-year-old Spaniard, who most recently played in La Liga 2 with SD Huesca, looks one of the more interesting recruits.\n\nGiven Al Kholood’s connection to Spanish football through pioneering owner Ben Harburg, who also boasts in his portfolio La Liga 2 side Cadiz, there would be a keen understanding of the Spanish market, especially its second division.\n\nWith that in mind, Al Kholood would’ve no doubt seen Kortajarena up close this season. Therefore, they’ll be fully aware of what the attacking midfielder can bring to the table.\n\nWith six of their foreign contingent coming from South America, Al Taawoun have thought outside that particular box with the acquisition of the 22-year-old Bulgarian international striker.\n\nCapped more than 20 times for his country, Petkov was the joint-top scorer for Levski Sofia last season as they finished second in his homeland’s lead division, and his seven goals already this season helped the club to top spot in the table.\n\nWith Al Taawoun in a bit of a rut at the moment, Petkov could be just what they need to rediscover their mojo as Pericles Chamusca's aspiring side look to secure a top-five finish.\n\nIt wasn’t only foreign stars arriving in the RSL; one of the country’s most promising youngsters also returned after time spent in Europe with both Dunkerque in France and Lausanne-Sport in Switzerland.\n\nAl Saad is not a new addition at NEOM SC having joined in 2024 when they were in the second tier but, having been on loan in recent times, his comeback will feel like a new signing for Christophe Galtier’s men.\n\nHugely ambitious, the promoted club could do with a spark to resuscitate their debut-campaign's objectives. For that, Al Saad’s comeback could prove very timely, indeed.\n\nAl Riyadh were another club busy in the market, with a handful of fresh additions to their squad. And, given their predicament this season, it’s easy to understand why.\n\nWhat the capital club require, as they try to navigate a way to safety, are experienced heads and, in Algerian international Victor Lekhal, they might have found just that.\n\nAged 31, the French-born midfielder has built more than 200 games’ worth of pro knowhow featuring for Le Habre in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. Also, he understands the region having most recently played in Qatar with Umm Salal and Kuwait with Qadsia SC.\n\nAl Riyadh signed experienced midfielder Victor Lekhal to bolster their fight for survival\n\nThe 21-year-old has been on the fringes of the Jordanian national team for a while now, but finally got his chance to impress when he made his debut against Mali in November.\n\nAzaizeh backed that up with a star showing at the recent AFC Under-23 Asian Cup, finishing joint-top scorer with four goals, which included a brace against Saudi Arabia that no doubt put him on the radar of clubs in the RSL.\n\nWith the 2026 FIFA World Cup on the horizon, a good showing for Al Shabab could put Azaizeh on the plane to North America.\n\nOnly a year ago, the Cameroon international was playing in La Liga for Getafe against the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid, while he also has developed big-game experience in Ligue 1 with Saint-Etienne and in representing his country at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThat type of elite-level education, principally promoting a calm head when things don’t go your way, could be exactly what Al Okhdood require in the remaining matches as the second-from-bottom club try to dig their way out of the relegation zone.",

    "fullText": "LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — The Kansas climb picked up more steam Monday night as the No. 9 Jayhawks knocked off top-ranked Arizona 82-78.\n\nLess than a month after falling out of The Associated Press Top 25, Kansas (19-5, 9-2 Big 12) has won eight in a row and clawed its way back into Big 12 title contention, trailing previously unbeaten Arizona (23-1, 10-1) by one game. Houston is currently in second, a half-game ahead of Kansas. The third-ranked Cougars face Utah on Tuesday night.\n\n“We couldn’t lose this game,” senior guard Melvin Council Jr. said after knocking off Arizona. “We were just ready and prepared and we knew it was going to be a long game with a bunch of runs.”\n\nKansas trailed by as many as 11 points in the game and did not hold a lead until the clock read 9:32 in the second half. Four Jayhawks finished in double figures, led by Flory Bidunga and Council Jr, who scored 23 points apiece. Bidunga also grabbed 10 rebounds.\n\nThe Jayhawks played without freshman standout Darryn Peterson, who was experiencing flu-like symptoms and missed the game. Self revealed after the game that Peterson had missed practice on Sunday and didn’t know until about a half hour before the game that he would be unavailable. Despite missing 11 games, Peterson leads the Jayhawks in scoring, averaging 20.5 points.\n\n“A lot of teams, this time of year, when you get to early February, they know where their ceiling is, and the great teams are operating pretty close to their ceiling, Kansas coach Bill Self said. “I don’t know where our ceiling is, and I know that we’re not close to it yet, though.”\n\nThe victory ended a 23-game winning streak for Arizona. It was the second-longest streak in Division I men’s basketball behind Miami (Ohio), which has won 24 straight.\n\nWith the win, Kansas improved to 2-2 against top-10 opponents this season. It was also the Jayhawks’ first win against the AP’s top-ranked team at Allen Fieldhouse.\n\n“Kansas is a hell of a team,” Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said after the game. “They beat the No. 1 team in the country at home tonight. They did a hell of a job and their coach did a hell of a job.”\n\nFour Jayhawks finished the game in double figures, with Bryson Tiller scoring 18 and Jamari McDowell adding 10.\n\nBrayden Burries led all scorers with 25 points for Arizona. Teammate Motiejus Krivas recorded a double-double with 14 points and 15 rebounds, and Ivan Kharchenkov scored 13.\n\nGet poll alerts and updates on the AP Top 25 throughout the season.

    "title": "WWE Raw - 2/9/2026: 3 Things We Loved And 3 We Hated",
    "description": "The best and the worst of the February 9 edition of \"WWE Raw\"",
    "fullText": "The card for Elimination Chamber is starting to come into sharper focus after another edition of \"WWE Raw.\" The show was full of table-setting for the company's upcoming trip to Chicago, with two title matches made, and two more Elimination Chamber competitors determined. But enough about what happened, that's been handled by the results page.\n\nInstead, it's time to talk about the euphoric highs and pitiful lows of Monday's show. There was plenty to love, like the opening bickering between AJ Lee and Becky Lynch, or the fact that Adam Pearce has never had a good night in his entire history as GM. There was also plenty to hate, like the weird, unfocused segments that existed to simply stretch out the road to WrestleMania.\n\nEnough of my bloviating, let's break down the good and the bad from Monday's edition of the WWE flagship.\n\nAdam Pearce has not had a single good Monday since he became general manager of \"Raw.\" It has become something of an entertaining lodestar for my weekly catch up.\n\nPearce is something of a pain sponge, meant to take as much verbal, physical, psychological, and emotional abuse as the \"Raw\" locker room can throw at him, and he does a damn good job doing it. Pearce looked ridiculous in several segments tonight, including the one where he seemed to suggest that Finn Balor winning the World Heavyweight Championship would be beneath the WrestleMania main event, and each time, his tortured expression had me cackling. He would've been a tremendous silent film star.\n\nNick Aldis is a little too cool a customer, and \"NXT\" is so chaotic that neither Ava nor interim GM Robert Stone ever quite come across as the middle-management clown that Pearce does every week. It's a thankless job to be the bumbling GM of a goofy wrestling show, but I'm here to correct that, and give the former NWA Worlds Heavyweight Champion his due and proper.\n\nI am all for having WWE stars take part in more than one storyline at a time, but I also feel like there's a time and a place for that to happen. Jey Uso taking part in the Men's Elimination Chamber Triple Threat Qualifier matches is not one of those times where I feel like it's a good idea to have someone to have their hand in more than one pot at a time.\n\nNow, I feel like it's important to quickly acknowledge that Jimmy Uso has reportedly been dealing with some personal matters, and that could be a major factor regarding the pivot for Jey back into singles competition for the time being. With that said, considering that this edition of \"Raw\" was the first time that The Usos have ever defended the World Tag Team Championship since winning them all the way back on December 29 against Alpha Academy, it should go without saying that all storylines that Jimmy and Jey are involved in as of right now somehow connect to the \"Raw\" tag team division and the World Tag Team Championship. It makes absolutely no sense to have Jey revert back to a singles competitor in order for him to compete in a Men's Elimination Chamber Triple Threat Qualifier and presumably the Men's Elimination Chamber Match itself (since it would be so odd to put him in a qualifier otherwise). The \"Raw\" men's division has absolutely no shortage of other talent who WWE could slot into Jey's place instead, including names like Je'Von Evans or Dominik Mysterio, who could benefit from being involved in the more serious storyline that Elimination Chamber would provide for them. Moreover, Jimmy encouraging Jey to take part in the Triple Threat Qualifier feels strange to me, as one would think that he would be more focused on the World Tag Team Championship and defending it. The entire thing feels like such a random decision, and a move that makes absolutely no sense to me at all.\n\nLast Monday, Liv Morgan seemed to choose Stephanie Vaquer as her WrestleMania opponent when she attacked Vaquer following her match and held Vaquer's title in the air. Then she showed up on SmackDown, and Jade Cargill told her she'd beat her a** at \"The Show of Shows\" if she chose her.\n\nTonight, after receiving roses and chocolate from \"Dirty Dom\" in the ring, Morgan said that both Vaquer and Cargill are afraid to face her because whoever she chooses will lose their title to her. Right on cue, Vaquer came to the ring and told Morgan she spoke too much. Then she set her sights on Mysterio, and they conversed in Spanish. When Morgan asked him to translate, he refused. The exchange between Vaquer and Mysterio was different than what we typically see. At such a divisive time in this country and on the heels of a Super Bowl halftime show that was almost completely in Spanish, it was cool to have this exchange. Mysterio added to it by refusing to translate. Vaquer claimed that Mysterio called Morgan a \"b****\". Morgan called her a liar and a p*** before Mysterio ended up getting slapped by Vaquer.\n\nMorgan said she isn't rushing to take her time. Whomever she chooses, there will be time to build up a story, assuming Morgan doesn't take too long. WWE is currently focused on hyping CM Punk vs. Roman Reigns as potentially one of the \"greatest WrestleMania main events of all time\", so giving Morgan time to make a choice is smart. It also makes both the Women's Championship and Women's World Championship look equally important. When Morgan finally decides, it will hopefully make the decision and the match more impactful.\n\nI've never been a fan of El Grande Americano, ever since the bit came about while Chad Gable was feuding with luchadors.\n\nI didn't like the \"character\" then, I didn't like it when another EGA popped up while Gable was doing the shtick, I didn't like it when Ludwig Kaiser was then boxed into the EGA role while Gable was out injured, and I certainly didn't like it when WWE decided to throw more Americanos into the mix in the form of Tyler Bate and Pete Dunne.\n\nObviously, WWE cannot book exclusively to my liking. But I do get to complain about it here, so read on if you disagree, because chances are I am not going to convince you otherwise. Still here? Okay, wel,l let me at least rationalize it.\n\nThis week's \"WWE Raw\" saw Je'Von Evans teaming up with TBC to take on Los Americanos, with EGA Kaiser standing at ringside. TBC wound up being the returning OG EGA – Gable, who, of course, entered the Royal Rumble, which was too full for Finn Balor, so he could eliminate EGA Kaiser.\n\nBut before we could get to the graps, Los Americanos cut a promo to the crowd, and I will concede that at the very least Kaiser knows how to speak Spanish, while the other two just spoke in a stereotypical accent, ensuring to roll every 'R' and turn every 'Y' into a 'J.'\n\nIt feels somewhat obvious to say that there is absolutely no need for Kaiser, a German, Bate and Dunne, Britons, and Gable, from the US, to impersonate luchadors when there are legitimate luchadors scattered across the promotion. Once more, the issue is not that they are wearing a mask. The issue is not that they are performing as characters. The issue is that there is a conceited effort to parody lucha libre and Latin people in the most tasteless, dregs-of-the-barrel way.\n\nWhen we did get to the match, Evans took a backseat to the OG EGA as he got the winning pin – albeit after a really impressive cutter – and then had a little tussle with EGA Kaiser in obvious promotion for an eventual Mask vs. Mask match.\n\nThe match wasn't bad because it was Evans, Kaiser, Gable, Bate, and Dunne wrestling. But the story, if one could be so bold as to call it that, sucked all the way to the core.\n\nOne may say not to see it as a political thing, but I would say that while the head of creative stands next to a President open in his contempt for the people being parodied on WWE programming, it's impossible not to see it that way.\n\nI know many fans expected the return of AJ Lee during the women's Royal Rumble to kick off her reported WrestleMania 42 program with Becky Lynch, and thankfully, after Lee didn't seem to make the trip to Saudi Arabia, we got that tonight. Despite not liking Lynch's current character at all (I cannot stress enough how much I absolutely hate this gimmick, and I'll leave it at that), I liked how this played out tonight, from the very beginning.\n\nLee's return tonight on \"Raw\" was a surprise, as I didn't see it reported anywhere. She popped up beside her husband, CM Punk, during his entrance to the arena, and very shortly after, incensed Lynch popped into frame, which I thought was cute. Then, Lynch opened up the show, interrupting Corey Graves' opening spiel, because she was so angry about Lee being back.\n\nAnd, thankfully, in my case, with hating having to hear this character speak, Lee interrupted her very quickly. Lee went out about how she didn't think she ruined Lynch's life, then of course spouted off everything that's been happening since she made her tap out at Wrestlepalooza, from beating her in WarGames to costing her the Women's Intercontinental Championship once before. It all made Lynch crash out, and the back-and-forth between the women was pretty good before they finally came to the agreement that they'd face off one-on-one for the title at Elimination Chamber.\n\nI liked Lee standing her ground that she wouldn't be having her first singles match in over ten years, which was an important fact to bring up to remind fans, for anything less than the title. I also expected this to happen at WrestleMania, and while I still expect this program to go until \"The Showcase of the Immortals,\" I think Lynch's first defense against Lee happening in Chicago is the way to go. Lee might even win there, making Lynch's crash out all the more insane, and they take it through to 'Mania with the gold on Lee. Lynch's further descent into madness could even spark some more fun comments and promos about mental health from Lee, which I, and the crowd, enjoyed last time.\n\nNo matter how you book things moving forward, I was just glad things kicked off tonight between them. Lee may be the only thing that makes Lynch's act tolerable, to me at least, and it was good to see her back.\n\nI was really hoping tonight that WWE would establish Natalya's \"Nattie\" character hot right out of the gate, which, of course, was wishful thinking. What we got was pretty lame, if not a completely confusing mess. Sure, we saw the Nattie character for the first time, complete with new, \"Killing in the Name\" Rage Against The Machine-inspired music, in the women's Royal Rumble, but tonight was kind of a big deal, as it was her first singles match portraying the new, more fierce character.\n\nNattie faced off against Maxxine Dupri, and while there was at least some kind of story there for the match to make sense, Dupri isn't exactly a formidable opponent. It would have done Nattie well to have just squashed her. WWE must have more planned for Dupri following her forgettable reign with the Women's Intercontinental Championship, because I can't think of another reason as to why this match would have ended this way, other than to bring in the other women involved in the post-match angle.\n\nRather than take out Dupri in the middle of the ring, Nattie seemed to snap after dodging the Ankle Lock and some of Dupri's offense, and cleared the commentary desk. She laid out Dupri on the table and started beating her down, not caring at all about the referee's 10 count. I did at least like the fact that they continued the story with AJ Lee and Dupri, as it was Lee who helped Dupri win the Women's Intercontinental Championship from Becky Lynch in the first place. She ran down to help, which drove Nattie off, which was confusing, as she's supposed to be a big, strong bada**, and then Lynch ran down to take out Lee, which further removed Nattie from the center of this all. Which, again, made little sense, as she also has a possible story right there with Lynch, whom she eliminated from the Rumble.\n\nThe match felt more like a vehicle for Lee and Lynch by the end of it. Thankfully, Nattie was at least announced for an Elimination Chamber qualifying match next week, and she'll go up against Bayley and Asuka. I actually, somehow, have some faith in her, mostly because I think Bayley and Asuka might take one another out if Dupri stays out of the mix, but I still really wish Nattie would have had a stronger showing tonight. With all of WWE's questionable booking decisions and reported changes to many things on \"The Road to WrestleMania,\" this may be minor, but it still stuck out to me, and I hate this for Natalya.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "description": "The Lakers had six players score in double figures, but it wasn't enough against the Oklahoma City Thunder.",
    "fullText": "In the eyes of Lakers coach JJ Redick, every team his group faces is a test. Still, many wondered if the Lakers’ litmus test would come from facing the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night.\n\nEven with All-Star and league most valuable player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander out with a strained abdominal, the Thunder are still a problem for most of the league. And the Lakers had to play OKC with their own MVP candidate, Luka Doncic, sitting out for the second straight game with a left hamstring strain.\n\nIn the end, the Thunder had seven players score in double figures and pulled out a 119-110 win over the Lakers at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers (32-19) had six players score in double figures, but it wasn’t enough.\n\nLeBron James had 22 points, 10 assists and six rebounds, Marcus Smart had 19 points, Austin Reaves 16 off the bench, Jake LaRavia 14 and Rui Hachimura and Jaxon Hayes both had 12 points.\n\nReaves gave the Lakers a 99-98 lead on a drive to the basket in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Thunder just kept coming back, taking a 109-101 lead by outscoring the Lakers 11-2.\n\nThe Lakers, too, kept fighting back, getting to within 113-110 on a Hachimura basket.\n\nBut Jalen Williams, who had 23 points in his return to the lineup, kept scoring for the Thunder, making a field goal, two free throws with 35.9 seconds left and two more with 20.9 seconds left that sealed the game.\n\nReaves provided the fans with a big-time highlight, driving down the lane and throwing down a two-handed dunk on Jaylin Williams and Aaron Wiggins to end the first quarter.\n\nThe Lakers had 20 turnovers the last time they played at Oklahoma City in a game L.A. got down by as much as 37 points before losing by 29.\n\nSo, one point of emphasis for the Lakers was taking care of the basketball and then playing a high level of basketball despite the opponent.\n\n“For our group, it felt like it's good to see where we're at every single night,” Redick said.\n\nHis team spent the entire first half climbing out of a hole.\n\nThe Lakers were down by just one at the end of the first quarter, but quickly got down 52-38 early in the second quarter.\n\nBut behind a James dunk over Chet Holmgren, the Lakers got to within two points in the second, drawing cheers from the fans.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t keep up that momentum, going down 67-58 at the half.\n\nThen in the third quarter, the Lakers got rolling and opened an eight-point lead behind a strong defense and good offense.\n\nBut again, the Thunder didn’t stop playing hard, coming back to open a 93-91 lead at the end of the third quarter on an Alex Caruso three-pointer.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "fullText": "JJ Redick admits he and the Lakers failed LeBron James in their latest loss to the Thunder originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers were playing well against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night, but they could not beat the defending champions. OKC won 119-110, an impressive result for the Lakers given Luka Doncic's absence.\n\nLeBron James led the way for the Lakers with a decent line of 22 points, six rebounds, and 10 assists. His highest-scoring teammate was Marcus Smart, who had 19, while Austin Reaves had 16.\n\nFor the first three quarters, James was playing quite well. The offense was running through him, as he was scoring and making some big-time plays.\n\nUnfortunately, that faded away in the fourth quarter, as the Lakers were quite passive. Considering James was the driving force for the first three quarters, not giving him touches was the biggest mistake the Lakers made during the game.\n\nMORE: LeBron James gets honest on the best quality he wants to see from other basketball players\n\nAfter the game, Redick was pleased with the team's effort, but their execution was lacking. Considering their best player was out injured, they had to rely on James and Reaves, who just returned to the active lineup recently.\n\nThat should have meant that James would get the most touches to maximize his good performance. Unfortunately, Redick and the Lakers did not get James his deserved touches much in crunch time.\n\n\"I don’t think we did a good job on getting LeBron ball. Some of that was that we called the plays, but we didn’t execute. Some of that was just not having the recognition,\" Redick said in his post-game interview.\n\n\"Him playing against smaller players was how we got back in the game. And we didn’t do a good job of getting him the ball.\"\n\nIn the long run, the Lakers should know which player they can rely on to carry them. Doncic has been the obvious choice for the most part, but James is still a huge star despite his age. Relying on him should be normal for the Lakers.\n\nLakers now know the asking price for Giannis Antetokounmpo trade\n\nDid Bad Bunny diss Lakers' LeBron James during Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nRob Pelinka's reasoning for Lakers' disappointing trade season should enrage fans\n\nLeBron James haters are sharing a wild AI video of him knocking out Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry and more NBA legends\n\nLakers urged to pair Luka Doncic with 6-foot-3 former Nets star guard via buyout",

    "description": "Why Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is proving Ruben Amorim was wrong to keep ignoring him.",
    "fullText": "It was after Manchester United's first game against West Ham this season that Ruben Amorim let his guard down on Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nUnited drew 1-1 with the relegation-threatened Hammers at Old Trafford in December, with Mainoo left on the bench throughout - and Amorim deciding Lisandro Martinez for Luke Shaw was a better final substitution as he looked for a winner.\n\n\"You always ask me the same thing,\" said United's then manager, when questioned why he had left the 20-year-old on the bench.\n\n\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England, but that doesn't mean I need to put Kobbie on when I feel I shouldn't.\"\n\nThe \"you love Kobbie\" comment felt personal. The rationale, in Amorim's mind, for why he was repeatedly being asked by the media why he hardly used Mainoo.\n\nThat assessment missed the point.\n\nIt was not that the media loved Mainoo. It was that they had previously seen the positive benefits he can bring to a team.\n\nJudging by the 25,000 likes on a social media post on X during the 2-0 win over Tottenham on Saturday, observing that with each passing game Amorim's stance on Mainoo looks ridiculous, huge numbers of fans had seen it too.\n\nFans also failed to understand why the academy-raised midfielder did not start a single Premier League match this season prior to Amorim's departure.\n\nAmorim's initial replacement, Darren Fletcher, brought Mainoo on for the final 16 minutes of last month's draw at Burnley, having ditched the three-man central defence to allow for an extra player in the middle of the pitch.\n\nThe midfielder started the following game against Brighton in the FA Cup and has kept his place for all four matches of Michael Carrick's short reign.\n\nAgainst Tottenham, Mainoo created Bryan Mbeumo's opener with a deft pass to the edge of the penalty area with the inside of his right foot after dashing across the goal to meet Bruno Fernandes' short corner.\n\n\"Yes, there's no doubt,\" said Carrick afterwards, upon being asked whether Mainoo was back to the level of his breakthrough season in 2023-24, when he scored in the FA Cup final and started for England in the Euros final defeat by Spain.\n\nOn the face of it, seven goals and five assists in 90 first-team appearances does not look much.\n\nBut that is not the point. Mainoo has an excellent feel for the flow of games and is an all-round midfielder.\n\nThat applied to Carrick himself two decades ago. It was the reason Sir Alex Ferguson brought him north from Tottenham.\n\nIn a chat with his brother Graeme for the Football Association before he left United in 2018, Carrick himself explained the subtleties of a \"great pass\".\n\n\"The execution is probably the easiest bit a lot of the time,\" he said.\n\n\"It is about preparing for it, getting your body position right, understanding the context of the game, knowing the risk and reward.\n\n\"Even if it is a three-yard pass, you are giving the ball to someone for them to do something instantly. If they have to take a touch and another touch to get hold of the ball, it is not a great pass.\n\n\"You should be dictating what the next pass should be, and your own passing angle should be right.\n\n\"It is a great pass if the next part is how you see it in your head.\"\n\n'I feel at home here' - Carrick hints he wants Man Utd stay\n\nWhy Man Utd are taking their time over manager decision\n\nMainoo's resurgence has created separate debates.\n\nThe first, clearly, relates to Amorim, not just on one individual player but an apparent lack of trust in United's academy, which staff members picked up on and were furious about.\n\nIt is amazing to think six of Mainoo's 10 senior caps came during Euro 2024. He played the first Nations League game immediately afterwards, but - after pulling out of the October squad that followed - has not featured since.\n\nGiving himself a chance to break into Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad was the reason why he was so keen to join Napoli on loan before the summer transfer window closed.\n\nNow he has five games at the most - starting with Tuesday's return meeting at West Ham - to force his way into Tuchel's plans for the March friendlies with Uruguay and Japan, two years after gatecrashing Gareth Southgate's squad at just the right time.\n\nWith Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Alex Scott, who are all on United's radar as they look to reinforce their midfield in the summer, named in November's squad, Mainoo has his work cut out.\n\nCarrick knows the youngster has time on his side.\n\n\"We have to be careful about putting so much on his shoulders and expecting so much of him,\" he said.\n\n\"He's still learning the game. He's had a big high, and then, obviously, didn't play for a little bit.\n\n\"It's easy to think he's a lot older and more experienced than he is. He's just got to be patient.\"\n\nMan Utd keen to resume Mainoo contract talks\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons put on a show Monday night, and it had little to do with basketball. In the third quarter, players from both sides got into an all-out brawl that baffled spectators, and other NBA players who later saw the footage had strong reactions as well.\n\nThe altercation began when Moussa Diabate fouled Jalen Duren. Duren responded by pushing Diabaté in the face, which quickly escalated the situation. Moments later, Isaiah Stewart came running from the Pistons bench and got into it with Miles Bridges, who had also stepped into the fray. The chaos ultimately led to all four players being ejected.\n\nJaylen Brown was at home, streaming. And with the Hornets vs. Pistons brawl being the talk of the town, he decided to react to it.\n\nThe Celtics star understood why Diabate lost his cool. In the heat of the moment, he said that when someone “mushes” or shoves another player’s face, it can make your blood boil. Brown even hinted that he might have reacted the same way if he were in Diabate’s position.\n\n“If a dude takes his hand and mush your face like that… I ain’t gon lie, somebody gotta die,” Brown declared, treating the mushing of one’s face as the ultimate disrespect.\n\nThe NBA, however, will not agree with Diabate or any of the other three involved. The players will likely be suspended, with Stewart, who ran the length of the court to join a fight he was not initially involved in, expected to face the harshest penalty.\n\nStewart, meanwhile, was unapologetic. “You don’t expect me to sit on the bench. The f *k I got drafted to Detroit for,”* he was heard saying in the tunnel after getting ejected. Duren, on the other hand, seemed to realize that the situation got out of hand.\n\n“At the end of the day, we would love to keep it basketball, but things happen. Everybody was just playing hard,” he said, but admittedthat the Pistons have been targeted by rivals throughout the entire season. “This isn’t the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be.”\n\nThe post “Somebody Gotta Die”: Jaylen Brown Assesses Jalen Duren ‘Mushing’ Moussa Diabate’s Face During Hornets-Pistons Brawl appeared first on The SportsRush.",

    "fullText": "San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Keion White underwent surgery after being shot in the ankle at a post-Super Bowl event early Monday morning.\n\n\"The location is 290 14th Street crossing Minna and Mission for the shooting.\"\n\nDispatch audio obtained by ABC7 Eyewitness News laying out the moments White was shot.\n\nSan Francisco police say they responded to calls for the shooting on the 1700 block of Mission Street around 4 a.m. Monday.\n\nOur partners at the San Francisco Standard report the defensive end was hosting a party at Dahlia's - a bar and nightclub.\n\nPolice say there was a verbal altercation between two groups and then White was shot.\n\nNews of the shooting has sent shockwaves through the Bay Area which had just finished hosting a successful Super Bowl hours before.\n\nThe 49ers released the following statement:\n\n\"Keion White was a victim of a shooting and sustained a bullet wound to his ankle this morning in San Francisco. He is currently undergoing surgery at a local hospital. We will provide further updates when appropriate.\"\n\nIn a post on X, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie wrote:\n\n\"Any violent incident in our city is unacceptable, and I'm hoping Keion recovers quickly. I've spoken with SFPD and 49ers leadership- we are all grateful to our SFPD officers for their quick response. As always, I will continue working with San Francisco law enforcement to ensure our neighborhoods and our residents are safe.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, White took to his own social media to post a photo from the stands at the Super Bowl.\n\nComments on that post show an outpouring of support from fans after word had gotten out.\n\nOn the streets of the city near where the shooting happened, people who live there are also processing the news.\n\nElina Kang says she was woken up by the police activity outside her apartment.\n\n\"My window is right by my bed so I saw lights. I think that's why I woke up at first,\" said Kang.\n\nKang tells us she only moved to the area last week but knows it's had its problems with safety in the past.\n\n\"It kind of seems par for the course. I'm not entirely like how could this happen here,\" said Kang.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department says the case remains open and no arrests have been made.\n\nWhite is the second 49ers player to be shot in the past 18 months, after wide receiver Ricky Pearsall who was shot in the chest during an armed robbery in Union Square.\n\nIf you're on the ABC7 News app, click here to watch live",

    "fullText": "Chelsea head coach Liam Rosenior and star player Cole Palmer were spotted watching the Blues U18s side play last night.\n\nUnfortunately, the youngsters lost 4-1 against Manchester City in the FA Youth Cup, but it was great to see some faces from the first team there supporting and watching the academy lads.\n\nBoth Palmer and Rosenior have their own game to concentrate on tonight of course, and former Blues striker Chris Sutton believes that they should beat Leeds United comfortably later on and they will be out looking for revenge.\n\nChelsea face their second serious relegation battling club in a row, after beating Wolves 3-1 at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon to continue Rosenior’s fabulous start as Blues boss.\n\nAs you can see in the images above, Rosenior and Palmer were spotted at Kingsmeadow last night supporting the U18s side.\n\nI’m sure Rosenior needed that coffee that he is clutching on to, and Palmer needed that hood and warm jacket. It was not great conditions last night, as it consistently always seems to be raining in the UK in 2026 so far!\n\nAttentions will switch back to the senior team now as the lads wake up this morning hoping to continue some very good form across the last games.\n\nLeeds are fighting to stay in the Premier League so they could present a tough opposition. But the reality is that Chelsea must win this game because they have a very tough run coming up after this one. It will tell us a lot about the manager and the players and where we are now at.",

    "fullText": "Give he joined Bayern Munich in the summer of 2025, the 2025/26 season is the first season Jonathan Tah has worked with Bayern head coach Vincent Kompany. Even so, the Germany international has come away impressed by the Belgian.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Germany, as captured by @iMiaSanMia, Tah talked about his head coach and what he does so well.\n\n“There are drills where he joins in or briefly demonstrates something. Not for very long, though. He makes a lot of corrections, and that makes you realize the details he pays attention to. These details can be tiny, but if you change them, the risk of conceding a goal is much lower. Just because you’ve adjusted a position. That’s really impressive,” said Tah.\n\nSo what has he learned from this detailed coaching? “Many details, but also how important it is to communicate on the pitch. That’s what he expects from me, but he emphasizes again and again how much you can compensate for with that. When the team is compact, when we have to defend deep, when the right time is to press high. The kind of communication he teaches us makes a huge difference on the pitch.”\n\nIt certainly helps to have a legendary center back as your coach to help improve as a center back, is it not?",

    "title": "North Dakota State, winner of 10 FCS titles, jumps to FBS to join Mountain West in football",
    "description": "North Dakota State, which won 10 of the last 15 championships in the FCS, will give the revamped Mountain West an even 10 members for football starting in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Perennial FCS power North Dakota State will move up to the FBS this season and join the Mountain West for football, confident that sustained success at the previous two levels can continue behind a hefty new investment in the program.\n\nNorth Dakota State, which won 10 of the last 15 championships in the FCS, will give the revamped Mountain West an even 10 members for football starting in 2026. The Bison went 12-1 in 2025, losing 29-28 at home in the second round of the playoffs to eventual runner-up Illinois State. They’re 9-5 all-time against FBS opponents.\n\n“One of the concerns was, ‘Will NDSU be competitive?’” interim university president Rick Berg said. “I think we will. Unlike others, we’ve been preparing for this moment for years and years, and I think they’re going to be surprised when NDSU hits the Mountain West.”\n\nNDSU must pay a $5 million reclassification fee to the NCAA for the move and a $12.5 million entry fee to the Mountain West, athletic director Matt Larsen confirmed at a news conference on Monday. Those costs will be privately funded by boosters and donors, Larsen said.\n\nIn addition, the program will need more scholarships and staff support and a bigger travel and recruiting budget. NDSU also won’t be able to fully access conference or College Football Playoff revenue until 2032 after the current media rights contracts expire. But in a state with no major professional sports franchises, the Bison enjoy robust fan support in the growing Fargo area along the state’s eastern border with Minnesota and from a proud network of alumni in the region. The university has about 9,700 undergraduate students this school year.\n\n“There’s going to be an increase, and it’s going to be a significant increase, but we’ll get it to a level where we can compete based on dollars in Fargo, North Dakota,” Larsen said.\n\nThe Bison moved all of their athletic teams to Division I in 2004, after winning eight NCAA Division II football titles.\n\n“The Bison bring a championship mindset and a bold vision for growth that aligns with the unwavering commitment to the excellence of the Mountain West. Their dedication to elevating the student-athlete experience — on the field, in the classroom, and throughout the community — will energize the Mountain West and help propel our football profile to new heights nationwide,” Mountain West Commissioner Gloria Nevarez said in a statement distributed by the conference.\n\nNorth Dakota State’s move will take effect on July 1, mirroring the departure Northern Illinois is making for football only from the Mid-American Conference. Texas-El Paso will become a full member for all sports starting with the 2026-27 school year, along with Hawaii, which was already playing football in the Mountain West. UC Davis, which will remain in the FCS, and Grand Canyon, which does not play football, will join the Mountain West for all sports except football.\n\nThe holdovers are Air Force, Nevada, New Mexico, San Jose State, UNLV and Wyoming. Departing the Mountain West for the rebuilt Pac-12 starting in 2026-27 are Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Utah State, a move that has pitted the two conferences against each other in court over exit fees.\n\nNDSU will immediately play a full eight-game conference schedule but won’t be eligible for the Mountain West title game or the College Football Playoff until the 2028 season. For the next two years, they can only play in a bowl game if there aren’t enough eligible teams to fill all the spots, as Delaware and Missouri State were able to do in 2025.\n\nNorth Dakota State will remain in the Summit League in other sports for now. The Bison spent 18 seasons in the Missouri Valley Football Conference, winning 12 titles in the most consistently competitive FCS league. The MVFC sent six of its 10 teams to the FCS playoffs in 2025, including Illinois State, North Dakota, South Dakota, South Dakota State and Youngstown State.\n\nSouth Dakota State, which won FCS national titles in the 2022 and 2023 seasons, has played North Dakota State for the Dakota Marker Trophy since both programs moved to Division I in 2004. NDSU leads 12-10 in yet another college football trophy series that now has an unclear future. The Bison will play four non-conference games, but even some of the sport’s most hallowed rivalries have vanished when schools wind up in different leagues.\n\nNDSU will aim to play one team from a Power Four conference, two from the Group of Six conferences, and one from the FCS each season, Larsen said, leaving open the possibility to play at least one team from the current MVFC as the scheduling matrix allows moving forward.\n\n“That’s not something we would close the door on. I think we’d be open to playing just about anybody from an FCS perspective,” he said.",

    "fullText": "The only time Liverpool have control in midfield is when the opposition plays a low block.\n\nAnd even then it's pointless, as our play is slow and without ideas - so we keep the ball for possession's sake.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister is starting ahead of Curtis Jones but he shouldn't be. The Argentine has had a very poor season and he went completely missing in the first half against Manchester City.\n\nRyan Gravenberch can dribble but is a horrible passer, while our best midfielder, Dom Szoboszlai, is being wasted at right-back.\n\nA few years ago when Liverpool were having a poor season because of a defensive injury crisis, Jurgen Klopp decided to field Fabinho and Gini Wijnaldum at centre-back to get as many of his best players in the team as possible.\n\nIt didn't work and eventually he picked real centre-backs Rhys Williams and Nat Philipps and Liverpool went on to secure a top-four finish.\n\nSlot needs to do this now. Use Calvin Ramsay or Wataru Endo at right-back and let Szoboszlai play in midfield. Playing Mac Allister and Gravenberch, neither of whom provide stability, as a double pivot, is too dangerous - as proven by how City strolled through our centre in the first half.\n\nWe also have nothing off the bench. Hugo Ekitike is brilliant but after 70 minutes his legs run out every week.\n\nWhy Slot doesn't use his subs earlier I'll never know. He needs to put trust in his non-starters. He makes it so obvious he doesn't rate them.\n\nFind more from Jordan Chamberlain at Empire of the Kop",

    "fullText": "With FPL GW-26 fast approaching, choosing the right captain could be the difference between a green arrow and a frustrating red one.\n\nThis double game week presents some standout opportunities, especially with Arsenal assets firmly in the spotlight.\n\nBelow, I break down the best captain pick options for game week 26, highlighting form, fixtures, and multiple routes to points to help you make the smartest decision.\n\nIf you’re going into FPL game week 26 captain picks without an Arsenal player, Bruno Fernandes is a very strong alternative.\n\nHe’s currently in great form and remains Manchester United’s main creative and penalty threat.\n\nAn away fixture against West Ham offers plenty of upside, especially given Bruno’s consistency for minutes, chances created, and goal involvement.\n\nHe’s a safe yet explosive option for managers looking to captain outside of Arsenal.\n\nDeclan Rice stands out as one of the most well-rounded FPL GW-26 captain picks.\n\nHis appeal comes from multiple avenues to points: goals, assists, defensive contributions, and near-guaranteed minutes.\n\nUnlike some attacking assets, Rice offers reliability alongside upside, making him my top Arsenal choice.\n\nFor managers seeking balance and consistency, he is arguably the best captain pick option for game week 26 of the 2025/26 EPL season.\n\nOn paper, Gabriel may be the strongest of all FPL game week 26 captain picks. Arsenal face Brentford and Wolves, two fixtures that heavily favor defensive returns.\n\nGabriel offers a high likelihood of clean sheets, defensive contributions, and strong goal threat from set pieces.\n\nAgainst Brentford, he boasts 6 wins, 1 draw, and 5 clean sheets in 7 matches, while against Wolves he has recorded 6 clean sheets and scored 2 EPL goals.\n\nFor managers chasing maximum upside, Gabriel is an elite captaincy option this week.\n\nGW-26 is an excellent opportunity to activate your Triple Captain chip, especially on an Arsenal player. With strong fixtures and high expected returns, this could be the perfect moment to go all-in.",

    "description": "Pitt and its women's basketball coach Tory Verdi are being sued by six former players who allege he created a \"hostile, discriminatory,\" environment.",
    "fullText": "Six former women’s basketball players from the University of Pittsburgh are suing the school and its coach, Tory Verdi.\n\nThe six individual civil suits were filed in the U.S. District Court for Western Pennsylvania on Friday, Feb. 6. Each player is represented by the same attorney, Keenan Holmes. Each suit alleges Title IX violations and that Verdi inflicted \"emotional, psychological, and physical abuse\" against the players and that he created a “hostile, discriminatory, and retaliatory environment.\"\n\nMuch of the allegations in the six lawsuits — which USA TODAY Sports obtained copies of — read similarly and cite the same instances to back up their allegations that Verdi “weaponized his authority to manipulate, demean, and emotionally destabilize players through targeted mistreatment, verbal abuse, gaslighting, and retaliatory conduct.”\n\n“Verdi used his position of authority to engage in emotionally abusive conduct, retaliation, and psychological manipulation that transcended poor coaching and entered into constitutional violations,” one lawsuits reads. “The program was defined by fear and emotional volatility as players were routinely demeaned, psychologically isolated, and pressured to perform under abusive conditions.”\n\nSpokespersons for Pitt’s athletic department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\nThe lawsuits were filed by Favor Ayodele, Raeven Boswell, Makayla Elmore, Brooklynn Miles, Isabella Perkins and Jasmine Timmerson. Their suits also claim that Pitt knew about the players’ complaints about Verdi, but took no action.\n\nConcerns, according to the lawsuits, were raised with Senior Woman Administrator Jennifer Tuscano, former athletic director Heather Lyke, and Laurel Gift — Pitt’s Assistant Vice Chancellor for Compliance, Investigations, and Ethics. Lyke is now the Special Advisor to the Chancellor and Athletic Director at Syracuse.\n\nOften the first specific incident cited in the lawsuits is one that allegedly occurred after a practice during the 2023-24 season when Verdi told the team, “Every night I lay in bed I want to kill myself because of you.” The former players say this “caused fear, emotional distress, and confusion among players.”\n\nThe lawsuits cite another incident where, before playing a game against Clemson, Verdi allegedly “directed xenophobic and culturally insensitive remarks” toward a foreign-born player, telling her to “go back home because ICE is coming.” One lawsuit claims that Verdi told foreign-born players, “We speak English here,” when they would use their native languages or accents.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Perkins alleges that Verdi once told her during the summer of 2024 in a private meeting, “I don’t like you as a player, but I’d let my son date you.”\n\nPerkins also says that she was “routinely denied adequate medical care” and forced to play while injured. Perkins said she confided in the team doctor about the “hostile and abusive environment perpetuated by Coach Verdi.” That disclosure was reported to Verdi, Perkins alleges, and it was met with retaliation. Perkins adds that her request for a medical redshirt was denied because Pitt mishandled her submission to the ACC.\n\nOther allegations made in the lawsuits include Verdi berating the team after the death of one player’s father, allegedly telling them, “I knew you guys were bad basketball players, but I didn’t know you were bad people too.”\n\nThe players also claim that Verdi mocked one player’s appearance and weight, telling her “you look pregnant,” while she was recovering from injury. The six players also claim that Verdi “intentionally created and exploited racial division” and that “players of color were subjected to harsher discipline, less patience, and fewer opportunities than similarly situated white teammates.”\n\nOne former player, Elmore, says she “made a good-faith report” to Pitt's compliance office regarding repeated NCAA practice-hour violations by Verdi. Elmore claims that the compliance office disclosed her identity to Verdi and nothing was done.\n\nAnother former player, Ayodele, says that when she was injured, Verdi didn’t speak to her for nearly six months and ignored “her medical and emotional needs and isolating her from team support.”\n\nSome of the former players say they have had to seek mental health treatment and therapy after playing for Verdi. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a declaration that Pitt violated Title IX.\n\nVerdi is in his third season coaching the Panthers, who currently have an overall record of 8-17, a mark that includes a loss to Division III Scranton. He has a record of 29-60 while leading Pitt. The Panthers have not posted a winning record in ACC play since the 2014-15 season, which is also the last time they made the NCAA tournament.\n\nPreviously, Verdi was the head coach at UMass and Eastern Michigan, where he won a combined 200 games. Verdi signed a six-year contract with Pitt when he was hired in 2023.\n\nRiding an eight-game losing streak, Pitt is scheduled to play again on Thursday night at home against Syracuse.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Pitt women's basketball coach accused of abuse in lawsuits by players",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford has been impressing in Spain for FC Barcelona.\n\nThe 28-year-old has taken to life in La Liga like a duck to water, contributing to 23 goals in all competitions.\n\nRashford is currently on loan at the Catalan club, but it seems likely he will stay permanently after the summer.\n\nThere were rumours that the departure of Ruben Amorim as manager at Old Trafford might see him make a return.\n\nNonetheless, recent reports have refuted this and only confirmed his desire to stay and Barcelona’s ambition to make the deal permanent this summer for £30.3 million.\n\nIt seems that Rashford is not only impressing Barcelona fans, but his form is also attracting the attention of some of his former teammates at United.\n\nMundo Deportivo reports that, “the England international winger’s performance for the Blaugrana has generated both surprise and delight in British football circles.”\n\nThe Spanish media outlet was also incredibly complimentary of Rashford’s performance versus RCD Mallorca at the weekend, where “he shouldered much of the attacking responsibility for the league leaders during the most crucial moments of the game.”\n\nThe paper points out that after winning the Super Cup in January, some of Rashford’s former teammates took to social media to congratulate him on the victory.\n\nFormer captain Harry Maguire posted, “I love it, mate,” accompanying his comment with a clapping emoji.\n\nThe current club captain, Bruno Fernandes, penned “Congratulations, brother” and added a red heart emoji.\n\nDutch striker Joshua Zirkzee also got in on the act, posting, “Congratulations, brother.”\n\nFC Barcelona and Rashford will next be in action when they travel to Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final on Thursday evening.\n\nFeature image Clive Mason via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Liverpool spent £450m last summer on new players as Arne Slot and Richard Hughes set about retaining the Premier League title.\n\nAmong the new arrivals were Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak - coming in on British-record deals. Also added was Hugo Ekitike up front - as the head coach and sporting director overhauled the frontline.\n\nSeveral players in attack had to make way to accommodate the new faces - including Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Ben Gannon-Doak.\n\nThat helped the club towards a figure approaching £200m in sales - but there are signs that another clearout may be on the horizon.\n\nNew faces are coming next summer - with Jeremy Jacquet already secured and a winger set to be announced too. And in order to make space for those arrivals more current Liverpool stars are going to be leaving.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nWe could see the likes of Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah among the departures as Hughes and Slot plot improvements across the squad.\n\nThe Italian, 28, arrived on an initial £10m deal from Juventus back in September 2024. Despite winning the Premier League title the winger has endured a difficult spell on Merseyside - never looking like he was going to decisively win over Slot.\n\nJuventus were heavily linked with a move for their former player in January but that deal ran aground as the Reds were seeking a permanent move rather than a loan.\n\nNow the club’s demands have been set out in a new report from Caught Offside - which claims that Juventus, Napoli and Roma are set to contest the signature of the Italy international.\n\nLiverpool’s price range for a summer deal for Chiesa has now reached between £21 and £26m according to the report.\n\n“The Liverpool board is “open to letting him go”, with doubts about his ability to adapt to the Premier League pace, while Serie A sides are already moving in for Chiesa,” the report reads.\n\nThat is a mammoth sum for a fringe player - and it could represent a clear £16m profit on Chiesa. The Premier League champions are relatively well protected from a transfer fee perspective with the versatile forward contracted until 2028.\n\nBut Hughes needs to be careful that he doesn’t price the £150k per week forward out of a move completely. Chiesa has made just THREE Premier League starts under Slot since arriving at the club at the start of last season.\n\nIt is unlikely that his track record at Anfield is going to attract bids quite that high and so the LFC executive might need to come to a compromise.",

    "fullText": "Leeds United will look to continue their exciting run of form when they travel to face resurgent Chelsea on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Whites arrive in a confident mood following an impressive victory at Elland Road over the weekend.\n\nHowever, Leeds face a significant test against a Chelsea side enjoying a perfect Premier League record under new boss Liam Rosenior.\n\nWhile the hosts are pushing for Champions League qualification, Leeds are focused on pulling further clear of the relegation battle, setting up a clash with plenty at stake.\n\nLeeds have shown clear signs of progress in recent weeks, winning three of their last five league matches.\n\nTheir latest outing saw them claim a commanding 3-1 triumph over Nottingham Forest in West Yorkshire.\n\nDaniel Farke’s side raced into a three-goal lead through Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, with the latter continuing his productive campaign.\n\nLeeds currently sit 16th in the table and hold a six-point cushion above the relegation zone.\n\nAnother positive result against Chelsea would significantly strengthen their survival hopes as the season moves towards its final stretch.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelsea have rediscovered momentum under Rosenior. The Blues have won each of their four Premier League fixtures since his arrival.\n\nOver the weekend, they claimed an eye-catching 3-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers, powered by Cole Palmer’s historic first-half hat-trick.\n\nThe West London side sits fifth in the standings and remains firmly in the race for a top-four finish.\n\nHowever, Chelsea have struggled in midweek fixtures this season and will be wary of Leeds, who already beat them 3-1 earlier in the campaign.\n\nChelsea are unbeaten in their last seven home league games against Leeds, winning the previous six meetings at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe Whites last recorded a victory at the ground in 1999.\n\nLeeds are chasing a league double over Chelsea for the first time since their title-winning 1991/92 campaign.\n\nChelsea are winless in their three midweek Premier League fixtures this season.\n\nLeeds have lost seven of their 12 league matches away from home this term, collecting just seven points on their travels.\n\nFarke is expected to keep faith with the side that impressed over the weekend. The German tactician has largely benefited from a near fully-fit squad heading into the clash.\n\nAnton Stach, 27, remains Leeds’ main injury concern as he continues to struggle with a hip problem.\n\nDan James has returned to the matchday squad and is pushing for his first start since November after recovering from a hamstring injury.\n\nCalvert-Lewin is set to spearhead the attack once again, supported by Okafor, who should retain his place in the XI.\n\nLauded by Farke as a player with ‘special ability’, Okaford could prove decisive in West London.\n\nKarl Darlow; Joe Rodon, Pascal Struijk, James Justin; Jayden Bogle, Brenden Aaronson, Ethan Ampadu, Ilia Gruev, Gudmundsson; Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Noah Okafor.",

    "fullText": "West Ham United will aim to continue their survival push when they host in-form Manchester United at the London Stadium on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Hammers head into the contest buoyed by a weekend victory, but they face a daunting challenge against a rejuvenated side on a remarkable run under Michael Carrick.\n\nWith West Ham and Man Utd chasing vastly different objectives, the clash promises to carry major significance at both ends of the Premier League table.\n\nWest Ham have shown encouraging signs of life in recent weeks, winning three of their last four league matches.\n\nThe Hammers sealed a vital 2-0 victory away at relegation rivals Burnley, boosting their hopes of climbing out of the bottom three.\n\nFirst-half strikes from Crysencio Summerville and new signing Valentin Castellanos proved decisive.\n\nThe result leaves Nuno Espirito Santo’s side just three points from safety as the campaign enters a crucial phase.\n\nDespite their recent resurgence, West Ham’s home record remains a concern.\n\nThe Hammers have won just four of their last 20 Premier League games at the London Stadium.\n\nHowever, they will draw confidence from their recent record against United, having won their last three home league meetings against the Red Devils.\n\nMeanwhile, United arrive in exceptional form under caretaker boss Carrick, who has overseen four consecutive Premier League victories.\n\nUnited strengthened their top-four credentials with a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur last time out, following notable wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham.\n\nUnited currently sit fourth in the standings and remain firmly in the race for Champions League qualification.\n\nCarrick’s side have also impressed away from home, losing just one of their last nine league matches on the road. West Ham have a mountain to climb.\n\nWest Ham have won each of their last three home league matches against Manchester United.\n\nThe Red Devils have lost four of their last six Premier League games against the Irons.\n\nWest Ham completed a league double over United last season and drew 1-1 at Old Trafford earlier this campaign.\n\nThe Hammers have lost only three of their last 15 midweek Premier League home fixtures, while United have won just one of their last nine midweek away league matches.\n\nNuno will again be without Jean-Clair Todibo, who serves the second match of his suspension following his recent red card.\n\nLukasz Fabianski also remains sidelined with a back injury.\n\nAxel Disasi is expected to continue in defence after making his debut against Burnley, likely partnering Dinos Mavropanos at centre-back.\n\nNuno said he did ‘really well’ versus Burnley, and he should get the starting berth.

They have collected just eight points from their last eight league matches at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nHaving secured a 1-0 victory away at Bournemouth earlier in the campaign, David Moyes’ side will be eager to complete a league double over the Cherries for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, Bournemouth continue to impress under Andoni Iraola despite losing key attacker Antoine Semenyo during the winter transfer window.\n\nThe Cherries are unbeaten in their last five league fixtures and earned a credible 1-1 draw against title-chasing Aston Villa last time out.\n\nThe visitors sit 11th in the table and could leapfrog Everton with a convincing victory.\n\nWhile Bournemouth’s attacking output on the road has been impressive, defensive vulnerabilities have limited their progress away from home.\n\nBournemouth have lost six of their eight away league games against Everton, although they staged a 3-2 comeback win in this fixture last season.\n\nEach of the last four Premier League meetings between the sides has been goalless at half-time, with the last 11 goals in this fixture arriving after the interval.\n\nEverton have won both of their Tuesday Premier League fixtures this season, while Bournemouth have won only one of their last eight midweek Premier League matches.\n\nMoyes is dealing with just one confirmed absentee in Jack Grealish.\n\nHe is expected to miss the remainder of the season after sustaining an ankle injury that could require surgery.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite has returned to fitness following a hamstring problem, creating competition in central defence alongside Michael Keane and James Tarkowski.\n\nKeane impressed during Everton’s recent defensive run and may retain his place in the starting line-up.\n\nMeanwhile, 19-year-old Harrison Armstrong should continue in attack.\n\nJordan Pickford; Jake O’Brien, James Tarkowski, Michael Keane, Vitaliy Mykolenko; James Garner, Idrissa Gueye; Harrison Armstrong, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye; Thierno Barry.",

    "description": "After an impressive start to life at Newcastle, what has happened to Nick Woltemade?",
    "fullText": "Nick Woltemade had his cap pulled over his eyes as he left the Stadium of Light.\n\nBut there was no way the towering Newcastle United forward - all 6ft 6in of him - was going to slip out of the stadium unnoticed.\n\nNot after his own goal settled the Wear-Tyne derby a couple of months ago.\n\nWoltemade's team-mates were booed by the Sunderland supporters gathered outside as they climbed on to the team bus - but Woltemade was applauded, cheered and even serenaded with chants of \"Hero! Hero! Hero!\" after inadvertently heading Newcastle's bitter rivals to a 1-0 victory back in December.\n\nSome players might have taken a bit of time to come back from a blow like that.\n\nBut Woltemade responded in immediate and emphatic fashion, scoring a first-half double against Chelsea in his next Newcastle start less than a week later.\n\nIt was a sign of his mental strength, and Woltemade has had to draw on those reserves of resilience lately after failing to find the back of the net for Eddie Howe's side since December.\n\n\"He started so well,\" the Newcastle head coach said. \"Everyone expected him to continue. As much as we wanted that for him, that's very difficult to do.\"\n\nSo why have the goals dried up for the Germany forward?\n\nI'd resign if I wasn't still right for job - Howe\n\n'I'm not doing my job well enough' - but is Howe now under pressure?\n\nIt is a question few could have imagined asking not so long ago.\n\nNot after Woltemade scored six goals from his first six efforts on target for the club, including bullet headers against Arsenal and Wolves, an audacious flick against Union Saint-Gilloise and a stunning backheel at Brighton.\n\nSuch an instant impact even took Woltemade by surprise following his £69m move from Stuttgart in the final days of the summer window.\n\nBut it got to the stage where the German went into every game firmly believing he would find the back of the net.\n\nEven those closest to Woltemade were taken aback by the devastating manner in which he dispatched a penalty against Nottingham Forest in a 2-0 victory back in October.\n\nHowever, it was never going to be sustainable for Woltemade to keep scoring at such a clinical rate, particularly when he was relied upon to do so while fellow forward Yoane Wissa recovered from a knee injury.\n\nWissa has since returned to ease the burden, but the pair are both struggling in front of goal during an intense run of fixtures.\n\nThe schedule for club and country has been unrelenting, which has limited the amount of time Woltemade has had to properly work with the coaching staff on the training pitches.\n\nThat has been huge frustration internally as Newcastle continue to adapt following the departure of a very different type of striker in Alexander Isak, who joined Liverpool last summer.\n\nBut Woltemade is understood to be calm about his goal drought.\n\nSuch is his character, the forward is more concerned about Newcastle getting back to winning ways following a run of one victory in eight matches in all competitions.\n\nIt is also easy to forget that Woltemade is still only 23.\n\nHe only became a regular starter at Stuttgart in December 2024, before joining Newcastle a few months later after the club missed out on, among others, Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and Benjamin Sesko.\n\nHe had not played outside his homeland before, and had to quickly adapt to the speed and physicality of the Premier League, as well as a system previously tailored to a rapid striker who led the defensive press from the front and ran in behind, which is not Woltemade's game.\n\nThe Bundesliga is fierce in its own right, but it is rather telling that Woltemade has only been awarded four fouls in his last 11 top-flight fixtures.\n\nPremier League analysts and defenders now have had a greater body of work to study in order to try to limit his influence in this Newcastle side compared to earlier in the campaign.\n\nThere have been times where Woltemade has not been in the box - lacking those instincts a traditional poacher has - and other occasions where he has looked isolated up front and not had enough runners near him, which is down to the way Newcastle have been set up.\n\nNo wonder, then, Woltemade is only averaging 1.9 shots per game in the league this season.\n\nWoltemade failed to even hit the target with a couple of headers from his most recent chances in front of goal, against Wolves last month, but service has also clearly been an issue for a player who thrives off balls to feet.\n\nAlthough Newcastle lead the way for crosses in the Premier League (637), only eight top-flight sides have a worse crossing accuracy (21.5%).\n\nAlso, rather than being a traditional target man who plays with his back to goal, the technical Woltemade looks most comfortable operating in the spaces between the midfield and the box.\n\nIt was from these areas that at Stuttgart he often showcased a unique ability - for someone so tall to dribble past defenders and link up with those around him.\n\nHowe fielded Woltemade in such a role behind Wissa in a 4-2-3-1 against Bournemouth last month and revisited the experiment as Newcastle attempted to get back into the game in the second half versus Brentford at the weekend.\n\nBut the head coach readily admitted his attack has \"not quite functioned fully yet\" as he attempts to bed his summer signings \"into the team format\".\n\n\"Nick has done everything with such a great attitude,\" he said. \"That's the biggest thing, for me, that means he will continue to be successful.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Can you rewire your brain?",
    "description": "The metaphor of rewiring offers an ideal of engineered precision. But the brain is more like a forest than a circuit board",
    "fullText": "Structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) of a human brain. The data was processed to show the affinity between the ‘flesh’ of the brain and the ‘flesh’ of the head. Image by Parashkev Nachev/Wellcome Collection\n\nPopular wisdom holds we can ‘rewire’ our brains: after a stroke, after trauma, after learning a new skill, even with 10 minutes a day on the right app. The phrase is everywhere, offering something most of us want to believe: that when the brain suffers an assault, it can be restored with mechanical precision. But ‘rewiring’ is a risky metaphor. It borrows its confidence from engineering, where a faulty system can be repaired by swapping out the right component; it also smuggles that confidence into biology, where change is slower, messier and often incomplete. The phrase has become a cultural mantra that is easier to comprehend than the scientific term, neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to change and form new neural connections throughout life.\n\nBut what does it really mean to ‘rewire’ the brain? Is it a helpful shorthand for describing the remarkable plasticity of our nervous system or has it become a misleading oversimplification that distorts our grasp of science?\n\nAfter all, ‘rewiring your brain’ sounds like more than metaphor. It implies an engineering project: a system whose parts can be removed, replaced and optimised. The promise is both alluring and oddly mechanical. The metaphor actually did come from engineering. To an engineer, rewiring means replacing old and faulty circuits with new ones. As the vocabulary of technology crept into everyday life, it brought with it a new way of thinking about the human mind.\n\nMedical roots of the phrase trace back to 1912, when the British surgeon W Deane Butcher compared the body’s neural system to a house’s electrical wiring, describing how nerves connect to muscles much like wires connect appliances to a power source. By the 1920s, the Harvard psychologist Leonard Troland was referring to the visual system as ‘an extremely intricate telegraphic system’, reinforcing the comparison between brain function and electrical networks.\n\nThe metaphor of rewiring also draws strength from changing theories in developmental neuroscience. The brain was thought to be largely static after childhood, becoming a fixed network of circuits, much like a hardwired radio. But beginning in the 1960s, researchers showed that the brain was far more adaptable. Stroke patients could regain function by recruiting new areas of the brain.\n\nThese findings revolutionised rehabilitation medicine. They also gave rise to an idea that would quickly leap beyond the clinic: if brains can rewire, then people can change.\n\nMore recently, the metaphor of neural rewiring has gained popularity alongside new imaging techniques like fMRI and PET scans, which allow researchers to see brain activity in ways never before possible. In studies of stroke recovery, clinicians often observe increased activation in brain regions adjacent to or distant from the area of damage. This is interpreted as the brain ‘rewiring’ itself to restore lost function. Popular science writers have embraced the metaphor as well, using it to explain everything from trauma healing to learning a second language.\n\nBut unlike electrical wiring, which follows rigid, fixed paths, the brain’s connectivity is dynamic and constantly changing. Neurons form and prune synapses – the connections between them – in response to activity and environment, a process governed by complex biochemical signalling rather than simple rerouting. Even when we can map the parts, the picture doesn’t explain the self. As late as 2013, Francis Collins, the then-director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), complained about studies on mapping the brain, in an interview with NPR (US National Public Radio): ‘It’d be like, you know, taking your laptop and prying the top off and staring at the parts inside, you’d be able to say, yeah, this is connected to that, but you wouldn’t know how it worked.’\n\nTo evaluate the metaphor, it’s important to grasp how brain plasticity actually works. We already know a lot about the brain’s remarkable ability to reorganise itself throughout life by forming new neural connections, strengthening existing ones or rerouting functions to undamaged areas. But the logic of neuroplasticity isn’t the same as swapping one wire with another. It’s more like a living forest where paths are gradually worn or abandoned based on use. It involves changes at the cellular level and can occur in response to learning, memory, sensory input and trauma. Importantly, while neuroplasticity is a lifelong feature of the brain, it is more robust during youth and becomes more effort-dependent with age.\n\nThis capacity allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, recover from injuries, learn new information and compensate for lost functions. Neuroplasticity is real, but it’s not magic. It has limits. It requires effort. And it doesn’t always result in perfect recovery or transformation.\n\nUnlike rewiring a machine, plasticity is not as simple as replacing parts. It’s a gradual process and is often inefficient. Synapses, which pass signals between neurons, strengthen or weaken. New dendritic branches – neurons’ treelike extensions – grow while others retract. Entire networks shift their activity over time, but only under the right conditions, and these changes accumulate to support new patterns of function while overall mechanisms become less efficient across the lifespan.\n\nPlasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking\n\nPlasticity happens throughout life, but it’s shaped by many factors: age, environment, repetition, rest, nutrition and emotional state. For example: with months of targeted physical therapy, a stroke survivor can regain movement in a limb by recruiting healthier networks; with intensive, structured practice, a child with dyslexia can gradually develop new reading pathways; and reading braille requires extensive practice and is instrumental in changing relevant brain regions.\n\nIn cases of childhood trauma, certain survival pathways, such as hypervigilance or emotional detachment, may become dominant and reinforced over time. Later in life, therapy may promote the strengthening of alternative circuits related to trust, emotional regulation or self-awareness. But the old pathways aren’t necessarily erased. They remain in the background, potentially reactivated under stress. The idea that the brain is ‘rewired’ to function in a healthier way may offer hope, but it oversimplifies the reality. We build new trails, but the old ones don’t necessarily disappear.\n\nExperience is a major force in shaping the nervous system. But, as the neuroscientists Bryan Kolb and Ian Whishaw argue in their widely cited review of brain plasticity, it always works in context. Over a lifetime, experience ‘alters the synaptic organisation of the brain’, but the brain’s response is also shaped by age, hormones, trophic factors (support proteins), stress, and illness or injury. And because the neocortex can ‘modify its function throughout one’s lifetime’, the same experience can leave different traces in different bodies, at different ages. Kolb and Whishaw capture the broader principle in a line worth keeping: ‘experience can modify brain structure long after brain development is complete’, and those physical changes are widely thought to be part of how memories are stored. In other words, plasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking.\n\nThe same review paper makes a critical observation based on careful studies of rats recovering from injury: the evidence suggests that what looks like recovery at first glance is often the brain finding a workaround. In their words, ‘much of what appears … to be recovery is actually a compensatory substitution of new movements for lost movements.’ In plain terms, the brain is often building a detour, not restoring the same old route.\n\nThe fact that neurons can expand their reach means that, if some of them die, others may broaden their territory to make up for lost processing. In general, the more connections a neuron has, the more it can shape behaviour.\n\nBeyond this, a feedback loop seems to be at work. There is evidence that the environment can change which genes are switched on in the adult brain. One likely route runs through neural activity shaped by experience. Novel experience causes neurons to fire in new patterns; and those neurons in turn can trigger gene programmes that support dendritic and synaptic growth – structural changes that can, over time, shift behaviour. Some of these genes are known to be associated with learning and memory; others are linked to age-related memory deficits. So enrichment can certainly support the brain.\n\nExamples of neuroplasticity abound. During my neurology residency, one of my teachers, a highly specialised neuro-ophthalmologist, demonstrated the adaptability of the brain in a dramatic way. He recreated an informal experiment on himself by wearing glasses that flipped his visual field upside down. At first, he was disoriented. But within weeks, his brain recalibrated, and he was able to function normally in his environment. Even more remarkable was the re-adaptation that occurred when he removed the glasses; his world once again appeared inverted, and it took additional time for his perception to return to baseline. He later recreated another experiment by repeating the process with another set of glasses that reversed left and right, and he reported that this lateral inversion was far more difficult for the brain to compensate for than the vertical one. The experiment demonstrates how the brain adapts by recalibration rather than by restoring an original state, treating the altered input as normal over time.\n\nThe ability to alter speech is another testament to the plasticity of the brain. One fascinating distinction in neuroscience is that speech and singing use different neural pathways. For example, some well-known singers stutter when speaking but not when singing. Elvis Presley famously had a stutter that disappeared when he sang. Ed Sheeran also stuttered as a child and tried many techniques to overcome it. Nothing worked, until, at age nine, he began rapping along to an Eminem album. Through repetition, his fluency improved. Similarly, the country singer Mel Tillis spoke with a stutter but sang fluidly. In each case, fluency emerges not through repair but through recruitment of alternative circuits.\n\nThere’s also the curious case of singers who speak with strong accents but who lose them when they sing. Examples include Ozzy Osbourne, Adele, Ed Sheeran, ABBA and Freddie Mercury. Singing slows speech, elongates vowels and reduces accent markers. Many artists adopt American accents in songs due to the US roots of pop and rock music. The shift again reflects a change in network engagement rather than a permanent alteration of underlying language systems.\n\nAcross the lifespan, brains that are challenged tend to retain greater flexibility\n\nThis difference between speech and song forms the basis of a therapeutic approach known as melodic intonation therapy (MIT). It’s often used with patients suffering from non-fluent aphasia after a stroke, that is, those who can’t speak due to damage in the brain’s speech centres. In MIT, patients sing familiar childhood songs deeply encoded in emotional memory. Remarkably, they are often able to sing words and phrases they cannot otherwise speak. With repetition, speech improves. This is because singing activates preserved right-brain circuits, creating alternative pathways that gradually strengthen the brain’s overall language network. The gain comes through detour and reinforcement, not restoration of the damaged pathway.\n\nRecent research suggests that addiction may, in part, be a wiring issue in the brain. One promising treatment is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive therapy that uses powerful magnetic pulses discharged above the skull to activate specific brain regions. Depending on where the stimulation is applied, it can trigger muscle movement or, more significantly, influence behaviour.\n\nTwo leading theories for the potential of TMS have emerged. One proposes that addiction stems from insufficient or underactive brain wiring, like that which occurs in stroke patients, and that stimulation reactivates dormant circuits. The other – more consistent with what we see in rehabilitation – suggests that damaged or dysregulated circuits are bypassed by strengthening alternative pathways, effectively rerouting brain activity. This ‘detour’ mechanism has been observed in stroke rehabilitation and may apply to addiction as well. TMS has been used in patients addicted to cocaine, and early evidence suggests that several weeks of treatment may be effective in reducing cravings and use.\n\nWhile neuroplasticity resists shortcuts, it does respond to sustained engagement. Across the lifespan, brains that are challenged – cognitively, socially, physically – tend to retain greater flexibility than those that are not. This is not because any single activity ‘rewires’ a specific circuit, but because varied, effortful experiences repeatedly recruit overlapping networks: attention, memory, movement, emotion. Learning a new language, for example, activates distributed regions across both hemispheres, linking auditory perception, working memory, and executive control. Playing a musical instrument does something similar, coupling fine motor coordination with timing, prediction, and emotional recall. Over time, these demands encourage structural and functional changes that support what neuroscientists call cognitive reserve: the brain’s ability to compensate when injury or degeneration occurs.\n\nThe same principle applies beyond formal learning. Singing engages breath, rhythm, language and affect in ways that ordinary speech does not, which is why it can support recovery in some stroke and Parkinson’s patients. Physical activity – especially aerobic exercise – improves cerebral blood flow and is associated with changes in the volume of the hippocampus, a region critical for turning short-term memory into long-term memory. It’s also one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated in adulthood. Social interaction recruits emotional and linguistic circuits simultaneously, offering a kind of neural cross-training that solitary exercises cannot. Even seemingly modest skills, such as learning to juggle, have been shown to induce measurable changes in grey matter after weeks of practice. None of these activities function as targeted neural ‘fixes’. Their value lies instead in repetition, novelty and sustained effort – the slow conditions under which plasticity operates. They do not override biology but work with it, nudging the brain toward adaptation rather than transformation.\n\nGiven what we know about brain plasticity, the overarching claims of brain rewiring often misrepresent both the pace and the nature of neural change. In his guide Rewire Your Brain: Think Your Way to a Better Life (2010), the psychologist John B Arden declares that our brains are not ‘hardwired’ but rather ‘soft-wired’ by experience, and promises strategies to help readers ‘rewire’ their brains so that they can ‘feel calm and positive’ and ‘enhance’ their relationships. The neurologist Philippe Douyon’s book Neuroplasticity: Your Brain’s Superpower: Change Your Brain and Change Your Life (2019) explores how ‘we can give our brains exactly what they need to adapt, heal, and thrive’. The language varies, but the promise is consistent: targeted practices can reliably produce targeted psychological outcomes.\n\nThen there are the brain-rewiring apps. An apt example is Quit Addiction – Rewire Brain, which is geared toward breaking addictions like smoking, vaping or alcohol by combining habit-tracking, motivation tools and progress-monitoring in order to ‘rewire your brain for lasting change’. Across platforms, the metaphor suggests speed, precision and personal control – qualities that biology itself rarely affords.\n\nAnd TED Talks can overstate the case. As the neuroscientist Michael Merzenich explained in his presentation in 2004, the brain’s circuitry is not fixed: the adult brain, in fact, retains a ‘lifelong capacity for plasticity’ which ‘is powerfully expressed’. He later described what takes place within the brain:\n\nThe science is sound, but its popular reception often strips away the conditions – time, repetition, constraint – under which such change occurs.\n\nTo be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression\n\nMerzenich traced this discovery from critical periods in early childhood (when language and vision are calibrated) to adult therapies that retrain neural maps for speech and reading disorders. The key message was simple and striking: plasticity never switches off; it can be accomplished well into adulthood.\n\nMore than a decade later, the neuroscientist Don Vaughn took the stage at TEDxUCLA with a more applied vision. In ‘Neurohacking: Rewiring Your Brain’ (2015), he showcased how emerging tools allow people to consciously shape that plasticity. He described patients receiving non-invasive brain stimulation for depression, parents using apps that translate baby cries into visual signals, and volunteers who learned to self-modulate their brain rhythms through neurofeedback. ‘If we can rewire your brain using devices, would it at all be possible to help your brain rewire itself with just your own thoughts?’ The question captures the cultural leap – from biological possibility to personal mastery.\n\nTaken together, Merzenich’s foundational science and Vaughn’s demonstrations underscore why the phrase ‘rewiring the brain’ has become so potent in popular culture: it gestures not only to the metaphorical promise of self-improvement but also to a concrete, testable biology – the brain’s architecture is malleable and, under the right conditions, it can be reshaped. Yet embedded in these slogans are sweeping assumptions about how the brain works, assumptions that are often oversimplified or outright incorrect. One is the idea of rapid transformation: when an app promises that a week of short audio lessons can ‘rewire’ the brain, it compresses the slow, cumulative processes of learning and adaptation into a quick-fix model. Another is that change is total; to be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression, as if old circuitry can be removed and replaced wholesale. A third is precision targeting, where the discourse tacitly promises that specific practices – such as gratitude exercises or productivity hacks – strike exactly the right neural pathways to produce specific psychological outcomes. All three assumptions resonate with our technological imagination; none align with the messy realities of neuroplasticity.\n\nIn short, the metaphor is powerful but problematic. It suggests that, no matter where someone begins their process, whether recovering from a head trauma or battling cognitive decline, the brain can snap back to normal. There’s a certain poetry to that idea. A reassurance that we are not static beings and that transformation is possible at any age.\n\nThere are contexts where this has value. It can help patients understand that their brains are not static or irreparably broken. It frames recovery as active rather than passive, encouraging participation in therapies that promote healing. Educators have also embraced the metaphor when teaching students. The idea that you can rewire your brain reinforces the possibility of learning and change. In clinical settings, it can reduce shame and fatalism.\n\nHowever, for stroke survivors, the promise of rewiring can be both inspiring and unrealistic. Some regain remarkable function; others plateau despite intense therapy. In Alzheimer’s, the degenerative nature of the disease limits the brain’s plasticity. In such contexts, rewiring may imply a level of control or optimism that the brain itself does not always permit. Hope matters. But so does honesty.\n\nMetaphors can motivate, but they can also mislead. The notion that someone can rewire their brain through sheer willpower, self-help books or 10 minutes of daily meditation risks turning serious neurological change into a gimmick. While cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and physical rehabilitation have strong evidence supporting their effects on brain function, these changes occur over time and have biological constraints.\n\nThe brain is not a circuit board. Changing it is not as simple as swapping a wire or updating software. ‘Rewiring’ implies speed and precision, a single tweak that creates a desired result; it implies that changes in the brain are mechanical and always possible, none of which is guaranteed. The reality of neuroplasticity is far messier: it’s a biological process that is incremental and frustratingly slow. And while science does support the idea that the brain can change, it also reminds us that change comes at a cost. It requires time and effort, and sometimes it ends in failure.\n\nThe metaphor turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw\n\nHere’s where the metaphor of rewiring starts to do damage. It suggests that brain changes are mechanical and under direct conscious control. But in practice, brain changes are nonlinear. Most often they are unconscious and deeply tied to emotion and new behaviour.\n\nOne common myth is that a single realisation or decision can ‘rewire’ you. In truth, even profound insights rarely result in lasting neural change unless reinforced by repetition and behaviour. Another is that you can eliminate trauma responses by replacing them. But trauma alters deep, limbic structures that don’t ‘recode’ easily. They adapt, yes, but only slowly and not always completely.\n\nThere’s also the misconception that anyone can change anything if they just try hard enough. But not all brains have the same capacity or conditions for change. There’s a dark side to the optimism around brain change. When the metaphor of rewiring is oversold, it can create false expectations. It oversimplifies. And in doing so, it runs the risk of making people feel broken when their transformation isn’t instant or complete.\n\nIf rewiring is easy, then why haven’t you fixed your depression? If brain change is automatic with the right programme, then why are you still struggling?\n\nThis thinking can be cruel. It ignores several factors – from the social to the environmental to the genetic – that shape and constrain neuroplasticity, many of which are only partially understood. It turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw. Some therapy models and self-help programmes lean into this pressure, implying that full transformation is just a matter of effort. But science tells a different story: change is possible, yes. But it’s constrained by biology and shaped by context.\n\nI’ve seen patients blame themselves when neuroplasticity didn’t yield a cure. People grasp at therapies that promise to rewire away disease. The language of neuroscience is being used to justify everything from educational policy to digital detox programmes with little regard for the underlying data.\n\nNone of this is to say that neuroplasticity doesn’t exist. It does. Stroke recovery, phantom limb sensation, chronic pain syndromes and even language acquisition in adults all bear its fingerprints. What’s needed is precision. Scientists must be careful with their words. Clinicians must draw clearer boundaries between science and metaphor. And the public must be equipped to discern between poetic licence and peer-reviewed truth.\n\nWhat we really need is a more honest, but still hopeful, view of brain change.\n\nIf not ‘rewiring’, then what? Perhaps the better metaphor is not a machine being repaired but a landscape being reshaped. Neuroplasticity resembles erosion and regrowth: some paths deepen, others fade, and change unfolds unevenly over time.\n\nNeuroplasticity is a remarkable capacity. It offers real hope for recovery, adaptation and growth. But it requires patience, structure, repetition and support. It is not a quick fix. It is a lifelong process that demands sustained engagement.\n\nTo honour the brain’s ability to change, we need to respect how it actually works. That means moving beyond buzzwords and shortcuts, and toward a language that reflects both the promise and the limits of biology. The brain’s capacity for change is one of the most hopeful discoveries in modern science – but that change comes not through clever metaphors or overnight programmes. It comes through effort, repetition and time. By tempering our metaphors with reality, we can help people pursue transformation with both hope and humility. Language matters. ‘Rewiring the brain’ began as a hopeful metaphor. Let’s not let it become a misleading one.\n\nYour brain does not process information, retrieve knowledge or store memories. In short: your brain is not a computer\n\nA child’s brain can master anything from language to music. Can neuroscience extend that genius across the lifespan?\n\nAs tasks mount up, our brain’s ability to juggle goes down. Neuroergonomic tactics can relieve the cognitive burden\n\nNeuroscience gives us invaluable, wondrous knowledge about the brain – including an awareness of its limitations\n\nessayCognition and intelligence\n\nBrain-training games won’t boost your IQ, but a host of strategies can improve your cognitive abilities one piece at a time\n\nIt’s not just the planet and not just our health – the impact of a warming climate extends deep into our cortical fissures",

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "fullText": "A few months ago, we released our first agentic coding model, Composer 1. Since then, we've made significant improvements to the model’s coding ability.\n\nOur new release, Composer 1.5, strikes a strong balance between speed and intelligence for daily use. Composer 1.5 was built by scaling reinforcement learning 20x further on the same pretrained model. The compute used in our post-training of Composer 1.5 even surpasses the amount used to pretrain the base model.\n\nWe see continued improvements on coding ability as we scale. Measured by our internal benchmark of real-world coding problems, we find that the model quickly surpasses Composer 1 and continues to climb in performance. The improvements are most significant on challenging tasks.\n\nComposer 1.5 is a thinking model. In the process of responding to queries, the model generates thinking tokens to reason about the user’s codebase and plan next steps. We find that these thinking stages are critical to the model’s intelligence. At the same time, we wanted to keep Composer 1.5 fast and interactive for day-to-day use. To achieve a balance, the model is trained to respond quickly on easy problems with minimal thinking, while on hard problems it will think until it has found a satisfying answer.\n\nTo handle longer running tasks, Composer 1.5 has the ability to self-summarize. This allows the model to continue exploring for a solution even when it runs out of available context. We train self-summarization into Composer 1.5 as part of RL by asking it to produce a useful summary when context runs out in training. This may trigger several times recursively on hard examples. We find that self-summarization allows the model to maintain its original accuracy as context length varies.\n\nComposer 1.5 is a significantly stronger model than Composer 1 and we recommend it for interactive use. Its training demonstrates that RL for coding can be continually scaled with predictable intelligence improvements.\n\nLearn more about Composer 1.5 pricing here.",

    "description": "The discovery prompted an international search to figure out how the ancient headstone made it to New Orleans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA nearly 2,000-year-old tombstone of a Roman sailor was discovered in the backyard of a New Orleans home.\n\nThe Latin inscription on the grave marker prompted a search for the origin story of the marble stone.\n\nThe buzz about the find in the local news led to the discovery of just how the ancient piece crossed the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis story is a collaboration with Biography.com.\n\nThe discovery of a nearly 2,000-year-old Roman sailor’s tombstone wasn’t so much an excavation as a backyard cleanup at a New Orleans home.\n\nWhen Daniella Santoro and her husband, Aaron Lorenz, started clearing away brush in the yard of their home, they uncovered a marble slab with what appeared to be a Latin inscription carved on it. In a strange turn of events, the slab turned out to be the grave marker of a Roman military sailor originally housed in an Italian museum. How it ended up 5,250 miles away is quite a journey.\n\nWhen Santoro, an anthropologist at Tulane University and the owner of the historic home on Cambronne Street in the Carrollton neighborhood in New Orleans, initially found the slab, she thought it could have been from one of the city’s historic cemeteries. She contacted D. Ryan Gray, professor of anthropology at the University of New Orleans.\n\n“I never feel like I’ve seen it all,” Gray wrote on the website of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans. “There are always surprises and new mysteries to solve.”\n\nThose new mysteries don’t often come with international intrigue that include World War II, garden decor, and the F.B.I.\n\nWith no cemeteries close by, Gray asked for help from a colleague at the University of Innsbruck and scholars at Tulane to decipher the Latin. They independently concluded that the stone featured a Roman funerary inscription for a sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus.\n\nThe second-century C.E. inscription read: “To the Spirits of the Dead for Sextus Congenius Verus, solider of the praetorian fleet Misenensis, from the tribe of the Bessi [of Thrace], (who) lived 42 years (and) served 22 in the military, on the trireme [warship] Asclepius. Atilius Carus and Vettius Longinus, his heirs, made (this) for him, well deserving.”\n\nMore shocking: this inscription was already known in the world of anthropology. “In fact, a stone fitting that exact description was missing from the city museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, near where it had originally been found,” Gray said. “This was a bit of a surprise, and it changed the scope of our inquiries.”\n\nAfter the backyard discovery and identification, the F.B.I.’s Art Crime Team got involved, picking up the one-foot-wide stone and keeping it in custody while the repatriation process kicked off to return the grave marker back to its original home.\n\nGetting the stone back to the Italian museum was one thing, but figuring out how it got to New Orleans was another.\n\nGray started investigating the owners of the home from the 20th century, when the house stayed in the same family for much of the 1900s. Thanks to the U.S. Census, Gray deduced that Frank Simon purchased the house for his family in 1909 while he was working at a wholesale shoe company. His daughters, working as seamstresses, later owned the home. But those facts provided no clues as to how a stone moved from Italy to Louisiana.\n\nWith that dead-end in place, Gray turned to the next-door neighbor, a U.S. Navy veteran who served in World War II. That, too, was a non-starter, showing he deployed in the Pacific and was never stationed in Italy.\n\nSusann Lusnia, associate professor of classical studies at Tulane, took the search to Italy, where she was already planning a summer research stint. She met with staff and curators at the city museum and learned the headstone’s original site, located northwest of Rome, was a major port for the Roman empire and remained a port into the 20th century. Allied bombing raids in 1943 and 1944 targeted the city in World War II, and the museum was destroyed and collections lost.\n\nLusnia discovered the marker was likely lost in the chaos after the war and confirmed the 34th division of the Fifth Army of the U.S. traveled through the town after liberating Rome, with units remaining in the area. At that point, Gray figured there had to be a connection between the soldiers of World War II and the slab, but he had no way of sifting through so many names.\n\nThat’s when crowdsourcing finished the job. As the local news picked up the story, a previous homeowner at the Cambronne Street site heard about the mysterious headstone and immediately made the connection, remembering placing the stone in the garden while planting a tree at her new house two decades ago.\n\n“I just thought it was a piece of art,” said Erin Scott O’Brien, according to Preservation in Print. “I had no idea it was a 2,000-year-old relic.”\n\nO’Brien’s grandfather, Charles Paddock Jr., served in the U.S. Army during World War II, stationed in Italy for a time. He returned to New Orleans in 1946 with his new wife, Adele, who he met in Italy. Charles taught at Loyola University and the tablet in question sat in a cabinet in his Baccich Street home. But with both grandparents passing in the 1980s, O’Brien didn’t know its significance. She ended up with what she thought was a decorative piece and added it to the backyard décor over two decades ago.\n\n“I was really thinking we’d have our list of possible people through whom it could have ended up here,” Gray said. “I didn’t really expect to actually find the actual person, so it’s pretty exciting to know how it ended up here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Back in May 2025, a widely followed analyst named KillaXBT posted a roadmap on X (formerly Twitter) about Bitcoin price that many traders scrolled past.\n\nThey are paying attention now. That specific BTC price prediction mapped out the cryptocurrency market structure almost perfectly, calling the top above $100,000 and the subsequent breakdown. But here is the catch: the model suggests the pain isn’t over yet.\n\nDISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026\n\nIt is rare to see a Bitcoin chart age this well. The prediction, which resurfaced recently, didn’t rely on hype or gut feelings. Instead, the analyst used something called “rotational market mathematics.”\n\nWhile that sounds intimidating, think of it simply as counting swings, like counting how many times a ball bounces before it loses energy and stops.\n\nDISCOVER: Best New Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2026\n\nKillaXBT identified that Bitcoin’s “internal liquidity cycling” was exhausted at the highs. The chart correctly predicted that once the price fell below the $100,000 level, it wouldn’t just dip; it would enter a prolonged price crash.\n\nThis aligns with what we have seen recently, as Bitcoin broke major levels as a bearish structure tightened, validating the analyst’s foresight months later.\n\nThe resurfaced chart serves as a forward-looking map, and the destination is lower than most of us want to hear.\n\nKillaXBT’s technical analysis currently suggests that Bitcoin is stuck in a “distribution band” around $70,000. In plain English? Big players are likely selling into these small rallies rather than buying for the long haul.\n\nThe model’s final stage points to a capitulation event, a moment where investors quit in frustration, targeting the $50,000 area.\n\nThis mirrors other concerns in the market, where mounting pressure has led to warnings of a Bitcoin crash to $50k from various bearish analysts. The structure indicates that the bounces we are seeing are weak and corrective, lacking the true power needed to reverse the trend.\n\nWith market sentiment hitting extreme lows, often reflected when we see Crypto Fear and Greed at multi-year lows during a crash, the environment is ripe for this kind of final wash-out.\n\nKillaXBT notes that without a “macro base” forming (a solid floor where price stops dropping for a long time), the true bottom likely isn’t in yet.\n\nDISCOVER: Top Solana Meme Coins to Buy in 2026\n\nFollow 99Bitcoins on X For the Latest Market Updates and Subscribe on YouTube For Daily Expert Market Analysis\n\nRead original story This Analyst Nailed Bitcoin Price Top, Now He Is Calling The Bottom by Ahmed Balaha at 99bitcoins.com",

We are discussing with our Cuban friends possible ways to resolve these problems, or at least to provide all possible assistance,\" said Peskov.\n\nPeskov was answering a question about jet fuel shortages and whether that might affect Russian tourists wanting to leave Cuba, a long-time ally of Moscow's.\n\nCuba warned international airlines that jet fuel would no longer ⁠be available on the island beginning on Tuesday. Air Canada ​said on Monday it was suspending flights to Cuba.\n\nRussian Foreign ​Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a message marking the day of diplomatic workers in Russia, said Moscow sought to build relations with developing countries.\n\n\"The focus remains on countering neo-colonial ‍practices, from unilateral coercive measures ⁠to military interventions,\" Lavrov wrote on his ministry's website.\n\n\"In this context, we reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Venezuela and Cuba. We are convinced that only they can determine their ⁠own destiny.\"\n\nRussia's ambassador to Cuba, Viktor Coronelli, told the state RIA news agency last week that Moscow had repeatedly supplied oil ‌to Cuba in recent years, and would continue to do so.",

    "description": "The AirFish isn’t quite a boat or a plane. Instead, it harnesses the ground effect to reduce drag as it flies from Singapore to Batam in just 25 minutes.",
    "fullText": "Singapore’s holiday-goers could soon be gliding over the sea, rather than cutting through them.\n\nAerospace firm ST Engineering debuted the AirFish, a 10-seater craft that glides around one to three meters above the water, on Feb. 3 at the Singapore Airshow.\n\n“For typical boats, there’s a lot of friction on the sea,” explains Leon Tan, vice president of ST Engineering AirX, the wing of the firm which oversees the craft’s design. The AirFish caters to travelers who “want point-to-point speed,” he tells Fortune, as it achieves a velocity of up to 100 knots (116 miles per hour), comparable to a light aircraft.\n\nWhat is ST Engineering's AirFish and how does it work?\n\nHow does the AirFish fit into ST Engineering's business strategy?\n\nWhat are ST Engineering's expansion plans for the AirFish?\n\nWhat partnerships has ST Engineering secured for the AirFish?\n\nThe AirFish harnesses the ground effect, which occurs when air becomes compressed between a wing and a surface, producing lift and reducing drag. This reduces how much energy the craft uses when it travels across the water’s surface, much like how an albatross glides for long distances with minimal energy. (The former Soviet Union was one of the largest proponents of ground-effect vehicles, which officials dubbed “ekranoplans,” and considered using as military vehicles.)\n\nST Engineering has already inked two partnerships for the AirFish, including one with ferry operator BatamFast to run trips between Singapore and the Indonesian town of Batam, with the first journeys starting in the third quarter of 2026. An AirFish can complete the journey in 25 minutes, half the time of a typical ferry.\n\nThe firm also announced on Feb. 3 that Indian operator Wings Over Water Ferries will also lease and operate up to four vessels in India by late 2026.\n\nTan, from ST Engineering, says the AirFish is part of the company’s shift toward making original equipment. Traditionally, it focuses on maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO); the company is the world’s largest airframe MRO provider, with facilities in Asia, Europe, and the U.S.\n\nWith 2024 revenue of $8.4 billion, ST Engineering is No. 33 on Fortune’s Southeast Asia 500 list, which measures the region’s largest companies by revenue. The company was founded in 1967 and stems from Singapore’s defense industry. Over the past 50 years, it’s broadened its portfolio to include aerospace and shipbuilding.\n\nST Engineering hopes to bring the AirFish to other destinations including Malaysia’s Tioman and Desaru, Tan tells Fortune. He believes that Southeast Asia’s maritime travel industry holds much potential for the AirFish, given that it has several archipelagic countries like Indonesia, which comprises over 17,000 islands, and the Philippines, which has over 7,000.\n\nThe company is also experimenting with building 24- and 36-seater AirFish crafts, which can transport more passengers on each flight, Tan says. It is also looking to build four-seater luxury AirFish crafts to cater to the ultrawealthy demographic.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "“Often, the first tactic is to deny the claim and hope the consumer goes away.”\n\nThat statement came from Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, who had recently shed some light on how car manufacturers deal with warranty claims after a Pennsylvania couple had theirs wrongly denied.\n\nAs CBS News reports, Jamie and Debbie Rekasie’s 2019 Kia Optima came with a 100,000-mile powertrain warranty. But when the engine failed at 80,000 miles, the couple says the automaker insisted the car was not properly maintained and rejected their warranty claim (1). The Rekasies, on the other hand, believe their vehicle was properly maintained, and they have the receipts to prove it.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThis story points to a worrying development, as many car owners likely don’t realize their warranty claims can be denied over things like insufficient documentation, or that consumer protection laws are on their side. Here’s what you need to know about your rights under federal warranty law and how you can challenge a denied warranty claim for your vehicle.\n\nAs they explained to CBS News, the Rekasies believe they did everything right when it comes to vehicle maintenance.\n\n“I have records,” said Jamie. “Fourteen oil changes, two sets of brakes, two sets of tires.”\n\nHowever, Kia reportedly still refused to pay for replacing the engine after the Rekasies provided the receipts. The couple’s son, who is a mechanic, performed the oil changes on the car, but Kia claims the receipts provided did not include the vehicle's VIN number or odometer reading, which led the automaker to deny the warranty claim on the basis of insufficient information.\n\nKia also stated the oil changes that the couple received went against its coverage policy; as the company shared with CBS News, Kia only approves home oil changes if the receipts list the vehicle mileage, the date, quantity of oil and an oil filter.\n\nThe Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is a federal law designed to protect consumers for a variety of products, including vehicles (2).\n\nIt’s designed to ensure that manufacturers honor their warranties fairly and even stipulates that if a consumer sues a company for failing to uphold their warranty, the manufacturer will also have to pay the consumer’s legal fees if their case is successful (3).",

    "fullText": "The best friendships are the most unexpected ones, and this adorable moment between a tiny kitten and a donkey is enough to warm anyone's heart.\n\nIn a cute video posted to TikTok from Shriver Funny Farm, a donkey and a kitten bonded together in a sweet and tender moment. In the video, the donkey leaned down to sniff at the tiny kitten. Meanwhile, the kitten did its own investigation and sniffed the donkey as well, making it look like the pair were giving each other little nose bumps.\n\nThe cute moment had users absolutely obsessed with the \"wholesome\" moment between the most unlikely pair of friends.\n\n🐶\nA few users even compared them to Donkey and Puss in Boots from Shrek, with one user even commenting a photo of the characters.\n\nOther users loved the sweet moment, with another user writing, \"They’re going to be besties 🥰.\" Another added, \"Animals are so pure.\"\n\nOne other user mused that they \"wish I had a barn just to have barn cats\" that would befriend the other farm animals.\n\nUnlikely bonds and friendships between different animal species are more common than you may think, especially on a farm.\n\nAccording to BBC Earth, animals that especially live in close quarters together will \"turn to each other for entertainment if companions from their own species are thin on the ground.\"\n\nSo a friendship between a donkey and a kitten is not as far-fetched as it may seem at first glance.\n\nBut donkeys, especially, are known to be intelligent and sentient, with strong social bonds and a gentle nature, according to the World Animal Protection organization. Donkeys also have a sharp sense of smell, which helps them understand their surroundings and even bond with other animals.\n\nLike donkeys, cats, notorious for their curiosity, also use their sense of smell to understand their surroundings. PetCareRX reveals that a kitten's sense of smell fully develops at four weeks. As kittens, they will rely on smell and their other senses to understand the world around them until their sight is fully developed at five weeks.",

    "fullText": "Supporters of transgender rights gather at the Legislative Office Building in Concord last year, on Feb. 19, 2025. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)\n\nGov. Kelly Ayotte vetoed Senate Bill 268 Friday, a bill to allow transgender people to be excluded from restrooms, locker rooms, jails, and other spaces that don’t match their sex at birth.\n\n“I vetoed a nearly identical bill to this one last year,” Ayotte, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the veto. “I made it clear this issue needed to be addressed in a thoughtful, narrow way that protects the privacy, safety, and rights of all Granite Staters. Unfortunately, there is minimal difference between Senate Bill 268 and the bill I vetoed last year, which Governor Sununu vetoed the year prior.”\n\nLike 2025’s House Bill 148 and 2024’s House Bill 396, the Republican-backed SB 268 sought to create exceptions to the state’s antidiscrimination law, which was enacted in 2018 and protects people from discrimination on the basis of “gender identity” and other characteristics. In addition to allowing businesses and organizations to separate restrooms, locker rooms, and jails by sex at birth rather than self-expressed gender identity, the bills would’ve allowed schools to keep transgender girls off boys sports teams and vice versa.\n\nIn 2025, Ayotte endorsed some of the conservative lawmakers’ goals, but ultimately vetoed the legislation on the grounds that it was impractical.\n\n“I believe there are important and legitimate privacy and safety concerns raised by biological males using places such as female locker rooms and being placed in female correctional facilities,” Ayotte wrote at the time. “At the same time, I see that House Bill 148 is overly broad and impractical to enforce, potentially creating an exclusionary environment for some of our citizens.”\n\nIn December, conservatives failed to garner the votes necessary to override the governor’s veto.\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed another similar bill in the final year of his tenure. Sununu, also a Republican, wrote in 2024 as he vetoed HB 396 that the bill “runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit,” and “seeks to solve problems that have not presented themselves.” The Legislature also failed to overturn that veto.",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood said she would favor Bitcoin over gold.\n\nPeter Schiff has fired back at Wood on X.\n\nWood reaffirmed ARK Invest’s long-term Bitcoin thesis.\n\nCathie Wood, chief executive of ARK Invest, said traders should consider shifting from gold into Bitcoin (BTC) — leading to a public pushback from famed gold advocate Peter Schiff.\n\nSpeaking on The Rundown podcast on Feb. 1, Wood argued that precious metals’ current price levels are difficult to justify outside periods of extreme economic stress.\n\n“If I were a betting person, I would make a shift from gold into Bitcoin,” Wood said.\n\nSpeaking on the podcast, Wood noted that gold has historically surged during periods such as the Great Depression and the high-inflation era of the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nHowever, she emphasized that current conditions do not resemble either of those times.\n\n“Gold is probably ripe for a fall,” Wood said, pointing out that during the Great Depression, the U.S. government devalued the dollar against gold and confiscated private holdings.\n\nWhile she did not offer direct investment advice, Wood said she would personally favor Bitcoin over gold, citing its long-term role as a store of value.\n\nShe added that although stablecoins have assumed some of Bitcoin’s transactional role in emerging markets, she sees that as a temporary trend.\n\n“When people want real savings, they’re going to buy Bitcoin,” she said.\n\nThe comments drew a sharp response from long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Sunday.\n\n“Cathie Wood is a fool,” Schiff wrote in a post on X.\n\nAdding: “Most people won’t realize that until they go broke following her advice.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, Schiff added: “You can’t say I’ve never been right. The most bullish Bitcoin promoters have now been wrong for years.”\n\nSchiff has consistently argued that gold remains a superior store of value compared with Bitcoin and other forms of crypto, warning that BTC’s price gains are driven largely by speculation.\n\nDespite the criticism, Wood has repeatedly defended her firm’s Bitcoin thesis and remained bullish on its long-term price growth.\n\nWood reiterated ARK Invest’s long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, pointing to the firm’s “bull case” price target of $1.5 million by 2030.\n\n“Digital gold contributes the most to our bear and base cases,” ARK wrote in its Big Ideas 2025 report. “Institutional investment drives our bull case.”\n\nDespite Wood claiming that stablecoins have taken up some of the role “we thought that Bitcoin would play,” she has remained strong on the firm’s long-term target.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — The final two of nearly 30 civil lawsuits that Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson had faced from women accusing him of sexual misconduct have been dismissed, according to court records.\n\nThe dismissal of these two lawsuits clears Watson of legal problems he had been facing since 2021 after 27 women came forward and accused him in court filings in Texas of exposing himself, touching them with his genitals or kissing them against their will, mostly during massage appointments.\n\nSome of the women alleged Watson, 30, forced them to perform oral sex and one woman accused him of sexually assaulting her.\n\nThe dismissals come as both lawsuits had been set to go to trial in the next few weeks. The accusations against Watson were made when he played for the Houston Texans.\n\nIt is believed that Watson has no other lawsuits pending in connection with the sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nOne of the lawsuits that was dismissed on Friday has been settled, said Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the woman who had filed it. Buzbee declined to comment further, citing confidentiality of the settlement agreement. Buzbee's client alleged Watson touched her with his penis multiple times during a massage session.\n\nIt was not immediately known if the other dismissed lawsuit had also been settled. Anissah Nguyen, an attorney for the woman who filed the lawsuit, didn’t immediately respond to an email or call seeking comment. Nguyen's client had accused Watson of pressuring her to perform oral sex during a massage.\n\nWatson’s attorneys declined to comment.\n\nWatson, who was traded to the Browns in March 2022, has long denied any wrongdoing, and two separate Texas grand juries declined to indict him. One of his attorneys, Rusty Hardin, had previously said the allegations against Watson were “meritless.”\n\n“I don’t remember or recall any sexual encounters with her,” Watson said in a 2023 deposition he gave while being questioned about the woman represented by Nguyen.\n\nThe woman represented by Nguyen had also sued the Houston Texans, alleging Watson had assaulted women with the help and resources of the team. The lawsuit against the Texans was also dismissed last week.\n\nA spokesperson for the Texans didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nIn July 2022, 30 women who had accused the Texans of turning a blind eye to allegations against their former star quarterback settled their legal claims against the team.\n\nIt was not unusual that all the cases against Watson were settled, said David Ring, a California-based attorney who is not connected to the lawsuits and who has represented victims of sexual assault. He said the majority of civil lawsuits are typically resolved before going to trial and that high-profile defendants typically don’t want cases to play out in a public courtroom.\n\n“He’s trying to put all of this behind him,” Ring said.\n\nWatson’s legal problems began after dozens of women claimed to have been the victims of sexual misconduct or assault between 2017 and 2020.\n\nMost of the lawsuits against Watson were settled in 2022.\n\nFollowing the allegations, Watson was suspended for the first 11 games in 2022 for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.\n\nWatson was also fined $5 million and underwent a mandatory evaluation before being reinstated by the league. He has played in only 19 games for the Browns due to the NFL suspension and injuries.\n\nFollow Juan A. Lozano: https://x.com/juanlozano70",

    "description": "\"I can never go back.\"",
    "fullText": "Scientists are warning that Himalayan glacial lakes are becoming a growing threat to communities downstream as \"too little snow and too much rain\" destabilize the region's terrain.\n\nThulagi Glacial Lake, at the base of the retreating Thulagi Glacier near Mount Manaslu in Nepal, has expanded over the past few decades as surrounding ice melted, the Nepali Times reported.\n\nOnce a small pool in the 1960s, the lake is now more than 1 square kilometer (nearly 250 acres) and holds close to 10 billion gallons of water.\n\nScientists have classified Thulagi as one of the most dangerous glacial lakes in the Himalayas, among 47 others on an ICIMOD watchlist. They fear a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), a sudden release of water triggered by landslides, ice collapse, or weakening natural dams.\n\n\"The lake will burst sooner or later,\" local guide Chandra Bahadur Gurung told the Nepali Times.\n\nA 2018 study followed the evolution of three glacial lakes, including Thulagi, finding that a GLOF from Thulagi posed a risk to communities and four hydropower projects downstream.\n\nRising global temperatures — driven by the production and use of oil, gas, and coal — are raising the risks of melting and devastating GLOFs.\n\nModeling showed that if Thulagi were to burst, floodwaters could reach downstream towns within hours, with surges over 40 feet in some locations. Entire villages could be wiped out, roads and bridges destroyed, and rivers permanently rerouted.\n\nResidents in Nepal's Manang district still carry trauma from flooding in 2021, when heavy rainfall led to surging water in the Marsyangdi River.\n\n\"I did not know if I would live or die,\" one hotel owner recalled after watching water tear through his village.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"The Marsyangdi flows through my house now,\" said Kamarkali Gurung. \"I can never go back.\"\n\nExtreme weather events like these destroy and disrupt livelihoods, tourism, agriculture, and energy production for vulnerable communities.\n\nExtreme rainfall in the region has already devastated farms in Nepal and doubled food prices for families, and past GLOFs have washed away homes and healthcare clinics and taken lives.\n\nBeyond immediate destruction, flooding can contaminate drinking water, spread disease, and destabilize ecosystems that communities depend on for fishing and farming.\n\nIt wasn't until the 2021 floods that early warning systems were installed on the banks of the Marsyangdi River and nearby towns.\n\nHowever, there is currently little preparation beyond that, and no warning systems cover Thulagi.\n\nLast year, the Green Climate Fund approved a $36.1 million grant to help reduce the risk of GLOFs by reducing water levels in four glacial lakes, including Thulagi, under the United Nations Development Program.\n\nGlobally, scientists stress that protecting vulnerable communities requires coordinated multinational efforts to slow ice loss, invest in resilient infrastructure, transition to clean energy, and plan relocations only when necessary.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela's top prosecutor said on Monday that his office had requested the arrest of one of the closest allies of opposition leader María Corina Machado, less than 12 hours after his release from a detention facility as part of a government move to free those facing politically motivated accusations.\n\nThe attorney general’s statement did not say whether Juan Pablo Guanipa was rearrested, or give indication of his whereabouts. The government had released him along with several other prominent opposition members on Sunday following lengthy politically motivated detentions.\n\nAttorney General Tarek William Saab's office posted on social media that it had “requested the competent court to revoke the precautionary measure granted to Juan Pablo Guanipa, due to his non-compliance with the conditions imposed by the aforementioned court.”\n\nIt did not elaborate on what conditions Guanipa, a former governor for the opposition, violated during the hours he was free, but said authorities were seeking house arrest.\n\nGuanipa's son, Ramón, told reporters Monday that a group of men in three vehicles intercepted his father and others traveling around 11:45 p.m. Sunday in a neighborhood in the capital, Caracas. They were armed with long guns and wore civilian clothes and bulletproof vests.\n\nRamón Guanipa said authorities have not yet notified him of his father's whereabouts and their decision to place him on house arrest. He said his father did not violate the two conditions of his release — monthly check-ins with a court and no travel outside Venezuela — and showed reporters the court document listing them.\n\nThe development marked the latest twist in the political turmoil in Venezuela in the wake of the U.S. military's seizure on Jan. 3 of then-President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from a military base compound in Caracas in a stunning operation that landed them in New York to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\nThe government of Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodríguez began releasing prisoners days after she was sworn in and has faced mounting pressure to free hundreds of people whose detentions months or years ago have been linked to their political activities. The releases also followed a visit to Venezuela of representatives of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nVenezuelan-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal confirmed the release of at least 30 people Sunday.\n\nSome of those freed Sunday joined families waiting outside detention facilities for their loved ones. They chanted “We are not afraid! We are not afraid!” and marched a short distance.\n\n“I am convinced that our country has completely changed,” Guanipa told reporters after his release. “I am convinced that it is now up to all of us to focus on building a free and democratic country.”\n\nGuanipa had spent more than eight months in custody at a facility in Caracas.\n\n“My father cannot be a criminal ... simply for making statements,” Ramón Guanipa said. \"How much longer will speaking out be a crime in this country?”\n\nSeveral members of Machado’s political organization were among the released Sunday, including attorney Perkins Rocha and local organizer María Oropeza, who had in 2024 livestreamed her arrest by military intelligence officers as they broke into her home with a crowbar. Rocha was released to house arrest.\n\n“They are terrified that Venezuelan society will mobilize and express its voice civically,” Machado, referring to Rodríguez's government, told reporters Monday in Washington. “But let me tell you something, there’s no going back... What will Juan Pablo become now? What will Perkins become as a prisoner in his own home? A reference in this fight.”\n\nLong detentions for political activities\n\nGuanipa was detained in late May and accused by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello of participating in an alleged “terrorist group” that was plotting to boycott that month’s legislative election. Guanipa’s brother Tomás rejected the accusation, and said the arrest was meant to crack down on dissent.\n\nRodríguez’s government announced Jan. 8 that it would free a significant number of those arrested — a central demand of the country’s opposition and human rights organizations with backing from the United States — but families and rights watchdogs have criticized authorities for the slow pace of the releases.\n\nThe ruling party-controlled National Assembly last week began debating an amnesty bill that could lead to the release of hundreds. The opposition and nongovernmental organizations have reacted with cautious optimism as well as with suggestions and demands \n\nNational Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez, who is the acting president's brother, on Friday posted a video on Instagram showing him outside a detention center in Caracas and saying that “everyone” would be released no later than next week, once the amnesty bill is approved.\n\nDelcy Rodríguez, the acting president, and Volker Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, spoke by phone in late January. His spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, in a statement said he sent a team to the country and “offered our support to help Venezuela work on a road map for dialogue and reconciliation\" in which human rights should be centered.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing collaboration between The Associated Press and FRONTLINE (PBS) that includes an upcoming documentary.",

    "fullText": "GRAND JUNCTION Colo. (KREX)- A 41-year-old Grand Junction man suffered life-threatening injuries early Sunday when his vehicle rolled after striking a horse on Interstate 70 near Fruita, authorities said.\n\nThe crash happened around 1:37 a.m. in the eastbound lanes of I-70 at mile marker 22, according to the Colorado State Patrol. Troopers said a horse entered the roadway and was struck by multiple vehicles.\n\nThe man, driving a Toyota Land Cruiser, was the first to hit the horse. His vehicle rolled and came to rest on its roof, trapping him inside, state patrol officials said. He was taken to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries.\n\n“After impact, the Land Cruiser ended up rolling, coming to rest on its roof,” a Colorado State Patrol Trooper Gabriel Moltrer said. “That driver was transported to an area hospital for life-threatening injuries.”\n\nThe driver has been identified through a GoFundMe as Kyle Freud out of Grand Junction, who friends describe as a husband, father and longtime member of the Land Cruiser and off-road community.\n\nA second vehicle, a Ford F-250 driven by a 17-year-old male from Peyton, also struck the horse. That driver was not injured, authorities said. The horse died at the scene.\n\nEastbound lanes of I-70 were closed for several hours while crews worked to remove the vehicles and clear the roadway. The Colorado Department of Transportation assisted with the cleanup, and the highway reopened shortly before 5 a.m.\n\nOfficials urge drivers to use caution on rural highways, especially during overnight and early morning hours when animals are more active.\n\n“When you see an animal in the roadway, brake firmly. Don’t swerve,” said Chuck Marsh, regional communications manager for CDOT. “The last thing you want to do is end up in oncoming traffic or off the road.”\n\nState patrol officials have not confirmed where the horse came from. The crash remains under investigation.",

    "description": "What happened between them?",
    "fullText": "President Trump is notorious for his emotional ups and downs and for turning on people on a dime. So, it’s not surprising that someone like Jeff Bezos would be trying hard to stay in the President’s good graces. This entire presidency, we’ve seen business leaders from all sides of the political aisle try to integrate themselves with Trump, because that’s beneficial for their business. Business first, morals later. Or something.\n\nNow, there are reports that the recent layoffs at the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, might have had something to do with Trump. Martin Baron, former executive editor of the Post, told Jen Psaki on “The Briefing” that the layoffs were related to Trump.\n\nBad Bunny's Real Feelings About Trump Resurface as the President Calls His Super Bowl Performance 'Disgusting' & the 'Worst Ever'\n\nGreen Day Just Called Out Trump After the President Refused to Attend the Super Bowl & Called Them a 'Terrible Choice'\n\nAccording to Barron, when he joined the Washington Post in 2013, “It was a great news organization then,” even if “it had faced many challenges.\n\n“[Bezos] acquired the paper about a year after I had been there. He invested. He spoke on behalf of the mission of the Post. He spoke on behalf of the mission of the press in this country,” he said, adding that the paper “grew under the ownership” of Bezos.\n\nBut he was clear that the layoffs “represent a turn back.”\n\n“It suggests that this newspaper, with a deep heritage and historically high ambitions, is going to retreat,” he explained. “And it’s a terrible thing to see a news organization that’s been so important to the history of this country retreat the way that this newspaper is doing.”\n\nAll of this, Baron said, can be traced back to Trump. “I explain it by saying the words ‘Donald Trump.’ That’s what happened.”\n\n“Trump came into office again,” Baron said. “He had promised vengeance against his perceived political enemies. Jeff Bezos was seen as a political enemy by Donald Trump for one reason and one reason only, and that was the coverage of the Washington Post.”\n\nAnd that coverage was, of course, not always positive. Baron was clear that he believed Bezos feared repercussions for him and his business due to the Washington Post’s reporting.\n\nWhen Trump returned to the White House, Baron said he believed Bezos was afraid the administration would target him and his other businesses for the Post’s journalism. “And so he has sought to navigate this administration during the second term,” Baron explained. And that apparently means scaling back the negative coverage of Trump and moving more towards the center, something Baron was very critical of. This is also something that has been pointed out by many others as over 300 journalists were fired from the Washington Post in recent days, with the entirety of the books and sports section and most of its international coverage being shut down.\n\n“This is a newspaper that has prided itself on its independence, and the behavior of Jeff Bezos has suggested to the readers that he is not independent at all,” Baron said. “He’s actually dependent — dependent on Donald Trump.”\n\nNot a good sign for one of the most important newspapers in the country, one whose logline is: Democracy Dies in Darkness.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "description": "\"Well, initially, my reaction to all this was, ‘I don't care. I don't know what the big deal is.’ But now I see what the big deal is\"",
    "fullText": "Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) told Congressional reporter Pablo Manríquez on Monday that she now supports the full release of the Epstein files after expressing shock at the inclusion of a potentially nine-year-old victim in the latest document dump.\n\n“I’ve not been one of the members who has glommed on to this as an issue. I’ve sort of intentionally deferred to others to find out about it. But nine-year-old victims—” Lummis told Manríquez, expressing shock and horror at the revelation.\n\nManríquez jumped in and added, “All over the world—Moscow is saying it was sort of like a real global network that they’re now getting to see on these four terminals they have.” The terminals refer to the Department of Justice computers that members of Congress are being allowed to view the unredacted Epstein files on.\n\n“Wow. Well, initially, my reaction to all this was, ‘I don’t care. I don’t know what the big deal is.’ But now I see what the big deal is, and it was worth investigating. And the members of Congress that have been pushing this were not wrong. So that’s really my only reaction,” Lummis added.\n\nLummis’s remarks are a notable break from President Donald Trump’s position on the Epstein files and the House Republicans who pushed for their release, including Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) – who Trump has vowed to run out of office. “It’s all been a big hoax, it’s perpetrated by the Democrats,” Trump said last year about the effort to release the files. “And some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net. And so they try and do the Democrats’ work. The Democrats are good for nothing other than these hoaxes.”\n\nLummis announced late last year that she will not seek reelection and is leaving politics when her term ends in January 2027.\n\nReporter is @PabloReports https://t.co/OMxvXzQMvs\n\n— Pablo Manríquez (@PabloReports) February 9, 2026\n\nThe post GOP Senator Changes Tune On Epstein Files Release: ‘Now I See What the Big Deal Is’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Smartwool combined the natural temperature-regulating, moisture-wicking, and odor-resisting properties of wool with an innovative Core Spun knitting technique to create Merino 150 Boxer Briefs — a durable and comfortable pair of underwear that can be worn year-round.",
    "fullText": "\"The very first time I put on a pair of Tommy John Boxer Briefs, I couldn't help but notice they were substantially longer than other boxers. It was a bit weird visually and it took a few minutes to get used to having material that far down my leg, but I came to appreciate the length almost immediately,\" says men's style editor Amir Ismael. \n\nThe Second Skin boxer briefs are as light as air and exceptionally comfortable yet supportive. It's details like horizontal \"Quick Draw\" fly, front contour pouch, and won't-budge waistband that also make them a clear winner. They make boxer briefs with both stretchy, no-pill Modal fabric as well as a cooling pima cotton, with our favorite being the just-short-of-mid-thigh 8-inch cut.\n\nRead our full Tommy John review for further insight into what makes these our absolute favorite brand for men's underwear.\n\nBombas makes some of the best boxer briefs (and of course, socks) with a second mission in mind – for every pair purchased, they donate special Bombas underwear to homeless shelters. And the quality really stacks up, especially with the brand's soft, stretchy, dependable cotton Modal underwear. It holds its shape over time and feels lighter than traditional cotton.\n\n\"The material itself feels soft against skin, but other design elements like minimal seams, no tags, and a wide waistband also add to the comfort. I like my underwear to have a fly and Bombas' diagonal fly is unlike any other design I've seen; it provides easy access and gets the job done,\" says Amir.\n\nRead more about what TIME once called a best style invention in our full Bombas underwear review.\n\nFor a company that hung its hat on its underwear and T-shirts, Mack Weldon now makes daily office wear, from chinos to dress shirts.  And while their quality workwear is impressive, we must talk about what goes underneath. Mack Weldon's best boxer briefs use their trademark AIRKNITx fabric, a special weave and fiber that provides next-level breathability and air flow.\n\n\"I wear them during shorter jogs, during travel, and pretty much any time I want to keep things in place, as it were, when on the go (intense workouts or multi-mile runs aside),\" writes freelance author Steven John.\n\nThere's a wide range of colors to suit every preference, but it's the performance details like the \"targeted cool zones\" that make a difference.\n\nSee our full Mack Weldon review, where we found that they withstand years of wear and washing.\n\nIf you aim to dress for an active lifestyle on all fronts, you're very likely going to love Saxx. Saxx dials in all the details, starting with a range of eye-catching colors and prints that inspire confidence – but it's about more than just looks. Compression, comfort and performance are paramount, as Saxx boxer briefs have an exceptionally supportive trademark design.\n\n\"The cleverly named 'BallPark Pouch' is the most notable design element of a pair of Saxx underwear. The simple, yet innovative technology consists of two little flaps of fabric that keep a man's legs and his business separated,\" writes former senior reporter Owen Burke. \"'The Pouch' also helps prevent the buildup of moisture down there, reducing irritation, odor, and general annoyance.\"\n\nThe Vibe's materials reduce chafing and wicks away moisture for ventilated security, great for if you prefer a close fit or need underwear specifically for exercising. They're also built with a shorter, streamlined 5-inch inseam that moves easily beneath slim trousers and even athletic shorts.\n\nRead more about what six guys felt about their men's underwear in our full Saxx review.\n\nAt $12 a pair, Jockey's boxer briefs beat out other comparable pairs in terms of price. But beyond that, you'll find multiple reasons to score some new pairs from this long-running brand. There's the company's deep experience with making men's basics, of course. But they're going even more modern these days, using soft stretch organic cotton, keyhole fly, and a 6.5-inch inseam for a  streamlined, close-fitting design that works well with slimmer trousers and shorts. There are also design details like a tag-free back and stay-put legs that won't ride up.\n\nMeUndies might not have been one of the first clothing subscription services for basics, but they're certainly one of the best. The company uses super-soft, comfortable MicroModal (a more eco-friendly alternative to rayon) to build its boxer briefs, of which you can customize inseam, fly closure, or inclusion of their signature \"Ball Caddy Pouch\". Special-edition designs, colors, prints and patterns dot the MeUndies Web site. These pairs are also size and gender-inclusive to suit everybody.\n\nYou can build your own bundle and mix and match to your heart's content, or choose a surprise bundle. Another convenient option is signing up for MeUndies' monthly rolling subscription service.\n\nRead more about the perks of their bundles in our full MeUndies review.\n\nBoxer briefs are widely thought of as the most practical everyday underwear choice for men. Since boxer briefs more closely hug the skin, they work equally well with slim-fit or slim-straight pants, from blue jeans to corduroys. Boxer briefs are also a wise choice with suit pants, since more formal trousers follow the line of your leg.\n\nEven though boxer briefs hug the thigh, they should feel like an effortless protective layer for daily activities like commuting or lounging, while also providing enough ventilation to keep you cool and comfortable during nights out. Moisture-wicking, compression pairs are best suited for active pursuits like moderate hiking or outdoor exercise. \n\nMost boxer briefs feature an inseam between 6 and 8 inches, which should hit mid-thigh for a stay-put fit. You'll find that boxer briefs forgo the typical button fly of the best boxers for men, and some are designed with no fly or even a horizontal fly, like Tommy John's. The best boxer briefs are also defined by a secure fit – look for a waistband that's made from smooth elastic, one that's wide enough to not roll over or bunch up.",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn, 41, says she has \"no regrets\" about her Olympics comeback despite her crash during the women's alpine downhill competition on Sunday.\n\nThe US alpine skier was about 13 seconds into her downhill run when she clipped a gate with her arm, lost control, and tumbled down the slope before landing on her back. She was then airlifted off the course and later underwent surgery at a local hospital.\n\nVonn's fall at the Olympics on Sunday came just over a week after she tore her ACL in a crash at the Alpine Ski World Cup.\n\nIn a statement posted to her Instagram page on Monday, Vonn said her Olympic dreams did not end in the way she thought they would. \n\n\"I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever,\" Vonn wrote in the caption of her post, which was accompanied by a photo taken moments before she lost control during Sunday's race.\n\nA post shared by L I N D S E Y • V O N N (@lindseyvonn)\n\n\"Unfortunately, I sustained a complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly,\" she said.\n\nThe opportunity to compete at the Olympics and knowing she had \"a chance to win was a victory in and of itself,\" she added.\n\n\"While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets. Standing in the starting gate yesterday was an incredible feeling that I will never forget,\" Vonn wrote.\n\nThe athlete also said she was aware of all the risks involved in he sport.\n\n\"And similar to ski racing, we take risks in life. We dream. We love. We jump. And sometimes we fall. Sometimes our hearts are broken. Sometimes we don't achieve the dreams we know we could have. But that is the also the beauty of life; we can try,\" Vonn wrote.\n\nVonn is a three-time Olympic medalist who made her debut at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games. The Milan Cortina Games is her fifth Olympics.\n\nShe initially announced that she was retiring from the sport in 2019.\n\n\"My body is broken beyond repair and it isn't letting me have the final season I dreamed of. My body is screaming at me to STOP and it's time for me to listen,\" Vonn wrote in a post on Instagram.\n\nHowever, just months after undergoing a right-knee replacement surgery, Vonn told The New York Times in 2024 that she was planning to train with the US ski team again.\n\nIn the wake of her latest injury from Sunday's crash, Vonn's comeback has prompted concern from those closest to her, including her father.\n\n\"She's 41 years old and this is the end of her career,\" her father Alan Kildow told the AP on Monday. \"There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.\"\n\nDespite that, Kildow, who is a former ski racer himself, said his daughter is holding up emotionally.\n\n\"She's a very strong individual,\" Kildow said. \"She knows physical pain and she understands the circumstances that she finds herself in. And she's able to handle it. Better than I expected. She's a very, very strong person. And so I think she's handling it real well.\"\n\nHe added that she won't be returning to the Olympics, even to cheer on her teammates: \"She will be going home at an appropriate point in time.\"",

    "fullText": "Vibe coding everything is just not worth it, says an Andressen Horowitz partner.\n\nOn an episode of the \"20VC\" podcast released on Monday, A16z general partner Anish Acharya said that companies shouldn't use AI-assisted coding for every part of their business.\n\nHe said that software accounts for 8% to 12% of a company's expenses, so using vibe coding to build the company's resource planning or payroll tools would only save about 10%. Relying on AI to write code also carries risks, he said.\n\n\"You have this innovation bazooka with these models. Why would you point it at rebuilding payroll or ERP or CRM,\" Acharya said, referring to enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management software. Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP are among the top providers of such software.\n\nInstead, companies are better off using AI to develop their core businesses or optimize the remaining 90% of their costs, said the venture capitalist of six years.\n\n\"Of course, there will be secular losers. There are specific business models that are now going to be disadvantaged,\" he said. \"But the general story that we're going to vibe code everything is flat wrong, and the whole market is oversold software.\"\n\nAcharya's comments follow a brutal week for software stocks, which dragged down tech and broader markets. The sell-off started when already-wary investors panicked about Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical tasks for people working in the legal industry.\n\nThe A16z partner joins famed investor Vinod Khosla in saying that stock prices should be ignored when evaluating the future of tech companies.\n\nOn a podcast last month, Khosla dismissed talks of an AI bubble and said investors should not be concerned as long as API call volume, a benchmark of AI usage, remains high.\n\n\"If that's your fundamental metric of what's the real use of your AI, usefulness of AI, demand for AI, you're not going to see a bubble in API calls,\" he said. \"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care. I think it's mostly irrelevant.\"",

    "description": "Sr. Lt. Serhii Andrieiev told Business Insider that the cold can disrupt anything from the drone's camera lens, to its battery, to its aerodynamics.",
    "fullText": "Extreme winter temperatures can pose an onslaught of technical challenges for drone operators on Ukraine's front lines, a local drone commander said as his country was hit by a cold snap.\n\nSr. Lt. Serhii Andrieiev, deputy commander of the \"Kraken\" drone company in the 3rd Army Corps, told Business Insider that the cold can heavily disrupt reconnaissance and first-person-view attack drones because their parts often aren't designed to withstand such conditions.\n\n\"Their behavior is unpredictable, how they will operate in the frost. It's a bit, kind of like Russian roulette,\" Andrieiev said. \"Will it work, or will it fall on the field?\"\n\nMany drones in Ukraine are built with off-the-shelf components ordered online. The freewheeling nature of the supply market means it's difficult to assess how consistently each individual part performs in the cold, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"These components are serially manufactured components. They are not mil-spec components. They are cheap, and well, most of them are from China,\" he said.\n\nHe said Ukrainian units have learned to adapt, but these issues can delay critical missions or add to mental strain for troops already dealing with harsh weather. Such challenges also imply risks for other militaries seeking to bolster their drone forces, especially as concerns grow that potential new wars may spill into the Arctic regions.\n\nAndrieiev was speaking as Ukraine had just experienced one of its coldest weeks since the full-scale war began. Average temperatures in the first week of February dropped to about -19°C, or -2.2°F.\n\nIn Kharkiv, where Andrieiev's troops are fighting, some nights registered temperatures as low as -6°F.\n\nAlmost every part of the drone is susceptible to such cold. For example, Andrieiev said, low temperatures can significantly reduce the voltage of its battery, causing it to die more quickly when used at full capacity.\n\n\"You can't predict the behavior of this battery. To switch on the drone, no problem. The problem starts when it flies and hits the maximum power of its battery,\" Andrieiev said.\n\nA bigger issue arises because the drone generates heat as it flies. When it's cold out, the temperature gap between the aircraft's internal structure and the environment puts stress on its electronics and motors.\n\nThe drone can also get wet through condensation, disrupting its wiring or fogging up its lenses. Even aerodynamics can be affected when frost and small icicles grow on the chassis or propellers.\n\nThe result can be frustrating for the drone pilot, Andrieiev said. Sometimes, they watch helplessly as their drone, still transmitting footage to their screen, crashes to the ground or into a tree because a component fails.\n\n\"You identify your target, you should hit the target. You prepare your drone, drone is starting, drone flying to target, and just in the middle of the flight, it falls to the ground. And that's it,\" he said.\n\nWhen his units receive drones that aren't working well in the cold, they typically return the entire batch to the manufacturer and request improvements.\n\nWhile Andrieiev said that quality issues are becoming \"much less of a problem\" for Ukrainian drone manufacturers, returning drones costs valuable time.\n\n\"It takes time, and you should have a buffer stock of those components and drones, so that you can replace it faster than the manufacturer,\" he said.\n\nOther equipment for attack drones, such as antennae, transmitters, or supporting relay drones that extend signals, can also fail. Hair-thin fiber-optic cables used to circumvent Russian jamming need to be high-quality to avoid damage from the frost as well, he added.\n\n\"The FPV drone is just one link, one element of this whole system,\" Andrieiev said.",

    "description": "To Andre Neveling, the hippy vibe in Bali feels less like a genuine search for peace and more like an overdone tourist trend.",
    "fullText": "My obsession with travel began early. While other kids plastered their walls with posters of pop stars, I pinned up a world map.\n\nGrowing up in South Africa, international travel felt like a distant dream. But everything changed in my early 20s. After saving up from my first job, I finally took my first trip abroad. It was a chilly journey to London to see the Spice Girls reunite — one of my childhood dreams.\n\nThat trip ignited a passion in me that's never faded.\n\nSince then, I've seized every opportunity to explore, whether for work or leisure. And while many destinations have lived up to their hype, some have left me wishing I'd kept those dreams in my imagination.\n\nHaving traveled to 40 countries and counting, I've learned that some places, no matter how iconic, are better left as daydreams. These are five destinations that left me disappointed.\n\nBack in 2010, a three-day layover in Cairo on an EgyptAir flight from London to Johannesburg felt like destiny calling. I'd always been mesmerized by ancient Egypt's pharaohs, myths, and architecture. Stepping off the plane, however, the Egypt of my imagination vanished almost instantly.\n\nIn its place was a sprawling, brown city of intense heat, dilapidation, and overwhelming frenzy. From the moment I left the airport, I felt like a walking target. Every interaction, from a forced perfume-shop detour to navigating the aggressive markets, felt like a potential scam.\n\nAnd then, there they were. The Pyramids of Giza. They are, undeniably, breathtaking. More massive, more majestic, more impossible than any picture could capture. Standing before them, I felt a genuine awe I will never forget. But the magic was short-lived.\n\nTurning around, the view was dominated by fast-food joints directly across from the Sphinx. The air was thick not with ancient mystery, but with the shouts of hundreds of vendors and the exhaust of countless tour buses. Even the famous Nile River turned out to be a polluted dump, with a stench so foul that Baby Moses would rot in his little basket.\n\nParis has always been the epitome of romance and beauty — at least in my mind. Since my university days, when I studied French, I'd dreamed of walking along the Seine, gazing up at the Eiffel Tower, and experiencing the city of love firsthand. It was my top European destination, and I imagined it would be a fairy tale. Reality hit hard.\n\nParis has a certain grittiness about it. I never felt the same sense of safety I've felt in other major European capitals. And while Parisian rudeness is legendary, experiencing it firsthand was still a shock. How a city's people could be so blatantly ill-mannered toward foreign tourists blew my mind.\n\nOf course, there's the Eiffel Tower, which is indeed majestic from a distance. But up close, you're met with never-ending lines, security checks, and crowds. Venturing to the top unlocked a vertigo I never knew I possessed — the iconic view was barely a consolation for my white-knuckled grip on the railing.\n\nIf travel was my first love, showbiz was my second. Like millions, I grew up on a diet of American movies and TV that painted Hollywood as a glittering, otherworldly paradise of palm trees and perpetual glamour. To walk the Hollywood Walk of Fame was the ultimate dream.\n\nBut Hollywood isn't all glitz and glamour. The reality was a stark contrast to the movies I'd loved. The opulence is there, but so is poverty, grime, and a suffocating mass of tourists. My heart sank to see homeless people on the stars I'd dreamed of exploring.\n\nAnd the iconic Hollywood sign, while undeniably cool to spot in the hills, is almost impossible to photograph. Despite trying numerous times over the years, my last attempt in 2019 ended with me once again lost in the hills, with zero phone signal, dehydrated, and surrounded by rattlesnakes.\n\nBali is sold as the \"Eat, Pray, Love\" island paradise for spiritual awakening and rustic, tropical bliss. But what I found felt more like a well-branded spiritual-industrial complex.\n\nThe reality is an island straining under mass tourism: notorious traffic clogging tiny roads, drunk and rowdy Australians, and hordes of inexperienced tourists wobbling on scooters.\n\nWorst of all, for me, is the performative \"enlightenment.\" The hippy vibe feels less like a genuine search for peace and more like an overdone tourist trend.\n\nDuring a visit last year, I attended a meditation session where the man next to me, bare-chested with long flowing hair, turned over and introduced himself as Tarzan. I couldn't help roll my eyes. In that moment, he encapsulated my Bali experience: A beautiful island where authenticity often feels sacrificed by an almost cultlike, spiritual aesthetic.\n\nTo criticize any part of Thailand feels like a betrayal. In fact, I adore the country so much that I moved there last year. Over the years, I've explored the alleys of Bangkok and island-hopped between the country's stunning southern islands like Phuket and Koh Samui. So naturally, the cultured, serene north of Chiang Mai was next on my list.\n\nHowever, I was left completely underwhelmed when I finally visited in 2023. Chiang Mai is undeniably pleasant. It's serene. It's famous for its stunning temples. But after you've visited the fifth or sixth wat, you quickly realize there isn't much else to do.\n\nMy memory is of a dusty, charming town, one sleepy river, and a bunch of temples. In a kingdom bursting with energetic cities and idyllic islands, Chiang Mai is Thailand's sleepiest, if not downright dull, destination.",

Last month, the agency's CEO and founder, Casey Wasserman, appeared in a trove of Department of Justice documents related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\"I hold my teams to the highest standards and have a duty to protect them as well,\" Roan wrote. \"No artist, agent, or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\"\n\nThe \"Good Luck, Babe!\" singer said she respected and appreciated staff at the agency but that the decision reflected her \"belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust.\"\n\nRoan did not explicitly mention Epstein in her post, but it comes after The Wrap and The Hollywood Reporter reported about turmoil inside the agency over the CEO's appearance in the files.\n\nRepresentatives for Wasserman Music did not respond to a request for comment. The CEO has previously said he regrets the association.\n\nWasserman appeared in the most recent tranche of Epstein-related documents released by the DOJ. Appearing in the files does not necessarily suggest that a person has engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nThe documents included flirtatious email exchanges between Wasserman and Ghislaine Maxwell from 2003.\n\nMaxwell was convicted in December 2021 of five counts related to a sex trafficking scheme involving minors with Epstein. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022.\n\nWasserman, who is also the chairman of LA28, the organizing committee for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, apologized in a statement on January 31.\n\n\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell, which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" he said. \"I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"\n\nRoan, whose name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, has been repped by the talent agency Wasserman since 2023. She is the latest star to leave the agency amidst the Epstein fallout. The artists Beach Bunny, Wednesday, and Bethany Cosentino from Best Coast walked away from the agency in the past week. In 2024, Billie Eilish left the agency for other reasons.",

The post on Monday appeared to be a nod to the tortoise-and-hare fable, framing Blue Origin as the slow-and-steady contender and SpaceX as the faster but more distracted rival.\n\nMusk and Bezos have been rivals for years, frequently clashing over their space ambitions at SpaceX and Blue Origin, as well as over their fortunes.\n\nAfter long touting Mars as SpaceX's main destination, Musk said on Sunday that the company has shifted its focus to the moon.\n\n\"For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,\" he wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the moon is faster,\" he added.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that SpaceX told investors it is targeting March 2027 for an uncrewed landing on the moon.\n\nIn a separate post on X, Musk said on Sunday that SpaceX would \"continue to launch directly from Earth to Mars while possible, rather than moon to Mars.\"\n\n\"Fuel is relatively scarce on the moon,\" Musk added.\n\nMusk previously said SpaceX would send an uncrewed mission to Mars by the end of 2026.\n\n\"No, we're going straight to Mars. The moon is a distraction,\" he said in January last year in response to a post on X.\n\nMusk is known for rolling out bold timelines for projects such as electric vehicles — only to revise or abandon them later.\n\nBezos has long emphasised the moon as humanity's next destination, and has taken aim at Musk's push to colonize Mars.\n\n\"Go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first and see if you like it, because it's a garden paradise compared to Mars,\" Bezos said in 2019.\n\nDuring a presentation for project Blue Moon, Bezos included a slide about Mars with the title \"FAR, FAR AWAY,\" referencing SpaceX's Mars ambition.\n\nBlue Origin said previously it aimed to reach the moon by 2023 — a target it did not meet.",

    "description": "Instead of building toward the regular season in spring training, players in the WBC will step right into a playoff atmosphere. \"It can derail some pitchers.\"",
    "fullText": "Come early March, a small, but mighty group of San Francisco Giants will disperse from camp in Scottsdale, Ariz., suit up in their home country's colors and gear up for the triennial World Baseball Classic.\n\nThe WBC is a two-week tournament played in Puerto Rico, Japan, Houston and Miami and jam-packed with playoff intensity. The 2023 tournament left viewers on a high when Shohei Ohtani struck out Team USA's Mike Trout swinging at a nasty breaking ball to seal Team Japan's title.\n\nThree years ago, former Giants Camilo Doval and Joc Pederson competed. This year, eight Giants big leaguers will participate as well as three coaches, two press officers, one minor league infielder, one minor league hitting coach and, perhaps most notably, one athletic trainer. They will represent 13 countries: USA, Great Britain, Puerto Rico, South Korea, Venezuela, Colombia, Israel, Italy, Brazil, Australia, Netherlands, Mexico and Nicaragua.\n\nSeveral Giants wll play leading roles for their teams, including Logan Webb for Team USA, Jung Hoo Lee for South Korea and Heliot Ramos for Puerto Rico. There are variables that come into play for the big leaguers participating as the Giants ramp up for the 2026 season with an entirely new coaching staff, hoping to push off from the .500 record that's entrapped them for the better part of this decade.\n\nThat Dave Groeschner - the Giants' longtime head athletic trainer, will lend his services to Team USA - alongside Webb comes as a huge relief to the Giants front office.\n\nGroeschner will be able to closely monitor Webb's condition and report back to the team's head honchos about their ace as the tournament progresses. The most important variable for all teams, including the Giants, will be to keep in touch with their players' progress for those two-ish weeks they'll be outside their purview. But Webb is of extra concern given his status at the top of the rotation and his workload over the last few seasons.\n\nPresident of baseball operations Buster Posey expressed clear concern about risks associated with the WBC, particularly with starting pitchers in their prime. Posey, who played in the 2017 WBC, said at the winter meetings that it's a \"great event,\" but thought it was better fit for pitchers in the later stage of their careers.\n\nClayton Kershaw, who retired after the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series title this fall, will pitch for the USA this March, for example. The decision to participate lies with the player, though, and Webb wants to play after having opted out in 2023.\n\nThere's high hopes for Team USA to make the semifinal round in Miami, which means Webb would get the full WBC experience. That means his ramp up, one he's had down to a science ready to be Opening Day starter four consecutive seasons, will have to be slightly modified.\n\nIn practice, that means the Giants will be in communications with USA manager Mark DeRosa - a member of San Francisco's 2010 World Series-winning team - about Webb's usage. Strict workload rules are already in place: In the pool round (Team USA will be in Houston for this round), no pitcher can throw more than 65 pitches in an outing. If Team USA makes the quarterfinals, which begin March 13, that number goes up to 80. And for the semifinals and championship, spanning March 15-17, the pitch count ticks up to 95.\n\nThe limitations generally comply with how a starting pitcher's ramp-up looks in spring, and tournament officials send data to MLB teams from their players' outings. But the Giants are most concerned about the atmosphere, how the high leverage, adrenaline-filled games might alter a month in which players are typically dedicated to pace and caution.\n\n\"We've also seen over the years that it can derail some pitchers, because there's no way to replicate getting yourself ready for, essentially, a playoff baseball atmosphere in early March,\" Posey said in December at the Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla.\n\nIn 2023, the New York Mets lost closer Edwin Diaz for the season when he tore his patellar tendon in a Puerto Rico victory celebration gone awry. Posey might also be thinking about Ryan Vogelsong, who pitched for the USA in 2013 and had a rocky start to his season weeks later - a 7.19 ERA in his first nine starts.\n\nThose scenarios are a bit less of a concern for non-starters, who may not be pitching in such high-leverage spots. More of a concern for the rest - Ramos, Lee, Tristan Beck, Luis Arráez, Reiver Sanmartin, Jose Butto, Harrrison Bader - will be the gap in acclimating with almost an entirely new coaching staff.\n\nAll the Giants' WBC players will be reporting back to rookie manager Tony Vitello and his new-look staff. Ramos, Lee, Bader and Arráez will report to hitting coaches Hunter Mense and Oscar Bernard about how their batting practices feel. Webb, Butto, Beck and Sanmartin will have more involved talks with new pitching coaches Justin Meccage, Frank Anderson, Jesse Chavez and Christian Wonders to update on their bullpen sessions.\n\nSpring training isn't the only runway for players to get to know their coaches. Many have been collaborating in Arizona all winter, well before Tuesday's pitchers and catchers reporting date (the coaches have been in their roles for months despite the official hiring announcement not coming out until last Friday).\n\nThis article originally published at Giants' Buster Posey casts a wary eye on adrenaline generated in WBC.",

    "fullText": "The highly anticipated men’s ice hockey tournament will kick off on Wednesday, but ahead of that, the women’s competition has already delivered some memorable moments, including standout performances from a pair of local Manitoban defenders representing Team Canada.\n\nWinnipeg native Kati Tabin and Ste. Anne’s Jocelyne Larocque have both played meaningful roles on Canada’s blue line, helping the defending champions open the tournament with two dominant victories. Canada began round-robin play with a convincing 4-0 shutout of Switzerland before following it up with a 5-1 win over Czechia on Monday.\n\nTabin has been used in more of a depth role through the opening games but has continued to make the most of her opportunities. In the tournament opener against Switzerland, she logged 9:53 of ice time and recorded two shots on goal. Her role expanded in the second game, as she saw her minutes climb to 13:42 against Czechia, though she was held without a shot.\n\nLarocque, meanwhile, has taken on a heavier workload and has been a steady presence on the back end. The veteran defenseman played 21:12 in Canada’s opening win, finishing the game with two shots on net while helping anchor the defensive effort. In the second game, her ice time dipped slightly to 17:17 as Tabin’s role increased, but Larocque remained an important part of Canada’s defensive rotation.\n\nANOTHER WIN IN THE BOOKS 🇨🇦\n\nTeam Canada improves to 2-0 following their win over Czechia at #MilanoCortina2026 👏 pic.twitter.com/QwHXUZLvZH\n\n— Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) February 9, 2026\n\nWith two wins already secured, Canada now turns its attention to the final game of the round robin, a highly anticipated matchup against its long-time rival, the United States. The Canadians and Americans will meet Tuesday afternoon at 1:10 p.m. EST, with the game airing on CBC, Sportsnet, and TSN.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Keion White was shot in the ankle during an event on Monday morning.\n\nWhite was shot at 4:06 a.m. on the 17th block of Mission Street in San Francisco, a San Francisco Police spokesman said, via The Athletic. There was an altercation between two groups that broke out at an event there that led to the shooting, though specifics of that incident are not yet known. White is not believed to have been part of that altercation, though he was shot in the ankle.\n\nHe was taken by police to a nearby hospital, and is expected to be OK.\n\n“Keion White was a victim of a shooting and sustained a bullet wound to his ankle this morning in San Francisco,\" the 49ers said in a statement. \"He is currently undergoing surgery at a local hospital. We will provide further updates when appropriate.”\n\nThe incident took place hours after the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium on the other side of the Bay Area. The stadium sits more than 40 miles away in Santa Clara, south of San Francisco. White was at the Super Bowl, and was spotted wearing a Patriots hat.\n\nWhite was traded to the 49ers in October from the Patriots, who selected him with the No. 46 overall pick in 2023. White had 18 total tackles and 1.5 sacks in 14 games this season. The 27-year-old has one year left on his initial four-year, $7.7 million deal. The 49ers went 12-5 this past season and reached the playoffs, though they were knocked out in the divisional round.\n\nWhite is now the second 49ers player to be shot in recent years. Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall was shot in the chest during an attempted robbery in San Francisco ahead of his rookie season in 2024. Pearsall ended up returning to play in 11 games during that season.",

The elder Kubiak won Super Bowl 50 as coach of the Broncos.\n\nOn the field after the 29-13 win over the Patriots, Kubiak made it clear that he'd be taking the job. Which means he'd been offered the job at some point before the game. Which also means the Raiders had run afoul of the tampering policy by doing more than simply interviewing Kubiak.\n\nIt's unlikely the league will do anything about it, unless the Seahawks file a complaint. Given that they won the Super Bowl and fully expected Kubiak to go, it's unlikely they'll make an issue out of it.\n\nThe league could, if it wanted. But the tampering policy is enforced sporadically and unpredictably. Look for this to become just another example of a team disregarded the terms of the tampering policy, without consequence.\n\nIt's a far from ideal way to do business, but that's how NFL business is usually done.",

    "description": "Five standout athletes, including Jacob Arter and Anna Hartig, were inducted into the Lancaster High School Gary Mauller Athletic Wall of Honor.",
    "fullText": "LANCASTER — It was a night of celebration on Feb. 6 as five new members were inducted into the Lancaster High School Gary Mauller Athletic Wall of Honor.\n\nThe induction ceremony occurred before the boys' varsity basketball game against Reynoldsburg at Lancaster High School.\n\nThe Wall of Honor is named after Gary Mauller, an educator in the Lancaster City Schools for 47 years, serving as athletic director from 1989 to 1996. He always believed it was important to honor tradition and recognize outstanding efforts by Lancaster athletes.\n\nMauller began hanging pictures on the hallway wall during his tenure as athletic director. Upon Mauller’s passing in April of 2017, donations in his memory have enabled the continuation of his mission to recognize Lancaster High School’s athletic tradition.\n\nMore: What a remarkable ride: My journey from the MV News mail room to the OPSMA Hall of Fame\n\nJacob Arter (Class of 2017): A three-year varsity starter, second-team OCC in 2015 and 2016, and first-team OCC in 2017. He is second all-time on the boys’ basketball career points list with 1,171, third all-time career field goals made with 411, and sixth all-time for individual points scored in a single game with 38. In track and field, he was the OCC and regional high jump champion, qualifying for the state track and field championships as a senior. His 6-foot-7 jump is currently fourth best in Lancaster High School history. Arter was a walk-on at Ohio State University on the track and field team.\n\nDoug Conroy (Class of 1985): He was the Central Ohio League cross country individual champion his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons. Placed third in the state cross country meet in his senior year. He was the track and field Central Ohio League champion in the 800 and 1,600 during his sophomore, junior, and senior years. District champion in the 800, sophomore, junior, and senior, and district champion in the 1,600 as a sophomore. He was the regional champion in the 800 and 4x800 relay junior and senior years. District and regional in the 4x400 relay junior and senior, and second in his junior year and third in his senior year in the state championships in the 800. He received All-American distinction and was the Golden West Invitational 800 champion.\n\nAnna Hartig (Class of 2019): She earned 12 varsity letters during her high school career, excelling at soccer, basketball, and track and field. She scored 1,079 career points in basketball, where she was first team All-OCC in 2017, 2018, and 2019, first team all-district in 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019, and was an OCC Scholar Athlete award winner in 2019. In track and field, she was All-Ohio in 2017, as well as Academic All-Ohio, second team OCC in 2019, and third team OCC in 2018. Hartig graduated Cum Laude from Ohio State University in 2022 and will receive her Doctorate from the New England College of Optometry in 2027.\n\nKyle Mackie (Class of 1997): A 2011 Ohio Dominican University Athletic Hall of Fame inductee for his accomplishments on the baseball field. In 1998, he was second team All-Mid-Ohio Conference and first team in 1999, 2000, and 2001. He was an NAIA Academic All-American in 2000 and 2001.

    "fullText": "CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy — Lindsey Vonn sustained a “complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly” after her devastating crash in the Olympic downhill, the skier said in a social media post late Monday.\n\nVonn posted on Instagram about her left leg injuries following her fall in Sunday’s race.\n\n“While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets,” Vonn said.\n\nNine days before Sunday’s crash, the 41-year-old Vonn ruptured the ACL in her left knee. It is an injury that sidelines pro athletes for months, but ski racers have on occasion competed that way. She appeared stable in two downhill training runs at the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nOnlookers on social media wondered if Vonn’s ruptured ACL could have played a factor in her crash near the top of the Olympia delle Tofana course, where she has a World Cup record 12 wins. That maybe, on a healthy left knee, she would not have clipped a gate and been able to stave off a crash.\n\n“Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would,” Vonn said. “It wasn’t a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\n\n“I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever.”\n\nVonn’s father said Monday that the American superstar will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision.\n\n“She’s 41 years old and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.”\n\nWhen she arrived in Cortina last week, Vonn said she had consulted with her team of physicians and trainers before deciding to move ahead with racing. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation does not check on the injury statuses of athletes.\n\n“I firmly believe that this has to be decided by the individual athlete,” FIS president Johan Eliasch said Monday in Bormio. “And in her case, she certainly knows her injuries on her body better than anybody else. And if you look around here today with all the athletes, the athletes yesterday, every single athlete has a small injury of some kind.\n\n“What is also important for people to understand, that the accident that she had yesterday, she was incredibly unlucky. It was a one in a 1,000,” Eliasch added. “She got too close to the gate, and she got stuck when she was in the air in the gate and started rotating. No one can recover from that, unless you do a 360. … This is something which is part of ski racing. It’s a dangerous sport.”\n\nThe Italian hospital in Treviso where Vonn was being treated said late Sunday she had undergone surgery to repair a broken left leg. The U.S. Ski Team has said only that Vonn “sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.”\n\nPierre Ducrey, the sports director for the International Olympic Committee, noted Vonn was able to train and had experts counseling her decision.",

    "fullText": "Klint Kubiak is officially the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, agreeing on a five-year contract, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.\n\nLeadership in place. #RaiderNation \n\n— Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Raiders and Kubiak struck an agreement on February 1, the morning after his second interview with the team. However, the Raiders had to wait until after Sunday’s Super Bowl in which Kubiak served his final game as the Seattle Seahawks’ offensive coordinator in a 29-13 winning effort. Kubiak confirmed after the game he was headed to Las Vegas.\n\nThe Raiders focused on Kubiak because he was a young offensive mind who has never been a head coach. The Raiders interviewed more than a dozen candidates, but Kubiak was their focus.\n\nKubiak, who turns 39 on February 17, was the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator 2025 and was wildly successful. Previously, he served in the same position with the New Orleans Saints and coached former Raiders quarterback Derek Carr in 2024 and with the Minnesota Vikings in 2021. He has 12 seasons experience as an NFL coach.\n\nKubiak is the son of Denver Broncos Super Bowl-winning head coach Gary Kubiak and the brother of San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak, who also interviewed with the Raiders.\n\nReportedly, Raiders’ part owner Tom Brady, who helped lead the search, was a big fan of Klint Kubiak and he called several of the Seahawks’ games this season for Fox.\n\nNow, Brady and the Raiders hope Kubiak can led the offense, and likely new quarterback Fernando Mendoza into a new, winning era.",

    "fullText": "The big story over the weekend at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi was Lindsey Vonn’s crash in the women’s downhill on Sunday. For Vonn, her Olympic experience in Milan was not supposed to end this way after an iconic career that saw her be one of the best female alpine skiing speed racers of all-time. The crash was simply spectacular, and the 41-year-old Olympic gold medalist from Saint Paul, Minnesota was heard screaming on the course as she was lifted by helicopter.\n\nWith the injury to Vonn, will many sports fans remember who won the Olympic gold medal in the women’s downhill? It just so happened to be another American in Breezy Johnson of Jackson, Wyoming.\n\nInside look at Johnson’s Olympic gold\n\nJohnson posted a winning time of 1:36.10. Emma Aicher of Germany won the silver medal with a time of 1:36.14. Sofia Goggia of Italy won the bronze medal with a time of 1:36.69. Johnson reached the podium by 0.86 seconds over Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon, and Cornelia Hutter of Austria, as they both had a fourth place time of 1:36.96.\n\nAt age 30, this is the first Olympic gold medal for Johnson in her impressive skiing career. She previously won two gold medals at the Alpine Skiing World Championships in Saalbach, Austria. Johnson won gold in the women’s downhill, and gold in the women’s team combined with another American icon in women’s alpine skiing, Mikaela Shiffrin of Vail, Colorado. Due to the fact that Johnson has been a big performance skier in the past, the Olympic gold medal in Cortina should not have been much of a surprise–even to Snoop Dogg, who was watching the women’s downhill with Lindsey’s father.\n\nUSA has two gold medals to date\n\nJohnson’s gold medal is one of two medals for the United States so far. They also placed first in the team figure skating competition. The Americans beat Italy by a single point. The Americans were led by quad and backflip artist Ilia Malinin in the men’s event, and ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates in ice dance.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympics: Did the Lindsey Vonn crash overshadow Breezy Johnson’s Olympic gold? appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Editor's Note: This article is published in partnership with Read The Line, a Golf Digest content partner.",
    "fullText": "For the third consecutive year, the historic Pebble Beach Golf Links has been awarded Signature Event status as a star-studded field descends upon this iconic venue. The opening two rounds will feature a Pro-Am format, with all players in the 80-man field paired alongside celebrities while rotating between Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill.\n\nThe Signature Event designation means there will be no cut, allowing all 80 players to advance to the weekend for the final two rounds at Pebble Beach. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler headlines the best field to date this year, also highlighted by the 2026 PGA Tour debut of defending Pebble Beach champion Rory McIlroy.\n\nLet’s dive into my top 10 contenders to watch as the best in the world take center stage at the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.\n\nOne of the keys to unlocking low scores at Pebble Beach is dominating the par 5s, as evidenced by Rory McIlroy’s two eagles last year that propelled him to victory. Enter Jake Knapp, the current leader in par-5 scoring average over his past 40 rounds.\n\nKnapp has become a familiar name on Sunday leader boards this season, posting three T-11-or-better finishes in all of his 2026 starts. He’s unbothered by the pesky Poa annua greens, ranking fourth in the field from inside 15 feet on Poa. Bomb it far and putt it well, Knapp will look to deploy the McIlroy game plan this week at Pebble.\n\nA shorter golf course, difficult-to-hit greens and excellent course history: Russell Henley checks every box at Pebble Beach. Nearly half of the approach shots come from inside 150 yards, playing directly into the strengths of the world’s No. 6-ranked player.\n\nHenley boasts a remarkably high floor, producing top-20 finishes in each of his past 10 PGA Tour starts. Pebble is an ideal fit for his game, and a course where he gained +7.5 strokes with the putter in 2025, his best putting performance of the past two years.\n\nCue the “home game” narrative. Maverick McNealy grew up with a home just off Pebble Beach and considers this his favorite tournament of the year. His course familiarity is second to none, but it’s his trending form that earns him a spot among my top contenders.\n\nMcNealy has gained strokes on the field in all four major statistical categories in each of his three starts in 2026. His consistently strong approach play and tendency to spike with the putter give him real upside for anyone looking deeper down the odds board.\n\nSince the summer of 2024, only Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have more PGA Tour wins than Chris Gotterup. His rapid ascent continued with his second victory of 2026, making birdie on six of his final seven holes to win the WM Phoenix Open in a playoff.\n\nHe’s built for the moment, relishing opportunities to take down the game’s titans and proving he has the clutch gene. His dominance off the tee alone can carry him to victory. The sky is the limit for Gotterup, and this rocket ship shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.\n\nA T-3 finish at the WM Phoenix Open once again left Si Woo Kim backers empty-handed after he shared the lead for much of Sunday in Scottsdale. Still, the world-class ball-striking continues, and it feels like only a matter of time before the putts finally fall when it matters most.\n\nEventually, this hourglass of elite form will run out. Until then, Kim led the field tee to green last week and continues to put himself in contention regardless of course style or location. One of the tour’s most aggressive players, his moment is coming during this run.\n\nPebble Beach is often won on the back of precise, demanding approach play into the smallest greens on the PGA Tour, and that points directly to Viktor Hovland. He attacked the treacherous pin locations at TPC Scottsdale, firing a 9-under weekend to vault himself into a top-10 finish.\n\nHardcore golf fans will remember the 2018 U.S. Amateur, held at Pebble Beach and won by a free-spirited, immensely talented young Norwegian named Viktor Hovland. He looks well-suited to add another victory on the Pacific cliffs and reestablish himself among the world’s elite.\n\nTwenty-six years after making his professional debut, Justin Rose sits No. 3 in the world at age 45. It’s truly amazing. Rose captured his 13th PGA Tour title two weeks ago at Torrey Pines, surpassing $75 million in career earnings along the way.\n\nIt’s been an extraordinary career, and Rose remains a legitimate threat any time he tees it up. At this stage, he chooses his spots carefully, and Pebble Beach is always circled. A winner here in 2023, he’s more than capable of adding another trophy this week.\n\nIt’s been just over five months since Tommy Fleetwood’s last PGA Tour start, arguably the feel-good moment of the season, when he finally shed the monkey off his back by winning the 2025 Tour Championship.\n\nHe followed that up with another victory on the DP World Tour in October and enters 2026 primed for a run toward the top. Fleetwood’s elite wedge play on a shorter-than-average course gives him a real chance to neutralize the game’s biggest hitters at the top.\n\nPebble Beach. The Players. The Masters. The Irish Open. The Ryder Cup. 2025 was a dream season, the best of Rory McIlroy’s career, and it all started here. McIlroy dismantled Pebble Beach, overpowering it with driver and taking unimaginable lines over doglegs en route to a comfortable two-shot victory.\n\nHe returns to defend his title, making his PGA Tour season debut after eight consecutive DP World Tour starts. Does he have enough in the tank for another heavyweight battle with Scheffler in 2026? Like most golf fans, I can’t wait to find out.\n\nIn the opening round of the WM Phoenix Open, Scottie Scheffler finally looked human. He spotted the leader 10 shots through 18 holes and still nearly won the tournament. We saw his worst, and only two players in the 123-man field managed to beat him in the end.\n\nIf that doesn’t illustrate the massive gap between Scheffler and the rest of the PGA Tour, nothing does. He’s a deserving, prohibitive favorite once again, continuing his reign as the best player walking the planet. Scottie Scheffler sits atop my power rankings, and it isn’t particularly close.\n\nJoe Idone is a Read The Line contributor and host of the Preferred Lines podcast.",

    "description": "Tracy Scroggins, who played 10 seasons with the Detroit Lions, died at age 56 after battling CTE, his family announced on Feb. 9.",
    "fullText": "Former Detroit Lions defender Tracy Scroggins has died at the age of 56, his family announced Feb. 9.\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Tracy Scroggins,\" his family said in a statement provided to TMZ.\n\n\"Tracy was a devoted father, cherished family member, and loyal friend whose life was marked by remarkable strength and perseverance. While many knew him for his career as a professional football player in the NFL, those closest to him knew him as a kind-hearted and generous man who cared deeply for his family and friends.\"\n\nThe family also revealed in its announcement of Scroggins death that the 56-year-old had suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) during his post-playing career.\n\n\"Playing in the NFL gave Tracy the opportunity to pursue his lifelong dream and to rise from poverty,\" the statement read. \"However, unfortunately, the NFL was also ultimately the cause of his untimely demise. Tracy spent every moment of retirement courageously battling the devastating effects of CTE. While our hearts are heavy, we find comfort in knowing that he is finally at peace.\"\n\nScroggins was one of nearly 5,000 players to file concussion-related lawsuits against the NFL before the league's sweeping concussion settlement in 2015.\n\nScroggins filed an additional claim against the NFL in 2016. His lawyer at the time – Tim Howard – stating his client was suffering from symptoms consistent with CTE, which can only be diagnosed with a postmortem brain examination.\n\n\"He can't remember where he is or where he's going,\" Howard told USA TODAY Sports in 2016. \"He hasn't been able to hold a job over the last six years. Beyond memory issues, he suffers from depression and has angry outbursts.\"\n\nScroggins played 10 NFL seasons, all for the Lions, after being selected in the second round of the 1992 NFL Draft. The Tulsa product played 142 games and made 89 starts while playing both defensive end and linebacker.\n\nScroggins racked up 60.5 career sacks – good for the seventh-most in franchise history – and was named the 90th-greatest player in franchise history by Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press – a member of the USA TODAY Network – in 2019.\n\nScroggins told The Detroit News in 2016 that he \"doesn't have any regrets\" about his career – with one caveat.\n\n\"I think things happen, sometimes for a reason,\" Scroggins said. \"But if I had the knowledge that players today have, I think that probably my career would’ve been five years shorter than it was.\"\n\nThe Lions paid homage to Scroggins with a social media post shortly after his death was announced:\n\nWe join the NFL community in mourning the loss of Lions Legend Tracy Scroggins, who played his entire 10-year in Detroit (1992-2001). pic.twitter.com/TdLRRXAWhn\n\n— Detroit Lions (@Lions) February 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Former Detroit Lions star dies after battling CTE, family announces",

    "fullText": "Most seem to agree that the St. Louis Cardinals have had a very active and successful offseason, but how likely is it that they still might trade JoJo Romero? There are many questions including if, to who and when.\n\nAs of today, the St. Louis Cardinals are only days away from pitchers and catchers reporting to Spring Training in Jupiter, Florida. There are still rumblings that the trade winds haven’t stopped blowing yet as JoJo Romero is reportedly still being discussed with other teams. While I can’t confirm that anything is close, a trade of JoJo is still possible. The most recent reporting I can find about Romero’s status came from MLB Trade Rumors just a few days ago on February 6. They asked their audience if they believe the St. Louis Cardinals will complete another trade before opening day and nearly 66% said yes.\n\nThe teams that reportedly have expressed the most interest in JoJo Romero are the New York Yankees, the Seattle Mariners and the Baltimore Orioles also according to MLB Trade Rumors. I’ve also seen mock trades suggested from the Toronto Blue Jays, but cannot confirm if that interest is serious. I thought there was a chance we’d see JoJo moved along with Brendan Donovan when his trade to the Seattle Mariners happened, but the fact that it didn’t makes me think that Chaim Bloom may have a different timeline in mind for JoJo.\n\nI’m wondering now if the St. Louis Cardinals are going to try and position JoJo Romero as a closer and then move him at the trade deadline when that market might be hot. That’s a gamble, but it might be the frame of mind that Chaim Bloom and his team have now that the ramp up to the season gets closer. I am reminded of an interview that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch had with JoJo late last season about what he learned from former Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley. Could it be that the Cardinals will set up closer by committee with JoJo and Riley O’Brien sharing that role?\n\nDo you think that the St. Louis Cardinals will trade JoJo Romero? If the answer is yes, do you think it should happen before Opening Day or at the trade deadline? If no, why are you in favor of holding onto him? I think we’ll find out sooner rather than later of what the St. Louis Cardinals are thinking about the future of JoJo Romero whether he’s a prime trade opportunity now or a bigger trade chip as a closer near the deadline this summer.",

    "description": "Mbappé vs. the Officials, Abuse in the Stands, and a Young Back Line That Held Firm",
    "fullText": "Real Madrid trips to Mestalla are rarely straightforward, and while the 2–0 scoreline suggests control, plenty of drama unfolded away from the goals. From sideline tension involving Kylian Mbappé to ugly scenes in the stands and a remarkably youthful defensive performance, here are a few moments from Sunday night that flew under the radar.\n\nKylian Mbappé was visibly frustrated with the officiating, particularly over an offside decision late in the first half. According to footage broadcast by DAZN, the French forward confronted the fourth official as players were heading down the tunnel at halftime, demanding clarification.\n\nMbappé questioned how the play could possibly be offside and asked for an explanation. The official responded by saying the call was determined by the broadcast camera angle and suggested discussing it inside the stadium. Mbappé agreed, insisting he wanted clarity because the decision made no sense to him.\n\nHowever, the explanation never came. As players prepared to return for the second half, Mbappé once again approached the fourth official, clearly irritated that he had been brushed off. He complained that he had been asked to speak inside, only to be ignored entirely. Realizing the conversation was going nowhere, Mbappé turned to Eduardo Camavinga nearby and muttered his verdict on the refereeing crew, calling them “clowns.”\n\nMbappé: “How is that offside? I’m asking about my position.”\n\nRef: “Sorry, we’ll talk inside.”\n\nMbappé: “I don’t understand.”\n\nRef: “Come inside.”\n\nMbappé: “I’m inside, so why won’t you talk to me?”pic.twitter.com/BQlEYYbSuX\n\n— 10 (@Kylian) February 8, 2026\n\nAs has become increasingly common in recent visits to Mestalla, the tension wasn’t limited to the pitch. Movistar cameras captured an unsettling incident involving a Real Madrid supporter seated among Valencia fans during the second half.\n\nThe fan, wearing a Madrid scarf, was confronted by several local supporters. During the altercation, his scarf was taken from him and tossed into the air. When he climbed down to retrieve it, another Valencia fan aggressively snatched it away again, while others nearby appeared to scold the aggressor.\n\nThe situation escalated as the Madrid supporter was escorted away by police. From above, another individual leaned over the railing, attempted to strike him, and ultimately spat in his direction — all clearly visible on the broadcast.\n\nThis was not the only disturbing moment involving the crowd. Later in the match, when referee Alberola Rojas paused play so a spectator could receive medical attention, sections of the Mestalla crowd broke into chants of “Mbappé, son of a bitch,” further highlighting the toxic atmosphere.\n\nMbappé would have the final word on the night, though. On his first visit to Mestalla, after being kept quiet for much of the game, he sealed Madrid’s win with a late goal in stoppage time.\n\nLost amid the noise and controversy was one of the most impressive aspects of Madrid’s performance: a defense built almost entirely on youth.\n\nWith injuries piling up and several senior defenders unavailable or not fully fit, Raúl González Blanco and Álvaro Arbeloa (via squad circumstances) were forced into fielding an extraordinarily young back four. David Jiménez (21), Raúl Asensio (22), Dean Huijsen (20), and Álvaro Carreras (22) started together, giving the defense an average age of just over 21 years. All were Spanish, and all but Huijsen came through the club’s academy system.\n\nIt was a lineup more reminiscent of Castilla than a La Liga clash at Mestalla. With no Rüdiger, Alaba, Carvajal, Mendy, Militão, or Fran García available, Madrid’s defensive average age dipped below 22 — a staggering number for a league match of this magnitude.\n\nJimenez, Asencio, Huijsen, Carreras. Was this the youngest backline fielded by a team in La Liga this season? It has to be up there, if not the youngest based on average age.\n\n— Managing Madrid (@managingmadrid) February 10, 2026\n\nAnd yet, the young back line barely put a foot wrong. Valencia were largely kept at arm’s length, Thibaut Courtois enjoyed one of his quietest nights in recent memory, and Madrid walked away with a clean sheet from one of the league’s most hostile venues.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the result was impressive. Given the age of the players tasked with seeing it through, it was even more so.",

    "description": "We ask Dolphins fans what they took from the Seahawks victory in the Super Bowl that the Phins should apply to the team.",
    "fullText": "So another NFL season has come and gone, ending last evening with the Super Bowl, which was won by the Seattle Seahawks. Seattle won the old school way, or the way I would prefer our very own Miami Dolphins to play. A stifling defense based on a solid pass rush and a solid secondary, and an offense with one of the better or best offensive lines and a back or two who can run it down your throat even when the opponent knows that you are going to run it down their throats.\n\nThe NFL is, if nothing else, a copycat league. There is more than one organization that saw the beatdown that the New England Patriots took last night and decided that they needed to do more of that, whichever part of the above they wanted to embrace and emulate. The run game didn’t destroy the Patriots, but it was enough to keep the offense moving, even if it ended in field goals more often than not.\n\nSam Darnold did make some plays, and some of those were very lucky not be picked, but after a while, you could tell that Seattle could feel it on defense and went into more of a play-it-safe mode overall. On the other side of the coin, Drake Maye was pestered all night, making him look more like the second-year player he is than the MVP runner-up that he also is. Maye had two touchdowns to Darnold’s one, but he also took seven sacks and threw two costly interceptions. Darnold threw no interceptions and took only one sack.\n\nAs a side note, the one highlight for the Patriots was Christian Gonzalez, who was the one player that seemed to keep the Pats somewhat in the game for more than a half. So now we have the dumb luck of facing that dude for the next several years twice a year.\n\nSo tonights Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nWhat did you, as a Miami Dolphins fan, see from last evening’s game and victory by the Seahawks that you hope the new front office and coaching staff employ in their own plan to rebuild this team to something that looks respectable? On the other side of things, what did you see Seattle do that you hope the Dolphins do not grasp onto in their own rebuild?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nGuerschon Yabusele never got on the same page with New York Knicks head coach Mike Brown.\n\nAs a result, Yabusele was traded at the deadline to the Chicago Bulls and has found success with a change of scenery.\n\nThat said, Yabusele had to amend his contract in order to facilitate the trade to Chicago.\n\nIn order to be moved, Yabusele voided the second-year of his two-year contract, worth $6 million.\n\nYabusele opened up recently about his decision to void the guaranteed money, expressing his love for the game as the biggest reason why.\n\n“We can always see the side of the money and talk about it, but at the end of the day the passion is more than just the money. It’s being out there, missing the feeling of being out there, offense, defense. Just competing at a high level because I’m a competitor first,” Yabusele said.\n\nThis is just another chapter in what has been an interesting career for the Frenchman. Yabusele was drafted by the Celtics in 2016 and spent two seasons with them before finding his way out of the NBA. He spent five seasons overseas before returning to the NBA last year, posting a breakout season with the Philadelphia 76ers that earned him his most recent Knicks' contract.\n\nSince being acquired, Yabusele has averaged nearly 30 minutes per game in two appearances with the Bulls and is in the starting lineup for Monday's game against the Nets.\n\nYabusele has already posted one double-double and is averaging 12.5 points with Chicago. He's also been impressive defensively, racking up two blocks and three steals in his first two appearances.\n\nThese numbers are much more efficient from his time in New York, where he averaged 2.7 points and 2.1 rebounds in 8.9 minutes per game.\n\nGiven his story, it'll be quite interesting to see if Yabusele's second half in Chicago is enough to earn him a contract for next season.\n\nCoby White feels 'wanted' by Charlotte after trade to Hornets\n\nTravis Scott screams after James Harden's Cavaliers debut\n\nNic Claxton reveals thoughts following Cam Thomas' release\n\nJJ Redick reveals thoughts on Luke Kennard-Gabe Vincent trade\n\nGuerschon Yabusele's Bulls performance proves Mike Brown didn't use him properly\n\nHornets make 26-year franchise history in win vs. Rockets",

Kubiak arrived in Las Vegas on Monday fresh off a 29-13 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday.  If Kubiak brings coaches with him from Seattle, he could consider quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko for offensive coordinator and Aden Durde on the defensive side.",
    "fullText": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The Las Vegas Raiders made it official Monday by announcing Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak will be their next head coach.\n\nKubiak arrived in Las Vegas on Monday fresh off a 29-13 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday.\n\nAmong the questions facing Kubiak, who will be formally introduced Tuesday, as he takes over:\n\n— Who he will hire as his coordinators on offense and defense?\n\nIf Kubiak brings coaches with him from Seattle, he could consider quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko for offensive coordinator and Aden Durde on the defensive side. It obviously would be a promotion for Janocko, though Kubiak might call the plays. Durde is the Seahawks' DC, but he would have the opportunity to have full control of the defense, unlike in Seattle where coach Mike Macdonald calls plays on that side of the ball.\n\n— What to do about defensive end Maxx Crosby?\n\nTwo NFL reporters have said that the Raiders' star pass rusher wants out. He wasn't happy about being placed on injured reserve with two games left this past season and might not have the appetite for another rebuild attempt. Crosby said on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that no such talk came from him, but he also didn't deny he wanted out.\n\nThe Raiders could get a haul by trading the 28-year-old Crosby and perhaps even accelerate the rebuild. Dallas got two first-rounders and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark by shipping Micah Parsons to Green Bay.\n\n— How will he prepare for free agency and the draft?\n\nLas Vegas has the No. 1 pick and more than $91 million in salary cap space, according to overthecap.com, so the Raiders have the opportunity to greatly upgrade their roster. It's almost certain they will use that top pick on Fernando Mendoza, who won the Heisman Trophy and quarterbacked Indiana to the national championship.\n\nBut the Raiders will need to surround Mendoza with a lot more talent than is currently on the roster. Their top priorities likely will be improving the offensive line and finding a No. 1 wide receiver. The defense doesn't have a glaring weakness, but can use help throughout that side of the ball.\n\nKubiak, 38, confirmed during an on-field interview with NFL Network after the Seahawks won the Super Bowl on Sunday that he was heading to Las Vegas. Not that it was a surprise.\n\nKubiak and the Raiders began working toward finalizing an agreement more than a week ago for him to take the job, a person with knowledge of the discussions said at the time. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no contract was in place and no announcement could be made until after the Super Bowl in Santa Clara, California.\n\nHe'll be the third coach in three seasons for the Raiders and fifth full-time leader since they moved to Las Vegas in 2020. He succeeds Pete Carroll, who went 3-14 in one season in Las Vegas after a storied run with Seattle that included two Super Bowl appearances and one championship.\n\nThe Raiders have been searching for a path back to their glory days. Three Lombardi Trophies sit in the team’s facility, but the Raiders haven’t won a playoff game since their last Super Bowl appearance in the 2002 season. They have made the postseason just twice since, most recently in the 2021 season.\n\nKubiak oversaw a Seahawks offense that went from being ranked 18th the year before in scoring to third in the NFL this season and from 14th to eighth in yardage.\n\nHis work with quarterback Sam Darnold was particularly notable. Darnold completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions this season. Drafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold had been considered a bust until leading Minnesota to a 14-win season in 2024. But the Vikings moved on from Darnold, and he proved that season was no fluke, winning 14 games in the regular season with Seattle and three \n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "title": "Time is running out to get a WNBA deal done",
    "description": "The WNBA season is scheduled to start in three months, but there is still no contract between players and the league.",
    "fullText": "After meeting face-to-face a week ago, it seems the WNBA and the players are back to negotiating. It was reported that after the players submitted a CBA proposal to the league in December, the WNBA still hadn’t responded to it in February. The sides met in person in New York last week, with over 40 players attending in person or over Zoom. At that meeting, the league still did not have a response ready for them, but submitted their latest proposal later in the week, on Friday.\n\nWhile the league did not budge much on the matters of money — particularly on revenue sharing models — they have appeared to concede a few things to the players. After wanting to take away housing benefits in the league completely, this newest proposal from the league now has housing covered for players with under three years of WNBA service. Players will be entitled to a one-bedroom apartment for the first three years of their WNBA careers, with new developmental players being offered a studio apartment.\n\nBreanna Stewart told Jack Maloney of CBS Sports at Unrivaled this week that the WNBA conceding on a few of those smaller points was important, and that it “means that the league heard us on things that matter to us,” she said.\n\nYet, this proposal ultimately will not be accepted by the players, mostly because the league still isn’t offering enough when it comes to revenue-sharing percentage. According to Maloney’s report, there is still a huge gap between the sides on this topic — the players want 30% of gross revenue to be given back to them, resulting in a team salary cap aboove $10 million per year and a max individual player salary of about $2.5 million. The WNBA is still only offering about half of that.\n\nTime continues to tick on the clock to get a deal done, though. The WNBA season is scheduled to start in exactly three months. Training camp usually starts about 2-3 weeks before that, with the WNBA Draft happening a week before camp kicks off. That’s a month right there. There are over 100 free agents who need to negotiate and sign new individual player contracts, setting the league up for an unprecedented free agency period in extremely limited time.\n\nPlus, with two new expansion teams in Toronto and Portland being added to the league this year, an expansion draft also still needs to happen. With no CBA in place, there are no rules on what the expansion draft will look like, and therefore, Toronto and Portland have been unable to fully prepare for that draft. Whenever a new CBA does get signed, existing WNBA teams will need to take time to prepare their protected player lists under whatever new rules are going to be in place, and then the expansion teams will need to receive those lists and prepare accordingly. It’s not something that can happen in just the span of a few days.\n\nAll of this to say, we are starting to cut it close. The players can feel it, as Stewart expressed in the interview with CBS. There is only so much time to negotiate before the start of the season will need to be pushed back. There isn’t a hard date being publicly discussed right now, but the overwhelming belief in my conversations with people around the league is that if something doesn’t happen before February is over, the start of the season could be affected.\n\nSo far, there is no serious talk about the players planning a strike. The union voted to authorize their executive committee to initiate a strike back in December, with 98% of the union voting yes. For now, though, it seems like both sides are at least making token efforts in the hope it doesn’t get to that point.",

    "fullText": "Manolo González rued his side’s poor defensive performance as Villarreal put four goals past Espanyol in a Monday night thrashing at the Estadio de la Cerámica.\n\nEspanyol have struggled for form since Christmas with Monday’s 4-1 loss extending their winless run to six games across all competitions, and González stressed that “we need to reset now.”\n\n“We’ve got to find our competitiveness again. We need to reset now; we need to go back to attacking without conceding.\n\nVillarreal took a two-goal lead into the break after an acrobatic finish from Georges Mikautadze and an own goal from Jose Salinas.\n\n“The first half shouldn’t have been a 2-0 scoreline, no way. In the second half, we tried to push forward, but they caught us on the transition and killed the game off.\n\n“Villarreal are a talented team, but the goals were avoidable,” the 47-year-old commented post-match.\n\n“They went to the limit and we didn’t. We didn’t finish our counterattacks and we couldn’t get ourselves ahead on the scoreboard, and then the third goal at the start of the second half complicated the match.\n\n“We have to look forward and get back to our best, giving everything on the pitch. We’ve got to take a step forward and turn this situation around.”\n\nThe next two fixtures aren’t likely to be kind to the Catalan side, who host an in-form Celta Vigo side on Saturday before making the trip to face third-placed Atlético Madrid a week later.",

    "fullText": "Suwon Bluewings begin another season in a division they still feel they do not belong in — but one that recent failures suggest they do. After two unsuccessful promotion attempts, the club has turned to Lee Jung-hyo to end the nightmare. Can he restore Suwon to their rightful place, or are the Bluewings becoming a K League 2 fixture?\n\n*Defeated 3-0 by Jeju SK on aggregate in the playoffs.\n\nThe consequences of Suwon’s failure to earn promotion back to K League 1 for a second straight season have been severe. Gone are the general manager, the entire backroom staff — including first-team manager Byun Seung-hwan — and a host of senior players, including Lee Ki-jae.\n\nLee Ki-jae during happier times.\n\nSuwon invested heavily in their squad last winter, recruiting players in virtually every position. However, a terrible start — four points from the first four games — immediately put the club on the back foot. They never recovered sufficiently.\n\nOne of the major weaknesses in the Suwon squad over recent seasons had been their attack. A lack of goals cost the Bluewings their K League 1 status in 2023 and contributed to their dismal sixth-place finish last year. Byun completely overhauled his attacking options, bringing in proven talent — and it worked. Stanislav Iljutcenko, Matheus Serafim, and Kim Ji-hyeon combined for 38 goals as Suwon finished the campaign with an eye-watering total of 76.\n\nUnfortunately, as one gaping hole was repaired, another emerged. The Bluewings were torn apart at the back, conceding 50 goals in 39 matches, and three more against Jeju in the playoffs. These numbers are unsustainable, and what is most frustrating is that over the course of the 39-match regular season, Suwon never rectified the issue. This was compounded by the fact that Suwon fell behind in 19 of their 42 total matches. Only three times did they recover to win. Teams do not earn promotion with such glaring deficiencies.\n\nThe 50-year-old is not a new signing for the club, but the acquisition of the former Gwangju manager is arguably the biggest decision Suwon have made in years. Lee arrives with a stellar reputation as one of the most forward-thinking Korean managers on the circuit.\n\nWill Reis be celebrating for Suwon this season?\n\nWhen Lee signed, the question immediately became: which former Gwangju players would he bring with him? If you conducted a snap poll of Suwon supporters, the name Isnairo Reis Silva Morais would rank highly. The 33-year-old forward scored 10 goals in 32 matches last season and has previously played — and dominated — K League 2.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old goalkeeper Kim Joon-hong joins on a season-long loan from MLS side DC United. Kim arrived in the United States as DC’s first-choice goalkeeper, starting the opening seven matches. Results did not go his way, with the former Jeonbuk youngster conceding 12 goals in three matches before being dropped. DC United were dreadful overall, winning just five matches and finishing with the worst record in the league. Kim will be looking to rebuild his form and confidence at Big Bird. The talent is unquestionably there.\n\nThe saddest aspect of Lee Ki-jae’s departure is not just that his final match ended in defeat, but that it concluded with a scandalous red card. It brought an end to a seven-year association with the Bluewings, during which he earned international caps. Last season, he scored three goals and provided seven assists as Suwon’s first-choice left back. Now, Lee plies his trade in Iran.\n\nPark Hyun-bin will add some much needed steel to Suwon's central midfield.\n\nOther players have arrived with a higher profile under the Lee Jung-hyo revolution, but none will fill such a glaring hole in the lineup as former Bucheon FC midfielder Park Hyun-bin. The combative 22-year-old is exactly what Suwon have lacked for several seasons: a tough, uncompromising, ball-winning central midfielder who finally adds steel to the engine room.\n\nReis and Fessin will supply goals, but Suwon were not short of them last year. What they have craved for some time is a shield protecting their surprisingly fragile defence. Park opted against promotion with Bucheon — where he would have been a guaranteed K League 1 starter — suggesting Suwon made a compelling offer to a potential future Korean international.\n\nIt may sound strange to say this, but 20-year-old right back Lee Geon-hee might not start the season as Suwon’s first-choice option. He fought off competition from experienced former Incheon United defender Jeong Dong-yoon to make 27 appearances in an unstable back line last season.\n\nLee did enough to earn call-ups to the Korea U23 side, and supporters likely felt he still had room to grow. The club’s signing of Gyeongnam FC right back Lee Jun-jae has added depth to the position. Lee Geon-hee was less culpable than most of his senior defensive partners for Suwon’s defensive failures and offered a genuine threat marauding down the right flank.\n\nIs Lee Jung-hyo the man to awaken the giant?\n\nSuwon Bluewings stand on the precipice of becoming a K League 2 staple. This season marks their third year in Korea’s second division — an unthinkable scenario when relegation struck in 2023.\n\nThey responded to the failure to secure an immediate return by investing heavily in an attack that had malfunctioned for years. It still wasn’t enough. Concerns that financial backing would be scaled back have, however, proved unfounded.\n\nSecuring Lee Jung-hyo on a five-year deal was the coup of the winter. The former Busan player came agonisingly close to delivering Gwangju their first major silverware in December and soon after guided the club to the ACL Elite quarter-finals. Now, he is preparing for trips to Paju Frontier and Ansan Greeners.\n\nSuwon have placed all their eggs in this — admittedly impressive — basket. Lee is the best manager in Korea. He has a strong squad and incredible support behind him. If he cannot deliver promotion, it is difficult to imagine who can.\n\nEverything fun about Suwon Samsung Bluewings happens off the pitch — unless you are a rival supporter. The club averaged 12,048 spectators in 2025, their highest figure in a decade. Big Bird is a stunning stadium, and attending a match there remains one of the best football experiences in Korea.\n\nThe Big Bird atmosphere is one of Korea's best.\n\nDespite recent disappointments, those attendance figures are unlikely to dip, largely due to the excitement surrounding Lee Jung-hyo’s arrival. If the former Gwangju manager can get a tune out of his band, this could be a fascinating season to watch unfold.",

    "fullText": "While the Houston Texans sat at home watching as the Seattle Seahawks bested the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, players from H-Town could at least watch former players try to win a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nLast season, the Texans traded a haul to the Buffalo Bills for Pro Bowl wideout Stefon Diggs. He only played in eight games before a torn ACL sent him to the injured reserve, but he seemed to be well respected among those in the locker room.\n\nWhile he impressed during the regular season as Drake Maye's No. 1 weapon, Diggs struggled to make an impact in the passing game during his first Super Bowl appearance, totaling three catches for 37 yards, including a 26-yard reception late in the fourth quarter to set up a Maye touchdown pass.\n\nOutside of Diggs, no other former Texans player offered much in a 29-13 finish. Here's how every former Houston player performed in the big game out west.\n\nOutside of a few starts during the regular season, Jones, who played with the Texans in the 2023, mostly served as a backup role in the playoffs and only saw action in two snaps in his first Super Bowl appearance.\n\nAkers, a surprise addition to the active roster in 2024 and even started for the Texans with Joe Mixon sidelined, was elevated from Seattle's practice squad for the NFC championship game and Super Bowl in place of the injured Zach Charbonnet. He didn’t record a carry but did get to see the field on special teams.\n\nSaubert, who briefly spent time on the Texans' roster in 2023, totaled four catches for Seattle during the regular season and didn’t see much action in the Super Bowl. He did see action on special teams, mostly kickoffs, field goals and PATs, which was key for kicker Jason Myers in the team's victory.\n\nAustin, a member of the Texans' 2023 practice squad, did see some action on both defense and special teams later in the game. He did not record a stat in his limited reps.\n\nGriffin barely spent a season with the Texans as a part-time starter in 2023, but he's bounced around the league since being drafted in 2017 by Seattle out of Central Florida. Signing back with the franchise this offseason, Griffin didn’t earn an elevation from the team's practice squad in the playoffs and watched from the sidelines as his franchise finally hoisted a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nIf this marks the end of his career, at least he can say he earned a ring.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: How did every former Texans player perform in Super Bowl LX?",

    "description": "Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum suffered an Achilles tendon tear May 12 during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Here's the latest update.",
    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics just made an announcement their fans have been eager to hear.\n\nThe franchise said star forward Jayson Tatum, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in May, was assigned to participate in portions of a G League practice Monday, Feb. 9. Following that session, the Celtics will recall Tatum, where he’ll continue his rehab with the team.\n\nThe Celtics said they would issue future updates when appropriate.\n\nTatum, 27, had suffered the injury during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Knicks, but has remained a steady presence around the team through its first 53 games of the season.\n\nThe announcement doesn’t necessarily mean Tatum will return to game action imminently, but it does carry significant implications.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Jayson Tatum’s recovery from his Achilles tendon rupture:\n\nDoes this mean Tatum will absolutely return at some point during the 2025-26 season? Not necessarily. Is it a positive sign? Yes, overwhelmingly so.\n\nAchilles tendon ruptures are complicated injuries that require calculated and arduous rehabs. That Tatum has progressed to the point of limited participation in practice signals that he has advanced to a certain level of competence.\n\nIn September, Tatum told USA TODAY Sports that he hadn’t fully ruled out a return to the court for the 2025-26 season, so this aggressive timeline indicates that Tatum and the Celtics may be considering a pathway toward a return.\n\nTo be sure: the practices will be controlled and the franchise will push Tatum only as far as he’s able. And even then, they will exercise prudence and will closely monitor how he responds to the sessions.\n\nBut, if Tatum is to return this season, he’d eventually need to return to practice and a return this soon should build optimism.\n\nStill, there will be plenty of work left to do for Tatum, and the most challenging part of his recovery will almost certainly be mental. After extended absences, players often feel the need to be tentative or cautious out of fear of reaggravating the injury. Tatum may face similar concerns, and he may even feel he’s lost some explosion or speed.\n\nBut even though Achilles ruptures used to be considered career-ending injuries, modern medicine has allowed plenty of players to return to full health and participation after suffering them.\n\nBoston has surpassed expectations and is 34-19, which is currently third in the East. If Tatum is cleared and able to return, he would instantly add a massive boost of scoring, playmaking and rebounding for the Celtics.\n\nIt would also make the Celtics a real threat to win the Eastern Conference\n\nLast season, Tatum averaged 26.8 points, 8.7 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jayson Tatum injury update: Latest on Celtics star",

    "fullText": "The national high school boys basketball 2025-26 season is entering postseason mode as many states begin the playoff portion of their campaign.\n\nThe latest set of Top 25 National high school boys basketball rankings is a new No. 1 in Sierra Canyon (Calif.) as they edge out SPIRE Academy (OH). What other programs should be are under consideration as among the top high school boys basketball squads in the land in our tenth set of rankings?\n\nNational high school boys basketball teams now eye the road to the state playoffs and mythical national championship as the 2025-26 season starts heading down that path into the February.\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory as of Feb. 9.\n\nSince losing to Bishop McNamara back on Dec. 6, the Sierra Canyon Trailblazers (22-1) have been on a roll, winning 16 straight games and are the hottest high school boys basketball team currently. Sierra Canyon is as good as they come in the country as they feature 5-Star+ Brandon McCoy at combo guard along with 2027 four-star small forward Maximo Adams (North Carolina commitment). After the Hoophall Classic, the Trailblazers returned back to the Golden State and defeated one of the state’s best teams in Harvard-Westlake, 55-47. Sierra Canyon’s most recent win was a 103-74 rout of Loyola last week as they collected win No. 22 on the season.\n\nEasily considered one of the best high school boys basketball teams in the country is SPIRE Academy (18-2), under the direction of the one of the best coaches in the country in Kevin Boyle, drops down from No. 1 for the first time in nearly a month. SPIRE Academy has one of the top rosters in the entire country as they feature the likes of four-star combo guard King Gibson and four-star small forward Alex Constanza (Georgetown commit). SPIRE Academy looks to bounce back after a loss to nationally ranked Montverde Academy (Fla.) and the next time they’ll likely get to do that is on Feb. 21 versus Long Island Lutheran (NY).\n\nDynamic Prep (13-1) are led by former NBA star forward Jermaine O’Neal and are one of the premier destinations for top prep boys basketball programs and top prospects. Last week Dynamic Prep took on nationally ranked Prolific Prep (Fla.), defeating The Crew, 78-66. The team features several of the country’s top players in 2027 four-star small forward Marcus Spears Jr. and 2026 four-star shooting guard Dakari Spear, who this past summer with Drive Nation on the EYBL Circuit, averaged 13.6 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game. Dynamic Prep have picked up impressive wins throughout the season with impressive victories against No. 7 Columbus, No. 10 Montverde Academy and a very good Zephyrhills Christian Academy team, respectively.\n\nPaul VI Catholic Panthers (22-2) gets out of the fifth spot and moves up a notch in our latest set of Top 25 rankings. This team has played well all season long behind the ultra-competitive play of 2026 five-star shooting guard Jordan Smith Jr. as they have won 23 games through 25 appearances. The Panthers have been very impressive as among the twenty wins are highlighted victories over teams like Archbishop Stepinac (N.Y.), Father Judge (Pa.) and Calvary Christian Academy (Fla.), respectively. Leading the way out of the backcourt for the Panthers is Smith Jr. and 2027 three-star combo guard Troy Tomlin. Lone losses of the season thus far for Paul VI Catholic came against Prolific Prep and Calvary Christian Academy.\n\nThe Indiana high school boys basketball season has seen the Fishers Tigers (20-0) look every bit of being the best team in the Hoosier State so far through 20 games. Wins have come over Ben Davis, Mt Vernon,  Noblesville, Terre Haute North Vigo and Tech thus far as Fishers starts to head into the tougher portion of their regular season schedule in the early going. The Tigers will be tested in the coming days and weeks in contests versus state-ranked Crown Point and Hamilton Southeastern. Leading the way for Fishers is that of combo guards Carsen Eloms (Wisconsin commit) and Gage Sturgill. Fishers will be tested in the coming days versus Penn and Westfield, respectively.\n\n6. Link Academy (MO) (16-2)\n7. Montverde Academy (Fla.) (15-4)\n8. Prolific Prep (Fla.) (23-4)\n9. Sunnyslope (Ariz.) (22-1) \n10. Compass Prep (Ariz.) (12-4)\n\n11. Wisconsin Lutheran (WI) (19-0) \n12. Calvary Christian Academy (Fla.) (17-1)\n13. Bella Vista College Preparatory School (Ariz.) (9-3) \n14. Wasatch Academy (UT) (15-3)\n15. Santa Margarita Catholic (Calif.)

(21-7)\n\n21. Harvard-Westlake (Calif.) (21-5) \n22. Notre Dame (Calif.) (19-6) \n23. Timpview (UT) (19-2)\n24. Columbus (Fla.) (19-6)\n25. Archbishop Riordan (Calif.)

    "title": "Is Fiorentina the worst late-game team in Serie A?",
    "description": "All the explanation in the world is worth less than a tenth of the solution, but we’re stuck with the former for now.",
    "fullText": "After coughing up a stoppage time equalizer to Torino on Saturday, Fiorentina’s emotional state is somewhere between crumbling and smoldering. It had looked as if the Viola were going to record their first comeback win of the Serie A season; they’ve conceded first in 13 of 24 league matches in this year, taking a total of 5 points from them. That’s left manager Paolo Vanoli and his squad facing what feels like their 15th consecutive inquest.\n\nI’m just as frustrated as everyone about Fiorentina’s inability to hang on in the dying minutes of a game, not least because this equalizer was so predictable that even I saw it coming. As I often do when I’m sad, I decided to suck as many of the emotions out of my head as possible and turned to the pure, cold realm of numbers, hoping to throttle my sadness with math like a healthy person does. Long story short, I made myself a little table.\n\nI started out wondering if Fiorentina’s conceded more late goals (final 10 minutes and stoppage time) of any team in Serie A this year, but I quickly realized how limited that approach was because it ignored everything else. I decided to include the number of goals teams had scored as well as conceded, as the net value felt more important.\n\nI also decided figure out the rate at which teams conceded late goals. Dividing a 90 minute game into 6 10-minute periods made the most sense. You’d expect teams to concede about 16.67% of their goals in each 10-minute period. Anyways, I grabbed my data and went to my trusty visualizing website. The table’s sortable by any column if you want to play around with it.\n\nMuch to my astonishment, I discovered that Fiorentina isn’t the worst team in Serie A at the end of games by any measure. Hellas Verona and Pisa have both conceded 10 goals in the final 10 minutes, while Fiorentina sits at “just” 9. The percentage of total goals conceded late pulled me up short: the Viola are only 5th-worst, with Verona and Pisa below them, as well as high-flying Roma and Inter Milan? What? That’s wacky.\n\nThe attacking numbers were equally anemic for Vanoli’s boys: just 3 goals scored in the last 10 minutes of games, comprising 11.11% of the total goals conceded. In a truly bizarre statistical quirk, that’s the same as Sassuolo and Udinese while also being considerably higher than both Verona and Roma. Inter, by the way, is blowing everyone else away in late goals, turning this apparent weakness into a strength. In short, the Mastini are for sure the worst late-game team in Serie A, with Fiorentina, Pisa, and Roma jostling for the other two spots on the podium.\n\nOkay, so we’ve determined that Fiorentina isn’t Serie A’s worst late-game team. Let the joy be unconfined, et cetera. The performance in crunch time, though, is obviously a concern and is one of several culprits for the Viola swoon into the relegation places. We’ve got the numbers here to contextualize how dire the situation is but they, like the stars, offer us no solutions.\n\nMuch of it comes down to that squishiest of hard facts: late-game mindset. Against Torino, Fiorentina dominated the second half, scored twice to overturn an undeserved first half deficit, and seemed to be cruising. The only shot the Granata mustered from minutes 46-80 was Saul Coco’s speculative blast from 30-odd yards. Clearly the Viola defense had bottled up the visitors: Torino had 3 touches in the Viola penalty area and none were threatening.\n\nRight around the 80 minute mark, though, Vanoli lost his nerve. He knew that Marco Baroni’s guys, seeing every opportunity to get something from a fragile opponent, would throw everything forward, and the Viola mister wasn’t sure his guys could weather the storm. To help, he brought on Luca Ranieri for Manor Solomon, adding an out-of-form defender for the winger who’d scored one of Fiorentina’s goals and had a hand in the other. Roberto Piccoli also replaced Moise Kean.\n\nIt’s obviously much easier to say this in hindsight but that was a massive error for three reasons. First, Torino no longer had to worry about Solomon and Kean’s pace. That allowed everyone to move up the pitch, safe in the knowledge that there was no counterattack coming. Indeed, Piccoli did some great work late on in beating 2 defenders and getting down the wing but there was nobody with him by the time he reached the end line and it went for a Torino goal kick.\n\nThe second reason was relational. Having defended with a back 4 for 80 minutes and done it quite well (aside from the opening goal), introducing Ranieri to create a back 5 threw everyone off. Torino easily overloaded the wings, forcing Fiorentina’s midfield 3 to shuffle back and forth across the pitch. That eventually created creases like the one Zakaria Aboukhlal found in stoppage time. Sure, Comuzzo shouldn’t have fouled him. But the Moroccan also shouldn’t have had half the pitch to himself and the Ginger Prince, uncertain about the covering defense, opted to bring him down rather than give him a free run.\n\nFinally, Vanoli’s substitutions told his players that they weren’t on the front foot anymore. Fiorentina’s got the mental and emotional strength of a clinically-depressed rutabaga so seeing the team brimming with confidence en route to retaking the lead was a welcome change. That mindset led to a strong second half performance. By dropping deep, the mister essentially told his players, “I don’t believe that you can keep this up so we’ve got to hang on by our fingernails instead.” Confidence isn’t quantifiable but, for a group like this, anything that could damage it has to be weighed carefully.\n\nIt’s easy to fall into the post hoc facto rationalizations, of course. Vanoli’s a smart coach and understands the game and this roster better than any of us. If Torino hadn’t scored, we’d be applauding his sensible parking of the bus. Alternatively, if he hadn’t changed anything and Torino had still equalized, we’d be fuming about his failure to react to the scoreboard in the final moments.\n\nThis is also an overreaction based on a single outcome. The Torino result was uniquely psychically damaging for a number of reasons, not least because it resulted in the 6th and 7th points lost to late goals over the past 10 league outings. To me, the difference is in perceived strength of the opponent. Fiorentina is terrible and Milan isn’t, so losing that game is irritating but also feels like justice. Losing to Hellas Verona, the worst late-game team in Serie A, is an act of god from which nobody is safe.\n\nTorino, though, is historically a club more or less on par with Fiorentina: not big enough to consistently trouble the Champions League places but too good to accept mid-table anonymity. Getting punked by your betters or ambushed by your inferiors stings but not as much as messing up against an equal. That’s the sort of result that forces you to take a long look in the mirror and reassess who you are.",

    "fullText": "Winning a Super Bowl is the highest mark of success for an NFL head coach. Only a small group of active coaches can say they have done it. Some built long careers around steady success. Others reached the top early in their coaching journey. Each of these coaches shaped their teams in a different way. Their titles show strong leadership, smart planning, and the ability to win on the biggest stage. Here is a look at the active Super Bowl-winning head coaches.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LX)\n\nMike Macdonald is the newest coach to join this list. He led the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl LX win in 2026. Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to earn its second title in franchise history.\n\nHis defensive game plan was the key to the victory. Seattle’s defense controlled the Patriots’ offense from start to finish. Pressure came from all angles and forced mistakes.\n\nThat championship made Macdonald one of the youngest head coaches to win a Super Bowl. The win also proved his defensive style can work at the highest level. Seattle now looks to build around that success for future seasons.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLVII with Baltimore Ravens)\n\nJohn Harbaugh won his Super Bowl with the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII. That victory helped define his long career in Baltimore. He became known as a coach who could win with strong defense and smart special teams play.\n\nHis teams stayed competitive through many roster changes. New players came in and old stars moved on. Success continued because Harbaugh adjusted his approach to fit his personnel.\n\nHowever, following a disappointing 2025 regular season, Harbaugh was fired from Balti\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLIV)\n\nSean Payton earned his Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. His offense stood out for its creativity and balance. Play calling became a major part of his reputation.\n\nLater, he moved to the Denver Broncos to begin a new chapter. Experience gives him an edge in building a culture of discipline and preparation.\n\nOffensive ideas from Payton influenced many coaches around the league. His teams often play with speed and confidence. Denver now relies on that knowledge to return to championship form.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LVI)\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a title in Super Bowl LVI. He became known for modern offensive design and clear communication with his players.\n\nYouth never slowed him down. Playoff runs became common under his leadership. Los Angeles stayed competitive in a tough division because of his planning and play structure.\n\nEach season shows his ability to adapt. Changes at quarterback and defense never stopped his teams from finding ways to win. Many see him as one of the smartest minds in football today.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LIX)\n\nNick Sirianni reached the top with the Eagles during a time when offense ruled the league. His coaching focused on balance and teamwork.\n\nRoster development became one of his strengths. Young players improved quickly under his system. Veterans also fit well into his plans.\n\nPhiladelphia built a strong identity with him in charge. Toughness and energy defined the team’s style. A Bowl win confirmed his place among the league’s top young coaches.\n\nAndy Reid leads this list with three Super Bowl titles. His record shows long-term excellence and steady results. Kansas City became a powerhouse under his leadership.\n\nOffensive creativity sets him apart. Play designs keep defenses guessing every season. Quarterbacks thrive in his system because it allows freedom and structure at the same time.\n\nYears of playoff success place him among the best in NFL history. Consistency defines his career more than any single season. Few active coaches match his résumé.\n\nActive Super Bowl-winning head coaches represent the highest level of achievement in the NFL. Each one reached the top through different paths. Some relied on defense. Others built great offenses. Experience and adaptability connect them all. Their championships show what strong leadership can do for a team. As seasons continue, these coaches will try to add more titles and strengthen their legacy.\n\nThe post Active Super Bowl winning head coaches in the NFL appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Is there a shift going on for Eagles' Jalen Hurts?",
    "fullText": "Jalen Hurts has a different vibe after Eagles’ disappointing run originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNobody within the Philadelphia Eagles’ organization will question Jalen Hurts’ motivation to get back on the Super Bowl stage in 2026.\n\nThey’ve been here before. A few years back, Hurts led the Eagles to the Super Bowl and played nearly a perfect game. It didn’t matter in the end, as the Eagles lost to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIn the following year, the Eagles made it to the playoffs and fell out in the first round. But their window wasn’t closed. They bounced back with a deep playoff run, which concluded with a Super Bowl victory over the Chiefs. Hurts was crowned the game’s MVP.\n\nA pattern continued. The Eagles had a near collapse in 2025 after a solid start. When they got to the Wild Card stage, the Eagles didn’t have anything left in the tank. In a game where they were favored to win, the San Francisco 49ers stunned the Eagles in South Philly.\n\nHurts isn’t walking around with a sour reaction. Again, they’ve been here before. According to the AP’s Rob Maaddi, Hurts has had a different vibe lately. One that says he’s confident that all will be well when the next season fires up.\n\n“This was just one interaction with Jalen Hurts but I noticed he had a different vibe this week,” Maaddi said on X. “Teammates noticed it, too.

    "fullText": "Marc Guehi has quickly adapted to life at Manchester City since signing for the club from Crystal Palace during the January transfer window. Guehi has only made three appearances for City since arriving at the club. The England international has quickly settled into his role in Pep Guardiola’s side. Given Guehi’s pedigree as a centre-back, a person, and a leader, there was little doubt that he would make an immediate impact at City. He has done exactly that. Marc Guehi’s performance as Manchester City beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield was superb, and listening to Guehi speak after the game, he has quickly adapted to life as a player in Pep Guardiola’s system.\n\nThroughout the full 90 minutes as Manchester City beat Liverpool at Anfield, Marc Guehi, alongside Abdukodir Khusanov and Ruben Dias, put in a superb performance at centre-back. Guehi read the game exceptionally well. He also snuffed out danger exceptionally well when Liverpool pressed in the second half. Guehi isn’t the most physically imposing defender, but he knows how to use his body with his positioning supremely well. This stood out throughout yesterday’s match. Outside of the moment where Guehi picked up a yellow card for pulling back Mo Salah, Guehi almost put in a flawless performance at the back. Guehi’s performance was exceptional in a game City had to win, at a venue they typically don’t play well at.\n\nWhat stood out to me after the game, was Marc Guehi’s comments about what it took from his team to beat Liverpool at Anfield. Guehi said that each Manchester City player had to sacrifice for the team to prosper against Arne Slot’s side. In quotes relayed by CityXtra, Guehi explained: “When you’re trying to win games, especially against tough opposition like Liverpool, that’s the standard. It has to be every single person giving every single bit of energy and effort for their brother next to them, and everyone did that today.”\n\nAs Manchester City has embarked on their rebuild, Pep Guardiola has spoken of the importance of team spirit throughout this season. It is a vital ingredient of what typically makes Pep Guardiola’s sides so great. Team spirit underpins everything that City do. The free-flowing and dominant football that is associated with Pep Guardiola teams comes from strong team spirit. Listening to Marc Guehi speak and watching him play, he has fully embraced this side of this Manchester City team. Guehi is often seen celebrating a great defensive effort from his teammates or an inspired save by Gianluigi Donnarumma. These moments might seem small, but they all form an important part of the team spirit that Pep Guardiola is building with his new-look team.\n\nMarc Guehi looks right at home at Manchester City. The England international has slotted seamlessly into City’s defence. He has also fully embraced the team spirit that City is building. That seems like an underrated aspect of this City team, but it is a vital component of what Pep Guardiola is putting together. It also played a key role in Manchester City’s come-from-behind win over Liverpool.",

    "fullText": "MLB Network’s “The Shredder”, an annual ranking system, chose Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman as the best first baseman in MLB.\n\nFreeman has topped the list three years in a row.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Freddie Freeman is the No. 1 first baseman on the #Top10RightNow! pic.twitter.com/kzKjMdrwmW\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Shredder uses past performances, offensive and defensive metrics and MLB Network’s research team’s analysis determine each player’s position on the list.\n\nThe other players listed include the Boston Red Sox’s Willson Contreras, the Chicago Cubs’ Michael Busch, the Baltimore Orioles’ Pete Alonso, the Tampa Bay Rays’ Yandy Diaz, the San Francisco Giants’ Rafael Devers, the Toronto Blue Jays’ Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the Atlanta Braves’ Matt Olson and the Athletics’ Nick Kurtz.\n\nFreeman maintained his spot on the list after yet another fantastic season, grading as well above average in most offensive fields.\n\nhe hit 20 or more home runs for the ninth time in the last 10 seasons, and managed an .800 OPS or higher for the 14th consecutive year. He batted .295 last season, placing third in the NL, and made his fifth consecutive appearance in the All-Star Game.\n\nHaving topped the list last year, it wouldn’t have made sense to move Freeman from the top spot when his numbers improved from 2024. Freeman’s batting average, slugging percentage and OPS all increased from two seasons ago, and he also had more homers and RBIs in the same amount of games.\n\nAs the active hits, runs and RBIs leader, it’s hard to imagine anyone claiming his spot as long as he continues producing at the level he has been.\n\nFanGraphs Depth Charts projects a slight regression from Freeman heading into his 17th season, but believes he’ll match his 24 homers from 2025.\n\nThey project he’ll bat .284 with a .849 OPS, and finish the year with a 135 wRC+.\n\nIf Freeman can maintain these numbers, as he has for most of his career, he’ll surely place towards the top, if not at the top, of the first baseman rankings come next offseason. Freeman surely has bigger things on his mind, though, as the Dodgers are currently in pursuit of their third consecutive World Series title.",

    "fullText": "In the latest act of vandalism against the success of Chelsea, the club have just announced the departure of Paul Green, the Head of Women’s Football for the last 13 years of unprecedented success for the women’s team, building it pretty much from the ground up.\n\nThe club just put out a pretty terse statement given his incredible success and history, just a few paragraphs long, thanking him for his service.\n\nSonia Bompastor on the touchline. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nWe’re no experts on this side of things, so here are some quotes from people who are experts:\n\n“Paul Green’s exit is a major fork in the road for Chelsea, who are now run by sporting directors without women’s football expertise,” said Tom Garry from the Guardian.\n\n“It’s a seismic loss for Chelsea Women. In years to come, we’ll look back at this a bit like David Gill’s departure from Manchester United men, for example.”\n\nIf you want some context for the David Gill comparison – under him it was Fergie, titles and Champions Leagues. After him it’s been David Moyes, Ruben Amorim and mediocrity. If this move is even half as damaging as that, it’s a total disaster.\n\n“It is hard to have much faith in what the club are going to replace him with. A huge amount of institutional knowledge lost,” wrote Jessy PH from the Observer.\n\nChelsea may have won at the weekend, but the way they conceded from a set piece will have been very frustrating for a lot of people. There is a potential solution to solve our increasing concerns about the defensive side of corners and free kicks.\n\nCole Palmer scored three against Wolves, but one journalist pointed out that it was actually another Blue who had been their outstanding attacker in the game.",

    "fullText": "In what was one of the most entertaining contests of the Serie A campaign, Juventus and Lazio shared the spoils with the final score showing 2-2.\n\nPrior to the 45th-minute mark, had someone offered Maurizio Sarri’s men a draw, they would have probably bitten his hand off. After all, the Biancocelesti were disoriented, outplayed, and suffocating from the pressure posed by the Bianconeri, who by all means should have been in the lead if it wasn’t for their lacklustre finishing.\n\nAnd yet, when the final whistle blew, Lazio were left to rue a golden opportunity to complete the double over their northern rivals, as they had squandered a healthy two-goal lead and conceded a 96th-minute equalizer.\n\nSo here are our three takeaways from a thrilling match that may have appeased the neutral but left both sets of players disgruntled with the lack of points they earned.\n\nWhile Alessio Romagnoli’s departure was delayed, it remains very much on the cards ahead of the upcoming summer, as the unhappy defender is still betrothed to Al-Sadd. But while Sarri had depicted the 31-year-old exit as a major tragedy for the backline, Oliver Provstgaard has once again proved he’s up to the task, putting on a big performance against a top opponent.\n\nWatch: Juventus & Lazio Share the Spoils in Four-Goal Thriller – The Highlights\n\nNeedless to say, the Dane cannot be expected to organize the backline and act as a defensive leader at the age of 22, but he offers a robust presence at the back and is willing to put his body in harm’s way.\n\nIf Mario Gila is also destined to leave, then Lazio should try to pair Provstgaard with an experienced profile who can act as a mentor and help him improve his game, as he has the potential to become one of the best centre-backs in the league.\n\nOn Sunday, Sarri was proven right, as Daniel Maldini was indeed the right choice for the centre-forward role. The 24-year-old had a slow start, but he gradually grew into the match and became a thorn in Gleison Bremer’s side, not to mention picking Manuel Locatelli’s pocket to create an out-of-the-blue opening goal.\n\nDaniel Maldini (Photo by Marco Rosi – SS Lazio/Getty Images)\n\nThe versatile attacker is seemingly capable of leading the line in this sort of contest, with Lazio laying low and harrying their opponents on the counterattack. However, it remains to be seen if he can be as effective against compact defences, when he’d have to go shoulder-to-shoulder in tight spaces against centre-backs.\n\nIt should be remembered that the third-generation player often dropped deep or drifted wide on his debut against Genoa, suggesting he wasn’t entirely comfortable with that role. Nevertheless, Sarri will be keen to round out his skill set and win this bet, as he doesn’t seem to be too fond of Petar Ratkov, who represents a more classic version of a centre-forward.\n\nWhen Sarri proclaimed that Matteo Guendouzi wasn’t properly replaced, he certainly had a valid point. The Lazio head coach switched the left-footed Toma Basic to the right side of the midfield trident to fill the gap, but the Croatian has now sustained an injury that could keep him out for a while.\n\nThis knock served as a massive blow for the Aquile, as the lack of quality options in the middle of the park has been exposed. Fisayo Dele-Bashiru came on for Basic, but the Nigerian’s mediocre display justified Sarri’s reluctance to play him. Reda Belahyane is almost in the same boat, while thrusting Adrian Przyborek in this role could be premature.\n\nPlayer Ratings: Juventus 2-2 Lazio – Maldini Announces His Arrival\n\nSince the start of the season, Sarri had insisted that he only sees Danilo Cataldi and Nicolo Rovella as deep-lying playmakers. But as they say, desperate times require desperate measures, and the Tuscan tactician has certainly been forced into making significantly more bizarre choices throughout this unusual campaign than to combine the two Italian midfielders.\n\nOnce fit, Rovella can be easily considered Lazio’s most skilful midfielder, while Cataldi has arguably been the most reliable this term. Hence, dropping one or the other to the bench while fielding underachievers would be criminal.\n\nOn the other hand, a midfield trident of Kenneth Taylor, Cataldi and Rovella could be Lazio’s best possible option at this stage, regardless of which Regista is switched to the box-to-box role.",

I don’t think he won a trophy, but for me, he was part of transforming the club, where it was at that stage, to where it ended up being in terms of being close to winning the Premier League title, getting into the Champions League final.\n\n“If you’re close, then you’re very close to winning.

I’ve never experienced that it will not turn, so I experience it will turn again.\n\n“We can talk about the bottom of the table, or the top of the table, but it’s about the next game.\n\n“I’m fully, fully focused about that. Because there’s also one thing for sure, if you’re too afraid of achieving whatever you want to achieve, you can’t focus, so you just need to focus on your task and need to focus on the next game and do everything you can to win that.\n\n“It’s probably the most competitive Premier League in the five years I’ve been there.

    "description": "AI language models excel in medical exams – but when real people ask them for advice, collaboration fails.",
    "fullText": "Large language models like GPT-4o are now achieving near-perfect results in medical knowledge tests. They pass the US medical licensing exam, summarize patient records, and can classify symptoms. Health authorities worldwide are therefore examining whether AI chatbots could serve as the first point of contact for patients – a kind of \"new gateway to the healthcare system,\" as stated in a strategy paper by the UK's NHS.\n\nHowever, the study \"Reliability of LLMs as medical assistants for the general public: a randomized preregistered study\" by researchers from the University of Oxford significantly dampens these hopes. The work is published in the journal Nature Medicine, and a pre-print version is available on arXiv. The central finding: the clinical knowledge of the models cannot be transferred to interactions with real people.\n\nFor the randomized, controlled study, the researchers recruited 1298 participants from Great Britain. Each subject was presented with one of ten everyday medical scenarios – such as sudden severe headaches, chest pain during pregnancy, or bloody diarrhea. The task: to assess what illness might be present and whether a doctor's visit, the emergency room, or even an ambulance was necessary.\n\nThe participants were randomly divided into four groups. Three groups had access to one AI model each, which was current at the start of the study – GPT-4o, Llama 3, or Command R+. The control group was allowed to use any aids, such as an internet search.\n\nThe results reveal a remarkable discrepancy. Without human involvement, even the language models, which are no longer current, identified at least one relevant illness in 94.9 percent of cases. When asked for the correct course of action – self-treatment, GP, emergency room, or ambulance – they were correct on average in 56.3 percent of cases.\n\nHowever, as soon as real people queried the models, the values plummeted. Participants with AI support recognized relevant illnesses in only a maximum of 34.5 percent of cases – significantly worse than the control group with 47 percent. When choosing the correct course of action, all groups performed equally: around 43 percent accuracy, regardless of whether a chatbot assisted or not.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the chat logs between users and AI models to understand the causes. They identified two central weaknesses: Firstly, participants often provided incomplete information to the models. Secondly, users did not correctly understand the AI's responses – even though the models named at least one correct diagnosis in 65 to 73 percent of cases, participants did not reliably adopt them.\n\nDr. Anne Reinhardt from LMU Munich sees a fundamental gap here: \"Many people quickly trust AI answers to health questions because they are easily accessible. They also sound very convincing linguistically – even when the content is actually medically completely wrong.\"\n\nThe researchers compared the performance of the models on the MedQA benchmark – a standard test with questions from medical exams – with the results of the user study. In 26 out of 30 cases, the models performed better on multiple-choice questions than in interactions with real people. Even benchmark values of over 80 percent sometimes corresponded to user results below 20 percent.\n\nProf. Ute Schmid from the University of Bamberg critically assesses the high performance of the models \"alone\": \"I find the statement that the performance of the language models is significantly higher 'alone' than with users somewhat misleading. In this case, the queries were likely formulated by individuals with expertise and experience with LLMs.\"\n\nThe experts agree that specialized medical chatbots would need to be designed differently from current all-purpose models. Prof. Kerstin Denecke from the Bern University of Applied Sciences outlines the requirements: \"A medically specialized chatbot would need to provide evidence-based, up-to-date information. Furthermore, it would need to reliably recognize emergencies, consider individual risk factors, and transparently communicate its limitations. It should conduct a structured anamnesis to reliably triage. And it should not be tempted to make a diagnosis.\"\n\nHowever, the hurdles for such use are considerable, according to Denecke: \"Major hurdles are, on the one hand, regulation – depending on the function as a medical device or high-risk AI. On the other hand, there is liability, data protection, and technical integration into care processes.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the Oxford researchers is clear: Before AI systems are deployed in healthcare, they must be tested with real users – not just with exam questions or simulated conversations. Schmid advocates for a differentiated approach: \"Quality-assured chatbots could, for example, be offered through statutory health insurance funds and recommended by general practitioners' offices as a first point of access. However, people should not be forced to use these services.\"\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "Sciences Po Saint-Germain near Paris trains current French secret agents and potential new recruits.",
    "fullText": "University professor Xavier Crettiez admits that he doesn't know the real names of many of the students on his course.\n\nThis is a highly unusual state of affairs in the world of academia, but Prof Crettiez's work is far from standard.\n\nInstead, he helps train France's spies.\n\n\"I rarely know the intelligence agents' backgrounds when they are sent on the course, and I doubt the names I'm given are genuine anyway,\" he says.\n\nIf you wanted to create a setting for a spy school, then the campus of Sciences Po Saint-Germain on the outskirts of Paris seems a good fit.\n\nWith dour, even gloomy-looking, early 20th Century buildings surrounded by busy, drab roads and large, intimidating metal gates, it has a very discreet feel.\n\nWhere it does stand out is its unique diploma that brings together more typical students in their early 20s, and active members of the French secret services, usually between the ages of 35 and 50.\n\nThe course is called Diplôme sur le Renseignement et les Menaces Globales, which translates as Diploma of Intelligence and Global Threats.\n\nIt was developed by the university in association with the Academie du Renseignement, the training arm of the French secret services.\n\nThis came following a request from French authorities a decade ago. After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the government went on a large recruitment drive within the French intelligence agencies.\n\nIt asked Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities, to come up with a new course to both train potential new spies, and provide continuous training for current agents.\n\nLarge French companies were also quick to show an interest, both in getting their security staff onto the course, and snapping up many of the younger graduates.\n\nThe diploma is made up of 120 hours of classwork with modules spread over four months. For external students – the spies and those on placement from businesses – it costs around €5,000 ($5,900; £4,400).\n\nThe core aim of the course is to identify threats wherever they are, and how to track and overcome them. The key topics include the economics of organised crime, Islamic jihadism, business intelligence gathering and political violence.\n\nTo attend one of the classes and speak to the students I had to be vetted first by the French security services. The theme of the lesson I joined was \"intelligence and over-reliance on technology\".\n\nOne of the students I speak to is a man in his 40s who goes by the name Roger. He tells me in very precise, clipped English that he is investment banker. He adds: \"I provide consultancy across west Africa, and I joined the course to provide risk assessments to my clients there.\"\n\nProf Crettiez, who teaches political radicalisation, says there has been a huge expansion in the French secret services in recent years. And that there are now around 20,000 agents in what he called the \"inner circle\".\n\nThis is made up of the DGSE, which looks at matters overseas, and is the French equivalent of the UK's MI6 or the US's CIA. And the DGSI, which focuses on threats within France, like the UK's MI5 or the US's FBI.\n\nBut he says it's not just about terrorism. \"There are the two main security agencies, but also Tracfin an intelligence agency which specialises in money laundering.\n\n\"It is preoccupied with the surge in mafia activity, especially in southern France, including corruption in the public and private sectors mainly due to massive profits in illegal drug trafficking.\"\n\nOther lecturers on the course include a DGSE official once located in Moscow, a former French ambassador to Libya, and a senior official from Tracfin. The head of security at the French energy giant EDF also runs one module.\n\nThe private sector's interest in the diploma is said to be continuing to grow. Big businesses, especially in the defence and aerospace sector, but also French luxury goods firms, are increasingly keen to hire the students as they face relentless cyber-security and spying threats as well as sabotage.\n\nRecently graduates have been snapped up by the French mobile phone operator Orange, aerospace and defence giant Thales, and LVHM, which owns everything from Louis Vuitton and Dior to champagne brands Dom Perignon and Krug.\n\nTwenty eight students are enrolled in this year's class. Six are spies. You can tell who they are, as they are the ones huddled together during class breaks, away from the young students, and not too overwhelmed with joy when I approach them.\n\nWithout saying their exact roles, and with arms crossed, one says the course is considered a fast-track stepping stone for a promotion from the office to field work. Another says he gets fresh ideas being in this academic environment. They signed the day's attendance form with just their first names.\n\nOne of the younger students, Alexandre, 21, says he wanted a deeper understanding of the looming economic war between Europe and China. \"Looking at intelligence gathering from a James Bond viewpoint is not relevant, the job is analysing risk and working out how to counteract it,\" he tells me.\n\nAnother class member, Valentine, also 21, says she was inspired by the popular, fictional French TV spy drama Le Bureau. \"Coming here to discover this world which I didn't know anything about except for the TV series has been a remarkable opportunity, and now I am very keen to join the security services.\"\n\nNearly half of the students in the class are in fact women. And this is a relatively recent development according to one of the lecturers, Sebastien-Yves Laurent, a specialist on technology in spying.\n\n\"Women's interest in intelligence gathering is new,\" he says. \"They are interested because they think it will provide for a better world.\n\n\"And if there is one common thread amongst all these young students it's that they are very patriotic and that is new compared to 20 years ago.\n\nIf you are keen to apply to get on the course, French citizenship is an essential requirement, although some dual citizens are accepted.\n\nYet Prof Crettiez says he has to be wary. \"I regularly get applications from very attractive Israeli and Russian women with amazing CVs. Unsurprisingly they are binned immediately.\"\n\nIn a recent group photo of the class you can immediately tell who the spies are - they had their backs to the camera.\n\nWhile all the students and professional spies I met are trim and athletic, Prof Crettiez is also keen to dispel the myth of James Bond-like adventure.\n\n\"Few new recruits will end up in the field,\" he says. \"Most French intelligence agencies jobs are desk bound.\"",

    "fullText": "A hiker captured what he called an \"unprecedented\" moment at France's Isola 2000 ski resort: a massive pack of wolves calmly walking across a groomed ski slope.\n\n\"[I] have never experienced anything like this,\" he told Nice Matin, as reported by The Connexion.\n\nThe video was recorded on December 7, one day after Isola 2000 opened for the season. With the resort still quiet, the hiker encountered seven wolves walking across a freshly groomed slope.\n\n\"It's very, very rare. I'd never seen one before,\" he said, calling the sight \"a truly wonderful encounter.\"\n\nIsola 2000 sits in southeastern France near the Italian border, surrounded by Mercantour National Park — a protected area where wolf packs are known to roam. Still, sightings near developed areas are unusual.\n\nFrance's Office of Biodiversity reported about 15 wolf packs in the department as of 2023. The sighting also follows news of the country's first black-fur wolf pack in the neighboring Var region, suggesting ongoing shifts in regional wolf populations.\n\nThough peaceful, the encounter highlights how development pressures are compressing wild habitats. As resorts and recreation expand, close animal encounters become more likely.\n\nResearch shows humans and wildlife often cross paths in shared spaces — even unintentionally. Repeated exposure may also reduce animals' natural avoidance of people.\n\nSimilar issues are seen in the U.S., where hikers on popular trails have encountered bears with cubs. At the same time, conservation efforts show promise: in Indonesia, a critically endangered Javan rhino was recently born in a protected area.\n\nWolves are protected under French and European conservation law. Officials monitor packs and promote coexistence strategies, such as preserving corridors and limiting early-season disturbances.\n\nVisitors are urged to respect trail closures, keep their distance from wildlife, and recognize that such sightings increasingly reflect the overlap between human activity and natural ecosystems.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "title": "As billionaires bail, Mark Zuckerberg doubles down on California with $50 million donation",
    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

    "fullText": "Hims & Hers (HIMS) stock fell as much as 27% Monday after the Food and Drug Administration announced Friday that the agency planned to take \"decisive steps\" to crack down on the sale of compounded GLP-1s, such as those sold by the company.\n\nThe company is also facing a lawsuit filed on Monday by Novo Nordisk (NVO), the maker of Ozempic, which seeks to bar Hims & Hers from selling compounded versions of its weight-loss drugs.\n\nIn its Friday statement, the FDA announced \"its intent to take decisive steps to restrict GLP-1 active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) intended for use in non-FDA-approved compounded drugs that are being mass-marketed by companies — including Hims & Hers and other compounding pharmacies — as similar alternatives to FDA-approved drugs.\"\n\nPopular GLP-1 drugs include Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Eli Lilly's (LLY) Mounjaro, among other products on the market.\n\nShares ended the day down just over 16%.\n\nHims & Hers sells cheaper versions of these drugs directly to consumers in \"compounded\" forms, which differ slightly from FDA-approved versions but contain the same active ingredient.

    "fullText": "ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s president has warned that the Taliban's government in Afghanistan has created conditions “similar to or worse than” those before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a sign of rising tensions with Kabul after last week’s mosque attack in Islamabad, which analysts said Monday highlights militants’ reach to the capital.\n\nAsif Ali Zardari made the remarks while thanking the international community for condemning Friday's suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque that killed 31 worshippers and wounded 169. Without directly blaming India, Zardari also said Pakistan’s eastern neighbor was “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but regional and global peace.”\n\nIn a statement issued Sunday, Zardari said Pakistan “takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organizations posed threats to global peace.” He added that Pakistan had long maintained terrorism cannot be confronted by any single country in isolation.\n\nThe unusually strong comments were likely to irk Kabul and New Delhi, both of which have condemned the suicide attack claimed by the Islamic State group and have denied any involvement.\n\nThe previous Afghan Taliban government, which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, had been blamed for sheltering the al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden who was behind the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks that killed more than 3,000 people in the United States. The Afghan Taliban also allowed al-Qaida to operate training camps within Afghanistan, despite international warnings. However, bin Laden was killed during a U.S. commando operation in Pakistan in May 2011.\n\nLast week, Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry and New Delhi, in separate statements, rejected the Pakistani allegations, saying Islamabad had irresponsibly linked them to the attack.\n\nPakistan frequently accuses the Afghan Taliban, who returned to power in August 2021 in Afghanistan, of backing militants including the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Both deny the accusations.\n\nThere was no immediate response from India or Afghanistan to Zardari’s latest allegations, which came after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the bomber involved in the attack was a Pakistani and trained by the IS group in Afghanistan.\n\nNaqvi said security forces had arrested four suspects, including an Afghan national accused of links to the militant group and of helping mastermind the attack. The detainees included the bomber’s mother and brother-in-law, according to officials who said investigations into the attack were still ongoing.\n\nPakistan has not shared full details about the involvement of the bomber’s family, however.\n\nOn Monday, Naqvi received telephone calls from his Italian counterpart Matteo Piantedosi and European Commissioner Magnus Brunner, who condemned the mosque attack. According to a government statement, Naqvi maintained that “Pakistan is a shield for the world against terrorism and emphasized that strong global-level measures are needed today to protect the world from terrorism”.\n\nAsif Durrani, Pakistan’s former special representative for Afghanistan, said Zardari’s warning was “unambiguous: terrorism thrives where it is tolerated, facilitated, or used as a proxy.” He wrote on X that “allowing terrorist groups to operate from Afghan soil and India’s use of proxies to destabilize Pakistan is a dangerous path with grave regional and global consequences.” Durrani added, “Peace demands responsibility, not denial.”\n\nAnother Islamabad-based analyst, Abdullah Khan, said the preliminary findings into the mosque bombing suggest the attack may reflect a pattern seen in some IS attacks involving close family networks. He said the IS affiliates have at times recruited entire families, pointing to past attacks in Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nAlthough Islamabad has seen fewer attacks than some other regions, Pakistan has experienced a recent rise in militant violence, much of it attributed to Baloch separatist groups and the TTP, which is separate from but allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban.\n\nThe Islamic State’s regional affiliate, a major Taliban rival, has carried out attacks across Afghanistan.",

    "description": "A supercharged neutrino that smashed into our planet in 2023 may have been spit out by an exploding primordial black hole with a \"dark charge.\" If true, this theory could lead to a definitive catalog ...",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAn impossibly powerful \"ghost particle\" that recently slammed into Earth may have come from a rare type of exploding black hole, researchers claim.\n\nIf true, the extraordinary event may prove a theory that could upend our understanding of both particle physics and dark matter, the team argues. However, this is just one theory, and there is no direct evidence to confirm that this is indeed what happened.\n\nIn early 2023, researchers at the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT) — a massive, newly constructed array of sensors at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea — detected a neutrino, a ghostly particle that has almost no mass and does not readily interact with most matter.\n\nIn addition to neutrinos' typical weirdness, this specific particle was noteworthy for its unusual intensity. It hit our planet with an estimated energy of up to 220 quadrillion electron volts, which is at least 100 times more powerful than any other neutrino detected to date and around 100,000 times greater than anything observed within human-made particle accelerators, like CERN's Large Hadron Collider.\n\nResearchers were initially unsure what caused this \"impossible\" neutrino to appear. It may have been birthed when a cosmic ray entered Earth's atmosphere, unleashing a cascade of high-energy particles that rained down on the planet's surface. However, its unprecedented power led experts to assume that it must have originated from some high-energy cosmic event that we don't fully understand.\n\nIn the new paper, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Physical Review Letters, one research group believes they have finally identified what really birthed the neutrino: an exploding, primordial black hole (PBH).\n\nPBHs are a hypothetical class of black holes that are extremely small — potentially ranging from the size of an atom to a pinhead — and likely date back to the first moments after the Big Bang. The concept was first popularized by British physicist Stephen Hawking in the early 1970s, who also hinted that these miniature singularities would emit large quantities of high-energy particles, dubbed Hawking radiation, as they slowly evaporated. In theory, this would also mean they have the capacity to explode.\n\n\"The lighter a black hole is, the hotter it should be and the more particles it will emit,\" study co-author Andrea Thamm, a theoretical physicist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said in a statement. \"As PBHs evaporate, they become ever lighter, and so hotter, emitting even more radiation in a runaway process until explosion.\"\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries surrounding the impossible neutrino, aside from its immense power, is that it was not observed by other neutrino detectors around the world, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory buried beneath Antarctica's icy surface. Given that PBHs are supposed to be fairly common throughout the universe, one would reasonably expect that similarly powerful particles also would have been detected before or since this possible discovery, especially as the number of neutrino detectors is quickly increasing.\n\nThe researchers said this is because the neutrino was emitted by a special type of PBH, dubbed a quasi-extremal PBH, which has a \"dark charge\" — a version of regular electric force that includes a very heavy, hypothesized version of the electron dubbed a \"dark electron.\"\n\nThe dark properties of this theoretical type of PBH make it less likely that these black holes' explosions would be detected, the researchers suggested. It may also be that some of the less-powerful neutrinos detected to date may be partially incomplete detections of these events, they added.\n\n\"A PBH with a dark charge has unique properties and behaves in ways that are different from other, simpler PBH models,\" Thamm said. \"We have shown that this can provide an explanation of all of the seemingly inconsistent experimental data.\"\n\nWhile the new research hints at the existence of quasi-extremal PBHs, it does not confirm them or prove that they explode as the researchers think. (Regular PBHs have never been directly observed, either, although there is a strong consensus that they exist.)\n\nHowever, the team is confident that it will not take long to prove these dark explosions are real. The same research group recently predicted that there is a 90% chance we will see the first quasi-extremal PBH blow up by 2035, which would be extremely exciting for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, these explosions would be so powerful that they would probably emit \"a definitive catalog of all the subatomic particles in existence,\" including known entities, like the Higgs boson; theorized particles, like gravitons or time-traveling tachyons; and \"everything else that is, so far, entirely unknown to science,\" the researchers wrote in the statement.\n\n—Atom-size black holes from the dawn of time could be devouring stars from the inside out\n\n—A 'primordial' black hole may zoom through our solar system every decade\n\n—Some objects we thought were planets may actually be tiny black holes from the dawn of time\n\nSecond, these black holes could help reveal the mysterious identity of dark matter — the invisible stuff that we cannot see, yet whose gravitational force we can detect within almost every observed galaxy, including the Milky Way. The researchers wrote that quasi-extremal PBHs \"could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe,\" so finding one could help put this mystery to bed. (Despite the similar names, dark matter is not directly related to dark charge or dark electrons.)\n\nThe researchers, along with several other teams in the fields of physics and cosmology, are now holding their collective breath to see when the first explosion might be detected.\n\nThis \"incredible event\" would provide a \"new window on the universe\" and help us \"explain this otherwise unexplainable phenomenon,\" study lead author Michael Baker, a theoretical physicist at UMass Amherst, said in the statement.",

    "fullText": "BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq announced on Monday that a high-level security officer during the rule of Saddam Hussein has been hanged for his involvement in the 1980 killing of a prominent Shiite cleric.\n\nThe National Security Service said that Saadoun Sabri al-Qaisi, who held the rank of major general under Saddam and was arrested last year, was convicted of “grave crimes against humanity,” including the killing of prominent Iraqi Shiite cleric Mohammed Baqir al-Sadr, members of the al-Hakim family, and other civilians.\n\nThe agency did not say when al-Qaisi was executed.\n\nAl-Sadr was a leading critic of Iraq's secular Baathist government and Saddam, his opposition intensifying following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, which heightened Saddam’s fears of a Shiite-led uprising in Iraq.\n\nIn 1980, as the government moved against Shiite activists, al-Sadr and his sister Bint al-Huda — a religious scholar and activist who spoke out against government oppression — were arrested. Reports indicate they were tortured before being executed by hanging on April 8, 1980.\n\nThe execution sparked widespread outrage at the time and remains a symbol of repression under Saddam's rule. Saddam was from Iraq's Sunni minority.\n\nSince the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, authorities have pursued former officials accused of crimes against humanity and abuses against political and religious opponents.

    "title": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show was a perfect artistic statement — except for Lady Gaga's cameo",
    "description": "Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, singing a salsa-inspired rendition of \"Die With a Smile.\"",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny brought the fiesta to the Super Bowl on Sunday, performing reggaeton hits and paying tribute to his Latino heritage — but for a halftime show rich with symbolism and lovingly curated details, one moment felt curiously out of place.\n\nAbout five minutes into Bad Bunny's performance, Lady Gaga materialized out of the blue to sing a salsa-inspired rendition of \"Die With a Smile,\" her popular duet with Bruno Mars from her latest album, \"Mayhem.\" It was a strange choice that, while entertaining enough, felt out of step with the rest of the Puerto Rican superstar's performance.\n\nFrom the moment Bad Bunny stepped on the field, he made the celebratory themes of his performance clear. His set was about Puerto Rican pride: There were dancers dressed as jíbaros in pavas (farmers in traditional straw hats), vendors selling coco frio and piraguas (chilled coconut and shaved ice), and, of course, his signature blend of party-starting beats and culturally significant lyrics.\n\nThe second song in his set list, \"Yo Perreo Sola,\" is sung from a woman's perspective to protest sexual harassment in clubs, while \"Eoo\" pays tribute to the caseríos (public housing in Puerto Rico) where reggaeton was born and nurtured. It was as much a celebration of Puerto Rican history and culture as it was a spectacle for NFL fans, if not more.\n\nSo, as a viewer, when Gaga appeared, there was no obvious reason for her to be there. She didn't cover one of Bad Bunny's songs, as her fellow guest Ricky Martin did later in the show with \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.\" She didn't sing her own beloved song \"Born This Way,\" which would have fit the show's broader themes of unity and acceptance, or even \"Alejandro,\" which incorporates Latin pop production. Instead, she opted for her most recent hit, which had no clear thematic connection (her duet partner, Mars, who has Puerto Rican heritage through his father, was not in attendance).\n\nBecause so much of Bad Bunny's show — from his wardrobe to his props and set design — felt deliberate and carefully planned, Gaga's surprise cameo stuck out even more. It felt as if she were simply filling a gap in the production schedule left open for extra star power.\n\nThis isn't to say Gaga didn't nail her vocals (she always does), or that she had anything but good intentions for accepting Bad Bunny's invitation. The two singers have long expressed respect and admiration for each other; in fact, Bad Bunny is a certified Little Monster. He cited Gaga's music as an entry point for appreciating drag culture, and he gushed over her 2020 album \"Chromatica.\" In 2023, Gaga even introduced Bad Bunny as a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nIt could very well be that Bad Bunny asked Gaga to join his Super Bowl performance because he wanted her there, and to that, I have no objection. Still, if they were saving room in the show for randomness and whimsy, she could've at least sung \"Abracadabra.\"",

Musk did not respond to the investigation at the time.\n\n\"The funny part about that clown's analysis is that even if every bit of bullshit he says is true, it still amounts to less than 1% of the value of Tesla and SpaceX,\" Musk responded on X on Sunday, followed by two crying-laughing emojis. \"Where did the other 99% come from?\"\n\nTesla has a market capitalization of around $1.5 trillion. SpaceX is reportedly planning to go public at a similar valuation later this year.\n\nMusk's retort comes at a time of intense scrutiny of the tech billionaire, his companies, and their reliance on government support. Tesla is facing fresh questions over the feasibility of Musk's vision of self-driving cars and humanoid robots as its core auto business continues to slow. Meanwhile, SpaceX has moved to acquire Musk's AI company, xAI.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Musk replied to another user who wrote that Starlink \"already produces massive cash\" and \"Elon doesn't need military money.\"\n\n\"True. I love NASA, but they will only be ~5% of SpaceX revenue this year,\" Musk wrote. \"Vast majority of SpaceX revenue is the commercial Starlink system.\"\n\nThe world's richest man later replied \"yes\" to a post saying the US government contracts with Musk because he's the \"most efficient vendor\" and saves the government money.\n\n\"SpaceX won the NASA contracts by doing a better job for less money,\" Musk said in a X post last July. \"Moving those contracts to other aerospace companies would leave astronauts stranded and taxpayers on the hook for twice as much!\"\n\nNASA relies heavily on SpaceX for transport to the International Space Station and for key elements of its moon-exploration program, Artemis. The Department of Defense taps Musk's rocket company for tasks such as satellite launches.\n\nAs an electric-vehicle manufacturer, Tesla earns regulatory credits that it sells to other automakers so they can comply with emissions standards and other requirements. Revenue from those accounted for about $2 billion last year.\n\nIn recent years, Musk has taken aim at government subsidies, saying that mature companies shouldn't receive them and public funds are better used elsewhere. His Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cut support programs such as renewable energy incentives last year.",

    "fullText": "YouTube's top creator, MrBeast, is making a leap into fintech by buying a consumer banking app geared toward teens.\n\nHis company, Beast Industries, is acquiring Step, according to a joint announcement sent Monday.\n\nStep, which describes itself as an \"all-in-one\" money app, is a digital banking platform designed to help young people get their financial start. The company offers a mix of services, including savings accounts, a credit-building Visa card that functions similarly to a debit card, and a cash-advance program. Step itself isn't a bank. It offers its banking services via a partnership with FDIC-member Evolve Bank & Trust.\n\n\"Financial health is fundamental to overall wellbeing, yet too many people lack access to the tools and knowledge they need to build financial security,\" Beast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold said in a statement. \"This acquisition positions us to meet our audiences where they are, with practical, technology-driven solutions that can transform their financial futures for the better.\"\n\nThe companies did not disclose the terms of the deal. Step said in 2022 that it had raised $500 million in equity and debt from institutional investors, including General Catalyst, companies such as Stripe, and individuals like TikTok influencer Charli D'Amelio.\n\nBeast Industries, which was valued at about $5 billion in its latest round of funding, has been looking for new avenues to make money beyond media, including the possibility of launching a mobile phone service down the road.\n\nMrBeast's candy and chocolate business, Feastables, has been a big money maker for the influencer, pulling in over $200 million in 2024 revenue, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. Not all ventures have paid off. The MrBeast team is currently embroiled in a legal battle with a business partner over the operations of its burger business, MrBeast Burger.\n\nThe content creator — who has over 460 million YouTube subscribers — has been planning to break into fintech for months, filing a US trademark application for the name \"MrBeast Financial\" in October. The company teased launching a fintech business with services like student loans, insurance, or credit insights in an early 2025 investor pitch deck, Business Insider first reported. The deck said the company would break into the industry by finding a partner who had existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nIn January, when Beast Industries announced it raised $200 million from ethereum holding firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Housenbold said the company would explore \"ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nAs the company prepares to enter the finance business, MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, also said he wants to make videos about finance, such as \"educating people on investing and showing them what is a Roth IRA.\"\n\nDonaldson, who has spoken on many occasions about his personal finances, said in a Monday post on X (formerly Twitter) that he saw the Step acquisition as an opportunity to \"give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.\"\n\n\"Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,\" he wrote.",

    "fullText": "The CEO of Workday is leaving his post, a change that comes less than a week after the software provider laid off about 400 employees.\n\nCarl Eschenbach is being succeeded by Workday cofounder and executive chair Aneel Bhusri, who has held the top job three times before. The company — a software provider for payroll, talent management, and expense processing — said Eschenbach will become a strategic advisor to Bhusri.\n\n\"As we enter a defining moment shaped by AI, there is no one better than Aneel to lead this next chapter,\" said Mark Hawkins, Workday vice chair and lead independent director, in a public statement. \"His vision, conviction, and deep connection to Workday's culture will position the company to continue to lead in a changing landscape.\"\n\nShares of Workday are down roughly 6% today, and down about 43% from a year ago.\n\nBhusri previously served as Workday's co-CEO from 2009 to 2014 with cofounder Dave Duffield. He was also CEO from 2014 to 2020 and co-CEO from 2020 to 2024. Further, Bhusri has been a member of Workday's board since its founding in 2005.\n\nIn announcing the recent layoffs, which affected about 2% of Workday's overall workforce, the company cited a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. It didn't blame artificial intelligence as a reason for the cuts.\n\nWorkday also announced a larger round of layoffs last year, citing a need to invest more heavily in strategic areas such as AI. It had more than 20,400 employees as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWorkday was one of many software companies whose share prices took a beating last week following the debut of Anthropic's industry-specific Claude Cowork plugin, which can perform clerical tasks such as tracking compliance. Others included Intuit, Salesforce, and LegalZoom.\n\nLast month in an interview with CNBC, Eschenbach pushed back on the idea that AI advancements would negatively impact Workday.\n\n\"We are uniquely positioned to be one of the AI winners in the enterprise because of our incumbency, and lastly, because of the trust we get from our customers,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \"We have the cleanest set of data in the industry, and AI is a tailwind for us.

    "fullText": "It wasn't until my junior year at Stanford University that I first heard about ChatGPT from classmates who'd mentioned they had \"chat\" summarize the class reading.\n\nWhen I asked them what they meant by \"chat,\" they told me all about the AI tool, chatGPT.\n\nI was an English major with a creative writing emphasis during my time at Stanford, so reading and writing were important to my work.\n\nI wanted to ask the students who used ChatGPT to do the reading: Why are you even at Stanford? Why be at any university at all? Isn't the point of pursuing higher education to expand our minds and become better communicators?\n\nAs I progressed through my studies, I would hear ChatGPT mentioned more and more often, with some college professors even adding an AI clause to their syllabi. Some instructors would allow students to use ChatGPT for assistance (a murky definition) while others wouldn't allow it at all.\n\nI refused to use the AI tool in any way.\n\nI didn't care if instructors allowed students to use ChatGPT. I deliberately chose not to use it at all.\n\nSure, studying and studying literature in particular was difficult, but this was why I'd chosen the major; it was challenging, and I wanted to become better with words.\n\nI chose to become an English major because I wanted to improve my writing. I lacked confidence in my writing because I didn't know how to use words when I first entered college. I didn't have that finesse.\n\nApart from wanting to become a better writer, I also wanted to defend my opinions and thoughts with flair. I wanted to articulate sentiment precisely and formulate strong arguments. I wanted to write strongly worded emails. I wanted to think and speak freely.\n\nI wouldn't have been able to achieve any of that if I used ChatGPT.\n\nWhenever I'd hear a peer say they just used ChatGPT for their homework assignments, I'd often think about the many deserving students who hadn't been offered a seat at the university — students who, in a heartbeat, would've happily done these assignments themselves.\n\nI had the privilege of studying words at a strong English literature department with so many fine writing instructors. I leaped at opportunities to have my very own work critiqued by great writers. I still can't fathom having \"my\" writing, either partially or entirely synthetic, reviewed by instructors.\n\nAfter all, I was writing in and walking about the same grounds that writing legends once did — writers like bell hooks, John Steinbeck, Karen Zacarías, and David Henry Hwang. With this writing pedigree in mind, I was inspired and motivated to write myself.\n\nNot a day goes by without me putting my English degree to good use. Not a day goes by without me being grateful to my past self for putting in the work to earn the degree herself — without ChatGPT.",

The ads will show up for some of ChatGPT's free users, as well as some users who've subscribed to ChatGPT Go, a new $8-a-month tier the company rolled out last month.\n\nOpenAI says it will serve ads to you based on the conversation you're currently having with ChatGPT, as well as previous queries and chats. It will also factor in whether you've engaged with — or hidden —other ads it has shown you.\n\nFor now, the company says, it won't use data about what you do outside of ChatGPT to target ads inside the service. But I'd be surprised if they don't do that eventually, since just about every other big internet ad platform uses those signals.\n\nThe fact that ChatGPT is launching ads isn't news: The company has been circling the idea for months, and last month it formally announced that ads would be coming to the service.\n\nAnd that news became the subject of a back-and-forth between OpenAI and rival Anthropic, which included a testy social media post from Altman and a cheeky Super Bowl ad from Anthropic underlining the possible trust issues OpenAI may have once ads intermingle with \"organic\" results on the service.\n\nNow we'll see how these things actually look, and work — and what users and advertisers think of them.",

    "description": "Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul would place a lower student-loan limit on certain advanced degrees, including nursing.",
    "fullText": "Nursing programs are taking center stage in the public conversation on President Donald Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul.\n\nPublic comment on the Department of Education's proposed student-loan changes has been open for one week, giving anyone the opportunity to submit feedback. Those changes include new income-driven repayment plans, updates to the handling of defaulted student loans, and new borrowing caps for advanced programs.\n\nThe new borrowing caps, in particular, have sparked conversation and concern among advocates, lawmakers, and students. The department proposed a $100,000 lifetime borrowing limit for graduate students and a $200,000 limit for professional students, and narrowed the programs that would qualify as \"professional\" to 10, including medicine, dentistry, and law.\n\nPost-graduate nursing programs are not included in the professional definition, meaning that students in those programs would not qualify for the higher borrowing limit. Of the over 2,500 public comments received so far, more than 1,200 mentioned nursing. One comment, for example, said: \"During a critical nursing shortage it's vital that nurses are able to advance their education so they can teach the next generation of nurses.\"\n\nAnother comment said: \"Policies that make graduate nursing education less affordable will not only discourage nurses from advancing their education but will also reduce the number of nurse educators available to train the next generation of nurses. Fewer educators mean fewer nursing school slots and longer delays in bringing new nurses into the workforce, and ultimately compromising care.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, previously cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits when asked about concerns on the borrowing caps.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nData from the College Scorecard also showed that most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. Still, many of the comments expressed concern that the caps could exacerbate the existing healthcare shortage. In December, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent, urging him to revise the definition of a professional degree to include postgraduate nursing programs.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the lawmakers said. They referred to the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000 — double the proposed cap for the program.\n\nThe public comment period for the repayment proposals ends on March 2. The department said in a press release that it \"may make changes\" to its regulations based on the feedback it receives before moving toward final implementation this summer.",

A Six Flags park in Maryland had closed down month earlier in November 2025.\n\nAt the start of the new year, the Cartoon Network Hotel serving primarily visitors to the Dutch Wonderland park in central Pennsylvania also shut its doors over a string of financial challenges dating back to the Covid pandemic.\n\nOperating in the British seaside town of Somerset since 1946, Brean Theme Park has become the latest theme park to risk a total shutdown after being assigned liquidators over its financial situation.\n\nThe 80-year-old park was originally a campsite for visitors to the coastline along the Bristol Channel but was expanded into a theme park with rides in the 1970s.\n\nThe park that had become beloved local staple known for its free entry (visitors paid credits for rides they wanted to take) had more than 40 attractions and was preparing to open for the summer season in March when it announced that it was taking \"resolutions for winding-up\" on February 4.\n\nNicholas Stafford of Hazlewoods LLP is the insolvency attorney overseeing the liquidation of Brean in a way that helps creditors and shareholders recoup some of their losses.\n\nAs a former public company, Brean stopped trading at the end of January and, short of a last-minute Hail Mary, will be shuttered forever in the coming weeks. The local notice announcing this decision states that \"the Company be wound up voluntarily.\"\n\nAccording to local reports, visitor numbers dipped significantly during the Covid pandemic, and the theme park was not able to recover from the debt created during that period.\n\nThe closure marks a significant blow to both the Somerset community and vacationers from nearby cities such as Gloucester and Bristol.\n\nThe struggling theme park had been renting land from Unity Holidays, the company also behind parks such as Brean Unity Holidays, Brean Splash, Brean Play, and Brean Gym, reported U.K. outlet Daily Express. Those parks, according to their ownership, will continue to operate in the coming summer.",

Her sold-out concert in Jakarta was canceled after authorities withdrew permission for her to perform.\n\nMore recently, Gaga's performance of \"Abracadabra\" at the 2026 Grammy Awards was cast as \"demonic\" and anti-American by conservative viewers online.\n\n\"Rainbowland\" was originally released in 2017 as the third track on Miley Cyrus' sixth album, \"Younger Now.\"\n\nThe song is a celebration of acceptance and individuality; Cyrus, who identifies as pansexual, duets with her godmother about a world \"where we're free to be exactly who we are.\"\n\nBut in 2023, when a first-grade class in Wisconsin wanted to sing \"Rainbowland\" for their spring concert, school administrators axed the plan.\n\nIn a statement provided to Business Insider, school-district superintendent James Sebert said the teacher who suggested the song \"Rainbowland\" checked with the school principal \"to determine if the song would be acceptable to use in a first grade concert.\"\n\nWhen the principal reviewed the song alongside a district policy about \"Controversial Issues in the Classroom,\" they \"determined that the song could be deemed controversial in accordance with the policy,\" the statement said.\n\nLil Nas X's \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" rode a wave of conservative backlash to a No. 1 debut on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song is about \"gay sex,\" in Lil Nas X's own words. He told Genius that he intentionally included some explicit lyrics to help \"normalize\" queer lust in music.\n\nThis angered some parents, who claimed Lil Nas X betrayed children who loved his hit single, \"Old Town Road.\"\n\nThe \"Montero\" music video — which shows Lil Nas X riding a stripper pole down to hell and giving Satan a lap dance — also sparked outrage from conservative pundits and politicians, including Candace Owens, a right-wing media personality, and Kaitlin Bennett, better known online as the Kent State \"gun girl,\" as well as commentators on Fox News.\n\nThe controversy even elicited a response from South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who slammed Lil Nas X for promoting the song by releasing a limited line of \"Satan Shoes.\"\n\nRight-wing media personalities had a collective meltdown in 2020 when Cardi B released \"WAP,\" her hit collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nThe song delights in filthy wordplay and explicit expressions of lust, with both rappers bragging about their healthy signs of arousal.\n\nConservative talk-show host Ben Shapiro even took the time to read the lyrics of \"WAP\" on his live radio show, declaring, \"This is what feminists fought for.\"\n\nCardi wasn't fazed: \"I can't believe conservatives soo mad about WAP,\" she tweeted, and reposted a collection of fan-made memes about Shapiro reciting her \"vulgar\" lyrics.\n\nMegan told Time she was \"taken aback\" by the backlash: \"Like, why is this your focus right now? If you have an issue with what I'm saying don't listen to it. Tune out, 'cause I didn't ask you to tune in.\"\n\nCardi also responded to the outrage surrounding their rendition of \"WAP\" at the 2021 Grammys, which reportedly drew more than 1,000 complaints to the FCC. Fox News host Tucker Carlson told viewers, \"they're intentionally trying to degrade our culture and hurt our children,\" while Candace Owens called the performance \"a destruction of American values.\"\n\n\"Yaaaayyyyyyy WE MADE FOX NEWS GUYS !!! Wap wap wap,\" Cardi wrote on Twitter.\n\nTaylor Swift became a target for conservative politicians and members of the alt-right when she broke her political silence in 2018, endorsing two Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee.\n\nThe following year, Swift built on this momentum with \"You Need to Calm Down,\" a pro-gay song that explicitly advocated for the Equality Act, a bill that would create antidiscrimination regulations for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nConservative websites like The Daily Signal slammed the song's message, while Kellyanne Conway, then serving as senior counselor to the president, used Swift's own lyrics to mock her activism.\n\nIn recent years, Swift has become a favored target for Trump, who wrote \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" on Truth Social after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024.\n\nChildish Gambino's \"This Is America\" became a cultural phenomenon in 2018, praised for its harsh commentaries on gun violence and systemic racism. It went on to win record of the year at the Grammys.\n\nHowever, not all reactions were positive. Run-of-the-mill conservatives called it \"evil garbage\" on social media, while professional conservatives wrote scathing essays about its \"superficial\" lyrics and \"paranoid\" message.\n\nFar-right political commentators like Alex Jones and Gavin McInnes were similarly scandalized, describing the music video as a \"voodoo dance\" and declaring, \"Black violence is a bonfire.\"\n\nFox News pundits were up in arms after Kendrick Lamar's powerful performance of \"Alright\" at the 2015 BET Awards.\n\nThe song features lyrics condemning racism and police brutality (\"We hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho\").\n\n\"This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years. This is exactly the wrong message,\" Fox News anchor Geraldo Rivera said.\n\nLamar later responded to Rivera's comments during an interview with TMZ.\n\n\"How can you take a song that's about hope and turn it into hatred?\" he said. \"Hip-hop is not the problem. Our reality is the problem of the situation.\"\n\nThe rapper also sampled the news segment on his 2017 album \"Damn.\"\n\nIn 2010, one year before \"Hannah Montana\" ended, Cyrus released a new single called \"Can't Be Tamed.\"\n\nThe electro-pop song celebrates freedom and self-expression, especially in the face of scrutiny. In the music video, Cyrus plays a caged bird who is gawked at and photographed.\n\nIn response, the Media Research Center issued a statement titled \"The Miley Cyrus Effect: Young Girls Acting Like (Trashy) Adults.\"\n\nThe right-wing group, which describes itself as \"America's media watchdog,\" slammed Cyrus for \"dancing provocatively\" and apparently normalizing \"highly sexualized representations of women.\"\n\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" was released as Katy Perry's official debut single in 2008.\n\nHowever, she had previously released contemporary Christian music under her birth name, Katheryn Hudson.\n\nThe song's queer fantasy inspired a small moral panic from her former audience. Adam Holz of PluggedinOnline — a division of the conservative and anti-gay organization Focus on the Family — condemned the song in an article titled  \"A Tale of Two Katys.\"\n\n\"At the moment, Katy Hudson's flirty and 'dirty' alter ego is in the ascendant. Whether or not she'll ever 'come to her senses' as the Bible says the prodigal son did in Luke 15 remains to be seen,\" Holz wrote.\n\nHe added: \"Katy is indeed living down to a damaging, demeaning stereotype, one that our culture has already branded as 'girls gone wild.' Perhaps one day she'll recall the wisdom of her youth.\"\n\nInstead, as the years went on, \"I Kissed a Girl\" was seen as increasingly problematic on the other side of the aisle. Many progressives have criticized the song for trivializing lesbian relationships and feeding a biphobic narrative.\n\nPerry told Glamour in 2018 that she would change the lyrics if she were to release the song today: \"Lyrically, it has a couple of stereotypes in it. Your mind changes so much in 10 years, and you grow so much.\"\n\n\"Goodbye Earl\" is now known as one of The Chicks' most iconic hits, but when it was released as a single in 2000, some people were alarmed.\n\nThe song, written by Dennis Linde and initially recorded by Sons of the Desert, tells the story of two women named Mary Ann and Wanda, who murder Wanda's abusive husband with poison.\n\n\"The debate centers on whether the record sheds light on the problem of domestic violence or condones a murder by the abuse victim and her friend,\" the Los Angeles Times wrote at the time.\n\nIndeed, many country radio stations refused to play the song.\n\nThe backlash even compelled The Chicks to include a disclaimer in the album's liner notes: \"The Dixie Chicks do not advocate premeditated murder, but do love getting even.\"\n\nThree years later, The Chicks came under fire for criticizing then-President George W. Bush and the Iraq War. Conservative fans began boycotting their music, demanding that radio stations do the same. A group of protesters even bulldozed their CDs.\n\nBruce Springsteen wrote \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" after Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by New York City police in 1999.\n\nThe four officers fired 41 shots after Diallo, who was unarmed, apparently reached for his wallet. They were indicted on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment, but eventually acquitted of all charges.\n\nThe song includes the lyrics, \"You get killed just for living in your American skin.\"\n\nSpringsteen performed \"American Skin\" at Madison Square Garden in 2000, which prompted fury from the NYPD.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, Springsteen was criticized by then-Mayor Giuliani, then-Police Commissioner Howard Safir, and Patrick J. Lynch, then-president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, who urged officers to boycott Springsteen's concerts.\n\nIce-T's hard-rock project Body Count is most famous for their 1992 single \"Cop Killer,\" a protest song about racial profiling and police brutality.\n\nShortly after its release, then-President George H. W. Bush condemned \"sick\" rap songs and other forms of \"filth\" that \"rejoice in standing up against law enforcement.\"\n\n\"It is wrong for any company,\" he said, apparently referring to Ice-T's label Time Warner, \"to issue records that approve of killing a law enforcement officer.\"\n\nVice President Dan Quayle also criticized the song as \"outrageous.\" Senator Al Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, who's partially responsible for \"Parental Advisory\" labels on CDs, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post that compared Ice-T's rhetoric to Hitler's.\n\n\"As Nasty as They Wanna Be,\" the 1989 album from rap group 2 Live Crew, was banned from sale in southern Florida after a US District Court declared the album \"legally obscene.\"\n\nIn his opinion, U.S. District Judge Jose A. Gonzales Jr. of Fort Lauderdale wrote that 2 Live Crew's lyrics \"are replete with references to female and male genitalia, human sexual excretion, oral-anal contact, fellatio, group sex, specific sexual positions, sado-masochism, the turgid state of the male sexual organ, masturbation, cunnilingus, sexual intercourse, and the sounds of moaning.\"\n\nAs the Washington Post reported, possession of obscene material in Florida was punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. Some record store owners were arrested and convicted for selling the album.\n\nMembers of 2 Live Crew group were also arrested for performing the album in Broward County.\n\nIn 1992, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling on the grounds of artistic value.\n\nN.W.A.'s iconic protest song \"Fuck Tha Police,\" which appeared on their 1988 album \"Straight Outta Compton,\" was so reviled by law enforcement that it elicited rebuke from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nMilt Ahlerich, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Public Affairs, mailed a letter to the group's label, Priority Records, calling the song \"discouraging and degrading.\"\n\n\"Advocating violence and assault is wrong,\" he wrote, \"and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.\"\n\nIndeed, many police officers boycotted N.W.A. and refused to provide security for their concerts.\n\nIn 1977, amid Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee celebrations, the Sex Pistols released a song calling her reign \"the fascist regime.\"\n\nThe anti-monarchist sentiments of \"God Save the Queen\" were immediately condemned by conservatives across the nation, as well as by media companies like the BBC, which instituted a total ban on the song from its radio stations.\n\nLondon Councilor Bernard Brook Partridge, a high-profile Conservative Party politician, described The Sex Pistols as \"the antithesis of humankind\" and said he wished for their \"sudden death.\"\n\nAccording to the Guardian, the band was \"hassled by police and attacked by nationalist thugs.\" Some tabloids even accused them of treason.",

    "description": "Bolt Data and Energy was recently cofounded by Eric Schmidt and raised $150 million. Now it's in talks to have Google anchor Texas campus.",
    "fullText": "Bolt Data and Energy, a data center development firm that was cofounded late last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is negotiating a deal that would allow it to begin construction on a large data center project it is planning in West Texas.\n\nSchmidt's firm is in discussions with Google, his former employer, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. The tech giant, one of the leaders in the race to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence, is considering a commitment of 250 megawatts, according to one of the people. The other person said it was too early to characterize the exact size of the potential transaction because it was still under discussion.\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the potential transaction is still being arranged and the talks are confidential.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" a Google spokeswoman told Business Insider, declining to comment further. Google announced last year that it plans to build $40 billion of cloud and AI infrastructure in Texas by 2027.\n\nThe potential deal highlights how Big Tech is racing to secure the power, physical infrastructure, and land needed to fuel AI, even as the costs and financial risks of those bets loom.\n\nIn December, Bolt completed its first funding round, raising $150 million from investors, including $50 million from Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a public company that owns large tracts of land in West Texas. As part of the investment from TPL, Bolt will develop data centers on land in TPL's portfolio.\n\nA presentation detailing Bolt's development plans, shared with Business Insider, said that TPL's land would give it access to abundant power and water for cooling. These commodities have become increasingly strained as data center development has boomed around the country.\n\nThe presentation states that Bolt's development would begin with an \"initial 250 megawatt facility\" and expand in 250-500 megawatt increments into a 5 gigawatt campus.\n\nBolt's plan is one of several large-scale projects that have been envisioned in Texas to cater to the AI race. Fermi, a public company co-founded by former Texas governor and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has plans for an 11-gigawatt campus in Amarillo.\n\nIn December, Business Insider revealed that Amazon had pulled back a $150 million cash advance it had pledged as part of a preliminary deal to anchor the project. Fermi's disclosure of the reimbursement of that advance caused its stock to fall by 50%. Fermi's CEO, Toby Neugebauer, told Business Insider that although Amazon had reclaimed its advance, the negotiations for it to take space with Fermi were still ongoing.\n\nMajor bank lenders who extended $38 billion to finance the construction of data center campuses in Shackleford County, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, for Oracle and OpenAI, meanwhile, have had difficulty selling off pieces of the huge loan to other banks and investors. Those troubles stem, in part, from worries about whether Oracle's credit will be strained by its massive AI spending.\n\nTo help allay concerns, Oracle announced it would raise as much as $50 billion in debt and equity in 2026 to continue to pursue its AI buildout while also maintaining \"a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it plans to spend between $175 and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, roughly double its outlay in 2025. The spending is being done largely to pay for AI equipment and infrastructure.\n\nA record wave of spending has been announced by big technology companies on AI this year, including Amazon's disclosure during its earnings last week that it would spend $200 billion alone this year.\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "Hey Meta, are you also nostalgic for 2016?\n\nAs social media users wax poetic and share throwbacks about the social media heyday of 2016, it seems Meta wants to revive a piece of it.\n\nThe tech giant is working on an internal prototype of a new stand-alone app for sending disappearing photos, a spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nYes, that does sound like Snapchat's original premise.\n\nAccording to a screenshot shared by mobile developer Alessandro Paluzzi, who reverse engineers Instagram to reveal prototypes, the app is being called \"Instants.\"\n\n\"Share disappearing photos with friends,\" Paluzzi's rendering says.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said the stand-alone Instants app is not testing externally.\n\n#Instagram is working on a standalone app for Instants/Quicksnap 👀 pic.twitter.com/d56vOeoGap\n\nInstagram has also been testing a feature called Instants, which was previously called \"Shots,\" with some users of its main app. It has been a limited test available to \"some countries globally,\" the Meta spokesperson said.\n\nThe Instants feature lets Instagram users quickly send disappearing photos in their direct-messaging inbox. Once the photo message is opened, the photo disappears and expires 24 hours after sending, per Instagram's Help Center.\n\nInstants can only be \"sent to followers you follow back,\" the same help page says. The photos cannot be edited.\n\nThis isn't the first time Instagram has rolled out disappearing messaging tools.\n\nIn 2016, Instagram launched tools for disappearing text and photos in its DM product. The platform also introduced \"Vanish Mode\" in 2020, which lets users turn on disappearing messages by swiping up in the DM thread. These features are still live within the Instagram app, but Instants would be a new way to send disappearing content to friends.\n\nA new app from Meta shouldn't come as a surprise. It's rolled out several stand-alone apps in the company's recent history, including Threads, Edits, and Meta AI.\n\nInstagram has been doubling down on ways for friends — which Meta defines as people who mutually follow each other — to interact on the app.\n\nInfluencers, the rise of the creator economy, and advertising have turned Instagram into more of an entertainment platform than a social media platform. Now, people post less frequently to the main feed or stories, and instead, share content directly in DMs with their friends and family.\n\nHead of Instagram Adam Mosseri told Business Insider last year that there's been a \"paradigm shift\" toward more private sharing (like DMs) on the platform.\n\nMeta seems to be looking at Snapchat as a frequent source of inspiration for how people communicate with their closest friends.\n\nDisappearing messages aren't the only way Instagram has imitated Snapchat. Stories, famously, was a clone of Snapchat's highly successful product. Last year, Instagram also launched a social map feature similar to Snapchat's Snap Map.\n\nThere's a reason Snap CEO Evan Spiegel keeps \"VP Product @ Meta\" in his LinkedIn bio.",

    "description": "The recent tech sell-off spooked Wall Street, sparking a rerating of AI stocks. One analyst shares his criteria for picking winners in the AI race.",
    "fullText": "The tech stock sell-off that rattled Wall Street last week served as a reminder to investors that AI hype works both ways, and endless enthusiasm is no longer lifting all boats.\n\nThe dramatic downturn hit software stocks hardest, but it also spilled into the broader tech sector. Major indexes have broadly recovered from last week's sell-off, but investors are still on edge about what could be the next shoe to drop.\n\nAccording to Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman, the sell-off was a \"healthy, overdue rotation and a market demanding receipts.\"\n\n\"Ignore hype and look at growth and constraints,\" he told Business Insider. The analyst also shared some tips for picking AI stocks.\n\nHere is the framework Newman says he's using to spot winners and losers as the AI trade evolves.\n\nNot all companies spending on AI are seeing it pay off. While many on Wall Street chalk this up to the early innings of the emerging tech, companies that are seeing AI drive revenue are ones to look for.\n\n\"Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,\" Newman said.\n\nHe highlights Amazon and Microsoft as examples of AI spending fueling revenue real growth, through the tech giant'' respective cloud businesses, AWS and Azure.\n\nCompanies creating their own silicon chips are better positioned to compete. Capacity constraints control the AI race, with chip demand outpacing supply.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all working on their own custom AI chips.\n\nNewman highlighted that companies with in-house chips benefit from capacity advantages and vertical integration, which set them up for better margins.\n\nCompanies that have been successful in seeing a return on their AI spending have been largely focused on enterprise offerings. These include the cloud hyper scalers, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as Palantir, a favorite among retail traders.\n\nSome software companies are seeing enterprise monetization, despite the worries that sparked this week's sell-off. Newman highlights ServiceNow and IBM as \"companies driving agentic AI workflows and token consumption.\"\n\nElon Musk told Tesla investors on the company's most recent earnings call that its humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate up to $10 trillion in long-term revenue.\n\nNewman said that physical AI is the next multi-trillion-dollar market outside of data centers. He called out Amazon and Tesla as companies bringing AI to the physical world.\n\nThe market zeroed in on the software space for good reason, Newman said. \"I don't believe the AI will eat all software, but AI will eat some software,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe analyst explained that software companies with data running core business applications can survive in an AI era, but they will have to adapt to meet the needs of enterprise customers who want AI insights to fuel productivity gains.\n\nSome software companies partnering with AI factories include Salesforce and ServiceNow.\n\nAs AI-disruption concerns continue to fuel market skittishness, investors should be wary of companies without a clear narrative for how capex will deliver tangible results.\n\nAnother sign that an AI stock is risky may be that a company is using debt to finance AI infrastructure buildouts. Newman clarified that while debt isn't always a bad thing and can be a way to invest in critical growth, it can make a stock more of a risk-on play.\n\nIn a risk-off environment, Newman told Business Insider that there are a couple of things investors should be watching for.\n\n\"Look at the companies that can really afford to keep investing, for businesses that are going to basically create the cash flow that do it with the least risk.\"",

    "title": "West Coast Marines want to train 500 new drone pilots a year in a crash course on everything from flying to explosions",
    "description": "A new crash course is teaching Marines the ins and outs of drone warfare, from navigation in flight to explosive payloads.",
    "fullText": "West Coast Marines are learning how to operate attack drones in a new training course, part of a broader push to accelerate drone readiness across the force.\n\nThe new fast-paced crash course packs a lot into 15 days, teaching Marines how to fly the drones, handle aerial navigation, and safely prepare and deploy explosive payloads made with C-4.\n\nMarines spend several days on a drone simulator before progressing to cheap, expendable, off-the-shelf drones. From there, students move on to more complex systems, including drones built in-house by instructors and the Marine Corps' Neros Archer drone. Neros received a $17 million contract from the service last year for around 8,000 of its small drones.\n\n\"The simulators allow them to develop the core skills that we can then transition to our smaller drone for them to refine,\" said 1st Lt. Braeden McClain, an infantry officer overseeing the course.\n\nSo far, the course has certified 75 Marines as attack drone operators and hopes to graduate 500 a year. These aren't formal military occupational specialties like the positions tied to larger drone platforms; instead, the focus is on spreading drone training across the force.\n\nMuch of the training focuses on mission execution and safety, McClain told Business Insider. Marines fly drones through makeshift PVC gates, testing flight dexterity and aerial navigation as they guide the aircraft to grid coordinates for a strike. The drills are deliberately team-based, reflecting lessons the Marine Corps has drawn from the war in Ukraine, McClain said.\n\nMarines rotate through multiple roles — pilot, team leader, communications support, and payload preparation — while planning missions in detail, establishing checkpoints, and practicing \"talking on target,\" the process of verbally guiding a drone operator onto an objective. Each role comes with challenges, such as factoring in payload weight, radio frequencies, and wind, among other things.\n\n\"We've noticed that really the issue that most Marines struggle with is not the actual flying of the drone itself; it's kind of some of the more fundamental concepts, like aerial navigation,\" McClain said. \"Most Marines have never flown before, so now having them try to navigate through the air is a bit challenging.\" Having course instructors who were already hobby drone enthusiasts has been a boon, he said.\n\nThe training effort is part of a broader push to get American troops trained on drone operations as quickly as possible, a task that marks a sharp departure from the military's historically slow approach to adopting new technology. In recent months, the Pentagon has prioritized rapid defense modernization and closer collaboration with industry as battlefield lessons from Ukraine highlight how quickly drone warfare is evolving.\n\nLast year, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo directing the Pentagon to quickly overhaul drone acquisition and fielding processes in an effort to \"unleash\" US military drone dominance, including a push to field more than $1 billion worth of attack drones through 2028.\n\n\"Our acquisition system is designed to reduce acquisition risk to zero,\" Lt. Gen. Benjamin Watson, who oversees the Marine Corps' Training and Education Command, told reporters at the Modern Day Marine symposium last year. \"We've got to field drones at scale in order to be able to pressurize our training, really to work through some of the real hard problems.\"\n\nThe Marine Corps began authorizing more widespread drone training late last year as part of that Pentagon-wide push, and it is now seeking to add 10,000 drones to its inventory over the coming year.\n\nThe First Marine Division program operates under the broader umbrella of the Corps' lead organization for drone training, the Attack Drone Team headquartered in Quantico, Virginia. The Corps stood the team up last year to help develop standardized training pipelines across the force.\n\n\"Right now, our focus is on rapidly building proficiency by sending Marines to a variety of training courses and increasing hands-on familiarization,\" Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, the headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion, which oversees the Attack Drone Team, said last year. \"Our goal is to ensure they can not only operate these systems effectively but also integrate them seamlessly into a team.\"\n\nThat emphasis on team-based drone employment, and on constantly absorbing battlefield lessons from the war in Ukraine, means the course will have to continuously evolve, something not routinely seen in US military training.\n\nSuch immediate evolution is common in Ukraine though, where drone schools are updating their lessons frequently, as often as every two weeks, to keep up with developments on the battlefield.\n\nShifts in drone warfare have become a cat-and-mouse game, with each new tactic forcing a rapid counter. Radio-frequency drones are now routinely jammed, and that electronic warfare has driven the emergence of fiber-optic drones that are largely resistant to interference.\n\n\"At this rate, we see a significant advancement every three to six months,\" McClain said, describing how quickly tactics and technology are changing. \"Flexibility is definitely the name of the game.\"",

    "fullText": "Major players in the agricultural industry are sounding an economic alarm in a joint letter, according to The New York Times.\n\nA bipartisan group of agriculture industry leaders has called upon the Trump administration and Congress to reverse course on tariffs and other economically restrictive measures. The letter said many of these have increased costs, disrupted market access, blocked access to labor, and stopped important agricultural research. Combined, these effects were deemed catastrophic.\n\n\"Our farmers and ranchers can compete with the world, but they can't compete with the world with a chaotic set of policy circumstances,\" said former chief executive of the National Corn Growers Association, Jon Doggett, per The New York Times.\n\nOther signers included Buzz Mattelin, the previous president of the National Barley Growers Association, and Bart Ruth, the previous president of the American Soybean Association.\n\nDomestic agriculture helps people in the U.S. meet their dietary needs. Collapse of the industry would also create steep economic and cultural loss. The challenges imposed by government policy are compounded by a wildly erratic climate.\n\nExisting and ongoing pollution is trapping heat in the atmosphere, which exacerbates destructive weather trends. This includes floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires, all of which pose existential threats to farmers. These weather shifts have also introduced new opportunities for the proliferation of pests, which could obliterate staple crops.\n\n\"Congress needs to assert itself on behalf of farmers if we are to avoid a widespread collapse of American agriculture and our rural communities,\" said the letter.\n\nThe letter recommended nine actions to alleviate the pressure on American farmers. These included exempting farm inputs from tariffs, supporting more trade agreements, and restoring funding to agricultural research.\n\nWhile institutional action is needed, there are individual actions that can be taken.\n\nAdopting a plant-based diet can ensure cropland is being used efficiently to feed people. Likewise, switching to an EV can cut the demand for ethanol otherwise used in running a traditional car. Ethanol production uses up roughly 40% of America's corn production.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower tariffs, reconfigure energy ties and deepen economic cooperation ​as both seek to realign global supply chains.\n\nThe India–U.S. joint statement suggested that New Delhi pushed back against Washington's efforts to ‌broadly open its agricultural market. However, India has agreed to lower trade barriers on some farm goods, drawing criticism from farmers and opposition parties.\n\nWHO GAINS FROM INDIA'S DECISION TO ALLOW ‌IMPORTS OF DDGS AND SOYOIL, AND WHO LOSES OUT?\n\nIndia is expected to allow imports of protein-rich distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a byproduct of ethanol made from corn and other grains, from the United States, adding to a surplus in the domestic market.\n\nHigher supplies of DDGS could benefit India's nearly $30 billion poultry sector, where feed costs account for around 60-70% of total production expenses, by helping reduce expensive feed purchases.\n\nDomestic oilseed processors and soybean farmers, however, may ⁠lose out if U.S. imports rise.\n\nThere are already ‌surplus supplies of DDGS in India, weakening demand for oilmeals such as soyameal, putting pressure on Indian oilseed prices and prompting farmers to switch from soybean and peanuts to corn and rice, despite New Delhi's push to boost ‍oilseed cultivation and curb imports.\n\nAs supplies of DDGS increase further, India's ethanol producers - already struggling with idle capacity and slowing demand after the country achieved its 20% biofuel blending target - may face lower earnings from DDGS sales in the domestic market.\n\nProspects of duty-free imports of soyoil from the U.S. have raised some concerns in India. ​But, under the current framework, duty-free soyoil imports will be allowed only under a tariff-rate quota, meaning volumes above the quota will face ‌standard tariffs, a move aimed at protecting domestic producers.\n\nWILL DUTY-FREE COTTON IMPORTS AFFECT INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia currently imposes an 11% duty on cotton imports, and allowing duty-free imports from the world's largest exporter of the fiber could put pressure on domestic prices.\n\nHowever, the impact is expected to be limited, as the government has permitted only imports of extra-long staple cotton, and that too under a quota.\n\nAlthough India is the world's second-largest cotton producer, it struggles to meet the textile industry's demand for extra-long staple cotton, which it imports from the U.S., Egypt, Brazil and Australia.\n\nDO CONCESSIONAL IMPORTS OF APPLES ⁠AND DRY FRUITS THREATEN INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia is the world's fifth-largest apple producer, but domestic ​supplies fall short of rising demand, driven by population growth and increasing prosperity.\n\nNew Delhi ​imports around 500,000 metric tons of apples annually from Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, the U.S. and Chile. Under a trade deal with the U.S., imports will be allowed at a concessional duty of 25% and a minimum import price of 80 ‍rupees per kg, effectively preventing shipments ⁠below 100 rupees per kg and helping protect Indian farmers.\n\nConsumption of dry fruits such as walnuts, almonds and pistachios has also been rising in India. Domestic production of these commodities is limited, so concessional imports are unlikely to affect local farmers.\n\nARE INDIAN FARMERS LIKELY ⁠TO BENEFIT FROM THE TRADE DEAL?\n\nIndian growers of tea, coffee, spices and fruits are set to gain from the trade deal, as the U.S. has granted duty-free access for ‌these products.\n\nThe reduction of import duties on rice to 18% is also expected to support exporters of both premium basmati and ‌non-basmati varieties.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny's halftime show was the real star of Super Bowl Sunday. I caught his performance from the stands of Levi's Stadium.",
    "fullText": "\"Look for us on TV!\" I told my parents before my fiancé and I headed to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, for our very first Super Bowl.\n\n\"Oh, we're not going to watch the game,\" they replied. \"But can you text us before Bad Bunny comes on?\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl halftime show might have been even more anticipated than the Big Game. And after a lackluster performance from the New England Patriots against the Seattle Seahawks, it was clear that the real star of Sunday was Bad Bunny.\n\nHere's what it was like to watch his halftime show from the Super Bowl stands.\n\nWe got a sneak peek at Bad Bunny's set as we watched people wheel out carts with tall tufts of grass, a nod to the sugarcane fields of his native Puerto Rico.\n\nI assumed the extras were going to dance, but they were actually added to accommodate rules for protecting the natural grass at Levi's Stadium.\n\nBruce Rodgers, who has produced the Super Bowl halftime show for the past two decades with his company Tribe Inc., told Wired that the NFL limited how many carts could be wheeled out onto the football field. So the team decided to dress up performers to help re-create the lush greenery of Vega Baja, Bad Bunny's hometown.\n\nAndrew Athias, one of the extras, told Business Insider that the grass costume weighed 40 pounds. He flew to California from the East Coast and spent two weeks in rehearsals to be part of the field cast.\n\n\"I got paid $18.70 per hour for the gig, but I would've done it for free,\" he said.\n\nDraped across every seat in the stadium was a football necklace with a lanyard decorated with Bad Bunny's name.\n\nOur necklaces automatically lit up during the performance, providing the glow you could see during the halftime show telecast.\n\nLa Casita, a major stage piece from Bad Bunny's \"No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí\" residency, arrived at the end zone for the Super Bowl halftime show — just not the one we were behind!\n\nStill, the excitement was palpable as Bad Bunny kicked off his 15-minute performance with \"Tití Me Preguntó.\" One guy in front of me even started FaceTiming his friend, holding the phone so she could watch the entire show.\n\nBad Bunny walked through the tall grass, passing by various set pieces that paid homage to Puerto Rico — including stands selling Coco Frio and piraguas — at the start of his performance.\n\nFrom the stands above, all we could see were the tops of the grass. However, a jumbotron directly across from our seats showed us what fans at home were seeing on their TV screens.\n\nEveryone around me was confused when the jumbotron in front of us kept cutting away from Bad Bunny to show random images, including some leaves and a cityscape.\n\nPeople quickly realized that the screen behind us was still showing the halftime show, so we wondered if the stock images were due to a technical issue.\n\nWhen I rewatched the show at home, I noticed our jumbotron was often visible on camera. I'm not an expert in production design, but I figure the decision might have been made to make it look less distracting in the telecast.\n\nI found out that stars including Cardi B, Alix Earle, Pedro Pascal, and Jessica Alba made a quick surprise cameo during the halftime show, thanks to excited texts from my friends who were watching from home.\n\nLady Gaga was also a total surprise for the fans in the stands, and I just about lost it when she appeared to sing a salsa version of \"Die With a Smile.\"\n\nAlas, I have no pictures of this moment because I was too busy crying tears of joy.\n\nWatching the couple say \"I do\" from the stands was a quick but special part of the show, especially when it was later revealed via ESPN that the couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to their wedding — only for him to invite them to get married during his Super Bowl performance instead.\n\n\"The only thing more powerful than hate is love,\" the sign read, evoking Bad Bunny's statement during his Grammys acceptance speech the week prior.\n\nThe stadium erupted as Bad Bunny began singing \"DTMF,\" his message emblazoned for all to see — no matter where we were sitting.\n\nAs fireworks lit up California's slowly darkening blue sky, I knew I had just watched something historic.",

    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has again done what the rest of the US military has repeatedly failed to do with its finances — account for its money.\n\nThe Corps, the only US military service to pass a clean financial audit, announced its third successful audit on Monday.\n\nThe Department of Defense, which was recently authorized to receive a new annual budget of nearly $840 billion a year and could see a substantial increase to $1.5 trillion under the current Trump administration, has consistently failed to pass an audit since audits became legally required for the military in 2018.\n\nPentagon officials hope the military can get its books in order across the services and pass one by 2028.\n\n\"The Marine Corps' audit process enabled accurate global tracking and reporting of financial transactions, inventory of facilities, equipment and assets, and accounting for taxpayer dollars spent during the last fiscal year,\" read a Marine Corps release, \"The auditors also tested the Marine Corps' network, key business systems, and internal controls.\"\n\nThe result reflects years of effort to modernize financial and logistics systems that have long been siloed across units, making audits agonizingly challenging, said Lt. Gen. James Adams III, the deputy commandant for programs and resources, during a media roundtable. Such bottlenecks have been a long-standing problem across the Defense Department and are a major focus of Pentagon reforms.\n\n\"We want to modernize our systems so they're digitally connected, so that we can do audits in the future that are controls-based,\" said Adams, who is set to depart his position soon to lead the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nHistorically, fragmented military networks have made everything from force-wide equipment tracking to financial oversight difficult, requiring tedious manual reconciliations. While the Corps still relies heavily on human review, officials say automation and artificial intelligence are already reducing the burden.\n\n\"Right now, we still take a lot of data and move it onto a macro spreadsheet that our accountants are reviewing, and that's just a lot of work,\" said Edward Gardiner, the assistant deputy commandant for programs and resources. AI tools can help flag discrepancies and pinpoint errors, he said. Officials pointed to one automation system that saved 20,000 hours of painful reconciliation work.\n\nAuditors still found seven \"areas of weakness\" in the audit, a common feature even among organizations with clean audits, though Adams told reporters the Corps has prioritized fixes to those areas that pose the greatest risk to financial accuracy after its audits, rather than trying to eliminate all concerns at once.\n\n\"Passing our third consecutive audit is a direct reflection of who we are as Marines,\" the Corps' commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, said in a statement. \"Discipline, accountability, and stewardship are not administrative tasks; they are part of our warfighting culture.\"",

During his time on the team, Jegannathan worked to incorporate more AI tools in sales and service team workflows, five people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\n\"A comprehensive end-to-end understanding of the business has been essential—enabling the team to harness AI effectively to achieve meaningful outcomes across products and customer support,\" Jegannathan wrote on LinkedIn on Monday.\n\nThe executive, who reported directly to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left the company over the weekend, a person with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider. Jegannathan has not been active on internal company systems since late January, and he has not worked closely with the sales team for a few months, people with knowledge of the issue said.\n\nPrior to taking over leadership of the sales team, Jegannathan worked in engineering and IT, rather than sales. He has worked at Tesla for over 13 years. Shortly after he took the reins, he became known for responding to sales and service requests on X.\n\nJegannathan has led the company through a tumultuous sales period. Tesla reported in January that its delivery numbers fell for the second year in a row. The carmaker reported a 16% year-over-year decline in deliveries during the quarter. Jegannathan led the sales efforts while Musk worked with the federal government as a part of the Department of Government Efficiency, before the organization was dismantled.\n\nSeveral of Musk's direct reports have left the company over the past year. One of Musk's top lieutenants, Omead Afshar, parted ways with the carmaker in June, and Milan Kovac, the head of Tesla's robotics division, left the company that same month.\n\nTesla and Jegannathan did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is threatening to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, a long-awaited new border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said he would not allow the bridge to open until the US is \"fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" adding that Canada must treat the United States with what he described as \"fairness and respect.\"\n\n\"We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY. With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,\" Trump added.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is expected to be completed in early 2026 and has been under construction since 2018. The $6.4 billion project is entirely funded by Canada's Federal government, and will feature six lanes and a pedestrian and cycling path.\n\nThe University of Windsor's Cross-Border Institute estimated in a 2021 study that the new route will save about 850,000 hours a year for trucks, which would mean billions of dollars in savings over the bridge's lifetime. The study also found that the Windsor-Detroit corridor is the largest pathway for trade between the US and Canada.\n\nTrump's remarks mark the latest escalation in tensions with Canada, a key US trading partner, as the president steps up his criticism of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moves forward with a trade deal with China.\n\nHe also bristled at comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which were widely seen as an implicit rebuke of Trump's foreign and economic policies. In January, Trump also warned that he could impose a 50% tariff on aircraft manufactured in Canada and revoke certification for newly produced planes.\n\nThe White House and the Ontario Premier's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consume...",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consumer advocates and Democrats now estimate have cost Americans at least $19 billion in financial relief.\n\nIn a report provided to The Associated Press ahead of its release by the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday, the authors say the CFPB harmed consumers by abandoning major consumer protections, stalling investigation and dismissing a number of lawsuits.\n\n“Trump’s attempt to sideline the CFPB has cost families billions of dollars over the last year alone,” said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, as well as one of the bureau’s fiercest defenders in Congress.\n\nThe administration and congressional Republicans have argued that the bureau needed to be downsized and reined in because it had grown too large and overreaching.\n\nThe administration assumed control of the CFPB in February 2025 after Rohit Chopra, the bureau’s director under President Joe Biden, resigned, leaving White House budget director Russell Vought as acting director. Since then, few new investigations have been opened, many employees have been ordered not to work and several pending enforcement actions against financial companies have been dropped.\n\nThe White House announced in April that it wanted to reduce the Bureau’s staff from 1,689 positions to 207 positions, but that move has been blocked by courts. Even if the employees’ union does succeed in its lawsuit against Vought, Congress cut the bureau’s budget by roughly half in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It’s unlikely that all of those employees will still have their jobs once all litigation is settled.\n\n“The CFPB may still be standing, but it’s essentially on life support,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director at Consumer Reports, in a statement. Consumer Reports put out its own data Monday that arrives at similar conclusions as Warren's office.\n\nA spokeswoman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne form of relief the report said consumers were denied was a limit on overdraft fees, which the Biden CFPB finalized in 2024 but the Republican-led Congress overturned last year. That would have saved consumers $5 billion a year, according to the Bureau’s estimates at the time.\n\nThe bureau also tried to cap the amount of money consumers pay to credit card companies when they pay their bills late. That would have saved Americans roughly $10 billion, according to Bureau estimates when the rule was proposed. The regulation was blocked by a federal court last year, and the bureau, under the control of the Trump administration, decided not to fight the lawsuit in court.\n\nAnother roughly $4 billion in consumer relief would have come from a series of lawsuits or settlements that were dismissed by the bureau under Acting Director Vought. For example, the bureau sued Capital One in January 2025 for $2 billion, days before President Trump was to be sworn into office, alleging that Capital One has misrepresented the interest rate paid on its savings accounts to customers. That lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nThe bureau also sued Early Warning Systems, the company that runs the money transfer service Zelle, in December 2024 for $870 million alleging that the EWS and the banks that operate Zelle were negligent in protecting consumers from fraud and scams. That lawsuit was also dismissed last year.\n\nThere's also been a slowdown in the number of complaints resolved by the bureau as well. The CFPB runs its own consumer complaint database, where a consumer can allege wrongdoing by their bank or financial services company and the bureau will act as intermediary between the consumer and financial company to resolve the complaint. Under the Biden CFPB, roughly half of all consumer complaints were resolved with relief for the consumer, whereas under the Trump CFPB, that figure has dwindled to less than 5%.\n\nThe independent Government Accountability Office made public a separate report Monday outlining its attempts to keep track of the Trump administration’s reorganization and restructuring of the CFPB. The GAO said it received no cooperation from the White House or the bureau, and the GAO needed to rely on mostly public records to produce its report. In a response to the GAO, the CFPB cited ongoing litigation between its employees and management as the primary reason why it could not cooperate.\n\nThe GAO’s report largely matches what has been documented in news reports that the bureau has cancelled dozens of enforcement actions against alleged wrongdoers, unwound rules and regulations that previous bureau management said would protect consumers or bring them financial relief. There have been even rules and regulations enacted during President Trump’s first term that have been targeted by the bureau’s current management.\n\nMark Paoletta, the bureau's chief legal officer and effectively its deputy director under Vought, called the GAO’s report “biased and flawed” in a letter to the agency did not raise any specific issues with its conclusions, other than to say the GAO was working with incomplete information.",

    "fullText": "California still has it over Texas in at least one key way, Elon Musk says: Hiring.\n\nAfter moving the headquarters of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. to Texas in recent years because of politics, he said it’s still easier to recruit employees to work in California. With one exception.\n\n“Austin, it helps,” Musk said — while noting that Tesla still has most of its engineering capacity in California. “Getting engineers to move … I call it the significant other problem.”\n\nThat’s what makes engineering recruiting toughest at Starbase, the remote South Texas outpost where SpaceX is developing its Starship mega-rocket.\n\n“For Starbase that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low,” Musk said. “It’s quite difficult. It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The general counsel for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Monday warned the attorney for an anonymous government employee not to directly share a top-secret complaint about Gabbard's handling of classified material with members of Congress.\n\nThe letter to attorney Andrew Bakaj is the latest escalation in the back-and-forth accusations over the classified complaint, which alleges that Gabbard withheld top-secret material for political reasons.\n\nTwo inspectors general for the intelligence community reviewed the claim and found that particular allegation did not appear to be credible. Gabbard has denied any wrongdoing and said she did all she could to ensure the report reached Congress.\n\nDemocrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees have blasted Gabbard's office over the handling of the complaint, questioning why it took eight months for it to be sent to select members of Congress as required by law.\n\nHere's what to know about the complaint and the next steps:\n\nWhat is known about the complaint\n\nThe anonymous author of the complaint works for a U.S. intelligence agency and in May filed a report claiming that Gabbard withheld classified information for political reasons. Gabbard oversees the coordination of 18 intelligence agencies.\n\nThe complaint made two allegations, according to a memo sent to lawmakers by the current inspector general, Christopher Fox: The first is that the “distribution of a highly classified intelligence report was restricted for political purposes,” while the second accuses Gabbard's general counsel of failing to report a potential crime to the Justice Department.\n\nIn June, the inspector general at the time, Tamara Johnson, found that the claim Gabbard distributed classified information along political lines did not appear to be credible, Fox said in the memo to lawmakers. Johnson was “unable to assess the apparent credibility” of the accusation about the general counsel’s office, Fox wrote.\n\nThe watchdog said he would have deemed the complaint non-urgent, meaning it never would have been referred to lawmakers.\n\n“If the same or similar matter came before me today, I would likely determine that the allegations do not meet the statutory definition of ‘urgent concern,’” Fox wrote.\n\nThe New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported that the complaint stemmed from a call between two foreign nationals that mentioned someone close to President Donald Trump and was intercepted by the National Security Agency. The news reports, which cited anonymous sources, said the discussion involved Iran and that Gabbard notified the White House personally, while the complaint accused her of blocking the NSA from reporting the interaction to other agencies. The AP could not immediately confirm the reports.\n\nThe NSA declined to offer details about the complaint Monday, saying in a statement that it works closely with the FBI and others to investigate the mishandling or disclosure of classified information.\n\nGabbard's office warns attorney\n\nBakaj, a former CIA officer and an attorney for the person making the complaint, offered to meet with certain lawmakers or their staffs to discuss the allegations and his concerns about Gabbard's review.\n\nODNI's general counsel warned against that in its letter Monday, noting that Bakaj or his client could face criminal charges if they improperly revealed classified material during the briefing.\n\n“The highly classified nature of the underlying complaint increases the risk that you or your client inadvertently or otherwise breaks the law by divulging or mishandling classified information,” the general counsel's office wrote. “You may have other means of appearing in front of Congress, but this is not it.”\n\nBakaj did not immediately respond to questions Monday about the letter.\n\nUnder federal law, intelligence whistleblowers are entitled to ask to refer their complaints directly to key lawmakers even if the inspector general finds them non-credible, so long as they deem the allegations urgent. That determination was made by the original watchdog, but the complaint didn’t reach lawmakers until last week.\n\nCopies of the top-secret complaint were hand-delivered beginning last week to the “Gang of Eight” — a group comprised of the House and Senate leaders from both parties as well as the four top lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nAdditional meetings for the remaining members are tentatively set for Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats decry delay as GOP backs Gabbard\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he will push Gabbard for more answers about the underlying complaint and why it took so long to get the report to lawmakers.\n\nThe number of redactions make it hard to evaluate the allegations, he said.\n\n“The fact that this sat out there for six, seven, eight months now and we are only seeing it now, raises huge concerns in and of itself,” Warner said Sunday on CBS' “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe Republicans who lead the intelligence committees are backing Gabbard, making it less likely the panels take further steps to investigate the complaint.\n\n“It seemed like an effort by the president’s critics to undermine him,\" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Senate Intelligence Committee's chairman, wrote Saturday on X.\n\nIntelligence chief responds to critics\n\nGabbard noted in a lengthy social media post Saturday that Johnson was appointed interim inspector general for the intelligence community during President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nShe included a detailed timeline that she said shows she acted quickly to ensure the complaint reached Congress. Gabbard wrote that she was aware of the complaint in June and believed the investigation had ended after it was found non-credible, only for the inspector general’s office to inform her in December that the complaint had to be reviewed, redacted and sent to members of Congress.\n\n“I took immediate action to provide the security guidance to the Intelligence Community Inspector General who then shared the complaint and referenced intelligence with relevant members of Congress last week,” Gabbard wrote.\n\nShe also accused Warner and the media of trying to use the complaint to smear her name.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings under a bill that was signed in September following the summer of high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit in November challenging the laws, arguing that they would threaten the safety of officers who are facing harassment, doxing, and violence and that they violated the constitution because the state is directly regulating the federal government.\n\nJudge Christina Snyder said she issued the initial ruling because the mask ban as it was enacted did not also apply to state law enforcement authorities, discriminating against the federal government. The ruling could have national implications as states grapple with how to deal with federal agents enforcing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nIt left open the possibility to future legislation banning federal agents from wearing masks if it applied to all law enforcement agencies, with Snyder writing \"the Court finds that federal officers can perform their federal functions without wearing masks.” The ruling will go into effect Feb. 19.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill in September banning some law enforcement officers from wearing masks, neck gaiters, and other facial coverings. It was slated to go into effect Jan. 1 but was put on hold due to the lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to exempting state law enforcement officers, it made exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and other situations where not wearing a mask would jeopardize an operation. Snyder sided with the federal government, which argued this exemption was discriminatory against federal agents.\n\nNewsom also signed into law a measure requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job, which was challenged by the federal government but upheld by the judge.\n\nCalifornia State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the original bill to ban facial coverings, said Monday he would immediately introduce new legislation to include state police in the law.\n\n“ICE and Border Patrol are covering their faces to maximize their terror campaign and to insulate themselves from accountability,” Weiner said in a news release. “We will ensure our mask ban can be enforced.”\n\nAt a Jan. 14 hearing, Snyder repeatedly asked the government’s lawyer, Tiberius Davis, to explain why banning masks would impede the federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties, if officers rarely wore masks prior to 2025.\n\nDavis cited claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that there has been a multifold increase in assaults and threats against federal officers. He also brought up an incident in Los Angeles where three women are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.\n\n“There is real deterrence on the officer’s safety and ability to perform their duties,” Davis said.\n\nCameron Bell, California Department of Justice attorney, challenged his claims, saying there was no concrete evidence that federal agents can’t perform their duties without facial coverings.\n\nBell referenced declarations from U.S citizens who have been detained by federal agents but thought they were being kidnapped.\n\n“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” Bell said.\n\nThe federal government also argued in legal briefs that allowing California’s legislation could lead other states to be “emboldened to impose similar unconstitutional restraints.”\n\nDavis cited a statement from Newsom in July 2025 during an interview posted online where he discussed the mask ban bill, saying, “It appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents but we do for other law enforcement authorities.”\n\nLos Angeles County supervisors voted in December to enact a local ordinance banning law enforcement from wearing masks that went into effect Jan. 8. However, the sheriff’s department said it would not enforce the ordinance until after the court ruled on the statewide mask ban. The Los Angeles Police Department had also said it wouldn’t enforce the mask ban.",

    "description": "Not cool, YouTube. Not cool.",
    "fullText": "My subscription fatigue is real, but at the end of the day, I do recognize that companies need to make money. If one of them manages to put together a compelling package of features for a reasonable price, I can decide whether or not I find that value worth the money. That's fine. What isn't fine is offering a feature for free for years, and then suddenly deciding to lock it behind a paywall.\n\nIt seems YouTube didn't get that memo. Starting on Saturday, outlets like 9to5Google began reporting that YouTube Music had started to remove the ability to vie lyrics for free users. If you want a full lyrics experience, you'll need to The service hasn't cut these users off cold turkey. According to anecdotal user experiences, YouTube Music is opening lyrics access to free users for five songs per month. Once they play song number six, they'll only have access to the first two lines of each song, as the rest of the lyrics will be blurred out. These users will have to wait until the following month to view another five songs.\n\nThere appears to be no confusion about why the lyrics are blurred out, either. When you switch to the \"Lyrics\" tab on YouTube Music as a free account, a new banner appears, telling you how many views you have remaining. Beneath this, you'll see the option to \"Unlock lyrics with Premium,\" a clear message that, unless you pay up, you only get a limited number of lyrics views. This, apparently, follows a months-long period where YouTube Music tested lyrics as a Premium-only feature.\n\nFor what it's worth, when I tried to see what the current lyrics situation looks like on my free YouTube Music app, the service gave me two weeks of Premium for free, with no option to skip it. That's, um, nice of YouTube, but since I already have an Apple Music subscription, the only real consequence here is that I can't test these new lyrics limitations out.\n\nI don't see the strategy here. Lyrics aren't something I feel people would feel compelled to pay for specifically—but they might be annoyed enough at losing them to look elsewhere. Spotify, for example, offers a full lyrics experience for free users. It was only last week the company added offline lyric downloads for Premium users only, but, even then, that's adding a feature for the subscription tier—not taking away an existing feature from free users.\n\nIt's not just Spotify, either. Other free music streaming services offers lyrics, as well, including Pandora, Amazon Music Free, and Freefy. These are largely radio services, so you may not have as much flexibility as you would have with YouTube Music free—but, hey, you at least have lyrics.\n\nLosing lyrics isn't the end of the world for free YouTube Music users, either. Just about any song's lyrics can be found on the internet. Sometimes, the lyrics show up in a Google search window without you needing to even click a link. Otherwise, sites like Genius and AZLyrics do exist. It's just a bummer YouTube feels the need to gatekeep the in-app experience.",

    "description": "A researcher had free access to messages sent on the app Chat & Ask AI.",
    "fullText": "Have you ever used an application called Chat & Ask AI? If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.\n\nChat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.\n\nThe problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n\nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.",

    "title": "You Can Opt Out of Ads on ChatGPT, but It Might Not Be Worth It",
    "description": "You don't have to see ads in ChatGPT, but you'll get less ChatGPT in return.",
    "fullText": "It finally happened. After months of speculation, ChatGPT officially has ads. OpenAI revealed the news on Monday, announcing that ads would roll out in testing for logged-in adult users on Free and Go subscriptions. If you or your organization pays for ChatGPT, such as with a Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you won't see ads with the bot.\n\nOpenAI says that ads do not have an impact on the answers ChatGPT generates, and that these posts are always clearly separated from ChatGPT's actual responses. In addition, ads are labeled as \"Sponsored.\" That being said, it's not exactly a church-and-state situation here. OpenAI says that it decides which ads to show you based on your current and past chats, as well as your past interactions with ChatGPT ads. If you're asking for help with a dinner recipe, you might get an ad for a meal kit or grocery service.\n\nThe company claims it keeps your chats away from advertisers. The idea, according to the company, is strictly funding-based so that OpenAI can expand ChatGPT access to more users. That's reportedly why ads are starting as a test, not a hardcoded feature: OpenAI says it wants to \"learn, listen, and make sure [it gets] the experience right.\" As such, advertisers don't have access to chats, chat histories, memories, or your personal details. They do have access to aggregate information about ad performance, including views and click metrics.\n\nOpenAI will only show ads to adults. If the service detects that you are under 18, it will block ads from populating in your chats. Ads also will not appear if you're talking to ChatGPT about something related to health, medicine, or politics. You can offer OpenAI feedback on the ads you do see, which should inform the ads you receive in the future. You can also delete your ad data and manage ad personalization, if you want to reset the information OpenAI is using to send you ads.\n\nThe thing is, you don't actually have to deal with ads, even if you use ChatGPT for free. That's not just by upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan, though OpenAI does suggest that option in its announcement. In addition, OpenAI is offering Free and Go users a dedicated choice to opt out of ads here. There is, of course, a pretty sizable catch: You have to agree to fewer daily free messages with ChatGPT. OpenAI doesn't offer specifics here, so it's not clear how limited the ad-free experience will be. But if you hate ads, or if you simply don't want to see an ad for something irrelevant to your ChatGPT conversation, it's an option.\n\nIf you like that trade-off, here's how to opt out of ads. Open ChatGPT, then head to your profile, which opens your profile's Settings page. Here, scroll down to \"Ads controls,\" then choose \"Change plan to go ad-free.\" Select \"Reduce message limits,\" and ChatGPT will confirm ads are off for your account. You can return to this page at any time to turn ads back on and restore your message limits.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "title": "Your Browser's Extensions May Be Reading Your Passwords",
    "description": "Take these steps to mitigate the damage.",
    "fullText": "We should all take common-sense steps to make sure our data stays safe and secure: use strong passwords with our accounts, and never reuse passwords; employ two-factor authentication on any account that offers it; and avoid clicking strange links in emails or text messages. But even when you follow all those rules, your personal data can still be at risk, strictly because the services you rely on aren't following these rules themselves.\n\nResearchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison discovered that a concerning number of browser extensions can access sensitive information that you enter into websites. Think passwords, credit card info, and Social Security numbers.\n\nThe team behind the discovery says they weren't out looking to break a security story. Instead, they were \"messing around with login pages,\" specifically Google login pages, when they found that the sites' HTML source code could see the passwords they entered in plain text. They turned their sights onto other websites—more than 7,000, reportedly—and found that about 15% of them were also storing sensitive information in plain text. That's over 1,000 websites exposing important data.\n\nThat, of course, is not supposed to happen: When you enter sensitive data into a website—say, your password into Google's login page—that site shouldn't see your password at all. In short, the sites confirm your passwords through hashing algorithms—essentially, jumbling your password into a code that can be checked against the code the site stores on their end. They can then confirm you entered the right password without ever exposing the actual text. By storing things like passwords and Social Security numbers in plain text, those sites are exposing that data to anyone in the know.\n\nImportantly, that includes browser extensions. The researchers claim that 17,300 Chrome extensions—or 12.5% of the extensions available for download on Google's browser—have the permissions they need to view this sensitive plain text data. Think about the permissions you ignore when setting up a new extension, including permissions that give extensions full access to see and change what you enter on a webpage. Researchers didn't expose any extensions by name, as the situation is not necessarily the fault of the extensions, but considering the scope, it's possible some of the extensions you use can access sensitive information you enter in certain sites.\n\nAgain, legitimate extensions are not the priority: Instead, it's the risk that a developer will create an extension with the intent of scraping sensitive info stored in plain text. While the researchers claim there are no extensions actively abusing this vulnerability yet, this isn't a theoretical problem. Researchers created an extension from scratch that could pull this user data, uploaded it to the Chrome Web Store, and got it approved. They took it down immediately, but proved it's possible for a hacker to get such a malicious extension on the official store. Even if the hacker didn't make the extension, they could acquire a legitimate extension with an existing user base, adjust the code to take advantage of the vulnerability, and spring the updated extension on unsuspecting users. It happens all the time, and not just on Chrome.\n\nUnfortunately, there's little you can do to prevent these sites from storing your passwords, credit cards, and Social Security numbers in plain text. The hope is, following these discoveries, websites will improve their security and kill the vulnerabilities on their end. But that's on them, not you.\n\nThere are some steps you can take to mitigate the damage, however. First, make sure to limit your use of browser extensions. The fewer extensions you use, the less likely it is you'll use a malicious one. Use only extensions you fully trust, and frequently check in on updates. If the extension changes hands to a new developer, vet that new owner before continuing to use it. You could even disable your extensions when sharing sensitive information with websites. If you need to provide your Social Security number on an official web form, for example, you could disable your extensions to prevent them from reading the data.\n\nYou can also limit the data you share that could stored in plain text. If given the option, use passkeys instead of passwords, as passkeys don't actually use any plain text data that hackers could steal. Similarly, use secure payment systems, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay, which don't actually share your credit card information with the website you're making a payment on. The name of the game is to avoiding typing out your sensitive details unless absolutely necessary—and then, reducing the parties who can see those details.",

    "fullText": "Communications minister Anika Wells points to media reports alleging children can access spaces meant for adults which include explicit sexual content\n\nFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updates\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nReports of child grooming and vile content on popular game service Roblox has “alarmed” the communications minister, Anika Wells, who has demanded the platform explain how it is addressing sexual and self-harm material, and that its PG rating be examined by the Australian Classification Board.\n\nThe eSafety commissioner has also written to the game platform, saying it plans to test the promises it made about keeping children safe online, including disabling chat features and making underage accounts private.\n\n“We remain highly concerned by ongoing reports regarding the exploitation of children on the Roblox service, and exposure to harmful material,” the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said.\n\nRoblox has come under scrutiny after reports that children can be exposed to inappropriate content on the platform, which allows users to create their own mini-games inside the system.\n\nGuardian Australia published a report last November documenting a week of virtual sexual harassment and violence. While playing as an eight-year-old girl, the reporter was given a sexualised avatar, cyberbullied, aggressively killed, sexually assaulted and shat on – all with parental control settings in place.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nWhile platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Kick were included in Australia’s under-16s social media ban, gaming sites such as Roblox were not.\n\nWells and her department were investigating other levers to regulate services such as Roblox.\n\nThe minister has written to Roblox requesting an urgent meeting, saying she was “alarmed by reports of children being exposed to graphic and gratuitous user-generated content on the platform, including sexually explicit and suicidal material”.\n\n“Even more disturbing are ongoing reports and concerns about children being approached and groomed by predators, who actively seek to exploit their curiosity and innocence,” she said in the letter.\n\nGuardian Australia understands Roblox has not yet responded to the letter. In a statement on Tuesday, a Roblox spokesperson said it was committed to keeping users safe, saying it had recently rolled out features like age checking systems, and was working with Australian law enforcement to keep users safe.\n\n“We look forward to the opportunity to inform the minister of the steps we take to help keep our community safe. Roblox has robust safety policies and processes to help protect users that go beyond many other platforms, and advanced safeguards that monitor for harmful content and communications,” they said.\n\n“While no system is perfect, our commitment to safety never ends, and we continue to strengthen protections to help keep users safe.”\n\nIn her letter, Wells pointed to media reports alleging children can access spaces on the game meant for adults which include explicit sexual content, and charges laid against a Queensland man accused of grooming hundreds of children on platforms such as Roblox, Fortnite and Snapchat.\n\nWells has also asked the eSafety commissioner about any short-term measures that could be taken, and separately has written to the classification board to ask if Roblox’s PG rating remains appropriate.\n\nIn the letter to Roblox, Wells noted the company had worked with the eSafety commissioner on additional safety measures for children but that issues appeared to continue.\n\n“This is untenable, and these issues are of deep concern to many Australians parents and carers,” she wrote, saying she was keen to hear what Roblox was doing to prevent adults contacting children, and to protect children from inappropriate experiences.\n\nThe eSafety office said it had also written to Roblox last week, saying it planned to test how the platform was complying with commitments such as making under-16s private by default, new tools to prevent adult users from contacting children and restricting chat features. After that testing, eSafety foreshadowed it “may take further action under the Online Safety Act”.\n\n“I welcome the minister for communications’ correspondence and the Australian government’s support on this important issue as we use all of the tools available to us to keep Australian kids safe online,” Inman Grant said.",

    "description": "Super Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at - this is how a thunderous evening in California panned out.",
    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Head coach Andy Farrell has largely been a loyal selector throughout his Ireland tenure but will last week's heavy loss in Paris lead to changes for Italy in Dublin on Saturday?",
    "fullText": "When Andy Farrell took charge of Ireland after the 2019 World Cup, Joe Schmidt's erstwhile defensive specialist faced calls to radically overhaul a team that had clearly dropped from a considerable peak.\n\nIn 2018, Ireland had won a Six Nations Grand Slam and beaten New Zealand in Dublin as part of an autumn clean sweep.\n\nThen, having been the head coach in waiting for a year, there was a feeling that Farrell's association with the previous ticket got his tenure started on the back foot.\n\nYet, by the time of his first game in charge in February 2020, Farrell resisted any temptation to enforce a major break from the Schmidt regime, his biggest selection calls revolving around replacing retired veterans Rob Kearney and Rory Best.\n\nWhile handing an international debut to Caelan Doris was a nod to the future, the naming of the then 34-year-old Johnny Sexton as his captain was a clear indication of a focus on the here and now.\n\nAs Ireland muddled through a pair of third-place Six Nations campaigns disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Farrell remained steadfast in his approach of evolution rather than revolution and was rewarded for his faith with a historic series win in New Zealand in 2022 and a Six Nations Grand Slam the next year.\n\nIn the wake of Thursday's humbling defeat by France in Paris to start the 2026 Six Nations however, Farrell has faced the strongest calls since those earliest days of his tenure to dramatically overhaul the team.\n\nWith Italy in Dublin on Saturday afternoon, will the head coach stick or twist?\n\nSaturday, 14 February, 14:10 GMT\n\nListen to full match commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra 2, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Sport website and app alongside live text commentary\n\nWhile Farrell was accurate when judging his 2020-21 squad as one in transition rather than terminal decline, the mood music around the team feels even more sombre this time around.\n\nIt may only be two years ago that Ireland were chasing the history of back-to-back Grand Slams, but Thursday's loss saw them drop to fifth in the world rankings and they have lost seven of their past nine against the teams above them.\n\nWith the four most recent of those reverses coming by double-digits, Thursday was no isolated incident. It is undeniable that a gap to the world's best has emerged and now widened.\n\nFarrell has always shown himself not to be one to throw the baby out with the bathwater but, whether it be seeking an injection of fresh blood, the heralding of a new direction or simply to prompt a reaction to their Parisian lack of \"intent\", it is clear he has some big selection calls to make before Thursday's team announcement to face the Azzurri.\n\nTo an extent, Farrell had already shaken up his team coming into this championship even when already without Andrew Porter, Tadhg Furlong, Mack Hansen, Hugo Keenan and Robbie Henshaw through injury, while Bundee Aki was suspended.\n\nJacob Stockdale was preferred to James Lowe while, with Tadhg Beirne selected in the second row, the selection of Cian Prendergast ostensibly came at the expense of the benched James Ryan.\n\nLeaving two British and Irish Lions out of the side would once have been viewed as a dramatic shift but the events of Thursday night mean that even some once seemingly cemented places in the side are up for fresh debate.\n\nDespite only playing half an hour at the Stade de France, back row Nick Timoney was arguably Ireland's most impactful player in Paris.\n\nThe Ulster back row's international career is perhaps indicative of how settled Ireland's team has become.\n\nHe made his debut against USA in the summer of 2021 but, before his subsequent role off the bench against France, his next five caps were spread across four and a half years and came against Argentina, as a match-day morning inclusion, Fiji, Georgia, Japan and Australia.\n\nAll through that period, he was consistently among the best and most consistent performers for his province and on Thursday gave the impression of a man who had been impatiently waiting for his first crack at the Six Nations and top-level international opposition.\n\nWhile capable of playing across the back row, it will be Josh van der Flier feeling the pressure at number seven.\n\nAlready 30, Timoney is only two years younger than the 2022 World Player of the Year, but with Van der Flier struggling for his best form this season, it would certainly be a selection for the here and now.\n\nThere is little doubt that Joe McCarthy has a long future in the Ireland engine room.\n\nJust 24 years old, he has a profile that is rare in Irish rugby, providing a real combination of physicality and athleticism in the second row. Indeed, having established himself as a starter only after the 2023 World Cup, he is among the most recent additions to Farrell's starting XV.\n\nHowever, as a penalty concession for coming in at the side straight in front of the posts and right in front of the referee on Thursday shows, his decision-making and discipline remain a major work-on.\n\nIt was only last year, after the reverse fixture in the Six Nations, that the Ireland camp were publicly talking about how the Leinster player would learn from his costly yellow card for pulling back Thomas Ramos.\n\nWhen Ireland were at their best, such transgressions were simply not tolerated.\n\nIn Munster's uncapped Edwin Edogbo, Farrell now has an alternative who could bring similar physical presence to the side and the 23-year-old has shown good form for his province since returning for injury too.\n\nPairing the two together feels like Ireland's future in the position, but Edogbo over McCarthy for Saturday would give the side's most exciting prospect an international bow and offer a reminder of the required standards in a side who have struggled with discipline this season.\n\nFive talking points from Six Nations opening round\n\nLike Van der Flier, Garry Ringrose is a player who has not found his best form after returning from the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia without a Test cap.\n\nThe Leinster centre was arguably the most unfortunate to miss out on facing the Wallabies, admirably self-reporting symptoms of concussion when he had been selected for the second Test.\n\nSo long a key defensive cog for Ireland, despite being at the centre of a debate on the value of missed tackles statistics, the 31-year-old was hardly alone in looking off the pace in Paris but midfield is definitely an area where the side would benefit from experimenting with younger options.\n\nRingrose, Stuart McCloskey, Henshaw, Aki and even the side's most recent debutant Tom Farrell, are all the wrong side of 30 with the next World Cup still one year and eight months away.\n\nJude Postlethwaite was not even in the senior squad until news broke of Aki's impending suspension but he certainly impressed earlier this season for Ulster.\n\nA run against Italy, alongside his provincial colleague McCloskey in midfield, would be an interesting test of his international credentials.\n\nWard rejoins Ireland squad as Furlong nears return\n\n'Scrutiny and pressure on Irish has reached new level'\n\nIreland must 'stop rot' after Paris humbling",

    "fullText": "Formula 1 design legend Adrian Newey says Aston Martin's new car is \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.\n\nNewey's comments came as Aston Martin launched their new season on Monday, in a lavish event in Saudi Arabia that was afflicted by technical problems and revealed only the colour scheme on a generic 2026 car, not the team's new design.\n\nThat was waiting across the King Fahd Causeway at the Bahrain International Circuit, where the second pre-season test begins on Wednesday.\n\nNewey, who joined Aston Martin as managing technical partner in March last year, told BBC Sport: \"It seems to be a bit different to some of the other solutions out there.\n\n\"A bit like 2022, there's a new set of aerodynamic regulations, there's been lots of different interpretations. Whether it's the right one or the wrong one, only time will tell.\"\n\nRivals have expressed admiration for the new Aston Martin, which tested in an all-black livery for just one of the permitted three days in the so-called 'shakedown' test in Spain last month.\n\nNewey admitted that the car was not painted there partly because it was ready so late that the team had not had time to do so.\n\nTeams were allowed to run for three of five days in a week at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, but the Aston Martin was ready in time to go out only late on the fourth afternoon, when it broke down after four laps with Lance Stroll at the wheel. Fernando Alonso then ran for just over 60 laps on the final day of the test.\n\nMercedes driver George Russell, the pre-season championship favourite, described it as \"pretty spectacular\" and said it was \"probably the most standout in terms of the car design and it looks very impressive\".\n\nWilliams team principal James Vowles said it was a \"really, really interesting design\".\n\nNewey, who has a reputation for usually being at the leading edge of innovation when new rules are introduced, said: \"Because of the very compressed design time, we decided on a direction, a single direction, that we would pursue. And that is what we've done.\"\n\nNewey joined a team that had already gone through a series of management changes in the past couple of years, while working to bring on stream a new factory, wind tunnel and driver-in-the-loop simulator.\n\nHe said the design process of this year's car, the team's first as Honda's engine partner, had been \"an incredibly compressed cycle\".\n\nHe added: \"Overall it's been very stimulating and invigorating, exhausting at times as well, of course. But what I found was a lot of individually very talented people who weren't necessarily working that well together.

    "description": "Sam Darnold leading the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl glory could just be the greatest redemption story ever in the NFL. We take a closer look.",
    "fullText": "The Sam Darnold redemption story is quite something - from being rated as one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL to Super Bowl champion.\n\nIt's a tale of never giving up, of character, unwavering self-belief and persistence, but also a warning for teams not to write a quarterback off too soon.\n\nAs youngsters being drafted into the NFL are at the mercy of circumstance, not every team will fit every rookie and the sport's history is littered with college stars deemed not good enough.\n\nThey often bounce around from team to team, as Darnold did, but never has one plumbed the depths before managing to rise up and claim the sport's ultimate prize in the ultimate NFL redemption story.\n\nSeahawks beat Patriots to win Super Bowl 60 with crushing defensive display - as it happened\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nSo how bad was Darnold? Well, the numbers were not great, as after being drafted in 2018 he spent three seasons with the New York Jets and two with the Carolina Panthers - during which time he ranked bottom or near the bottom in several areas.\n\nWins were the main one - just 21 of them in five seasons - but categories like passer rating and completion percentage were the worst of any quarterback during that time.\n\nAs a third pick in the draft he was ridiculed for his \"seeing ghosts\" comment as he struggled, and labelled a bust, but now he's getting fitted for a Super Bowl ring it's clear he was only part of the problem.\n\nFellow Jets quarterbacks Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith and Zach Wilson also all finished dead last in passer rating in their first three seasons with the team. Notice a theme?\n\nThat's a quirk of the NFL Draft system, the best players go to the worst teams, and while some could just be having an off season so can build for success, some have serious issues.\n\nAfter Sunday, Darnold has now won 39 games since leaving New York, including serving two years as a back-up - the Jets have won just 26.\n\nThe Panthers have won 15 to Darnold's 31 since leaving Carolina and even the Vikings and 49ers can't match his wins since he departed.\n\nPeople forget that at just 21 he was the youngest NFL starting quarterback since the 1970 merger - perhaps the young man was just in the wrong place after all.\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\n\"Quarterbacks need tonnes of help to allow you to go show how great you can be. If you do not get that help, you are limited in how great you can be,\" said former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and three-time Super Bowl champion Steve Young.\n\n\"And there are not 32 places in the league today that can give you that help.\"\n\nYoung knows when a team is not a good fit, as he was drafted by a poor Tampa Bay squad and won three games in two seasons before leaving to join the 49ers and eventually becoming a Hall of Fame member.\n\nIronically enough it was a largely forgotten season in San Francisco that also provided the catalyst for Darnold to launch the comeback of all comebacks.\n\n\"I didn't play great football the first few years of my career,\" Darnold admitted after the Super Bowl. \"Then I come here to San Francisco and I think because of that year I was able to learn a tonne. I was able to kind of learn and go to Minnesota and play good football there. I was able to come to Seattle and do the same.\"\n\nWorking in a fully functioning franchise, learning from coach Kyle Shanahan and serving as back-up to Brock Purdy in a Super Bowl saw Darnold head to Minnesota better equipped to succeed.\n\nThe irony of returning to Levi's Stadium for his crowning glory was not lost on him.\n\nA stellar season in Minnesota came after he replaced injured rookie JJ McCarthy, but then more irony in the Vikings opting to stick with the quarterback they drafted saw Darnold move on again.\n\nHe left after massive career highs of 14 wins, over 4,000 yards and 35 touchdowns, but still with question marks after a play-off capitulation against the Rams.\n\nOnce again, he had a point to prove.\n\nQuarterbacks grab all the headlines, for good or bad, but they simply cannot do it all by themselves in this ultimate team sport.\n\nTom Brady regularly had, and needed, a top-10 defence on his side to win Super Bowls, while Patrick Mahomes lost two of them because he was soundly beaten up by opposing defences.\n\nIn Seattle, Darnold found the perfect storm of a team on the up and a defensive head coach assembling a crack unit that would go on to dominate the NFL, needing just a solid quarterback to steer the offence.\n\nHaving the league's leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Super Bowl MVP running back Kenneth Walker also helped, and plenty will say Darnold did not have to do much.\n\nHe became the first quarterback to enjoy successive 14-win seasons with two different teams - only Brady had managed it with one - but still there were questions as he led the league in turnovers, giving the ball away 20 times.\n\nAround 80% of play-off games are won by teams with the fewest turnovers. In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nDarnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.\n\nThe response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.\n\nHe answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.\n\nWas it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.\n\nNo quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.\n\nLuck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.\n\nNone have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

This wildfire is crazy.\"\n\nShe then refused to rule out a comeback at the end of January, telling the Today Show: \"I don't know, I'm just going to see what happens.\"\n\nInterviewer Savannah Guthrie pushed Williams further, saying \"that's a maybe to me\", and the seven-time Wimbledon singles champion said: \"It's not a maybe.\"\n\nAsked whether she had re-entered the drug testing pool, Williams said: \"I don't know if I was out. Listen, I can't discuss this.\n\n\"If I want to put it [rumours] to bed... listen, I want to go to bed.\"\n\nWilliams previously spoke about using weight-loss drugs in August and appeared in a commercial for the drug during Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam singles champion has never liked the word retirement and instead said she was \"evolving away\" from the sport when she ended her career in New York.\n\nOnly Margaret Court and Novak Djokovic have won more Grand Slam singles titles than Williams.\n\nHer haul of seven Australian Open titles, three French Opens, seven Wimbledons and six US Opens is the most major singles titles by any woman in the Open era.\n\nShe and elder sister Venus, who is still active on the WTA Tour, won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles and three Olympic golds together.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it.\n\n\"While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets.\n\n\"Standing in the starting gate yesterday was an incredible feeling that I will never forget. Knowing I stood there having a chance to win was a victory in and of itself.\"\n\nVonn crashed in Switzerland in the final race before the Olympics nine days before competing in the downhill event in Italy.\n\nIn a media conference on Wednesday, she confirmed she had torn her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) but expressed determination to compete.\n\nThe two-time world champion says the torn ACL and her previous injuries, including a partial right knee replacement, \"had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever\".\n\nVonn's decision to race has led to widespread praise for her bravery but also criticism about the dangers and potential risk of permanent damage.\n\n\"It always was and always will be an incredibly dangerous sport.

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The Puerto Rican artist’s performance was a gleeful rebuke of Trump’s death cult and a celebration of life.\n\nThe past year in Stephen Miller’s America has been unbearably bleak. When masked thugs with “blanket immunity” kidnap 5-year-olds and murder nurses, it tends to darken the national mood. But international mega-star Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) took the stage during the Super Bowl halftime show and gave the best possible response to Miller’s dystopic dreams: a burst of unbridled joy and a dizzying celebration of love, labor, and the power of living our everyday lives despite hardships, all performed in a lyrical language that Miller, in every possible way, lacks the capacity to understand.\n\nPeople should view Bad Bunny’s singular performance as the second part of a political two-step aimed at the white-nativist heart of this racist regime. Part one was a week ago, when, after winning the Grammy for album of the year, Bad Bunny began his acceptance speech by saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say: ICE out!”—to rapturous cheers. It was an ingenious first step, teeing up the halftime show as a future instrument for broadcasting the anti-ICE fervor hitting red and blue states alike.\n\nThen came step two: bringing the technicolor beauty of Puerto Rican culture to the Super Bowl stage. In a time of monsters, Bad Bunny was posing an alternative world: a place where laborers are seen and celebrated, where hurricanes and their victims aren’t forgotten, and where community—not atomization—fuels society. In the swirl of his irrepressible music, sung only in Spanish, and an elaborate set design that conjured the Caribbean in rich and playful detail, Bad Bunny refused to step into our dismal world. Instead, he brought us into his.\n\nI saw the game in a bar, where the people watching around me initially seemed more interested in the halftime show because of the controversy around Bad Bunny’s selection as a performer—the prospect of his Spanish-only music had predictably enraged right-wingers and prompted them to launch a counter halftime show, which spectacularly failed. In 30 seconds, though, many were standing and dancing, everyone locked into every move on the stage. When Ricky Martin came out as a surprise guest, you could feel the room swoon. At the end, everyone rose in an actual ovation.\n\nThe performance was so dense with meaning that, during the fourth quarter, people around me turned to discussing what part of the show they connected with the most—and not only because that was more fun than debating whether the Patriots were going to punt again.\n\nFor me, the most powerful moment was when Bad Bunny name-checked, one after the other, every country in the Americas: a bold, delightfully unsubtle statement against white ethnocentrism and USA puffery. When Bad Bunny said during his Grammy speech, “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans,” the “we are Americans” part had rankled some in immigrant rights circles because it seemed to differentiate the foreign-born. Bad Bunny’s rapid-fire listing—which pointedly did not ignore Cuba or Venezuela—could be seen as a response to that, telling Trump’s cruel regime that “America” is more than just the United States; it’s a region that goes from the top of Canada to the southern tip of Chile. The United States is a part of a community of nations—though it hasn’t been acting like it, instead targeting fishing boats off the coasts of other members of this community and blasting them from the sky like some fascist Death Star.\n\nBad Bunny’s performance will launch a thousand term papers intent on decoding every last moment, including when he gave a Grammy to a young child who had been watching from a staged living room seemingly set in Puerto Rico. Such a scene was particularly resonant knowing that, earlier in January, a 5-year-old boy from Minnesota named Liam Ramos had been abducted from his school by ICE and sent to a Texas detention center. Immediately after the show, people began debating online whether the child on stage was Ramos himself. He wasn’t, but it speaks to how deftly Bad Bunny pulled off his two-step that masses of people thought so.\n\nIn response, of course, Trump had a racist temper tantrum. Perhaps he was offended by a billboard in the background—in English, for his benefit—that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.” For this cowardly regime, it’s now a political act just to acknowledge the cultural power of Puerto Rico, to speak a beautiful language, to sing, and to dance, and to live in peace.\n\nDuring this show of shows, it was difficult to not think about a more serious moment at a recent Bad Bunny concert in Chile. There, the artist led the crowd in a song by legendary Chilean folksinger Victor Jara, who was something like the Bob Dylan of Chile, and whose songs of protest were known around the world. Shortly after the 1973 coup, Augusto Pinochet’s thugs mutilated his guitar-playing hands before the dictator had him publicly executed. Perhaps Jara’s most famous song was “El Derecho de Vivir en la Paz.” Bad Bunny had the entire crowd singing this 60-year-old song. For those who don’t know what it means, the title translates to “The Right to Live in Peace.”\n\nOne of Pinochet’s early orders was to paint over the vibrant, revolutionary murals of Chile, covering them in gray. Bad Bunny’s performance was an act of protest against such repression. It was the revenge of the muralistas. And not a moment too soon.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Members of Congress have a constitutional duty to remove this gangster from office.\n\nBruce Springsteen used the first great protest song of 2026, his “Streets of Minneapolis,” to deliver a blistering condemnation of the violent assault that a strike force of 3,000 masked and armed agents of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has waged on Minnesota’s largest city. The American bard describes how, during the first weeks of January, Minneapolis became “a city aflame…’neath an occupier’s boots” and recounts that “there were bloody footprints where mercy should have stood and two left to die on snow-filled streets: Alex Pretti and Renee Good.” Springsteen was not merely mourning; he was calling out the Trump administration’s propagandistic distortion of the truth about Pretti, an intensive-­care nurse with the Department of Veterans Affairs, gunned down by Border Patrol agents on January 24, and Good, a poet and mother of three, shot in the head by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on January 7. And the Boss excoriated “Noem’s dirty lies.”\n\nThe lies told by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, including wildly unfounded assertions that Good and Pretti committed acts of “domestic terrorism,” have inspired widespread demands for accountability for the most dangerously dishonest of Donald Trump’s miserable cast of cabinet appointees. There is plenty of competition for the “worst of the worst” title in Trump’s cabinet. But Noem’s attempts to defend the indefensible, her personal and official scandals, her mismanagement, and above all her outrageous and propagandistic lies about Good and Pretti are not merely shameful. They are impeachable.\n\nMembers of Congress, no matter their political affiliation, must recognize a constitutional duty to remove this gangster from the position of public trust that she has so flagrantly abused. The will of the people is already clear. Trump and Noem thought they could intimidate the public into quiescence. But tens of thousands of Americans have filled the streets of Minneapolis and cities across the country to demand the abolition of ICE because they have chosen to believe their own eyes, as opposed to Noem’s lies.\n\nThe arguments against Noem are now so stark that even senior Republicans are making the case for her removal, with North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis raging against “the incompetence of the leader of the [Department of] Homeland Security,” adding, “She doesn’t know how to lead, how to de-escalate. She’s exposing ICE officers to dangerous situations; she’s exposing US citizens to deadly situations.” Even as Trump tried to distance himself from some of Noem’s most extreme statements and policies in late January, the president’s response to Tillis and to Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, another Republican who’s said the secretary should go, was to call the senators “losers” and announce that Noem would be staying because “she’s doing a very good job.”\n\nWith Trump digging in, it falls to members of Congress to act. Many Democrats have done just that, as part of the most significant accountability movement yet seen during the year of chaos that Trump and his noxious inner circle of aides, such as Stephen Miller, have unleashed. In addition to tentative calls from Republicans for Noem’s resignation or firing, a robust movement to impeach the cabinet secretary has attracted support from over 180 House Democrats as of February 2. Supporters of impeachment have rallied around a resolution sponsored by Representative Robin Kelly (D-IL) that indicts Noem for obstructing the congressional oversight of detention facilities operated by DHS; for “using her position for personal gain while inappropriately using taxpayer dollars”; for “using her position to circumvent the Federal contracting process and [funnel] Federal funds to her friends’ businesses”; and for “repeatedly [violating] the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and due process rights of American citizens by directing [ICE] to make widespread warrantless arrests, forgo due process, and use violence against United States citizens, lawful residents, and other individuals.”\n\nThe resolution notes that, in the case of Renee Good, “despite video showing the officer on the side of the vehicle while firing and the vehicle was moving away from the officer on the second and third shots, Kristi Lynn Arnold Noem is claiming publicly that the officer was in danger and in front of the vehicle when he fired.” That lie points to the most compelling argument for Noem’s removal: She is a determined propagandist who seeks to distort the truth, undermine investigations, and divide Americans. And all the evidence suggests that she intends to keep lying to the American people, the media, and Congress.\n\nNone of the House members who propose to impeach Noem are naïve. They know that the full constitutional promise of the impeachment power has been undermined by Senate Republicans who have refused to hold members of their own party—including Trump himself—to account. And they know that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will do everything in his power to thwart accountability for Trump and his appointees—just as he did during the fight over the release of files regarding the convicted child-sex offender and longtime Trump associate Jeffrey Epstein. But the anger over Noem’s reckless actions and scorching dishonesty has momentum, which could force congressional action in much the way that US Representatives Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) ultimately did in their fight for the release of the Epstein files.\n\nKhanna has emerged as an ardent supporter of Noem’s impeachment because “she’s presided over agents who are killing American citizens.” The California representative includes Noem’s impeachment on a list of steps that, he says, must be taken to rein in ICE and DHS. “Congress is not powerless. Democrats must unify around an actual agenda,” argues Khanna, who urges opposition to future DHS funding, a repeal of the multiyear $75 billion in funding for ICE that Congress approved last year, investigations and prosecutions of ICE agents who have broken the law, and a strategy to “tear down and replace ICE with an agency that has oversight.”\n\nTo that list, we would add formal action by Congress to bar ICE agents from interfering with the 2026 midterms.\n\nWe understand that some will ask why Noem’s impeachment should be a priority with so many threats to be addressed and so many other members of the Trump administration who merit removal (including Trump himself). Our answer is that this is an accountability movement that has gained traction, has the potential to attract at least some Republican support, and above all will send a message to the whole administration that, to quote Springsteen, “We’ll remember the names of those who died on the streets of Minneapolis”—and the lies that have been told about Renee Good, Alex Pretti, and all the others who have died on Kristi Noem’s watch.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.
