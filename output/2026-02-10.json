    "description": "Instead of building toward the regular season in spring training, players in the WBC will step right into a playoff atmosphere. \"It can derail some pitchers.\"",
    "fullText": "Come early March, a small, but mighty group of San Francisco Giants will disperse from camp in Scottsdale, Ariz., suit up in their home country's colors and gear up for the triennial World Baseball Classic.\n\nThe WBC is a two-week tournament played in Puerto Rico, Japan, Houston and Miami and jam-packed with playoff intensity. The 2023 tournament left viewers on a high when Shohei Ohtani struck out Team USA's Mike Trout swinging at a nasty breaking ball to seal Team Japan's title.\n\nThree years ago, former Giants Camilo Doval and Joc Pederson competed. This year, eight Giants big leaguers will participate as well as three coaches, two press officers, one minor league infielder, one minor league hitting coach and, perhaps most notably, one athletic trainer. They will represent 13 countries: USA, Great Britain, Puerto Rico, South Korea, Venezuela, Colombia, Israel, Italy, Brazil, Australia, Netherlands, Mexico and Nicaragua.\n\nSeveral Giants wll play leading roles for their teams, including Logan Webb for Team USA, Jung Hoo Lee for South Korea and Heliot Ramos for Puerto Rico. There are variables that come into play for the big leaguers participating as the Giants ramp up for the 2026 season with an entirely new coaching staff, hoping to push off from the .500 record that's entrapped them for the better part of this decade.\n\nThat Dave Groeschner - the Giants' longtime head athletic trainer, will lend his services to Team USA - alongside Webb comes as a huge relief to the Giants front office.\n\nGroeschner will be able to closely monitor Webb's condition and report back to the team's head honchos about their ace as the tournament progresses. The most important variable for all teams, including the Giants, will be to keep in touch with their players' progress for those two-ish weeks they'll be outside their purview. But Webb is of extra concern given his status at the top of the rotation and his workload over the last few seasons.\n\nPresident of baseball operations Buster Posey expressed clear concern about risks associated with the WBC, particularly with starting pitchers in their prime. Posey, who played in the 2017 WBC, said at the winter meetings that it's a \"great event,\" but thought it was better fit for pitchers in the later stage of their careers.\n\nClayton Kershaw, who retired after the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series title this fall, will pitch for the USA this March, for example. The decision to participate lies with the player, though, and Webb wants to play after having opted out in 2023.\n\nThere's high hopes for Team USA to make the semifinal round in Miami, which means Webb would get the full WBC experience. That means his ramp up, one he's had down to a science ready to be Opening Day starter four consecutive seasons, will have to be slightly modified.\n\nIn practice, that means the Giants will be in communications with USA manager Mark DeRosa - a member of San Francisco's 2010 World Series-winning team - about Webb's usage. Strict workload rules are already in place: In the pool round (Team USA will be in Houston for this round), no pitcher can throw more than 65 pitches in an outing. If Team USA makes the quarterfinals, which begin March 13, that number goes up to 80. And for the semifinals and championship, spanning March 15-17, the pitch count ticks up to 95.\n\nThe limitations generally comply with how a starting pitcher's ramp-up looks in spring, and tournament officials send data to MLB teams from their players' outings. But the Giants are most concerned about the atmosphere, how the high leverage, adrenaline-filled games might alter a month in which players are typically dedicated to pace and caution.\n\n\"We've also seen over the years that it can derail some pitchers, because there's no way to replicate getting yourself ready for, essentially, a playoff baseball atmosphere in early March,\" Posey said in December at the Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla.\n\nIn 2023, the New York Mets lost closer Edwin Diaz for the season when he tore his patellar tendon in a Puerto Rico victory celebration gone awry. Posey might also be thinking about Ryan Vogelsong, who pitched for the USA in 2013 and had a rocky start to his season weeks later - a 7.19 ERA in his first nine starts.\n\nThose scenarios are a bit less of a concern for non-starters, who may not be pitching in such high-leverage spots. More of a concern for the rest - Ramos, Lee, Tristan Beck, Luis Arráez, Reiver Sanmartin, Jose Butto, Harrrison Bader - will be the gap in acclimating with almost an entirely new coaching staff.\n\nAll the Giants' WBC players will be reporting back to rookie manager Tony Vitello and his new-look staff. Ramos, Lee, Bader and Arráez will report to hitting coaches Hunter Mense and Oscar Bernard about how their batting practices feel. Webb, Butto, Beck and Sanmartin will have more involved talks with new pitching coaches Justin Meccage, Frank Anderson, Jesse Chavez and Christian Wonders to update on their bullpen sessions.\n\nSpring training isn't the only runway for players to get to know their coaches. Many have been collaborating in Arizona all winter, well before Tuesday's pitchers and catchers reporting date (the coaches have been in their roles for months despite the official hiring announcement not coming out until last Friday).\n\nThis article originally published at Giants' Buster Posey casts a wary eye on adrenaline generated in WBC.",

    "fullText": "The highly anticipated men’s ice hockey tournament will kick off on Wednesday, but ahead of that, the women’s competition has already delivered some memorable moments, including standout performances from a pair of local Manitoban defenders representing Team Canada.\n\nWinnipeg native Kati Tabin and Ste. Anne’s Jocelyne Larocque have both played meaningful roles on Canada’s blue line, helping the defending champions open the tournament with two dominant victories. Canada began round-robin play with a convincing 4-0 shutout of Switzerland before following it up with a 5-1 win over Czechia on Monday.\n\nTabin has been used in more of a depth role through the opening games but has continued to make the most of her opportunities. In the tournament opener against Switzerland, she logged 9:53 of ice time and recorded two shots on goal. Her role expanded in the second game, as she saw her minutes climb to 13:42 against Czechia, though she was held without a shot.\n\nLarocque, meanwhile, has taken on a heavier workload and has been a steady presence on the back end. The veteran defenseman played 21:12 in Canada’s opening win, finishing the game with two shots on net while helping anchor the defensive effort. In the second game, her ice time dipped slightly to 17:17 as Tabin’s role increased, but Larocque remained an important part of Canada’s defensive rotation.\n\nANOTHER WIN IN THE BOOKS 🇨🇦\n\nTeam Canada improves to 2-0 following their win over Czechia at #MilanoCortina2026 👏 pic.twitter.com/QwHXUZLvZH\n\n— Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) February 9, 2026\n\nWith two wins already secured, Canada now turns its attention to the final game of the round robin, a highly anticipated matchup against its long-time rival, the United States. The Canadians and Americans will meet Tuesday afternoon at 1:10 p.m. EST, with the game airing on CBC, Sportsnet, and TSN.\n\nFor action-packed issues, access to the entire magazine archive and a free issue, com/free.

    "fullText": "San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Keion White was shot in the ankle during an event on Monday morning.\n\nWhite was shot at 4:06 a.m. on the 17th block of Mission Street in San Francisco, a San Francisco Police spokesman said, via The Athletic. There was an altercation between two groups that broke out at an event there that led to the shooting, though specifics of that incident are not yet known. White is not believed to have been part of that altercation, though he was shot in the ankle.\n\nHe was taken by police to a nearby hospital, and is expected to be OK.\n\n“Keion White was a victim of a shooting and sustained a bullet wound to his ankle this morning in San Francisco,\" the 49ers said in a statement. \"He is currently undergoing surgery at a local hospital. We will provide further updates when appropriate.”\n\nThe incident took place hours after the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium on the other side of the Bay Area. The stadium sits more than 40 miles away in Santa Clara, south of San Francisco. White was at the Super Bowl, and was spotted wearing a Patriots hat.\n\nWhite was traded to the 49ers in October from the Patriots, who selected him with the No. 46 overall pick in 2023. White had 18 total tackles and 1.5 sacks in 14 games this season. The 27-year-old has one year left on his initial four-year, $7.7 million deal. The 49ers went 12-5 this past season and reached the playoffs, though they were knocked out in the divisional round.\n\nWhite is now the second 49ers player to be shot in recent years. Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall was shot in the chest during an attempted robbery in San Francisco ahead of his rookie season in 2024. Pearsall ended up returning to play in 11 games during that season.",

    "fullText": "LANCASTER — It was a night of celebration on Feb. 6 as five new members were inducted into the Lancaster High School Gary Mauller Athletic Wall of Honor.\n\nThe induction ceremony occurred before the boys' varsity basketball game against Reynoldsburg at Lancaster High School.\n\nThe Wall of Honor is named after Gary Mauller, an educator in the Lancaster City Schools for 47 years, serving as athletic director from 1989 to 1996. He always believed it was important to honor tradition and recognize outstanding efforts by Lancaster athletes.\n\nMauller began hanging pictures on the hallway wall during his tenure as athletic director. Upon Mauller’s passing in April of 2017, donations in his memory have enabled the continuation of his mission to recognize Lancaster High School’s athletic tradition.\n\nMore: What a remarkable ride: My journey from the MV News mail room to the OPSMA Hall of Fame\n\nJacob Arter (Class of 2017): A three-year varsity starter, second-team OCC in 2015 and 2016, and first-team OCC in 2017.

    "fullText": "CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy — Lindsey Vonn sustained a “complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly” after her devastating crash in the Olympic downhill, the skier said in a social media post late Monday.\n\nVonn posted on Instagram about her left leg injuries following her fall in Sunday’s race.\n\n“While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets,” Vonn said.\n\nNine days before Sunday’s crash, the 41-year-old Vonn ruptured the ACL in her left knee. It is an injury that sidelines pro athletes for months, but ski racers have on occasion competed that way. She appeared stable in two downhill training runs at the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nOnlookers on social media wondered if Vonn’s ruptured ACL could have played a factor in her crash near the top of the Olympia delle Tofana course, where she has a World Cup record 12 wins. That maybe, on a healthy left knee, she would not have clipped a gate and been able to stave off a crash.\n\n“Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would,” Vonn said. “It wasn’t a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\n\n“I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever.”\n\nVonn’s father said Monday that the American superstar will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision.\n\n“She’s 41 years old and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.”\n\nWhen she arrived in Cortina last week, Vonn said she had consulted with her team of physicians and trainers before deciding to move ahead with racing. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation does not check on the injury statuses of athletes.\n\n“I firmly believe that this has to be decided by the individual athlete,” FIS president Johan Eliasch said Monday in Bormio. “And in her case, she certainly knows her injuries on her body better than anybody else. And if you look around here today with all the athletes, the athletes yesterday, every single athlete has a small injury of some kind.\n\n“What is also important for people to understand, that the accident that she had yesterday, she was incredibly unlucky. It was a one in a 1,000,” Eliasch added. “She got too close to the gate, and she got stuck when she was in the air in the gate and started rotating. No one can recover from that, unless you do a 360. … This is something which is part of ski racing. It’s a dangerous sport.”\n\nThe Italian hospital in Treviso where Vonn was being treated said late Sunday she had undergone surgery to repair a broken left leg. The U.S. Ski Team has said only that Vonn “sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.”\n\nPierre Ducrey, the sports director for the International Olympic Committee, noted Vonn was able to train and had experts counseling her decision.",

    "fullText": "Klint Kubiak is officially the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, agreeing on a five-year contract, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.\n\nLeadership in place. #RaiderNation \n\n— Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Raiders and Kubiak struck an agreement on February 1, the morning after his second interview with the team. However, the Raiders had to wait until after Sunday’s Super Bowl in which Kubiak served his final game as the Seattle Seahawks’ offensive coordinator in a 29-13 winning effort. Kubiak confirmed after the game he was headed to Las Vegas.\n\nThe Raiders focused on Kubiak because he was a young offensive mind who has never been a head coach. The Raiders interviewed more than a dozen candidates, but Kubiak was their focus.\n\nKubiak, who turns 39 on February 17, was the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator 2025 and was wildly successful. Previously, he served in the same position with the New Orleans Saints and coached former Raiders quarterback Derek Carr in 2024 and with the Minnesota Vikings in 2021. He has 12 seasons experience as an NFL coach.\n\nKubiak is the son of Denver Broncos Super Bowl-winning head coach Gary Kubiak and the brother of San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak, who also interviewed with the Raiders.\n\nReportedly, Raiders’ part owner Tom Brady, who helped lead the search, was a big fan of Klint Kubiak and he called several of the Seahawks’ games this season for Fox.\n\nNow, Brady and the Raiders hope Kubiak can led the offense, and likely new quarterback Fernando Mendoza into a new, winning era.",

    "fullText": "The big story over the weekend at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi was Lindsey Vonn’s crash in the women’s downhill on Sunday. For Vonn, her Olympic experience in Milan was not supposed to end this way after an iconic career that saw her be one of the best female alpine skiing speed racers of all-time. The crash was simply spectacular, and the 41-year-old Olympic gold medalist from Saint Paul, Minnesota was heard screaming on the course as she was lifted by helicopter.\n\nWith the injury to Vonn, will many sports fans remember who won the Olympic gold medal in the women’s downhill? It just so happened to be another American in Breezy Johnson of Jackson, Wyoming.\n\nInside look at Johnson’s Olympic gold\n\nJohnson posted a winning time of 1:36.10. Emma Aicher of Germany won the silver medal with a time of 1:36.14. Sofia Goggia of Italy won the bronze medal with a time of 1:36.69. Johnson reached the podium by 0.86 seconds over Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon, and Cornelia Hutter of Austria, as they both had a fourth place time of 1:36.96.\n\nAt age 30, this is the first Olympic gold medal for Johnson in her impressive skiing career. She previously won two gold medals at the Alpine Skiing World Championships in Saalbach, Austria. Johnson won gold in the women’s downhill, and gold in the women’s team combined with another American icon in women’s alpine skiing, Mikaela Shiffrin of Vail, Colorado. Due to the fact that Johnson has been a big performance skier in the past, the Olympic gold medal in Cortina should not have been much of a surprise–even to Snoop Dogg, who was watching the women’s downhill with Lindsey’s father.\n\nUSA has two gold medals to date\n\nJohnson’s gold medal is one of two medals for the United States so far. They also placed first in the team figure skating competition. The Americans beat Italy by a single point. The Americans were led by quad and backflip artist Ilia Malinin in the men’s event, and ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates in ice dance.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympics: Did the Lindsey Vonn crash overshadow Breezy Johnson’s Olympic gold? appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Editor's Note: This article is published in partnership with Read The Line, a Golf Digest content partner.",
    "fullText": "For the third consecutive year, the historic Pebble Beach Golf Links has been awarded Signature Event status as a star-studded field descends upon this iconic venue. The opening two rounds will feature a Pro-Am format, with all players in the 80-man field paired alongside celebrities while rotating between Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill.\n\nThe Signature Event designation means there will be no cut, allowing all 80 players to advance to the weekend for the final two rounds at Pebble Beach. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler headlines the best field to date this year, also highlighted by the 2026 PGA Tour debut of defending Pebble Beach champion Rory McIlroy.\n\nLet’s dive into my top 10 contenders to watch as the best in the world take center stage at the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.\n\nOne of the keys to unlocking low scores at Pebble Beach is dominating the par 5s, as evidenced by Rory McIlroy’s two eagles last year that propelled him to victory. Enter Jake Knapp, the current leader in par-5 scoring average over his past 40 rounds.\n\nKnapp has become a familiar name on Sunday leader boards this season, posting three T-11-or-better finishes in all of his 2026 starts. He’s unbothered by the pesky Poa annua greens, ranking fourth in the field from inside 15 feet on Poa. Bomb it far and putt it well, Knapp will look to deploy the McIlroy game plan this week at Pebble.\n\nA shorter golf course, difficult-to-hit greens and excellent course history: Russell Henley checks every box at Pebble Beach. Nearly half of the approach shots come from inside 150 yards, playing directly into the strengths of the world’s No. 6-ranked player.\n\nHenley boasts a remarkably high floor, producing top-20 finishes in each of his past 10 PGA Tour starts. Pebble is an ideal fit for his game, and a course where he gained +7.5 strokes with the putter in 2025, his best putting performance of the past two years.\n\nCue the “home game” narrative. Maverick McNealy grew up with a home just off Pebble Beach and considers this his favorite tournament of the year. His course familiarity is second to none, but it’s his trending form that earns him a spot among my top contenders.\n\nMcNealy has gained strokes on the field in all four major statistical categories in each of his three starts in 2026. His consistently strong approach play and tendency to spike with the putter give him real upside for anyone looking deeper down the odds board.\n\nSince the summer of 2024, only Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have more PGA Tour wins than Chris Gotterup. His rapid ascent continued with his second victory of 2026, making birdie on six of his final seven holes to win the WM Phoenix Open in a playoff.\n\nHe’s built for the moment, relishing opportunities to take down the game’s titans and proving he has the clutch gene. His dominance off the tee alone can carry him to victory. The sky is the limit for Gotterup, and this rocket ship shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.\n\nA T-3 finish at the WM Phoenix Open once again left Si Woo Kim backers empty-handed after he shared the lead for much of Sunday in Scottsdale. Still, the world-class ball-striking continues, and it feels like only a matter of time before the putts finally fall when it matters most.\n\nEventually, this hourglass of elite form will run out. Until then, Kim led the field tee to green last week and continues to put himself in contention regardless of course style or location. One of the tour’s most aggressive players, his moment is coming during this run.\n\nPebble Beach is often won on the back of precise, demanding approach play into the smallest greens on the PGA Tour, and that points directly to Viktor Hovland. He attacked the treacherous pin locations at TPC Scottsdale, firing a 9-under weekend to vault himself into a top-10 finish.\n\nHardcore golf fans will remember the 2018 U.S. Amateur, held at Pebble Beach and won by a free-spirited, immensely talented young Norwegian named Viktor Hovland. He looks well-suited to add another victory on the Pacific cliffs and reestablish himself among the world’s elite.\n\nTwenty-six years after making his professional debut, Justin Rose sits No. 3 in the world at age 45. It’s truly amazing. Rose captured his 13th PGA Tour title two weeks ago at Torrey Pines, surpassing $75 million in career earnings along the way.\n\nIt’s been an extraordinary career, and Rose remains a legitimate threat any time he tees it up. At this stage, he chooses his spots carefully, and Pebble Beach is always circled. A winner here in 2023, he’s more than capable of adding another trophy this week.\n\nIt’s been just over five months since Tommy Fleetwood’s last PGA Tour start, arguably the feel-good moment of the season, when he finally shed the monkey off his back by winning the 2025 Tour Championship.\n\nHe followed that up with another victory on the DP World Tour in October and enters 2026 primed for a run toward the top. Fleetwood’s elite wedge play on a shorter-than-average course gives him a real chance to neutralize the game’s biggest hitters at the top.\n\nPebble Beach. The Players. The Masters. The Irish Open. The Ryder Cup. 2025 was a dream season, the best of Rory McIlroy’s career, and it all started here. McIlroy dismantled Pebble Beach, overpowering it with driver and taking unimaginable lines over doglegs en route to a comfortable two-shot victory.\n\nHe returns to defend his title, making his PGA Tour season debut after eight consecutive DP World Tour starts. Does he have enough in the tank for another heavyweight battle with Scheffler in 2026? Like most golf fans, I can’t wait to find out.\n\nIn the opening round of the WM Phoenix Open, Scottie Scheffler finally looked human. He spotted the leader 10 shots through 18 holes and still nearly won the tournament. We saw his worst, and only two players in the 123-man field managed to beat him in the end.\n\nIf that doesn’t illustrate the massive gap between Scheffler and the rest of the PGA Tour, nothing does. He’s a deserving, prohibitive favorite once again, continuing his reign as the best player walking the planet. Scottie Scheffler sits atop my power rankings, and it isn’t particularly close.\n\nJoe Idone is a Read The Line contributor and host of the Preferred Lines podcast.",

    "fullText": "Former Detroit Lions defender Tracy Scroggins has died at the age of 56, his family announced Feb. 9.\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Tracy Scroggins,\" his family said in a statement provided to TMZ.\n\n\"Tracy was a devoted father, cherished family member, and loyal friend whose life was marked by remarkable strength and perseverance. While many knew him for his career as a professional football player in the NFL, those closest to him knew him as a kind-hearted and generous man who cared deeply for his family and friends.\"\n\nThe family also revealed in its announcement of Scroggins death that the 56-year-old had suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) during his post-playing career.\n\n\"Playing in the NFL gave Tracy the opportunity to pursue his lifelong dream and to rise from poverty,\" the statement read. \"However, unfortunately, the NFL was also ultimately the cause of his untimely demise. Tracy spent every moment of retirement courageously battling the devastating effects of CTE. While our hearts are heavy, we find comfort in knowing that he is finally at peace.\"\n\nScroggins was one of nearly 5,000 players to file concussion-related lawsuits against the NFL before the league's sweeping concussion settlement in 2015.\n\nScroggins filed an additional claim against the NFL in 2016. His lawyer at the time – Tim Howard – stating his client was suffering from symptoms consistent with CTE, which can only be diagnosed with a postmortem brain examination.\n\n\"He can't remember where he is or where he's going,\" Howard told USA TODAY Sports in 2016. \"He hasn't been able to hold a job over the last six years. Beyond memory issues, he suffers from depression and has angry outbursts.\"\n\nScroggins played 10 NFL seasons, all for the Lions, after being selected in the second round of the 1992 NFL Draft. The Tulsa product played 142 games and made 89 starts while playing both defensive end and linebacker.\n\nScroggins racked up 60.5 career sacks – good for the seventh-most in franchise history – and was named the 90th-greatest player in franchise history by Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press – a member of the USA TODAY Network – in 2019.\n\nScroggins told The Detroit News in 2016 that he \"doesn't have any regrets\" about his career – with one caveat.\n\n\"I think things happen, sometimes for a reason,\" Scroggins said. \"But if I had the knowledge that players today have, I think that probably my career would’ve been five years shorter than it was.\"\n\nThe Lions paid homage to Scroggins with a social media post shortly after his death was announced:\n\nWe join the NFL community in mourning the loss of Lions Legend Tracy Scroggins, who played his entire 10-year in Detroit (1992-2001). pic.twitter.com/TdLRRXAWhn\n\n— Detroit Lions (@Lions) February 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Former Detroit Lions star dies after battling CTE, family announces",

    "fullText": "Most seem to agree that the St. Louis Cardinals have had a very active and successful offseason, but how likely is it that they still might trade JoJo Romero? There are many questions including if, to who and when.\n\nAs of today, the St. Louis Cardinals are only days away from pitchers and catchers reporting to Spring Training in Jupiter, Florida. There are still rumblings that the trade winds haven’t stopped blowing yet as JoJo Romero is reportedly still being discussed with other teams. While I can’t confirm that anything is close, a trade of JoJo is still possible. The most recent reporting I can find about Romero’s status came from MLB Trade Rumors just a few days ago on February 6. They asked their audience if they believe the St. Louis Cardinals will complete another trade before opening day and nearly 66% said yes.\n\nThe teams that reportedly have expressed the most interest in JoJo Romero are the New York Yankees, the Seattle Mariners and the Baltimore Orioles also according to MLB Trade Rumors. I’ve also seen mock trades suggested from the Toronto Blue Jays, but cannot confirm if that interest is serious. I thought there was a chance we’d see JoJo moved along with Brendan Donovan when his trade to the Seattle Mariners happened, but the fact that it didn’t makes me think that Chaim Bloom may have a different timeline in mind for JoJo.\n\nI’m wondering now if the St. Louis Cardinals are going to try and position JoJo Romero as a closer and then move him at the trade deadline when that market might be hot. That’s a gamble, but it might be the frame of mind that Chaim Bloom and his team have now that the ramp up to the season gets closer. I am reminded of an interview that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch had with JoJo late last season about what he learned from former Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley. Could it be that the Cardinals will set up closer by committee with JoJo and Riley O’Brien sharing that role?\n\nDo you think that the St. Louis Cardinals will trade JoJo Romero? If the answer is yes, do you think it should happen before Opening Day or at the trade deadline? If no, why are you in favor of holding onto him? I think we’ll find out sooner rather than later of what the St. Louis Cardinals are thinking about the future of JoJo Romero whether he’s a prime trade opportunity now or a bigger trade chip as a closer near the deadline this summer.",

    "description": "Mbappé vs. the Officials, Abuse in the Stands, and a Young Back Line That Held Firm",
    "fullText": "Real Madrid trips to Mestalla are rarely straightforward, and while the 2–0 scoreline suggests control, plenty of drama unfolded away from the goals. From sideline tension involving Kylian Mbappé to ugly scenes in the stands and a remarkably youthful defensive performance, here are a few moments from Sunday night that flew under the radar.\n\nKylian Mbappé was visibly frustrated with the officiating, particularly over an offside decision late in the first half. According to footage broadcast by DAZN, the French forward confronted the fourth official as players were heading down the tunnel at halftime, demanding clarification.\n\nMbappé questioned how the play could possibly be offside and asked for an explanation. The official responded by saying the call was determined by the broadcast camera angle and suggested discussing it inside the stadium. Mbappé agreed, insisting he wanted clarity because the decision made no sense to him.\n\nHowever, the explanation never came. As players prepared to return for the second half, Mbappé once again approached the fourth official, clearly irritated that he had been brushed off. He complained that he had been asked to speak inside, only to be ignored entirely. Realizing the conversation was going nowhere, Mbappé turned to Eduardo Camavinga nearby and muttered his verdict on the refereeing crew, calling them “clowns.”\n\nMbappé: “How is that offside? I’m asking about my position.”\n\nRef: “Sorry, we’ll talk inside.”\n\nMbappé: “I don’t understand.”\n\nRef: “Come inside.”\n\nMbappé: “I’m inside, so why won’t you talk to me?”pic.twitter.com/BQlEYYbSuX\n\n— 10 (@Kylian) February 8, 2026\n\nAs has become increasingly common in recent visits to Mestalla, the tension wasn’t limited to the pitch. Movistar cameras captured an unsettling incident involving a Real Madrid supporter seated among Valencia fans during the second half.\n\nThe fan, wearing a Madrid scarf, was confronted by several local supporters. During the altercation, his scarf was taken from him and tossed into the air. When he climbed down to retrieve it, another Valencia fan aggressively snatched it away again, while others nearby appeared to scold the aggressor.\n\nThe situation escalated as the Madrid supporter was escorted away by police. From above, another individual leaned over the railing, attempted to strike him, and ultimately spat in his direction — all clearly visible on the broadcast.\n\nThis was not the only disturbing moment involving the crowd. Later in the match, when referee Alberola Rojas paused play so a spectator could receive medical attention, sections of the Mestalla crowd broke into chants of “Mbappé, son of a bitch,” further highlighting the toxic atmosphere.\n\nMbappé would have the final word on the night, though. On his first visit to Mestalla, after being kept quiet for much of the game, he sealed Madrid’s win with a late goal in stoppage time.\n\nLost amid the noise and controversy was one of the most impressive aspects of Madrid’s performance: a defense built almost entirely on youth.\n\nWith injuries piling up and several senior defenders unavailable or not fully fit, Raúl González Blanco and Álvaro Arbeloa (via squad circumstances) were forced into fielding an extraordinarily young back four. David Jiménez (21), Raúl Asensio (22), Dean Huijsen (20), and Álvaro Carreras (22) started together, giving the defense an average age of just over 21 years. All were Spanish, and all but Huijsen came through the club’s academy system.\n\nIt was a lineup more reminiscent of Castilla than a La Liga clash at Mestalla. With no Rüdiger, Alaba, Carvajal, Mendy, Militão, or Fran García available, Madrid’s defensive average age dipped below 22 — a staggering number for a league match of this magnitude.\n\nJimenez, Asencio, Huijsen, Carreras. Was this the youngest backline fielded by a team in La Liga this season? It has to be up there, if not the youngest based on average age.\n\n— Managing Madrid (@managingmadrid) February 10, 2026\n\nAnd yet, the young back line barely put a foot wrong. Valencia were largely kept at arm’s length, Thibaut Courtois enjoyed one of his quietest nights in recent memory, and Madrid walked away with a clean sheet from one of the league’s most hostile venues.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the result was impressive. Given the age of the players tasked with seeing it through, it was even more so.",

    "fullText": "So another NFL season has come and gone, ending last evening with the Super Bowl, which was won by the Seattle Seahawks. Seattle won the old school way, or the way I would prefer our very own Miami Dolphins to play. A stifling defense based on a solid pass rush and a solid secondary, and an offense with one of the better or best offensive lines and a back or two who can run it down your throat even when the opponent knows that you are going to run it down their throats.\n\nThe NFL is, if nothing else, a copycat league. There is more than one organization that saw the beatdown that the New England Patriots took last night and decided that they needed to do more of that, whichever part of the above they wanted to embrace and emulate. The run game didn’t destroy the Patriots, but it was enough to keep the offense moving, even if it ended in field goals more often than not.\n\nSam Darnold did make some plays, and some of those were very lucky not be picked, but after a while, you could tell that Seattle could feel it on defense and went into more of a play-it-safe mode overall. On the other side of the coin, Drake Maye was pestered all night, making him look more like the second-year player he is than the MVP runner-up that he also is. Maye had two touchdowns to Darnold’s one, but he also took seven sacks and threw two costly interceptions. Darnold threw no interceptions and took only one sack.\n\nAs a side note, the one highlight for the Patriots was Christian Gonzalez, who was the one player that seemed to keep the Pats somewhat in the game for more than a half. So now we have the dumb luck of facing that dude for the next several years twice a year.\n\nSo tonights Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nWhat did you, as a Miami Dolphins fan, see from last evening’s game and victory by the Seahawks that you hope the new front office and coaching staff employ in their own plan to rebuild this team to something that looks respectable? On the other side of things, what did you see Seattle do that you hope the Dolphins do not grasp onto in their own rebuild?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nGuerschon Yabusele never got on the same page with New York Knicks head coach Mike Brown.\n\nAs a result, Yabusele was traded at the deadline to the Chicago Bulls and has found success with a change of scenery.\n\nThat said, Yabusele had to amend his contract in order to facilitate the trade to Chicago.\n\nIn order to be moved, Yabusele voided the second-year of his two-year contract, worth $6 million.\n\nYabusele opened up recently about his decision to void the guaranteed money, expressing his love for the game as the biggest reason why.\n\n“We can always see the side of the money and talk about it, but at the end of the day the passion is more than just the money. It’s being out there, missing the feeling of being out there, offense, defense. Just competing at a high level because I’m a competitor first,” Yabusele said.\n\nThis is just another chapter in what has been an interesting career for the Frenchman. Yabusele was drafted by the Celtics in 2016 and spent two seasons with them before finding his way out of the NBA. He spent five seasons overseas before returning to the NBA last year, posting a breakout season with the Philadelphia 76ers that earned him his most recent Knicks' contract.\n\nSince being acquired, Yabusele has averaged nearly 30 minutes per game in two appearances with the Bulls and is in the starting lineup for Monday's game against the Nets.\n\nYabusele has already posted one double-double and is averaging 12.5 points with Chicago. He's also been impressive defensively, racking up two blocks and three steals in his first two appearances.\n\nThese numbers are much more efficient from his time in New York, where he averaged 2.7 points and 2.1 rebounds in 8.9 minutes per game.\n\nGiven his story, it'll be quite interesting to see if Yabusele's second half in Chicago is enough to earn him a contract for next season.\n\nCoby White feels 'wanted' by Charlotte after trade to Hornets\n\nTravis Scott screams after James Harden's Cavaliers debut\n\nNic Claxton reveals thoughts following Cam Thomas' release\n\nJJ Redick reveals thoughts on Luke Kennard-Gabe Vincent trade\n\nGuerschon Yabusele's Bulls performance proves Mike Brown didn't use him properly\n\nHornets make 26-year franchise history in win vs. Rockets",

    "fullText": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The Las Vegas Raiders made it official Monday by announcing Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak will be their next head coach.\n\nKubiak arrived in Las Vegas on Monday fresh off a 29-13 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday.\n\nAmong the questions facing Kubiak, who will be formally introduced Tuesday, as he takes over:\n\n— Who he will hire as his coordinators on offense and defense?\n\nIf Kubiak brings coaches with him from Seattle, he could consider quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko for offensive coordinator and Aden Durde on the defensive side. It obviously would be a promotion for Janocko, though Kubiak might call the plays. Durde is the Seahawks' DC, but he would have the opportunity to have full control of the defense, unlike in Seattle where coach Mike Macdonald calls plays on that side of the ball.\n\n— What to do about defensive end Maxx Crosby?\n\nTwo NFL reporters have said that the Raiders' star pass rusher wants out. He wasn't happy about being placed on injured reserve with two games left this past season and might not have the appetite for another rebuild attempt. Crosby said on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that no such talk came from him, but he also didn't deny he wanted out.\n\nThe Raiders could get a haul by trading the 28-year-old Crosby and perhaps even accelerate the rebuild. Dallas got two first-rounders and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark by shipping Micah Parsons to Green Bay.\n\n— How will he prepare for free agency and the draft?\n\nLas Vegas has the No. 1 pick and more than $91 million in salary cap space, according to overthecap.com, so the Raiders have the opportunity to greatly upgrade their roster. It's almost certain they will use that top pick on Fernando Mendoza, who won the Heisman Trophy and quarterbacked Indiana to the national championship.\n\nBut the Raiders will need to surround Mendoza with a lot more talent than is currently on the roster. Their top priorities likely will be improving the offensive line and finding a No. 1 wide receiver. The defense doesn't have a glaring weakness, but can use help throughout that side of the ball.\n\nKubiak, 38, confirmed during an on-field interview with NFL Network after the Seahawks won the Super Bowl on Sunday that he was heading to Las Vegas. Not that it was a surprise.\n\nKubiak and the Raiders began working toward finalizing an agreement more than a week ago for him to take the job, a person with knowledge of the discussions said at the time. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no contract was in place and no announcement could be made until after the Super Bowl in Santa Clara, California.\n\nHe'll be the third coach in three seasons for the Raiders and fifth full-time leader since they moved to Las Vegas in 2020. He succeeds Pete Carroll, who went 3-14 in one season in Las Vegas after a storied run with Seattle that included two Super Bowl appearances and one championship.\n\nThe Raiders have been searching for a path back to their glory days. Three Lombardi Trophies sit in the team’s facility, but the Raiders haven’t won a playoff game since their last Super Bowl appearance in the 2002 season. They have made the postseason just twice since, most recently in the 2021 season.\n\nKubiak oversaw a Seahawks offense that went from being ranked 18th the year before in scoring to third in the NFL this season and from 14th to eighth in yardage.\n\nHis work with quarterback Sam Darnold was particularly notable. Darnold completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions this season. Drafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold had been considered a bust until leading Minnesota to a 14-win season in 2024. But the Vikings moved on from Darnold, and he proved that season was no fluke, winning 14 games in the regular season with Seattle and three \n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "title": "Time is running out to get a WNBA deal done",
    "description": "The WNBA season is scheduled to start in three months, but there is still no contract between players and the league.",
    "fullText": "After meeting face-to-face a week ago, it seems the WNBA and the players are back to negotiating. It was reported that after the players submitted a CBA proposal to the league in December, the WNBA still hadn’t responded to it in February. The sides met in person in New York last week, with over 40 players attending in person or over Zoom. At that meeting, the league still did not have a response ready for them, but submitted their latest proposal later in the week, on Friday.\n\nWhile the league did not budge much on the matters of money — particularly on revenue sharing models — they have appeared to concede a few things to the players. After wanting to take away housing benefits in the league completely, this newest proposal from the league now has housing covered for players with under three years of WNBA service. Players will be entitled to a one-bedroom apartment for the first three years of their WNBA careers, with new developmental players being offered a studio apartment.\n\nBreanna Stewart told Jack Maloney of CBS Sports at Unrivaled this week that the WNBA conceding on a few of those smaller points was important, and that it “means that the league heard us on things that matter to us,” she said.\n\nYet, this proposal ultimately will not be accepted by the players, mostly because the league still isn’t offering enough when it comes to revenue-sharing percentage. According to Maloney’s report, there is still a huge gap between the sides on this topic — the players want 30% of gross revenue to be given back to them, resulting in a team salary cap aboove $10 million per year and a max individual player salary of about $2.5 million. The WNBA is still only offering about half of that.\n\nTime continues to tick on the clock to get a deal done, though. The WNBA season is scheduled to start in exactly three months. Training camp usually starts about 2-3 weeks before that, with the WNBA Draft happening a week before camp kicks off. That’s a month right there. There are over 100 free agents who need to negotiate and sign new individual player contracts, setting the league up for an unprecedented free agency period in extremely limited time.\n\nPlus, with two new expansion teams in Toronto and Portland being added to the league this year, an expansion draft also still needs to happen. With no CBA in place, there are no rules on what the expansion draft will look like, and therefore, Toronto and Portland have been unable to fully prepare for that draft. Whenever a new CBA does get signed, existing WNBA teams will need to take time to prepare their protected player lists under whatever new rules are going to be in place, and then the expansion teams will need to receive those lists and prepare accordingly. It’s not something that can happen in just the span of a few days.\n\nAll of this to say, we are starting to cut it close. The players can feel it, as Stewart expressed in the interview with CBS. There is only so much time to negotiate before the start of the season will need to be pushed back. There isn’t a hard date being publicly discussed right now, but the overwhelming belief in my conversations with people around the league is that if something doesn’t happen before February is over, the start of the season could be affected.\n\nSo far, there is no serious talk about the players planning a strike. The union voted to authorize their executive committee to initiate a strike back in December, with 98% of the union voting yes. For now, though, it seems like both sides are at least making token efforts in the hope it doesn’t get to that point.",

    "fullText": "Suwon Bluewings begin another season in a division they still feel they do not belong in — but one that recent failures suggest they do. After two unsuccessful promotion attempts, the club has turned to Lee Jung-hyo to end the nightmare. Can he restore Suwon to their rightful place, or are the Bluewings becoming a K League 2 fixture?\n\n*Defeated 3-0 by Jeju SK on aggregate in the playoffs.\n\nThe consequences of Suwon’s failure to earn promotion back to K League 1 for a second straight season have been severe. Gone are the general manager, the entire backroom staff — including first-team manager Byun Seung-hwan — and a host of senior players, including Lee Ki-jae.\n\nLee Ki-jae during happier times.\n\nSuwon invested heavily in their squad last winter, recruiting players in virtually every position. However, a terrible start — four points from the first four games — immediately put the club on the back foot. They never recovered sufficiently.\n\nOne of the major weaknesses in the Suwon squad over recent seasons had been their attack. A lack of goals cost the Bluewings their K League 1 status in 2023 and contributed to their dismal sixth-place finish last year. Byun completely overhauled his attacking options, bringing in proven talent — and it worked. Stanislav Iljutcenko, Matheus Serafim, and Kim Ji-hyeon combined for 38 goals as Suwon finished the campaign with an eye-watering total of 76.\n\nUnfortunately, as one gaping hole was repaired, another emerged. The Bluewings were torn apart at the back, conceding 50 goals in 39 matches, and three more against Jeju in the playoffs. These numbers are unsustainable, and what is most frustrating is that over the course of the 39-match regular season, Suwon never rectified the issue. This was compounded by the fact that Suwon fell behind in 19 of their 42 total matches. Only three times did they recover to win. Teams do not earn promotion with such glaring deficiencies.\n\nThe 50-year-old is not a new signing for the club, but the acquisition of the former Gwangju manager is arguably the biggest decision Suwon have made in years. Lee arrives with a stellar reputation as one of the most forward-thinking Korean managers on the circuit.\n\nWill Reis be celebrating for Suwon this season?\n\nWhen Lee signed, the question immediately became: which former Gwangju players would he bring with him? If you conducted a snap poll of Suwon supporters, the name Isnairo Reis Silva Morais would rank highly. The 33-year-old forward scored 10 goals in 32 matches last season and has previously played — and dominated — K League 2.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old goalkeeper Kim Joon-hong joins on a season-long loan from MLS side DC United. Kim arrived in the United States as DC’s first-choice goalkeeper, starting the opening seven matches. Results did not go his way, with the former Jeonbuk youngster conceding 12 goals in three matches before being dropped. DC United were dreadful overall, winning just five matches and finishing with the worst record in the league. Kim will be looking to rebuild his form and confidence at Big Bird. The talent is unquestionably there.\n\nThe saddest aspect of Lee Ki-jae’s departure is not just that his final match ended in defeat, but that it concluded with a scandalous red card. It brought an end to a seven-year association with the Bluewings, during which he earned international caps. Last season, he scored three goals and provided seven assists as Suwon’s first-choice left back. Now, Lee plies his trade in Iran.\n\nPark Hyun-bin will add some much needed steel to Suwon's central midfield.\n\nOther players have arrived with a higher profile under the Lee Jung-hyo revolution, but none will fill such a glaring hole in the lineup as former Bucheon FC midfielder Park Hyun-bin. The combative 22-year-old is exactly what Suwon have lacked for several seasons: a tough, uncompromising, ball-winning central midfielder who finally adds steel to the engine room.\n\nReis and Fessin will supply goals, but Suwon were not short of them last year. What they have craved for some time is a shield protecting their surprisingly fragile defence. Park opted against promotion with Bucheon — where he would have been a guaranteed K League 1 starter — suggesting Suwon made a compelling offer to a potential future Korean international.\n\nIt may sound strange to say this, but 20-year-old right back Lee Geon-hee might not start the season as Suwon’s first-choice option. He fought off competition from experienced former Incheon United defender Jeong Dong-yoon to make 27 appearances in an unstable back line last season.\n\nLee did enough to earn call-ups to the Korea U23 side, and supporters likely felt he still had room to grow. The club’s signing of Gyeongnam FC right back Lee Jun-jae has added depth to the position. Lee Geon-hee was less culpable than most of his senior defensive partners for Suwon’s defensive failures and offered a genuine threat marauding down the right flank.\n\nIs Lee Jung-hyo the man to awaken the giant?\n\nSuwon Bluewings stand on the precipice of becoming a K League 2 staple. This season marks their third year in Korea’s second division — an unthinkable scenario when relegation struck in 2023.\n\nThey responded to the failure to secure an immediate return by investing heavily in an attack that had malfunctioned for years. It still wasn’t enough. Concerns that financial backing would be scaled back have, however, proved unfounded.\n\nSecuring Lee Jung-hyo on a five-year deal was the coup of the winter. The former Busan player came agonisingly close to delivering Gwangju their first major silverware in December and soon after guided the club to the ACL Elite quarter-finals. Now, he is preparing for trips to Paju Frontier and Ansan Greeners.\n\nSuwon have placed all their eggs in this — admittedly impressive — basket. Lee is the best manager in Korea. He has a strong squad and incredible support behind him. If he cannot deliver promotion, it is difficult to imagine who can.\n\nEverything fun about Suwon Samsung Bluewings happens off the pitch — unless you are a rival supporter. The club averaged 12,048 spectators in 2025, their highest figure in a decade. Big Bird is a stunning stadium, and attending a match there remains one of the best football experiences in Korea.\n\nThe Big Bird atmosphere is one of Korea's best.\n\nDespite recent disappointments, those attendance figures are unlikely to dip, largely due to the excitement surrounding Lee Jung-hyo’s arrival. If the former Gwangju manager can get a tune out of his band, this could be a fascinating season to watch unfold.",

    "fullText": "While the Houston Texans sat at home watching as the Seattle Seahawks bested the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, players from H-Town could at least watch former players try to win a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nLast season, the Texans traded a haul to the Buffalo Bills for Pro Bowl wideout Stefon Diggs. He only played in eight games before a torn ACL sent him to the injured reserve, but he seemed to be well respected among those in the locker room.\n\nWhile he impressed during the regular season as Drake Maye's No. 1 weapon, Diggs struggled to make an impact in the passing game during his first Super Bowl appearance, totaling three catches for 37 yards, including a 26-yard reception late in the fourth quarter to set up a Maye touchdown pass.\n\nOutside of Diggs, no other former Texans player offered much in a 29-13 finish. Here's how every former Houston player performed in the big game out west.\n\nOutside of a few starts during the regular season, Jones, who played with the Texans in the 2023, mostly served as a backup role in the playoffs and only saw action in two snaps in his first Super Bowl appearance.\n\nAkers, a surprise addition to the active roster in 2024 and even started for the Texans with Joe Mixon sidelined, was elevated from Seattle's practice squad for the NFC championship game and Super Bowl in place of the injured Zach Charbonnet. He didn’t record a carry but did get to see the field on special teams.\n\nSaubert, who briefly spent time on the Texans' roster in 2023, totaled four catches for Seattle during the regular season and didn’t see much action in the Super Bowl. He did see action on special teams, mostly kickoffs, field goals and PATs, which was key for kicker Jason Myers in the team's victory.\n\nAustin, a member of the Texans' 2023 practice squad, did see some action on both defense and special teams later in the game. He did not record a stat in his limited reps.\n\nGriffin barely spent a season with the Texans as a part-time starter in 2023, but he's bounced around the league since being drafted in 2017 by Seattle out of Central Florida. Signing back with the franchise this offseason, Griffin didn’t earn an elevation from the team's practice squad in the playoffs and watched from the sidelines as his franchise finally hoisted a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nIf this marks the end of his career, at least he can say he earned a ring.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: How did every former Texans player perform in Super Bowl LX?",

    "description": "Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum suffered an Achilles tendon tear May 12 during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Here's the latest update.",
    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics just made an announcement their fans have been eager to hear.\n\nThe franchise said star forward Jayson Tatum, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in May, was assigned to participate in portions of a G League practice Monday, Feb. 9. Following that session, the Celtics will recall Tatum, where he’ll continue his rehab with the team.\n\nThe Celtics said they would issue future updates when appropriate.\n\nTatum, 27, had suffered the injury during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Knicks, but has remained a steady presence around the team through its first 53 games of the season.\n\nThe announcement doesn’t necessarily mean Tatum will return to game action imminently, but it does carry significant implications.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Jayson Tatum’s recovery from his Achilles tendon rupture:\n\nDoes this mean Tatum will absolutely return at some point during the 2025-26 season? Not necessarily. Is it a positive sign? Yes, overwhelmingly so.\n\nAchilles tendon ruptures are complicated injuries that require calculated and arduous rehabs. That Tatum has progressed to the point of limited participation in practice signals that he has advanced to a certain level of competence.\n\nIn September, Tatum told USA TODAY Sports that he hadn’t fully ruled out a return to the court for the 2025-26 season, so this aggressive timeline indicates that Tatum and the Celtics may be considering a pathway toward a return.\n\nTo be sure: the practices will be controlled and the franchise will push Tatum only as far as he’s able. And even then, they will exercise prudence and will closely monitor how he responds to the sessions.\n\nBut, if Tatum is to return this season, he’d eventually need to return to practice and a return this soon should build optimism.\n\nStill, there will be plenty of work left to do for Tatum, and the most challenging part of his recovery will almost certainly be mental. After extended absences, players often feel the need to be tentative or cautious out of fear of reaggravating the injury. Tatum may face similar concerns, and he may even feel he’s lost some explosion or speed.\n\nBut even though Achilles ruptures used to be considered career-ending injuries, modern medicine has allowed plenty of players to return to full health and participation after suffering them.\n\nBoston has surpassed expectations and is 34-19, which is currently third in the East. If Tatum is cleared and able to return, he would instantly add a massive boost of scoring, playmaking and rebounding for the Celtics.\n\nIt would also make the Celtics a real threat to win the Eastern Conference\n\nLast season, Tatum averaged 26.8 points, 8.7 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jayson Tatum injury update: Latest on Celtics star",

    "fullText": "The national high school boys basketball 2025-26 season is entering postseason mode as many states begin the playoff portion of their campaign.\n\nThe latest set of Top 25 National high school boys basketball rankings is a new No. 1 in Sierra Canyon (Calif.) as they edge out SPIRE Academy (OH). What other programs should be are under consideration as among the top high school boys basketball squads in the land in our tenth set of rankings?\n\nNational high school boys basketball teams now eye the road to the state playoffs and mythical national championship as the 2025-26 season starts heading down that path into the February.\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory as of Feb. 9.\n\nSince losing to Bishop McNamara back on Dec. 6, the Sierra Canyon Trailblazers (22-1) have been on a roll, winning 16 straight games and are the hottest high school boys basketball team currently. Sierra Canyon is as good as they come in the country as they feature 5-Star+ Brandon McCoy at combo guard along with 2027 four-star small forward Maximo Adams (North Carolina commitment). After the Hoophall Classic, the Trailblazers returned back to the Golden State and defeated one of the state’s best teams in Harvard-Westlake, 55-47. Sierra Canyon’s most recent win was a 103-74 rout of Loyola last week as they collected win No. 22 on the season.\n\nEasily considered one of the best high school boys basketball teams in the country is SPIRE Academy (18-2), under the direction of the one of the best coaches in the country in Kevin Boyle, drops down from No. 1 for the first time in nearly a month. SPIRE Academy has one of the top rosters in the entire country as they feature the likes of four-star combo guard King Gibson and four-star small forward Alex Constanza (Georgetown commit). SPIRE Academy looks to bounce back after a loss to nationally ranked Montverde Academy (Fla.) and the next time they’ll likely get to do that is on Feb. 21 versus Long Island Lutheran (NY).\n\nDynamic Prep (13-1) are led by former NBA star forward Jermaine O’Neal and are one of the premier destinations for top prep boys basketball programs and top prospects. Last week Dynamic Prep took on nationally ranked Prolific Prep (Fla.), defeating The Crew, 78-66. The team features several of the country’s top players in 2027 four-star small forward Marcus Spears Jr. and 2026 four-star shooting guard Dakari Spear, who this past summer with Drive Nation on the EYBL Circuit, averaged 13.6 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game. Dynamic Prep have picked up impressive wins throughout the season with impressive victories against No. 7 Columbus, No. 10 Montverde Academy and a very good Zephyrhills Christian Academy team, respectively.\n\nPaul VI Catholic Panthers (22-2) gets out of the fifth spot and moves up a notch in our latest set of Top 25 rankings. This team has played well all season long behind the ultra-competitive play of 2026 five-star shooting guard Jordan Smith Jr. as they have won 23 games through 25 appearances. The Panthers have been very impressive as among the twenty wins are highlighted victories over teams like Archbishop Stepinac (N.Y.), Father Judge (Pa.) and Calvary Christian Academy (Fla.), respectively. Leading the way out of the backcourt for the Panthers is Smith Jr. and 2027 three-star combo guard Troy Tomlin. Lone losses of the season thus far for Paul VI Catholic came against Prolific Prep and Calvary Christian Academy.\n\nThe Indiana high school boys basketball season has seen the Fishers Tigers (20-0) look every bit of being the best team in the Hoosier State so far through 20 games. Wins have come over Ben Davis, Mt Vernon,  Noblesville, Terre Haute North Vigo and Tech thus far as Fishers starts to head into the tougher portion of their regular season schedule in the early going. The Tigers will be tested in the coming days and weeks in contests versus state-ranked Crown Point and Hamilton Southeastern. Leading the way for Fishers is that of combo guards Carsen Eloms (Wisconsin commit) and Gage Sturgill. Fishers will be tested in the coming days versus Penn and Westfield, respectively.\n\n6. Link Academy (MO) (16-2)\n7. Montverde Academy (Fla.) (15-4)\n8. Prolific Prep (Fla.)

    "description": "All the explanation in the world is worth less than a tenth of the solution, but we’re stuck with the former for now.",
    "fullText": "After coughing up a stoppage time equalizer to Torino on Saturday, Fiorentina’s emotional state is somewhere between crumbling and smoldering. It had looked as if the Viola were going to record their first comeback win of the Serie A season; they’ve conceded first in 13 of 24 league matches in this year, taking a total of 5 points from them. That’s left manager Paolo Vanoli and his squad facing what feels like their 15th consecutive inquest.\n\nI’m just as frustrated as everyone about Fiorentina’s inability to hang on in the dying minutes of a game, not least because this equalizer was so predictable that even I saw it coming. As I often do when I’m sad, I decided to suck as many of the emotions out of my head as possible and turned to the pure, cold realm of numbers, hoping to throttle my sadness with math like a healthy person does. Long story short, I made myself a little table.\n\nI started out wondering if Fiorentina’s conceded more late goals (final 10 minutes and stoppage time) of any team in Serie A this year, but I quickly realized how limited that approach was because it ignored everything else. I decided to include the number of goals teams had scored as well as conceded, as the net value felt more important.\n\nI also decided figure out the rate at which teams conceded late goals. Dividing a 90 minute game into 6 10-minute periods made the most sense. You’d expect teams to concede about 16.67% of their goals in each 10-minute period. Anyways, I grabbed my data and went to my trusty visualizing website. The table’s sortable by any column if you want to play around with it.\n\nMuch to my astonishment, I discovered that Fiorentina isn’t the worst team in Serie A at the end of games by any measure. Hellas Verona and Pisa have both conceded 10 goals in the final 10 minutes, while Fiorentina sits at “just” 9. The percentage of total goals conceded late pulled me up short: the Viola are only 5th-worst, with Verona and Pisa below them, as well as high-flying Roma and Inter Milan? What? That’s wacky.\n\nThe attacking numbers were equally anemic for Vanoli’s boys: just 3 goals scored in the last 10 minutes of games, comprising 11.11% of the total goals conceded. In a truly bizarre statistical quirk, that’s the same as Sassuolo and Udinese while also being considerably higher than both Verona and Roma. Inter, by the way, is blowing everyone else away in late goals, turning this apparent weakness into a strength. In short, the Mastini are for sure the worst late-game team in Serie A, with Fiorentina, Pisa, and Roma jostling for the other two spots on the podium.\n\nOkay, so we’ve determined that Fiorentina isn’t Serie A’s worst late-game team. Let the joy be unconfined, et cetera. The performance in crunch time, though, is obviously a concern and is one of several culprits for the Viola swoon into the relegation places. We’ve got the numbers here to contextualize how dire the situation is but they, like the stars, offer us no solutions.\n\nMuch of it comes down to that squishiest of hard facts: late-game mindset. Against Torino, Fiorentina dominated the second half, scored twice to overturn an undeserved first half deficit, and seemed to be cruising. The only shot the Granata mustered from minutes 46-80 was Saul Coco’s speculative blast from 30-odd yards. Clearly the Viola defense had bottled up the visitors: Torino had 3 touches in the Viola penalty area and none were threatening.\n\nRight around the 80 minute mark, though, Vanoli lost his nerve. He knew that Marco Baroni’s guys, seeing every opportunity to get something from a fragile opponent, would throw everything forward, and the Viola mister wasn’t sure his guys could weather the storm. To help, he brought on Luca Ranieri for Manor Solomon, adding an out-of-form defender for the winger who’d scored one of Fiorentina’s goals and had a hand in the other. Roberto Piccoli also replaced Moise Kean.\n\nIt’s obviously much easier to say this in hindsight but that was a massive error for three reasons. First, Torino no longer had to worry about Solomon and Kean’s pace. That allowed everyone to move up the pitch, safe in the knowledge that there was no counterattack coming. Indeed, Piccoli did some great work late on in beating 2 defenders and getting down the wing but there was nobody with him by the time he reached the end line and it went for a Torino goal kick.\n\nThe second reason was relational. Having defended with a back 4 for 80 minutes and done it quite well (aside from the opening goal), introducing Ranieri to create a back 5 threw everyone off. Torino easily overloaded the wings, forcing Fiorentina’s midfield 3 to shuffle back and forth across the pitch. That eventually created creases like the one Zakaria Aboukhlal found in stoppage time. Sure, Comuzzo shouldn’t have fouled him. But the Moroccan also shouldn’t have had half the pitch to himself and the Ginger Prince, uncertain about the covering defense, opted to bring him down rather than give him a free run.\n\nFinally, Vanoli’s substitutions told his players that they weren’t on the front foot anymore. Fiorentina’s got the mental and emotional strength of a clinically-depressed rutabaga so seeing the team brimming with confidence en route to retaking the lead was a welcome change. That mindset led to a strong second half performance. By dropping deep, the mister essentially told his players, “I don’t believe that you can keep this up so we’ve got to hang on by our fingernails instead.” Confidence isn’t quantifiable but, for a group like this, anything that could damage it has to be weighed carefully.\n\nIt’s easy to fall into the post hoc facto rationalizations, of course. Vanoli’s a smart coach and understands the game and this roster better than any of us. If Torino hadn’t scored, we’d be applauding his sensible parking of the bus. Alternatively, if he hadn’t changed anything and Torino had still equalized, we’d be fuming about his failure to react to the scoreboard in the final moments.\n\nThis is also an overreaction based on a single outcome. The Torino result was uniquely psychically damaging for a number of reasons, not least because it resulted in the 6th and 7th points lost to late goals over the past 10 league outings. To me, the difference is in perceived strength of the opponent. Fiorentina is terrible and Milan isn’t, so losing that game is irritating but also feels like justice. Losing to Hellas Verona, the worst late-game team in Serie A, is an act of god from which nobody is safe.\n\nTorino, though, is historically a club more or less on par with Fiorentina: not big enough to consistently trouble the Champions League places but too good to accept mid-table anonymity. Getting punked by your betters or ambushed by your inferiors stings but not as much as messing up against an equal. That’s the sort of result that forces you to take a long look in the mirror and reassess who you are.",

    "fullText": "Winning a Super Bowl is the highest mark of success for an NFL head coach. Only a small group of active coaches can say they have done it. Some built long careers around steady success. Others reached the top early in their coaching journey. Each of these coaches shaped their teams in a different way. Their titles show strong leadership, smart planning, and the ability to win on the biggest stage. Here is a look at the active Super Bowl-winning head coaches.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LX)\n\nMike Macdonald is the newest coach to join this list. He led the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl LX win in 2026. Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to earn its second title in franchise history.\n\nHis defensive game plan was the key to the victory. Seattle’s defense controlled the Patriots’ offense from start to finish. Pressure came from all angles and forced mistakes.\n\nThat championship made Macdonald one of the youngest head coaches to win a Super Bowl. The win also proved his defensive style can work at the highest level. Seattle now looks to build around that success for future seasons.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLVII with Baltimore Ravens)\n\nJohn Harbaugh won his Super Bowl with the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII. That victory helped define his long career in Baltimore. He became known as a coach who could win with strong defense and smart special teams play.\n\nHis teams stayed competitive through many roster changes. New players came in and old stars moved on. Success continued because Harbaugh adjusted his approach to fit his personnel.\n\nHowever, following a disappointing 2025 regular season, Harbaugh was fired from Balti\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLIV)\n\nSean Payton earned his Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. His offense stood out for its creativity and balance. Play calling became a major part of his reputation.\n\nLater, he moved to the Denver Broncos to begin a new chapter. Experience gives him an edge in building a culture of discipline and preparation.\n\nOffensive ideas from Payton influenced many coaches around the league. His teams often play with speed and confidence. Denver now relies on that knowledge to return to championship form.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LVI)\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a title in Super Bowl LVI. He became known for modern offensive design and clear communication with his players.\n\nYouth never slowed him down. Playoff runs became common under his leadership. Los Angeles stayed competitive in a tough division because of his planning and play structure.\n\nEach season shows his ability to adapt. Changes at quarterback and defense never stopped his teams from finding ways to win. Many see him as one of the smartest minds in football today.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LIX)\n\nNick Sirianni reached the top with the Eagles during a time when offense ruled the league. His coaching focused on balance and teamwork.\n\nRoster development became one of his strengths. Young players improved quickly under his system. Veterans also fit well into his plans.\n\nPhiladelphia built a strong identity with him in charge. Toughness and energy defined the team’s style. A Bowl win confirmed his place among the league’s top young coaches.\n\nAndy Reid leads this list with three Super Bowl titles. His record shows long-term excellence and steady results. Kansas City became a powerhouse under his leadership.\n\nOffensive creativity sets him apart. Play designs keep defenses guessing every season. Quarterbacks thrive in his system because it allows freedom and structure at the same time.\n\nYears of playoff success place him among the best in NFL history. Consistency defines his career more than any single season. Few active coaches match his résumé.\n\nActive Super Bowl-winning head coaches represent the highest level of achievement in the NFL. Each one reached the top through different paths. Some relied on defense. Others built great offenses. Experience and adaptability connect them all. Their championships show what strong leadership can do for a team. As seasons continue, these coaches will try to add more titles and strengthen their legacy.\n\nThe post Active Super Bowl winning head coaches in the NFL appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Jalen Hurts has a different vibe after Eagles’ disappointing run originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNobody within the Philadelphia Eagles’ organization will question Jalen Hurts’ motivation to get back on the Super Bowl stage in 2026.\n\nThey’ve been here before. A few years back, Hurts led the Eagles to the Super Bowl and played nearly a perfect game. It didn’t matter in the end, as the Eagles lost to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIn the following year, the Eagles made it to the playoffs and fell out in the first round. But their window wasn’t closed. They bounced back with a deep playoff run, which concluded with a Super Bowl victory over the Chiefs. Hurts was crowned the game’s MVP.\n\nA pattern continued. The Eagles had a near collapse in 2025 after a solid start. When they got to the Wild Card stage, the Eagles didn’t have anything left in the tank. In a game where they were favored to win, the San Francisco 49ers stunned the Eagles in South Philly.\n\nHurts isn’t walking around with a sour reaction. Again, they’ve been here before. According to the AP’s Rob Maaddi, Hurts has had a different vibe lately. One that says he’s confident that all will be well when the next season fires up.\n\n“This was just one interaction with Jalen Hurts but I noticed he had a different vibe this week,” Maaddi said on X. “Teammates noticed it, too. A couple guys told me they haven’t seen him smiling and having fun like he did throughout the Pro Bowl Games. He told me he’s in a good place mentally.”\n\nHurts had what many would consider a down year. The Eagles’ offense as a whole looked out of sorts more often than not. Their struggles in 2025 called for Kevin Patullo’s job.\n\nNext season, Hurts and the Eagles’ offense will get a fresh start, as the unit will feature multiple key changes, including the addition of a new offensive coordinator.\n\nIt’s difficult to predict where Sean Mannion can direct the Eagles’ offense, but Hurts’ high spirits is a sign that he’s optimistic about what’s to come. There’s a lot of pressure weighing on the three-time Pro Bowler to lead the Eagles to bounce back. That doesn’t seem to be fazing him so far.\n\nEagles' plans for A.J.

    "fullText": "Marc Guehi has quickly adapted to life at Manchester City since signing for the club from Crystal Palace during the January transfer window. Guehi has only made three appearances for City since arriving at the club. The England international has quickly settled into his role in Pep Guardiola’s side. Given Guehi’s pedigree as a centre-back, a person, and a leader, there was little doubt that he would make an immediate impact at City. He has done exactly that. Marc Guehi’s performance as Manchester City beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield was superb, and listening to Guehi speak after the game, he has quickly adapted to life as a player in Pep Guardiola’s system.\n\nThroughout the full 90 minutes as Manchester City beat Liverpool at Anfield, Marc Guehi, alongside Abdukodir Khusanov and Ruben Dias, put in a superb performance at centre-back. Guehi read the game exceptionally well. He also snuffed out danger exceptionally well when Liverpool pressed in the second half. Guehi isn’t the most physically imposing defender, but he knows how to use his body with his positioning supremely well. This stood out throughout yesterday’s match. Outside of the moment where Guehi picked up a yellow card for pulling back Mo Salah, Guehi almost put in a flawless performance at the back. Guehi’s performance was exceptional in a game City had to win, at a venue they typically don’t play well at.\n\nWhat stood out to me after the game, was Marc Guehi’s comments about what it took from his team to beat Liverpool at Anfield. Guehi said that each Manchester City player had to sacrifice for the team to prosper against Arne Slot’s side. In quotes relayed by CityXtra, Guehi explained: “When you’re trying to win games, especially against tough opposition like Liverpool, that’s the standard. It has to be every single person giving every single bit of energy and effort for their brother next to them, and everyone did that today.”\n\nAs Manchester City has embarked on their rebuild, Pep Guardiola has spoken of the importance of team spirit throughout this season. It is a vital ingredient of what typically makes Pep Guardiola’s sides so great. Team spirit underpins everything that City do. The free-flowing and dominant football that is associated with Pep Guardiola teams comes from strong team spirit. Listening to Marc Guehi speak and watching him play, he has fully embraced this side of this Manchester City team. Guehi is often seen celebrating a great defensive effort from his teammates or an inspired save by Gianluigi Donnarumma. These moments might seem small, but they all form an important part of the team spirit that Pep Guardiola is building with his new-look team.\n\nMarc Guehi looks right at home at Manchester City. The England international has slotted seamlessly into City’s defence. He has also fully embraced the team spirit that City is building. That seems like an underrated aspect of this City team, but it is a vital component of what Pep Guardiola is putting together. It also played a key role in Manchester City’s come-from-behind win over Liverpool.",

    "fullText": "MLB Network’s “The Shredder”, an annual ranking system, chose Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman as the best first baseman in MLB.\n\nFreeman has topped the list three years in a row.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Freddie Freeman is the No. 1 first baseman on the #Top10RightNow! pic.twitter.com/kzKjMdrwmW\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Shredder uses past performances, offensive and defensive metrics and MLB Network’s research team’s analysis determine each player’s position on the list.\n\nThe other players listed include the Boston Red Sox’s Willson Contreras, the Chicago Cubs’ Michael Busch, the Baltimore Orioles’ Pete Alonso, the Tampa Bay Rays’ Yandy Diaz, the San Francisco Giants’ Rafael Devers, the Toronto Blue Jays’ Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the Atlanta Braves’ Matt Olson and the Athletics’ Nick Kurtz.\n\nFreeman maintained his spot on the list after yet another fantastic season, grading as well above average in most offensive fields.\n\nhe hit 20 or more home runs for the ninth time in the last 10 seasons, and managed an .800 OPS or higher for the 14th consecutive year. He batted .295 last season, placing third in the NL, and made his fifth consecutive appearance in the All-Star Game.\n\nHaving topped the list last year, it wouldn’t have made sense to move Freeman from the top spot when his numbers improved from 2024. Freeman’s batting average, slugging percentage and OPS all increased from two seasons ago, and he also had more homers and RBIs in the same amount of games.\n\nAs the active hits, runs and RBIs leader, it’s hard to imagine anyone claiming his spot as long as he continues producing at the level he has been.\n\nFanGraphs Depth Charts projects a slight regression from Freeman heading into his 17th season, but believes he’ll match his 24 homers from 2025.\n\nThey project he’ll bat .284 with a .849 OPS, and finish the year with a 135 wRC+.\n\nIf Freeman can maintain these numbers, as he has for most of his career, he’ll surely place towards the top, if not at the top, of the first baseman rankings come next offseason. Freeman surely has bigger things on his mind, though, as the Dodgers are currently in pursuit of their third consecutive World Series title.",

    "fullText": "In the latest act of vandalism against the success of Chelsea, the club have just announced the departure of Paul Green, the Head of Women’s Football for the last 13 years of unprecedented success for the women’s team, building it pretty much from the ground up.\n\nThe club just put out a pretty terse statement given his incredible success and history, just a few paragraphs long, thanking him for his service.\n\nSonia Bompastor on the touchline. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nWe’re no experts on this side of things, so here are some quotes from people who are experts:\n\n“Paul Green’s exit is a major fork in the road for Chelsea, who are now run by sporting directors without women’s football expertise,” said Tom Garry from the Guardian.\n\n“It’s a seismic loss for Chelsea Women. In years to come, we’ll look back at this a bit like David Gill’s departure from Manchester United men, for example.”\n\nIf you want some context for the David Gill comparison – under him it was Fergie, titles and Champions Leagues. After him it’s been David Moyes, Ruben Amorim and mediocrity. If this move is even half as damaging as that, it’s a total disaster.\n\n“It is hard to have much faith in what the club are going to replace him with. A huge amount of institutional knowledge lost,” wrote Jessy PH from the Observer.\n\nChelsea may have won at the weekend, but the way they conceded from a set piece will have been very frustrating for a lot of people. There is a potential solution to solve our increasing concerns about the defensive side of corners and free kicks.\n\nCole Palmer scored three against Wolves, but one journalist pointed out that it was actually another Blue who had been their outstanding attacker in the game.",

    "fullText": "In what was one of the most entertaining contests of the Serie A campaign, Juventus and Lazio shared the spoils with the final score showing 2-2.\n\nPrior to the 45th-minute mark, had someone offered Maurizio Sarri’s men a draw, they would have probably bitten his hand off. After all, the Biancocelesti were disoriented, outplayed, and suffocating from the pressure posed by the Bianconeri, who by all means should have been in the lead if it wasn’t for their lacklustre finishing.\n\nAnd yet, when the final whistle blew, Lazio were left to rue a golden opportunity to complete the double over their northern rivals, as they had squandered a healthy two-goal lead and conceded a 96th-minute equalizer.\n\nSo here are our three takeaways from a thrilling match that may have appeased the neutral but left both sets of players disgruntled with the lack of points they earned.\n\nWhile Alessio Romagnoli’s departure was delayed, it remains very much on the cards ahead of the upcoming summer, as the unhappy defender is still betrothed to Al-Sadd. But while Sarri had depicted the 31-year-old exit as a major tragedy for the backline, Oliver Provstgaard has once again proved he’s up to the task, putting on a big performance against a top opponent.\n\nWatch: Juventus & Lazio Share the Spoils in Four-Goal Thriller – The Highlights\n\nNeedless to say, the Dane cannot be expected to organize the backline and act as a defensive leader at the age of 22, but he offers a robust presence at the back and is willing to put his body in harm’s way.\n\nIf Mario Gila is also destined to leave, then Lazio should try to pair Provstgaard with an experienced profile who can act as a mentor and help him improve his game, as he has the potential to become one of the best centre-backs in the league.\n\nOn Sunday, Sarri was proven right, as Daniel Maldini was indeed the right choice for the centre-forward role. The 24-year-old had a slow start, but he gradually grew into the match and became a thorn in Gleison Bremer’s side, not to mention picking Manuel Locatelli’s pocket to create an out-of-the-blue opening goal.\n\nDaniel Maldini (Photo by Marco Rosi – SS Lazio/Getty Images)\n\nThe versatile attacker is seemingly capable of leading the line in this sort of contest, with Lazio laying low and harrying their opponents on the counterattack. However, it remains to be seen if he can be as effective against compact defences, when he’d have to go shoulder-to-shoulder in tight spaces against centre-backs.\n\nIt should be remembered that the third-generation player often dropped deep or drifted wide on his debut against Genoa, suggesting he wasn’t entirely comfortable with that role. Nevertheless, Sarri will be keen to round out his skill set and win this bet, as he doesn’t seem to be too fond of Petar Ratkov, who represents a more classic version of a centre-forward.\n\nWhen Sarri proclaimed that Matteo Guendouzi wasn’t properly replaced, he certainly had a valid point. The Lazio head coach switched the left-footed Toma Basic to the right side of the midfield trident to fill the gap, but the Croatian has now sustained an injury that could keep him out for a while.\n\nThis knock served as a massive blow for the Aquile, as the lack of quality options in the middle of the park has been exposed. Fisayo Dele-Bashiru came on for Basic, but the Nigerian’s mediocre display justified Sarri’s reluctance to play him. Reda Belahyane is almost in the same boat, while thrusting Adrian Przyborek in this role could be premature.\n\nPlayer Ratings: Juventus 2-2 Lazio – Maldini Announces His Arrival\n\nSince the start of the season, Sarri had insisted that he only sees Danilo Cataldi and Nicolo Rovella as deep-lying playmakers. But as they say, desperate times require desperate measures, and the Tuscan tactician has certainly been forced into making significantly more bizarre choices throughout this unusual campaign than to combine the two Italian midfielders.\n\nOnce fit, Rovella can be easily considered Lazio’s most skilful midfielder, while Cataldi has arguably been the most reliable this term. Hence, dropping one or the other to the bench while fielding underachievers would be criminal.\n\nOn the other hand, a midfield trident of Kenneth Taylor, Cataldi and Rovella could be Lazio’s best possible option at this stage, regardless of which Regista is switched to the box-to-box role.",

    "fullText": "Thomas Frank says he does not mind fans singing the names of former Spurs players and managers.\n\nThe Dane is under pressure at Tottenham having won just one of his last ten Premier League games and none of the last seven, with Spurs sitting 15th in the table.\n\nBut despite continued criticism from supporters and chants for managers and players of years gone by, Frank says he recognises the achievements of those who came before him.\n\n“I met Mauricio (Pochettino) a few times, a great guy, a great coach,” he said when asked about the fans singing the former Spurs boss’ name at games.\n\n“I think he’s a legend. I don’t think he won a trophy, but for me, he was part of transforming the club, where it was at that stage, to where it ended up being in terms of being close to winning the Premier League title, getting into the Champions League final.\n\n“If you’re close, then you’re very close to winning. Sometimes, you know, that’s football, there’s margins. I think Mauricio has done a top job here and he’s a true legend. If the fans sing their names, it’s well deserved.”\n\nSpurs take on Newcastle in their next Premier League clash as they look to improve their woeful run of form.\n\nBut Frank says he is confident his players are continuing to fight for him despite their results.\n\n“I haven’t seen one Premier League game that the players don’t want to run and fight,” he said.\n\n“So they need to continue it and keep doing what we believe is the right thing, and then it will turn. I’ve never experienced that it will not turn, so I experience it will turn again.\n\n“We can talk about the bottom of the table, or the top of the table, but it’s about the next game.\n\n“I’m fully, fully focused about that. Because there’s also one thing for sure, if you’re too afraid of achieving whatever you want to achieve, you can’t focus, so you just need to focus on your task and need to focus on the next game and do everything you can to win that.\n\n“It’s probably the most competitive Premier League in the five years I’ve been there. So it just makes it very, very difficult every game.”",

    "description": "AI language models excel in medical exams – but when real people ask them for advice, collaboration fails.",
    "fullText": "Large language models like GPT-4o are now achieving near-perfect results in medical knowledge tests. They pass the US medical licensing exam, summarize patient records, and can classify symptoms. Health authorities worldwide are therefore examining whether AI chatbots could serve as the first point of contact for patients – a kind of \"new gateway to the healthcare system,\" as stated in a strategy paper by the UK's NHS.\n\nHowever, the study \"Reliability of LLMs as medical assistants for the general public: a randomized preregistered study\" by researchers from the University of Oxford significantly dampens these hopes. The work is published in the journal Nature Medicine, and a pre-print version is available on arXiv. The central finding: the clinical knowledge of the models cannot be transferred to interactions with real people.\n\nFor the randomized, controlled study, the researchers recruited 1298 participants from Great Britain. Each subject was presented with one of ten everyday medical scenarios – such as sudden severe headaches, chest pain during pregnancy, or bloody diarrhea. The task: to assess what illness might be present and whether a doctor's visit, the emergency room, or even an ambulance was necessary.\n\nThe participants were randomly divided into four groups. Three groups had access to one AI model each, which was current at the start of the study – GPT-4o, Llama 3, or Command R+. The control group was allowed to use any aids, such as an internet search.\n\nThe results reveal a remarkable discrepancy. Without human involvement, even the language models, which are no longer current, identified at least one relevant illness in 94.9 percent of cases. When asked for the correct course of action – self-treatment, GP, emergency room, or ambulance – they were correct on average in 56.3 percent of cases.\n\nHowever, as soon as real people queried the models, the values plummeted. Participants with AI support recognized relevant illnesses in only a maximum of 34.5 percent of cases – significantly worse than the control group with 47 percent. When choosing the correct course of action, all groups performed equally: around 43 percent accuracy, regardless of whether a chatbot assisted or not.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the chat logs between users and AI models to understand the causes. They identified two central weaknesses: Firstly, participants often provided incomplete information to the models. Secondly, users did not correctly understand the AI's responses – even though the models named at least one correct diagnosis in 65 to 73 percent of cases, participants did not reliably adopt them.\n\nDr. Anne Reinhardt from LMU Munich sees a fundamental gap here: \"Many people quickly trust AI answers to health questions because they are easily accessible. They also sound very convincing linguistically – even when the content is actually medically completely wrong.\"\n\nThe researchers compared the performance of the models on the MedQA benchmark – a standard test with questions from medical exams – with the results of the user study. In 26 out of 30 cases, the models performed better on multiple-choice questions than in interactions with real people. Even benchmark values of over 80 percent sometimes corresponded to user results below 20 percent.\n\nProf. Ute Schmid from the University of Bamberg critically assesses the high performance of the models \"alone\": \"I find the statement that the performance of the language models is significantly higher 'alone' than with users somewhat misleading. In this case, the queries were likely formulated by individuals with expertise and experience with LLMs.\"\n\nThe experts agree that specialized medical chatbots would need to be designed differently from current all-purpose models. Prof. Kerstin Denecke from the Bern University of Applied Sciences outlines the requirements: \"A medically specialized chatbot would need to provide evidence-based, up-to-date information. Furthermore, it would need to reliably recognize emergencies, consider individual risk factors, and transparently communicate its limitations. It should conduct a structured anamnesis to reliably triage. And it should not be tempted to make a diagnosis.\"\n\nHowever, the hurdles for such use are considerable, according to Denecke: \"Major hurdles are, on the one hand, regulation – depending on the function as a medical device or high-risk AI. On the other hand, there is liability, data protection, and technical integration into care processes.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the Oxford researchers is clear: Before AI systems are deployed in healthcare, they must be tested with real users – not just with exam questions or simulated conversations. Schmid advocates for a differentiated approach: \"Quality-assured chatbots could, for example, be offered through statutory health insurance funds and recommended by general practitioners' offices as a first point of access. However, people should not be forced to use these services.\"\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "fullText": "University professor Xavier Crettiez admits that he doesn't know the real names of many of the students on his course.\n\nThis is a highly unusual state of affairs in the world of academia, but Prof Crettiez's work is far from standard.\n\nInstead, he helps train France's spies.\n\n\"I rarely know the intelligence agents' backgrounds when they are sent on the course, and I doubt the names I'm given are genuine anyway,\" he says.\n\nIf you wanted to create a setting for a spy school, then the campus of Sciences Po Saint-Germain on the outskirts of Paris seems a good fit.\n\nWith dour, even gloomy-looking, early 20th Century buildings surrounded by busy, drab roads and large, intimidating metal gates, it has a very discreet feel.\n\nWhere it does stand out is its unique diploma that brings together more typical students in their early 20s, and active members of the French secret services, usually between the ages of 35 and 50.\n\nThe course is called Diplôme sur le Renseignement et les Menaces Globales, which translates as Diploma of Intelligence and Global Threats.\n\nIt was developed by the university in association with the Academie du Renseignement, the training arm of the French secret services.\n\nThis came following a request from French authorities a decade ago. After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the government went on a large recruitment drive within the French intelligence agencies.\n\nIt asked Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities, to come up with a new course to both train potential new spies, and provide continuous training for current agents.\n\nLarge French companies were also quick to show an interest, both in getting their security staff onto the course, and snapping up many of the younger graduates.\n\nThe diploma is made up of 120 hours of classwork with modules spread over four months. For external students – the spies and those on placement from businesses – it costs around €5,000 ($5,900; £4,400).\n\nThe core aim of the course is to identify threats wherever they are, and how to track and overcome them. The key topics include the economics of organised crime, Islamic jihadism, business intelligence gathering and political violence.\n\nTo attend one of the classes and speak to the students I had to be vetted first by the French security services. The theme of the lesson I joined was \"intelligence and over-reliance on technology\".\n\nOne of the students I speak to is a man in his 40s who goes by the name Roger. He tells me in very precise, clipped English that he is investment banker. He adds: \"I provide consultancy across west Africa, and I joined the course to provide risk assessments to my clients there.\"\n\nProf Crettiez, who teaches political radicalisation, says there has been a huge expansion in the French secret services in recent years. And that there are now around 20,000 agents in what he called the \"inner circle\".\n\nThis is made up of the DGSE, which looks at matters overseas, and is the French equivalent of the UK's MI6 or the US's CIA. And the DGSI, which focuses on threats within France, like the UK's MI5 or the US's FBI.\n\nBut he says it's not just about terrorism. \"There are the two main security agencies, but also Tracfin an intelligence agency which specialises in money laundering.\n\n\"It is preoccupied with the surge in mafia activity, especially in southern France, including corruption in the public and private sectors mainly due to massive profits in illegal drug trafficking.\"\n\nOther lecturers on the course include a DGSE official once located in Moscow, a former French ambassador to Libya, and a senior official from Tracfin. The head of security at the French energy giant EDF also runs one module.\n\nThe private sector's interest in the diploma is said to be continuing to grow. Big businesses, especially in the defence and aerospace sector, but also French luxury goods firms, are increasingly keen to hire the students as they face relentless cyber-security and spying threats as well as sabotage.\n\nRecently graduates have been snapped up by the French mobile phone operator Orange, aerospace and defence giant Thales, and LVHM, which owns everything from Louis Vuitton and Dior to champagne brands Dom Perignon and Krug.\n\nTwenty eight students are enrolled in this year's class. Six are spies. You can tell who they are, as they are the ones huddled together during class breaks, away from the young students, and not too overwhelmed with joy when I approach them.\n\nWithout saying their exact roles, and with arms crossed, one says the course is considered a fast-track stepping stone for a promotion from the office to field work. Another says he gets fresh ideas being in this academic environment. They signed the day's attendance form with just their first names.\n\nOne of the younger students, Alexandre, 21, says he wanted a deeper understanding of the looming economic war between Europe and China. \"Looking at intelligence gathering from a James Bond viewpoint is not relevant, the job is analysing risk and working out how to counteract it,\" he tells me.\n\nAnother class member, Valentine, also 21, says she was inspired by the popular, fictional French TV spy drama Le Bureau. \"Coming here to discover this world which I didn't know anything about except for the TV series has been a remarkable opportunity, and now I am very keen to join the security services.\"\n\nNearly half of the students in the class are in fact women. And this is a relatively recent development according to one of the lecturers, Sebastien-Yves Laurent, a specialist on technology in spying.\n\n\"Women's interest in intelligence gathering is new,\" he says. \"They are interested because they think it will provide for a better world.\n\n\"And if there is one common thread amongst all these young students it's that they are very patriotic and that is new compared to 20 years ago.\n\nIf you are keen to apply to get on the course, French citizenship is an essential requirement, although some dual citizens are accepted.\n\nYet Prof Crettiez says he has to be wary. \"I regularly get applications from very attractive Israeli and Russian women with amazing CVs. Unsurprisingly they are binned immediately.\"\n\nIn a recent group photo of the class you can immediately tell who the spies are - they had their backs to the camera.\n\nWhile all the students and professional spies I met are trim and athletic, Prof Crettiez is also keen to dispel the myth of James Bond-like adventure.\n\n\"Few new recruits will end up in the field,\" he says. \"Most French intelligence agencies jobs are desk bound.\"",

    "description": "\"It’s very, very rare.\"",
    "fullText": "A hiker captured what he called an \"unprecedented\" moment at France's Isola 2000 ski resort: a massive pack of wolves calmly walking across a groomed ski slope.\n\n\"[I] have never experienced anything like this,\" he told Nice Matin, as reported by The Connexion.\n\nThe video was recorded on December 7, one day after Isola 2000 opened for the season. With the resort still quiet, the hiker encountered seven wolves walking across a freshly groomed slope.\n\n\"It's very, very rare. I'd never seen one before,\" he said, calling the sight \"a truly wonderful encounter.\"\n\nIsola 2000 sits in southeastern France near the Italian border, surrounded by Mercantour National Park — a protected area where wolf packs are known to roam. Still, sightings near developed areas are unusual.\n\nFrance's Office of Biodiversity reported about 15 wolf packs in the department as of 2023. The sighting also follows news of the country's first black-fur wolf pack in the neighboring Var region, suggesting ongoing shifts in regional wolf populations.\n\nThough peaceful, the encounter highlights how development pressures are compressing wild habitats. As resorts and recreation expand, close animal encounters become more likely.\n\nResearch shows humans and wildlife often cross paths in shared spaces — even unintentionally. Repeated exposure may also reduce animals' natural avoidance of people.\n\nSimilar issues are seen in the U.S., where hikers on popular trails have encountered bears with cubs. At the same time, conservation efforts show promise: in Indonesia, a critically endangered Javan rhino was recently born in a protected area.\n\nWolves are protected under French and European conservation law. Officials monitor packs and promote coexistence strategies, such as preserving corridors and limiting early-season disturbances.\n\nVisitors are urged to respect trail closures, keep their distance from wildlife, and recognize that such sightings increasingly reflect the overlap between human activity and natural ecosystems.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

    "description": "Pakistan’s president has warned that the Taliban's government in Afghanistan has created conditions “similar to or worse than” those before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a sign of rising tensions with ...",
    "fullText": "ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s president has warned that the Taliban's government in Afghanistan has created conditions “similar to or worse than” those before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a sign of rising tensions with Kabul after last week’s mosque attack in Islamabad, which analysts said Monday highlights militants’ reach to the capital.\n\nAsif Ali Zardari made the remarks while thanking the international community for condemning Friday's suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque that killed 31 worshippers and wounded 169. Without directly blaming India, Zardari also said Pakistan’s eastern neighbor was “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but regional and global peace.”\n\nIn a statement issued Sunday, Zardari said Pakistan “takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organizations posed threats to global peace.” He added that Pakistan had long maintained terrorism cannot be confronted by any single country in isolation.\n\nThe unusually strong comments were likely to irk Kabul and New Delhi, both of which have condemned the suicide attack claimed by the Islamic State group and have denied any involvement.\n\nThe previous Afghan Taliban government, which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, had been blamed for sheltering the al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden who was behind the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks that killed more than 3,000 people in the United States. The Afghan Taliban also allowed al-Qaida to operate training camps within Afghanistan, despite international warnings. However, bin Laden was killed during a U.S. commando operation in Pakistan in May 2011.\n\nLast week, Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry and New Delhi, in separate statements, rejected the Pakistani allegations, saying Islamabad had irresponsibly linked them to the attack.\n\nPakistan frequently accuses the Afghan Taliban, who returned to power in August 2021 in Afghanistan, of backing militants including the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Both deny the accusations.\n\nThere was no immediate response from India or Afghanistan to Zardari’s latest allegations, which came after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the bomber involved in the attack was a Pakistani and trained by the IS group in Afghanistan.\n\nNaqvi said security forces had arrested four suspects, including an Afghan national accused of links to the militant group and of helping mastermind the attack. The detainees included the bomber’s mother and brother-in-law, according to officials who said investigations into the attack were still ongoing.\n\nPakistan has not shared full details about the involvement of the bomber’s family, however.\n\nOn Monday, Naqvi received telephone calls from his Italian counterpart Matteo Piantedosi and European Commissioner Magnus Brunner, who condemned the mosque attack. According to a government statement, Naqvi maintained that “Pakistan is a shield for the world against terrorism and emphasized that strong global-level measures are needed today to protect the world from terrorism”.\n\nAsif Durrani, Pakistan’s former special representative for Afghanistan, said Zardari’s warning was “unambiguous: terrorism thrives where it is tolerated, facilitated, or used as a proxy.” He wrote on X that “allowing terrorist groups to operate from Afghan soil and India’s use of proxies to destabilize Pakistan is a dangerous path with grave regional and global consequences.” Durrani added, “Peace demands responsibility, not denial.”\n\nAnother Islamabad-based analyst, Abdullah Khan, said the preliminary findings into the mosque bombing suggest the attack may reflect a pattern seen in some IS attacks involving close family networks. He said the IS affiliates have at times recruited entire families, pointing to past attacks in Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nAlthough Islamabad has seen fewer attacks than some other regions, Pakistan has experienced a recent rise in militant violence, much of it attributed to Baloch separatist groups and the TTP, which is separate from but allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban.\n\nThe Islamic State’s regional affiliate, a major Taliban rival, has carried out attacks across Afghanistan.",

    "description": "A supercharged neutrino that smashed into our planet in 2023 may have been spit out by an exploding primordial black hole with a \"dark charge.\" If true, this theory could lead to a definitive catalog ...",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAn impossibly powerful \"ghost particle\" that recently slammed into Earth may have come from a rare type of exploding black hole, researchers claim.\n\nIf true, the extraordinary event may prove a theory that could upend our understanding of both particle physics and dark matter, the team argues. However, this is just one theory, and there is no direct evidence to confirm that this is indeed what happened.\n\nIn early 2023, researchers at the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT) — a massive, newly constructed array of sensors at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea — detected a neutrino, a ghostly particle that has almost no mass and does not readily interact with most matter.\n\nIn addition to neutrinos' typical weirdness, this specific particle was noteworthy for its unusual intensity. It hit our planet with an estimated energy of up to 220 quadrillion electron volts, which is at least 100 times more powerful than any other neutrino detected to date and around 100,000 times greater than anything observed within human-made particle accelerators, like CERN's Large Hadron Collider.\n\nResearchers were initially unsure what caused this \"impossible\" neutrino to appear. It may have been birthed when a cosmic ray entered Earth's atmosphere, unleashing a cascade of high-energy particles that rained down on the planet's surface. However, its unprecedented power led experts to assume that it must have originated from some high-energy cosmic event that we don't fully understand.\n\nIn the new paper, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Physical Review Letters, one research group believes they have finally identified what really birthed the neutrino: an exploding, primordial black hole (PBH).\n\nPBHs are a hypothetical class of black holes that are extremely small — potentially ranging from the size of an atom to a pinhead — and likely date back to the first moments after the Big Bang. The concept was first popularized by British physicist Stephen Hawking in the early 1970s, who also hinted that these miniature singularities would emit large quantities of high-energy particles, dubbed Hawking radiation, as they slowly evaporated. In theory, this would also mean they have the capacity to explode.\n\n\"The lighter a black hole is, the hotter it should be and the more particles it will emit,\" study co-author Andrea Thamm, a theoretical physicist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said in a statement. \"As PBHs evaporate, they become ever lighter, and so hotter, emitting even more radiation in a runaway process until explosion.\"\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries surrounding the impossible neutrino, aside from its immense power, is that it was not observed by other neutrino detectors around the world, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory buried beneath Antarctica's icy surface. Given that PBHs are supposed to be fairly common throughout the universe, one would reasonably expect that similarly powerful particles also would have been detected before or since this possible discovery, especially as the number of neutrino detectors is quickly increasing.\n\nThe researchers said this is because the neutrino was emitted by a special type of PBH, dubbed a quasi-extremal PBH, which has a \"dark charge\" — a version of regular electric force that includes a very heavy, hypothesized version of the electron dubbed a \"dark electron.\"\n\nThe dark properties of this theoretical type of PBH make it less likely that these black holes' explosions would be detected, the researchers suggested. It may also be that some of the less-powerful neutrinos detected to date may be partially incomplete detections of these events, they added.\n\n\"A PBH with a dark charge has unique properties and behaves in ways that are different from other, simpler PBH models,\" Thamm said. \"We have shown that this can provide an explanation of all of the seemingly inconsistent experimental data.\"\n\nWhile the new research hints at the existence of quasi-extremal PBHs, it does not confirm them or prove that they explode as the researchers think. (Regular PBHs have never been directly observed, either, although there is a strong consensus that they exist.)\n\nHowever, the team is confident that it will not take long to prove these dark explosions are real. The same research group recently predicted that there is a 90% chance we will see the first quasi-extremal PBH blow up by 2035, which would be extremely exciting for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, these explosions would be so powerful that they would probably emit \"a definitive catalog of all the subatomic particles in existence,\" including known entities, like the Higgs boson; theorized particles, like gravitons or time-traveling tachyons; and \"everything else that is, so far, entirely unknown to science,\" the researchers wrote in the statement.\n\n—Atom-size black holes from the dawn of time could be devouring stars from the inside out\n\n—A 'primordial' black hole may zoom through our solar system every decade\n\n—Some objects we thought were planets may actually be tiny black holes from the dawn of time\n\nSecond, these black holes could help reveal the mysterious identity of dark matter — the invisible stuff that we cannot see, yet whose gravitational force we can detect within almost every observed galaxy, including the Milky Way. The researchers wrote that quasi-extremal PBHs \"could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe,\" so finding one could help put this mystery to bed. (Despite the similar names, dark matter is not directly related to dark charge or dark electrons.)\n\nThe researchers, along with several other teams in the fields of physics and cosmology, are now holding their collective breath to see when the first explosion might be detected.\n\nThis \"incredible event\" would provide a \"new window on the universe\" and help us \"explain this otherwise unexplainable phenomenon,\" study lead author Michael Baker, a theoretical physicist at UMass Amherst, said in the statement.",

    "fullText": "BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq announced on Monday that a high-level security officer during the rule of Saddam Hussein has been hanged for his involvement in the 1980 killing of a prominent Shiite cleric.\n\nThe National Security Service said that Saadoun Sabri al-Qaisi, who held the rank of major general under Saddam and was arrested last year, was convicted of “grave crimes against humanity,” including the killing of prominent Iraqi Shiite cleric Mohammed Baqir al-Sadr, members of the al-Hakim family, and other civilians.\n\nThe agency did not say when al-Qaisi was executed.\n\nAl-Sadr was a leading critic of Iraq's secular Baathist government and Saddam, his opposition intensifying following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, which heightened Saddam’s fears of a Shiite-led uprising in Iraq.\n\nIn 1980, as the government moved against Shiite activists, al-Sadr and his sister Bint al-Huda — a religious scholar and activist who spoke out against government oppression — were arrested. Reports indicate they were tortured before being executed by hanging on April 8, 1980.\n\nThe execution sparked widespread outrage at the time and remains a symbol of repression under Saddam's rule. Saddam was from Iraq's Sunni minority.\n\nSince the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, authorities have pursued former officials accused of crimes against humanity and abuses against political and religious opponents. Iraq has faced criticism from human rights groups over its application of the death penalty.",

    "title": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show was a perfect artistic statement — except for Lady Gaga's cameo",
    "description": "Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, singing a salsa-inspired rendition of \"Die With a Smile.\"",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny brought the fiesta to the Super Bowl on Sunday, performing reggaeton hits and paying tribute to his Latino heritage — but for a halftime show rich with symbolism and lovingly curated details, one moment felt curiously out of place.\n\nAbout five minutes into Bad Bunny's performance, Lady Gaga materialized out of the blue to sing a salsa-inspired rendition of \"Die With a Smile,\" her popular duet with Bruno Mars from her latest album, \"Mayhem.\" It was a strange choice that, while entertaining enough, felt out of step with the rest of the Puerto Rican superstar's performance.\n\nFrom the moment Bad Bunny stepped on the field, he made the celebratory themes of his performance clear. His set was about Puerto Rican pride: There were dancers dressed as jíbaros in pavas (farmers in traditional straw hats), vendors selling coco frio and piraguas (chilled coconut and shaved ice), and, of course, his signature blend of party-starting beats and culturally significant lyrics.\n\nThe second song in his set list, \"Yo Perreo Sola,\" is sung from a woman's perspective to protest sexual harassment in clubs, while \"Eoo\" pays tribute to the caseríos (public housing in Puerto Rico) where reggaeton was born and nurtured. It was as much a celebration of Puerto Rican history and culture as it was a spectacle for NFL fans, if not more.\n\nSo, as a viewer, when Gaga appeared, there was no obvious reason for her to be there. She didn't cover one of Bad Bunny's songs, as her fellow guest Ricky Martin did later in the show with \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.\" She didn't sing her own beloved song \"Born This Way,\" which would have fit the show's broader themes of unity and acceptance, or even \"Alejandro,\" which incorporates Latin pop production. Instead, she opted for her most recent hit, which had no clear thematic connection (her duet partner, Mars, who has Puerto Rican heritage through his father, was not in attendance).\n\nBecause so much of Bad Bunny's show — from his wardrobe to his props and set design — felt deliberate and carefully planned, Gaga's surprise cameo stuck out even more. It felt as if she were simply filling a gap in the production schedule left open for extra star power.\n\nThis isn't to say Gaga didn't nail her vocals (she always does), or that she had anything but good intentions for accepting Bad Bunny's invitation. The two singers have long expressed respect and admiration for each other; in fact, Bad Bunny is a certified Little Monster. He cited Gaga's music as an entry point for appreciating drag culture, and he gushed over her 2020 album \"Chromatica.\" In 2023, Gaga even introduced Bad Bunny as a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nIt could very well be that Bad Bunny asked Gaga to join his Super Bowl performance because he wanted her there, and to that, I have no objection. Still, if they were saving room in the show for randomness and whimsy, she could've at least sung \"Abracadabra.\"",

Musk did not respond to the investigation at the time.\n\n\"The funny part about that clown's analysis is that even if every bit of bullshit he says is true, it still amounts to less than 1% of the value of Tesla and SpaceX,\" Musk responded on X on Sunday, followed by two crying-laughing emojis. \"Where did the other 99% come from?\"\n\nTesla has a market capitalization of around $1.5 trillion. SpaceX is reportedly planning to go public at a similar valuation later this year.\n\nMusk's retort comes at a time of intense scrutiny of the tech billionaire, his companies, and their reliance on government support. Tesla is facing fresh questions over the feasibility of Musk's vision of self-driving cars and humanoid robots as its core auto business continues to slow. Meanwhile, SpaceX has moved to acquire Musk's AI company, xAI.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Musk replied to another user who wrote that Starlink \"already produces massive cash\" and \"Elon doesn't need military money.\"\n\n\"True. I love NASA, but they will only be ~5% of SpaceX revenue this year,\" Musk wrote. \"Vast majority of SpaceX revenue is the commercial Starlink system.\"\n\nThe world's richest man later replied \"yes\" to a post saying the US government contracts with Musk because he's the \"most efficient vendor\" and saves the government money.\n\n\"SpaceX won the NASA contracts by doing a better job for less money,\" Musk said in a X post last July. \"Moving those contracts to other aerospace companies would leave astronauts stranded and taxpayers on the hook for twice as much!\"\n\nNASA relies heavily on SpaceX for transport to the International Space Station and for key elements of its moon-exploration program, Artemis. The Department of Defense taps Musk's rocket company for tasks such as satellite launches.\n\nAs an electric-vehicle manufacturer, Tesla earns regulatory credits that it sells to other automakers so they can comply with emissions standards and other requirements. Revenue from those accounted for about $2 billion last year.\n\nIn recent years, Musk has taken aim at government subsidies, saying that mature companies shouldn't receive them and public funds are better used elsewhere.

    "fullText": "YouTube's top creator, MrBeast, is making a leap into fintech by buying a consumer banking app geared toward teens.\n\nHis company, Beast Industries, is acquiring Step, according to a joint announcement sent Monday.\n\nStep, which describes itself as an \"all-in-one\" money app, is a digital banking platform designed to help young people get their financial start. The company offers a mix of services, including savings accounts, a credit-building Visa card that functions similarly to a debit card, and a cash-advance program. Step itself isn't a bank. It offers its banking services via a partnership with FDIC-member Evolve Bank & Trust.\n\n\"Financial health is fundamental to overall wellbeing, yet too many people lack access to the tools and knowledge they need to build financial security,\" Beast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold said in a statement. \"This acquisition positions us to meet our audiences where they are, with practical, technology-driven solutions that can transform their financial futures for the better.\"\n\nThe companies did not disclose the terms of the deal. Step said in 2022 that it had raised $500 million in equity and debt from institutional investors, including General Catalyst, companies such as Stripe, and individuals like TikTok influencer Charli D'Amelio.\n\nBeast Industries, which was valued at about $5 billion in its latest round of funding, has been looking for new avenues to make money beyond media, including the possibility of launching a mobile phone service down the road.\n\nMrBeast's candy and chocolate business, Feastables, has been a big money maker for the influencer, pulling in over $200 million in 2024 revenue, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. Not all ventures have paid off. The MrBeast team is currently embroiled in a legal battle with a business partner over the operations of its burger business, MrBeast Burger.\n\nThe content creator — who has over 460 million YouTube subscribers — has been planning to break into fintech for months, filing a US trademark application for the name \"MrBeast Financial\" in October. The company teased launching a fintech business with services like student loans, insurance, or credit insights in an early 2025 investor pitch deck, Business Insider first reported. The deck said the company would break into the industry by finding a partner who had existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nIn January, when Beast Industries announced it raised $200 million from ethereum holding firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Housenbold said the company would explore \"ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nAs the company prepares to enter the finance business, MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, also said he wants to make videos about finance, such as \"educating people on investing and showing them what is a Roth IRA.\"\n\nDonaldson, who has spoken on many occasions about his personal finances, said in a Monday post on X (formerly Twitter) that he saw the Step acquisition as an opportunity to \"give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.\"\n\n\"Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,\" he wrote.",

The company — a software provider for payroll, talent management, and expense processing — said Eschenbach will become a strategic advisor to Bhusri.\n\n\"As we enter a defining moment shaped by AI, there is no one better than Aneel to lead this next chapter,\" said Mark Hawkins, Workday vice chair and lead independent director, in a public statement. \"His vision, conviction, and deep connection to Workday's culture will position the company to continue to lead in a changing landscape.\"\n\nShares of Workday are down roughly 6% today, and down about 43% from a year ago.\n\nBhusri previously served as Workday's co-CEO from 2009 to 2014 with cofounder Dave Duffield. He was also CEO from 2014 to 2020 and co-CEO from 2020 to 2024. Further, Bhusri has been a member of Workday's board since its founding in 2005.\n\nIn announcing the recent layoffs, which affected about 2% of Workday's overall workforce, the company cited a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. It didn't blame artificial intelligence as a reason for the cuts.\n\nWorkday also announced a larger round of layoffs last year, citing a need to invest more heavily in strategic areas such as AI. It had more than 20,400 employees as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWorkday was one of many software companies whose share prices took a beating last week following the debut of Anthropic's industry-specific Claude Cowork plugin, which can perform clerical tasks such as tracking compliance. Others included Intuit, Salesforce, and LegalZoom.\n\nLast month in an interview with CNBC, Eschenbach pushed back on the idea that AI advancements would negatively impact Workday.\n\n\"We are uniquely positioned to be one of the AI winners in the enterprise because of our incumbency, and lastly, because of the trust we get from our customers,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \"We have the cleanest set of data in the industry, and AI is a tailwind for us.

    "fullText": "It wasn't until my junior year at Stanford University that I first heard about ChatGPT from classmates who'd mentioned they had \"chat\" summarize the class reading.\n\nWhen I asked them what they meant by \"chat,\" they told me all about the AI tool, chatGPT.\n\nI was an English major with a creative writing emphasis during my time at Stanford, so reading and writing were important to my work.\n\nI wanted to ask the students who used ChatGPT to do the reading: Why are you even at Stanford? Why be at any university at all? Isn't the point of pursuing higher education to expand our minds and become better communicators?\n\nAs I progressed through my studies, I would hear ChatGPT mentioned more and more often, with some college professors even adding an AI clause to their syllabi. Some instructors would allow students to use ChatGPT for assistance (a murky definition) while others wouldn't allow it at all.\n\nI refused to use the AI tool in any way.\n\nI didn't care if instructors allowed students to use ChatGPT. I deliberately chose not to use it at all.\n\nSure, studying and studying literature in particular was difficult, but this was why I'd chosen the major; it was challenging, and I wanted to become better with words.\n\nI chose to become an English major because I wanted to improve my writing. I lacked confidence in my writing because I didn't know how to use words when I first entered college. I didn't have that finesse.\n\nApart from wanting to become a better writer, I also wanted to defend my opinions and thoughts with flair. I wanted to articulate sentiment precisely and formulate strong arguments. I wanted to write strongly worded emails. I wanted to think and speak freely.\n\nI wouldn't have been able to achieve any of that if I used ChatGPT.\n\nWhenever I'd hear a peer say they just used ChatGPT for their homework assignments, I'd often think about the many deserving students who hadn't been offered a seat at the university — students who, in a heartbeat, would've happily done these assignments themselves.\n\nI had the privilege of studying words at a strong English literature department with so many fine writing instructors. I leaped at opportunities to have my very own work critiqued by great writers. I still can't fathom having \"my\" writing, either partially or entirely synthetic, reviewed by instructors.\n\nAfter all, I was writing in and walking about the same grounds that writing legends once did — writers like bell hooks, John Steinbeck, Karen Zacarías, and David Henry Hwang. With this writing pedigree in mind, I was inspired and motivated to write myself.\n\nNot a day goes by without me putting my English degree to good use. Not a day goes by without me being grateful to my past self for putting in the work to earn the degree herself — without ChatGPT.",

    "fullText": "OpenAI's Sam Altman used to think ads were gross.\n\nOpenAI has formally announced that it will start showing ads to some US users, starting Monday. The ads will show up for some of ChatGPT's free users, as well as some users who've subscribed to ChatGPT Go, a new $8-a-month tier the company rolled out last month.\n\nOpenAI says it will serve ads to you based on the conversation you're currently having with ChatGPT, as well as previous queries and chats. It will also factor in whether you've engaged with — or hidden —other ads it has shown you.\n\nFor now, the company says, it won't use data about what you do outside of ChatGPT to target ads inside the service. But I'd be surprised if they don't do that eventually, since just about every other big internet ad platform uses those signals.\n\nThe fact that ChatGPT is launching ads isn't news: The company has been circling the idea for months, and last month it formally announced that ads would be coming to the service.\n\nAnd that news became the subject of a back-and-forth between OpenAI and rival Anthropic, which included a testy social media post from Altman and a cheeky Super Bowl ad from Anthropic underlining the possible trust issues OpenAI may have once ads intermingle with \"organic\" results on the service.\n\nNow we'll see how these things actually look, and work — and what users and advertisers think of them.",

    "title": "Trump's plan to limit student loans for nurses is dominating the public's feedback on the repayment overhaul",
    "description": "Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul would place a lower student-loan limit on certain advanced degrees, including nursing.",
    "fullText": "Nursing programs are taking center stage in the public conversation on President Donald Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul.\n\nPublic comment on the Department of Education's proposed student-loan changes has been open for one week, giving anyone the opportunity to submit feedback. Those changes include new income-driven repayment plans, updates to the handling of defaulted student loans, and new borrowing caps for advanced programs.\n\nThe new borrowing caps, in particular, have sparked conversation and concern among advocates, lawmakers, and students. The department proposed a $100,000 lifetime borrowing limit for graduate students and a $200,000 limit for professional students, and narrowed the programs that would qualify as \"professional\" to 10, including medicine, dentistry, and law.\n\nPost-graduate nursing programs are not included in the professional definition, meaning that students in those programs would not qualify for the higher borrowing limit. Of the over 2,500 public comments received so far, more than 1,200 mentioned nursing. One comment, for example, said: \"During a critical nursing shortage it's vital that nurses are able to advance their education so they can teach the next generation of nurses.\"\n\nAnother comment said: \"Policies that make graduate nursing education less affordable will not only discourage nurses from advancing their education but will also reduce the number of nurse educators available to train the next generation of nurses. Fewer educators mean fewer nursing school slots and longer delays in bringing new nurses into the workforce, and ultimately compromising care.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, previously cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits when asked about concerns on the borrowing caps.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nData from the College Scorecard also showed that most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. Still, many of the comments expressed concern that the caps could exacerbate the existing healthcare shortage. In December, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent, urging him to revise the definition of a professional degree to include postgraduate nursing programs.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the lawmakers said. They referred to the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000 — double the proposed cap for the program.\n\nThe public comment period for the repayment proposals ends on March 2. The department said in a press release that it \"may make changes\" to its regulations based on the feedback it receives before moving toward final implementation this summer.",

    "fullText": "While theme park giants such as Disney and Universal have continued to see high visitor numbers in an uncertain economy, many smaller amusement parks and themed hotels in different parts of the world have struggled with rising operational costs, to the point of having to shut down business.\n\nAfter posting a loss of more than $1.2 billion at the end of 2025, Six Flags shared its intention to close more \"underperforming\" locations in its amusement and water park portfolio across North America. A Six Flags park in Maryland had closed down month earlier in November 2025.\n\nAt the start of the new year, the Cartoon Network Hotel serving primarily visitors to the Dutch Wonderland park in central Pennsylvania also shut its doors over a string of financial challenges dating back to the Covid pandemic.\n\nOperating in the British seaside town of Somerset since 1946, Brean Theme Park has become the latest theme park to risk a total shutdown after being assigned liquidators over its financial situation.\n\nThe 80-year-old park was originally a campsite for visitors to the coastline along the Bristol Channel but was expanded into a theme park with rides in the 1970s.\n\nThe park that had become beloved local staple known for its free entry (visitors paid credits for rides they wanted to take) had more than 40 attractions and was preparing to open for the summer season in March when it announced that it was taking \"resolutions for winding-up\" on February 4.\n\nNicholas Stafford of Hazlewoods LLP is the insolvency attorney overseeing the liquidation of Brean in a way that helps creditors and shareholders recoup some of their losses.\n\nAs a former public company, Brean stopped trading at the end of January and, short of a last-minute Hail Mary, will be shuttered forever in the coming weeks. The local notice announcing this decision states that \"the Company be wound up voluntarily.\"\n\nAccording to local reports, visitor numbers dipped significantly during the Covid pandemic, and the theme park was not able to recover from the debt created during that period.\n\nThe closure marks a significant blow to both the Somerset community and vacationers from nearby cities such as Gloucester and Bristol.\n\nThe struggling theme park had been renting land from Unity Holidays, the company also behind parks such as Brean Unity Holidays, Brean Splash, Brean Play, and Brean Gym, reported U.K. outlet Daily Express. Those parks, according to their ownership, will continue to operate in the coming summer.",

    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show has drawn criticism from the country's top Republican: Donald Trump said it was \"one of the worst, EVER!\" in a post on Truth Social.\n\nStrong words from the president — but this isn't the first time a musician has drawn ire from right-wing politicians and conservatives.\n\nStars like Lady Gaga, Cardi B, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, and Bruce Springsteen have riled up conservatives, often over progressive themes or sexual lyrics in their music. Keep reading for a list of notable instances in a loosely reverse-chronological order.\n\nReligious panic and conspiracy theories have plagued Lady Gaga for nearly her entire career. Her flamboyant pop music, avant-garde outfits, and advocacy for gay rights have attracted ire from right-wing organizations like the Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nIn 2010, Gaga urged her fans to ignore the Westboro protesters outside her concerts.\n\n\"Do not interact with them, or try to fight. Do not respond to any of their provocation. Don't waste your words or feelings, no matter what you hear or see,\" she wrote on social media. \"Be inspired to ignore their ignorant message, and feel gratitude in your heart that you are not burdened or addicted to hate, as they are.\"\n\nIn 2012, Christian groups in the Philippines tried to sabotage the Asian leg of Gaga's Born This Way Ball, specifically citing her song \"Judas\" as \"the work of Satan,\" per the Guardian. Her sold-out concert in Jakarta was canceled after authorities withdrew permission for her to perform.\n\nMore recently, Gaga's performance of \"Abracadabra\" at the 2026 Grammy Awards was cast as \"demonic\" and anti-American by conservative viewers online.\n\n\"Rainbowland\" was originally released in 2017 as the third track on Miley Cyrus' sixth album, \"Younger Now.\"\n\nThe song is a celebration of acceptance and individuality; Cyrus, who identifies as pansexual, duets with her godmother about a world \"where we're free to be exactly who we are.\"\n\nBut in 2023, when a first-grade class in Wisconsin wanted to sing \"Rainbowland\" for their spring concert, school administrators axed the plan.\n\nIn a statement provided to Business Insider, school-district superintendent James Sebert said the teacher who suggested the song \"Rainbowland\" checked with the school principal \"to determine if the song would be acceptable to use in a first grade concert.\"\n\nWhen the principal reviewed the song alongside a district policy about \"Controversial Issues in the Classroom,\" they \"determined that the song could be deemed controversial in accordance with the policy,\" the statement said.\n\nLil Nas X's \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" rode a wave of conservative backlash to a No. 1 debut on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song is about \"gay sex,\" in Lil Nas X's own words. He told Genius that he intentionally included some explicit lyrics to help \"normalize\" queer lust in music.\n\nThis angered some parents, who claimed Lil Nas X betrayed children who loved his hit single, \"Old Town Road.\"\n\nThe \"Montero\" music video — which shows Lil Nas X riding a stripper pole down to hell and giving Satan a lap dance — also sparked outrage from conservative pundits and politicians, including Candace Owens, a right-wing media personality, and Kaitlin Bennett, better known online as the Kent State \"gun girl,\" as well as commentators on Fox News.\n\nThe controversy even elicited a response from South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who slammed Lil Nas X for promoting the song by releasing a limited line of \"Satan Shoes.\"\n\nRight-wing media personalities had a collective meltdown in 2020 when Cardi B released \"WAP,\" her hit collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nThe song delights in filthy wordplay and explicit expressions of lust, with both rappers bragging about their healthy signs of arousal.\n\nConservative talk-show host Ben Shapiro even took the time to read the lyrics of \"WAP\" on his live radio show, declaring, \"This is what feminists fought for.\"\n\nCardi wasn't fazed: \"I can't believe conservatives soo mad about WAP,\" she tweeted, and reposted a collection of fan-made memes about Shapiro reciting her \"vulgar\" lyrics.\n\nMegan told Time she was \"taken aback\" by the backlash: \"Like, why is this your focus right now? If you have an issue with what I'm saying don't listen to it. Tune out, 'cause I didn't ask you to tune in.\"\n\nCardi also responded to the outrage surrounding their rendition of \"WAP\" at the 2021 Grammys, which reportedly drew more than 1,000 complaints to the FCC. Fox News host Tucker Carlson told viewers, \"they're intentionally trying to degrade our culture and hurt our children,\" while Candace Owens called the performance \"a destruction of American values.\"\n\n\"Yaaaayyyyyyy WE MADE FOX NEWS GUYS !!! Wap wap wap,\" Cardi wrote on Twitter.\n\nTaylor Swift became a target for conservative politicians and members of the alt-right when she broke her political silence in 2018, endorsing two Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee.\n\nThe following year, Swift built on this momentum with \"You Need to Calm Down,\" a pro-gay song that explicitly advocated for the Equality Act, a bill that would create antidiscrimination regulations for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nConservative websites like The Daily Signal slammed the song's message, while Kellyanne Conway, then serving as senior counselor to the president, used Swift's own lyrics to mock her activism.\n\nIn recent years, Swift has become a favored target for Trump, who wrote \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" on Truth Social after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024.\n\nChildish Gambino's \"This Is America\" became a cultural phenomenon in 2018, praised for its harsh commentaries on gun violence and systemic racism. It went on to win record of the year at the Grammys.\n\nHowever, not all reactions were positive. Run-of-the-mill conservatives called it \"evil garbage\" on social media, while professional conservatives wrote scathing essays about its \"superficial\" lyrics and \"paranoid\" message.\n\nFar-right political commentators like Alex Jones and Gavin McInnes were similarly scandalized, describing the music video as a \"voodoo dance\" and declaring, \"Black violence is a bonfire.\"\n\nFox News pundits were up in arms after Kendrick Lamar's powerful performance of \"Alright\" at the 2015 BET Awards.\n\nThe song features lyrics condemning racism and police brutality (\"We hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho\").\n\n\"This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years. This is exactly the wrong message,\" Fox News anchor Geraldo Rivera said.\n\nLamar later responded to Rivera's comments during an interview with TMZ.\n\n\"How can you take a song that's about hope and turn it into hatred?\" he said. \"Hip-hop is not the problem. Our reality is the problem of the situation.\"\n\nThe rapper also sampled the news segment on his 2017 album \"Damn.\"\n\nIn 2010, one year before \"Hannah Montana\" ended, Cyrus released a new single called \"Can't Be Tamed.\"\n\nThe electro-pop song celebrates freedom and self-expression, especially in the face of scrutiny. In the music video, Cyrus plays a caged bird who is gawked at and photographed.\n\nIn response, the Media Research Center issued a statement titled \"The Miley Cyrus Effect: Young Girls Acting Like (Trashy) Adults.\"\n\nThe right-wing group, which describes itself as \"America's media watchdog,\" slammed Cyrus for \"dancing provocatively\" and apparently normalizing \"highly sexualized representations of women.\"\n\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" was released as Katy Perry's official debut single in 2008.\n\nHowever, she had previously released contemporary Christian music under her birth name, Katheryn Hudson.\n\nThe song's queer fantasy inspired a small moral panic from her former audience. Adam Holz of PluggedinOnline — a division of the conservative and anti-gay organization Focus on the Family — condemned the song in an article titled  \"A Tale of Two Katys.\"\n\n\"At the moment, Katy Hudson's flirty and 'dirty' alter ego is in the ascendant. Whether or not she'll ever 'come to her senses' as the Bible says the prodigal son did in Luke 15 remains to be seen,\" Holz wrote.\n\nHe added: \"Katy is indeed living down to a damaging, demeaning stereotype, one that our culture has already branded as 'girls gone wild.' Perhaps one day she'll recall the wisdom of her youth.\"\n\nInstead, as the years went on, \"I Kissed a Girl\" was seen as increasingly problematic on the other side of the aisle. Many progressives have criticized the song for trivializing lesbian relationships and feeding a biphobic narrative.\n\nPerry told Glamour in 2018 that she would change the lyrics if she were to release the song today: \"Lyrically, it has a couple of stereotypes in it. Your mind changes so much in 10 years, and you grow so much.\"\n\n\"Goodbye Earl\" is now known as one of The Chicks' most iconic hits, but when it was released as a single in 2000, some people were alarmed.\n\nThe song, written by Dennis Linde and initially recorded by Sons of the Desert, tells the story of two women named Mary Ann and Wanda, who murder Wanda's abusive husband with poison.\n\n\"The debate centers on whether the record sheds light on the problem of domestic violence or condones a murder by the abuse victim and her friend,\" the Los Angeles Times wrote at the time.\n\nIndeed, many country radio stations refused to play the song.\n\nThe backlash even compelled The Chicks to include a disclaimer in the album's liner notes: \"The Dixie Chicks do not advocate premeditated murder, but do love getting even.\"\n\nThree years later, The Chicks came under fire for criticizing then-President George W. Bush and the Iraq War. Conservative fans began boycotting their music, demanding that radio stations do the same. A group of protesters even bulldozed their CDs.\n\nBruce Springsteen wrote \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" after Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by New York City police in 1999.\n\nThe four officers fired 41 shots after Diallo, who was unarmed, apparently reached for his wallet. They were indicted on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment, but eventually acquitted of all charges.\n\nThe song includes the lyrics, \"You get killed just for living in your American skin.\"\n\nSpringsteen performed \"American Skin\" at Madison Square Garden in 2000, which prompted fury from the NYPD.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, Springsteen was criticized by then-Mayor Giuliani, then-Police Commissioner Howard Safir, and Patrick J. Lynch, then-president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, who urged officers to boycott Springsteen's concerts.\n\nIce-T's hard-rock project Body Count is most famous for their 1992 single \"Cop Killer,\" a protest song about racial profiling and police brutality.\n\nShortly after its release, then-President George H. W. Bush condemned \"sick\" rap songs and other forms of \"filth\" that \"rejoice in standing up against law enforcement.\"\n\n\"It is wrong for any company,\" he said, apparently referring to Ice-T's label Time Warner, \"to issue records that approve of killing a law enforcement officer.\"\n\nVice President Dan Quayle also criticized the song as \"outrageous.\" Senator Al Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, who's partially responsible for \"Parental Advisory\" labels on CDs, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post that compared Ice-T's rhetoric to Hitler's.\n\n\"As Nasty as They Wanna Be,\" the 1989 album from rap group 2 Live Crew, was banned from sale in southern Florida after a US District Court declared the album \"legally obscene.\"\n\nIn his opinion, U.S. District Judge Jose A. Gonzales Jr. of Fort Lauderdale wrote that 2 Live Crew's lyrics \"are replete with references to female and male genitalia, human sexual excretion, oral-anal contact, fellatio, group sex, specific sexual positions, sado-masochism, the turgid state of the male sexual organ, masturbation, cunnilingus, sexual intercourse, and the sounds of moaning.\"\n\nAs the Washington Post reported, possession of obscene material in Florida was punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. Some record store owners were arrested and convicted for selling the album.\n\nMembers of 2 Live Crew group were also arrested for performing the album in Broward County.\n\nIn 1992, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling on the grounds of artistic value.\n\nN.W.A.'s iconic protest song \"Fuck Tha Police,\" which appeared on their 1988 album \"Straight Outta Compton,\" was so reviled by law enforcement that it elicited rebuke from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nMilt Ahlerich, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Public Affairs, mailed a letter to the group's label, Priority Records, calling the song \"discouraging and degrading.\"\n\n\"Advocating violence and assault is wrong,\" he wrote, \"and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.\"\n\nIndeed, many police officers boycotted N.W.A. and refused to provide security for their concerts.\n\nIn 1977, amid Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee celebrations, the Sex Pistols released a song calling her reign \"the fascist regime.\"\n\nThe anti-monarchist sentiments of \"God Save the Queen\" were immediately condemned by conservatives across the nation, as well as by media companies like the BBC, which instituted a total ban on the song from its radio stations.\n\nLondon Councilor Bernard Brook Partridge, a high-profile Conservative Party politician, described The Sex Pistols as \"the antithesis of humankind\" and said he wished for their \"sudden death.\"\n\nAccording to the Guardian, the band was \"hassled by police and attacked by nationalist thugs.\" Some tabloids even accused them of treason.",

    "description": "Bolt Data and Energy was recently cofounded by Eric Schmidt and raised $150 million. Now it's in talks to have Google anchor Texas campus.",
    "fullText": "Bolt Data and Energy, a data center development firm that was cofounded late last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is negotiating a deal that would allow it to begin construction on a large data center project it is planning in West Texas.\n\nSchmidt's firm is in discussions with Google, his former employer, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. The tech giant, one of the leaders in the race to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence, is considering a commitment of 250 megawatts, according to one of the people. The other person said it was too early to characterize the exact size of the potential transaction because it was still under discussion.\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the potential transaction is still being arranged and the talks are confidential.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" a Google spokeswoman told Business Insider, declining to comment further. Google announced last year that it plans to build $40 billion of cloud and AI infrastructure in Texas by 2027.\n\nThe potential deal highlights how Big Tech is racing to secure the power, physical infrastructure, and land needed to fuel AI, even as the costs and financial risks of those bets loom.\n\nIn December, Bolt completed its first funding round, raising $150 million from investors, including $50 million from Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a public company that owns large tracts of land in West Texas. As part of the investment from TPL, Bolt will develop data centers on land in TPL's portfolio.\n\nA presentation detailing Bolt's development plans, shared with Business Insider, said that TPL's land would give it access to abundant power and water for cooling. These commodities have become increasingly strained as data center development has boomed around the country.\n\nThe presentation states that Bolt's development would begin with an \"initial 250 megawatt facility\" and expand in 250-500 megawatt increments into a 5 gigawatt campus.\n\nBolt's plan is one of several large-scale projects that have been envisioned in Texas to cater to the AI race. Fermi, a public company co-founded by former Texas governor and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has plans for an 11-gigawatt campus in Amarillo.\n\nIn December, Business Insider revealed that Amazon had pulled back a $150 million cash advance it had pledged as part of a preliminary deal to anchor the project. Fermi's disclosure of the reimbursement of that advance caused its stock to fall by 50%. Fermi's CEO, Toby Neugebauer, told Business Insider that although Amazon had reclaimed its advance, the negotiations for it to take space with Fermi were still ongoing.\n\nMajor bank lenders who extended $38 billion to finance the construction of data center campuses in Shackleford County, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, for Oracle and OpenAI, meanwhile, have had difficulty selling off pieces of the huge loan to other banks and investors. Those troubles stem, in part, from worries about whether Oracle's credit will be strained by its massive AI spending.\n\nTo help allay concerns, Oracle announced it would raise as much as $50 billion in debt and equity in 2026 to continue to pursue its AI buildout while also maintaining \"a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it plans to spend between $175 and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, roughly double its outlay in 2025. The spending is being done largely to pay for AI equipment and infrastructure.\n\nA record wave of spending has been announced by big technology companies on AI this year, including Amazon's disclosure during its earnings last week that it would spend $200 billion alone this year.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta has an internal prototype of an app for sending disappearing messages — but it isn't testing externally. Yet.",
    "fullText": "Hey Meta, are you also nostalgic for 2016?\n\nAs social media users wax poetic and share throwbacks about the social media heyday of 2016, it seems Meta wants to revive a piece of it.\n\nThe tech giant is working on an internal prototype of a new stand-alone app for sending disappearing photos, a spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nYes, that does sound like Snapchat's original premise.\n\nAccording to a screenshot shared by mobile developer Alessandro Paluzzi, who reverse engineers Instagram to reveal prototypes, the app is being called \"Instants.\"\n\n\"Share disappearing photos with friends,\" Paluzzi's rendering says.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said the stand-alone Instants app is not testing externally.\n\n#Instagram is working on a standalone app for Instants/Quicksnap 👀 pic.twitter.com/d56vOeoGap\n\nInstagram has also been testing a feature called Instants, which was previously called \"Shots,\" with some users of its main app. It has been a limited test available to \"some countries globally,\" the Meta spokesperson said.\n\nThe Instants feature lets Instagram users quickly send disappearing photos in their direct-messaging inbox. Once the photo message is opened, the photo disappears and expires 24 hours after sending, per Instagram's Help Center.\n\nInstants can only be \"sent to followers you follow back,\" the same help page says. The photos cannot be edited.\n\nThis isn't the first time Instagram has rolled out disappearing messaging tools.\n\nIn 2016, Instagram launched tools for disappearing text and photos in its DM product. The platform also introduced \"Vanish Mode\" in 2020, which lets users turn on disappearing messages by swiping up in the DM thread. These features are still live within the Instagram app, but Instants would be a new way to send disappearing content to friends.\n\nA new app from Meta shouldn't come as a surprise. It's rolled out several stand-alone apps in the company's recent history, including Threads, Edits, and Meta AI.\n\nInstagram has been doubling down on ways for friends — which Meta defines as people who mutually follow each other — to interact on the app.\n\nInfluencers, the rise of the creator economy, and advertising have turned Instagram into more of an entertainment platform than a social media platform. Now, people post less frequently to the main feed or stories, and instead, share content directly in DMs with their friends and family.\n\nHead of Instagram Adam Mosseri told Business Insider last year that there's been a \"paradigm shift\" toward more private sharing (like DMs) on the platform.\n\nMeta seems to be looking at Snapchat as a frequent source of inspiration for how people communicate with their closest friends.\n\nDisappearing messages aren't the only way Instagram has imitated Snapchat. Stories, famously, was a clone of Snapchat's highly successful product. Last year, Instagram also launched a social map feature similar to Snapchat's Snap Map.\n\nThere's a reason Snap CEO Evan Spiegel keeps \"VP Product @ Meta\" in his LinkedIn bio.",

    "description": "The recent tech sell-off spooked Wall Street, sparking a rerating of AI stocks. One analyst shares his criteria for picking winners in the AI race.",
    "fullText": "The tech stock sell-off that rattled Wall Street last week served as a reminder to investors that AI hype works both ways, and endless enthusiasm is no longer lifting all boats.\n\nThe dramatic downturn hit software stocks hardest, but it also spilled into the broader tech sector. Major indexes have broadly recovered from last week's sell-off, but investors are still on edge about what could be the next shoe to drop.\n\nAccording to Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman, the sell-off was a \"healthy, overdue rotation and a market demanding receipts.\"\n\n\"Ignore hype and look at growth and constraints,\" he told Business Insider. The analyst also shared some tips for picking AI stocks.\n\nHere is the framework Newman says he's using to spot winners and losers as the AI trade evolves.\n\nNot all companies spending on AI are seeing it pay off. While many on Wall Street chalk this up to the early innings of the emerging tech, companies that are seeing AI drive revenue are ones to look for.\n\n\"Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,\" Newman said.\n\nHe highlights Amazon and Microsoft as examples of AI spending fueling revenue real growth, through the tech giant'' respective cloud businesses, AWS and Azure.\n\nCompanies creating their own silicon chips are better positioned to compete. Capacity constraints control the AI race, with chip demand outpacing supply.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all working on their own custom AI chips.\n\nNewman highlighted that companies with in-house chips benefit from capacity advantages and vertical integration, which set them up for better margins.\n\nCompanies that have been successful in seeing a return on their AI spending have been largely focused on enterprise offerings. These include the cloud hyper scalers, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as Palantir, a favorite among retail traders.\n\nSome software companies are seeing enterprise monetization, despite the worries that sparked this week's sell-off. Newman highlights ServiceNow and IBM as \"companies driving agentic AI workflows and token consumption.\"\n\nElon Musk told Tesla investors on the company's most recent earnings call that its humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate up to $10 trillion in long-term revenue.\n\nNewman said that physical AI is the next multi-trillion-dollar market outside of data centers. He called out Amazon and Tesla as companies bringing AI to the physical world.\n\nThe market zeroed in on the software space for good reason, Newman said. \"I don't believe the AI will eat all software, but AI will eat some software,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe analyst explained that software companies with data running core business applications can survive in an AI era, but they will have to adapt to meet the needs of enterprise customers who want AI insights to fuel productivity gains.\n\nSome software companies partnering with AI factories include Salesforce and ServiceNow.\n\nAs AI-disruption concerns continue to fuel market skittishness, investors should be wary of companies without a clear narrative for how capex will deliver tangible results.\n\nAnother sign that an AI stock is risky may be that a company is using debt to finance AI infrastructure buildouts. Newman clarified that while debt isn't always a bad thing and can be a way to invest in critical growth, it can make a stock more of a risk-on play.\n\nIn a risk-off environment, Newman told Business Insider that there are a couple of things investors should be watching for.\n\n\"Look at the companies that can really afford to keep investing, for businesses that are going to basically create the cash flow that do it with the least risk.\"",

    "title": "West Coast Marines want to train 500 new drone pilots a year in a crash course on everything from flying to explosions",
    "description": "A new crash course is teaching Marines the ins and outs of drone warfare, from navigation in flight to explosive payloads.",
    "fullText": "West Coast Marines are learning how to operate attack drones in a new training course, part of a broader push to accelerate drone readiness across the force.\n\nThe new fast-paced crash course packs a lot into 15 days, teaching Marines how to fly the drones, handle aerial navigation, and safely prepare and deploy explosive payloads made with C-4.\n\nMarines spend several days on a drone simulator before progressing to cheap, expendable, off-the-shelf drones. From there, students move on to more complex systems, including drones built in-house by instructors and the Marine Corps' Neros Archer drone. Neros received a $17 million contract from the service last year for around 8,000 of its small drones.\n\n\"The simulators allow them to develop the core skills that we can then transition to our smaller drone for them to refine,\" said 1st Lt. Braeden McClain, an infantry officer overseeing the course.\n\nSo far, the course has certified 75 Marines as attack drone operators and hopes to graduate 500 a year. These aren't formal military occupational specialties like the positions tied to larger drone platforms; instead, the focus is on spreading drone training across the force.\n\nMuch of the training focuses on mission execution and safety, McClain told Business Insider. Marines fly drones through makeshift PVC gates, testing flight dexterity and aerial navigation as they guide the aircraft to grid coordinates for a strike. The drills are deliberately team-based, reflecting lessons the Marine Corps has drawn from the war in Ukraine, McClain said.\n\nMarines rotate through multiple roles — pilot, team leader, communications support, and payload preparation — while planning missions in detail, establishing checkpoints, and practicing \"talking on target,\" the process of verbally guiding a drone operator onto an objective. Each role comes with challenges, such as factoring in payload weight, radio frequencies, and wind, among other things.\n\n\"We've noticed that really the issue that most Marines struggle with is not the actual flying of the drone itself; it's kind of some of the more fundamental concepts, like aerial navigation,\" McClain said. \"Most Marines have never flown before, so now having them try to navigate through the air is a bit challenging.\" Having course instructors who were already hobby drone enthusiasts has been a boon, he said.\n\nThe training effort is part of a broader push to get American troops trained on drone operations as quickly as possible, a task that marks a sharp departure from the military's historically slow approach to adopting new technology. In recent months, the Pentagon has prioritized rapid defense modernization and closer collaboration with industry as battlefield lessons from Ukraine highlight how quickly drone warfare is evolving.\n\nLast year, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo directing the Pentagon to quickly overhaul drone acquisition and fielding processes in an effort to \"unleash\" US military drone dominance, including a push to field more than $1 billion worth of attack drones through 2028.\n\n\"Our acquisition system is designed to reduce acquisition risk to zero,\" Lt. Gen. Benjamin Watson, who oversees the Marine Corps' Training and Education Command, told reporters at the Modern Day Marine symposium last year. \"We've got to field drones at scale in order to be able to pressurize our training, really to work through some of the real hard problems.\"\n\nThe Marine Corps began authorizing more widespread drone training late last year as part of that Pentagon-wide push, and it is now seeking to add 10,000 drones to its inventory over the coming year.\n\nThe First Marine Division program operates under the broader umbrella of the Corps' lead organization for drone training, the Attack Drone Team headquartered in Quantico, Virginia. The Corps stood the team up last year to help develop standardized training pipelines across the force.\n\n\"Right now, our focus is on rapidly building proficiency by sending Marines to a variety of training courses and increasing hands-on familiarization,\" Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, the headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion, which oversees the Attack Drone Team, said last year. \"Our goal is to ensure they can not only operate these systems effectively but also integrate them seamlessly into a team.\"\n\nThat emphasis on team-based drone employment, and on constantly absorbing battlefield lessons from the war in Ukraine, means the course will have to continuously evolve, something not routinely seen in US military training.\n\nSuch immediate evolution is common in Ukraine though, where drone schools are updating their lessons frequently, as often as every two weeks, to keep up with developments on the battlefield.\n\nShifts in drone warfare have become a cat-and-mouse game, with each new tactic forcing a rapid counter. Radio-frequency drones are now routinely jammed, and that electronic warfare has driven the emergence of fiber-optic drones that are largely resistant to interference.\n\n\"At this rate, we see a significant advancement every three to six months,\" McClain said, describing how quickly tactics and technology are changing. \"Flexibility is definitely the name of the game.\"",

The letter said many of these have increased costs, disrupted market access, blocked access to labor, and stopped important agricultural research. Combined, these effects were deemed catastrophic.\n\n\"Our farmers and ranchers can compete with the world, but they can't compete with the world with a chaotic set of policy circumstances,\" said former chief executive of the National Corn Growers Association, Jon Doggett, per The New York Times.\n\nOther signers included Buzz Mattelin, the previous president of the National Barley Growers Association, and Bart Ruth, the previous president of the American Soybean Association.\n\nDomestic agriculture helps people in the U.S. meet their dietary needs. Collapse of the industry would also create steep economic and cultural loss. The challenges imposed by government policy are compounded by a wildly erratic climate.\n\nExisting and ongoing pollution is trapping heat in the atmosphere, which exacerbates destructive weather trends. This includes floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires, all of which pose existential threats to farmers. These weather shifts have also introduced new opportunities for the proliferation of pests, which could obliterate staple crops.\n\n\"Congress needs to assert itself on behalf of farmers if we are to avoid a widespread collapse of American agriculture and our rural communities,\" said the letter.\n\nThe letter recommended nine actions to alleviate the pressure on American farmers. These included exempting farm inputs from tariffs, supporting more trade agreements, and restoring funding to agricultural research.\n\nWhile institutional action is needed, there are individual actions that can be taken.\n\nAdopting a plant-based diet can ensure cropland is being used efficiently to feed people.

    "description": "The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower tariffs, reconfigure energy ties and deepen economic cooperation ​as both seek to realign global supply chains.\n\nThe India–U.S. joint statement suggested that New Delhi pushed back against Washington's efforts to ‌broadly open its agricultural market. However, India has agreed to lower trade barriers on some farm goods, drawing criticism from farmers and opposition parties.\n\nWHO GAINS FROM INDIA'S DECISION TO ALLOW ‌IMPORTS OF DDGS AND SOYOIL, AND WHO LOSES OUT?\n\nIndia is expected to allow imports of protein-rich distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a byproduct of ethanol made from corn and other grains, from the United States, adding to a surplus in the domestic market.\n\nHigher supplies of DDGS could benefit India's nearly $30 billion poultry sector, where feed costs account for around 60-70% of total production expenses, by helping reduce expensive feed purchases.\n\nDomestic oilseed processors and soybean farmers, however, may ⁠lose out if U.S. imports rise.\n\nThere are already ‌surplus supplies of DDGS in India, weakening demand for oilmeals such as soyameal, putting pressure on Indian oilseed prices and prompting farmers to switch from soybean and peanuts to corn and rice, despite New Delhi's push to boost ‍oilseed cultivation and curb imports.\n\nAs supplies of DDGS increase further, India's ethanol producers - already struggling with idle capacity and slowing demand after the country achieved its 20% biofuel blending target - may face lower earnings from DDGS sales in the domestic market.\n\nProspects of duty-free imports of soyoil from the U.S. have raised some concerns in India. ​But, under the current framework, duty-free soyoil imports will be allowed only under a tariff-rate quota, meaning volumes above the quota will face ‌standard tariffs, a move aimed at protecting domestic producers.\n\nWILL DUTY-FREE COTTON IMPORTS AFFECT INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia currently imposes an 11% duty on cotton imports, and allowing duty-free imports from the world's largest exporter of the fiber could put pressure on domestic prices.\n\nHowever, the impact is expected to be limited, as the government has permitted only imports of extra-long staple cotton, and that too under a quota.\n\nAlthough India is the world's second-largest cotton producer, it struggles to meet the textile industry's demand for extra-long staple cotton, which it imports from the U.S., Egypt, Brazil and Australia.\n\nDO CONCESSIONAL IMPORTS OF APPLES ⁠AND DRY FRUITS THREATEN INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia is the world's fifth-largest apple producer, but domestic ​supplies fall short of rising demand, driven by population growth and increasing prosperity.\n\nNew Delhi ​imports around 500,000 metric tons of apples annually from Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, the U.S. and Chile. Under a trade deal with the U.S., imports will be allowed at a concessional duty of 25% and a minimum import price of 80 ‍rupees per kg, effectively preventing shipments ⁠below 100 rupees per kg and helping protect Indian farmers.\n\nConsumption of dry fruits such as walnuts, almonds and pistachios has also been rising in India. Domestic production of these commodities is limited, so concessional imports are unlikely to affect local farmers.\n\nARE INDIAN FARMERS LIKELY ⁠TO BENEFIT FROM THE TRADE DEAL?\n\nIndian growers of tea, coffee, spices and fruits are set to gain from the trade deal, as the U.S. has granted duty-free access for ‌these products.\n\nThe reduction of import duties on rice to 18% is also expected to support exporters of both premium basmati and ‌non-basmati varieties.",

Sharma explained why he was leaving the artificial intelligence company and outlined his future plans.\n\n\"I achieved everything I wanted here,\" Sharma wrote, citing projects like developing defenses to reduce the risks of AI-assisted bioterrorism and a final project on understanding the effects of AI on humanity.\n\nHe also said it was time to move on because he was constantly grappling with the perils of AI, bioweapons, and a \"whole series of interconnected crises unfolding at this very moment.\"\n\n\"We appear to be approaching a threshold where our wisdom must grow in equal measure to our capacity to affect the world, lest we face the consequences,\" he wrote.\n\nHe added: \"Throughout my time here, I've repeatedly seen how hard it is to truly let our values govern our actions. I've seen this within myself, within the organization, where we constantly face pressures to set aside what matters most, and throughout the broader society too.\"\n\nSharma said he plans to pursue work aligned with his integrity, explore a degree in poetry, and devote himself to courageous speech.\n\nNeither Sharma nor Anthropic immediately responded to requests for comment from Business Insider.\n\nSharma is the latest Anthropic employee to publicly announce a departure.\n\nHarsh Mehta, who worked in research and development, and leading AI scientist Behnam Neyshabur, said in X posts last week that they'd left Anthropic to \"start something new,\" while praising the company for its talent and strong culture. Dylan Scandinaro, a former AI safety researcher at Anthropic, recently joined OpenAI as its head of preparedness.\n\nAnthropic, meanwhile, has announced other recent hires, including CTO Rahul Patil, who previously served in the same role at Skype, in October.\n\nThe AI company has been in talks to raise a new round of funding that could value Anthropic at $350 billion.\n\nOn Thursday, Anthropic rolled out Claude Opus 4.6, an upgraded model designed to boost office productivity and coding performance, with a larger context window to handle longer documents and more complex work in a single session.\n\nRead Sharma's full letter below.",

    "fullText": "\"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie is begging the public for help as the search for her elderly mother — who authorities believe was taken from her Arizona home — continues into its ninth day.\n\n\"We are at an hour of desperation, and we need your help,\" the famed NBC anchor said in a new Instagram video posted on Monday.\n\nSavannah Guthrie's 84-year-old mom, Nancy Guthrie, was reported missing by her family on February 1 after she was last seen the night before when they dropped her off at home following a dinner.\n\nLocal authorities have said that they believe Nancy Guthrie, who is limited in her mobility and relies on medication, was taken \"against her will\" from her ranch-style home just outside Tucson in the Catalina Foothills.\n\n\"We believe our mom is still out there. We need your help,\" Savannah Guthrie said in the Monday video, calling the situation a \"nightmare.\"\n\nShe added, \"Law enforcement is working tirelessly around the clock trying to bring her home, trying to find her. She was taken, and we don't know where.\"\n\n\"And we need your help, so I'm coming on just to ask you, not just for your prayers, but no matter where you are, even if you're far from Tucson, if you see anything, you hear anything, if there's anything at all that seems strange to you, that you report to law enforcement,\" Savannah Guthrie said.\n\nThe FBI, which is assisting in the investigation, is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.\n\nNancy Guthrie's disappearance has garnered national attention and has led to ransom notes being sent to local and national media outlets, which the authorities have been investigating. Last week, however, the FBI arrested a California man over a bogus ransom demand that was sent to Guthrie's family.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny's halftime show was the real star of Super Bowl Sunday. I caught his performance from the stands of Levi's Stadium.",
    "fullText": "\"Look for us on TV!\" I told my parents before my fiancé and I headed to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, for our very first Super Bowl.\n\n\"Oh, we're not going to watch the game,\" they replied. \"But can you text us before Bad Bunny comes on?\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl halftime show might have been even more anticipated than the Big Game. And after a lackluster performance from the New England Patriots against the Seattle Seahawks, it was clear that the real star of Sunday was Bad Bunny.\n\nHere's what it was like to watch his halftime show from the Super Bowl stands.\n\nWe got a sneak peek at Bad Bunny's set as we watched people wheel out carts with tall tufts of grass, a nod to the sugarcane fields of his native Puerto Rico.\n\nI assumed the extras were going to dance, but they were actually added to accommodate rules for protecting the natural grass at Levi's Stadium.\n\nBruce Rodgers, who has produced the Super Bowl halftime show for the past two decades with his company Tribe Inc., told Wired that the NFL limited how many carts could be wheeled out onto the football field. So the team decided to dress up performers to help re-create the lush greenery of Vega Baja, Bad Bunny's hometown.\n\nAndrew Athias, one of the extras, told Business Insider that the grass costume weighed 40 pounds. He flew to California from the East Coast and spent two weeks in rehearsals to be part of the field cast.\n\n\"I got paid $18.70 per hour for the gig, but I would've done it for free,\" he said.\n\nDraped across every seat in the stadium was a football necklace with a lanyard decorated with Bad Bunny's name.\n\nOur necklaces automatically lit up during the performance, providing the glow you could see during the halftime show telecast.\n\nLa Casita, a major stage piece from Bad Bunny's \"No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí\" residency, arrived at the end zone for the Super Bowl halftime show — just not the one we were behind!\n\nStill, the excitement was palpable as Bad Bunny kicked off his 15-minute performance with \"Tití Me Preguntó.\" One guy in front of me even started FaceTiming his friend, holding the phone so she could watch the entire show.\n\nBad Bunny walked through the tall grass, passing by various set pieces that paid homage to Puerto Rico — including stands selling Coco Frio and piraguas — at the start of his performance.\n\nFrom the stands above, all we could see were the tops of the grass. However, a jumbotron directly across from our seats showed us what fans at home were seeing on their TV screens.\n\nEveryone around me was confused when the jumbotron in front of us kept cutting away from Bad Bunny to show random images, including some leaves and a cityscape.\n\nPeople quickly realized that the screen behind us was still showing the halftime show, so we wondered if the stock images were due to a technical issue.\n\nWhen I rewatched the show at home, I noticed our jumbotron was often visible on camera. I'm not an expert in production design, but I figure the decision might have been made to make it look less distracting in the telecast.\n\nI found out that stars including Cardi B, Alix Earle, Pedro Pascal, and Jessica Alba made a quick surprise cameo during the halftime show, thanks to excited texts from my friends who were watching from home.\n\nLady Gaga was also a total surprise for the fans in the stands, and I just about lost it when she appeared to sing a salsa version of \"Die With a Smile.\"\n\nAlas, I have no pictures of this moment because I was too busy crying tears of joy.\n\nWatching the couple say \"I do\" from the stands was a quick but special part of the show, especially when it was later revealed via ESPN that the couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to their wedding — only for him to invite them to get married during his Super Bowl performance instead.\n\n\"The only thing more powerful than hate is love,\" the sign read, evoking Bad Bunny's statement during his Grammys acceptance speech the week prior.\n\nThe stadium erupted as Bad Bunny began singing \"DTMF,\" his message emblazoned for all to see — no matter where we were sitting.\n\nAs fireworks lit up California's slowly darkening blue sky, I knew I had just watched something historic.",

    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has again done what the rest of the US military has repeatedly failed to do with its finances — account for its money.\n\nThe Corps, the only US military service to pass a clean financial audit, announced its third successful audit on Monday.\n\nThe Department of Defense, which was recently authorized to receive a new annual budget of nearly $840 billion a year and could see a substantial increase to $1.5 trillion under the current Trump administration, has consistently failed to pass an audit since audits became legally required for the military in 2018.\n\nPentagon officials hope the military can get its books in order across the services and pass one by 2028.\n\n\"The Marine Corps' audit process enabled accurate global tracking and reporting of financial transactions, inventory of facilities, equipment and assets, and accounting for taxpayer dollars spent during the last fiscal year,\" read a Marine Corps release, \"The auditors also tested the Marine Corps' network, key business systems, and internal controls.\"\n\nThe result reflects years of effort to modernize financial and logistics systems that have long been siloed across units, making audits agonizingly challenging, said Lt. Gen. James Adams III, the deputy commandant for programs and resources, during a media roundtable. Such bottlenecks have been a long-standing problem across the Defense Department and are a major focus of Pentagon reforms.\n\n\"We want to modernize our systems so they're digitally connected, so that we can do audits in the future that are controls-based,\" said Adams, who is set to depart his position soon to lead the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nHistorically, fragmented military networks have made everything from force-wide equipment tracking to financial oversight difficult, requiring tedious manual reconciliations. While the Corps still relies heavily on human review, officials say automation and artificial intelligence are already reducing the burden.\n\n\"Right now, we still take a lot of data and move it onto a macro spreadsheet that our accountants are reviewing, and that's just a lot of work,\" said Edward Gardiner, the assistant deputy commandant for programs and resources. AI tools can help flag discrepancies and pinpoint errors, he said. Officials pointed to one automation system that saved 20,000 hours of painful reconciliation work.\n\nAuditors still found seven \"areas of weakness\" in the audit, a common feature even among organizations with clean audits, though Adams told reporters the Corps has prioritized fixes to those areas that pose the greatest risk to financial accuracy after its audits, rather than trying to eliminate all concerns at once.\n\n\"Passing our third consecutive audit is a direct reflection of who we are as Marines,\" the Corps' commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, said in a statement. \"Discipline, accountability, and stewardship are not administrative tasks; they are part of our warfighting culture.\"",

During his time on the team, Jegannathan worked to incorporate more AI tools in sales and service team workflows, five people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\n\"A comprehensive end-to-end understanding of the business has been essential—enabling the team to harness AI effectively to achieve meaningful outcomes across products and customer support,\" Jegannathan wrote on LinkedIn on Monday.\n\nThe executive, who reported directly to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left the company over the weekend, a person with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider. Jegannathan has not been active on internal company systems since late January, and he has not worked closely with the sales team for a few months, people with knowledge of the issue said.\n\nPrior to taking over leadership of the sales team, Jegannathan worked in engineering and IT, rather than sales. He has worked at Tesla for over 13 years. Shortly after he took the reins, he became known for responding to sales and service requests on X.\n\nJegannathan has led the company through a tumultuous sales period. Tesla reported in January that its delivery numbers fell for the second year in a row. The carmaker reported a 16% year-over-year decline in deliveries during the quarter. Jegannathan led the sales efforts while Musk worked with the federal government as a part of the Department of Government Efficiency, before the organization was dismantled.\n\nSeveral of Musk's direct reports have left the company over the past year. One of Musk's top lieutenants, Omead Afshar, parted ways with the carmaker in June, and Milan Kovac, the head of Tesla's robotics division, left the company that same month.\n\nTesla and Jegannathan did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,\" Trump added.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is expected to be completed in early 2026 and has been under construction since 2018. The $6.4 billion project is entirely funded by Canada's Federal government, and will feature six lanes and a pedestrian and cycling path.\n\nThe University of Windsor's Cross-Border Institute estimated in a 2021 study that the new route will save about 850,000 hours a year for trucks, which would mean billions of dollars in savings over the bridge's lifetime.

    "description": "One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consume...",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consumer advocates and Democrats now estimate have cost Americans at least $19 billion in financial relief.\n\nIn a report provided to The Associated Press ahead of its release by the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday, the authors say the CFPB harmed consumers by abandoning major consumer protections, stalling investigation and dismissing a number of lawsuits.\n\n“Trump’s attempt to sideline the CFPB has cost families billions of dollars over the last year alone,” said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, as well as one of the bureau’s fiercest defenders in Congress.\n\nThe administration and congressional Republicans have argued that the bureau needed to be downsized and reined in because it had grown too large and overreaching.\n\nThe administration assumed control of the CFPB in February 2025 after Rohit Chopra, the bureau’s director under President Joe Biden, resigned, leaving White House budget director Russell Vought as acting director. Since then, few new investigations have been opened, many employees have been ordered not to work and several pending enforcement actions against financial companies have been dropped.\n\nThe White House announced in April that it wanted to reduce the Bureau’s staff from 1,689 positions to 207 positions, but that move has been blocked by courts. Even if the employees’ union does succeed in its lawsuit against Vought, Congress cut the bureau’s budget by roughly half in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It’s unlikely that all of those employees will still have their jobs once all litigation is settled.\n\n“The CFPB may still be standing, but it’s essentially on life support,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director at Consumer Reports, in a statement. Consumer Reports put out its own data Monday that arrives at similar conclusions as Warren's office.\n\nA spokeswoman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne form of relief the report said consumers were denied was a limit on overdraft fees, which the Biden CFPB finalized in 2024 but the Republican-led Congress overturned last year. That would have saved consumers $5 billion a year, according to the Bureau’s estimates at the time.\n\nThe bureau also tried to cap the amount of money consumers pay to credit card companies when they pay their bills late. That would have saved Americans roughly $10 billion, according to Bureau estimates when the rule was proposed. The regulation was blocked by a federal court last year, and the bureau, under the control of the Trump administration, decided not to fight the lawsuit in court.\n\nAnother roughly $4 billion in consumer relief would have come from a series of lawsuits or settlements that were dismissed by the bureau under Acting Director Vought. For example, the bureau sued Capital One in January 2025 for $2 billion, days before President Trump was to be sworn into office, alleging that Capital One has misrepresented the interest rate paid on its savings accounts to customers. That lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nThe bureau also sued Early Warning Systems, the company that runs the money transfer service Zelle, in December 2024 for $870 million alleging that the EWS and the banks that operate Zelle were negligent in protecting consumers from fraud and scams. That lawsuit was also dismissed last year.\n\nThere's also been a slowdown in the number of complaints resolved by the bureau as well. The CFPB runs its own consumer complaint database, where a consumer can allege wrongdoing by their bank or financial services company and the bureau will act as intermediary between the consumer and financial company to resolve the complaint. Under the Biden CFPB, roughly half of all consumer complaints were resolved with relief for the consumer, whereas under the Trump CFPB, that figure has dwindled to less than 5%.\n\nThe independent Government Accountability Office made public a separate report Monday outlining its attempts to keep track of the Trump administration’s reorganization and restructuring of the CFPB. The GAO said it received no cooperation from the White House or the bureau, and the GAO needed to rely on mostly public records to produce its report. In a response to the GAO, the CFPB cited ongoing litigation between its employees and management as the primary reason why it could not cooperate.\n\nThe GAO’s report largely matches what has been documented in news reports that the bureau has cancelled dozens of enforcement actions against alleged wrongdoers, unwound rules and regulations that previous bureau management said would protect consumers or bring them financial relief. There have been even rules and regulations enacted during President Trump’s first term that have been targeted by the bureau’s current management.\n\nMark Paoletta, the bureau's chief legal officer and effectively its deputy director under Vought, called the GAO’s report “biased and flawed” in a letter to the agency did not raise any specific issues with its conclusions, other than to say the GAO was working with incomplete information.",

    "fullText": "California still has it over Texas in at least one key way, Elon Musk says: Hiring.\n\nAfter moving the headquarters of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. to Texas in recent years because of politics, he said it’s still easier to recruit employees to work in California. With one exception.\n\n“Austin, it helps,” Musk said — while noting that Tesla still has most of its engineering capacity in California. “Getting engineers to move … I call it the significant other problem.”\n\nThat’s what makes engineering recruiting toughest at Starbase, the remote South Texas outpost where SpaceX is developing its Starship mega-rocket.\n\n“For Starbase that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low,” Musk said. “It’s quite difficult. It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The general counsel for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Monday warned the attorney for an anonymous government employee not to directly share a top-secret complaint about Gabbard's handling of classified material with members of Congress.\n\nThe letter to attorney Andrew Bakaj is the latest escalation in the back-and-forth accusations over the classified complaint, which alleges that Gabbard withheld top-secret material for political reasons.\n\nTwo inspectors general for the intelligence community reviewed the claim and found that particular allegation did not appear to be credible. Gabbard has denied any wrongdoing and said she did all she could to ensure the report reached Congress.\n\nDemocrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees have blasted Gabbard's office over the handling of the complaint, questioning why it took eight months for it to be sent to select members of Congress as required by law.\n\nHere's what to know about the complaint and the next steps:\n\nWhat is known about the complaint\n\nThe anonymous author of the complaint works for a U.S. intelligence agency and in May filed a report claiming that Gabbard withheld classified information for political reasons. Gabbard oversees the coordination of 18 intelligence agencies.\n\nThe complaint made two allegations, according to a memo sent to lawmakers by the current inspector general, Christopher Fox: The first is that the “distribution of a highly classified intelligence report was restricted for political purposes,” while the second accuses Gabbard's general counsel of failing to report a potential crime to the Justice Department.\n\nIn June, the inspector general at the time, Tamara Johnson, found that the claim Gabbard distributed classified information along political lines did not appear to be credible, Fox said in the memo to lawmakers. Johnson was “unable to assess the apparent credibility” of the accusation about the general counsel’s office, Fox wrote.\n\nThe watchdog said he would have deemed the complaint non-urgent, meaning it never would have been referred to lawmakers.\n\n“If the same or similar matter came before me today, I would likely determine that the allegations do not meet the statutory definition of ‘urgent concern,’” Fox wrote.\n\nThe New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported that the complaint stemmed from a call between two foreign nationals that mentioned someone close to President Donald Trump and was intercepted by the National Security Agency. The news reports, which cited anonymous sources, said the discussion involved Iran and that Gabbard notified the White House personally, while the complaint accused her of blocking the NSA from reporting the interaction to other agencies. The AP could not immediately confirm the reports.\n\nThe NSA declined to offer details about the complaint Monday, saying in a statement that it works closely with the FBI and others to investigate the mishandling or disclosure of classified information.\n\nGabbard's office warns attorney\n\nBakaj, a former CIA officer and an attorney for the person making the complaint, offered to meet with certain lawmakers or their staffs to discuss the allegations and his concerns about Gabbard's review.\n\nODNI's general counsel warned against that in its letter Monday, noting that Bakaj or his client could face criminal charges if they improperly revealed classified material during the briefing.\n\n“The highly classified nature of the underlying complaint increases the risk that you or your client inadvertently or otherwise breaks the law by divulging or mishandling classified information,” the general counsel's office wrote. “You may have other means of appearing in front of Congress, but this is not it.”\n\nBakaj did not immediately respond to questions Monday about the letter.\n\nUnder federal law, intelligence whistleblowers are entitled to ask to refer their complaints directly to key lawmakers even if the inspector general finds them non-credible, so long as they deem the allegations urgent. That determination was made by the original watchdog, but the complaint didn’t reach lawmakers until last week.\n\nCopies of the top-secret complaint were hand-delivered beginning last week to the “Gang of Eight” — a group comprised of the House and Senate leaders from both parties as well as the four top lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nAdditional meetings for the remaining members are tentatively set for Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats decry delay as GOP backs Gabbard\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he will push Gabbard for more answers about the underlying complaint and why it took so long to get the report to lawmakers.\n\nThe number of redactions make it hard to evaluate the allegations, he said.\n\n“The fact that this sat out there for six, seven, eight months now and we are only seeing it now, raises huge concerns in and of itself,” Warner said Sunday on CBS' “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe Republicans who lead the intelligence committees are backing Gabbard, making it less likely the panels take further steps to investigate the complaint.\n\n“It seemed like an effort by the president’s critics to undermine him,\" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Senate Intelligence Committee's chairman, wrote Saturday on X.\n\nIntelligence chief responds to critics\n\nGabbard noted in a lengthy social media post Saturday that Johnson was appointed interim inspector general for the intelligence community during President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nShe included a detailed timeline that she said shows she acted quickly to ensure the complaint reached Congress. Gabbard wrote that she was aware of the complaint in June and believed the investigation had ended after it was found non-credible, only for the inspector general’s office to inform her in December that the complaint had to be reviewed, redacted and sent to members of Congress.\n\n“I took immediate action to provide the security guidance to the Intelligence Community Inspector General who then shared the complaint and referenced intelligence with relevant members of Congress last week,” Gabbard wrote.\n\nShe also accused Warner and the media of trying to use the complaint to smear her name.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings under a bill that was signed in September following the summer of high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit in November challenging the laws, arguing that they would threaten the safety of officers who are facing harassment, doxing, and violence and that they violated the constitution because the state is directly regulating the federal government.\n\nJudge Christina Snyder said she issued the initial ruling because the mask ban as it was enacted did not also apply to state law enforcement authorities, discriminating against the federal government. The ruling could have national implications as states grapple with how to deal with federal agents enforcing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nIt left open the possibility to future legislation banning federal agents from wearing masks if it applied to all law enforcement agencies, with Snyder writing \"the Court finds that federal officers can perform their federal functions without wearing masks.” The ruling will go into effect Feb. 19.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill in September banning some law enforcement officers from wearing masks, neck gaiters, and other facial coverings. It was slated to go into effect Jan. 1 but was put on hold due to the lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to exempting state law enforcement officers, it made exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and other situations where not wearing a mask would jeopardize an operation. Snyder sided with the federal government, which argued this exemption was discriminatory against federal agents.\n\nNewsom also signed into law a measure requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job, which was challenged by the federal government but upheld by the judge.\n\nCalifornia State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the original bill to ban facial coverings, said Monday he would immediately introduce new legislation to include state police in the law.\n\n“ICE and Border Patrol are covering their faces to maximize their terror campaign and to insulate themselves from accountability,” Weiner said in a news release. “We will ensure our mask ban can be enforced.”\n\nAt a Jan. 14 hearing, Snyder repeatedly asked the government’s lawyer, Tiberius Davis, to explain why banning masks would impede the federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties, if officers rarely wore masks prior to 2025.\n\nDavis cited claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that there has been a multifold increase in assaults and threats against federal officers. He also brought up an incident in Los Angeles where three women are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.\n\n“There is real deterrence on the officer’s safety and ability to perform their duties,” Davis said.\n\nCameron Bell, California Department of Justice attorney, challenged his claims, saying there was no concrete evidence that federal agents can’t perform their duties without facial coverings.\n\nBell referenced declarations from U.S citizens who have been detained by federal agents but thought they were being kidnapped.\n\n“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” Bell said.\n\nThe federal government also argued in legal briefs that allowing California’s legislation could lead other states to be “emboldened to impose similar unconstitutional restraints.”\n\nDavis cited a statement from Newsom in July 2025 during an interview posted online where he discussed the mask ban bill, saying, “It appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents but we do for other law enforcement authorities.”\n\nLos Angeles County supervisors voted in December to enact a local ordinance banning law enforcement from wearing masks that went into effect Jan. 8. However, the sheriff’s department said it would not enforce the ordinance until after the court ruled on the statewide mask ban. The Los Angeles Police Department had also said it wouldn’t enforce the mask ban.",

    "fullText": "My subscription fatigue is real, but at the end of the day, I do recognize that companies need to make money. If one of them manages to put together a compelling package of features for a reasonable price, I can decide whether or not I find that value worth the money. That's fine. What isn't fine is offering a feature for free for years, and then suddenly deciding to lock it behind a paywall.\n\nIt seems YouTube didn't get that memo. Starting on Saturday, outlets like 9to5Google began reporting that YouTube Music had started to remove the ability to vie lyrics for free users. If you want a full lyrics experience, you'll need to The service hasn't cut these users off cold turkey. According to anecdotal user experiences, YouTube Music is opening lyrics access to free users for five songs per month. Once they play song number six, they'll only have access to the first two lines of each song, as the rest of the lyrics will be blurred out. These users will have to wait until the following month to view another five songs.\n\nThere appears to be no confusion about why the lyrics are blurred out, either. When you switch to the \"Lyrics\" tab on YouTube Music as a free account, a new banner appears, telling you how many views you have remaining. Beneath this, you'll see the option to \"Unlock lyrics with Premium,\" a clear message that, unless you pay up, you only get a limited number of lyrics views. This, apparently, follows a months-long period where YouTube Music tested lyrics as a Premium-only feature.\n\nFor what it's worth, when I tried to see what the current lyrics situation looks like on my free YouTube Music app, the service gave me two weeks of Premium for free, with no option to skip it. That's, um, nice of YouTube, but since I already have an Apple Music subscription, the only real consequence here is that I can't test these new lyrics limitations out.\n\nI don't see the strategy here. Lyrics aren't something I feel people would feel compelled to pay for specifically—but they might be annoyed enough at losing them to look elsewhere. Spotify, for example, offers a full lyrics experience for free users. It was only last week the company added offline lyric downloads for Premium users only, but, even then, that's adding a feature for the subscription tier—not taking away an existing feature from free users.\n\nIt's not just Spotify, either. Other free music streaming services offers lyrics, as well, including Pandora, Amazon Music Free, and Freefy. These are largely radio services, so you may not have as much flexibility as you would have with YouTube Music free—but, hey, you at least have lyrics.\n\nLosing lyrics isn't the end of the world for free YouTube Music users, either. Just about any song's lyrics can be found on the internet. Sometimes, the lyrics show up in a Google search window without you needing to even click a link. Otherwise, sites like Genius and AZLyrics do exist. It's just a bummer YouTube feels the need to gatekeep the in-app experience.",

    "description": "A researcher had free access to messages sent on the app Chat & Ask AI.",
    "fullText": "Have you ever used an application called Chat & Ask AI? If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.\n\nChat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.\n\nThe problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n\nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.",

    "title": "You Can Opt Out of Ads on ChatGPT, but It Might Not Be Worth It",
    "description": "You don't have to see ads in ChatGPT, but you'll get less ChatGPT in return.",
    "fullText": "It finally happened. After months of speculation, ChatGPT officially has ads. OpenAI revealed the news on Monday, announcing that ads would roll out in testing for logged-in adult users on Free and Go subscriptions. If you or your organization pays for ChatGPT, such as with a Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you won't see ads with the bot.\n\nOpenAI says that ads do not have an impact on the answers ChatGPT generates, and that these posts are always clearly separated from ChatGPT's actual responses. In addition, ads are labeled as \"Sponsored.\" That being said, it's not exactly a church-and-state situation here. OpenAI says that it decides which ads to show you based on your current and past chats, as well as your past interactions with ChatGPT ads. If you're asking for help with a dinner recipe, you might get an ad for a meal kit or grocery service.\n\nThe company claims it keeps your chats away from advertisers. The idea, according to the company, is strictly funding-based so that OpenAI can expand ChatGPT access to more users. That's reportedly why ads are starting as a test, not a hardcoded feature: OpenAI says it wants to \"learn, listen, and make sure [it gets] the experience right.\" As such, advertisers don't have access to chats, chat histories, memories, or your personal details. They do have access to aggregate information about ad performance, including views and click metrics.\n\nOpenAI will only show ads to adults. If the service detects that you are under 18, it will block ads from populating in your chats. Ads also will not appear if you're talking to ChatGPT about something related to health, medicine, or politics. You can offer OpenAI feedback on the ads you do see, which should inform the ads you receive in the future. You can also delete your ad data and manage ad personalization, if you want to reset the information OpenAI is using to send you ads.\n\nThe thing is, you don't actually have to deal with ads, even if you use ChatGPT for free. That's not just by upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan, though OpenAI does suggest that option in its announcement. In addition, OpenAI is offering Free and Go users a dedicated choice to opt out of ads here. There is, of course, a pretty sizable catch: You have to agree to fewer daily free messages with ChatGPT. OpenAI doesn't offer specifics here, so it's not clear how limited the ad-free experience will be. But if you hate ads, or if you simply don't want to see an ad for something irrelevant to your ChatGPT conversation, it's an option.\n\nIf you like that trade-off, here's how to opt out of ads. Open ChatGPT, then head to your profile, which opens your profile's Settings page. Here, scroll down to \"Ads controls,\" then choose \"Change plan to go ad-free.\" Select \"Reduce message limits,\" and ChatGPT will confirm ads are off for your account. You can return to this page at any time to turn ads back on and restore your message limits.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

Instead, they were \"messing around with login pages,\" specifically Google login pages, when they found that the sites' HTML source code could see the passwords they entered in plain text. They turned their sights onto other websites—more than 7,000, reportedly—and found that about 15% of them were also storing sensitive information in plain text. That's over 1,000 websites exposing important data.\n\nThat, of course, is not supposed to happen: When you enter sensitive data into a website—say, your password into Google's login page—that site shouldn't see your password at all. In short, the sites confirm your passwords through hashing algorithms—essentially, jumbling your password into a code that can be checked against the code the site stores on their end. They can then confirm you entered the right password without ever exposing the actual text. By storing things like passwords and Social Security numbers in plain text, those sites are exposing that data to anyone in the know.\n\nImportantly, that includes browser extensions. The researchers claim that 17,300 Chrome extensions—or 12.5% of the extensions available for download on Google's browser—have the permissions they need to view this sensitive plain text data. Think about the permissions you ignore when setting up a new extension, including permissions that give extensions full access to see and change what you enter on a webpage. Researchers didn't expose any extensions by name, as the situation is not necessarily the fault of the extensions, but considering the scope, it's possible some of the extensions you use can access sensitive information you enter in certain sites.\n\nAgain, legitimate extensions are not the priority: Instead, it's the risk that a developer will create an extension with the intent of scraping sensitive info stored in plain text. While the researchers claim there are no extensions actively abusing this vulnerability yet, this isn't a theoretical problem. Researchers created an extension from scratch that could pull this user data, uploaded it to the Chrome Web Store, and got it approved. They took it down immediately, but proved it's possible for a hacker to get such a malicious extension on the official store. Even if the hacker didn't make the extension, they could acquire a legitimate extension with an existing user base, adjust the code to take advantage of the vulnerability, and spring the updated extension on unsuspecting users. It happens all the time, and not just on Chrome.\n\nUnfortunately, there's little you can do to prevent these sites from storing your passwords, credit cards, and Social Security numbers in plain text. The hope is, following these discoveries, websites will improve their security and kill the vulnerabilities on their end. But that's on them, not you.\n\nThere are some steps you can take to mitigate the damage, however. First, make sure to limit your use of browser extensions. The fewer extensions you use, the less likely it is you'll use a malicious one. Use only extensions you fully trust, and frequently check in on updates. If the extension changes hands to a new developer, vet that new owner before continuing to use it. You could even disable your extensions when sharing sensitive information with websites. If you need to provide your Social Security number on an official web form, for example, you could disable your extensions to prevent them from reading the data.\n\nYou can also limit the data you share that could stored in plain text. If given the option, use passkeys instead of passwords, as passkeys don't actually use any plain text data that hackers could steal. Similarly, use secure payment systems, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay, which don't actually share your credit card information with the website you're making a payment on. The name of the game is to avoiding typing out your sensitive details unless absolutely necessary—and then, reducing the parties who can see those details.",

    "fullText": "Communications minister Anika Wells points to media reports alleging children can access spaces meant for adults which include explicit sexual content\n\nFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updates\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nReports of child grooming and vile content on popular game service Roblox has “alarmed” the communications minister, Anika Wells, who has demanded the platform explain how it is addressing sexual and self-harm material, and that its PG rating be examined by the Australian Classification Board.\n\nThe eSafety commissioner has also written to the game platform, saying it plans to test the promises it made about keeping children safe online, including disabling chat features and making underage accounts private.\n\n“We remain highly concerned by ongoing reports regarding the exploitation of children on the Roblox service, and exposure to harmful material,” the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said.\n\nRoblox has come under scrutiny after reports that children can be exposed to inappropriate content on the platform, which allows users to create their own mini-games inside the system.\n\nGuardian Australia published a report last November documenting a week of virtual sexual harassment and violence. While playing as an eight-year-old girl, the reporter was given a sexualised avatar, cyberbullied, aggressively killed, sexually assaulted and shat on – all with parental control settings in place.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nWhile platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Kick were included in Australia’s under-16s social media ban, gaming sites such as Roblox were not.\n\nWells and her department were investigating other levers to regulate services such as Roblox.\n\nThe minister has written to Roblox requesting an urgent meeting, saying she was “alarmed by reports of children being exposed to graphic and gratuitous user-generated content on the platform, including sexually explicit and suicidal material”.\n\n“Even more disturbing are ongoing reports and concerns about children being approached and groomed by predators, who actively seek to exploit their curiosity and innocence,” she said in the letter.\n\nGuardian Australia understands Roblox has not yet responded to the letter. In a statement on Tuesday, a Roblox spokesperson said it was committed to keeping users safe, saying it had recently rolled out features like age checking systems, and was working with Australian law enforcement to keep users safe.\n\n“We look forward to the opportunity to inform the minister of the steps we take to help keep our community safe. Roblox has robust safety policies and processes to help protect users that go beyond many other platforms, and advanced safeguards that monitor for harmful content and communications,” they said.\n\n“While no system is perfect, our commitment to safety never ends, and we continue to strengthen protections to help keep users safe.”\n\nIn her letter, Wells pointed to media reports alleging children can access spaces on the game meant for adults which include explicit sexual content, and charges laid against a Queensland man accused of grooming hundreds of children on platforms such as Roblox, Fortnite and Snapchat.\n\nWells has also asked the eSafety commissioner about any short-term measures that could be taken, and separately has written to the classification board to ask if Roblox’s PG rating remains appropriate.\n\nIn the letter to Roblox, Wells noted the company had worked with the eSafety commissioner on additional safety measures for children but that issues appeared to continue.\n\n“This is untenable, and these issues are of deep concern to many Australians parents and carers,” she wrote, saying she was keen to hear what Roblox was doing to prevent adults contacting children, and to protect children from inappropriate experiences.\n\nThe eSafety office said it had also written to Roblox last week, saying it planned to test how the platform was complying with commitments such as making under-16s private by default, new tools to prevent adult users from contacting children and restricting chat features. After that testing, eSafety foreshadowed it “may take further action under the Online Safety Act”.\n\n“I welcome the minister for communications’ correspondence and the Australian government’s support on this important issue as we use all of the tools available to us to keep Australian kids safe online,” Inman Grant said.",

    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Head coach Andy Farrell has largely been a loyal selector throughout his Ireland tenure but will last week's heavy loss in Paris lead to changes for Italy in Dublin on Saturday?",
    "fullText": "When Andy Farrell took charge of Ireland after the 2019 World Cup, Joe Schmidt's erstwhile defensive specialist faced calls to radically overhaul a team that had clearly dropped from a considerable peak.\n\nIn 2018, Ireland had won a Six Nations Grand Slam and beaten New Zealand in Dublin as part of an autumn clean sweep.\n\nThen, having been the head coach in waiting for a year, there was a feeling that Farrell's association with the previous ticket got his tenure started on the back foot.\n\nYet, by the time of his first game in charge in February 2020, Farrell resisted any temptation to enforce a major break from the Schmidt regime, his biggest selection calls revolving around replacing retired veterans Rob Kearney and Rory Best.\n\nWhile handing an international debut to Caelan Doris was a nod to the future, the naming of the then 34-year-old Johnny Sexton as his captain was a clear indication of a focus on the here and now.\n\nAs Ireland muddled through a pair of third-place Six Nations campaigns disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Farrell remained steadfast in his approach of evolution rather than revolution and was rewarded for his faith with a historic series win in New Zealand in 2022 and a Six Nations Grand Slam the next year.\n\nIn the wake of Thursday's humbling defeat by France in Paris to start the 2026 Six Nations however, Farrell has faced the strongest calls since those earliest days of his tenure to dramatically overhaul the team.\n\nWith Italy in Dublin on Saturday afternoon, will the head coach stick or twist?\n\nSaturday, 14 February, 14:10 GMT\n\nListen to full match commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra 2, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Sport website and app alongside live text commentary\n\nWhile Farrell was accurate when judging his 2020-21 squad as one in transition rather than terminal decline, the mood music around the team feels even more sombre this time around.\n\nIt may only be two years ago that Ireland were chasing the history of back-to-back Grand Slams, but Thursday's loss saw them drop to fifth in the world rankings and they have lost seven of their past nine against the teams above them.\n\nWith the four most recent of those reverses coming by double-digits, Thursday was no isolated incident. It is undeniable that a gap to the world's best has emerged and now widened.\n\nFarrell has always shown himself not to be one to throw the baby out with the bathwater but, whether it be seeking an injection of fresh blood, the heralding of a new direction or simply to prompt a reaction to their Parisian lack of \"intent\", it is clear he has some big selection calls to make before Thursday's team announcement to face the Azzurri.\n\nTo an extent, Farrell had already shaken up his team coming into this championship even when already without Andrew Porter, Tadhg Furlong, Mack Hansen, Hugo Keenan and Robbie Henshaw through injury, while Bundee Aki was suspended.\n\nJacob Stockdale was preferred to James Lowe while, with Tadhg Beirne selected in the second row, the selection of Cian Prendergast ostensibly came at the expense of the benched James Ryan.\n\nLeaving two British and Irish Lions out of the side would once have been viewed as a dramatic shift but the events of Thursday night mean that even some once seemingly cemented places in the side are up for fresh debate.\n\nDespite only playing half an hour at the Stade de France, back row Nick Timoney was arguably Ireland's most impactful player in Paris.\n\nThe Ulster back row's international career is perhaps indicative of how settled Ireland's team has become.\n\nHe made his debut against USA in the summer of 2021 but, before his subsequent role off the bench against France, his next five caps were spread across four and a half years and came against Argentina, as a match-day morning inclusion, Fiji, Georgia, Japan and Australia.\n\nAll through that period, he was consistently among the best and most consistent performers for his province and on Thursday gave the impression of a man who had been impatiently waiting for his first crack at the Six Nations and top-level international opposition.\n\nWhile capable of playing across the back row, it will be Josh van der Flier feeling the pressure at number seven.\n\nAlready 30, Timoney is only two years younger than the 2022 World Player of the Year, but with Van der Flier struggling for his best form this season, it would certainly be a selection for the here and now.\n\nThere is little doubt that Joe McCarthy has a long future in the Ireland engine room.\n\nJust 24 years old, he has a profile that is rare in Irish rugby, providing a real combination of physicality and athleticism in the second row. Indeed, having established himself as a starter only after the 2023 World Cup, he is among the most recent additions to Farrell's starting XV.\n\nHowever, as a penalty concession for coming in at the side straight in front of the posts and right in front of the referee on Thursday shows, his decision-making and discipline remain a major work-on.\n\nIt was only last year, after the reverse fixture in the Six Nations, that the Ireland camp were publicly talking about how the Leinster player would learn from his costly yellow card for pulling back Thomas Ramos.\n\nWhen Ireland were at their best, such transgressions were simply not tolerated.\n\nIn Munster's uncapped Edwin Edogbo, Farrell now has an alternative who could bring similar physical presence to the side and the 23-year-old has shown good form for his province since returning for injury too.\n\nPairing the two together feels like Ireland's future in the position, but Edogbo over McCarthy for Saturday would give the side's most exciting prospect an international bow and offer a reminder of the required standards in a side who have struggled with discipline this season.\n\nFive talking points from Six Nations opening round\n\nLike Van der Flier, Garry Ringrose is a player who has not found his best form after returning from the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia without a Test cap.\n\nThe Leinster centre was arguably the most unfortunate to miss out on facing the Wallabies, admirably self-reporting symptoms of concussion when he had been selected for the second Test.\n\nSo long a key defensive cog for Ireland, despite being at the centre of a debate on the value of missed tackles statistics, the 31-year-old was hardly alone in looking off the pace in Paris but midfield is definitely an area where the side would benefit from experimenting with younger options.\n\nRingrose, Stuart McCloskey, Henshaw, Aki and even the side's most recent debutant Tom Farrell, are all the wrong side of 30 with the next World Cup still one year and eight months away.\n\nJude Postlethwaite was not even in the senior squad until news broke of Aki's impending suspension but he certainly impressed earlier this season for Ulster.\n\nA run against Italy, alongside his provincial colleague McCloskey in midfield, would be an interesting test of his international credentials.\n\nWard rejoins Ireland squad as Furlong nears return\n\n'Scrutiny and pressure on Irish has reached new level'\n\nIreland must 'stop rot' after Paris humbling",

    "description": "Formula 1 design legend Adrian Newey says Aston Martin's new car is \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.",
    "fullText": "Formula 1 design legend Adrian Newey says Aston Martin's new car is \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.\n\nNewey's comments came as Aston Martin launched their new season on Monday, in a lavish event in Saudi Arabia that was afflicted by technical problems and revealed only the colour scheme on a generic 2026 car, not the team's new design.\n\nThat was waiting across the King Fahd Causeway at the Bahrain International Circuit, where the second pre-season test begins on Wednesday.\n\nNewey, who joined Aston Martin as managing technical partner in March last year, told BBC Sport: \"It seems to be a bit different to some of the other solutions out there.\n\n\"A bit like 2022, there's a new set of aerodynamic regulations, there's been lots of different interpretations. Whether it's the right one or the wrong one, only time will tell.\"\n\nRivals have expressed admiration for the new Aston Martin, which tested in an all-black livery for just one of the permitted three days in the so-called 'shakedown' test in Spain last month.\n\nNewey admitted that the car was not painted there partly because it was ready so late that the team had not had time to do so.\n\nTeams were allowed to run for three of five days in a week at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, but the Aston Martin was ready in time to go out only late on the fourth afternoon, when it broke down after four laps with Lance Stroll at the wheel. Fernando Alonso then ran for just over 60 laps on the final day of the test.\n\nMercedes driver George Russell, the pre-season championship favourite, described it as \"pretty spectacular\" and said it was \"probably the most standout in terms of the car design and it looks very impressive\".\n\nWilliams team principal James Vowles said it was a \"really, really interesting design\".\n\nNewey, who has a reputation for usually being at the leading edge of innovation when new rules are introduced, said: \"Because of the very compressed design time, we decided on a direction, a single direction, that we would pursue. And that is what we've done.\"\n\nNewey joined a team that had already gone through a series of management changes in the past couple of years, while working to bring on stream a new factory, wind tunnel and driver-in-the-loop simulator.\n\nHe said the design process of this year's car, the team's first as Honda's engine partner, had been \"an incredibly compressed cycle\".\n\nHe added: \"Overall it's been very stimulating and invigorating, exhausting at times as well, of course. But what I found was a lot of individually very talented people who weren't necessarily working that well together. And so that's what we've tried to really concentrate on.\"\n\nHe said the team had tried to focus on getting the fundamentals right for the start of the season \"hoping that that will allow us quite a bit of development potential through the season\".\n\nAston Martin chose a design museum in Ithra to unveil the car in its latest colour scheme in an event paid for by their title sponsor, the Saudi Arabian national oil company.\n\nBut the event started nearly 20 minutes late, and the live stream broke after a further five.\n\nTwo-time champion Alonso and Stroll, the son of team owner Lawrence Stroll, will continue as the team's drivers for the fourth consecutive season.\n\nThe team finished seventh in the constructors' championship last year, having been fifth in 2023 and 2024, but are hoping Newey's arrival and taking over from Red Bull as Honda's sole partner will herald the beginning of an era in which they become winners and even world champions.\n\nAlonso will be 45 this summer and is going into the final year of his contract and possibly his last season in F1. He said in a statement: \"The past few years were not easy, but we've learned a lot, and that experience always makes you stronger.\n\n\"Everybody in this team shares the same hunger to be competitive and I have seen how much effort is happening behind the scenes to give us a car we can develop across the season. I'm looking forward to getting on track and developing the car as we head to Bahrain this week.\"\n\nHe added at the launch event: \"Everything combines in a very important season for the team. It always matters where you start in Australia but I feel the second part of the season is going to be even more important.\n\n\"We are very focused on development on the car and as a driver it gives you the feeling you will play an important part through the season.\"\n\nCadillac unveil split livery in Super Bowl advert\n\nNorris confidence 'even higher' as he eyes title defence\n\nBarcelona 'shakedown' offers first hints of F1 2026",

    "description": "Sam Darnold leading the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl glory could just be the greatest redemption story ever in the NFL. We take a closer look.",
    "fullText": "The Sam Darnold redemption story is quite something - from being rated as one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL to Super Bowl champion.\n\nIt's a tale of never giving up, of character, unwavering self-belief and persistence, but also a warning for teams not to write a quarterback off too soon.\n\nAs youngsters being drafted into the NFL are at the mercy of circumstance, not every team will fit every rookie and the sport's history is littered with college stars deemed not good enough.\n\nThey often bounce around from team to team, as Darnold did, but never has one plumbed the depths before managing to rise up and claim the sport's ultimate prize in the ultimate NFL redemption story.\n\nSeahawks beat Patriots to win Super Bowl 60 with crushing defensive display - as it happened\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nSo how bad was Darnold? Well, the numbers were not great, as after being drafted in 2018 he spent three seasons with the New York Jets and two with the Carolina Panthers - during which time he ranked bottom or near the bottom in several areas.\n\nWins were the main one - just 21 of them in five seasons - but categories like passer rating and completion percentage were the worst of any quarterback during that time.\n\nAs a third pick in the draft he was ridiculed for his \"seeing ghosts\" comment as he struggled, and labelled a bust, but now he's getting fitted for a Super Bowl ring it's clear he was only part of the problem.\n\nFellow Jets quarterbacks Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith and Zach Wilson also all finished dead last in passer rating in their first three seasons with the team. Notice a theme?\n\nThat's a quirk of the NFL Draft system, the best players go to the worst teams, and while some could just be having an off season so can build for success, some have serious issues.\n\nAfter Sunday, Darnold has now won 39 games since leaving New York, including serving two years as a back-up - the Jets have won just 26.\n\nThe Panthers have won 15 to Darnold's 31 since leaving Carolina and even the Vikings and 49ers can't match his wins since he departed.\n\nPeople forget that at just 21 he was the youngest NFL starting quarterback since the 1970 merger - perhaps the young man was just in the wrong place after all.\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\n\"Quarterbacks need tonnes of help to allow you to go show how great you can be. If you do not get that help, you are limited in how great you can be,\" said former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and three-time Super Bowl champion Steve Young.\n\n\"And there are not 32 places in the league today that can give you that help.\"\n\nYoung knows when a team is not a good fit, as he was drafted by a poor Tampa Bay squad and won three games in two seasons before leaving to join the 49ers and eventually becoming a Hall of Fame member.\n\nIronically enough it was a largely forgotten season in San Francisco that also provided the catalyst for Darnold to launch the comeback of all comebacks.\n\n\"I didn't play great football the first few years of my career,\" Darnold admitted after the Super Bowl. \"Then I come here to San Francisco and I think because of that year I was able to learn a tonne. I was able to kind of learn and go to Minnesota and play good football there. I was able to come to Seattle and do the same.\"\n\nWorking in a fully functioning franchise, learning from coach Kyle Shanahan and serving as back-up to Brock Purdy in a Super Bowl saw Darnold head to Minnesota better equipped to succeed.\n\nThe irony of returning to Levi's Stadium for his crowning glory was not lost on him.\n\nA stellar season in Minnesota came after he replaced injured rookie JJ McCarthy, but then more irony in the Vikings opting to stick with the quarterback they drafted saw Darnold move on again.\n\nHe left after massive career highs of 14 wins, over 4,000 yards and 35 touchdowns, but still with question marks after a play-off capitulation against the Rams.\n\nOnce again, he had a point to prove.\n\nQuarterbacks grab all the headlines, for good or bad, but they simply cannot do it all by themselves in this ultimate team sport.\n\nTom Brady regularly had, and needed, a top-10 defence on his side to win Super Bowls, while Patrick Mahomes lost two of them because he was soundly beaten up by opposing defences.\n\nIn Seattle, Darnold found the perfect storm of a team on the up and a defensive head coach assembling a crack unit that would go on to dominate the NFL, needing just a solid quarterback to steer the offence.\n\nHaving the league's leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Super Bowl MVP running back Kenneth Walker also helped, and plenty will say Darnold did not have to do much.\n\nHe became the first quarterback to enjoy successive 14-win seasons with two different teams - only Brady had managed it with one - but still there were questions as he led the league in turnovers, giving the ball away 20 times.\n\nAround 80% of play-off games are won by teams with the fewest turnovers. In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nDarnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.\n\nThe response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.\n\nHe answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.\n\nWas it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.\n\nNo quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.\n\nLuck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.\n\nNone have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

    "fullText": "Serena Williams will be eligible to return to tennis from Sunday, 22 February - but it is unclear if or when the American great will make a comeback.\n\nWilliams' name appeared on the International Tennis Integrity Agency (ITIA) reinstatements list on Monday, meaning she can enter tournaments from the date specified, the organisation confirmed to BBC Sport.\n\nHowever, the 23-time Grand Slam singles champion has not announced an official return after ending her career at the 2022 US Open.\n\nBBC Sport has contacted Williams' agent and the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) for comment.\n\nRetired players can be reinstated and return to sanctioned events once they have made themselves available for out-of-competition drug testing for at least six months.\n\nIn December, the ITIA confirmed to BBC Sport that Williams was back on the list of players registered for the drug testing pool.\n\nOnce a player is in the pool, they must let testers know where they will be for one hour of every day.\n\nHours later, Williams, 44, posted on social media: \"I'm NOT coming back. This wildfire is crazy.\"\n\nShe then refused to rule out a comeback at the end of January, telling the Today Show: \"I don't know, I'm just going to see what happens.\"\n\nInterviewer Savannah Guthrie pushed Williams further, saying \"that's a maybe to me\", and the seven-time Wimbledon singles champion said: \"It's not a maybe.\"\n\nAsked whether she had re-entered the drug testing pool, Williams said: \"I don't know if I was out. Listen, I can't discuss this.\n\n\"If I want to put it [rumours] to bed... listen, I want to go to bed.\"\n\nWilliams previously spoke about using weight-loss drugs in August and appeared in a commercial for the drug during Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam singles champion has never liked the word retirement and instead said she was \"evolving away\" from the sport when she ended her career in New York.\n\nOnly Margaret Court and Novak Djokovic have won more Grand Slam singles titles than Williams.\n\nHer haul of seven Australian Open titles, three French Opens, seven Wimbledons and six US Opens is the most major singles titles by any woman in the Open era.\n\nShe and elder sister Venus, who is still active on the WTA Tour, won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles and three Olympic golds together.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The Puerto Rican artist’s performance was a gleeful rebuke of Trump’s death cult and a celebration of life.\n\nThe past year in Stephen Miller’s America has been unbearably bleak. When masked thugs with “blanket immunity” kidnap 5-year-olds and murder nurses, it tends to darken the national mood. But international mega-star Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) took the stage during the Super Bowl halftime show and gave the best possible response to Miller’s dystopic dreams: a burst of unbridled joy and a dizzying celebration of love, labor, and the power of living our everyday lives despite hardships, all performed in a lyrical language that Miller, in every possible way, lacks the capacity to understand.\n\nPeople should view Bad Bunny’s singular performance as the second part of a political two-step aimed at the white-nativist heart of this racist regime. Part one was a week ago, when, after winning the Grammy for album of the year, Bad Bunny began his acceptance speech by saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say: ICE out!”—to rapturous cheers. It was an ingenious first step, teeing up the halftime show as a future instrument for broadcasting the anti-ICE fervor hitting red and blue states alike.\n\nThen came step two: bringing the technicolor beauty of Puerto Rican culture to the Super Bowl stage. In a time of monsters, Bad Bunny was posing an alternative world: a place where laborers are seen and celebrated, where hurricanes and their victims aren’t forgotten, and where community—not atomization—fuels society. In the swirl of his irrepressible music, sung only in Spanish, and an elaborate set design that conjured the Caribbean in rich and playful detail, Bad Bunny refused to step into our dismal world. Instead, he brought us into his.\n\nI saw the game in a bar, where the people watching around me initially seemed more interested in the halftime show because of the controversy around Bad Bunny’s selection as a performer—the prospect of his Spanish-only music had predictably enraged right-wingers and prompted them to launch a counter halftime show, which spectacularly failed. In 30 seconds, though, many were standing and dancing, everyone locked into every move on the stage. When Ricky Martin came out as a surprise guest, you could feel the room swoon. At the end, everyone rose in an actual ovation.\n\nThe performance was so dense with meaning that, during the fourth quarter, people around me turned to discussing what part of the show they connected with the most—and not only because that was more fun than debating whether the Patriots were going to punt again.\n\nFor me, the most powerful moment was when Bad Bunny name-checked, one after the other, every country in the Americas: a bold, delightfully unsubtle statement against white ethnocentrism and USA puffery. When Bad Bunny said during his Grammy speech, “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans,” the “we are Americans” part had rankled some in immigrant rights circles because it seemed to differentiate the foreign-born. Bad Bunny’s rapid-fire listing—which pointedly did not ignore Cuba or Venezuela—could be seen as a response to that, telling Trump’s cruel regime that “America” is more than just the United States; it’s a region that goes from the top of Canada to the southern tip of Chile. The United States is a part of a community of nations—though it hasn’t been acting like it, instead targeting fishing boats off the coasts of other members of this community and blasting them from the sky like some fascist Death Star.\n\nBad Bunny’s performance will launch a thousand term papers intent on decoding every last moment, including when he gave a Grammy to a young child who had been watching from a staged living room seemingly set in Puerto Rico. Such a scene was particularly resonant knowing that, earlier in January, a 5-year-old boy from Minnesota named Liam Ramos had been abducted from his school by ICE and sent to a Texas detention center. Immediately after the show, people began debating online whether the child on stage was Ramos himself. He wasn’t, but it speaks to how deftly Bad Bunny pulled off his two-step that masses of people thought so.\n\nIn response, of course, Trump had a racist temper tantrum. Perhaps he was offended by a billboard in the background—in English, for his benefit—that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.” For this cowardly regime, it’s now a political act just to acknowledge the cultural power of Puerto Rico, to speak a beautiful language, to sing, and to dance, and to live in peace.\n\nDuring this show of shows, it was difficult to not think about a more serious moment at a recent Bad Bunny concert in Chile. There, the artist led the crowd in a song by legendary Chilean folksinger Victor Jara, who was something like the Bob Dylan of Chile, and whose songs of protest were known around the world. Shortly after the 1973 coup, Augusto Pinochet’s thugs mutilated his guitar-playing hands before the dictator had him publicly executed. Perhaps Jara’s most famous song was “El Derecho de Vivir en la Paz.” Bad Bunny had the entire crowd singing this 60-year-old song. For those who don’t know what it means, the title translates to “The Right to Live in Peace.”\n\nOne of Pinochet’s early orders was to paint over the vibrant, revolutionary murals of Chile, covering them in gray. Bad Bunny’s performance was an act of protest against such repression. It was the revenge of the muralistas. And not a moment too soon.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Members of Congress have a constitutional duty to remove this gangster from office.\n\nBruce Springsteen used the first great protest song of 2026, his “Streets of Minneapolis,” to deliver a blistering condemnation of the violent assault that a strike force of 3,000 masked and armed agents of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has waged on Minnesota’s largest city. The American bard describes how, during the first weeks of January, Minneapolis became “a city aflame…’neath an occupier’s boots” and recounts that “there were bloody footprints where mercy should have stood and two left to die on snow-filled streets: Alex Pretti and Renee Good.” Springsteen was not merely mourning; he was calling out the Trump administration’s propagandistic distortion of the truth about Pretti, an intensive-­care nurse with the Department of Veterans Affairs, gunned down by Border Patrol agents on January 24, and Good, a poet and mother of three, shot in the head by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on January 7. And the Boss excoriated “Noem’s dirty lies.”\n\nThe lies told by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, including wildly unfounded assertions that Good and Pretti committed acts of “domestic terrorism,” have inspired widespread demands for accountability for the most dangerously dishonest of Donald Trump’s miserable cast of cabinet appointees. There is plenty of competition for the “worst of the worst” title in Trump’s cabinet. But Noem’s attempts to defend the indefensible, her personal and official scandals, her mismanagement, and above all her outrageous and propagandistic lies about Good and Pretti are not merely shameful. They are impeachable.\n\nMembers of Congress, no matter their political affiliation, must recognize a constitutional duty to remove this gangster from the position of public trust that she has so flagrantly abused. The will of the people is already clear. Trump and Noem thought they could intimidate the public into quiescence. But tens of thousands of Americans have filled the streets of Minneapolis and cities across the country to demand the abolition of ICE because they have chosen to believe their own eyes, as opposed to Noem’s lies.\n\nThe arguments against Noem are now so stark that even senior Republicans are making the case for her removal, with North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis raging against “the incompetence of the leader of the [Department of] Homeland Security,” adding, “She doesn’t know how to lead, how to de-escalate. She’s exposing ICE officers to dangerous situations; she’s exposing US citizens to deadly situations.” Even as Trump tried to distance himself from some of Noem’s most extreme statements and policies in late January, the president’s response to Tillis and to Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, another Republican who’s said the secretary should go, was to call the senators “losers” and announce that Noem would be staying because “she’s doing a very good job.”\n\nWith Trump digging in, it falls to members of Congress to act. Many Democrats have done just that, as part of the most significant accountability movement yet seen during the year of chaos that Trump and his noxious inner circle of aides, such as Stephen Miller, have unleashed. In addition to tentative calls from Republicans for Noem’s resignation or firing, a robust movement to impeach the cabinet secretary has attracted support from over 180 House Democrats as of February 2. Supporters of impeachment have rallied around a resolution sponsored by Representative Robin Kelly (D-IL) that indicts Noem for obstructing the congressional oversight of detention facilities operated by DHS; for “using her position for personal gain while inappropriately using taxpayer dollars”; for “using her position to circumvent the Federal contracting process and [funnel] Federal funds to her friends’ businesses”; and for “repeatedly [violating] the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and due process rights of American citizens by directing [ICE] to make widespread warrantless arrests, forgo due process, and use violence against United States citizens, lawful residents, and other individuals.”\n\nThe resolution notes that, in the case of Renee Good, “despite video showing the officer on the side of the vehicle while firing and the vehicle was moving away from the officer on the second and third shots, Kristi Lynn Arnold Noem is claiming publicly that the officer was in danger and in front of the vehicle when he fired.” That lie points to the most compelling argument for Noem’s removal: She is a determined propagandist who seeks to distort the truth, undermine investigations, and divide Americans. And all the evidence suggests that she intends to keep lying to the American people, the media, and Congress.\n\nNone of the House members who propose to impeach Noem are naïve. They know that the full constitutional promise of the impeachment power has been undermined by Senate Republicans who have refused to hold members of their own party—including Trump himself—to account. And they know that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will do everything in his power to thwart accountability for Trump and his appointees—just as he did during the fight over the release of files regarding the convicted child-sex offender and longtime Trump associate Jeffrey Epstein. But the anger over Noem’s reckless actions and scorching dishonesty has momentum, which could force congressional action in much the way that US Representatives Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) ultimately did in their fight for the release of the Epstein files.\n\nKhanna has emerged as an ardent supporter of Noem’s impeachment because “she’s presided over agents who are killing American citizens.” The California representative includes Noem’s impeachment on a list of steps that, he says, must be taken to rein in ICE and DHS. “Congress is not powerless. Democrats must unify around an actual agenda,” argues Khanna, who urges opposition to future DHS funding, a repeal of the multiyear $75 billion in funding for ICE that Congress approved last year, investigations and prosecutions of ICE agents who have broken the law, and a strategy to “tear down and replace ICE with an agency that has oversight.”\n\nTo that list, we would add formal action by Congress to bar ICE agents from interfering with the 2026 midterms.\n\nWe understand that some will ask why Noem’s impeachment should be a priority with so many threats to be addressed and so many other members of the Trump administration who merit removal (including Trump himself). Our answer is that this is an accountability movement that has gained traction, has the potential to attract at least some Republican support, and above all will send a message to the whole administration that, to quote Springsteen, “We’ll remember the names of those who died on the streets of Minneapolis”—and the lies that have been told about Renee Good, Alex Pretti, and all the others who have died on Kristi Noem’s watch.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.
