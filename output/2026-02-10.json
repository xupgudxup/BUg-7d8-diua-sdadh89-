Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers are rolling, even if they have made a massive change recently. With James Harden in the fold, it appears that the team is doing much better, as they have a healthy playmaker leading the way on offense.\n\nHarden feels at home with the Cavaliers, which is a good sign of what is to come for Cleveland. He has been a helpful piece for the Cavaliers in his short stint so far, which should be quite promising for their goals of making it far in the postseason.\n\nThe Cavaliers have only played two games with Harden in the lineup, but they look great with the former MVP. He had a near triple-double on Monday against the Denver Nuggets with 22 points, 10 rebounds, and seven assists.\n\nDonovan Mitchell was once again the standout with 32 points and 10 assists. However, Harden also got the most out of Jarrett Allen, who had a monstrous 22 points and 13 rebounds. Harden always gets the most out of his big men, and Allen is not an exception.\n\nMORE:Travis Scott screams after James Harden's Cavaliers debut\n\nWhile he is a new player on the Cavaliers roster, Harden looks like he is at home. Before the season started, Cleveland was projected as a title contender.\n\nNow that Harden is with this team, they could possibly get over the hump. The Cavaliers have had a tough season, but recent weeks have shown they could meet the preseason expectations.\n\n\"We found a way to get it done. This team has a lot of unselfish guys. Donovan gave me the ball multiple times down the stretch and trusted me to make a play. A great group of guys. I’m happy to be a part of it,\" Harden said after beating the Nuggets.\n\nMoving forward, Harden should find his footing in Cleveland. It will be one of the toughest matchups for most teams, as the Cavaliers are ready to meet those title-contender expectations.\n\nCavs' James Harden, Donovan Mitchell made basketball history never done before for Cleveland\n\nCavs' Jarrett Allen is 2nd in NBA history to Wilt Chamberlain in unexpected stat\n\nDonovan Mitchell speaks on the dynamic he is building with new Cavs teammate James Harden\n\nThe Cleveland Cavaliers trade for Keon Ellis was literally 40 years in the making\n\nDaryl Morey throws shade at James Harden after his trade to Cavaliers",

    "fullText": "Cade Cunningham scored 33 points as the Detroit Pistons ended the Charlotte Hornets' nine-game winning streak on Monday with a stormy 110-104 victory overshadowed by a mass brawl that saw four players ejected.\n\nA bruising clash between the Eastern Conference-leading Pistons and the red-hot Hornets erupted into mayhem midway through the third quarter when Charlotte's Moussa Diabate fouled Detroit's Jalen Duren.\n\nDiabate and Duren went forehead-to-forehead, and Duren angrily shoved his opponent away with a hand to the face.\n\nThat was the cue for a melee that saw scuffles and punches being thrown all over the court.\n\nAfter a delay of several minutes, the officiating crew ejected Duren and Detroit team-mate Isaiah Stewart along with Charlotte pair Diabate and Miles Bridges.\n\nStewart had sprinted off the bench to join the fight, attempting to aim a blow at Bridges, who had thrown a punch at Duren as tempers flared.\n\nThere was a further flashpoint in the fourth quarter when Hornets head coach Charles Lee was ejected after reacting furiously at a foul given against his team.\n\nLee needed to be restrained by other members of the Charlotte coaching staff before being led off the court.\n\nLee later praised his team's performance after they went toe-to-toe with the Pistons for long periods of the contest.\n\n\"That was a freaking great game for us,\" Lee said. \"They are the number one team in the East and they bring a level of physicality and competitiveness to them.\n\n\"I think that overall our guys responded to every run that they went on, and all the physicality.\"\n\nAsked about the clash between Diabate and Duren that triggered the fight, Lee said: \"Two guys got in a heated conversation and then it kind of spiraled from there.\"\n\nOf his own ejection in the fourth quarter, Lee added: \"I gotta have a little bit better emotional control in that moment.\"\n\nDetroit coach J.B. Bickerstaff pinned the blame for the flashpoint squarely on Charlotte's players, saying Duren had been defending himself.\n\n\"Our guys deal with a lot right?\" Bickerstaff said. \"But they're not the ones that initiated it... they crossed the line.\n\n\"I hate that it got as ugly as it got. That's not something you ever want to see. But if a guy throws a punch at you, you have a responsibility to protect yourself and that's what happened tonight.\n\n\"Go back and watch the film. They're the ones that initiated crossing the line and our guy had to defend himself.\"\n\nDetroit's victory lifted them to 39-13 at the top of the Eastern Conference standings, clear of the second-placed New York Knicks (34-19). Charlotte remain in 10th place on 25-29.\n\nThere were more ejections elsewhere Monday, with the Minnesota Timberwolves' Naz Reid and Atlanta's Mo Gueye getting tossed during an ugly melee in the fourth quarter of their game, which ended in a 138-116 victory for Minnesota.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the Oklahoma City Thunder improved to 41-13 with a 119-110 defeat of the Lakers. Jalen Williams led the scoring with 23 points for the reigning NBA champions, who were once again missing the injured Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.\n\nIn Denver, Donovan Mitchell finished with 32 points and James Harden added 22 as the Cleveland Cavaliers overcame a triple-double performance from Nikola Jokic to defeat the Nuggets 119-117.\n\nJokic finished with 22 points, 14 rebounds and 11 assists for Denver.\n\nThe Orlando Magic downed the Milwaukee Bucks 118-99 while the Utah Jazz upset the Miami Heat 115-111.\n\nThe Brooklyn Nets (15-37) also scored an upset with a 123-115 defeat of the Chicago Bulls.",

It all happens the next two nights.\n\nA big sign outside of the BMO Center reads “Hockey Lives Here.” It certainly does with the IceHogs, but the Hockey that will live here the next two nights will be much different.\n\nThe AHL All-Star Classic will be held in Rockford for the first time. AHL league staff members have set up headquarters at the Embassy Suites just down the street.\n\nYou’ll notice All-Star banners on the streetlamps near the BMO.\n\nA large TV production truck sits alongside the BMO Center off Main Street. The event will be shown by the NHL Network and by TSN in Canada.\n\nTuesday afternoon starting a four o’clock some of the streets around the BMO will be filled with a block party. But inside is where the biggest action will take place.\n\n48 of the AHL’s best players will be in there. A skills competition will be held Tuesday night at seven o’clock. That will serve as the tune-up for Wednesday night’s All-Star Challenge, a series of six three-on-three round-robin games between the stars.\n\nThe IceHogs have high hopes for this event as IceHogs President of Business Operations told me a year ago when the IceHogs learned that they would host the event.\n\n“We know we’ve got a great fan base,” said Snider. “We know we’ve got a great community behind us. We’ll sell the tickets. We just want to make sure that we are doing the league right, making the city proud, making the community proud. We want to make this the best All-Star Game ever.”\n\nThe block parties Tuesday and Wednesday at 4pm are free to the public, so is the AHL’s Hall of Fame Induction ceremony at the Coronado Theatre Thursday morning at 11.",

It was Gary’s advice to his son that helped Seattle navigate the frenzy of the two weeks before the Super Bowl.\n\n“He said, ‘Put the game plan in a week early — don’t wait until you get there,'” Klint told The Denver Post, standing in the locker room Sunday night. “So we took his advice.”\n\n“Because when you get to the Super Bowl — there’s just so much stuff going on that it’s hard to, like, gameplan,” Klint continued. “You still keep game-planning, but there’s so many distractions.

He was 19-of-38 for 202 yards and a touchdown. The Seahawks also didn’t turn over the ball.\n\n“I would do it 30 times over,” Klint said, on his father’s advice. “We didn’t have a great night on offense — our defense did great.

Chelsea cruised to a 3-0 half time lead against Wolves away from home on Saturday afternoon, but they stumbled a bit \n\nTwo penalties from Cole Palmer in quick succession and then a nice finish in open play within 25 minutes was enough to get that job done though and make the score line look comfortable.\n\nSutton thinks it’s going to be similar tonight.\n\nBBC pundit Chris Sutton with a Chelsea logo. (Photo by Ian MacNicol/Getty Images)\n\nIn words picked up on X this week, Sutton says:\n\n“This game smells of Chelsea revenge to me. The Blues have made a good start under new boss Liam Rosenior, with four wins out of four in the league. Cole Palmer has hit form too, and they should win this fairly comfortably.”\n\nChelsea need to now focus on playing well across 90 minutes in games and not just one half. But a good start to this one will be important as you do not want to allow Leeds to build any confidence or momentum in the game and getting them believing they can do something here and grab all three points.\n\nLiam Rosenior will hope his incredible start at Chelsea can continue tonight.",

    "title": "Haway Sunderland — Let’s Give Liverpool Hell!",
    "description": "Six months ago a win for Sunderland over the Premier League champions would have felt like pure fantasy, but on Wednesday we could actually do it, and go level on points with them. Let’s get stuck in!",
    "fullText": "Given that Sunderland are so very close to their points target from the start of the season, there’s a feeling — certainly from my perspective, anyway — that this game against Liverpool has slightly more riding on it than your usual Premier League outing.\n\nEvery time someone from within the club is asked about targets and achievable goals this season, there is a very clear and concise point made — all that we are focusing on and thinking about is reaching the magic forty-point mark. Right now we’re sat on 36, so we’re close, but we’re not quite there yet.\n\nThe fact that I’m even considering that we could get within touching distance of that with a win over Liverpool on Wednesday night is telling about how each club has performed this season. Arne Slot’s side, who were clearly the best team in the land last season and won the Premier League, are only three points ahead of us in the table. Victory on Wednesday night would put us level with the reigning Champions. An amazing thought.\n\nOf course, nothing is decided in February, and there’s a long way to go, but can you imagine what a win against such a brilliant side would do for our collective confidence heading into a much kinder-looking run of fixtures?\n\nThe daft thing is, I genuinely believe we can do it. Right now, Liverpool are a wounded animal, and they’ll still be hurting after losing to Manchester City on Sunday in a game they really ought to have gotten something from. Their talisman on that evening, Dominik Szoboszlai, is suspended, and there’s a glaring hole in the right-back position that Sunderland really ought to target and exploit. This is a great opportunity to earn a statement-making win over a side that I wouldn’t have dreamed of us beating six months ago.\n\nWe absolutely have to smell blood. Yes, Sunderland are the last remaining unbeaten Premier League home side, and with that comes the pressure to maintain our glittering spell of form, but you have to think that all the pressure is on Liverpool right now. They’ve got no chance of winning the league and retaining their title, but they’re in serious danger of completely blowing their season altogether. What if the unthinkable happens, and they fail to qualify for Europe? It may seem extreme, but it’s certainly possible, and these are the doubts that will be creeping into the minds of their players and coaching staff. I can’t imagine that after such a morale-sapping loss that they’ll be particularly looking forward to travelling up to the north-east on a Wednesday night to play against a team who has nothing to fear.\n\nMany supporters have quite rightly pointed out that there has been a change in the atmosphere at the Stadium of Light in our last two home games, but I just put that down to the fact that we were playing teams that we were expected to beat. That simply won’t be the case on Wednesday, and I think people will be really up for it against Liverpool, a side who may well not be at their best but are still expected to come and beat us. We thrive off being the underdog, and that brings with it a spirit that enables the fans to find an extra level or two, and should create the foundations for an atmosphere within the stadium that could well carry the players over the line to victory.\n\nEvery tackle, every header, every second ball — we must cheer it ferociously. The players have to do their part too and understand what a strong start early doors can do for how the rest of the game plays out from that point. When we win tackles or stick the ball into row Z for a throw-in, I want to see the Lads roaring towards the crowd and throwing up their arms — let’s make sure that Liverpool know that they’re in for a rough night.\n\nThen, who knows? We could be sat here on Thursday morning, proud as punch of yet another excellent Sunderland performance at the Stadium of Light, level on points with last season’s Champions and just one point away from our first huge target of the campaign.\n\nLet’s believe that we can achieve it. Let’s give them hell.",

    "title": "Will Sunderland Remain Unbeaten After Liverpool Clash?",
    "description": "How confident are you that Sunderland will get something on Wednesday and, importantly, maintain our unbeaten home record?",
    "fullText": "‘Doing a Sunderland’ — a ‘thing’ that a lot of people think exists, no longer is a ‘thing’ with this Sunderland side — that’s if it ever was. This is a new team, on a different level to probably any other team we’ve supported before. That being said, what still applies to us and every other team, is the level of psychology and the human effects on the players. I think RLB likes to term this as ‘consistency’. Only the very top teams can approach a game against a lower-league team with the same mentality that they approach a battle with a top-of-the-table rival. I don’t think we’ve reached those levels of consistency at all yet. Look at our away performances against Burnley, Fulham, Brentford and West Ham especially. We switched off. We didn’t give the home team the level of respect and commitment that needs to be given to all Premier teams.\n\nThe problem this Wednesday of course is that we’ve just given every effort against the league leaders, and left everything out on the pitch. But so did Liverpool against Man City. The Reds will be itching to put that right and get back to winning ways at the SoL. So it’s set up for a very intriguing game. I stated last week that I didn’t think we’d take points off Arsenal and Liverpool — especially as these 2 games are so close together. As well as we played at The Emirates, I think if we’d pinched a point, in some psychological throwback, we wouldn’t be approaching the Liverpool game with quite the same hunger or desire. Work that backwards logic out! Because we missed out against the Gunners, and as we are defending our brilliant home record, I think the players will be up for this one yet again, with a point to prove. Liverpool will have to be at it to take our undefeated record off us — bring it on. How we fare against Oxford might be another matter — but for Wednesday, I’m confident we can get something out of the game. Ha’way me bonnie lads!\n\nI think we have every chance of getting a positive result on Wednesday because we have everything to play for.\n\nWhile our Premier League status is not on the line this week, our proud unbeaten home record is something to fight for. Our players have a clear connection with the fans and this will be key to keeping Liverpool at bay.\n\nThe rousing atmosphere has been key in all of our home games so far, and I expect nothing less against a side which, despite a recent dip in form, are still the defending Premier League champions.\n\nWe should be looking to exploit the reds’ defensive woes and perhaps our substitutions later in the game will have an impact, with the likes of Mayenda, Isidor and our new signing Nilson offering us pace and power in reserve.\n\nOur home mentality and influence of the crowd will give our players that extra 10 per cent as we fight to keep our unbeaten run at the SoL going.\n\nLet’s not worry about the Arsenal game or our record away from home. We’re back at the SoL this time and our record at home should give Régis Le Bris and his team plenty of confidence. Ha’way the Lads!\n\nThis is clearly one of the biggest tests for us to maintain our unbeaten home record, but I think it’s feasible we can get a draw, and if we are at our best, we could do a bit better, as at our peak and with the crowd behind us, we can beat anyone at the SoL.\n\nThe concern I have is twofold. Firstly the proximity of these two top-end games, as was the issue with Man City and Liverpool close together in the past. We drew and almost nicked a win at Anfield, but the game at The Etihad was just too much too soon, and this pair of games could be similar.\n\nThe other risk is the personnel we have available after that massive battle against the champions elect. We have showed at home we can play without Xhaka, but the way Noah Sadiki went off at the weekend, if we have also lost him, that could be a tough one to overcome. Hopefully his withdrawal was a precaution and he is back to challenge the Liverpool midfield, part of a team that will be rattled by losing at home as they did in that last 15 mins against Pep’s lads.\n\nThat said, the early difference maker against Man City when they visited Liverpool was Szoboszlai, and after the farcical late red card he took, he will be suspended for our game, so we aren’t the only team without key players.\n\nIf we have Sadiki, Le Fée and Diarra in the middle we can more than compete with Mac Allister and Gravenberch for me.\n\nBrobbey supported by Talbi, Diarra and the interchanging overlap of Hume and Mukiele can get occasional change out of Konaté, Van Dijk and Kerkez. We may even see a bigger contribution from Angulo after a few more days to train and bed in.\n\nI feel sorry for whoever Liverpool draft in to replace the missing Hungarian in all honesty, as Brobbey will be on a mission, and so will the winger on that side I’m sure.\n\nIt will be a tough night, but it’s one I’m coming up for so I can’t wait to see it play out live.\n\nFor perspective, we have to remember this is why we wanted to be here — to pit our wits against some of the best footballers in the world.\n\nAnd to beat the sad bastards from Newcastle.\n\nA year ago, I was excited just to see how we’d fare against a beleaguered Luton after some sketchy home form. This year, the excitement is reaching ridiculous levels as we prepare to welcome the defending champions.\n\nWednesday against Liverpool presents a fascinating challenge. Our home form has been superb, built largely on Régis Le Bris’s (and now my) favourite word: synergy.\n\nIf we can turn the Stadium of Light into a genuine cauldron of noise, I’m certain the players will respond. With the right selection, a fully committed, physical performance, and relentless support, we can protect this unbeaten home record — something that clearly means a great deal to the squad and coaching staff alike. We’re coming off a grueling shift against Arsenal on Saturday, but there’s no doubt this team will leave everything on the pitch.\n\nWe can be under no illusions, though; Liverpool are dangerous for a reason. There’s a world-class clinical edge to them, and the duo of Hugo Ekitiké and Florian Wirtz is a particularly frightening prospect to nullify.\n\nHowever, if we look back to the reverse fixture along with our performances of late, there are plenty of encouraging signs. I’ve been beyond impressed with our midfield’s ability to dictate games, and we can’t dismiss the damage Brian Brobbey can do. His physicality, link-up play, and finishing could be the key to unlocking them.\n\nI’m not going to jinx the result with a score prediction, but I know I’ll leave the ground proud of this side. Let’s keep this run going. Ha’way the lads!\n\nI’d say that going into Wednesday night’s game I’m not confident that we WILL win but I’m confident that we CAN win.\n\nIf this season has shown us anything, it’s that we have no reason to fear anybody at the Stadium of Light. We’ve repelled the current top three in the league and taken 3 points while doing it, so welcoming a disheartened and seemingly flailing Liverpool side doesn’t put the fear into me like it may have before the season started.\n\nThanks to an unbelievable series of events against Manchester City, the holding league champions are down not one, two or three but four right-backs and will likely need to play Curtis Jones in that position — something which is particularly poignant for the visitors after missing out on our very own Lutsharel Geertruida.\n\nWith a stuttering Mo Salah, an injured Isak and an over-reliance on Ekitiké, we could find a way to keep the visitors from breaching our defence and I’d love to see our new lad Angulo given a start against their makeshift defence. He’s got the pace and trickery to make the night a nightmare for any player stepping into that spot.\n\nHopefully we can find a way to break through early as if we get an early goal, this Liverpool team is not made up of the same mentality monsters as in the past and may not be able to get back into it. We nearly won at Anfield so hopefully we can get the job done come Wednesday. Ha’way the lads!",

    "title": "When Advocacy Becomes Ammunition: How Eni Aluko’s Comments Undermine the Women’s Game",
    "description": "Eni Aluko is in the headlines again, and for all the wrong reasons. Do her comments undermine the progress that the women’s game has made over recent years?",
    "fullText": "Eni Aluko’s recent comments hit hardest those women who are already fighting to be heard. Her argument that male pundits are occupying spaces that should belong to women, and that she and other former players with many caps “deserve” those roles, has ignited a backlash not because the subject is off-limits, but because the way she framed it reinforces the very narratives that hold women back.\n\nWomen in sport should be able to disagree, debate, and critique without being painted as disloyal. But when someone with her platform speaks in ways that echo the language traditionally used to undermine women’s sport, the impact is not neutral. It reverberates. It gives ammunition to those who already believe women’s football is fragile, unserious, or undeserving of investment. And it shifts the conversation away from the structural issues that actually need attention.\n\nHer intentions may well be good. She may genuinely believe she is protecting the women’s game. But intention does not erase impact, and the impact here is harmful, especially for players, staff, journalists, and fans who are working relentlessly to build credibility in a landscape that still treats women’s sport as an afterthought. When someone with her influence speaks in ways that mirror the criticisms women already face, it adds weight to the wrong side of the scale. The frustration many women feel is not about disagreement. It’s about the way her comments feed into a wider culture that already demands perfection from women while excusing mediocrity in men. Women in sport are constantly told they must be grateful, quiet, and flawless. They must not complain, must not challenge, must not show vulnerability. They must work twice as hard to be taken half as seriously. And when someone from within the game reinforces those pressures, it becomes even harder to push back against them.\n\nEni Aluko speaks out about the Lionesses Euro 2025 final and the pundits for that game… pic.twitter.com/1vQcKyIZ0s\n\n— george (@StokeyyG2) February 7, 2026\n\nThis is where the damage lies. Not in the existence of critique, but in the way it is delivered, framed, and absorbed by an audience already predisposed to doubt women’s sport. Women’s football is still in a precarious position. It is growing, yes, but growth does not equal stability. Every misstep is magnified. Every controversy is weaponised. Every internal disagreement is treated as evidence that the sport is not ready for investment or attention. When Aluko speaks, she speaks as someone who has been a trailblazer, a former England international, a sporting director, a media figure. Her words carry authority. They shape narratives. They influence how the public, the press, and even decision-makers perceive the women’s game.\n\nHer comments about male pundits occupying space that she believes should belong to women deepen this harm. She argued that men, particularly high-profile ex-players, are taking roles in women’s football coverage that should be reserved for women with lived experience of the game. She went further by suggesting that her own international caps, and those of other retired female players, should entitle them to priority in punditry selection. This framing is flawed. It treats punditry as a zero-sum game rather than a growing space. It implies that men’s presence is inherently harmful, when in reality some of the most impactful advocacy for women’s football has come from male allies whose voices reach audiences women cannot yet reach.\n\nIan Wright is the clearest example. His support for the women’s game has been consistent, vocal, and deeply influential. He has used his platform to amplify women’s football at times when broadcasters barely acknowledged it. He has challenged misogyny within men’s football culture. He has championed female players and pundits. To publicly chastise him, as Aluko did, is not only unfair but strategically counterproductive. Allies matter. They matter because men listen to men. They matter because male fans are more receptive to male voices. They matter because the women’s game does not yet have the cultural power to stand alone without support from the wider football ecosystem.\n\nAlienating those allies does not empower women. It isolates them. And it hands misogynists exactly what they want: evidence, however flimsy, that women are ungrateful, divisive, or incapable of working collaboratively. Her comments have already been seized upon by individuals who were looking for a stick to beat women’s football with. They have been used to argue that women are entitled, that they want special treatment, that they cannot handle competition, that they resent male involvement. These narratives are not new. They are the same tired tropes that have been used to undermine women’s sport for decades. But when someone from within the game reinforces them, even unintentionally, they gain new life.\n\nThe emotional exhaustion of constantly having to defend women’s football from people who claim to support it is disheartening. It is draining to watch the same narratives resurface again and again. It is draining to see women blamed for structural problems they did not create. It is draining to see progress overshadowed by commentary that focuses on shortcomings rather than solutions. Women in sport are already doing the work. They are already pushing for better standards, better governance, better investment. They are already fighting for visibility and respect. They are already carrying the burden of proving themselves in a world that still doubts them.\n\nSo when someone with influence chooses to highlight problems in a way that lacks nuance or context, it feels like a betrayal, not because critique is unwelcome, but because it is delivered in a way that reinforces the very stereotypes women are trying to dismantle. There is a difference between constructive criticism and commentary that fuels existing biases. The former strengthens the game. The latter weakens it. Constructive criticism identifies problems while acknowledging context. It challenges systems rather than individuals. It recognises the structural barriers that shape outcomes. It pushes for improvement without undermining the legitimacy of the sport itself. Commentary that lacks this nuance does the opposite. It reinforces the idea that women’s sport is inherently flawed and women’s involvement in sport is tokenistic. It shifts responsibility away from institutions and onto individuals. It validates the scepticism of those who already doubt the women’s game. And it distracts from the real issues that need attention.\n\nAluko is not just another pundit. She is someone whose voice carries weight because of her history, her achievements, and her visibility. With that visibility comes responsibility. Not the responsibility to be silent, but the responsibility to be thoughtful. Women in sport do not need protection from criticism. They need protection from narratives that undermine their legitimacy. They need protection from commentary that reinforces the idea that they are the problem. They need protection from the same tired tropes that have been used to diminish them for decades. When Aluko speaks without acknowledging the structural context, she inadvertently strengthens those tropes. She shifts the focus away from the institutions that have failed women’s football and onto the women themselves. And that is where the harm lies.\n\nHer intentions may be rooted in wanting the game to improve. But improvement does not come from echoing the language of those who want the sport to fail. It does not come from demanding women be involved in men’s sports, but that the reverse cannot happen. It comes from challenging the systems that hold it back. It comes from amplifying the voices of those who are working tirelessly to build something better. It comes from recognising that women in sport are not the problem; they are the ones driving the solution.\n\nOne of the most insidious aspects of sexism in sport is the way it becomes internalised. Women are taught to be grateful for scraps. They are taught to accept criticism as the price of visibility. They are taught to believe that if the game is struggling, it must be their fault. When someone like Aluko reinforces these narratives, even unintentionally, it legitimises them. It makes it harder for women to push back. It makes it harder for them to demand better. And it makes it harder for the sport to grow in a healthy, sustainable way.\n\nWomen in football broadcasting such as Laura Woods, Alex Scott, Jules Breach, Emma Hayes, Eilidh Barbour, Reshmin Chowdhury, and Kate Abdo demonstrate exactly what excellence in punditry and presenting looks like. They are respected not because they are women, but because they bring authority, intelligence, and genuine football expertise to every broadcast. Their analysis is sharp, their delivery polished, and their understanding of the game deep and instinctive. Audiences value them because they elevate coverage through insight and professionalism, proving that women earn their place in football media through talent, credibility, and hard work, not entitlement. Their contributions enrich the sport and show what true representation looks like when it is built on merit.\n\nThe real barriers to women’s representation in punditry are not male allies. They are underinvestment in women’s broadcasting pathways, limited training and development opportunities, a lack of long-term career structures for female pundits, editorial decisions driven by audience metrics rather than equity, and institutional biases within media organisations. These are the issues that deserve attention. These are the issues that require advocacy. These are the issues that need to be challenged. But Aluko’s comments shift the focus away from these systemic problems and onto individuals, specifically male allies, who are not the cause of the inequality. Her comments appear to stem from a place of privilege, expectation and entitlement.\n\nThis misdirection is harmful because it allows institutions to avoid accountability. It allows broadcasters to continue underinvesting in women. It allows structural barriers to remain unchallenged. And it places the burden of progress on individuals rather than systems. Women’s football is at a pivotal moment. The growth is real, the talent is undeniable, and the appetite from fans is stronger than ever. But the foundations are still fragile. The structures are still uneven. And the respect is still conditional. In this context, commentary that reinforces old stereotypes does not help the game move forward. It pulls it back.\n\nThe women’s game is at a crucial point in its development, and every voice with a platform has the power to shape its trajectory. Eni Aluko’s frustrations about representation may be rooted in a desire for progress, but progress cannot be built on narratives that divide, alienate, or reinforce the very prejudices women are fighting against. Real change comes from challenging systems, not scapegoating allies; from expanding opportunities, not gatekeeping them; from strengthening solidarity, not fracturing it. Women’s football needs critique, ambition, and accountability, but it also needs unity, nuance, and an understanding that the fight for equality is bigger than any one individual. When commentary fuels misogynistic narratives rather than dismantling them, it becomes part of the problem. The women’s game deserves better than that, and the women within it deserve advocates who lift them up, not voices that inadvertently make their struggle harder.",

    "fullText": "You can’t win ‘em all, but you can choose how to respond to a defeat.\n\nThat’s the message Arizona men’s basketball coach Tommy Lloyd ended with Monday after the Wildcats dropped their first game of the season, a 82-78 loss to Kansas at Allen Fieldhouse.\n\nLloyd, known for being even-keeled, offered praise to Kansas for taking down the No. 1 team, crediting the Jayhawks for going on a second-half run to take control of the game. Lloyd also played down the officiating, despite KU taking 11 more free throws than Arizona.\n\n“I honestly don’t care how the game is officiated,” Lloyd said. “We should be fine. We’re a physical team and we’re built for it.”\n\nOur recap of the game be found here. Below is what Lloyd had to say postgame.\n\nLloyd on whether Arizona made any adjustments when it learned Darryn Peterson would be out: “Not really. Kansas has a lot of good players and a great coach. Playing them here, we knew it was going to be a dogfight, no matter which guys were wearing the Kansas Jayhawk jerseys. Obviously I’m sure they’re better with Peterson, but we felt like they were pretty good without him tonight as well.”\n\nOn Peterson not being listed on Kansas’ injury report: “I don’t even look at that, so no. I don’t even look at that to be honest with you. You guys can dig into that.”\n\nOn when he found out Peterson wouldn’t be playing: “10 minutes before the game. Guys, Kansas is a hell of a team. Let’s not make this about Darryn Peterson. He didn’t play because he was sick. They beat the number one team in the country at home tonight. They did a hell of a job, and their coach did a hell of a job that that should be the story.”\n\nOn Flory Bigunda’s defensive play and Arizona not finishing inside: “I wish he was guarding our guards. He really impacts the game at the rim. That game comes down to probably, if you have to start slicing and dicing and picking one or two things, and we didn’t finish at the rim well enough. And usually we’re really proficient at finishing at the rim. We’re getting fouled and it’s not very often we get out free throw’d, and it’s not very often we don’t make a higher percentage of our rim shots. So Kansas gets credit for that.”\n\nOn playing at Allen Fieldhouse: “It was awesome. Last year was really good. I don’t know how to compare the two. They’re both awesome. So awesome environment, and it makes it really difficult to play. And you guys need to know it does impact the game and and your fans deserve credit like that, just like our fans do at home when we’re playing in McKale.”\nTommy over here,\n\nOn what changed in the second half: “Nothing crazy, you know? I mean, I thought they kind of weathered a few runs by us, and then they kind of put their head down and really drove the ball got a lot of free throws. And then, Bidunga threw in a couple hooks, picked up a couple loose balls and was able to get to his jump hook and cashed them in. It it wasn’t like they weren’t making jump shots. I didn’t have to use anything. And then just in these games, they’re possession by possession, and they kind of made a run at the right time to get a little bit of a lead, and they did a good job managing, and did a great job making their free throws down the stretch.”\n\nOn Arizona struggling some in the paint: “Sometimes you come play in these hard environments in the Big 12 later in the season, and it’s fine. There’s no complaints. There’s going to be a lot that gets to go in the paint. The refs aren’t gonna guess, probably on both ends of the floor. So if you want to win these games, you got to deliver. You got to deliver when you get the ball inside, you got to be able to play through physical contact. You got to be able to be able to play through what you think are fouls, and you just got to keep it moving.”\n\nOn Arizona losing its first game: “Well, if a guy is 38-0 on his home court on Big Mondays, it’s probably pretty hard to win here, no matter what our record coming in is. So we knew it’s going to be a tough game, and we’re okay with it. Like guys, I’m not mad we lost. I can’t wait to get on that plane, get back home, and I feel like our season just started.”",

    "title": "Sunderland vs Liverpool: Dream Big At The Stadium Of Light",
    "description": "I’ll keep on dreaming until the dream is dead this season because, why the hell not?",
    "fullText": "Liverpool under the lights at the Stadium of Light is one of the games that we dreamt about when making the trek to Fleetwood, Accrington, and Burton just a few short years ago. The champions may be off the boil this season in terms of title credentials, but it’s still the sort of game it’s hard not to be excited for.\n\nOur underwhelming away form continued on Saturday, but in fairness, we far from disgraced ourselves at the Emirates, and Arsenal look set to win the title this year. We gave them a match for about an hour, and the second goal put the game beyond us. There’s a reason only one team has left that part of North London with all three points on just one occasion this season.\n\nAt the Stadium of Light, however, we are a different beast and are still unbeaten as February carries on. After a couple of draws, we’ve won back-to-back games at the SoL, scoring five goals in the process, which is a good start to our need to score more goals.\n\nWednesday night under the Wearside lights will be a tougher challenge than Crystal Palace or Burnley, but it feels as though Liverpool will far from relish coming to the SoL on their current run. A late defeat at home to Man City means they’ve won just one in seven before their trip across from Merseyside; no guesses as to who that one win was against.\n\nLiverpool have been far from their fluent best this season, and our 1-1 draw at Anfield could have been even better if certain chances had fallen our way. If feeling disappointed with a point away at the reigning Premier League champions isn’t a sign of how far we’ve come, then I don’t know what is.\n\nLiverpool at home is up there with welcoming Man Utd, Arsenal, and Chelsea in terms of feeling like we’re back in the Premier League. Our last home game against Liverpool was a rarity in that it was one of the few home games we didn’t lose during the 2016-17 season. Jermain Defoe scored two penalties in a 2-2 draw for the Lads, and the brief glimpse of hope came between a 4-1 loss at Burnley and then being turned over 3-1 at home to Stoke.\n\nIt’s easy to forget just how bad we were in that last Premier League season, but it’s important to remember that after finally shedding a lot of dead weight, both on and off the pitch, how much work has been needed to get to where we are now.\n\nLiverpool are still a colossus, one of the biggest and most widely supported teams in world football. However, we’ve shown in games against Arsenal, Chelsea, and Man City this season that we won’t roll over for any of the big boys, and we’ll give as good as we’ve got.\n\nThat 2-2 draw back in January 2017 was worth celebrating, as it was a point that gave some of us hope that we could put the fight in our relegation fight. A point this time around would keep us in the top half, whilst all three points would move us back firmly into the European places. I’ll keep on dreaming until the dream is dead this season because, why the hell not?",

    "title": "On This Day (10 Feb 1936): Sunderland Hero Jimmy Thorpe Is Laid To Rest",
    "description": "The streets of Jarrow were a mournful sight as crowds gathered to bid farewell to a shining star taken before his time",
    "fullText": "February 1936 was an emotional period for everybody connected with Sunderland AFC, and by the tenth of the month, it was time for everyone to pay their final respects to Jimmy Thorpe, the much-loved goalkeeper that had died the previous week following complications with injuries he’d suffered when playing for the Lads against Chelsea on the fifth.\n\nThorpe was a supremely gifted and extremely popular figure among teammates and supporters alike, and the tragic nature of his passing proved difficult to process. His funeral, which was attended by countless representatives of the game and members of the local community, showed just how much he was admired and missed, with people rallying to pay tribute to a young man that had been taken from his family much too soon.\n\nAlthough he’d been living in Cleadon with his wife May and son Ronnie, Thorpe was a Jarrow native.\n\nThe journey to Jarrow Cemetery began at May’s parents’ home on York Avenue in the Monkton area of the town and the cortege was observed by throngs of well-wishers that had lined the streets — many of whom had walked from Sunderland to be present. Although impeccably behaved, the numbers there meant police officers often had to hold back mourners to enable the procession to continue.\n\nOnce the invited attendees had reached the cemetery, the gates were locked so that the burial could be carried out in solitude.\n\nThe curate of Jarrow, Rev. Brittian, led proceedings before Thorpe’s oak casket was lowered into the ground next to a quiet spot by a tree; the pallbearers being his teammates Bobby Gurney, Alex Hastings, Bert Johnston, Harry Shaw, Billy Murray and fellow goalkeeper Matt Middleton.\n\nAlongside the current playing staff, many former players were attendance, as well as a raft of coaching and administration staff, with a slew of over one hundred names being listed in later editions of that days’s Sunderland Echo and Shipping Gazette.\n\nNumerous floral tributes were also sent, including one designed by manager/secretary Johnny Cochrane that depicted a football field inside a six-inch border (green to match Thorpe’s jersey) and a full-sized ball made from brown leaves that was placed in front of an empty goal-shaped wreath.\n\nSunderland Borough Police and Fire Brigade, the Sunderland players and staff, the Sunderland directors, the Roker Park gatemen, Ald FW Taylor, Chelsea, Hartlepools United, Newcastle United players officials and staff, Middlesbrough, Portsmouth, West Ham United, Everton, the Jarrow Junior Imperial League, and Jarrow AFC officials and players were amongst those also reported to have sent flowers — alongside various supporter groups.\n\nThe sheer volume of mourners, officials and tributes spoke to how popular a character Thorpe was, and how hard his death had hit the community.\n\nFor once, results and form seemed insignificant, as the focus in the region shifted away from the football and towards one of the people that made the game so special. Ninety years on from his funeral, we hope that Jimmy is still resting in peace.\n\n*The following is an abridged version of attendees as listed by the Echo, recreated now to underline Thorpe’s status, and the significance of his passing.\n\nFamily: J.H.A Thorpe (father), G.Lockhart (father-in-law), A.Thorpe (uncle), G.Maughan (uncle), E and A.

    "description": "Since October 2024, Frank Ilett has refused to cut his hair until Manchester United win five games in row – now, the end of this viral challenge and absurd look is finally in sight",
    "fullText": "“Do it for Frank” is unlikely to form part of Michael Carrick’s team talk as Manchester United head to West Ham this evening. But perhaps it should. It is clear that when fan Frank Ilett vowed not to cut his hair until his team had won five games in a row, he did not expect to be approaching 500 days without stepping into a barber’s, or for his look to have grown quite so ridiculous, or to have accumulated more social media followers than some Manchester United first-team players. After four consecutive wins, though, he is extremely close to his self-inflicted ordeal finally being over.\n\nIlett’s challenge began on 5 October 2024 and amid the club’s worst-ever start to a Premier League season. It was a bit of a joke, the 29-year-old said, with the hope of “spreading some humour and positivity” and helping the club’s supporters get through the “dark days” – United had saved a wretched season the year before by winning the FA Cup, but it was clear all was not well. By the end of the month, manager Erik ten Hag had been sacked and the promise of the smiling Ruben Amorim arrived. At the time, the idea of a rejuvenated United going on a run was hardly inconceivable, but then the nosedive started. Under Amorim, United stumbled through the rest of a doomed campaign, finishing 15th in the Premier League and losing the Europa League final.\n\nI never expected to still be growing my hair, a year on 😳\n\nI hope I've made you smile on some of these dark days and hope that soon, we'll all be smiling together at the results! 🤞\n\nI don't think we're as far away from winning ways as it seems.. 🙏#manunited #hairchallenge pic.twitter.com/5hRnBnNAlX\n\n— TheUnitedStrand (@TheUnitedStrand) October 6, 2025\n\nAs the losses mounted and United’s slide worsened, Ilett’s hair ballooned and the size of his audience did too. His various ‘The United Strand’ accounts, across Instagram, TikTok, X and YouTube, gained hundreds of thousands of followers, with his daily updates accumulating millions of views. At the centre of each video was, of course, the hair, which with each passing month not only grew longer but became more ridiculous, expanding outwards in every direction, bobbing on top of his head and hovering around the back of his neck like a thick shrub of floating gas. United’s dismal end of the season consigned Ilett to a whole summer beneath this absurd, dense, bushy cloud. That the Oxford-born Ilett now lives in sunny Spain added to the weight he was under.\n\nThroughout it all, Ilett has remained positively upbeat and endlessly optimistic that United’s fortunes could turn. In doing so, he has also raised money for the mental health charity Mind and, when he surpassed his previous fundraising target, the Little Princess Trust; when Ilett is eventually sheared, his locks will be donated and turned into wigs for young cancer patients dealing with hair loss. Even as United have been so woeful, this has, at least, been an entertaining sideshow. While it has been as notorious in this particular spell of the club’s steady decline as Old Trafford’s leaky roof, Amorim’s 3-4-2-1, big Sir Jim’s cuts and Roy Keane’s rants – it is one that will, in the end, bring some good into the world.\n\nAnd yet, for some, Ilett’s hair is an overgrown reminder of the depths United have fallen to, and a case study into the often divisive impact of the viral online fan/content creator. It was the toxic atmosphere that consumed the final years of Arsene Wenger’s legendary reign at Arsenal, for example, that proved fertile ground for the growth of Arsenal Fan TV. Back then, a fuming post-match monologue outside the Emirates following the club’s latest heavy defeat to Bayern Munich would be guaranteed to slap, racking up millions of views across digital platforms. As content, AFTV was an unbelievable success. But to the loyal, match-going supporter, AFTV were accused of gleefully feeding on the embarrassment and eating up the hits. Arsenal are far from the only Premier League club to have experienced this split between factions.\n\nIlett has not yet required a police escort when leaving away grounds, or had Old Trafford collectively chant “get out of our club” for inadvertently highlighting their shortcomings. But that is not to say his challenge has not been without incident. In September, a grim clip of Ilett being assaulted in the concourse while attending United's home match against Chelsea was widely shared online - with his hair grabbed and forcefully yanked downwards by another supporter, who was later banned from Old Trafford. Ilett told the Manchester Evening News that he had been called an “attention-seeking c**t” but reported that 99 per cent of all other reactions were positive. Since then, his following on Instagram has tripled from almost 400,000 to over 1.2m and thankfully, perhaps for everyone, the end is in sight.\n\nAs head coach, Amorim said he hoped United would find the form for Ilett to get his hair cut as soon as possible. Yet it was the Portuguese’s departure in early January that proved to be the turning point: with Michael Carrick at the wheel, United have beaten Manchester City, Arsenal, Fulham and Tottenham in consecutive games and head to West Ham tonight bidding for five wins in a row. It will have been 493 days since Ilett began his challenge and the excitement is palpable: Carrick’s teenage children, naturally, are followers and have made sure their dad is aware. He joked he would not put undue pressure on his players by letting them know what is on the line at the London Stadium, although they too have been peppered with questions about Ilett whenever they win a couple of games in a row.\n\n“I can understand what’s going on with it and it does make me smile, but it won’t have an impact,” Carrick maintained. A win for United would continue their resurgence and march towards a return to the Champions League; for Ilett, it will bring the end of a light-hearted stunt that has, in more ways than one, grown out of control. He will have his five minutes of fame. He will give the same interview on his round of breakfast TV couches. Someone will have paid an inordinate amount for the money shot of the barber’s clippers running through the tangled mess, and Ilett will feel a whole lot lighter.\n\nWhat does this all say about the sense of entitlement that appears to be seeping into modern-day fandom? Perhaps it will inspire copycats: a Liverpool fan from Southend on hunger strike until they sign a defender, a Tottenham supporter in Cork handcuffing themselves to a park bench until Thomas Frank is sacked. But ultimately, if all goes to plan, the winners will be United, and the players who would no longer have to be reminded of their part in this woeful chapter.",

    "fullText": "The American short-track speed skating team will look to get back on the podium at the 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics after being shutout at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games.\n\nEight short-track speeders will represent Team USA in Milano Cortina, including five returning Olympians (Kristen Santos-Griswold, Corinne Stoddard, Julie Letai, Eunice Lee and Andrew Heo) and three first-timers (Kamryn Lute, Brandon Kim and Clayton DeClemente). The U.S. has won 20 Olympic medals in short-track speed skating, most recently John-Henry Krueger's silver in the 1000m at the 2018 PyeongChang Games.\n\nShort-track speed skating was staged as a demonstration sport at the 1988 Calgary Winter Games and officially made its Olympic debut at the 1992 Albertville Winter Games. The 2000m mixed team relay was added to the program at the 2022 Beijing Games.\n\nUnlike speed skating, where athletes race against the clock, short-track speed skating pits racers against each other, highlighting the importance of strategy in this event. Short-track speed skating, takes place on a shorter track (111.12 meters long) like the name suggests, compared to a speed skating track (400 meters long).\n\nThere will be nine short-track speed skating medal events in Milano Cortina:\n\n2000m mixed team relay: Each team consists of two women and two men.\n\nKristen Santos-Griswol: Santos-Griswold was in medal contention in the 1000m race at the 2022 Beijing Olympics when she was bumped by an opponent and fell. She finished just off the podium in fourth place and contemplated retirement. Santos-Griswol, 31, came back strong and won five medals at the 2024 World Championships, including a 1000m gold, to become the first U.S. skater to win medals at three individual distances (500m, 1,000m, 1,500m) at one world competition. She won her first Crystal Globe for the 2024-25 season, which is awarded to the best overall skater.\n\nCorinne Stoddard: The 24-year-old is looking to improve upon her seventh-place finish in the 1000m race at the 2022 Beijing Winter Games. Stoddard won three medals at the 2024 World Championships and finished the 2025-26 World Tour second overall after winning eight individual medals (3 silver, 5 bronze).\n\nSantos-Griswol and Stoddard will look to dethrone Italian Arianna Fontana, who's set to compete in her sixth Olympics. Fontana has 11 Olympic medals to her name, including back-to-back golds in the 500m. Don't count out South Korea, which leads all countries with 53 total short-track speed skating Olympic medals and 26 gold.\n\nThe 2026 Milano Cortina Winter Olympics are here! \n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Short-track speed skating at 2026 Milano Cortina: US stars to watch",

    "fullText": "The winter transfer window has been and gone, with a raft of new arrivals landing in the Kingdom ready to begin their Roshn Saudi League journey.\n\nWhat’s noticeable once more is our clubs' collective preference to look for players of a younger age profile, as the dynamic around signing players changes with an eye on the future.\n\nWith that in mind, here are some of the RSL's fresh faces to keep an eye on for the remainder of the season.\n\nAl Hilal seem to have struck gold with the signing of the highly rated 18-year-old forward from Rennes.\n\nAmid the drama of the final days of the transfer window, Meite’s signing almost slipped under the radar, but it hasn’t gone unnoticed around the world given the striker was recently linked with a move to English giants Manchester United.\n\nConsidered a star of the future for the French national team, he’ll get invaluable tutelage working alongside compatriot, and fellow new addition, Karim Benzema.\n\nFrom one young French sensation to another, the RSL champions will be buoyed by the capture of the 19-year-old forward who, despite his tender age, has already racked up more than 100 appearances across stints with Amiens, Antwerp and AS Monaco. As such, a switch to Lille this window was mooted.\n\nMaking his debut in the Coupe de France aged only 16 years, Ilenikhena scored five goals in 38 appearances for AS Monaco across the past season and a half and, in 2023, was named on The Guardian’s “Next Generation” list of best young talents in world football.\n\nAl Kholood were busy in the winter transfer window as they sought to strengthen the side to further their push for survival. And the 25-year-old Spaniard, who most recently played in La Liga 2 with SD Huesca, looks one of the more interesting recruits.\n\nGiven Al Kholood’s connection to Spanish football through pioneering owner Ben Harburg, who also boasts in his portfolio La Liga 2 side Cadiz, there would be a keen understanding of the Spanish market, especially its second division.\n\nWith that in mind, Al Kholood would’ve no doubt seen Kortajarena up close this season. Therefore, they’ll be fully aware of what the attacking midfielder can bring to the table.\n\nWith six of their foreign contingent coming from South America, Al Taawoun have thought outside that particular box with the acquisition of the 22-year-old Bulgarian international striker.\n\nCapped more than 20 times for his country, Petkov was the joint-top scorer for Levski Sofia last season as they finished second in his homeland’s lead division, and his seven goals already this season helped the club to top spot in the table.\n\nWith Al Taawoun in a bit of a rut at the moment, Petkov could be just what they need to rediscover their mojo as Pericles Chamusca's aspiring side look to secure a top-five finish.\n\nIt wasn’t only foreign stars arriving in the RSL; one of the country’s most promising youngsters also returned after time spent in Europe with both Dunkerque in France and Lausanne-Sport in Switzerland.\n\nAl Saad is not a new addition at NEOM SC having joined in 2024 when they were in the second tier but, having been on loan in recent times, his comeback will feel like a new signing for Christophe Galtier’s men.\n\nHugely ambitious, the promoted club could do with a spark to resuscitate their debut-campaign's objectives. For that, Al Saad’s comeback could prove very timely, indeed.\n\nAl Riyadh were another club busy in the market, with a handful of fresh additions to their squad. And, given their predicament this season, it’s easy to understand why.\n\nWhat the capital club require, as they try to navigate a way to safety, are experienced heads and, in Algerian international Victor Lekhal, they might have found just that.\n\nAged 31, the French-born midfielder has built more than 200 games’ worth of pro knowhow featuring for Le Habre in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2. Also, he understands the region having most recently played in Qatar with Umm Salal and Kuwait with Qadsia SC.\n\nAl Riyadh signed experienced midfielder Victor Lekhal to bolster their fight for survival\n\nThe 21-year-old has been on the fringes of the Jordanian national team for a while now, but finally got his chance to impress when he made his debut against Mali in November.\n\nAzaizeh backed that up with a star showing at the recent AFC Under-23 Asian Cup, finishing joint-top scorer with four goals, which included a brace against Saudi Arabia that no doubt put him on the radar of clubs in the RSL.\n\nWith the 2026 FIFA World Cup on the horizon, a good showing for Al Shabab could put Azaizeh on the plane to North America.\n\nOnly a year ago, the Cameroon international was playing in La Liga for Getafe against the likes of Barcelona and Real Madrid, while he also has developed big-game experience in Ligue 1 with Saint-Etienne and in representing his country at the 2021 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nThat type of elite-level education, principally promoting a calm head when things don’t go your way, could be exactly what Al Okhdood require in the remaining matches as the second-from-bottom club try to dig their way out of the relegation zone.",

    "fullText": "LAWRENCE, Kan. (AP) — The Kansas climb picked up more steam Monday night as the No. 9 Jayhawks knocked off top-ranked Arizona 82-78.\n\nLess than a month after falling out of The Associated Press Top 25, Kansas (19-5, 9-2 Big 12) has won eight in a row and clawed its way back into Big 12 title contention, trailing previously unbeaten Arizona (23-1, 10-1) by one game. Houston is currently in second, a half-game ahead of Kansas. The third-ranked Cougars face Utah on Tuesday night.\n\n“We couldn’t lose this game,” senior guard Melvin Council Jr. said after knocking off Arizona. “We were just ready and prepared and we knew it was going to be a long game with a bunch of runs.”\n\nKansas trailed by as many as 11 points in the game and did not hold a lead until the clock read 9:32 in the second half. Four Jayhawks finished in double figures, led by Flory Bidunga and Council Jr, who scored 23 points apiece. Bidunga also grabbed 10 rebounds.\n\nThe Jayhawks played without freshman standout Darryn Peterson, who was experiencing flu-like symptoms and missed the game. Self revealed after the game that Peterson had missed practice on Sunday and didn’t know until about a half hour before the game that he would be unavailable. Despite missing 11 games, Peterson leads the Jayhawks in scoring, averaging 20.5 points.\n\n“A lot of teams, this time of year, when you get to early February, they know where their ceiling is, and the great teams are operating pretty close to their ceiling, Kansas coach Bill Self said. “I don’t know where our ceiling is, and I know that we’re not close to it yet, though.”\n\nThe victory ended a 23-game winning streak for Arizona. It was the second-longest streak in Division I men’s basketball behind Miami (Ohio), which has won 24 straight.\n\nWith the win, Kansas improved to 2-2 against top-10 opponents this season. It was also the Jayhawks’ first win against the AP’s top-ranked team at Allen Fieldhouse.\n\n“Kansas is a hell of a team,” Arizona coach Tommy Lloyd said after the game. “They beat the No. 1 team in the country at home tonight. They did a hell of a job and their coach did a hell of a job.”\n\nFour Jayhawks finished the game in double figures, with Bryson Tiller scoring 18 and Jamari McDowell adding 10.\n\nBrayden Burries led all scorers with 25 points for Arizona.

    "title": "WWE Raw - 2/9/2026: 3 Things We Loved And 3 We Hated",
    "description": "The best and the worst of the February 9 edition of \"WWE Raw\"",
    "fullText": "The card for Elimination Chamber is starting to come into sharper focus after another edition of \"WWE Raw.\" The show was full of table-setting for the company's upcoming trip to Chicago, with two title matches made, and two more Elimination Chamber competitors determined. But enough about what happened, that's been handled by the results page.\n\nInstead, it's time to talk about the euphoric highs and pitiful lows of Monday's show. There was plenty to love, like the opening bickering between AJ Lee and Becky Lynch, or the fact that Adam Pearce has never had a good night in his entire history as GM. There was also plenty to hate, like the weird, unfocused segments that existed to simply stretch out the road to WrestleMania.\n\nEnough of my bloviating, let's break down the good and the bad from Monday's edition of the WWE flagship.\n\nAdam Pearce has not had a single good Monday since he became general manager of \"Raw.\" It has become something of an entertaining lodestar for my weekly catch up.\n\nPearce is something of a pain sponge, meant to take as much verbal, physical, psychological, and emotional abuse as the \"Raw\" locker room can throw at him, and he does a damn good job doing it. Pearce looked ridiculous in several segments tonight, including the one where he seemed to suggest that Finn Balor winning the World Heavyweight Championship would be beneath the WrestleMania main event, and each time, his tortured expression had me cackling. He would've been a tremendous silent film star.\n\nNick Aldis is a little too cool a customer, and \"NXT\" is so chaotic that neither Ava nor interim GM Robert Stone ever quite come across as the middle-management clown that Pearce does every week. It's a thankless job to be the bumbling GM of a goofy wrestling show, but I'm here to correct that, and give the former NWA Worlds Heavyweight Champion his due and proper.\n\nI am all for having WWE stars take part in more than one storyline at a time, but I also feel like there's a time and a place for that to happen. Jey Uso taking part in the Men's Elimination Chamber Triple Threat Qualifier matches is not one of those times where I feel like it's a good idea to have someone to have their hand in more than one pot at a time.\n\nNow, I feel like it's important to quickly acknowledge that Jimmy Uso has reportedly been dealing with some personal matters, and that could be a major factor regarding the pivot for Jey back into singles competition for the time being. With that said, considering that this edition of \"Raw\" was the first time that The Usos have ever defended the World Tag Team Championship since winning them all the way back on December 29 against Alpha Academy, it should go without saying that all storylines that Jimmy and Jey are involved in as of right now somehow connect to the \"Raw\" tag team division and the World Tag Team Championship. It makes absolutely no sense to have Jey revert back to a singles competitor in order for him to compete in a Men's Elimination Chamber Triple Threat Qualifier and presumably the Men's Elimination Chamber Match itself (since it would be so odd to put him in a qualifier otherwise). The \"Raw\" men's division has absolutely no shortage of other talent who WWE could slot into Jey's place instead, including names like Je'Von Evans or Dominik Mysterio, who could benefit from being involved in the more serious storyline that Elimination Chamber would provide for them. Moreover, Jimmy encouraging Jey to take part in the Triple Threat Qualifier feels strange to me, as one would think that he would be more focused on the World Tag Team Championship and defending it. The entire thing feels like such a random decision, and a move that makes absolutely no sense to me at all.\n\nLast Monday, Liv Morgan seemed to choose Stephanie Vaquer as her WrestleMania opponent when she attacked Vaquer following her match and held Vaquer's title in the air. Then she showed up on SmackDown, and Jade Cargill told her she'd beat her a** at \"The Show of Shows\" if she chose her.\n\nTonight, after receiving roses and chocolate from \"Dirty Dom\" in the ring, Morgan said that both Vaquer and Cargill are afraid to face her because whoever she chooses will lose their title to her. Right on cue, Vaquer came to the ring and told Morgan she spoke too much. Then she set her sights on Mysterio, and they conversed in Spanish. When Morgan asked him to translate, he refused. The exchange between Vaquer and Mysterio was different than what we typically see. At such a divisive time in this country and on the heels of a Super Bowl halftime show that was almost completely in Spanish, it was cool to have this exchange. Mysterio added to it by refusing to translate. Vaquer claimed that Mysterio called Morgan a \"b****\". Morgan called her a liar and a p*** before Mysterio ended up getting slapped by Vaquer.\n\nMorgan said she isn't rushing to take her time. Whomever she chooses, there will be time to build up a story, assuming Morgan doesn't take too long. WWE is currently focused on hyping CM Punk vs. Roman Reigns as potentially one of the \"greatest WrestleMania main events of all time\", so giving Morgan time to make a choice is smart. It also makes both the Women's Championship and Women's World Championship look equally important. When Morgan finally decides, it will hopefully make the decision and the match more impactful.\n\nI've never been a fan of El Grande Americano, ever since the bit came about while Chad Gable was feuding with luchadors.\n\nI didn't like the \"character\" then, I didn't like it when another EGA popped up while Gable was doing the shtick, I didn't like it when Ludwig Kaiser was then boxed into the EGA role while Gable was out injured, and I certainly didn't like it when WWE decided to throw more Americanos into the mix in the form of Tyler Bate and Pete Dunne.\n\nObviously, WWE cannot book exclusively to my liking. But I do get to complain about it here, so read on if you disagree, because chances are I am not going to convince you otherwise. Still here? Okay, wel,l let me at least rationalize it.\n\nThis week's \"WWE Raw\" saw Je'Von Evans teaming up with TBC to take on Los Americanos, with EGA Kaiser standing at ringside. TBC wound up being the returning OG EGA – Gable, who, of course, entered the Royal Rumble, which was too full for Finn Balor, so he could eliminate EGA Kaiser.\n\nBut before we could get to the graps, Los Americanos cut a promo to the crowd, and I will concede that at the very least Kaiser knows how to speak Spanish, while the other two just spoke in a stereotypical accent, ensuring to roll every 'R' and turn every 'Y' into a 'J.'\n\nIt feels somewhat obvious to say that there is absolutely no need for Kaiser, a German, Bate and Dunne, Britons, and Gable, from the US, to impersonate luchadors when there are legitimate luchadors scattered across the promotion. Once more, the issue is not that they are wearing a mask. The issue is not that they are performing as characters. The issue is that there is a conceited effort to parody lucha libre and Latin people in the most tasteless, dregs-of-the-barrel way.\n\nWhen we did get to the match, Evans took a backseat to the OG EGA as he got the winning pin – albeit after a really impressive cutter – and then had a little tussle with EGA Kaiser in obvious promotion for an eventual Mask vs. Mask match.\n\nThe match wasn't bad because it was Evans, Kaiser, Gable, Bate, and Dunne wrestling. But the story, if one could be so bold as to call it that, sucked all the way to the core.\n\nOne may say not to see it as a political thing, but I would say that while the head of creative stands next to a President open in his contempt for the people being parodied on WWE programming, it's impossible not to see it that way.\n\nI know many fans expected the return of AJ Lee during the women's Royal Rumble to kick off her reported WrestleMania 42 program with Becky Lynch, and thankfully, after Lee didn't seem to make the trip to Saudi Arabia, we got that tonight. Despite not liking Lynch's current character at all (I cannot stress enough how much I absolutely hate this gimmick, and I'll leave it at that), I liked how this played out tonight, from the very beginning.\n\nLee's return tonight on \"Raw\" was a surprise, as I didn't see it reported anywhere. She popped up beside her husband, CM Punk, during his entrance to the arena, and very shortly after, incensed Lynch popped into frame, which I thought was cute. Then, Lynch opened up the show, interrupting Corey Graves' opening spiel, because she was so angry about Lee being back.\n\nAnd, thankfully, in my case, with hating having to hear this character speak, Lee interrupted her very quickly. Lee went out about how she didn't think she ruined Lynch's life, then of course spouted off everything that's been happening since she made her tap out at Wrestlepalooza, from beating her in WarGames to costing her the Women's Intercontinental Championship once before. It all made Lynch crash out, and the back-and-forth between the women was pretty good before they finally came to the agreement that they'd face off one-on-one for the title at Elimination Chamber.\n\nI liked Lee standing her ground that she wouldn't be having her first singles match in over ten years, which was an important fact to bring up to remind fans, for anything less than the title. I also expected this to happen at WrestleMania, and while I still expect this program to go until \"The Showcase of the Immortals,\" I think Lynch's first defense against Lee happening in Chicago is the way to go. Lee might even win there, making Lynch's crash out all the more insane, and they take it through to 'Mania with the gold on Lee. Lynch's further descent into madness could even spark some more fun comments and promos about mental health from Lee, which I, and the crowd, enjoyed last time.\n\nNo matter how you book things moving forward, I was just glad things kicked off tonight between them. Lee may be the only thing that makes Lynch's act tolerable, to me at least, and it was good to see her back.\n\nI was really hoping tonight that WWE would establish Natalya's \"Nattie\" character hot right out of the gate, which, of course, was wishful thinking. What we got was pretty lame, if not a completely confusing mess. Sure, we saw the Nattie character for the first time, complete with new, \"Killing in the Name\" Rage Against The Machine-inspired music, in the women's Royal Rumble, but tonight was kind of a big deal, as it was her first singles match portraying the new, more fierce character.\n\nNattie faced off against Maxxine Dupri, and while there was at least some kind of story there for the match to make sense, Dupri isn't exactly a formidable opponent. It would have done Nattie well to have just squashed her. WWE must have more planned for Dupri following her forgettable reign with the Women's Intercontinental Championship, because I can't think of another reason as to why this match would have ended this way, other than to bring in the other women involved in the post-match angle.\n\nRather than take out Dupri in the middle of the ring, Nattie seemed to snap after dodging the Ankle Lock and some of Dupri's offense, and cleared the commentary desk. She laid out Dupri on the table and started beating her down, not caring at all about the referee's 10 count. I did at least like the fact that they continued the story with AJ Lee and Dupri, as it was Lee who helped Dupri win the Women's Intercontinental Championship from Becky Lynch in the first place. She ran down to help, which drove Nattie off, which was confusing, as she's supposed to be a big, strong bada**, and then Lynch ran down to take out Lee, which further removed Nattie from the center of this all. Which, again, made little sense, as she also has a possible story right there with Lynch, whom she eliminated from the Rumble.\n\nThe match felt more like a vehicle for Lee and Lynch by the end of it. Thankfully, Nattie was at least announced for an Elimination Chamber qualifying match next week, and she'll go up against Bayley and Asuka. I actually, somehow, have some faith in her, mostly because I think Bayley and Asuka might take one another out if Dupri stays out of the mix, but I still really wish Nattie would have had a stronger showing tonight. With all of WWE's questionable booking decisions and reported changes to many things on \"The Road to WrestleMania,\" this may be minor, but it still stuck out to me, and I hate this for Natalya.\n\nDon't miss any of the major wrestling headlines.

    "fullText": "In the eyes of Lakers coach JJ Redick, every team his group faces is a test. Still, many wondered if the Lakers’ litmus test would come from facing the defending champion Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night.\n\nEven with All-Star and league most valuable player Shai Gilgeous-Alexander out with a strained abdominal, the Thunder are still a problem for most of the league. And the Lakers had to play OKC with their own MVP candidate, Luka Doncic, sitting out for the second straight game with a left hamstring strain.\n\nIn the end, the Thunder had seven players score in double figures and pulled out a 119-110 win over the Lakers at Crypto.com Arena.\n\nThe Lakers (32-19) had six players score in double figures, but it wasn’t enough.\n\nLeBron James had 22 points, 10 assists and six rebounds, Marcus Smart had 19 points, Austin Reaves 16 off the bench, Jake LaRavia 14 and Rui Hachimura and Jaxon Hayes both had 12 points.\n\nReaves gave the Lakers a 99-98 lead on a drive to the basket in the fourth quarter.\n\nBut the Thunder just kept coming back, taking a 109-101 lead by outscoring the Lakers 11-2.\n\nThe Lakers, too, kept fighting back, getting to within 113-110 on a Hachimura basket.\n\nBut Jalen Williams, who had 23 points in his return to the lineup, kept scoring for the Thunder, making a field goal, two free throws with 35.9 seconds left and two more with 20.9 seconds left that sealed the game.\n\nReaves provided the fans with a big-time highlight, driving down the lane and throwing down a two-handed dunk on Jaylin Williams and Aaron Wiggins to end the first quarter.\n\nThe Lakers had 20 turnovers the last time they played at Oklahoma City in a game L.A. got down by as much as 37 points before losing by 29.\n\nSo, one point of emphasis for the Lakers was taking care of the basketball and then playing a high level of basketball despite the opponent.\n\n“For our group, it felt like it's good to see where we're at every single night,” Redick said.\n\nHis team spent the entire first half climbing out of a hole.\n\nThe Lakers were down by just one at the end of the first quarter, but quickly got down 52-38 early in the second quarter.\n\nBut behind a James dunk over Chet Holmgren, the Lakers got to within two points in the second, drawing cheers from the fans.\n\nBut the Lakers couldn’t keep up that momentum, going down 67-58 at the half.\n\nThen in the third quarter, the Lakers got rolling and opened an eight-point lead behind a strong defense and good offense.\n\nBut again, the Thunder didn’t stop playing hard, coming back to open a 93-91 lead at the end of the third quarter on an Alex Caruso three-pointer.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nThe Los Angeles Lakers were playing well against the Oklahoma City Thunder on Monday night, but they could not beat the defending champions. OKC won 119-110, an impressive result for the Lakers given Luka Doncic's absence.\n\nLeBron James led the way for the Lakers with a decent line of 22 points, six rebounds, and 10 assists. His highest-scoring teammate was Marcus Smart, who had 19, while Austin Reaves had 16.\n\nFor the first three quarters, James was playing quite well. The offense was running through him, as he was scoring and making some big-time plays.\n\nUnfortunately, that faded away in the fourth quarter, as the Lakers were quite passive. Considering James was the driving force for the first three quarters, not giving him touches was the biggest mistake the Lakers made during the game.\n\nMORE: LeBron James gets honest on the best quality he wants to see from other basketball players\n\nAfter the game, Redick was pleased with the team's effort, but their execution was lacking. Considering their best player was out injured, they had to rely on James and Reaves, who just returned to the active lineup recently.\n\nThat should have meant that James would get the most touches to maximize his good performance. Unfortunately, Redick and the Lakers did not get James his deserved touches much in crunch time.\n\n\"I don’t think we did a good job on getting LeBron ball. Some of that was that we called the plays, but we didn’t execute. Some of that was just not having the recognition,\" Redick said in his post-game interview.\n\n\"Him playing against smaller players was how we got back in the game. And we didn’t do a good job of getting him the ball.\"\n\nIn the long run, the Lakers should know which player they can rely on to carry them. Doncic has been the obvious choice for the most part, but James is still a huge star despite his age. Relying on him should be normal for the Lakers.\n\nLakers now know the asking price for Giannis Antetokounmpo trade\n\nDid Bad Bunny diss Lakers' LeBron James during Super Bowl halftime show?\n\nRob Pelinka's reasoning for Lakers' disappointing trade season should enrage fans\n\nLeBron James haters are sharing a wild AI video of him knocking out Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry and more NBA legends\n\nLakers urged to pair Luka Doncic with 6-foot-3 former Nets star guard via buyout",

    "description": "Why Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo is proving Ruben Amorim was wrong to keep ignoring him.",
    "fullText": "It was after Manchester United's first game against West Ham this season that Ruben Amorim let his guard down on Kobbie Mainoo.\n\nUnited drew 1-1 with the relegation-threatened Hammers at Old Trafford in December, with Mainoo left on the bench throughout - and Amorim deciding Lisandro Martinez for Luke Shaw was a better final substitution as he looked for a winner.\n\n\"You always ask me the same thing,\" said United's then manager, when questioned why he had left the 20-year-old on the bench.\n\n\"I understand what you are saying. You love Kobbie. He starts for England, but that doesn't mean I need to put Kobbie on when I feel I shouldn't.\"\n\nThe \"you love Kobbie\" comment felt personal. The rationale, in Amorim's mind, for why he was repeatedly being asked by the media why he hardly used Mainoo.\n\nThat assessment missed the point.\n\nIt was not that the media loved Mainoo. It was that they had previously seen the positive benefits he can bring to a team.\n\nJudging by the 25,000 likes on a social media post on X during the 2-0 win over Tottenham on Saturday, observing that with each passing game Amorim's stance on Mainoo looks ridiculous, huge numbers of fans had seen it too.\n\nFans also failed to understand why the academy-raised midfielder did not start a single Premier League match this season prior to Amorim's departure.\n\nAmorim's initial replacement, Darren Fletcher, brought Mainoo on for the final 16 minutes of last month's draw at Burnley, having ditched the three-man central defence to allow for an extra player in the middle of the pitch.\n\nThe midfielder started the following game against Brighton in the FA Cup and has kept his place for all four matches of Michael Carrick's short reign.\n\nAgainst Tottenham, Mainoo created Bryan Mbeumo's opener with a deft pass to the edge of the penalty area with the inside of his right foot after dashing across the goal to meet Bruno Fernandes' short corner.\n\n\"Yes, there's no doubt,\" said Carrick afterwards, upon being asked whether Mainoo was back to the level of his breakthrough season in 2023-24, when he scored in the FA Cup final and started for England in the Euros final defeat by Spain.\n\nOn the face of it, seven goals and five assists in 90 first-team appearances does not look much.\n\nBut that is not the point. Mainoo has an excellent feel for the flow of games and is an all-round midfielder.\n\nThat applied to Carrick himself two decades ago. It was the reason Sir Alex Ferguson brought him north from Tottenham.\n\nIn a chat with his brother Graeme for the Football Association before he left United in 2018, Carrick himself explained the subtleties of a \"great pass\".\n\n\"The execution is probably the easiest bit a lot of the time,\" he said.\n\n\"It is about preparing for it, getting your body position right, understanding the context of the game, knowing the risk and reward.\n\n\"Even if it is a three-yard pass, you are giving the ball to someone for them to do something instantly. If they have to take a touch and another touch to get hold of the ball, it is not a great pass.\n\n\"You should be dictating what the next pass should be, and your own passing angle should be right.\n\n\"It is a great pass if the next part is how you see it in your head.\"\n\n'I feel at home here' - Carrick hints he wants Man Utd stay\n\nWhy Man Utd are taking their time over manager decision\n\nMainoo's resurgence has created separate debates.\n\nThe first, clearly, relates to Amorim, not just on one individual player but an apparent lack of trust in United's academy, which staff members picked up on and were furious about.\n\nIt is amazing to think six of Mainoo's 10 senior caps came during Euro 2024. He played the first Nations League game immediately afterwards, but - after pulling out of the October squad that followed - has not featured since.\n\nGiving himself a chance to break into Thomas Tuchel's World Cup squad was the reason why he was so keen to join Napoli on loan before the summer transfer window closed.\n\nNow he has five games at the most - starting with Tuesday's return meeting at West Ham - to force his way into Tuchel's plans for the March friendlies with Uruguay and Japan, two years after gatecrashing Gareth Southgate's squad at just the right time.\n\nWith Elliot Anderson, Adam Wharton and Alex Scott, who are all on United's radar as they look to reinforce their midfield in the summer, named in November's squad, Mainoo has his work cut out.\n\nCarrick knows the youngster has time on his side.\n\n\"We have to be careful about putting so much on his shoulders and expecting so much of him,\" he said.\n\n\"He's still learning the game. He's had a big high, and then, obviously, didn't play for a little bit.\n\n\"It's easy to think he's a lot older and more experienced than he is. He's just got to be patient.\"\n\nMan Utd keen to resume Mainoo contract talks\n\nLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "The Charlotte Hornets and the Detroit Pistons put on a show Monday night, and it had little to do with basketball. In the third quarter, players from both sides got into an all-out brawl that baffled spectators, and other NBA players who later saw the footage had strong reactions as well.\n\nThe altercation began when Moussa Diabate fouled Jalen Duren. Duren responded by pushing Diabaté in the face, which quickly escalated the situation. Moments later, Isaiah Stewart came running from the Pistons bench and got into it with Miles Bridges, who had also stepped into the fray. The chaos ultimately led to all four players being ejected.\n\nJaylen Brown was at home, streaming. And with the Hornets vs. Pistons brawl being the talk of the town, he decided to react to it.\n\nThe Celtics star understood why Diabate lost his cool. In the heat of the moment, he said that when someone “mushes” or shoves another player’s face, it can make your blood boil. Brown even hinted that he might have reacted the same way if he were in Diabate’s position.\n\n“If a dude takes his hand and mush your face like that… I ain’t gon lie, somebody gotta die,” Brown declared, treating the mushing of one’s face as the ultimate disrespect.\n\nThe NBA, however, will not agree with Diabate or any of the other three involved. The players will likely be suspended, with Stewart, who ran the length of the court to join a fight he was not initially involved in, expected to face the harshest penalty.\n\nStewart, meanwhile, was unapologetic. “You don’t expect me to sit on the bench. The f *k I got drafted to Detroit for,”* he was heard saying in the tunnel after getting ejected. Duren, on the other hand, seemed to realize that the situation got out of hand.\n\n“At the end of the day, we would love to keep it basketball, but things happen. Everybody was just playing hard,” he said, but admittedthat the Pistons have been targeted by rivals throughout the entire season. “This isn’t the first time that people have tried to be like extra aggressive with us and talk to us, whatever the case may be.”\n\nThe post “Somebody Gotta Die”: Jaylen Brown Assesses Jalen Duren ‘Mushing’ Moussa Diabate’s Face During Hornets-Pistons Brawl appeared first on The SportsRush.",

He is currently undergoing surgery at a local hospital. We will provide further updates when appropriate.\"\n\nIn a post on X, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie wrote:\n\n\"Any violent incident in our city is unacceptable, and I'm hoping Keion recovers quickly. I've spoken with SFPD and 49ers leadership- we are all grateful to our SFPD officers for their quick response. As always, I will continue working with San Francisco law enforcement to ensure our neighborhoods and our residents are safe.\"\n\nOn Monday morning, White took to his own social media to post a photo from the stands at the Super Bowl.\n\nComments on that post show an outpouring of support from fans after word had gotten out.\n\nOn the streets of the city near where the shooting happened, people who live there are also processing the news.\n\nElina Kang says she was woken up by the police activity outside her apartment.\n\n\"My window is right by my bed so I saw lights. I think that's why I woke up at first,\" said Kang.\n\nKang tells us she only moved to the area last week but knows it's had its problems with safety in the past.\n\n\"It kind of seems par for the course. I'm not entirely like how could this happen here,\" said Kang.\n\nThe San Francisco Police Department says the case remains open and no arrests have been made.\n\nWhite is the second 49ers player to be shot in the past 18 months, after wide receiver Ricky Pearsall who was shot in the chest during an armed robbery in Union Square.\n\nIf you're on the ABC7 News app, click here to watch live",

It was not great conditions last night, as it consistently always seems to be raining in the UK in 2026 so far!\n\nAttentions will switch back to the senior team now as the lads wake up this morning hoping to continue some very good form across the last games.\n\nLeeds are fighting to stay in the Premier League so they could present a tough opposition. But the reality is that Chelsea must win this game because they have a very tough run coming up after this one. It will tell us a lot about the manager and the players and where we are now at.",

Even so, the Germany international has come away impressed by the Belgian.\n\nSpeaking to Sky Germany, as captured by @iMiaSanMia, Tah talked about his head coach and what he does so well.\n\n“There are drills where he joins in or briefly demonstrates something. Not for very long, though. He makes a lot of corrections, and that makes you realize the details he pays attention to. These details can be tiny, but if you change them, the risk of conceding a goal is much lower. Just because you’ve adjusted a position. That’s really impressive,” said Tah.\n\nSo what has he learned from this detailed coaching? “Many details, but also how important it is to communicate on the pitch. That’s what he expects from me, but he emphasizes again and again how much you can compensate for with that. When the team is compact, when we have to defend deep, when the right time is to press high. The kind of communication he teaches us makes a huge difference on the pitch.”\n\nIt certainly helps to have a legendary center back as your coach to help improve as a center back, is it not?",

    "title": "North Dakota State, winner of 10 FCS titles, jumps to FBS to join Mountain West in football",
    "description": "North Dakota State, which won 10 of the last 15 championships in the FCS, will give the revamped Mountain West an even 10 members for football starting in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Perennial FCS power North Dakota State will move up to the FBS this season and join the Mountain West for football, confident that sustained success at the previous two levels can continue behind a hefty new investment in the program.\n\nNorth Dakota State, which won 10 of the last 15 championships in the FCS, will give the revamped Mountain West an even 10 members for football starting in 2026. The Bison went 12-1 in 2025, losing 29-28 at home in the second round of the playoffs to eventual runner-up Illinois State. They’re 9-5 all-time against FBS opponents.\n\n“One of the concerns was, ‘Will NDSU be competitive?’” interim university president Rick Berg said. “I think we will. Unlike others, we’ve been preparing for this moment for years and years, and I think they’re going to be surprised when NDSU hits the Mountain West.”\n\nNDSU must pay a $5 million reclassification fee to the NCAA for the move and a $12.5 million entry fee to the Mountain West, athletic director Matt Larsen confirmed at a news conference on Monday. Those costs will be privately funded by boosters and donors, Larsen said.\n\nIn addition, the program will need more scholarships and staff support and a bigger travel and recruiting budget. NDSU also won’t be able to fully access conference or College Football Playoff revenue until 2032 after the current media rights contracts expire. But in a state with no major professional sports franchises, the Bison enjoy robust fan support in the growing Fargo area along the state’s eastern border with Minnesota and from a proud network of alumni in the region. The university has about 9,700 undergraduate students this school year.\n\n“There’s going to be an increase, and it’s going to be a significant increase, but we’ll get it to a level where we can compete based on dollars in Fargo, North Dakota,” Larsen said.\n\nThe Bison moved all of their athletic teams to Division I in 2004, after winning eight NCAA Division II football titles.\n\n“The Bison bring a championship mindset and a bold vision for growth that aligns with the unwavering commitment to the excellence of the Mountain West. Their dedication to elevating the student-athlete experience — on the field, in the classroom, and throughout the community — will energize the Mountain West and help propel our football profile to new heights nationwide,” Mountain West Commissioner Gloria Nevarez said in a statement distributed by the conference.\n\nNorth Dakota State’s move will take effect on July 1, mirroring the departure Northern Illinois is making for football only from the Mid-American Conference. Texas-El Paso will become a full member for all sports starting with the 2026-27 school year, along with Hawaii, which was already playing football in the Mountain West. UC Davis, which will remain in the FCS, and Grand Canyon, which does not play football, will join the Mountain West for all sports except football.\n\nThe holdovers are Air Force, Nevada, New Mexico, San Jose State, UNLV and Wyoming. Departing the Mountain West for the rebuilt Pac-12 starting in 2026-27 are Boise State, Colorado State, Fresno State, San Diego State and Utah State, a move that has pitted the two conferences against each other in court over exit fees.\n\nNDSU will immediately play a full eight-game conference schedule but won’t be eligible for the Mountain West title game or the College Football Playoff until the 2028 season. For the next two years, they can only play in a bowl game if there aren’t enough eligible teams to fill all the spots, as Delaware and Missouri State were able to do in 2025.\n\nNorth Dakota State will remain in the Summit League in other sports for now. The Bison spent 18 seasons in the Missouri Valley Football Conference, winning 12 titles in the most consistently competitive FCS league. The MVFC sent six of its 10 teams to the FCS playoffs in 2025, including Illinois State, North Dakota, South Dakota, South Dakota State and Youngstown State.\n\nSouth Dakota State, which won FCS national titles in the 2022 and 2023 seasons, has played North Dakota State for the Dakota Marker Trophy since both programs moved to Division I in 2004. NDSU leads 12-10 in yet another college football trophy series that now has an unclear future. The Bison will play four non-conference games, but even some of the sport’s most hallowed rivalries have vanished when schools wind up in different leagues.\n\nNDSU will aim to play one team from a Power Four conference, two from the Group of Six conferences, and one from the FCS each season, Larsen said, leaving open the possibility to play at least one team from the current MVFC as the scheduling matrix allows moving forward.\n\n“That’s not something we would close the door on. I think we’d be open to playing just about anybody from an FCS perspective,” he said.",

    "fullText": "The only time Liverpool have control in midfield is when the opposition plays a low block.\n\nAnd even then it's pointless, as our play is slow and without ideas - so we keep the ball for possession's sake.\n\nAlexis Mac Allister is starting ahead of Curtis Jones but he shouldn't be. The Argentine has had a very poor season and he went completely missing in the first half against Manchester City.\n\nRyan Gravenberch can dribble but is a horrible passer, while our best midfielder, Dom Szoboszlai, is being wasted at right-back.\n\nA few years ago when Liverpool were having a poor season because of a defensive injury crisis, Jurgen Klopp decided to field Fabinho and Gini Wijnaldum at centre-back to get as many of his best players in the team as possible.\n\nIt didn't work and eventually he picked real centre-backs Rhys Williams and Nat Philipps and Liverpool went on to secure a top-four finish.\n\nSlot needs to do this now. Use Calvin Ramsay or Wataru Endo at right-back and let Szoboszlai play in midfield. Playing Mac Allister and Gravenberch, neither of whom provide stability, as a double pivot, is too dangerous - as proven by how City strolled through our centre in the first half.\n\nWe also have nothing off the bench. Hugo Ekitike is brilliant but after 70 minutes his legs run out every week.\n\nWhy Slot doesn't use his subs earlier I'll never know. He needs to put trust in his non-starters. He makes it so obvious he doesn't rate them.\n\nFind more from Jordan Chamberlain at Empire of the Kop",

    "fullText": "With FPL GW-26 fast approaching, choosing the right captain could be the difference between a green arrow and a frustrating red one.\n\nThis double game week presents some standout opportunities, especially with Arsenal assets firmly in the spotlight.\n\nBelow, I break down the best captain pick options for game week 26, highlighting form, fixtures, and multiple routes to points to help you make the smartest decision.\n\nIf you’re going into FPL game week 26 captain picks without an Arsenal player, Bruno Fernandes is a very strong alternative.\n\nHe’s currently in great form and remains Manchester United’s main creative and penalty threat.\n\nAn away fixture against West Ham offers plenty of upside, especially given Bruno’s consistency for minutes, chances created, and goal involvement.\n\nHe’s a safe yet explosive option for managers looking to captain outside of Arsenal.\n\nDeclan Rice stands out as one of the most well-rounded FPL GW-26 captain picks.\n\nHis appeal comes from multiple avenues to points: goals, assists, defensive contributions, and near-guaranteed minutes.\n\nUnlike some attacking assets, Rice offers reliability alongside upside, making him my top Arsenal choice.\n\nFor managers seeking balance and consistency, he is arguably the best captain pick option for game week 26 of the 2025/26 EPL season.\n\nOn paper, Gabriel may be the strongest of all FPL game week 26 captain picks. Arsenal face Brentford and Wolves, two fixtures that heavily favor defensive returns.\n\nGabriel offers a high likelihood of clean sheets, defensive contributions, and strong goal threat from set pieces.\n\nAgainst Brentford, he boasts 6 wins, 1 draw, and 5 clean sheets in 7 matches, while against Wolves he has recorded 6 clean sheets and scored 2 EPL goals.\n\nFor managers chasing maximum upside, Gabriel is an elite captaincy option this week.\n\nGW-26 is an excellent opportunity to activate your Triple Captain chip, especially on an Arsenal player. With strong fixtures and high expected returns, this could be the perfect moment to go all-in.",

The NFL Kickoff game was quite the dramatic start to the year as an early ejection as Eagles defensive tackle Jalen Carter was ejected from the game for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott.\n\nWhile the matchup was a defensive battle, the reigning champions took a 24-20 victory over Dallas to begin the 2025 season.\n\nThe Chargers competed in the international opener against the Kansas City Chiefs in São Paulo, Brazil. The Bolts earned a 27-21 win over their AFC West rivals to kick off the season.\n\nThe Week 1 thriller featured the best of Justin Herbert as he threw for 318 yards and three touchdowns.\n\nIt was a statement win for the Bolts and the team will look to continue making waves in 2026, potentially starting the year against the Seahawks at Lumen Field.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: Chargers are candidate to play in the 2026 NFL season opener",

    "description": "Pitt and its women's basketball coach Tory Verdi are being sued by six former players who allege he created a \"hostile, discriminatory,\" environment.",
    "fullText": "Six former women’s basketball players from the University of Pittsburgh are suing the school and its coach, Tory Verdi.\n\nThe six individual civil suits were filed in the U.S. District Court for Western Pennsylvania on Friday, Feb. 6. Each player is represented by the same attorney, Keenan Holmes. Each suit alleges Title IX violations and that Verdi inflicted \"emotional, psychological, and physical abuse\" against the players and that he created a “hostile, discriminatory, and retaliatory environment.\"\n\nMuch of the allegations in the six lawsuits — which USA TODAY Sports obtained copies of — read similarly and cite the same instances to back up their allegations that Verdi “weaponized his authority to manipulate, demean, and emotionally destabilize players through targeted mistreatment, verbal abuse, gaslighting, and retaliatory conduct.”\n\n“Verdi used his position of authority to engage in emotionally abusive conduct, retaliation, and psychological manipulation that transcended poor coaching and entered into constitutional violations,” one lawsuits reads. “The program was defined by fear and emotional volatility as players were routinely demeaned, psychologically isolated, and pressured to perform under abusive conditions.”\n\nSpokespersons for Pitt’s athletic department did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday night.\n\nThe lawsuits were filed by Favor Ayodele, Raeven Boswell, Makayla Elmore, Brooklynn Miles, Isabella Perkins and Jasmine Timmerson. Their suits also claim that Pitt knew about the players’ complaints about Verdi, but took no action.\n\nConcerns, according to the lawsuits, were raised with Senior Woman Administrator Jennifer Tuscano, former athletic director Heather Lyke, and Laurel Gift — Pitt’s Assistant Vice Chancellor for Compliance, Investigations, and Ethics. Lyke is now the Special Advisor to the Chancellor and Athletic Director at Syracuse.\n\nOften the first specific incident cited in the lawsuits is one that allegedly occurred after a practice during the 2023-24 season when Verdi told the team, “Every night I lay in bed I want to kill myself because of you.” The former players say this “caused fear, emotional distress, and confusion among players.”\n\nThe lawsuits cite another incident where, before playing a game against Clemson, Verdi allegedly “directed xenophobic and culturally insensitive remarks” toward a foreign-born player, telling her to “go back home because ICE is coming.” One lawsuit claims that Verdi told foreign-born players, “We speak English here,” when they would use their native languages or accents.\n\nIn her lawsuit, Perkins alleges that Verdi once told her during the summer of 2024 in a private meeting, “I don’t like you as a player, but I’d let my son date you.”\n\nPerkins also says that she was “routinely denied adequate medical care” and forced to play while injured. Perkins said she confided in the team doctor about the “hostile and abusive environment perpetuated by Coach Verdi.” That disclosure was reported to Verdi, Perkins alleges, and it was met with retaliation. Perkins adds that her request for a medical redshirt was denied because Pitt mishandled her submission to the ACC.\n\nOther allegations made in the lawsuits include Verdi berating the team after the death of one player’s father, allegedly telling them, “I knew you guys were bad basketball players, but I didn’t know you were bad people too.”\n\nThe players also claim that Verdi mocked one player’s appearance and weight, telling her “you look pregnant,” while she was recovering from injury. The six players also claim that Verdi “intentionally created and exploited racial division” and that “players of color were subjected to harsher discipline, less patience, and fewer opportunities than similarly situated white teammates.”\n\nOne former player, Elmore, says she “made a good-faith report” to Pitt's compliance office regarding repeated NCAA practice-hour violations by Verdi. Elmore claims that the compliance office disclosed her identity to Verdi and nothing was done.\n\nAnother former player, Ayodele, says that when she was injured, Verdi didn’t speak to her for nearly six months and ignored “her medical and emotional needs and isolating her from team support.”\n\nSome of the former players say they have had to seek mental health treatment and therapy after playing for Verdi. The plaintiffs are seeking monetary damages and a declaration that Pitt violated Title IX.\n\nVerdi is in his third season coaching the Panthers, who currently have an overall record of 8-17, a mark that includes a loss to Division III Scranton. He has a record of 29-60 while leading Pitt. The Panthers have not posted a winning record in ACC play since the 2014-15 season, which is also the last time they made the NCAA tournament.\n\nPreviously, Verdi was the head coach at UMass and Eastern Michigan, where he won a combined 200 games. Verdi signed a six-year contract with Pitt when he was hired in 2023.\n\nRiding an eight-game losing streak, Pitt is scheduled to play again on Thursday night at home against Syracuse.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Pitt women's basketball coach accused of abuse in lawsuits by players",

    "fullText": "Manchester United’s Marcus Rashford has been impressing in Spain for FC Barcelona.\n\nThe 28-year-old has taken to life in La Liga like a duck to water, contributing to 23 goals in all competitions.\n\nRashford is currently on loan at the Catalan club, but it seems likely he will stay permanently after the summer.\n\nThere were rumours that the departure of Ruben Amorim as manager at Old Trafford might see him make a return.\n\nNonetheless, recent reports have refuted this and only confirmed his desire to stay and Barcelona’s ambition to make the deal permanent this summer for £30.3 million.\n\nIt seems that Rashford is not only impressing Barcelona fans, but his form is also attracting the attention of some of his former teammates at United.\n\nMundo Deportivo reports that, “the England international winger’s performance for the Blaugrana has generated both surprise and delight in British football circles.”\n\nThe Spanish media outlet was also incredibly complimentary of Rashford’s performance versus RCD Mallorca at the weekend, where “he shouldered much of the attacking responsibility for the league leaders during the most crucial moments of the game.”\n\nThe paper points out that after winning the Super Cup in January, some of Rashford’s former teammates took to social media to congratulate him on the victory.\n\nFormer captain Harry Maguire posted, “I love it, mate,” accompanying his comment with a clapping emoji.\n\nThe current club captain, Bruno Fernandes, penned “Congratulations, brother” and added a red heart emoji.\n\nDutch striker Joshua Zirkzee also got in on the act, posting, “Congratulations, brother.”\n\nFC Barcelona and Rashford will next be in action when they travel to Atletico Madrid in the first leg of the Copa del Rey semi-final on Thursday evening.\n\nFeature image Clive Mason via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Liverpool spent £450m last summer on new players as Arne Slot and Richard Hughes set about retaining the Premier League title.\n\nAmong the new arrivals were Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak - coming in on British-record deals. Also added was Hugo Ekitike up front - as the head coach and sporting director overhauled the frontline.\n\nSeveral players in attack had to make way to accommodate the new faces - including Darwin Nunez, Luis Diaz and Ben Gannon-Doak.\n\nThat helped the club towards a figure approaching £200m in sales - but there are signs that another clearout may be on the horizon.\n\nNew faces are coming next summer - with Jeremy Jacquet already secured and a winger set to be announced too. And in order to make space for those arrivals more current Liverpool stars are going to be leaving.\n\nShop the goalkeeper range today\n\nShop the third kit range today!\n\nWe could see the likes of Ibrahima Konate, Andy Robertson, Curtis Jones and Mohamed Salah among the departures as Hughes and Slot plot improvements across the squad.\n\nThe Italian, 28, arrived on an initial £10m deal from Juventus back in September 2024. Despite winning the Premier League title the winger has endured a difficult spell on Merseyside - never looking like he was going to decisively win over Slot.\n\nJuventus were heavily linked with a move for their former player in January but that deal ran aground as the Reds were seeking a permanent move rather than a loan.\n\nNow the club’s demands have been set out in a new report from Caught Offside - which claims that Juventus, Napoli and Roma are set to contest the signature of the Italy international.\n\nLiverpool’s price range for a summer deal for Chiesa has now reached between £21 and £26m according to the report.\n\n“The Liverpool board is “open to letting him go”, with doubts about his ability to adapt to the Premier League pace, while Serie A sides are already moving in for Chiesa,” the report reads.\n\nThat is a mammoth sum for a fringe player - and it could represent a clear £16m profit on Chiesa. The Premier League champions are relatively well protected from a transfer fee perspective with the versatile forward contracted until 2028.\n\nBut Hughes needs to be careful that he doesn’t price the £150k per week forward out of a move completely. Chiesa has made just THREE Premier League starts under Slot since arriving at the club at the start of last season.\n\nIt is unlikely that his track record at Anfield is going to attract bids quite that high and so the LFC executive might need to come to a compromise.",

    "fullText": "Leeds United will look to continue their exciting run of form when they travel to face resurgent Chelsea on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Whites arrive in a confident mood following an impressive victory at Elland Road over the weekend.\n\nHowever, Leeds face a significant test against a Chelsea side enjoying a perfect Premier League record under new boss Liam Rosenior.\n\nWhile the hosts are pushing for Champions League qualification, Leeds are focused on pulling further clear of the relegation battle, setting up a clash with plenty at stake.\n\nLeeds have shown clear signs of progress in recent weeks, winning three of their last five league matches.\n\nTheir latest outing saw them claim a commanding 3-1 triumph over Nottingham Forest in West Yorkshire.\n\nDaniel Farke’s side raced into a three-goal lead through Jayden Bogle, Noah Okafor and Dominic Calvert-Lewin, with the latter continuing his productive campaign.\n\nLeeds currently sit 16th in the table and hold a six-point cushion above the relegation zone.\n\nAnother positive result against Chelsea would significantly strengthen their survival hopes as the season moves towards its final stretch.\n\nMeanwhile, Chelsea have rediscovered momentum under Rosenior. The Blues have won each of their four Premier League fixtures since his arrival.\n\nOver the weekend, they claimed an eye-catching 3-1 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers, powered by Cole Palmer’s historic first-half hat-trick.\n\nThe West London side sits fifth in the standings and remains firmly in the race for a top-four finish.\n\nHowever, Chelsea have struggled in midweek fixtures this season and will be wary of Leeds, who already beat them 3-1 earlier in the campaign.\n\nChelsea are unbeaten in their last seven home league games against Leeds, winning the previous six meetings at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe Whites last recorded a victory at the ground in 1999.\n\nLeeds are chasing a league double over Chelsea for the first time since their title-winning 1991/92 campaign.\n\nChelsea are winless in their three midweek Premier League fixtures this season.\n\nLeeds have lost seven of their 12 league matches away from home this term, collecting just seven points on their travels.\n\nFarke is expected to keep faith with the side that impressed over the weekend. The German tactician has largely benefited from a near fully-fit squad heading into the clash.\n\nAnton Stach, 27, remains Leeds’ main injury concern as he continues to struggle with a hip problem.\n\nDan James has returned to the matchday squad and is pushing for his first start since November after recovering from a hamstring injury.\n\nCalvert-Lewin is set to spearhead the attack once again, supported by Okafor, who should retain his place in the XI.\n\nLauded by Farke as a player with ‘special ability’, Okaford could prove decisive in West London.\n\nKarl Darlow; Joe Rodon, Pascal Struijk, James Justin; Jayden Bogle, Brenden Aaronson, Ethan Ampadu, Ilia Gruev, Gudmundsson; Dominic Calvert-Lewin, Noah Okafor.",

    "fullText": "West Ham United will aim to continue their survival push when they host in-form Manchester United at the London Stadium on Tuesday evening.\n\nThe Hammers head into the contest buoyed by a weekend victory, but they face a daunting challenge against a rejuvenated side on a remarkable run under Michael Carrick.\n\nWith West Ham and Man Utd chasing vastly different objectives, the clash promises to carry major significance at both ends of the Premier League table.\n\nWest Ham have shown encouraging signs of life in recent weeks, winning three of their last four league matches.\n\nThe Hammers sealed a vital 2-0 victory away at relegation rivals Burnley, boosting their hopes of climbing out of the bottom three.\n\nFirst-half strikes from Crysencio Summerville and new signing Valentin Castellanos proved decisive.\n\nThe result leaves Nuno Espirito Santo’s side just three points from safety as the campaign enters a crucial phase.\n\nDespite their recent resurgence, West Ham’s home record remains a concern.\n\nThe Hammers have won just four of their last 20 Premier League games at the London Stadium.\n\nHowever, they will draw confidence from their recent record against United, having won their last three home league meetings against the Red Devils.\n\nMeanwhile, United arrive in exceptional form under caretaker boss Carrick, who has overseen four consecutive Premier League victories.\n\nUnited strengthened their top-four credentials with a 2-0 win over Tottenham Hotspur last time out, following notable wins against Manchester City, Arsenal and Fulham.\n\nUnited currently sit fourth in the standings and remain firmly in the race for Champions League qualification.\n\nCarrick’s side have also impressed away from home, losing just one of their last nine league matches on the road. West Ham have a mountain to climb.\n\nWest Ham have won each of their last three home league matches against Manchester United.\n\nThe Red Devils have lost four of their last six Premier League games against the Irons.\n\nWest Ham completed a league double over United last season and drew 1-1 at Old Trafford earlier this campaign.\n\nThe Hammers have lost only three of their last 15 midweek Premier League home fixtures, while United have won just one of their last nine midweek away league matches.\n\nNuno will again be without Jean-Clair Todibo, who serves the second match of his suspension following his recent red card.\n\nLukasz Fabianski also remains sidelined with a back injury.\n\nAxel Disasi is expected to continue in defence after making his debut against Burnley, likely partnering Dinos Mavropanos at centre-back.\n\nNuno said he did ‘really well’ versus Burnley, and he should get the starting berth.

They have collected just eight points from their last eight league matches at the Hill Dickinson Stadium.\n\nHaving secured a 1-0 victory away at Bournemouth earlier in the campaign, David Moyes’ side will be eager to complete a league double over the Cherries for the first time.\n\nMeanwhile, Bournemouth continue to impress under Andoni Iraola despite losing key attacker Antoine Semenyo during the winter transfer window.\n\nThe Cherries are unbeaten in their last five league fixtures and earned a credible 1-1 draw against title-chasing Aston Villa last time out.\n\nThe visitors sit 11th in the table and could leapfrog Everton with a convincing victory.\n\nWhile Bournemouth’s attacking output on the road has been impressive, defensive vulnerabilities have limited their progress away from home.\n\nBournemouth have lost six of their eight away league games against Everton, although they staged a 3-2 comeback win in this fixture last season.\n\nEach of the last four Premier League meetings between the sides has been goalless at half-time, with the last 11 goals in this fixture arriving after the interval.\n\nEverton have won both of their Tuesday Premier League fixtures this season, while Bournemouth have won only one of their last eight midweek Premier League matches.\n\nMoyes is dealing with just one confirmed absentee in Jack Grealish.\n\nHe is expected to miss the remainder of the season after sustaining an ankle injury that could require surgery.\n\nJarrad Branthwaite has returned to fitness following a hamstring problem, creating competition in central defence alongside Michael Keane and James Tarkowski.\n\nKeane impressed during Everton’s recent defensive run and may retain his place in the starting line-up.\n\nMeanwhile, 19-year-old Harrison Armstrong should continue in attack.\n\nJordan Pickford; Jake O’Brien, James Tarkowski, Michael Keane, Vitaliy Mykolenko; James Garner, Idrissa Gueye; Harrison Armstrong, Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall, Iliman Ndiaye; Thierno Barry.",

    "fullText": "Nick Woltemade had his cap pulled over his eyes as he left the Stadium of Light.\n\nBut there was no way the towering Newcastle United forward - all 6ft 6in of him - was going to slip out of the stadium unnoticed.\n\nNot after his own goal settled the Wear-Tyne derby a couple of months ago.\n\nWoltemade's team-mates were booed by the Sunderland supporters gathered outside as they climbed on to the team bus - but Woltemade was applauded, cheered and even serenaded with chants of \"Hero! Hero! Hero!\" after inadvertently heading Newcastle's bitter rivals to a 1-0 victory back in December.\n\nSome players might have taken a bit of time to come back from a blow like that.\n\nBut Woltemade responded in immediate and emphatic fashion, scoring a first-half double against Chelsea in his next Newcastle start less than a week later.\n\nIt was a sign of his mental strength, and Woltemade has had to draw on those reserves of resilience lately after failing to find the back of the net for Eddie Howe's side since December.\n\n\"He started so well,\" the Newcastle head coach said. \"Everyone expected him to continue. As much as we wanted that for him, that's very difficult to do.\"\n\nSo why have the goals dried up for the Germany forward?\n\nI'd resign if I wasn't still right for job - Howe\n\n'I'm not doing my job well enough' - but is Howe now under pressure?\n\nIt is a question few could have imagined asking not so long ago.\n\nNot after Woltemade scored six goals from his first six efforts on target for the club, including bullet headers against Arsenal and Wolves, an audacious flick against Union Saint-Gilloise and a stunning backheel at Brighton.\n\nSuch an instant impact even took Woltemade by surprise following his £69m move from Stuttgart in the final days of the summer window.\n\nBut it got to the stage where the German went into every game firmly believing he would find the back of the net.\n\nEven those closest to Woltemade were taken aback by the devastating manner in which he dispatched a penalty against Nottingham Forest in a 2-0 victory back in October.\n\nHowever, it was never going to be sustainable for Woltemade to keep scoring at such a clinical rate, particularly when he was relied upon to do so while fellow forward Yoane Wissa recovered from a knee injury.\n\nWissa has since returned to ease the burden, but the pair are both struggling in front of goal during an intense run of fixtures.\n\nThe schedule for club and country has been unrelenting, which has limited the amount of time Woltemade has had to properly work with the coaching staff on the training pitches.\n\nThat has been huge frustration internally as Newcastle continue to adapt following the departure of a very different type of striker in Alexander Isak, who joined Liverpool last summer.\n\nBut Woltemade is understood to be calm about his goal drought.\n\nSuch is his character, the forward is more concerned about Newcastle getting back to winning ways following a run of one victory in eight matches in all competitions.\n\nIt is also easy to forget that Woltemade is still only 23.\n\nHe only became a regular starter at Stuttgart in December 2024, before joining Newcastle a few months later after the club missed out on, among others, Hugo Ekitike, Joao Pedro and Benjamin Sesko.\n\nHe had not played outside his homeland before, and had to quickly adapt to the speed and physicality of the Premier League, as well as a system previously tailored to a rapid striker who led the defensive press from the front and ran in behind, which is not Woltemade's game.\n\nThe Bundesliga is fierce in its own right, but it is rather telling that Woltemade has only been awarded four fouls in his last 11 top-flight fixtures.\n\nPremier League analysts and defenders now have had a greater body of work to study in order to try to limit his influence in this Newcastle side compared to earlier in the campaign.\n\nThere have been times where Woltemade has not been in the box - lacking those instincts a traditional poacher has - and other occasions where he has looked isolated up front and not had enough runners near him, which is down to the way Newcastle have been set up.\n\nNo wonder, then, Woltemade is only averaging 1.9 shots per game in the league this season.\n\nWoltemade failed to even hit the target with a couple of headers from his most recent chances in front of goal, against Wolves last month, but service has also clearly been an issue for a player who thrives off balls to feet.\n\nAlthough Newcastle lead the way for crosses in the Premier League (637), only eight top-flight sides have a worse crossing accuracy (21.5%).\n\nAlso, rather than being a traditional target man who plays with his back to goal, the technical Woltemade looks most comfortable operating in the spaces between the midfield and the box.\n\nIt was from these areas that at Stuttgart he often showcased a unique ability - for someone so tall to dribble past defenders and link up with those around him.\n\nHowe fielded Woltemade in such a role behind Wissa in a 4-2-3-1 against Bournemouth last month and revisited the experiment as Newcastle attempted to get back into the game in the second half versus Brentford at the weekend.\n\nBut the head coach readily admitted his attack has \"not quite functioned fully yet\" as he attempts to bed his summer signings \"into the team format\".\n\n\"Nick has done everything with such a great attitude,\" he said. \"That's the biggest thing, for me, that means he will continue to be successful.\"\n\nLatest Newcastle news, analysis and fan views\n\nAsk about Newcastle - what do you want to know?",

    "title": "Can you rewire your brain?",
    "description": "The metaphor of rewiring offers an ideal of engineered precision. But the brain is more like a forest than a circuit board",
    "fullText": "Structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) of a human brain. The data was processed to show the affinity between the ‘flesh’ of the brain and the ‘flesh’ of the head. Image by Parashkev Nachev/Wellcome Collection\n\nPopular wisdom holds we can ‘rewire’ our brains: after a stroke, after trauma, after learning a new skill, even with 10 minutes a day on the right app. The phrase is everywhere, offering something most of us want to believe: that when the brain suffers an assault, it can be restored with mechanical precision. But ‘rewiring’ is a risky metaphor. It borrows its confidence from engineering, where a faulty system can be repaired by swapping out the right component; it also smuggles that confidence into biology, where change is slower, messier and often incomplete. The phrase has become a cultural mantra that is easier to comprehend than the scientific term, neuroplasticity – the brain’s ability to change and form new neural connections throughout life.\n\nBut what does it really mean to ‘rewire’ the brain? Is it a helpful shorthand for describing the remarkable plasticity of our nervous system or has it become a misleading oversimplification that distorts our grasp of science?\n\nAfter all, ‘rewiring your brain’ sounds like more than metaphor. It implies an engineering project: a system whose parts can be removed, replaced and optimised. The promise is both alluring and oddly mechanical. The metaphor actually did come from engineering. To an engineer, rewiring means replacing old and faulty circuits with new ones. As the vocabulary of technology crept into everyday life, it brought with it a new way of thinking about the human mind.\n\nMedical roots of the phrase trace back to 1912, when the British surgeon W Deane Butcher compared the body’s neural system to a house’s electrical wiring, describing how nerves connect to muscles much like wires connect appliances to a power source. By the 1920s, the Harvard psychologist Leonard Troland was referring to the visual system as ‘an extremely intricate telegraphic system’, reinforcing the comparison between brain function and electrical networks.\n\nThe metaphor of rewiring also draws strength from changing theories in developmental neuroscience. The brain was thought to be largely static after childhood, becoming a fixed network of circuits, much like a hardwired radio. But beginning in the 1960s, researchers showed that the brain was far more adaptable. Stroke patients could regain function by recruiting new areas of the brain.\n\nThese findings revolutionised rehabilitation medicine. They also gave rise to an idea that would quickly leap beyond the clinic: if brains can rewire, then people can change.\n\nMore recently, the metaphor of neural rewiring has gained popularity alongside new imaging techniques like fMRI and PET scans, which allow researchers to see brain activity in ways never before possible. In studies of stroke recovery, clinicians often observe increased activation in brain regions adjacent to or distant from the area of damage. This is interpreted as the brain ‘rewiring’ itself to restore lost function. Popular science writers have embraced the metaphor as well, using it to explain everything from trauma healing to learning a second language.\n\nBut unlike electrical wiring, which follows rigid, fixed paths, the brain’s connectivity is dynamic and constantly changing. Neurons form and prune synapses – the connections between them – in response to activity and environment, a process governed by complex biochemical signalling rather than simple rerouting. Even when we can map the parts, the picture doesn’t explain the self. As late as 2013, Francis Collins, the then-director of the US National Institutes of Health (NIH), complained about studies on mapping the brain, in an interview with NPR (US National Public Radio): ‘It’d be like, you know, taking your laptop and prying the top off and staring at the parts inside, you’d be able to say, yeah, this is connected to that, but you wouldn’t know how it worked.’\n\nTo evaluate the metaphor, it’s important to grasp how brain plasticity actually works. We already know a lot about the brain’s remarkable ability to reorganise itself throughout life by forming new neural connections, strengthening existing ones or rerouting functions to undamaged areas. But the logic of neuroplasticity isn’t the same as swapping one wire with another. It’s more like a living forest where paths are gradually worn or abandoned based on use. It involves changes at the cellular level and can occur in response to learning, memory, sensory input and trauma. Importantly, while neuroplasticity is a lifelong feature of the brain, it is more robust during youth and becomes more effort-dependent with age.\n\nThis capacity allows the brain to adapt to new experiences, recover from injuries, learn new information and compensate for lost functions. Neuroplasticity is real, but it’s not magic. It has limits. It requires effort. And it doesn’t always result in perfect recovery or transformation.\n\nUnlike rewiring a machine, plasticity is not as simple as replacing parts. It’s a gradual process and is often inefficient. Synapses, which pass signals between neurons, strengthen or weaken. New dendritic branches – neurons’ treelike extensions – grow while others retract. Entire networks shift their activity over time, but only under the right conditions, and these changes accumulate to support new patterns of function while overall mechanisms become less efficient across the lifespan.\n\nPlasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking\n\nPlasticity happens throughout life, but it’s shaped by many factors: age, environment, repetition, rest, nutrition and emotional state. For example: with months of targeted physical therapy, a stroke survivor can regain movement in a limb by recruiting healthier networks; with intensive, structured practice, a child with dyslexia can gradually develop new reading pathways; and reading braille requires extensive practice and is instrumental in changing relevant brain regions.\n\nIn cases of childhood trauma, certain survival pathways, such as hypervigilance or emotional detachment, may become dominant and reinforced over time. Later in life, therapy may promote the strengthening of alternative circuits related to trust, emotional regulation or self-awareness. But the old pathways aren’t necessarily erased. They remain in the background, potentially reactivated under stress. The idea that the brain is ‘rewired’ to function in a healthier way may offer hope, but it oversimplifies the reality. We build new trails, but the old ones don’t necessarily disappear.\n\nExperience is a major force in shaping the nervous system. But, as the neuroscientists Bryan Kolb and Ian Whishaw argue in their widely cited review of brain plasticity, it always works in context. Over a lifetime, experience ‘alters the synaptic organisation of the brain’, but the brain’s response is also shaped by age, hormones, trophic factors (support proteins), stress, and illness or injury. And because the neocortex can ‘modify its function throughout one’s lifetime’, the same experience can leave different traces in different bodies, at different ages. Kolb and Whishaw capture the broader principle in a line worth keeping: ‘experience can modify brain structure long after brain development is complete’, and those physical changes are widely thought to be part of how memories are stored. In other words, plasticity is conditional, uneven and shaped by circumstance, not wishful thinking.\n\nThe same review paper makes a critical observation based on careful studies of rats recovering from injury: the evidence suggests that what looks like recovery at first glance is often the brain finding a workaround. In their words, ‘much of what appears … to be recovery is actually a compensatory substitution of new movements for lost movements.’ In plain terms, the brain is often building a detour, not restoring the same old route.\n\nThe fact that neurons can expand their reach means that, if some of them die, others may broaden their territory to make up for lost processing. In general, the more connections a neuron has, the more it can shape behaviour.\n\nBeyond this, a feedback loop seems to be at work. There is evidence that the environment can change which genes are switched on in the adult brain. One likely route runs through neural activity shaped by experience. Novel experience causes neurons to fire in new patterns; and those neurons in turn can trigger gene programmes that support dendritic and synaptic growth – structural changes that can, over time, shift behaviour. Some of these genes are known to be associated with learning and memory; others are linked to age-related memory deficits. So enrichment can certainly support the brain.\n\nExamples of neuroplasticity abound. During my neurology residency, one of my teachers, a highly specialised neuro-ophthalmologist, demonstrated the adaptability of the brain in a dramatic way. He recreated an informal experiment on himself by wearing glasses that flipped his visual field upside down. At first, he was disoriented. But within weeks, his brain recalibrated, and he was able to function normally in his environment. Even more remarkable was the re-adaptation that occurred when he removed the glasses; his world once again appeared inverted, and it took additional time for his perception to return to baseline. He later recreated another experiment by repeating the process with another set of glasses that reversed left and right, and he reported that this lateral inversion was far more difficult for the brain to compensate for than the vertical one. The experiment demonstrates how the brain adapts by recalibration rather than by restoring an original state, treating the altered input as normal over time.\n\nThe ability to alter speech is another testament to the plasticity of the brain. One fascinating distinction in neuroscience is that speech and singing use different neural pathways. For example, some well-known singers stutter when speaking but not when singing. Elvis Presley famously had a stutter that disappeared when he sang. Ed Sheeran also stuttered as a child and tried many techniques to overcome it. Nothing worked, until, at age nine, he began rapping along to an Eminem album. Through repetition, his fluency improved. Similarly, the country singer Mel Tillis spoke with a stutter but sang fluidly. In each case, fluency emerges not through repair but through recruitment of alternative circuits.\n\nThere’s also the curious case of singers who speak with strong accents but who lose them when they sing. Examples include Ozzy Osbourne, Adele, Ed Sheeran, ABBA and Freddie Mercury. Singing slows speech, elongates vowels and reduces accent markers. Many artists adopt American accents in songs due to the US roots of pop and rock music. The shift again reflects a change in network engagement rather than a permanent alteration of underlying language systems.\n\nAcross the lifespan, brains that are challenged tend to retain greater flexibility\n\nThis difference between speech and song forms the basis of a therapeutic approach known as melodic intonation therapy (MIT). It’s often used with patients suffering from non-fluent aphasia after a stroke, that is, those who can’t speak due to damage in the brain’s speech centres. In MIT, patients sing familiar childhood songs deeply encoded in emotional memory. Remarkably, they are often able to sing words and phrases they cannot otherwise speak. With repetition, speech improves. This is because singing activates preserved right-brain circuits, creating alternative pathways that gradually strengthen the brain’s overall language network. The gain comes through detour and reinforcement, not restoration of the damaged pathway.\n\nRecent research suggests that addiction may, in part, be a wiring issue in the brain. One promising treatment is transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), a noninvasive therapy that uses powerful magnetic pulses discharged above the skull to activate specific brain regions. Depending on where the stimulation is applied, it can trigger muscle movement or, more significantly, influence behaviour.\n\nTwo leading theories for the potential of TMS have emerged. One proposes that addiction stems from insufficient or underactive brain wiring, like that which occurs in stroke patients, and that stimulation reactivates dormant circuits. The other – more consistent with what we see in rehabilitation – suggests that damaged or dysregulated circuits are bypassed by strengthening alternative pathways, effectively rerouting brain activity. This ‘detour’ mechanism has been observed in stroke rehabilitation and may apply to addiction as well. TMS has been used in patients addicted to cocaine, and early evidence suggests that several weeks of treatment may be effective in reducing cravings and use.\n\nWhile neuroplasticity resists shortcuts, it does respond to sustained engagement. Across the lifespan, brains that are challenged – cognitively, socially, physically – tend to retain greater flexibility than those that are not. This is not because any single activity ‘rewires’ a specific circuit, but because varied, effortful experiences repeatedly recruit overlapping networks: attention, memory, movement, emotion. Learning a new language, for example, activates distributed regions across both hemispheres, linking auditory perception, working memory, and executive control. Playing a musical instrument does something similar, coupling fine motor coordination with timing, prediction, and emotional recall. Over time, these demands encourage structural and functional changes that support what neuroscientists call cognitive reserve: the brain’s ability to compensate when injury or degeneration occurs.\n\nThe same principle applies beyond formal learning. Singing engages breath, rhythm, language and affect in ways that ordinary speech does not, which is why it can support recovery in some stroke and Parkinson’s patients. Physical activity – especially aerobic exercise – improves cerebral blood flow and is associated with changes in the volume of the hippocampus, a region critical for turning short-term memory into long-term memory. It’s also one of the few brain regions where new neurons are generated in adulthood. Social interaction recruits emotional and linguistic circuits simultaneously, offering a kind of neural cross-training that solitary exercises cannot. Even seemingly modest skills, such as learning to juggle, have been shown to induce measurable changes in grey matter after weeks of practice. None of these activities function as targeted neural ‘fixes’. Their value lies instead in repetition, novelty and sustained effort – the slow conditions under which plasticity operates. They do not override biology but work with it, nudging the brain toward adaptation rather than transformation.\n\nGiven what we know about brain plasticity, the overarching claims of brain rewiring often misrepresent both the pace and the nature of neural change. In his guide Rewire Your Brain: Think Your Way to a Better Life (2010), the psychologist John B Arden declares that our brains are not ‘hardwired’ but rather ‘soft-wired’ by experience, and promises strategies to help readers ‘rewire’ their brains so that they can ‘feel calm and positive’ and ‘enhance’ their relationships. The neurologist Philippe Douyon’s book Neuroplasticity: Your Brain’s Superpower: Change Your Brain and Change Your Life (2019) explores how ‘we can give our brains exactly what they need to adapt, heal, and thrive’. The language varies, but the promise is consistent: targeted practices can reliably produce targeted psychological outcomes.\n\nThen there are the brain-rewiring apps. An apt example is Quit Addiction – Rewire Brain, which is geared toward breaking addictions like smoking, vaping or alcohol by combining habit-tracking, motivation tools and progress-monitoring in order to ‘rewire your brain for lasting change’. Across platforms, the metaphor suggests speed, precision and personal control – qualities that biology itself rarely affords.\n\nAnd TED Talks can overstate the case. As the neuroscientist Michael Merzenich explained in his presentation in 2004, the brain’s circuitry is not fixed: the adult brain, in fact, retains a ‘lifelong capacity for plasticity’ which ‘is powerfully expressed’. He later described what takes place within the brain:\n\nThe science is sound, but its popular reception often strips away the conditions – time, repetition, constraint – under which such change occurs.\n\nTo be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression\n\nMerzenich traced this discovery from critical periods in early childhood (when language and vision are calibrated) to adult therapies that retrain neural maps for speech and reading disorders. The key message was simple and striking: plasticity never switches off; it can be accomplished well into adulthood.\n\nMore than a decade later, the neuroscientist Don Vaughn took the stage at TEDxUCLA with a more applied vision. In ‘Neurohacking: Rewiring Your Brain’ (2015), he showcased how emerging tools allow people to consciously shape that plasticity. He described patients receiving non-invasive brain stimulation for depression, parents using apps that translate baby cries into visual signals, and volunteers who learned to self-modulate their brain rhythms through neurofeedback. ‘If we can rewire your brain using devices, would it at all be possible to help your brain rewire itself with just your own thoughts?’ The question captures the cultural leap – from biological possibility to personal mastery.\n\nTaken together, Merzenich’s foundational science and Vaughn’s demonstrations underscore why the phrase ‘rewiring the brain’ has become so potent in popular culture: it gestures not only to the metaphorical promise of self-improvement but also to a concrete, testable biology – the brain’s architecture is malleable and, under the right conditions, it can be reshaped. Yet embedded in these slogans are sweeping assumptions about how the brain works, assumptions that are often oversimplified or outright incorrect. One is the idea of rapid transformation: when an app promises that a week of short audio lessons can ‘rewire’ the brain, it compresses the slow, cumulative processes of learning and adaptation into a quick-fix model. Another is that change is total; to be ‘rewired’ suggests an all-or-nothing overhaul rather than nuanced progression, as if old circuitry can be removed and replaced wholesale. A third is precision targeting, where the discourse tacitly promises that specific practices – such as gratitude exercises or productivity hacks – strike exactly the right neural pathways to produce specific psychological outcomes. All three assumptions resonate with our technological imagination; none align with the messy realities of neuroplasticity.\n\nIn short, the metaphor is powerful but problematic. It suggests that, no matter where someone begins their process, whether recovering from a head trauma or battling cognitive decline, the brain can snap back to normal. There’s a certain poetry to that idea. A reassurance that we are not static beings and that transformation is possible at any age.\n\nThere are contexts where this has value. It can help patients understand that their brains are not static or irreparably broken. It frames recovery as active rather than passive, encouraging participation in therapies that promote healing. Educators have also embraced the metaphor when teaching students. The idea that you can rewire your brain reinforces the possibility of learning and change. In clinical settings, it can reduce shame and fatalism.\n\nHowever, for stroke survivors, the promise of rewiring can be both inspiring and unrealistic. Some regain remarkable function; others plateau despite intense therapy. In Alzheimer’s, the degenerative nature of the disease limits the brain’s plasticity. In such contexts, rewiring may imply a level of control or optimism that the brain itself does not always permit. Hope matters. But so does honesty.\n\nMetaphors can motivate, but they can also mislead. The notion that someone can rewire their brain through sheer willpower, self-help books or 10 minutes of daily meditation risks turning serious neurological change into a gimmick. While cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and physical rehabilitation have strong evidence supporting their effects on brain function, these changes occur over time and have biological constraints.\n\nThe brain is not a circuit board. Changing it is not as simple as swapping a wire or updating software. ‘Rewiring’ implies speed and precision, a single tweak that creates a desired result; it implies that changes in the brain are mechanical and always possible, none of which is guaranteed. The reality of neuroplasticity is far messier: it’s a biological process that is incremental and frustratingly slow. And while science does support the idea that the brain can change, it also reminds us that change comes at a cost. It requires time and effort, and sometimes it ends in failure.\n\nThe metaphor turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw\n\nHere’s where the metaphor of rewiring starts to do damage. It suggests that brain changes are mechanical and under direct conscious control. But in practice, brain changes are nonlinear. Most often they are unconscious and deeply tied to emotion and new behaviour.\n\nOne common myth is that a single realisation or decision can ‘rewire’ you. In truth, even profound insights rarely result in lasting neural change unless reinforced by repetition and behaviour. Another is that you can eliminate trauma responses by replacing them. But trauma alters deep, limbic structures that don’t ‘recode’ easily. They adapt, yes, but only slowly and not always completely.\n\nThere’s also the misconception that anyone can change anything if they just try hard enough. But not all brains have the same capacity or conditions for change. There’s a dark side to the optimism around brain change. When the metaphor of rewiring is oversold, it can create false expectations. It oversimplifies. And in doing so, it runs the risk of making people feel broken when their transformation isn’t instant or complete.\n\nIf rewiring is easy, then why haven’t you fixed your depression? If brain change is automatic with the right programme, then why are you still struggling?\n\nThis thinking can be cruel. It ignores several factors – from the social to the environmental to the genetic – that shape and constrain neuroplasticity, many of which are only partially understood. It turns healing into a moral achievement, and failure into a personal flaw. Some therapy models and self-help programmes lean into this pressure, implying that full transformation is just a matter of effort. But science tells a different story: change is possible, yes. But it’s constrained by biology and shaped by context.\n\nI’ve seen patients blame themselves when neuroplasticity didn’t yield a cure. People grasp at therapies that promise to rewire away disease. The language of neuroscience is being used to justify everything from educational policy to digital detox programmes with little regard for the underlying data.\n\nNone of this is to say that neuroplasticity doesn’t exist. It does. Stroke recovery, phantom limb sensation, chronic pain syndromes and even language acquisition in adults all bear its fingerprints. What’s needed is precision. Scientists must be careful with their words. Clinicians must draw clearer boundaries between science and metaphor. And the public must be equipped to discern between poetic licence and peer-reviewed truth.\n\nWhat we really need is a more honest, but still hopeful, view of brain change.\n\nIf not ‘rewiring’, then what? Perhaps the better metaphor is not a machine being repaired but a landscape being reshaped. Neuroplasticity resembles erosion and regrowth: some paths deepen, others fade, and change unfolds unevenly over time.\n\nNeuroplasticity is a remarkable capacity. It offers real hope for recovery, adaptation and growth. But it requires patience, structure, repetition and support. It is not a quick fix. It is a lifelong process that demands sustained engagement.\n\nTo honour the brain’s ability to change, we need to respect how it actually works. That means moving beyond buzzwords and shortcuts, and toward a language that reflects both the promise and the limits of biology. The brain’s capacity for change is one of the most hopeful discoveries in modern science – but that change comes not through clever metaphors or overnight programmes. It comes through effort, repetition and time. By tempering our metaphors with reality, we can help people pursue transformation with both hope and humility. Language matters. ‘Rewiring the brain’ began as a hopeful metaphor. Let’s not let it become a misleading one.\n\nYour brain does not process information, retrieve knowledge or store memories. In short: your brain is not a computer\n\nA child’s brain can master anything from language to music. Can neuroscience extend that genius across the lifespan?\n\nAs tasks mount up, our brain’s ability to juggle goes down. Neuroergonomic tactics can relieve the cognitive burden\n\nNeuroscience gives us invaluable, wondrous knowledge about the brain – including an awareness of its limitations\n\nessayCognition and intelligence\n\nBrain-training games won’t boost your IQ, but a host of strategies can improve your cognitive abilities one piece at a time\n\nIt’s not just the planet and not just our health – the impact of a warming climate extends deep into our cortical fissures",

    "description": "A super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz, OpenAI, and other tech leaders has targeted New York Assembly member Alex Bores' congressional campaign, marking its first attack against a lawmaker supporting AI regulation.",
    "fullText": "A pro-AI super PAC backed by Andreessen Horowitz and OpenAI President Greg Brockman has chosen New York Assembly member Alex Bores — and his congressional bid — as its first target.\n\nThe PAC, dubbed Leading the Future, formed in August with a more than $100 million commitment to support policymakers with a light-touch — or a no-touch — approach to AI regulation. And that means going after policymakers who want to regulate AI. The super PAC has backing from a number of other prominent leaders in tech, including Palantir co-founder and 8VC managing partner Joe Lonsdale as well as AI search engine Perplexity.\n\n“I appreciate how straightforward they’re being about it,” Bores told a room of journalists Monday evening at a Journalism Workshop on AGI impacts and governance in Washington, D.C. “When they say, ‘Hey, we’re going to spend millions against Alex because he might regulate Big Tech and put basic guardrails on AI,’ I just basically forward that to my constituents.”\n\nBores, who’s running to represent the state’s 12th Congressional District, said AI anxieties are on the rise among his constituents, who worry about everything from data centers pushing up utility bills and worsening climate change to chatbots impacting kids’ mental health and automation transforming the job market.\n\nBores is the chief sponsor of New York’s bipartisan RAISE Act, which requires large AI labs to have a safety plan in place to prevent critical harms, follow their own safety plan, and disclose critical safety incidents, like bad actors stealing an AI model. The bill also prohibits AI firms from releasing models with unreasonable risks of critical harm and imposes civil penalties of up to $30 million if companies fail to live up to these standards. The legislation is currently awaiting Gov. Kathy Hochul’s signature.\n\nBores said while drafting and redrafting the bill, he consulted with the large AI firms like OpenAI and Anthropic. Those negotiations led to the removal of provisions like third-party safety audits, which he says the industry refused to accept. Nevertheless, the RAISE Act, and Bores himself, appears to have incurred the ire of Silicon Valley.\n\nZac Moffatt and Josh Vlasto, heads of Leading the Future, told Politico that they would work on a multibillion-dollar effort to sink Bores’ campaign.\n\nIn a statement sent to TechCrunch, they accused Bores of advancing “ideological and politically motivated legislation that would handcuff not only New York’s, but the entire country’s ability to lead on AI jobs and innovation.” The pair said “bills like the RAISE Act threaten American competitiveness, limit economic growth, leave users exposed to foreign influence and manipulation, and undermine our national security.”\n\n“The RAISE Act is a clear example of the patchwork, uninformed, and bureaucratic state laws that would slow American progress and open the door for China to win the global race for AI leadership,” Moffatt and Vlasto said in the emailed statement. “America needs one clear and consistent national regulatory framework for AI that strengthens our economy, creates jobs for American workers, supports vibrant communities, and protects users.”\n\nMany in Silicon Valley have pushed to prohibit states from passing regulation that relates to AI. Earlier this year, a provision blocking state AI laws was slipped into the federal budget bill and was later removed. Now, lawmakers like Sen. Ted Cruz are seeking to resurrect it through other legislative avenues.\n\nBores said he is concerned such a movement could continue to gain legs at a time when the federal government has passed no meaningful AI regulation. Where federal government moves slow, states are like startups — they can function as policy laboratories and move fast to test what works.\n\n“The question should be, has Congress solved the problem?” Bores said. “If Congress solves the problem, then it can tell the states to get out of the way, but if they’re not going to pass a bill that’s actually addressing any of the problems…and then [saying that states can’t do anything] that just doesn’t make sense to me.”\n\nBores also noted he has been in contact with policymakers in other states to work on standardizing legislation, which could combat Silicon Valley’s “patchwork” objection. He also believes that lawmakers should ensure there are no redundancies with the EU AI Act.\n\nBores emphasized that AI regulation isn’t meant to limit innovation, and that he has rejected bills that he thinks would have unintended consequences for the industry.\n\n“Having basic rules of the road, literal or metaphorical, is actually a very pro-innovation stance if done well,” Bores said. “I fundamentally believe that the AI that wins is going to be the AI that is trustworthy. And the pushback from industry to say that government has no role in establishing that trust is one that I think you’re seeing people reject at every level.”",

    "fullText": "A few months ago, we released our first agentic coding model, Composer 1. Since then, we've made significant improvements to the model’s coding ability.\n\nOur new release, Composer 1.5, strikes a strong balance between speed and intelligence for daily use. Composer 1.5 was built by scaling reinforcement learning 20x further on the same pretrained model. The compute used in our post-training of Composer 1.5 even surpasses the amount used to pretrain the base model.\n\nWe see continued improvements on coding ability as we scale. Measured by our internal benchmark of real-world coding problems, we find that the model quickly surpasses Composer 1 and continues to climb in performance. The improvements are most significant on challenging tasks.\n\nComposer 1.5 is a thinking model. In the process of responding to queries, the model generates thinking tokens to reason about the user’s codebase and plan next steps. We find that these thinking stages are critical to the model’s intelligence. At the same time, we wanted to keep Composer 1.5 fast and interactive for day-to-day use. To achieve a balance, the model is trained to respond quickly on easy problems with minimal thinking, while on hard problems it will think until it has found a satisfying answer.\n\nTo handle longer running tasks, Composer 1.5 has the ability to self-summarize. This allows the model to continue exploring for a solution even when it runs out of available context. We train self-summarization into Composer 1.5 as part of RL by asking it to produce a useful summary when context runs out in training. This may trigger several times recursively on hard examples. We find that self-summarization allows the model to maintain its original accuracy as context length varies.\n\nComposer 1.5 is a significantly stronger model than Composer 1 and we recommend it for interactive use. Its training demonstrates that RL for coding can be continually scaled with predictable intelligence improvements.\n\nLearn more about Composer 1.5 pricing here.",

    "description": "The discovery prompted an international search to figure out how the ancient headstone made it to New Orleans.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA nearly 2,000-year-old tombstone of a Roman sailor was discovered in the backyard of a New Orleans home.\n\nThe Latin inscription on the grave marker prompted a search for the origin story of the marble stone.\n\nThe buzz about the find in the local news led to the discovery of just how the ancient piece crossed the Atlantic Ocean.\n\nThis story is a collaboration with Biography.com.\n\nThe discovery of a nearly 2,000-year-old Roman sailor’s tombstone wasn’t so much an excavation as a backyard cleanup at a New Orleans home.\n\nWhen Daniella Santoro and her husband, Aaron Lorenz, started clearing away brush in the yard of their home, they uncovered a marble slab with what appeared to be a Latin inscription carved on it. In a strange turn of events, the slab turned out to be the grave marker of a Roman military sailor originally housed in an Italian museum. How it ended up 5,250 miles away is quite a journey.\n\nWhen Santoro, an anthropologist at Tulane University and the owner of the historic home on Cambronne Street in the Carrollton neighborhood in New Orleans, initially found the slab, she thought it could have been from one of the city’s historic cemeteries. She contacted D. Ryan Gray, professor of anthropology at the University of New Orleans.\n\n“I never feel like I’ve seen it all,” Gray wrote on the website of the Preservation Resource Center of New Orleans. “There are always surprises and new mysteries to solve.”\n\nThose new mysteries don’t often come with international intrigue that include World War II, garden decor, and the F.B.I.\n\nWith no cemeteries close by, Gray asked for help from a colleague at the University of Innsbruck and scholars at Tulane to decipher the Latin. They independently concluded that the stone featured a Roman funerary inscription for a sailor named Sextus Congenius Verus.\n\nThe second-century C.E. inscription read: “To the Spirits of the Dead for Sextus Congenius Verus, solider of the praetorian fleet Misenensis, from the tribe of the Bessi [of Thrace], (who) lived 42 years (and) served 22 in the military, on the trireme [warship] Asclepius. Atilius Carus and Vettius Longinus, his heirs, made (this) for him, well deserving.”\n\nMore shocking: this inscription was already known in the world of anthropology. “In fact, a stone fitting that exact description was missing from the city museum in Civitavecchia, Italy, near where it had originally been found,” Gray said. “This was a bit of a surprise, and it changed the scope of our inquiries.”\n\nAfter the backyard discovery and identification, the F.B.I.’s Art Crime Team got involved, picking up the one-foot-wide stone and keeping it in custody while the repatriation process kicked off to return the grave marker back to its original home.\n\nGetting the stone back to the Italian museum was one thing, but figuring out how it got to New Orleans was another.\n\nGray started investigating the owners of the home from the 20th century, when the house stayed in the same family for much of the 1900s. Thanks to the U.S. Census, Gray deduced that Frank Simon purchased the house for his family in 1909 while he was working at a wholesale shoe company. His daughters, working as seamstresses, later owned the home. But those facts provided no clues as to how a stone moved from Italy to Louisiana.\n\nWith that dead-end in place, Gray turned to the next-door neighbor, a U.S. Navy veteran who served in World War II. That, too, was a non-starter, showing he deployed in the Pacific and was never stationed in Italy.\n\nSusann Lusnia, associate professor of classical studies at Tulane, took the search to Italy, where she was already planning a summer research stint. She met with staff and curators at the city museum and learned the headstone’s original site, located northwest of Rome, was a major port for the Roman empire and remained a port into the 20th century. Allied bombing raids in 1943 and 1944 targeted the city in World War II, and the museum was destroyed and collections lost.\n\nLusnia discovered the marker was likely lost in the chaos after the war and confirmed the 34th division of the Fifth Army of the U.S. traveled through the town after liberating Rome, with units remaining in the area. At that point, Gray figured there had to be a connection between the soldiers of World War II and the slab, but he had no way of sifting through so many names.\n\nThat’s when crowdsourcing finished the job. As the local news picked up the story, a previous homeowner at the Cambronne Street site heard about the mysterious headstone and immediately made the connection, remembering placing the stone in the garden while planting a tree at her new house two decades ago.\n\n“I just thought it was a piece of art,” said Erin Scott O’Brien, according to Preservation in Print. “I had no idea it was a 2,000-year-old relic.”\n\nO’Brien’s grandfather, Charles Paddock Jr., served in the U.S. Army during World War II, stationed in Italy for a time. He returned to New Orleans in 1946 with his new wife, Adele, who he met in Italy. Charles taught at Loyola University and the tablet in question sat in a cabinet in his Baccich Street home. But with both grandparents passing in the 1980s, O’Brien didn’t know its significance. She ended up with what she thought was a decorative piece and added it to the backyard décor over two decades ago.\n\n“I was really thinking we’d have our list of possible people through whom it could have ended up here,” Gray said. “I didn’t really expect to actually find the actual person, so it’s pretty exciting to know how it ended up here.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "Back in May 2025, a widely followed analyst named KillaXBT posted a roadmap on X (formerly Twitter) about Bitcoin price that many traders scrolled past.\n\nThey are paying attention now. That specific BTC price prediction mapped out the cryptocurrency market structure almost perfectly, calling the top above $100,000 and the subsequent breakdown. But here is the catch: the model suggests the pain isn’t over yet.\n\nDISCOVER: Top 20 Crypto to Buy in 2026\n\nIt is rare to see a Bitcoin chart age this well. The prediction, which resurfaced recently, didn’t rely on hype or gut feelings. Instead, the analyst used something called “rotational market mathematics.”\n\nWhile that sounds intimidating, think of it simply as counting swings, like counting how many times a ball bounces before it loses energy and stops.\n\nDISCOVER: Best New Cryptocurrencies to Invest in 2026\n\nKillaXBT identified that Bitcoin’s “internal liquidity cycling” was exhausted at the highs. The chart correctly predicted that once the price fell below the $100,000 level, it wouldn’t just dip; it would enter a prolonged price crash.\n\nThis aligns with what we have seen recently, as Bitcoin broke major levels as a bearish structure tightened, validating the analyst’s foresight months later.\n\nThe resurfaced chart serves as a forward-looking map, and the destination is lower than most of us want to hear.\n\nKillaXBT’s technical analysis currently suggests that Bitcoin is stuck in a “distribution band” around $70,000. In plain English? Big players are likely selling into these small rallies rather than buying for the long haul.\n\nThe model’s final stage points to a capitulation event, a moment where investors quit in frustration, targeting the $50,000 area.\n\nThis mirrors other concerns in the market, where mounting pressure has led to warnings of a Bitcoin crash to $50k from various bearish analysts. The structure indicates that the bounces we are seeing are weak and corrective, lacking the true power needed to reverse the trend.\n\nWith market sentiment hitting extreme lows, often reflected when we see Crypto Fear and Greed at multi-year lows during a crash, the environment is ripe for this kind of final wash-out.\n\nKillaXBT notes that without a “macro base” forming (a solid floor where price stops dropping for a long time), the true bottom likely isn’t in yet.\n\nDISCOVER: Top Solana Meme Coins to Buy in 2026\n\nFollow 99Bitcoins on X For the Latest Market Updates and Subscribe on YouTube For Daily Expert Market Analysis\n\nRead original story This Analyst Nailed Bitcoin Price Top, Now He Is Calling The Bottom by Ahmed Balaha at 99bitcoins.com",

    "fullText": "MOSCOW, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Russia said on Monday the fuel situation in Cuba was critical and U.S. attempts to \"suffocate\" the island's economy were causing many difficulties, pledging to act ​against any sort of military intervention and expressing Moscow's solidarity with Cuba and Venezuela.\n\nCuba detailed ‌its plans to navigate the deepening crisis on Friday including protecting essential services and rationing fuel, as the communist-run government dug ‌in its heels in defiance of a U.S. effort to cut off oil supplies.\n\nThe administration of U.S. President Donald Trump has declared Cuba \"an unusual and extraordinary threat\" to U.S. national security and said it will no longer receive oil from Venezuela after the U.S. operation to capture its leader Nicolas Maduro last month. It has threatened ⁠to impose tariffs on other suppliers ‌like Mexico if they continue to ship fuel to the island.\n\n\"The situation in Cuba is indeed critical. We are aware of this. We are maintaining intensive contacts ‍with our Cuban friends through diplomatic and other channels,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nRussia is trying to restore its own battered ties with the United States as Trump seeks to broker a deal to end its war in ​Ukraine. But the Kremlin made clear it was unhappy with Washington's treatment of Cuba.\n\n\"The suffocating tactics ‌employed by the United States are indeed causing many difficulties for the country. We are discussing with our Cuban friends possible ways to resolve these problems, or at least to provide all possible assistance,\" said Peskov.\n\nPeskov was answering a question about jet fuel shortages and whether that might affect Russian tourists wanting to leave Cuba, a long-time ally of Moscow's.\n\nCuba warned international airlines that jet fuel would no longer ⁠be available on the island beginning on Tuesday. Air Canada ​said on Monday it was suspending flights to Cuba.\n\nRussian Foreign ​Minister Sergei Lavrov, in a message marking the day of diplomatic workers in Russia, said Moscow sought to build relations with developing countries.\n\n\"The focus remains on countering neo-colonial ‍practices, from unilateral coercive measures ⁠to military interventions,\" Lavrov wrote on his ministry's website.\n\n\"In this context, we reaffirm our solidarity with the people of Venezuela and Cuba.

    "title": "Singapore’s ST Engineering debuts the AirFish: A ‘ground effect’ craft that flies a few meters above the sea at up to 116 miles per hour",
    "description": "The AirFish isn’t quite a boat or a plane. Instead, it harnesses the ground effect to reduce drag as it flies from Singapore to Batam in just 25 minutes.",
    "fullText": "Singapore’s holiday-goers could soon be gliding over the sea, rather than cutting through them.\n\nAerospace firm ST Engineering debuted the AirFish, a 10-seater craft that glides around one to three meters above the water, on Feb. 3 at the Singapore Airshow.\n\n“For typical boats, there’s a lot of friction on the sea,” explains Leon Tan, vice president of ST Engineering AirX, the wing of the firm which oversees the craft’s design. The AirFish caters to travelers who “want point-to-point speed,” he tells Fortune, as it achieves a velocity of up to 100 knots (116 miles per hour), comparable to a light aircraft.\n\nWhat is ST Engineering's AirFish and how does it work?\n\nHow does the AirFish fit into ST Engineering's business strategy?\n\nWhat are ST Engineering's expansion plans for the AirFish?\n\nWhat partnerships has ST Engineering secured for the AirFish?\n\nThe AirFish harnesses the ground effect, which occurs when air becomes compressed between a wing and a surface, producing lift and reducing drag. This reduces how much energy the craft uses when it travels across the water’s surface, much like how an albatross glides for long distances with minimal energy. (The former Soviet Union was one of the largest proponents of ground-effect vehicles, which officials dubbed “ekranoplans,” and considered using as military vehicles.)\n\nST Engineering has already inked two partnerships for the AirFish, including one with ferry operator BatamFast to run trips between Singapore and the Indonesian town of Batam, with the first journeys starting in the third quarter of 2026. An AirFish can complete the journey in 25 minutes, half the time of a typical ferry.\n\nThe firm also announced on Feb. 3 that Indian operator Wings Over Water Ferries will also lease and operate up to four vessels in India by late 2026.\n\nTan, from ST Engineering, says the AirFish is part of the company’s shift toward making original equipment. Traditionally, it focuses on maintenance, repair, and overhaul (MRO); the company is the world’s largest airframe MRO provider, with facilities in Asia, Europe, and the U.S.\n\nWith 2024 revenue of $8.4 billion, ST Engineering is No. 33 on Fortune’s Southeast Asia 500 list, which measures the region’s largest companies by revenue. The company was founded in 1967 and stems from Singapore’s defense industry. Over the past 50 years, it’s broadened its portfolio to include aerospace and shipbuilding.\n\nST Engineering hopes to bring the AirFish to other destinations including Malaysia’s Tioman and Desaru, Tan tells Fortune. He believes that Southeast Asia’s maritime travel industry holds much potential for the AirFish, given that it has several archipelagic countries like Indonesia, which comprises over 17,000 islands, and the Philippines, which has over 7,000.\n\nThe company is also experimenting with building 24- and 36-seater AirFish crafts, which can transport more passengers on each flight, Tan says. It is also looking to build four-seater luxury AirFish crafts to cater to the ultrawealthy demographic.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

    "fullText": "“Often, the first tactic is to deny the claim and hope the consumer goes away.”\n\nThat statement came from Michael Brooks, executive director of the Center for Auto Safety, who had recently shed some light on how car manufacturers deal with warranty claims after a Pennsylvania couple had theirs wrongly denied.\n\nAs CBS News reports, Jamie and Debbie Rekasie’s 2019 Kia Optima came with a 100,000-mile powertrain warranty. But when the engine failed at 80,000 miles, the couple says the automaker insisted the car was not properly maintained and rejected their warranty claim (1). The Rekasies, on the other hand, believe their vehicle was properly maintained, and they have the receipts to prove it.\n\nDave Ramsey warns nearly 50% of Americans are making 1 big Social Security mistake — here’s what it is and 3 simple steps to fix it ASAP\n\nThanks to Jeff Bezos, you can now become a landlord for as little as $100 — and no, you don't have to deal with tenants or fix freezers. Here's how\n\nI’m approaching retirement with no savings. Should I panic? Here are 6 easy ways to catch up (and fast)\n\nThis story points to a worrying development, as many car owners likely don’t realize their warranty claims can be denied over things like insufficient documentation, or that consumer protection laws are on their side. Here’s what you need to know about your rights under federal warranty law and how you can challenge a denied warranty claim for your vehicle.\n\nAs they explained to CBS News, the Rekasies believe they did everything right when it comes to vehicle maintenance.\n\n“I have records,” said Jamie. “Fourteen oil changes, two sets of brakes, two sets of tires.”\n\nHowever, Kia reportedly still refused to pay for replacing the engine after the Rekasies provided the receipts. The couple’s son, who is a mechanic, performed the oil changes on the car, but Kia claims the receipts provided did not include the vehicle's VIN number or odometer reading, which led the automaker to deny the warranty claim on the basis of insufficient information.\n\nKia also stated the oil changes that the couple received went against its coverage policy; as the company shared with CBS News, Kia only approves home oil changes if the receipts list the vehicle mileage, the date, quantity of oil and an oil filter.\n\nThe Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act is a federal law designed to protect consumers for a variety of products, including vehicles (2).\n\nIt’s designed to ensure that manufacturers honor their warranties fairly and even stipulates that if a consumer sues a company for failing to uphold their warranty, the manufacturer will also have to pay the consumer’s legal fees if their case is successful (3).",

    "fullText": "The best friendships are the most unexpected ones, and this adorable moment between a tiny kitten and a donkey is enough to warm anyone's heart.\n\nIn a cute video posted to TikTok from Shriver Funny Farm, a donkey and a kitten bonded together in a sweet and tender moment. In the video, the donkey leaned down to sniff at the tiny kitten. Meanwhile, the kitten did its own investigation and sniffed the donkey as well, making it look like the pair were giving each other little nose bumps.\n\nThe cute moment had users absolutely obsessed with the \"wholesome\" moment between the most unlikely pair of friends.\n\n🐶\nA few users even compared them to Donkey and Puss in Boots from Shrek, with one user even commenting a photo of the characters.\n\nOther users loved the sweet moment, with another user writing, \"They’re going to be besties 🥰.\" Another added, \"Animals are so pure.\"\n\nOne other user mused that they \"wish I had a barn just to have barn cats\" that would befriend the other farm animals.\n\nUnlikely bonds and friendships between different animal species are more common than you may think, especially on a farm.\n\nAccording to BBC Earth, animals that especially live in close quarters together will \"turn to each other for entertainment if companions from their own species are thin on the ground.\"\n\nSo a friendship between a donkey and a kitten is not as far-fetched as it may seem at first glance.\n\nBut donkeys, especially, are known to be intelligent and sentient, with strong social bonds and a gentle nature, according to the World Animal Protection organization. Donkeys also have a sharp sense of smell, which helps them understand their surroundings and even bond with other animals.\n\nLike donkeys, cats, notorious for their curiosity, also use their sense of smell to understand their surroundings. PetCareRX reveals that a kitten's sense of smell fully develops at four weeks. As kittens, they will rely on smell and their other senses to understand the world around them until their sight is fully developed at five weeks.",

    "fullText": "Supporters of transgender rights gather at the Legislative Office Building in Concord last year, on Feb. 19, 2025. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)\n\nGov. Kelly Ayotte vetoed Senate Bill 268 Friday, a bill to allow transgender people to be excluded from restrooms, locker rooms, jails, and other spaces that don’t match their sex at birth.\n\n“I vetoed a nearly identical bill to this one last year,” Ayotte, a Republican, said in a statement announcing the veto. “I made it clear this issue needed to be addressed in a thoughtful, narrow way that protects the privacy, safety, and rights of all Granite Staters. Unfortunately, there is minimal difference between Senate Bill 268 and the bill I vetoed last year, which Governor Sununu vetoed the year prior.”\n\nLike 2025’s House Bill 148 and 2024’s House Bill 396, the Republican-backed SB 268 sought to create exceptions to the state’s antidiscrimination law, which was enacted in 2018 and protects people from discrimination on the basis of “gender identity” and other characteristics. In addition to allowing businesses and organizations to separate restrooms, locker rooms, and jails by sex at birth rather than self-expressed gender identity, the bills would’ve allowed schools to keep transgender girls off boys sports teams and vice versa.\n\nIn 2025, Ayotte endorsed some of the conservative lawmakers’ goals, but ultimately vetoed the legislation on the grounds that it was impractical.\n\n“I believe there are important and legitimate privacy and safety concerns raised by biological males using places such as female locker rooms and being placed in female correctional facilities,” Ayotte wrote at the time. “At the same time, I see that House Bill 148 is overly broad and impractical to enforce, potentially creating an exclusionary environment for some of our citizens.”\n\nIn December, conservatives failed to garner the votes necessary to override the governor’s veto.\n\nFormer Gov. Chris Sununu vetoed another similar bill in the final year of his tenure. Sununu, also a Republican, wrote in 2024 as he vetoed HB 396 that the bill “runs contrary to New Hampshire’s Live Free or Die spirit,” and “seeks to solve problems that have not presented themselves.” The Legislature also failed to overturn that veto.",

    "fullText": "Cathie Wood said she would favor Bitcoin over gold.\n\nPeter Schiff has fired back at Wood on X.\n\nWood reaffirmed ARK Invest’s long-term Bitcoin thesis.\n\nCathie Wood, chief executive of ARK Invest, said traders should consider shifting from gold into Bitcoin (BTC) — leading to a public pushback from famed gold advocate Peter Schiff.\n\nSpeaking on The Rundown podcast on Feb. 1, Wood argued that precious metals’ current price levels are difficult to justify outside periods of extreme economic stress.\n\n“If I were a betting person, I would make a shift from gold into Bitcoin,” Wood said.\n\nSpeaking on the podcast, Wood noted that gold has historically surged during periods such as the Great Depression and the high-inflation era of the 1970s and early 1980s.\n\nHowever, she emphasized that current conditions do not resemble either of those times.\n\n“Gold is probably ripe for a fall,” Wood said, pointing out that during the Great Depression, the U.S. government devalued the dollar against gold and confiscated private holdings.\n\nWhile she did not offer direct investment advice, Wood said she would personally favor Bitcoin over gold, citing its long-term role as a store of value.\n\nShe added that although stablecoins have assumed some of Bitcoin’s transactional role in emerging markets, she sees that as a temporary trend.\n\n“When people want real savings, they’re going to buy Bitcoin,” she said.\n\nThe comments drew a sharp response from long-time Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff on Sunday.\n\n“Cathie Wood is a fool,” Schiff wrote in a post on X.\n\nAdding: “Most people won’t realize that until they go broke following her advice.”\n\nIn a follow-up post, Schiff added: “You can’t say I’ve never been right. The most bullish Bitcoin promoters have now been wrong for years.”\n\nSchiff has consistently argued that gold remains a superior store of value compared with Bitcoin and other forms of crypto, warning that BTC’s price gains are driven largely by speculation.\n\nDespite the criticism, Wood has repeatedly defended her firm’s Bitcoin thesis and remained bullish on its long-term price growth.\n\nWood reiterated ARK Invest’s long-term bullish outlook for Bitcoin, pointing to the firm’s “bull case” price target of $1.5 million by 2030.\n\n“Digital gold contributes the most to our bear and base cases,” ARK wrote in its Big Ideas 2025 report. “Institutional investment drives our bull case.”\n\nDespite Wood claiming that stablecoins have taken up some of the role “we thought that Bitcoin would play,” she has remained strong on the firm’s long-term target.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON (AP) — The final two of nearly 30 civil lawsuits that Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson had faced from women accusing him of sexual misconduct have been dismissed, according to court records.\n\nThe dismissal of these two lawsuits clears Watson of legal problems he had been facing since 2021 after 27 women came forward and accused him in court filings in Texas of exposing himself, touching them with his genitals or kissing them against their will, mostly during massage appointments.\n\nSome of the women alleged Watson, 30, forced them to perform oral sex and one woman accused him of sexually assaulting her.\n\nThe dismissals come as both lawsuits had been set to go to trial in the next few weeks. The accusations against Watson were made when he played for the Houston Texans.\n\nIt is believed that Watson has no other lawsuits pending in connection with the sexual misconduct allegations.\n\nOne of the lawsuits that was dismissed on Friday has been settled, said Tony Buzbee, the attorney for the woman who had filed it. Buzbee declined to comment further, citing confidentiality of the settlement agreement. Buzbee's client alleged Watson touched her with his penis multiple times during a massage session.\n\nIt was not immediately known if the other dismissed lawsuit had also been settled. Anissah Nguyen, an attorney for the woman who filed the lawsuit, didn’t immediately respond to an email or call seeking comment. Nguyen's client had accused Watson of pressuring her to perform oral sex during a massage.\n\nWatson’s attorneys declined to comment.\n\nWatson, who was traded to the Browns in March 2022, has long denied any wrongdoing, and two separate Texas grand juries declined to indict him. One of his attorneys, Rusty Hardin, had previously said the allegations against Watson were “meritless.”\n\n“I don’t remember or recall any sexual encounters with her,” Watson said in a 2023 deposition he gave while being questioned about the woman represented by Nguyen.\n\nThe woman represented by Nguyen had also sued the Houston Texans, alleging Watson had assaulted women with the help and resources of the team. The lawsuit against the Texans was also dismissed last week.\n\nA spokesperson for the Texans didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment.\n\nIn July 2022, 30 women who had accused the Texans of turning a blind eye to allegations against their former star quarterback settled their legal claims against the team.\n\nIt was not unusual that all the cases against Watson were settled, said David Ring, a California-based attorney who is not connected to the lawsuits and who has represented victims of sexual assault. He said the majority of civil lawsuits are typically resolved before going to trial and that high-profile defendants typically don’t want cases to play out in a public courtroom.\n\n“He’s trying to put all of this behind him,” Ring said.\n\nWatson’s legal problems began after dozens of women claimed to have been the victims of sexual misconduct or assault between 2017 and 2020.\n\nMost of the lawsuits against Watson were settled in 2022.\n\nFollowing the allegations, Watson was suspended for the first 11 games in 2022 for violating the league’s personal conduct policy.\n\nWatson was also fined $5 million and underwent a mandatory evaluation before being reinstated by the league. He has played in only 19 games for the Browns due to the NFL suspension and injuries.\n\nFollow Juan A. Lozano: https://x.com/juanlozano70",

    "description": "\"I can never go back.\"",
    "fullText": "Scientists are warning that Himalayan glacial lakes are becoming a growing threat to communities downstream as \"too little snow and too much rain\" destabilize the region's terrain.\n\nThulagi Glacial Lake, at the base of the retreating Thulagi Glacier near Mount Manaslu in Nepal, has expanded over the past few decades as surrounding ice melted, the Nepali Times reported.\n\nOnce a small pool in the 1960s, the lake is now more than 1 square kilometer (nearly 250 acres) and holds close to 10 billion gallons of water.\n\nScientists have classified Thulagi as one of the most dangerous glacial lakes in the Himalayas, among 47 others on an ICIMOD watchlist. They fear a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF), a sudden release of water triggered by landslides, ice collapse, or weakening natural dams.\n\n\"The lake will burst sooner or later,\" local guide Chandra Bahadur Gurung told the Nepali Times.\n\nA 2018 study followed the evolution of three glacial lakes, including Thulagi, finding that a GLOF from Thulagi posed a risk to communities and four hydropower projects downstream.\n\nRising global temperatures — driven by the production and use of oil, gas, and coal — are raising the risks of melting and devastating GLOFs.\n\nModeling showed that if Thulagi were to burst, floodwaters could reach downstream towns within hours, with surges over 40 feet in some locations. Entire villages could be wiped out, roads and bridges destroyed, and rivers permanently rerouted.\n\nResidents in Nepal's Manang district still carry trauma from flooding in 2021, when heavy rainfall led to surging water in the Marsyangdi River.\n\n\"I did not know if I would live or die,\" one hotel owner recalled after watching water tear through his village.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\n\"The Marsyangdi flows through my house now,\" said Kamarkali Gurung. \"I can never go back.\"\n\nExtreme weather events like these destroy and disrupt livelihoods, tourism, agriculture, and energy production for vulnerable communities.\n\nExtreme rainfall in the region has already devastated farms in Nepal and doubled food prices for families, and past GLOFs have washed away homes and healthcare clinics and taken lives.\n\nBeyond immediate destruction, flooding can contaminate drinking water, spread disease, and destabilize ecosystems that communities depend on for fishing and farming.\n\nIt wasn't until the 2021 floods that early warning systems were installed on the banks of the Marsyangdi River and nearby towns.\n\nHowever, there is currently little preparation beyond that, and no warning systems cover Thulagi.\n\nLast year, the Green Climate Fund approved a $36.1 million grant to help reduce the risk of GLOFs by reducing water levels in four glacial lakes, including Thulagi, under the United Nations Development Program.\n\nGlobally, scientists stress that protecting vulnerable communities requires coordinated multinational efforts to slow ice loss, invest in resilient infrastructure, transition to clean energy, and plan relocations only when necessary.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) — Venezuela's top prosecutor said on Monday that his office had requested the arrest of one of the closest allies of opposition leader María Corina Machado, less than 12 hours after his release from a detention facility as part of a government move to free those facing politically motivated accusations.\n\nThe attorney general’s statement did not say whether Juan Pablo Guanipa was rearrested, or give indication of his whereabouts. The government had released him along with several other prominent opposition members on Sunday following lengthy politically motivated detentions.\n\nAttorney General Tarek William Saab's office posted on social media that it had “requested the competent court to revoke the precautionary measure granted to Juan Pablo Guanipa, due to his non-compliance with the conditions imposed by the aforementioned court.”\n\nIt did not elaborate on what conditions Guanipa, a former governor for the opposition, violated during the hours he was free, but said authorities were seeking house arrest.\n\nGuanipa's son, Ramón, told reporters Monday that a group of men in three vehicles intercepted his father and others traveling around 11:45 p.m. Sunday in a neighborhood in the capital, Caracas. They were armed with long guns and wore civilian clothes and bulletproof vests.\n\nRamón Guanipa said authorities have not yet notified him of his father's whereabouts and their decision to place him on house arrest. He said his father did not violate the two conditions of his release — monthly check-ins with a court and no travel outside Venezuela — and showed reporters the court document listing them.\n\nThe development marked the latest twist in the political turmoil in Venezuela in the wake of the U.S. military's seizure on Jan. 3 of then-President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, from a military base compound in Caracas in a stunning operation that landed them in New York to face federal drug trafficking charges.\n\nThe government of Venezuela's acting President Delcy Rodríguez began releasing prisoners days after she was sworn in and has faced mounting pressure to free hundreds of people whose detentions months or years ago have been linked to their political activities. The releases also followed a visit to Venezuela of representatives of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nVenezuelan-based prisoners’ rights group Foro Penal confirmed the release of at least 30 people Sunday.\n\nSome of those freed Sunday joined families waiting outside detention facilities for their loved ones. They chanted “We are not afraid! We are not afraid!” and marched a short distance.\n\n“I am convinced that our country has completely changed,” Guanipa told reporters after his release. “I am convinced that it is now up to all of us to focus on building a free and democratic country.”\n\nGuanipa had spent more than eight months in custody at a facility in Caracas.\n\n“My father cannot be a criminal ... simply for making statements,” Ramón Guanipa said. \"How much longer will speaking out be a crime in this country?”\n\nSeveral members of Machado’s political organization were among the released Sunday, including attorney Perkins Rocha and local organizer María Oropeza, who had in 2024 livestreamed her arrest by military intelligence officers as they broke into her home with a crowbar. Rocha was released to house arrest.\n\n“They are terrified that Venezuelan society will mobilize and express its voice civically,” Machado, referring to Rodríguez's government, told reporters Monday in Washington. “But let me tell you something, there’s no going back... What will Juan Pablo become now? What will Perkins become as a prisoner in his own home? A reference in this fight.”\n\nLong detentions for political activities\n\nGuanipa was detained in late May and accused by Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello of participating in an alleged “terrorist group” that was plotting to boycott that month’s legislative election. Guanipa’s brother Tomás rejected the accusation, and said the arrest was meant to crack down on dissent.\n\nRodríguez’s government announced Jan. 8 that it would free a significant number of those arrested — a central demand of the country’s opposition and human rights organizations with backing from the United States — but families and rights watchdogs have criticized authorities for the slow pace of the releases.\n\nThe ruling party-controlled National Assembly last week began debating an amnesty bill that could lead to the release of hundreds. The opposition and nongovernmental organizations have reacted with cautious optimism as well as with suggestions and demands \n\nNational Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez, who is the acting president's brother, on Friday posted a video on Instagram showing him outside a detention center in Caracas and saying that “everyone” would be released no later than next week, once the amnesty bill is approved.\n\nDelcy Rodríguez, the acting president, and Volker Türk, the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, spoke by phone in late January. His spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, in a statement said he sent a team to the country and “offered our support to help Venezuela work on a road map for dialogue and reconciliation\" in which human rights should be centered.\n\nThis story is part of an ongoing collaboration between The Associated Press and FRONTLINE (PBS) that includes an upcoming documentary.",

    "fullText": "GRAND JUNCTION Colo. (KREX)- A 41-year-old Grand Junction man suffered life-threatening injuries early Sunday when his vehicle rolled after striking a horse on Interstate 70 near Fruita, authorities said.\n\nThe crash happened around 1:37 a.m. in the eastbound lanes of I-70 at mile marker 22, according to the Colorado State Patrol. Troopers said a horse entered the roadway and was struck by multiple vehicles.\n\nThe man, driving a Toyota Land Cruiser, was the first to hit the horse. His vehicle rolled and came to rest on its roof, trapping him inside, state patrol officials said. He was taken to a nearby hospital with life-threatening injuries.\n\n“After impact, the Land Cruiser ended up rolling, coming to rest on its roof,” a Colorado State Patrol Trooper Gabriel Moltrer said. “That driver was transported to an area hospital for life-threatening injuries.”\n\nThe driver has been identified through a GoFundMe as Kyle Freud out of Grand Junction, who friends describe as a husband, father and longtime member of the Land Cruiser and off-road community.\n\nA second vehicle, a Ford F-250 driven by a 17-year-old male from Peyton, also struck the horse. That driver was not injured, authorities said. The horse died at the scene.\n\nEastbound lanes of I-70 were closed for several hours while crews worked to remove the vehicles and clear the roadway. The Colorado Department of Transportation assisted with the cleanup, and the highway reopened shortly before 5 a.m.\n\nOfficials urge drivers to use caution on rural highways, especially during overnight and early morning hours when animals are more active.\n\n“When you see an animal in the roadway, brake firmly. Don’t swerve,” said Chuck Marsh, regional communications manager for CDOT. “The last thing you want to do is end up in oncoming traffic or off the road.”\n\nState patrol officials have not confirmed where the horse came from. The crash remains under investigation.",

    "description": "What happened between them?",
    "fullText": "President Trump is notorious for his emotional ups and downs and for turning on people on a dime. So, it’s not surprising that someone like Jeff Bezos would be trying hard to stay in the President’s good graces. This entire presidency, we’ve seen business leaders from all sides of the political aisle try to integrate themselves with Trump, because that’s beneficial for their business. Business first, morals later. Or something.\n\nNow, there are reports that the recent layoffs at the Washington Post, which Bezos owns, might have had something to do with Trump. Martin Baron, former executive editor of the Post, told Jen Psaki on “The Briefing” that the layoffs were related to Trump.\n\nBad Bunny's Real Feelings About Trump Resurface as the President Calls His Super Bowl Performance 'Disgusting' & the 'Worst Ever'\n\nGreen Day Just Called Out Trump After the President Refused to Attend the Super Bowl & Called Them a 'Terrible Choice'\n\nAccording to Barron, when he joined the Washington Post in 2013, “It was a great news organization then,” even if “it had faced many challenges.\n\n“[Bezos] acquired the paper about a year after I had been there. He invested. He spoke on behalf of the mission of the Post. He spoke on behalf of the mission of the press in this country,” he said, adding that the paper “grew under the ownership” of Bezos.\n\nBut he was clear that the layoffs “represent a turn back.”\n\n“It suggests that this newspaper, with a deep heritage and historically high ambitions, is going to retreat,” he explained. “And it’s a terrible thing to see a news organization that’s been so important to the history of this country retreat the way that this newspaper is doing.”\n\nAll of this, Baron said, can be traced back to Trump. “I explain it by saying the words ‘Donald Trump.’ That’s what happened.”\n\n“Trump came into office again,” Baron said. “He had promised vengeance against his perceived political enemies. Jeff Bezos was seen as a political enemy by Donald Trump for one reason and one reason only, and that was the coverage of the Washington Post.”\n\nAnd that coverage was, of course, not always positive. Baron was clear that he believed Bezos feared repercussions for him and his business due to the Washington Post’s reporting.\n\nWhen Trump returned to the White House, Baron said he believed Bezos was afraid the administration would target him and his other businesses for the Post’s journalism. “And so he has sought to navigate this administration during the second term,” Baron explained. And that apparently means scaling back the negative coverage of Trump and moving more towards the center, something Baron was very critical of. This is also something that has been pointed out by many others as over 300 journalists were fired from the Washington Post in recent days, with the entirety of the books and sports section and most of its international coverage being shut down.\n\n“This is a newspaper that has prided itself on its independence, and the behavior of Jeff Bezos has suggested to the readers that he is not independent at all,” Baron said. “He’s actually dependent — dependent on Donald Trump.”\n\nNot a good sign for one of the most important newspapers in the country, one whose logline is: Democracy Dies in Darkness.\n\nThe 26 Best Romantic Comedies to Watch if You Want to Know What Love Feels Like\n\nThese ‘Bachelor’ Secrets & Rules Prove What Happens Behind the Scenes Is So Much Juicier\n\nBTS's 7 Members Were Discovered in the Most Unconventional Ways",

    "description": "\"Well, initially, my reaction to all this was, ‘I don't care. I don't know what the big deal is.’ But now I see what the big deal is\"",
    "fullText": "Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) told Congressional reporter Pablo Manríquez on Monday that she now supports the full release of the Epstein files after expressing shock at the inclusion of a potentially nine-year-old victim in the latest document dump.\n\n“I’ve not been one of the members who has glommed on to this as an issue. I’ve sort of intentionally deferred to others to find out about it. But nine-year-old victims—” Lummis told Manríquez, expressing shock and horror at the revelation.\n\nManríquez jumped in and added, “All over the world—Moscow is saying it was sort of like a real global network that they’re now getting to see on these four terminals they have.” The terminals refer to the Department of Justice computers that members of Congress are being allowed to view the unredacted Epstein files on.\n\n“Wow. Well, initially, my reaction to all this was, ‘I don’t care. I don’t know what the big deal is.’ But now I see what the big deal is, and it was worth investigating. And the members of Congress that have been pushing this were not wrong. So that’s really my only reaction,” Lummis added.\n\nLummis’s remarks are a notable break from President Donald Trump’s position on the Epstein files and the House Republicans who pushed for their release, including Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) – who Trump has vowed to run out of office. “It’s all been a big hoax, it’s perpetrated by the Democrats,” Trump said last year about the effort to release the files. “And some stupid Republicans and foolish Republicans fall into the net. And so they try and do the Democrats’ work. The Democrats are good for nothing other than these hoaxes.”\n\nLummis announced late last year that she will not seek reelection and is leaving politics when her term ends in January 2027.\n\nReporter is @PabloReports https://t.co/OMxvXzQMvs\n\n— Pablo Manríquez (@PabloReports) February 9, 2026\n\nThe post GOP Senator Changes Tune On Epstein Files Release: ‘Now I See What the Big Deal Is’ first appeared on Mediaite.",

    "description": "Smartwool combined the natural temperature-regulating, moisture-wicking, and odor-resisting properties of wool with an innovative Core Spun knitting technique to create Merino 150 Boxer Briefs — a durable and comfortable pair of underwear that can be worn year-round.",
    "fullText": "\"The very first time I put on a pair of Tommy John Boxer Briefs, I couldn't help but notice they were substantially longer than other boxers. It was a bit weird visually and it took a few minutes to get used to having material that far down my leg, but I came to appreciate the length almost immediately,\" says men's style editor Amir Ismael. \n\nThe Second Skin boxer briefs are as light as air and exceptionally comfortable yet supportive. It's details like horizontal \"Quick Draw\" fly, front contour pouch, and won't-budge waistband that also make them a clear winner. They make boxer briefs with both stretchy, no-pill Modal fabric as well as a cooling pima cotton, with our favorite being the just-short-of-mid-thigh 8-inch cut.\n\nRead our full Tommy John review for further insight into what makes these our absolute favorite brand for men's underwear.\n\nBombas makes some of the best boxer briefs (and of course, socks) with a second mission in mind – for every pair purchased, they donate special Bombas underwear to homeless shelters. And the quality really stacks up, especially with the brand's soft, stretchy, dependable cotton Modal underwear. It holds its shape over time and feels lighter than traditional cotton.\n\n\"The material itself feels soft against skin, but other design elements like minimal seams, no tags, and a wide waistband also add to the comfort. I like my underwear to have a fly and Bombas' diagonal fly is unlike any other design I've seen; it provides easy access and gets the job done,\" says Amir.\n\nRead more about what TIME once called a best style invention in our full Bombas underwear review.\n\nFor a company that hung its hat on its underwear and T-shirts, Mack Weldon now makes daily office wear, from chinos to dress shirts.  And while their quality workwear is impressive, we must talk about what goes underneath. Mack Weldon's best boxer briefs use their trademark AIRKNITx fabric, a special weave and fiber that provides next-level breathability and air flow.\n\n\"I wear them during shorter jogs, during travel, and pretty much any time I want to keep things in place, as it were, when on the go (intense workouts or multi-mile runs aside),\" writes freelance author Steven John.\n\nThere's a wide range of colors to suit every preference, but it's the performance details like the \"targeted cool zones\" that make a difference.\n\nSee our full Mack Weldon review, where we found that they withstand years of wear and washing.\n\nIf you aim to dress for an active lifestyle on all fronts, you're very likely going to love Saxx. Saxx dials in all the details, starting with a range of eye-catching colors and prints that inspire confidence – but it's about more than just looks. Compression, comfort and performance are paramount, as Saxx boxer briefs have an exceptionally supportive trademark design.\n\n\"The cleverly named 'BallPark Pouch' is the most notable design element of a pair of Saxx underwear. The simple, yet innovative technology consists of two little flaps of fabric that keep a man's legs and his business separated,\" writes former senior reporter Owen Burke. \"'The Pouch' also helps prevent the buildup of moisture down there, reducing irritation, odor, and general annoyance.\"\n\nThe Vibe's materials reduce chafing and wicks away moisture for ventilated security, great for if you prefer a close fit or need underwear specifically for exercising. They're also built with a shorter, streamlined 5-inch inseam that moves easily beneath slim trousers and even athletic shorts.\n\nRead more about what six guys felt about their men's underwear in our full Saxx review.\n\nAt $12 a pair, Jockey's boxer briefs beat out other comparable pairs in terms of price. But beyond that, you'll find multiple reasons to score some new pairs from this long-running brand. There's the company's deep experience with making men's basics, of course. But they're going even more modern these days, using soft stretch organic cotton, keyhole fly, and a 6.5-inch inseam for a  streamlined, close-fitting design that works well with slimmer trousers and shorts. There are also design details like a tag-free back and stay-put legs that won't ride up.\n\nMeUndies might not have been one of the first clothing subscription services for basics, but they're certainly one of the best. The company uses super-soft, comfortable MicroModal (a more eco-friendly alternative to rayon) to build its boxer briefs, of which you can customize inseam, fly closure, or inclusion of their signature \"Ball Caddy Pouch\". Special-edition designs, colors, prints and patterns dot the MeUndies Web site. These pairs are also size and gender-inclusive to suit everybody.\n\nYou can build your own bundle and mix and match to your heart's content, or choose a surprise bundle. Another convenient option is signing up for MeUndies' monthly rolling subscription service.\n\nRead more about the perks of their bundles in our full MeUndies review.\n\nBoxer briefs are widely thought of as the most practical everyday underwear choice for men. Since boxer briefs more closely hug the skin, they work equally well with slim-fit or slim-straight pants, from blue jeans to corduroys. Boxer briefs are also a wise choice with suit pants, since more formal trousers follow the line of your leg.\n\nEven though boxer briefs hug the thigh, they should feel like an effortless protective layer for daily activities like commuting or lounging, while also providing enough ventilation to keep you cool and comfortable during nights out. Moisture-wicking, compression pairs are best suited for active pursuits like moderate hiking or outdoor exercise. \n\nMost boxer briefs feature an inseam between 6 and 8 inches, which should hit mid-thigh for a stay-put fit. You'll find that boxer briefs forgo the typical button fly of the best boxers for men, and some are designed with no fly or even a horizontal fly, like Tommy John's. The best boxer briefs are also defined by a secure fit – look for a waistband that's made from smooth elastic, one that's wide enough to not roll over or bunch up.",

    "fullText": "Lindsey Vonn, 41, says she has \"no regrets\" about her Olympics comeback despite her crash during the women's alpine downhill competition on Sunday.\n\nThe US alpine skier was about 13 seconds into her downhill run when she clipped a gate with her arm, lost control, and tumbled down the slope before landing on her back. She was then airlifted off the course and later underwent surgery at a local hospital.\n\nVonn's fall at the Olympics on Sunday came just over a week after she tore her ACL in a crash at the Alpine Ski World Cup.\n\nIn a statement posted to her Instagram page on Monday, Vonn said her Olympic dreams did not end in the way she thought they would. \n\n\"I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever,\" Vonn wrote in the caption of her post, which was accompanied by a photo taken moments before she lost control during Sunday's race.\n\nA post shared by L I N D S E Y • V O N N (@lindseyvonn)\n\n\"Unfortunately, I sustained a complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly,\" she said.\n\nThe opportunity to compete at the Olympics and knowing she had \"a chance to win was a victory in and of itself,\" she added.\n\n\"While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets. Standing in the starting gate yesterday was an incredible feeling that I will never forget,\" Vonn wrote.\n\nThe athlete also said she was aware of all the risks involved in he sport.\n\n\"And similar to ski racing, we take risks in life. We dream. We love. We jump. And sometimes we fall. Sometimes our hearts are broken. Sometimes we don't achieve the dreams we know we could have. But that is the also the beauty of life; we can try,\" Vonn wrote.\n\nVonn is a three-time Olympic medalist who made her debut at the 2002 Salt Lake City Games. The Milan Cortina Games is her fifth Olympics.\n\nShe initially announced that she was retiring from the sport in 2019.\n\n\"My body is broken beyond repair and it isn't letting me have the final season I dreamed of. My body is screaming at me to STOP and it's time for me to listen,\" Vonn wrote in a post on Instagram.\n\nHowever, just months after undergoing a right-knee replacement surgery, Vonn told The New York Times in 2024 that she was planning to train with the US ski team again.\n\nIn the wake of her latest injury from Sunday's crash, Vonn's comeback has prompted concern from those closest to her, including her father.\n\n\"She's 41 years old and this is the end of her career,\" her father Alan Kildow told the AP on Monday. \"There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.\"\n\nDespite that, Kildow, who is a former ski racer himself, said his daughter is holding up emotionally.\n\n\"She's a very strong individual,\" Kildow said. \"She knows physical pain and she understands the circumstances that she finds herself in. And she's able to handle it. Better than I expected. She's a very, very strong person. And so I think she's handling it real well.\"\n\nHe added that she won't be returning to the Olympics, even to cheer on her teammates: \"She will be going home at an appropriate point in time.\"",

    "fullText": "Vibe coding everything is just not worth it, says an Andressen Horowitz partner.\n\nOn an episode of the \"20VC\" podcast released on Monday, A16z general partner Anish Acharya said that companies shouldn't use AI-assisted coding for every part of their business.\n\nHe said that software accounts for 8% to 12% of a company's expenses, so using vibe coding to build the company's resource planning or payroll tools would only save about 10%. Relying on AI to write code also carries risks, he said.\n\n\"You have this innovation bazooka with these models. Why would you point it at rebuilding payroll or ERP or CRM,\" Acharya said, referring to enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management software. Salesforce, Microsoft, Oracle, and SAP are among the top providers of such software.\n\nInstead, companies are better off using AI to develop their core businesses or optimize the remaining 90% of their costs, said the venture capitalist of six years.\n\n\"Of course, there will be secular losers. There are specific business models that are now going to be disadvantaged,\" he said. \"But the general story that we're going to vibe code everything is flat wrong, and the whole market is oversold software.\"\n\nAcharya's comments follow a brutal week for software stocks, which dragged down tech and broader markets. The sell-off started when already-wary investors panicked about Anthropic's new AI tool, which can perform a range of clerical tasks for people working in the legal industry.\n\nThe A16z partner joins famed investor Vinod Khosla in saying that stock prices should be ignored when evaluating the future of tech companies.\n\nOn a podcast last month, Khosla dismissed talks of an AI bubble and said investors should not be concerned as long as API call volume, a benchmark of AI usage, remains high.\n\n\"If that's your fundamental metric of what's the real use of your AI, usefulness of AI, demand for AI, you're not going to see a bubble in API calls,\" he said. \"What Wall Street tends to do with it, I don't really care.

    "description": "Sr. Lt. Serhii Andrieiev told Business Insider that the cold can disrupt anything from the drone's camera lens, to its battery, to its aerodynamics.",
    "fullText": "Extreme winter temperatures can pose an onslaught of technical challenges for drone operators on Ukraine's front lines, a local drone commander said as his country was hit by a cold snap.\n\nSr. Lt. Serhii Andrieiev, deputy commander of the \"Kraken\" drone company in the 3rd Army Corps, told Business Insider that the cold can heavily disrupt reconnaissance and first-person-view attack drones because their parts often aren't designed to withstand such conditions.\n\n\"Their behavior is unpredictable, how they will operate in the frost. It's a bit, kind of like Russian roulette,\" Andrieiev said. \"Will it work, or will it fall on the field?\"\n\nMany drones in Ukraine are built with off-the-shelf components ordered online. The freewheeling nature of the supply market means it's difficult to assess how consistently each individual part performs in the cold, Andrieiev said.\n\n\"These components are serially manufactured components. They are not mil-spec components. They are cheap, and well, most of them are from China,\" he said.\n\nHe said Ukrainian units have learned to adapt, but these issues can delay critical missions or add to mental strain for troops already dealing with harsh weather. Such challenges also imply risks for other militaries seeking to bolster their drone forces, especially as concerns grow that potential new wars may spill into the Arctic regions.\n\nAndrieiev was speaking as Ukraine had just experienced one of its coldest weeks since the full-scale war began. Average temperatures in the first week of February dropped to about -19°C, or -2.2°F.\n\nIn Kharkiv, where Andrieiev's troops are fighting, some nights registered temperatures as low as -6°F.\n\nAlmost every part of the drone is susceptible to such cold. For example, Andrieiev said, low temperatures can significantly reduce the voltage of its battery, causing it to die more quickly when used at full capacity.\n\n\"You can't predict the behavior of this battery. To switch on the drone, no problem. The problem starts when it flies and hits the maximum power of its battery,\" Andrieiev said.\n\nA bigger issue arises because the drone generates heat as it flies. When it's cold out, the temperature gap between the aircraft's internal structure and the environment puts stress on its electronics and motors.\n\nThe drone can also get wet through condensation, disrupting its wiring or fogging up its lenses. Even aerodynamics can be affected when frost and small icicles grow on the chassis or propellers.\n\nThe result can be frustrating for the drone pilot, Andrieiev said. Sometimes, they watch helplessly as their drone, still transmitting footage to their screen, crashes to the ground or into a tree because a component fails.\n\n\"You identify your target, you should hit the target. You prepare your drone, drone is starting, drone flying to target, and just in the middle of the flight, it falls to the ground. And that's it,\" he said.\n\nWhen his units receive drones that aren't working well in the cold, they typically return the entire batch to the manufacturer and request improvements.\n\nWhile Andrieiev said that quality issues are becoming \"much less of a problem\" for Ukrainian drone manufacturers, returning drones costs valuable time.\n\n\"It takes time, and you should have a buffer stock of those components and drones, so that you can replace it faster than the manufacturer,\" he said.\n\nOther equipment for attack drones, such as antennae, transmitters, or supporting relay drones that extend signals, can also fail. Hair-thin fiber-optic cables used to circumvent Russian jamming need to be high-quality to avoid damage from the frost as well, he added.\n\n\"The FPV drone is just one link, one element of this whole system,\" Andrieiev said.",

    "description": "To Andre Neveling, the hippy vibe in Bali feels less like a genuine search for peace and more like an overdone tourist trend.",
    "fullText": "My obsession with travel began early. While other kids plastered their walls with posters of pop stars, I pinned up a world map.\n\nGrowing up in South Africa, international travel felt like a distant dream. But everything changed in my early 20s. After saving up from my first job, I finally took my first trip abroad. It was a chilly journey to London to see the Spice Girls reunite — one of my childhood dreams.\n\nThat trip ignited a passion in me that's never faded.\n\nSince then, I've seized every opportunity to explore, whether for work or leisure. And while many destinations have lived up to their hype, some have left me wishing I'd kept those dreams in my imagination.\n\nHaving traveled to 40 countries and counting, I've learned that some places, no matter how iconic, are better left as daydreams. These are five destinations that left me disappointed.\n\nBack in 2010, a three-day layover in Cairo on an EgyptAir flight from London to Johannesburg felt like destiny calling. I'd always been mesmerized by ancient Egypt's pharaohs, myths, and architecture. Stepping off the plane, however, the Egypt of my imagination vanished almost instantly.\n\nIn its place was a sprawling, brown city of intense heat, dilapidation, and overwhelming frenzy. From the moment I left the airport, I felt like a walking target. Every interaction, from a forced perfume-shop detour to navigating the aggressive markets, felt like a potential scam.\n\nAnd then, there they were. The Pyramids of Giza. They are, undeniably, breathtaking. More massive, more majestic, more impossible than any picture could capture. Standing before them, I felt a genuine awe I will never forget. But the magic was short-lived.\n\nTurning around, the view was dominated by fast-food joints directly across from the Sphinx. The air was thick not with ancient mystery, but with the shouts of hundreds of vendors and the exhaust of countless tour buses. Even the famous Nile River turned out to be a polluted dump, with a stench so foul that Baby Moses would rot in his little basket.\n\nParis has always been the epitome of romance and beauty — at least in my mind. Since my university days, when I studied French, I'd dreamed of walking along the Seine, gazing up at the Eiffel Tower, and experiencing the city of love firsthand. It was my top European destination, and I imagined it would be a fairy tale. Reality hit hard.\n\nParis has a certain grittiness about it. I never felt the same sense of safety I've felt in other major European capitals. And while Parisian rudeness is legendary, experiencing it firsthand was still a shock. How a city's people could be so blatantly ill-mannered toward foreign tourists blew my mind.\n\nOf course, there's the Eiffel Tower, which is indeed majestic from a distance. But up close, you're met with never-ending lines, security checks, and crowds. Venturing to the top unlocked a vertigo I never knew I possessed — the iconic view was barely a consolation for my white-knuckled grip on the railing.\n\nIf travel was my first love, showbiz was my second. Like millions, I grew up on a diet of American movies and TV that painted Hollywood as a glittering, otherworldly paradise of palm trees and perpetual glamour. To walk the Hollywood Walk of Fame was the ultimate dream.\n\nBut Hollywood isn't all glitz and glamour. The reality was a stark contrast to the movies I'd loved. The opulence is there, but so is poverty, grime, and a suffocating mass of tourists. My heart sank to see homeless people on the stars I'd dreamed of exploring.\n\nAnd the iconic Hollywood sign, while undeniably cool to spot in the hills, is almost impossible to photograph. Despite trying numerous times over the years, my last attempt in 2019 ended with me once again lost in the hills, with zero phone signal, dehydrated, and surrounded by rattlesnakes.\n\nBali is sold as the \"Eat, Pray, Love\" island paradise for spiritual awakening and rustic, tropical bliss. But what I found felt more like a well-branded spiritual-industrial complex.\n\nThe reality is an island straining under mass tourism: notorious traffic clogging tiny roads, drunk and rowdy Australians, and hordes of inexperienced tourists wobbling on scooters.\n\nWorst of all, for me, is the performative \"enlightenment.\" The hippy vibe feels less like a genuine search for peace and more like an overdone tourist trend.\n\nDuring a visit last year, I attended a meditation session where the man next to me, bare-chested with long flowing hair, turned over and introduced himself as Tarzan. I couldn't help roll my eyes. In that moment, he encapsulated my Bali experience: A beautiful island where authenticity often feels sacrificed by an almost cultlike, spiritual aesthetic.\n\nTo criticize any part of Thailand feels like a betrayal. In fact, I adore the country so much that I moved there last year. Over the years, I've explored the alleys of Bangkok and island-hopped between the country's stunning southern islands like Phuket and Koh Samui. So naturally, the cultured, serene north of Chiang Mai was next on my list.\n\nHowever, I was left completely underwhelmed when I finally visited in 2023. Chiang Mai is undeniably pleasant. It's serene. It's famous for its stunning temples. But after you've visited the fifth or sixth wat, you quickly realize there isn't much else to do.\n\nMy memory is of a dusty, charming town, one sleepy river, and a bunch of temples. In a kingdom bursting with energetic cities and idyllic islands, Chiang Mai is Thailand's sleepiest, if not downright dull, destination.",

Last month, the agency's CEO and founder, Casey Wasserman, appeared in a trove of Department of Justice documents related to child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n\"I hold my teams to the highest standards and have a duty to protect them as well,\" Roan wrote. \"No artist, agent, or employee should ever be expected to defend or overlook actions that conflict so deeply with our own moral values.\"\n\nThe \"Good Luck, Babe!\" singer said she respected and appreciated staff at the agency but that the decision reflected her \"belief that meaningful change in our industry requires accountability and leadership that earns trust.\"\n\nRoan did not explicitly mention Epstein in her post, but it comes after The Wrap and The Hollywood Reporter reported about turmoil inside the agency over the CEO's appearance in the files.\n\nRepresentatives for Wasserman Music did not respond to a request for comment. The CEO has previously said he regrets the association.\n\nWasserman appeared in the most recent tranche of Epstein-related documents released by the DOJ. Appearing in the files does not necessarily suggest that a person has engaged in wrongdoing.\n\nThe documents included flirtatious email exchanges between Wasserman and Ghislaine Maxwell from 2003.\n\nMaxwell was convicted in December 2021 of five counts related to a sex trafficking scheme involving minors with Epstein. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2022.\n\nWasserman, who is also the chairman of LA28, the organizing committee for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles, apologized in a statement on January 31.\n\n\"I deeply regret my correspondence with Ghislaine Maxwell, which took place over two decades ago, long before her horrific crimes came to light,\" he said. \"I never had a personal or business relationship with Jeffrey Epstein. As is well documented, I went on a humanitarian trip as part of a delegation with the Clinton Foundation in 2002 on the Epstein plane. I am terribly sorry for having any association with either of them.\"\n\nRoan, whose name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz, has been repped by the talent agency Wasserman since 2023. She is the latest star to leave the agency amidst the Epstein fallout. The artists Beach Bunny, Wednesday, and Bethany Cosentino from Best Coast walked away from the agency in the past week. In 2024, Billie Eilish left the agency for other reasons.",

    "fullText": "Elon Musk says he's happy to lose one lunar milestone if it helps him win the bigger prize.\n\nThe SpaceX chief said in a post on X on Monday that he would congratulate Blue Origin if it lands on the moon before SpaceX, as his company focuses on a more ambitious goal: building a \"self-growing city\" on the moon.\n\n\"What really matters for the future is being able to land millions of tons of equipment and people to build a self-growing city on the moon,\" Musk wrote. \"In this respect, perhaps we are be more the tortoise than the hare for now,\" he added.\n\nMusk's comments about SpaceX being more \"tortoise than the hare\" came in response to an X post by Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos, who shared a black-and-white image of a tortoise. The post on Monday appeared to be a nod to the tortoise-and-hare fable, framing Blue Origin as the slow-and-steady contender and SpaceX as the faster but more distracted rival.\n\nMusk and Bezos have been rivals for years, frequently clashing over their space ambitions at SpaceX and Blue Origin, as well as over their fortunes.\n\nAfter long touting Mars as SpaceX's main destination, Musk said on Sunday that the company has shifted its focus to the moon.\n\n\"For those unaware, SpaceX has already shifted focus to building a self-growing city on the moon, as we can potentially achieve that in less than 10 years, whereas Mars would take 20+ years,\" he wrote in a post on X.\n\n\"That said, SpaceX will also strive to build a Mars city and begin doing so in about 5 to 7 years, but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the moon is faster,\" he added.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported on Friday that SpaceX told investors it is targeting March 2027 for an uncrewed landing on the moon.\n\nIn a separate post on X, Musk said on Sunday that SpaceX would \"continue to launch directly from Earth to Mars while possible, rather than moon to Mars.\"\n\n\"Fuel is relatively scarce on the moon,\" Musk added.\n\nMusk previously said SpaceX would send an uncrewed mission to Mars by the end of 2026.\n\n\"No, we're going straight to Mars. The moon is a distraction,\" he said in January last year in response to a post on X.\n\nMusk is known for rolling out bold timelines for projects such as electric vehicles — only to revise or abandon them later.\n\nBezos has long emphasised the moon as humanity's next destination, and has taken aim at Musk's push to colonize Mars.\n\n\"Go live on the top of Mount Everest for a year first and see if you like it, because it's a garden paradise compared to Mars,\" Bezos said in 2019.\n\nDuring a presentation for project Blue Moon, Bezos included a slide about Mars with the title \"FAR, FAR AWAY,\" referencing SpaceX's Mars ambition.\n\nBlue Origin said previously it aimed to reach the moon by 2023 — a target it did not meet.",

    "title": "Giants' Buster Posey casts a wary eye on adrenaline generated in WBC",
    "description": "Instead of building toward the regular season in spring training, players in the WBC will step right into a playoff atmosphere. \"It can derail some pitchers.\"",
    "fullText": "Come early March, a small, but mighty group of San Francisco Giants will disperse from camp in Scottsdale, Ariz., suit up in their home country's colors and gear up for the triennial World Baseball Classic.\n\nThe WBC is a two-week tournament played in Puerto Rico, Japan, Houston and Miami and jam-packed with playoff intensity. The 2023 tournament left viewers on a high when Shohei Ohtani struck out Team USA's Mike Trout swinging at a nasty breaking ball to seal Team Japan's title.\n\nThree years ago, former Giants Camilo Doval and Joc Pederson competed. This year, eight Giants big leaguers will participate as well as three coaches, two press officers, one minor league infielder, one minor league hitting coach and, perhaps most notably, one athletic trainer. They will represent 13 countries: USA, Great Britain, Puerto Rico, South Korea, Venezuela, Colombia, Israel, Italy, Brazil, Australia, Netherlands, Mexico and Nicaragua.\n\nSeveral Giants wll play leading roles for their teams, including Logan Webb for Team USA, Jung Hoo Lee for South Korea and Heliot Ramos for Puerto Rico. There are variables that come into play for the big leaguers participating as the Giants ramp up for the 2026 season with an entirely new coaching staff, hoping to push off from the .500 record that's entrapped them for the better part of this decade.\n\nThat Dave Groeschner - the Giants' longtime head athletic trainer, will lend his services to Team USA - alongside Webb comes as a huge relief to the Giants front office.\n\nGroeschner will be able to closely monitor Webb's condition and report back to the team's head honchos about their ace as the tournament progresses. The most important variable for all teams, including the Giants, will be to keep in touch with their players' progress for those two-ish weeks they'll be outside their purview. But Webb is of extra concern given his status at the top of the rotation and his workload over the last few seasons.\n\nPresident of baseball operations Buster Posey expressed clear concern about risks associated with the WBC, particularly with starting pitchers in their prime. Posey, who played in the 2017 WBC, said at the winter meetings that it's a \"great event,\" but thought it was better fit for pitchers in the later stage of their careers.\n\nClayton Kershaw, who retired after the Los Angeles Dodgers' World Series title this fall, will pitch for the USA this March, for example. The decision to participate lies with the player, though, and Webb wants to play after having opted out in 2023.\n\nThere's high hopes for Team USA to make the semifinal round in Miami, which means Webb would get the full WBC experience. That means his ramp up, one he's had down to a science ready to be Opening Day starter four consecutive seasons, will have to be slightly modified.\n\nIn practice, that means the Giants will be in communications with USA manager Mark DeRosa - a member of San Francisco's 2010 World Series-winning team - about Webb's usage. Strict workload rules are already in place: In the pool round (Team USA will be in Houston for this round), no pitcher can throw more than 65 pitches in an outing. If Team USA makes the quarterfinals, which begin March 13, that number goes up to 80. And for the semifinals and championship, spanning March 15-17, the pitch count ticks up to 95.\n\nThe limitations generally comply with how a starting pitcher's ramp-up looks in spring, and tournament officials send data to MLB teams from their players' outings. But the Giants are most concerned about the atmosphere, how the high leverage, adrenaline-filled games might alter a month in which players are typically dedicated to pace and caution.\n\n\"We've also seen over the years that it can derail some pitchers, because there's no way to replicate getting yourself ready for, essentially, a playoff baseball atmosphere in early March,\" Posey said in December at the Winter Meetings in Orlando, Fla.\n\nIn 2023, the New York Mets lost closer Edwin Diaz for the season when he tore his patellar tendon in a Puerto Rico victory celebration gone awry. Posey might also be thinking about Ryan Vogelsong, who pitched for the USA in 2013 and had a rocky start to his season weeks later - a 7.19 ERA in his first nine starts.\n\nThose scenarios are a bit less of a concern for non-starters, who may not be pitching in such high-leverage spots. More of a concern for the rest - Ramos, Lee, Tristan Beck, Luis Arráez, Reiver Sanmartin, Jose Butto, Harrrison Bader - will be the gap in acclimating with almost an entirely new coaching staff.\n\nAll the Giants' WBC players will be reporting back to rookie manager Tony Vitello and his new-look staff. Ramos, Lee, Bader and Arráez will report to hitting coaches Hunter Mense and Oscar Bernard about how their batting practices feel. Webb, Butto, Beck and Sanmartin will have more involved talks with new pitching coaches Justin Meccage, Frank Anderson, Jesse Chavez and Christian Wonders to update on their bullpen sessions.\n\nSpring training isn't the only runway for players to get to know their coaches. Many have been collaborating in Arizona all winter, well before Tuesday's pitchers and catchers reporting date (the coaches have been in their roles for months despite the official hiring announcement not coming out until last Friday).\n\nThis article originally published at Giants' Buster Posey casts a wary eye on adrenaline generated in WBC.",

    "fullText": "The highly anticipated men’s ice hockey tournament will kick off on Wednesday, but ahead of that, the women’s competition has already delivered some memorable moments, including standout performances from a pair of local Manitoban defenders representing Team Canada.\n\nWinnipeg native Kati Tabin and Ste. Anne’s Jocelyne Larocque have both played meaningful roles on Canada’s blue line, helping the defending champions open the tournament with two dominant victories. Canada began round-robin play with a convincing 4-0 shutout of Switzerland before following it up with a 5-1 win over Czechia on Monday.\n\nTabin has been used in more of a depth role through the opening games but has continued to make the most of her opportunities. In the tournament opener against Switzerland, she logged 9:53 of ice time and recorded two shots on goal. Her role expanded in the second game, as she saw her minutes climb to 13:42 against Czechia, though she was held without a shot.\n\nLarocque, meanwhile, has taken on a heavier workload and has been a steady presence on the back end. The veteran defenseman played 21:12 in Canada’s opening win, finishing the game with two shots on net while helping anchor the defensive effort. In the second game, her ice time dipped slightly to 17:17 as Tabin’s role increased, but Larocque remained an important part of Canada’s defensive rotation.\n\nANOTHER WIN IN THE BOOKS 🇨🇦\n\nTeam Canada improves to 2-0 following their win over Czechia at #MilanoCortina2026 👏 pic.twitter.com/QwHXUZLvZH\n\n— Sportsnet (@Sportsnet) February 9, 2026\n\nWith two wins already secured, Canada now turns its attention to the final game of the round robin, a highly anticipated matchup against its long-time rival, the United States.

    "fullText": "San Francisco 49ers defensive lineman Keion White was shot in the ankle during an event on Monday morning.\n\nWhite was shot at 4:06 a.m. on the 17th block of Mission Street in San Francisco, a San Francisco Police spokesman said, via The Athletic. There was an altercation between two groups that broke out at an event there that led to the shooting, though specifics of that incident are not yet known. White is not believed to have been part of that altercation, though he was shot in the ankle.\n\nHe was taken by police to a nearby hospital, and is expected to be OK.\n\n“Keion White was a victim of a shooting and sustained a bullet wound to his ankle this morning in San Francisco,\" the 49ers said in a statement. \"He is currently undergoing surgery at a local hospital. We will provide further updates when appropriate.”\n\nThe incident took place hours after the Seattle Seahawks beat the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX at Levi's Stadium on the other side of the Bay Area. The stadium sits more than 40 miles away in Santa Clara, south of San Francisco. White was at the Super Bowl, and was spotted wearing a Patriots hat.\n\nWhite was traded to the 49ers in October from the Patriots, who selected him with the No. 46 overall pick in 2023. White had 18 total tackles and 1.5 sacks in 14 games this season. The 27-year-old has one year left on his initial four-year, $7.7 million deal. The 49ers went 12-5 this past season and reached the playoffs, though they were knocked out in the divisional round.\n\nWhite is now the second 49ers player to be shot in recent years. Wide receiver Ricky Pearsall was shot in the chest during an attempted robbery in San Francisco ahead of his rookie season in 2024. Pearsall ended up returning to play in 11 games during that season.",

He held the same position with the New Orleans Saints in 2024.\n\nKubiak will replace former Raiders coach Pete Carroll, who was fired in January after one season. The 2025-26 Raiders (3-14) scored the fewest points and totaled the fewest yards in the NFL. They owned the worst rushing attack and fifth-worst passing game.\n\nThe 2025-26 Seahawks offense totaled the third-most points and eighth-most yards in the NFL, with the No. 8 passing attack and No. 10 running game.\n\n\"There's a lot of really dang good football players on this roster.\"\n\nKlint Kubiak on what drew him to Seattle. pic.twitter.com/z5yhP3ow51— Seattle Seahawks (@Seahawks) February 11, 2025\n\nKubiak was previously linked to openings with the Arizona Cardinals, Atlanta Falcons, Baltimore Ravens, Miami Dolphins and New York Giants.\n\nJoe Brady, Brian Daboll, Jeff Hafley, Vance Joseph, Mike McDaniel and Kevin Stefanski were among the other previous candidates to fill the Raiders vacancy.",

    "fullText": "The Raiders have named Klint Kubiak head coach of the franchise, less than 24 hours after his former employer won Super Bowl LX.\n\nKubiak, 38, is the oldest son of former Texans and Broncos coach Gary Kubiak. The elder Kubiak won Super Bowl 50 as coach of the Broncos.\n\nOn the field after the 29-13 win over the Patriots, Kubiak made it clear that he'd be taking the job. Which means he'd been offered the job at some point before the game. Which also means the Raiders had run afoul of the tampering policy by doing more than simply interviewing Kubiak.\n\nIt's unlikely the league will do anything about it, unless the Seahawks file a complaint. Given that they won the Super Bowl and fully expected Kubiak to go, it's unlikely they'll make an issue out of it.\n\nThe league could, if it wanted. But the tampering policy is enforced sporadically and unpredictably. Look for this to become just another example of a team disregarded the terms of the tampering policy, without consequence.\n\nIt's a far from ideal way to do business, but that's how NFL business is usually done.",

    "description": "Five standout athletes, including Jacob Arter and Anna Hartig, were inducted into the Lancaster High School Gary Mauller Athletic Wall of Honor.",
    "fullText": "LANCASTER — It was a night of celebration on Feb. 6 as five new members were inducted into the Lancaster High School Gary Mauller Athletic Wall of Honor.\n\nThe induction ceremony occurred before the boys' varsity basketball game against Reynoldsburg at Lancaster High School.\n\nThe Wall of Honor is named after Gary Mauller, an educator in the Lancaster City Schools for 47 years, serving as athletic director from 1989 to 1996. He always believed it was important to honor tradition and recognize outstanding efforts by Lancaster athletes.\n\nMauller began hanging pictures on the hallway wall during his tenure as athletic director. Upon Mauller’s passing in April of 2017, donations in his memory have enabled the continuation of his mission to recognize Lancaster High School’s athletic tradition.\n\nMore: What a remarkable ride: My journey from the MV News mail room to the OPSMA Hall of Fame\n\nJacob Arter (Class of 2017): A three-year varsity starter, second-team OCC in 2015 and 2016, and first-team OCC in 2017. He is second all-time on the boys’ basketball career points list with 1,171, third all-time career field goals made with 411, and sixth all-time for individual points scored in a single game with 38. In track and field, he was the OCC and regional high jump champion, qualifying for the state track and field championships as a senior. His 6-foot-7 jump is currently fourth best in Lancaster High School history. Arter was a walk-on at Ohio State University on the track and field team.\n\nDoug Conroy (Class of 1985): He was the Central Ohio League cross country individual champion his sophomore, junior, and senior seasons. Placed third in the state cross country meet in his senior year. He was the track and field Central Ohio League champion in the 800 and 1,600 during his sophomore, junior, and senior years. District champion in the 800, sophomore, junior, and senior, and district champion in the 1,600 as a sophomore. He was the regional champion in the 800 and 4x800 relay junior and senior years. District and regional in the 4x400 relay junior and senior, and second in his junior year and third in his senior year in the state championships in the 800. He received All-American distinction and was the Golden West Invitational 800 champion.\n\nAnna Hartig (Class of 2019): She earned 12 varsity letters during her high school career, excelling at soccer, basketball, and track and field.

In track and field, she was All-Ohio in 2017, as well as Academic All-Ohio, second team OCC in 2019, and third team OCC in 2018. Hartig graduated Cum Laude from Ohio State University in 2022 and will receive her Doctorate from the New England College of Optometry in 2027.\n\nKyle Mackie (Class of 1997): A 2011 Ohio Dominican University Athletic Hall of Fame inductee for his accomplishments on the baseball field. In 1998, he was second team All-Mid-Ohio Conference and first team in 1999, 2000, and 2001. He was an NAIA Academic All-American in 2000 and 2001.

    "fullText": "CORTINA D’AMPEZZO, Italy — Lindsey Vonn sustained a “complex tibia fracture that is currently stable but will require multiple surgeries to fix properly” after her devastating crash in the Olympic downhill, the skier said in a social media post late Monday.\n\nVonn posted on Instagram about her left leg injuries following her fall in Sunday’s race.\n\n“While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets,” Vonn said.\n\nNine days before Sunday’s crash, the 41-year-old Vonn ruptured the ACL in her left knee. It is an injury that sidelines pro athletes for months, but ski racers have on occasion competed that way. She appeared stable in two downhill training runs at the Milan Cortina Games.\n\nOnlookers on social media wondered if Vonn’s ruptured ACL could have played a factor in her crash near the top of the Olympia delle Tofana course, where she has a World Cup record 12 wins. That maybe, on a healthy left knee, she would not have clipped a gate and been able to stave off a crash.\n\n“Yesterday my Olympic dream did not finish the way I dreamt it would,” Vonn said. “It wasn’t a story book ending or a fairy tail, it was just life. I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it. Because in Downhill ski racing the difference between a strategic line and a catastrophic injury can be as small as 5 inches.\n\n“I was simply 5 inches too tight on my line when my right arm hooked inside of the gate, twisting me and resulted in my crash. My ACL and past injuries had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever.”\n\nVonn’s father said Monday that the American superstar will no longer race if he has any influence over her decision.\n\n“She’s 41 years old and this is the end of her career,” Alan Kildow said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press. “There will be no more ski races for Lindsey Vonn, as long as I have anything to say about it.”\n\nWhen she arrived in Cortina last week, Vonn said she had consulted with her team of physicians and trainers before deciding to move ahead with racing. The International Ski and Snowboard Federation does not check on the injury statuses of athletes.\n\n“I firmly believe that this has to be decided by the individual athlete,” FIS president Johan Eliasch said Monday in Bormio. “And in her case, she certainly knows her injuries on her body better than anybody else. And if you look around here today with all the athletes, the athletes yesterday, every single athlete has a small injury of some kind.\n\n“What is also important for people to understand, that the accident that she had yesterday, she was incredibly unlucky. It was a one in a 1,000,” Eliasch added. “She got too close to the gate, and she got stuck when she was in the air in the gate and started rotating. No one can recover from that, unless you do a 360. … This is something which is part of ski racing. It’s a dangerous sport.”\n\nThe Italian hospital in Treviso where Vonn was being treated said late Sunday she had undergone surgery to repair a broken left leg. The U.S. Ski Team has said only that Vonn “sustained an injury, but is in stable condition and in good hands with a team of American and Italian physicians.”\n\nPierre Ducrey, the sports director for the International Olympic Committee, noted Vonn was able to train and had experts counseling her decision.",

    "fullText": "Klint Kubiak is officially the head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, agreeing on a five-year contract, according to ESPN’s Adam Schefter.\n\nLeadership in place. #RaiderNation \n\n— Las Vegas Raiders (@Raiders) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Raiders and Kubiak struck an agreement on February 1, the morning after his second interview with the team. However, the Raiders had to wait until after Sunday’s Super Bowl in which Kubiak served his final game as the Seattle Seahawks’ offensive coordinator in a 29-13 winning effort. Kubiak confirmed after the game he was headed to Las Vegas.\n\nThe Raiders focused on Kubiak because he was a young offensive mind who has never been a head coach. The Raiders interviewed more than a dozen candidates, but Kubiak was their focus.\n\nKubiak, who turns 39 on February 17, was the Seahawks’ offensive coordinator 2025 and was wildly successful. Previously, he served in the same position with the New Orleans Saints and coached former Raiders quarterback Derek Carr in 2024 and with the Minnesota Vikings in 2021. He has 12 seasons experience as an NFL coach.\n\nKubiak is the son of Denver Broncos Super Bowl-winning head coach Gary Kubiak and the brother of San Francisco 49ers offensive coordinator Klay Kubiak, who also interviewed with the Raiders.\n\nReportedly, Raiders’ part owner Tom Brady, who helped lead the search, was a big fan of Klint Kubiak and he called several of the Seahawks’ games this season for Fox.\n\nNow, Brady and the Raiders hope Kubiak can led the offense, and likely new quarterback Fernando Mendoza into a new, winning era.",

    "fullText": "The big story over the weekend at the 2026 Olympic Winter Games in Sochi was Lindsey Vonn’s crash in the women’s downhill on Sunday. For Vonn, her Olympic experience in Milan was not supposed to end this way after an iconic career that saw her be one of the best female alpine skiing speed racers of all-time. The crash was simply spectacular, and the 41-year-old Olympic gold medalist from Saint Paul, Minnesota was heard screaming on the course as she was lifted by helicopter.\n\nWith the injury to Vonn, will many sports fans remember who won the Olympic gold medal in the women’s downhill? It just so happened to be another American in Breezy Johnson of Jackson, Wyoming.\n\nInside look at Johnson’s Olympic gold\n\nJohnson posted a winning time of 1:36.10. Emma Aicher of Germany won the silver medal with a time of 1:36.14. Sofia Goggia of Italy won the bronze medal with a time of 1:36.69. Johnson reached the podium by 0.86 seconds over Jacqueline Wiles of Portland, Oregon, and Cornelia Hutter of Austria, as they both had a fourth place time of 1:36.96.\n\nAt age 30, this is the first Olympic gold medal for Johnson in her impressive skiing career. She previously won two gold medals at the Alpine Skiing World Championships in Saalbach, Austria. Johnson won gold in the women’s downhill, and gold in the women’s team combined with another American icon in women’s alpine skiing, Mikaela Shiffrin of Vail, Colorado. Due to the fact that Johnson has been a big performance skier in the past, the Olympic gold medal in Cortina should not have been much of a surprise–even to Snoop Dogg, who was watching the women’s downhill with Lindsey’s father.\n\nUSA has two gold medals to date\n\nJohnson’s gold medal is one of two medals for the United States so far. They also placed first in the team figure skating competition. The Americans beat Italy by a single point. The Americans were led by quad and backflip artist Ilia Malinin in the men’s event, and ice dancers Madison Chock and Evan Bates in ice dance.\n\nThe post 2026 Winter Olympics: Did the Lindsey Vonn crash overshadow Breezy Johnson’s Olympic gold? appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "description": "Editor's Note: This article is published in partnership with Read The Line, a Golf Digest content partner.",
    "fullText": "For the third consecutive year, the historic Pebble Beach Golf Links has been awarded Signature Event status as a star-studded field descends upon this iconic venue. The opening two rounds will feature a Pro-Am format, with all players in the 80-man field paired alongside celebrities while rotating between Pebble Beach and Spyglass Hill.\n\nThe Signature Event designation means there will be no cut, allowing all 80 players to advance to the weekend for the final two rounds at Pebble Beach. World No. 1 Scottie Scheffler headlines the best field to date this year, also highlighted by the 2026 PGA Tour debut of defending Pebble Beach champion Rory McIlroy.\n\nLet’s dive into my top 10 contenders to watch as the best in the world take center stage at the 2026 AT&T Pebble Beach Pro-Am.\n\nOne of the keys to unlocking low scores at Pebble Beach is dominating the par 5s, as evidenced by Rory McIlroy’s two eagles last year that propelled him to victory. Enter Jake Knapp, the current leader in par-5 scoring average over his past 40 rounds.\n\nKnapp has become a familiar name on Sunday leader boards this season, posting three T-11-or-better finishes in all of his 2026 starts. He’s unbothered by the pesky Poa annua greens, ranking fourth in the field from inside 15 feet on Poa. Bomb it far and putt it well, Knapp will look to deploy the McIlroy game plan this week at Pebble.\n\nA shorter golf course, difficult-to-hit greens and excellent course history: Russell Henley checks every box at Pebble Beach. Nearly half of the approach shots come from inside 150 yards, playing directly into the strengths of the world’s No. 6-ranked player.\n\nHenley boasts a remarkably high floor, producing top-20 finishes in each of his past 10 PGA Tour starts. Pebble is an ideal fit for his game, and a course where he gained +7.5 strokes with the putter in 2025, his best putting performance of the past two years.\n\nCue the “home game” narrative. Maverick McNealy grew up with a home just off Pebble Beach and considers this his favorite tournament of the year. His course familiarity is second to none, but it’s his trending form that earns him a spot among my top contenders.\n\nMcNealy has gained strokes on the field in all four major statistical categories in each of his three starts in 2026. His consistently strong approach play and tendency to spike with the putter give him real upside for anyone looking deeper down the odds board.\n\nSince the summer of 2024, only Scottie Scheffler and Rory McIlroy have more PGA Tour wins than Chris Gotterup. His rapid ascent continued with his second victory of 2026, making birdie on six of his final seven holes to win the WM Phoenix Open in a playoff.\n\nHe’s built for the moment, relishing opportunities to take down the game’s titans and proving he has the clutch gene. His dominance off the tee alone can carry him to victory. The sky is the limit for Gotterup, and this rocket ship shows no signs of slowing down any time soon.\n\nA T-3 finish at the WM Phoenix Open once again left Si Woo Kim backers empty-handed after he shared the lead for much of Sunday in Scottsdale. Still, the world-class ball-striking continues, and it feels like only a matter of time before the putts finally fall when it matters most.\n\nEventually, this hourglass of elite form will run out. Until then, Kim led the field tee to green last week and continues to put himself in contention regardless of course style or location. One of the tour’s most aggressive players, his moment is coming during this run.\n\nPebble Beach is often won on the back of precise, demanding approach play into the smallest greens on the PGA Tour, and that points directly to Viktor Hovland. He attacked the treacherous pin locations at TPC Scottsdale, firing a 9-under weekend to vault himself into a top-10 finish.\n\nHardcore golf fans will remember the 2018 U.S. Amateur, held at Pebble Beach and won by a free-spirited, immensely talented young Norwegian named Viktor Hovland. He looks well-suited to add another victory on the Pacific cliffs and reestablish himself among the world’s elite.\n\nTwenty-six years after making his professional debut, Justin Rose sits No. 3 in the world at age 45. It’s truly amazing. Rose captured his 13th PGA Tour title two weeks ago at Torrey Pines, surpassing $75 million in career earnings along the way.\n\nIt’s been an extraordinary career, and Rose remains a legitimate threat any time he tees it up. At this stage, he chooses his spots carefully, and Pebble Beach is always circled. A winner here in 2023, he’s more than capable of adding another trophy this week.\n\nIt’s been just over five months since Tommy Fleetwood’s last PGA Tour start, arguably the feel-good moment of the season, when he finally shed the monkey off his back by winning the 2025 Tour Championship.\n\nHe followed that up with another victory on the DP World Tour in October and enters 2026 primed for a run toward the top. Fleetwood’s elite wedge play on a shorter-than-average course gives him a real chance to neutralize the game’s biggest hitters at the top.\n\nPebble Beach. The Players. The Masters. The Irish Open. The Ryder Cup. 2025 was a dream season, the best of Rory McIlroy’s career, and it all started here. McIlroy dismantled Pebble Beach, overpowering it with driver and taking unimaginable lines over doglegs en route to a comfortable two-shot victory.\n\nHe returns to defend his title, making his PGA Tour season debut after eight consecutive DP World Tour starts. Does he have enough in the tank for another heavyweight battle with Scheffler in 2026? Like most golf fans, I can’t wait to find out.\n\nIn the opening round of the WM Phoenix Open, Scottie Scheffler finally looked human. He spotted the leader 10 shots through 18 holes and still nearly won the tournament. We saw his worst, and only two players in the 123-man field managed to beat him in the end.\n\nIf that doesn’t illustrate the massive gap between Scheffler and the rest of the PGA Tour, nothing does. He’s a deserving, prohibitive favorite once again, continuing his reign as the best player walking the planet. Scottie Scheffler sits atop my power rankings, and it isn’t particularly close.\n\nJoe Idone is a Read The Line contributor and host of the Preferred Lines podcast.",

    "fullText": "Former Detroit Lions defender Tracy Scroggins has died at the age of 56, his family announced Feb. 9.\n\n\"It is with profound sadness that we announce the passing of our beloved Tracy Scroggins,\" his family said in a statement provided to TMZ.\n\n\"Tracy was a devoted father, cherished family member, and loyal friend whose life was marked by remarkable strength and perseverance. While many knew him for his career as a professional football player in the NFL, those closest to him knew him as a kind-hearted and generous man who cared deeply for his family and friends.\"\n\nThe family also revealed in its announcement of Scroggins death that the 56-year-old had suffered from chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) during his post-playing career.\n\n\"Playing in the NFL gave Tracy the opportunity to pursue his lifelong dream and to rise from poverty,\" the statement read. \"However, unfortunately, the NFL was also ultimately the cause of his untimely demise. Tracy spent every moment of retirement courageously battling the devastating effects of CTE. While our hearts are heavy, we find comfort in knowing that he is finally at peace.\"\n\nScroggins was one of nearly 5,000 players to file concussion-related lawsuits against the NFL before the league's sweeping concussion settlement in 2015.\n\nScroggins filed an additional claim against the NFL in 2016. His lawyer at the time – Tim Howard – stating his client was suffering from symptoms consistent with CTE, which can only be diagnosed with a postmortem brain examination.\n\n\"He can't remember where he is or where he's going,\" Howard told USA TODAY Sports in 2016. \"He hasn't been able to hold a job over the last six years. Beyond memory issues, he suffers from depression and has angry outbursts.\"\n\nScroggins played 10 NFL seasons, all for the Lions, after being selected in the second round of the 1992 NFL Draft. The Tulsa product played 142 games and made 89 starts while playing both defensive end and linebacker.\n\nScroggins racked up 60.5 career sacks – good for the seventh-most in franchise history – and was named the 90th-greatest player in franchise history by Dave Birkett of the Detroit Free Press – a member of the USA TODAY Network – in 2019.\n\nScroggins told The Detroit News in 2016 that he \"doesn't have any regrets\" about his career – with one caveat.\n\n\"I think things happen, sometimes for a reason,\" Scroggins said. \"But if I had the knowledge that players today have, I think that probably my career would’ve been five years shorter than it was.\"\n\nThe Lions paid homage to Scroggins with a social media post shortly after his death was announced:\n\nWe join the NFL community in mourning the loss of Lions Legend Tracy Scroggins, who played his entire 10-year in Detroit (1992-2001). pic.twitter.com/TdLRRXAWhn\n\n— Detroit Lions (@Lions) February 10, 2026\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Former Detroit Lions star dies after battling CTE, family announces",

    "fullText": "Most seem to agree that the St. Louis Cardinals have had a very active and successful offseason, but how likely is it that they still might trade JoJo Romero? There are many questions including if, to who and when.\n\nAs of today, the St. Louis Cardinals are only days away from pitchers and catchers reporting to Spring Training in Jupiter, Florida. There are still rumblings that the trade winds haven’t stopped blowing yet as JoJo Romero is reportedly still being discussed with other teams. While I can’t confirm that anything is close, a trade of JoJo is still possible. The most recent reporting I can find about Romero’s status came from MLB Trade Rumors just a few days ago on February 6. They asked their audience if they believe the St. Louis Cardinals will complete another trade before opening day and nearly 66% said yes.\n\nThe teams that reportedly have expressed the most interest in JoJo Romero are the New York Yankees, the Seattle Mariners and the Baltimore Orioles also according to MLB Trade Rumors. I’ve also seen mock trades suggested from the Toronto Blue Jays, but cannot confirm if that interest is serious. I thought there was a chance we’d see JoJo moved along with Brendan Donovan when his trade to the Seattle Mariners happened, but the fact that it didn’t makes me think that Chaim Bloom may have a different timeline in mind for JoJo.\n\nI’m wondering now if the St. Louis Cardinals are going to try and position JoJo Romero as a closer and then move him at the trade deadline when that market might be hot. That’s a gamble, but it might be the frame of mind that Chaim Bloom and his team have now that the ramp up to the season gets closer. I am reminded of an interview that the St. Louis Post-Dispatch had with JoJo late last season about what he learned from former Cardinals closer Ryan Helsley. Could it be that the Cardinals will set up closer by committee with JoJo and Riley O’Brien sharing that role?\n\nDo you think that the St. Louis Cardinals will trade JoJo Romero? If the answer is yes, do you think it should happen before Opening Day or at the trade deadline? If no, why are you in favor of holding onto him? I think we’ll find out sooner rather than later of what the St. Louis Cardinals are thinking about the future of JoJo Romero whether he’s a prime trade opportunity now or a bigger trade chip as a closer near the deadline this summer.",

    "description": "Mbappé vs. the Officials, Abuse in the Stands, and a Young Back Line That Held Firm",
    "fullText": "Real Madrid trips to Mestalla are rarely straightforward, and while the 2–0 scoreline suggests control, plenty of drama unfolded away from the goals. From sideline tension involving Kylian Mbappé to ugly scenes in the stands and a remarkably youthful defensive performance, here are a few moments from Sunday night that flew under the radar.\n\nKylian Mbappé was visibly frustrated with the officiating, particularly over an offside decision late in the first half. According to footage broadcast by DAZN, the French forward confronted the fourth official as players were heading down the tunnel at halftime, demanding clarification.\n\nMbappé questioned how the play could possibly be offside and asked for an explanation. The official responded by saying the call was determined by the broadcast camera angle and suggested discussing it inside the stadium. Mbappé agreed, insisting he wanted clarity because the decision made no sense to him.\n\nHowever, the explanation never came. As players prepared to return for the second half, Mbappé once again approached the fourth official, clearly irritated that he had been brushed off. He complained that he had been asked to speak inside, only to be ignored entirely. Realizing the conversation was going nowhere, Mbappé turned to Eduardo Camavinga nearby and muttered his verdict on the refereeing crew, calling them “clowns.”\n\nMbappé: “How is that offside? I’m asking about my position.”\n\nRef: “Sorry, we’ll talk inside.”\n\nMbappé: “I don’t understand.”\n\nRef: “Come inside.”\n\nMbappé: “I’m inside, so why won’t you talk to me?”pic.twitter.com/BQlEYYbSuX\n\n— 10 (@Kylian) February 8, 2026\n\nAs has become increasingly common in recent visits to Mestalla, the tension wasn’t limited to the pitch. Movistar cameras captured an unsettling incident involving a Real Madrid supporter seated among Valencia fans during the second half.\n\nThe fan, wearing a Madrid scarf, was confronted by several local supporters. During the altercation, his scarf was taken from him and tossed into the air. When he climbed down to retrieve it, another Valencia fan aggressively snatched it away again, while others nearby appeared to scold the aggressor.\n\nThe situation escalated as the Madrid supporter was escorted away by police. From above, another individual leaned over the railing, attempted to strike him, and ultimately spat in his direction — all clearly visible on the broadcast.\n\nThis was not the only disturbing moment involving the crowd. Later in the match, when referee Alberola Rojas paused play so a spectator could receive medical attention, sections of the Mestalla crowd broke into chants of “Mbappé, son of a bitch,” further highlighting the toxic atmosphere.\n\nMbappé would have the final word on the night, though. On his first visit to Mestalla, after being kept quiet for much of the game, he sealed Madrid’s win with a late goal in stoppage time.\n\nLost amid the noise and controversy was one of the most impressive aspects of Madrid’s performance: a defense built almost entirely on youth.\n\nWith injuries piling up and several senior defenders unavailable or not fully fit, Raúl González Blanco and Álvaro Arbeloa (via squad circumstances) were forced into fielding an extraordinarily young back four. David Jiménez (21), Raúl Asensio (22), Dean Huijsen (20), and Álvaro Carreras (22) started together, giving the defense an average age of just over 21 years. All were Spanish, and all but Huijsen came through the club’s academy system.\n\nIt was a lineup more reminiscent of Castilla than a La Liga clash at Mestalla. With no Rüdiger, Alaba, Carvajal, Mendy, Militão, or Fran García available, Madrid’s defensive average age dipped below 22 — a staggering number for a league match of this magnitude.\n\nJimenez, Asencio, Huijsen, Carreras. Was this the youngest backline fielded by a team in La Liga this season? It has to be up there, if not the youngest based on average age.\n\n— Managing Madrid (@managingmadrid) February 10, 2026\n\nAnd yet, the young back line barely put a foot wrong. Valencia were largely kept at arm’s length, Thibaut Courtois enjoyed one of his quietest nights in recent memory, and Madrid walked away with a clean sheet from one of the league’s most hostile venues.\n\nGiven the circumstances, the result was impressive. Given the age of the players tasked with seeing it through, it was even more so.",

    "description": "We ask Dolphins fans what they took from the Seahawks victory in the Super Bowl that the Phins should apply to the team.",
    "fullText": "So another NFL season has come and gone, ending last evening with the Super Bowl, which was won by the Seattle Seahawks. Seattle won the old school way, or the way I would prefer our very own Miami Dolphins to play. A stifling defense based on a solid pass rush and a solid secondary, and an offense with one of the better or best offensive lines and a back or two who can run it down your throat even when the opponent knows that you are going to run it down their throats.\n\nThe NFL is, if nothing else, a copycat league. There is more than one organization that saw the beatdown that the New England Patriots took last night and decided that they needed to do more of that, whichever part of the above they wanted to embrace and emulate. The run game didn’t destroy the Patriots, but it was enough to keep the offense moving, even if it ended in field goals more often than not.\n\nSam Darnold did make some plays, and some of those were very lucky not be picked, but after a while, you could tell that Seattle could feel it on defense and went into more of a play-it-safe mode overall. On the other side of the coin, Drake Maye was pestered all night, making him look more like the second-year player he is than the MVP runner-up that he also is. Maye had two touchdowns to Darnold’s one, but he also took seven sacks and threw two costly interceptions. Darnold threw no interceptions and took only one sack.\n\nAs a side note, the one highlight for the Patriots was Christian Gonzalez, who was the one player that seemed to keep the Pats somewhat in the game for more than a half. So now we have the dumb luck of facing that dude for the next several years twice a year.\n\nSo tonights Phinsider Question Of The Day is:\n\nWhat did you, as a Miami Dolphins fan, see from last evening’s game and victory by the Seahawks that you hope the new front office and coaching staff employ in their own plan to rebuild this team to something that looks respectable? On the other side of things, what did you see Seattle do that you hope the Dolphins do not grasp onto in their own rebuild?\n\nPlease share your thoughts and answers in the comments section below-",

It’s being out there, missing the feeling of being out there, offense, defense. Just competing at a high level because I’m a competitor first,” Yabusele said.\n\nThis is just another chapter in what has been an interesting career for the Frenchman. Yabusele was drafted by the Celtics in 2016 and spent two seasons with them before finding his way out of the NBA. He spent five seasons overseas before returning to the NBA last year, posting a breakout season with the Philadelphia 76ers that earned him his most recent Knicks' contract.\n\nSince being acquired, Yabusele has averaged nearly 30 minutes per game in two appearances with the Bulls and is in the starting lineup for Monday's game against the Nets.\n\nYabusele has already posted one double-double and is averaging 12.5 points with Chicago. He's also been impressive defensively, racking up two blocks and three steals in his first two appearances.\n\nThese numbers are much more efficient from his time in New York, where he averaged 2.7 points and 2.1 rebounds in 8.9 minutes per game.\n\nGiven his story, it'll be quite interesting to see if Yabusele's second half in Chicago is enough to earn him a contract for next season.\n\nCoby White feels 'wanted' by Charlotte after trade to Hornets\n\nTravis Scott screams after James Harden's Cavaliers debut\n\nNic Claxton reveals thoughts following Cam Thomas' release\n\nJJ Redick reveals thoughts on Luke Kennard-Gabe Vincent trade\n\nGuerschon Yabusele's Bulls performance proves Mike Brown didn't use him properly\n\nHornets make 26-year franchise history in win vs. Rockets",

Kubiak arrived in Las Vegas on Monday fresh off a 29-13 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday.  If Kubiak brings coaches with him from Seattle, he could consider quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko for offensive coordinator and Aden Durde on the defensive side.",
    "fullText": "HENDERSON, Nev. (AP) — The Las Vegas Raiders made it official Monday by announcing Seattle Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak will be their next head coach.\n\nKubiak arrived in Las Vegas on Monday fresh off a 29-13 Super Bowl victory over the New England Patriots on Sunday.\n\nAmong the questions facing Kubiak, who will be formally introduced Tuesday, as he takes over:\n\n— Who he will hire as his coordinators on offense and defense?\n\nIf Kubiak brings coaches with him from Seattle, he could consider quarterbacks coach Andrew Janocko for offensive coordinator and Aden Durde on the defensive side. It obviously would be a promotion for Janocko, though Kubiak might call the plays. Durde is the Seahawks' DC, but he would have the opportunity to have full control of the defense, unlike in Seattle where coach Mike Macdonald calls plays on that side of the ball.\n\n— What to do about defensive end Maxx Crosby?\n\nTwo NFL reporters have said that the Raiders' star pass rusher wants out. He wasn't happy about being placed on injured reserve with two games left this past season and might not have the appetite for another rebuild attempt. Crosby said on “The Herd with Colin Cowherd” that no such talk came from him, but he also didn't deny he wanted out.\n\nThe Raiders could get a haul by trading the 28-year-old Crosby and perhaps even accelerate the rebuild. Dallas got two first-rounders and three-time Pro Bowl defensive tackle Kenny Clark by shipping Micah Parsons to Green Bay.\n\n— How will he prepare for free agency and the draft?\n\nLas Vegas has the No. 1 pick and more than $91 million in salary cap space, according to overthecap.com, so the Raiders have the opportunity to greatly upgrade their roster. It's almost certain they will use that top pick on Fernando Mendoza, who won the Heisman Trophy and quarterbacked Indiana to the national championship.\n\nBut the Raiders will need to surround Mendoza with a lot more talent than is currently on the roster. Their top priorities likely will be improving the offensive line and finding a No. 1 wide receiver. The defense doesn't have a glaring weakness, but can use help throughout that side of the ball.\n\nKubiak, 38, confirmed during an on-field interview with NFL Network after the Seahawks won the Super Bowl on Sunday that he was heading to Las Vegas. Not that it was a surprise.\n\nKubiak and the Raiders began working toward finalizing an agreement more than a week ago for him to take the job, a person with knowledge of the discussions said at the time. The person spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because no contract was in place and no announcement could be made until after the Super Bowl in Santa Clara, California.\n\nHe'll be the third coach in three seasons for the Raiders and fifth full-time leader since they moved to Las Vegas in 2020. He succeeds Pete Carroll, who went 3-14 in one season in Las Vegas after a storied run with Seattle that included two Super Bowl appearances and one championship.\n\nThe Raiders have been searching for a path back to their glory days. Three Lombardi Trophies sit in the team’s facility, but the Raiders haven’t won a playoff game since their last Super Bowl appearance in the 2002 season. They have made the postseason just twice since, most recently in the 2021 season.\n\nKubiak oversaw a Seahawks offense that went from being ranked 18th the year before in scoring to third in the NFL this season and from 14th to eighth in yardage.\n\nHis work with quarterback Sam Darnold was particularly notable. Darnold completed 67.7% of his passes for 4,048 yards with 25 touchdowns and 14 interceptions this season. Drafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold had been considered a bust until leading Minnesota to a 14-win season in 2024. But the Vikings moved on from Darnold, and he proved that season was no fluke, winning 14 games in the regular season with Seattle and three \n\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl",

    "title": "Time is running out to get a WNBA deal done",
    "description": "The WNBA season is scheduled to start in three months, but there is still no contract between players and the league.",
    "fullText": "After meeting face-to-face a week ago, it seems the WNBA and the players are back to negotiating. It was reported that after the players submitted a CBA proposal to the league in December, the WNBA still hadn’t responded to it in February. The sides met in person in New York last week, with over 40 players attending in person or over Zoom. At that meeting, the league still did not have a response ready for them, but submitted their latest proposal later in the week, on Friday.\n\nWhile the league did not budge much on the matters of money — particularly on revenue sharing models — they have appeared to concede a few things to the players. After wanting to take away housing benefits in the league completely, this newest proposal from the league now has housing covered for players with under three years of WNBA service. Players will be entitled to a one-bedroom apartment for the first three years of their WNBA careers, with new developmental players being offered a studio apartment.\n\nBreanna Stewart told Jack Maloney of CBS Sports at Unrivaled this week that the WNBA conceding on a few of those smaller points was important, and that it “means that the league heard us on things that matter to us,” she said.\n\nYet, this proposal ultimately will not be accepted by the players, mostly because the league still isn’t offering enough when it comes to revenue-sharing percentage. According to Maloney’s report, there is still a huge gap between the sides on this topic — the players want 30% of gross revenue to be given back to them, resulting in a team salary cap aboove $10 million per year and a max individual player salary of about $2.5 million. The WNBA is still only offering about half of that.\n\nTime continues to tick on the clock to get a deal done, though. The WNBA season is scheduled to start in exactly three months. Training camp usually starts about 2-3 weeks before that, with the WNBA Draft happening a week before camp kicks off. That’s a month right there. There are over 100 free agents who need to negotiate and sign new individual player contracts, setting the league up for an unprecedented free agency period in extremely limited time.\n\nPlus, with two new expansion teams in Toronto and Portland being added to the league this year, an expansion draft also still needs to happen. With no CBA in place, there are no rules on what the expansion draft will look like, and therefore, Toronto and Portland have been unable to fully prepare for that draft. Whenever a new CBA does get signed, existing WNBA teams will need to take time to prepare their protected player lists under whatever new rules are going to be in place, and then the expansion teams will need to receive those lists and prepare accordingly. It’s not something that can happen in just the span of a few days.\n\nAll of this to say, we are starting to cut it close. The players can feel it, as Stewart expressed in the interview with CBS. There is only so much time to negotiate before the start of the season will need to be pushed back. There isn’t a hard date being publicly discussed right now, but the overwhelming belief in my conversations with people around the league is that if something doesn’t happen before February is over, the start of the season could be affected.\n\nSo far, there is no serious talk about the players planning a strike. The union voted to authorize their executive committee to initiate a strike back in December, with 98% of the union voting yes. For now, though, it seems like both sides are at least making token efforts in the hope it doesn’t get to that point.",

    "fullText": "Manolo González rued his side’s poor defensive performance as Villarreal put four goals past Espanyol in a Monday night thrashing at the Estadio de la Cerámica.\n\nEspanyol have struggled for form since Christmas with Monday’s 4-1 loss extending their winless run to six games across all competitions, and González stressed that “we need to reset now.”\n\n“We’ve got to find our competitiveness again. We need to reset now; we need to go back to attacking without conceding.\n\nVillarreal took a two-goal lead into the break after an acrobatic finish from Georges Mikautadze and an own goal from Jose Salinas.\n\n“The first half shouldn’t have been a 2-0 scoreline, no way. In the second half, we tried to push forward, but they caught us on the transition and killed the game off.\n\n“Villarreal are a talented team, but the goals were avoidable,” the 47-year-old commented post-match.\n\n“They went to the limit and we didn’t. We didn’t finish our counterattacks and we couldn’t get ourselves ahead on the scoreboard, and then the third goal at the start of the second half complicated the match.\n\n“We have to look forward and get back to our best, giving everything on the pitch. We’ve got to take a step forward and turn this situation around.”\n\nThe next two fixtures aren’t likely to be kind to the Catalan side, who host an in-form Celta Vigo side on Saturday before making the trip to face third-placed Atlético Madrid a week later.",

    "fullText": "Suwon Bluewings begin another season in a division they still feel they do not belong in — but one that recent failures suggest they do. After two unsuccessful promotion attempts, the club has turned to Lee Jung-hyo to end the nightmare. Can he restore Suwon to their rightful place, or are the Bluewings becoming a K League 2 fixture?\n\n*Defeated 3-0 by Jeju SK on aggregate in the playoffs.\n\nThe consequences of Suwon’s failure to earn promotion back to K League 1 for a second straight season have been severe. Gone are the general manager, the entire backroom staff — including first-team manager Byun Seung-hwan — and a host of senior players, including Lee Ki-jae.\n\nLee Ki-jae during happier times.\n\nSuwon invested heavily in their squad last winter, recruiting players in virtually every position. However, a terrible start — four points from the first four games — immediately put the club on the back foot. They never recovered sufficiently.\n\nOne of the major weaknesses in the Suwon squad over recent seasons had been their attack. A lack of goals cost the Bluewings their K League 1 status in 2023 and contributed to their dismal sixth-place finish last year. Byun completely overhauled his attacking options, bringing in proven talent — and it worked. Stanislav Iljutcenko, Matheus Serafim, and Kim Ji-hyeon combined for 38 goals as Suwon finished the campaign with an eye-watering total of 76.\n\nUnfortunately, as one gaping hole was repaired, another emerged. The Bluewings were torn apart at the back, conceding 50 goals in 39 matches, and three more against Jeju in the playoffs. These numbers are unsustainable, and what is most frustrating is that over the course of the 39-match regular season, Suwon never rectified the issue. This was compounded by the fact that Suwon fell behind in 19 of their 42 total matches. Only three times did they recover to win. Teams do not earn promotion with such glaring deficiencies.\n\nThe 50-year-old is not a new signing for the club, but the acquisition of the former Gwangju manager is arguably the biggest decision Suwon have made in years. Lee arrives with a stellar reputation as one of the most forward-thinking Korean managers on the circuit.\n\nWill Reis be celebrating for Suwon this season?\n\nWhen Lee signed, the question immediately became: which former Gwangju players would he bring with him? If you conducted a snap poll of Suwon supporters, the name Isnairo Reis Silva Morais would rank highly. The 33-year-old forward scored 10 goals in 32 matches last season and has previously played — and dominated — K League 2.\n\nTwenty-two-year-old goalkeeper Kim Joon-hong joins on a season-long loan from MLS side DC United. Kim arrived in the United States as DC’s first-choice goalkeeper, starting the opening seven matches. Results did not go his way, with the former Jeonbuk youngster conceding 12 goals in three matches before being dropped. DC United were dreadful overall, winning just five matches and finishing with the worst record in the league. Kim will be looking to rebuild his form and confidence at Big Bird. The talent is unquestionably there.\n\nThe saddest aspect of Lee Ki-jae’s departure is not just that his final match ended in defeat, but that it concluded with a scandalous red card. It brought an end to a seven-year association with the Bluewings, during which he earned international caps. Last season, he scored three goals and provided seven assists as Suwon’s first-choice left back. Now, Lee plies his trade in Iran.\n\nPark Hyun-bin will add some much needed steel to Suwon's central midfield.\n\nOther players have arrived with a higher profile under the Lee Jung-hyo revolution, but none will fill such a glaring hole in the lineup as former Bucheon FC midfielder Park Hyun-bin. The combative 22-year-old is exactly what Suwon have lacked for several seasons: a tough, uncompromising, ball-winning central midfielder who finally adds steel to the engine room.\n\nReis and Fessin will supply goals, but Suwon were not short of them last year. What they have craved for some time is a shield protecting their surprisingly fragile defence. Park opted against promotion with Bucheon — where he would have been a guaranteed K League 1 starter — suggesting Suwon made a compelling offer to a potential future Korean international.\n\nIt may sound strange to say this, but 20-year-old right back Lee Geon-hee might not start the season as Suwon’s first-choice option. He fought off competition from experienced former Incheon United defender Jeong Dong-yoon to make 27 appearances in an unstable back line last season.\n\nLee did enough to earn call-ups to the Korea U23 side, and supporters likely felt he still had room to grow. The club’s signing of Gyeongnam FC right back Lee Jun-jae has added depth to the position. Lee Geon-hee was less culpable than most of his senior defensive partners for Suwon’s defensive failures and offered a genuine threat marauding down the right flank.\n\nIs Lee Jung-hyo the man to awaken the giant?\n\nSuwon Bluewings stand on the precipice of becoming a K League 2 staple. This season marks their third year in Korea’s second division — an unthinkable scenario when relegation struck in 2023.\n\nThey responded to the failure to secure an immediate return by investing heavily in an attack that had malfunctioned for years. It still wasn’t enough. Concerns that financial backing would be scaled back have, however, proved unfounded.\n\nSecuring Lee Jung-hyo on a five-year deal was the coup of the winter. The former Busan player came agonisingly close to delivering Gwangju their first major silverware in December and soon after guided the club to the ACL Elite quarter-finals. Now, he is preparing for trips to Paju Frontier and Ansan Greeners.\n\nSuwon have placed all their eggs in this — admittedly impressive — basket. Lee is the best manager in Korea. He has a strong squad and incredible support behind him. If he cannot deliver promotion, it is difficult to imagine who can.\n\nEverything fun about Suwon Samsung Bluewings happens off the pitch — unless you are a rival supporter. The club averaged 12,048 spectators in 2025, their highest figure in a decade. Big Bird is a stunning stadium, and attending a match there remains one of the best football experiences in Korea.\n\nThe Big Bird atmosphere is one of Korea's best.\n\nDespite recent disappointments, those attendance figures are unlikely to dip, largely due to the excitement surrounding Lee Jung-hyo’s arrival. If the former Gwangju manager can get a tune out of his band, this could be a fascinating season to watch unfold.",

    "fullText": "While the Houston Texans sat at home watching as the Seattle Seahawks bested the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX, players from H-Town could at least watch former players try to win a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nLast season, the Texans traded a haul to the Buffalo Bills for Pro Bowl wideout Stefon Diggs. He only played in eight games before a torn ACL sent him to the injured reserve, but he seemed to be well respected among those in the locker room.\n\nWhile he impressed during the regular season as Drake Maye's No. 1 weapon, Diggs struggled to make an impact in the passing game during his first Super Bowl appearance, totaling three catches for 37 yards, including a 26-yard reception late in the fourth quarter to set up a Maye touchdown pass.\n\nOutside of Diggs, no other former Texans player offered much in a 29-13 finish. Here's how every former Houston player performed in the big game out west.\n\nOutside of a few starts during the regular season, Jones, who played with the Texans in the 2023, mostly served as a backup role in the playoffs and only saw action in two snaps in his first Super Bowl appearance.\n\nAkers, a surprise addition to the active roster in 2024 and even started for the Texans with Joe Mixon sidelined, was elevated from Seattle's practice squad for the NFC championship game and Super Bowl in place of the injured Zach Charbonnet. He didn’t record a carry but did get to see the field on special teams.\n\nSaubert, who briefly spent time on the Texans' roster in 2023, totaled four catches for Seattle during the regular season and didn’t see much action in the Super Bowl. He did see action on special teams, mostly kickoffs, field goals and PATs, which was key for kicker Jason Myers in the team's victory.\n\nAustin, a member of the Texans' 2023 practice squad, did see some action on both defense and special teams later in the game. He did not record a stat in his limited reps.\n\nGriffin barely spent a season with the Texans as a part-time starter in 2023, but he's bounced around the league since being drafted in 2017 by Seattle out of Central Florida. Signing back with the franchise this offseason, Griffin didn’t earn an elevation from the team's practice squad in the playoffs and watched from the sidelines as his franchise finally hoisted a Lombardi Trophy.\n\nIf this marks the end of his career, at least he can say he earned a ring.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Texans Wire: How did every former Texans player perform in Super Bowl LX?",

    "description": "Boston Celtics star Jayson Tatum suffered an Achilles tendon tear May 12 during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. Here's the latest update.",
    "fullText": "The Boston Celtics just made an announcement their fans have been eager to hear.\n\nThe franchise said star forward Jayson Tatum, who suffered a torn Achilles tendon in May, was assigned to participate in portions of a G League practice Monday, Feb. 9. Following that session, the Celtics will recall Tatum, where he’ll continue his rehab with the team.\n\nThe Celtics said they would issue future updates when appropriate.\n\nTatum, 27, had suffered the injury during Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the New York Knicks, but has remained a steady presence around the team through its first 53 games of the season.\n\nThe announcement doesn’t necessarily mean Tatum will return to game action imminently, but it does carry significant implications.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about Jayson Tatum’s recovery from his Achilles tendon rupture:\n\nDoes this mean Tatum will absolutely return at some point during the 2025-26 season? Not necessarily. Is it a positive sign? Yes, overwhelmingly so.\n\nAchilles tendon ruptures are complicated injuries that require calculated and arduous rehabs. That Tatum has progressed to the point of limited participation in practice signals that he has advanced to a certain level of competence.\n\nIn September, Tatum told USA TODAY Sports that he hadn’t fully ruled out a return to the court for the 2025-26 season, so this aggressive timeline indicates that Tatum and the Celtics may be considering a pathway toward a return.\n\nTo be sure: the practices will be controlled and the franchise will push Tatum only as far as he’s able. And even then, they will exercise prudence and will closely monitor how he responds to the sessions.\n\nBut, if Tatum is to return this season, he’d eventually need to return to practice and a return this soon should build optimism.\n\nStill, there will be plenty of work left to do for Tatum, and the most challenging part of his recovery will almost certainly be mental. After extended absences, players often feel the need to be tentative or cautious out of fear of reaggravating the injury. Tatum may face similar concerns, and he may even feel he’s lost some explosion or speed.\n\nBut even though Achilles ruptures used to be considered career-ending injuries, modern medicine has allowed plenty of players to return to full health and participation after suffering them.\n\nBoston has surpassed expectations and is 34-19, which is currently third in the East. If Tatum is cleared and able to return, he would instantly add a massive boost of scoring, playmaking and rebounding for the Celtics.\n\nIt would also make the Celtics a real threat to win the Eastern Conference\n\nLast season, Tatum averaged 26.8 points, 8.7 rebounds and 6.0 assists per game.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Jayson Tatum injury update: Latest on Celtics star",

    "fullText": "The national high school boys basketball 2025-26 season is entering postseason mode as many states begin the playoff portion of their campaign.\n\nThe latest set of Top 25 National high school boys basketball rankings is a new No. 1 in Sierra Canyon (Calif.) as they edge out SPIRE Academy (OH). What other programs should be are under consideration as among the top high school boys basketball squads in the land in our tenth set of rankings?\n\nNational high school boys basketball teams now eye the road to the state playoffs and mythical national championship as the 2025-26 season starts heading down that path into the February.\n\nThe Massey Ratings, officially used during the BCS era, is a model that ranks sports teams by analyzing game outcomes, strength of schedule, and margin of victory as of Feb. 9.\n\nSince losing to Bishop McNamara back on Dec. 6, the Sierra Canyon Trailblazers (22-1) have been on a roll, winning 16 straight games and are the hottest high school boys basketball team currently. Sierra Canyon is as good as they come in the country as they feature 5-Star+ Brandon McCoy at combo guard along with 2027 four-star small forward Maximo Adams (North Carolina commitment). After the Hoophall Classic, the Trailblazers returned back to the Golden State and defeated one of the state’s best teams in Harvard-Westlake, 55-47. Sierra Canyon’s most recent win was a 103-74 rout of Loyola last week as they collected win No. 22 on the season.\n\nEasily considered one of the best high school boys basketball teams in the country is SPIRE Academy (18-2), under the direction of the one of the best coaches in the country in Kevin Boyle, drops down from No. 1 for the first time in nearly a month. SPIRE Academy has one of the top rosters in the entire country as they feature the likes of four-star combo guard King Gibson and four-star small forward Alex Constanza (Georgetown commit). SPIRE Academy looks to bounce back after a loss to nationally ranked Montverde Academy (Fla.) and the next time they’ll likely get to do that is on Feb. 21 versus Long Island Lutheran (NY).\n\nDynamic Prep (13-1) are led by former NBA star forward Jermaine O’Neal and are one of the premier destinations for top prep boys basketball programs and top prospects. Last week Dynamic Prep took on nationally ranked Prolific Prep (Fla.), defeating The Crew, 78-66. The team features several of the country’s top players in 2027 four-star small forward Marcus Spears Jr. and 2026 four-star shooting guard Dakari Spear, who this past summer with Drive Nation on the EYBL Circuit, averaged 13.6 points, 3.6 rebounds, and 1.7 assists per game. Dynamic Prep have picked up impressive wins throughout the season with impressive victories against No. 7 Columbus, No. 10 Montverde Academy and a very good Zephyrhills Christian Academy team, respectively.\n\nPaul VI Catholic Panthers (22-2) gets out of the fifth spot and moves up a notch in our latest set of Top 25 rankings. This team has played well all season long behind the ultra-competitive play of 2026 five-star shooting guard Jordan Smith Jr. as they have won 23 games through 25 appearances. The Panthers have been very impressive as among the twenty wins are highlighted victories over teams like Archbishop Stepinac (N.Y.), Father Judge (Pa.) and Calvary Christian Academy (Fla.), respectively. Leading the way out of the backcourt for the Panthers is Smith Jr. and 2027 three-star combo guard Troy Tomlin. Lone losses of the season thus far for Paul VI Catholic came against Prolific Prep and Calvary Christian Academy.\n\nThe Indiana high school boys basketball season has seen the Fishers Tigers (20-0) look every bit of being the best team in the Hoosier State so far through 20 games. Wins have come over Ben Davis, Mt Vernon,  Noblesville, Terre Haute North Vigo and Tech thus far as Fishers starts to head into the tougher portion of their regular season schedule in the early going. The Tigers will be tested in the coming days and weeks in contests versus state-ranked Crown Point and Hamilton Southeastern. Leading the way for Fishers is that of combo guards Carsen Eloms (Wisconsin commit) and Gage Sturgill. Fishers will be tested in the coming days versus Penn and Westfield, respectively.\n\n6. Link Academy (MO) (16-2)\n7. Montverde Academy (Fla.) (15-4)\n8. Prolific Prep (Fla.) (23-4)\n9. Sunnyslope (Ariz.) (22-1) \n10. Compass Prep (Ariz.) (12-4)\n\n11. Wisconsin Lutheran (WI) (19-0) \n12. Calvary Christian Academy (Fla.) (17-1)\n13. Bella Vista College Preparatory School (Ariz.) (9-3) \n14. Wasatch Academy (UT) (15-3)\n15. Santa Margarita Catholic (Calif.)

(21-7)\n\n21. Harvard-Westlake (Calif.) (21-5) \n22. Notre Dame (Calif.) (19-6) \n23. Timpview (UT) (19-2)\n24. Columbus (Fla.) (19-6)\n25. Archbishop Riordan (Calif.)

    "title": "Is Fiorentina the worst late-game team in Serie A?",
    "description": "All the explanation in the world is worth less than a tenth of the solution, but we’re stuck with the former for now.",
    "fullText": "After coughing up a stoppage time equalizer to Torino on Saturday, Fiorentina’s emotional state is somewhere between crumbling and smoldering. It had looked as if the Viola were going to record their first comeback win of the Serie A season; they’ve conceded first in 13 of 24 league matches in this year, taking a total of 5 points from them. That’s left manager Paolo Vanoli and his squad facing what feels like their 15th consecutive inquest.\n\nI’m just as frustrated as everyone about Fiorentina’s inability to hang on in the dying minutes of a game, not least because this equalizer was so predictable that even I saw it coming. As I often do when I’m sad, I decided to suck as many of the emotions out of my head as possible and turned to the pure, cold realm of numbers, hoping to throttle my sadness with math like a healthy person does. Long story short, I made myself a little table.\n\nI started out wondering if Fiorentina’s conceded more late goals (final 10 minutes and stoppage time) of any team in Serie A this year, but I quickly realized how limited that approach was because it ignored everything else. I decided to include the number of goals teams had scored as well as conceded, as the net value felt more important.\n\nI also decided figure out the rate at which teams conceded late goals. Dividing a 90 minute game into 6 10-minute periods made the most sense. You’d expect teams to concede about 16.67% of their goals in each 10-minute period. Anyways, I grabbed my data and went to my trusty visualizing website. The table’s sortable by any column if you want to play around with it.\n\nMuch to my astonishment, I discovered that Fiorentina isn’t the worst team in Serie A at the end of games by any measure. Hellas Verona and Pisa have both conceded 10 goals in the final 10 minutes, while Fiorentina sits at “just” 9. The percentage of total goals conceded late pulled me up short: the Viola are only 5th-worst, with Verona and Pisa below them, as well as high-flying Roma and Inter Milan? What? That’s wacky.\n\nThe attacking numbers were equally anemic for Vanoli’s boys: just 3 goals scored in the last 10 minutes of games, comprising 11.11% of the total goals conceded. In a truly bizarre statistical quirk, that’s the same as Sassuolo and Udinese while also being considerably higher than both Verona and Roma. Inter, by the way, is blowing everyone else away in late goals, turning this apparent weakness into a strength. In short, the Mastini are for sure the worst late-game team in Serie A, with Fiorentina, Pisa, and Roma jostling for the other two spots on the podium.\n\nOkay, so we’ve determined that Fiorentina isn’t Serie A’s worst late-game team. Let the joy be unconfined, et cetera. The performance in crunch time, though, is obviously a concern and is one of several culprits for the Viola swoon into the relegation places. We’ve got the numbers here to contextualize how dire the situation is but they, like the stars, offer us no solutions.\n\nMuch of it comes down to that squishiest of hard facts: late-game mindset. Against Torino, Fiorentina dominated the second half, scored twice to overturn an undeserved first half deficit, and seemed to be cruising. The only shot the Granata mustered from minutes 46-80 was Saul Coco’s speculative blast from 30-odd yards. Clearly the Viola defense had bottled up the visitors: Torino had 3 touches in the Viola penalty area and none were threatening.\n\nRight around the 80 minute mark, though, Vanoli lost his nerve. He knew that Marco Baroni’s guys, seeing every opportunity to get something from a fragile opponent, would throw everything forward, and the Viola mister wasn’t sure his guys could weather the storm. To help, he brought on Luca Ranieri for Manor Solomon, adding an out-of-form defender for the winger who’d scored one of Fiorentina’s goals and had a hand in the other. Roberto Piccoli also replaced Moise Kean.\n\nIt’s obviously much easier to say this in hindsight but that was a massive error for three reasons. First, Torino no longer had to worry about Solomon and Kean’s pace. That allowed everyone to move up the pitch, safe in the knowledge that there was no counterattack coming. Indeed, Piccoli did some great work late on in beating 2 defenders and getting down the wing but there was nobody with him by the time he reached the end line and it went for a Torino goal kick.\n\nThe second reason was relational. Having defended with a back 4 for 80 minutes and done it quite well (aside from the opening goal), introducing Ranieri to create a back 5 threw everyone off. Torino easily overloaded the wings, forcing Fiorentina’s midfield 3 to shuffle back and forth across the pitch. That eventually created creases like the one Zakaria Aboukhlal found in stoppage time. Sure, Comuzzo shouldn’t have fouled him. But the Moroccan also shouldn’t have had half the pitch to himself and the Ginger Prince, uncertain about the covering defense, opted to bring him down rather than give him a free run.\n\nFinally, Vanoli’s substitutions told his players that they weren’t on the front foot anymore. Fiorentina’s got the mental and emotional strength of a clinically-depressed rutabaga so seeing the team brimming with confidence en route to retaking the lead was a welcome change. That mindset led to a strong second half performance. By dropping deep, the mister essentially told his players, “I don’t believe that you can keep this up so we’ve got to hang on by our fingernails instead.” Confidence isn’t quantifiable but, for a group like this, anything that could damage it has to be weighed carefully.\n\nIt’s easy to fall into the post hoc facto rationalizations, of course. Vanoli’s a smart coach and understands the game and this roster better than any of us. If Torino hadn’t scored, we’d be applauding his sensible parking of the bus. Alternatively, if he hadn’t changed anything and Torino had still equalized, we’d be fuming about his failure to react to the scoreboard in the final moments.\n\nThis is also an overreaction based on a single outcome. The Torino result was uniquely psychically damaging for a number of reasons, not least because it resulted in the 6th and 7th points lost to late goals over the past 10 league outings. To me, the difference is in perceived strength of the opponent. Fiorentina is terrible and Milan isn’t, so losing that game is irritating but also feels like justice. Losing to Hellas Verona, the worst late-game team in Serie A, is an act of god from which nobody is safe.\n\nTorino, though, is historically a club more or less on par with Fiorentina: not big enough to consistently trouble the Champions League places but too good to accept mid-table anonymity. Getting punked by your betters or ambushed by your inferiors stings but not as much as messing up against an equal. That’s the sort of result that forces you to take a long look in the mirror and reassess who you are.",

    "fullText": "Winning a Super Bowl is the highest mark of success for an NFL head coach. Only a small group of active coaches can say they have done it. Some built long careers around steady success. Others reached the top early in their coaching journey. Each of these coaches shaped their teams in a different way. Their titles show strong leadership, smart planning, and the ability to win on the biggest stage. Here is a look at the active Super Bowl-winning head coaches.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LX)\n\nMike Macdonald is the newest coach to join this list. He led the Seattle Seahawks to a Super Bowl LX win in 2026. Seattle defeated the New England Patriots 29-13 to earn its second title in franchise history.\n\nHis defensive game plan was the key to the victory. Seattle’s defense controlled the Patriots’ offense from start to finish. Pressure came from all angles and forced mistakes.\n\nThat championship made Macdonald one of the youngest head coaches to win a Super Bowl. The win also proved his defensive style can work at the highest level. Seattle now looks to build around that success for future seasons.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLVII with Baltimore Ravens)\n\nJohn Harbaugh won his Super Bowl with the Ravens in Super Bowl XLVII. That victory helped define his long career in Baltimore. He became known as a coach who could win with strong defense and smart special teams play.\n\nHis teams stayed competitive through many roster changes. New players came in and old stars moved on. Success continued because Harbaugh adjusted his approach to fit his personnel.\n\nHowever, following a disappointing 2025 regular season, Harbaugh was fired from Balti\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl XLIV)\n\nSean Payton earned his Super Bowl title with the New Orleans Saints in Super Bowl XLIV. His offense stood out for its creativity and balance. Play calling became a major part of his reputation.\n\nLater, he moved to the Denver Broncos to begin a new chapter. Experience gives him an edge in building a culture of discipline and preparation.\n\nOffensive ideas from Payton influenced many coaches around the league. His teams often play with speed and confidence. Denver now relies on that knowledge to return to championship form.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LVI)\n\nSean McVay led the Rams to a title in Super Bowl LVI. He became known for modern offensive design and clear communication with his players.\n\nYouth never slowed him down. Playoff runs became common under his leadership. Los Angeles stayed competitive in a tough division because of his planning and play structure.\n\nEach season shows his ability to adapt. Changes at quarterback and defense never stopped his teams from finding ways to win. Many see him as one of the smartest minds in football today.\n\nSuper Bowl Wins: 1 (Super Bowl LIX)\n\nNick Sirianni reached the top with the Eagles during a time when offense ruled the league. His coaching focused on balance and teamwork.\n\nRoster development became one of his strengths. Young players improved quickly under his system. Veterans also fit well into his plans.\n\nPhiladelphia built a strong identity with him in charge. Toughness and energy defined the team’s style. A Bowl win confirmed his place among the league’s top young coaches.\n\nAndy Reid leads this list with three Super Bowl titles. His record shows long-term excellence and steady results. Kansas City became a powerhouse under his leadership.\n\nOffensive creativity sets him apart. Play designs keep defenses guessing every season. Quarterbacks thrive in his system because it allows freedom and structure at the same time.\n\nYears of playoff success place him among the best in NFL history. Consistency defines his career more than any single season. Few active coaches match his résumé.\n\nActive Super Bowl-winning head coaches represent the highest level of achievement in the NFL. Each one reached the top through different paths. Some relied on defense. Others built great offenses. Experience and adaptability connect them all. Their championships show what strong leadership can do for a team. As seasons continue, these coaches will try to add more titles and strengthen their legacy.\n\nThe post Active Super Bowl winning head coaches in the NFL appeared first on The Big Lead.",

    "fullText": "Jalen Hurts has a different vibe after Eagles’ disappointing run originally appeared on The Sporting News. Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nNobody within the Philadelphia Eagles’ organization will question Jalen Hurts’ motivation to get back on the Super Bowl stage in 2026.\n\nThey’ve been here before. A few years back, Hurts led the Eagles to the Super Bowl and played nearly a perfect game. It didn’t matter in the end, as the Eagles lost to the Kansas City Chiefs.\n\nIn the following year, the Eagles made it to the playoffs and fell out in the first round. But their window wasn’t closed. They bounced back with a deep playoff run, which concluded with a Super Bowl victory over the Chiefs. Hurts was crowned the game’s MVP.\n\nA pattern continued. The Eagles had a near collapse in 2025 after a solid start. When they got to the Wild Card stage, the Eagles didn’t have anything left in the tank. In a game where they were favored to win, the San Francisco 49ers stunned the Eagles in South Philly.\n\nHurts isn’t walking around with a sour reaction. Again, they’ve been here before. According to the AP’s Rob Maaddi, Hurts has had a different vibe lately. One that says he’s confident that all will be well when the next season fires up.\n\n“This was just one interaction with Jalen Hurts but I noticed he had a different vibe this week,” Maaddi said on X. “Teammates noticed it, too. A couple guys told me they haven’t seen him smiling and having fun like he did throughout the Pro Bowl Games. He told me he’s in a good place mentally.”\n\nHurts had what many would consider a down year. The Eagles’ offense as a whole looked out of sorts more often than not. Their struggles in 2025 called for Kevin Patullo’s job.\n\nNext season, Hurts and the Eagles’ offense will get a fresh start, as the unit will feature multiple key changes, including the addition of a new offensive coordinator.\n\nIt’s difficult to predict where Sean Mannion can direct the Eagles’ offense, but Hurts’ high spirits is a sign that he’s optimistic about what’s to come. There’s a lot of pressure weighing on the three-time Pro Bowler to lead the Eagles to bounce back. That doesn’t seem to be fazing him so far.\n\nEagles' plans for A.J.

    "fullText": "Marc Guehi has quickly adapted to life at Manchester City since signing for the club from Crystal Palace during the January transfer window. Guehi has only made three appearances for City since arriving at the club. The England international has quickly settled into his role in Pep Guardiola’s side. Given Guehi’s pedigree as a centre-back, a person, and a leader, there was little doubt that he would make an immediate impact at City. He has done exactly that. Marc Guehi’s performance as Manchester City beat Liverpool 2-1 at Anfield was superb, and listening to Guehi speak after the game, he has quickly adapted to life as a player in Pep Guardiola’s system.\n\nThroughout the full 90 minutes as Manchester City beat Liverpool at Anfield, Marc Guehi, alongside Abdukodir Khusanov and Ruben Dias, put in a superb performance at centre-back. Guehi read the game exceptionally well. He also snuffed out danger exceptionally well when Liverpool pressed in the second half. Guehi isn’t the most physically imposing defender, but he knows how to use his body with his positioning supremely well. This stood out throughout yesterday’s match. Outside of the moment where Guehi picked up a yellow card for pulling back Mo Salah, Guehi almost put in a flawless performance at the back. Guehi’s performance was exceptional in a game City had to win, at a venue they typically don’t play well at.\n\nWhat stood out to me after the game, was Marc Guehi’s comments about what it took from his team to beat Liverpool at Anfield. Guehi said that each Manchester City player had to sacrifice for the team to prosper against Arne Slot’s side. In quotes relayed by CityXtra, Guehi explained: “When you’re trying to win games, especially against tough opposition like Liverpool, that’s the standard. It has to be every single person giving every single bit of energy and effort for their brother next to them, and everyone did that today.”\n\nAs Manchester City has embarked on their rebuild, Pep Guardiola has spoken of the importance of team spirit throughout this season. It is a vital ingredient of what typically makes Pep Guardiola’s sides so great. Team spirit underpins everything that City do. The free-flowing and dominant football that is associated with Pep Guardiola teams comes from strong team spirit. Listening to Marc Guehi speak and watching him play, he has fully embraced this side of this Manchester City team. Guehi is often seen celebrating a great defensive effort from his teammates or an inspired save by Gianluigi Donnarumma. These moments might seem small, but they all form an important part of the team spirit that Pep Guardiola is building with his new-look team.\n\nMarc Guehi looks right at home at Manchester City. The England international has slotted seamlessly into City’s defence. He has also fully embraced the team spirit that City is building. That seems like an underrated aspect of this City team, but it is a vital component of what Pep Guardiola is putting together. It also played a key role in Manchester City’s come-from-behind win over Liverpool.",

    "fullText": "MLB Network’s “The Shredder”, an annual ranking system, chose Los Angeles Dodgers first baseman Freddie Freeman as the best first baseman in MLB.\n\nFreeman has topped the list three years in a row.\n\nFor the third year in a row, Freddie Freeman is the No. 1 first baseman on the #Top10RightNow! pic.twitter.com/kzKjMdrwmW\n\n— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) February 10, 2026\n\nThe Shredder uses past performances, offensive and defensive metrics and MLB Network’s research team’s analysis determine each player’s position on the list.\n\nThe other players listed include the Boston Red Sox’s Willson Contreras, the Chicago Cubs’ Michael Busch, the Baltimore Orioles’ Pete Alonso, the Tampa Bay Rays’ Yandy Diaz, the San Francisco Giants’ Rafael Devers, the Toronto Blue Jays’ Vladimir Guerrero Jr., the Atlanta Braves’ Matt Olson and the Athletics’ Nick Kurtz.\n\nFreeman maintained his spot on the list after yet another fantastic season, grading as well above average in most offensive fields.\n\nhe hit 20 or more home runs for the ninth time in the last 10 seasons, and managed an .800 OPS or higher for the 14th consecutive year. He batted .295 last season, placing third in the NL, and made his fifth consecutive appearance in the All-Star Game.\n\nHaving topped the list last year, it wouldn’t have made sense to move Freeman from the top spot when his numbers improved from 2024. Freeman’s batting average, slugging percentage and OPS all increased from two seasons ago, and he also had more homers and RBIs in the same amount of games.\n\nAs the active hits, runs and RBIs leader, it’s hard to imagine anyone claiming his spot as long as he continues producing at the level he has been.\n\nFanGraphs Depth Charts projects a slight regression from Freeman heading into his 17th season, but believes he’ll match his 24 homers from 2025.\n\nThey project he’ll bat .284 with a .849 OPS, and finish the year with a 135 wRC+.\n\nIf Freeman can maintain these numbers, as he has for most of his career, he’ll surely place towards the top, if not at the top, of the first baseman rankings come next offseason. Freeman surely has bigger things on his mind, though, as the Dodgers are currently in pursuit of their third consecutive World Series title.",

    "fullText": "In the latest act of vandalism against the success of Chelsea, the club have just announced the departure of Paul Green, the Head of Women’s Football for the last 13 years of unprecedented success for the women’s team, building it pretty much from the ground up.\n\nThe club just put out a pretty terse statement given his incredible success and history, just a few paragraphs long, thanking him for his service.\n\nSonia Bompastor on the touchline. (Photo by Justin Setterfield/Getty Images)\n\nWe’re no experts on this side of things, so here are some quotes from people who are experts:\n\n“Paul Green’s exit is a major fork in the road for Chelsea, who are now run by sporting directors without women’s football expertise,” said Tom Garry from the Guardian.\n\n“It’s a seismic loss for Chelsea Women. In years to come, we’ll look back at this a bit like David Gill’s departure from Manchester United men, for example.”\n\nIf you want some context for the David Gill comparison – under him it was Fergie, titles and Champions Leagues. After him it’s been David Moyes, Ruben Amorim and mediocrity. If this move is even half as damaging as that, it’s a total disaster.\n\n“It is hard to have much faith in what the club are going to replace him with. A huge amount of institutional knowledge lost,” wrote Jessy PH from the Observer.\n\nChelsea may have won at the weekend, but the way they conceded from a set piece will have been very frustrating for a lot of people. There is a potential solution to solve our increasing concerns about the defensive side of corners and free kicks.\n\nCole Palmer scored three against Wolves, but one journalist pointed out that it was actually another Blue who had been their outstanding attacker in the game.",

    "fullText": "In what was one of the most entertaining contests of the Serie A campaign, Juventus and Lazio shared the spoils with the final score showing 2-2.\n\nPrior to the 45th-minute mark, had someone offered Maurizio Sarri’s men a draw, they would have probably bitten his hand off. After all, the Biancocelesti were disoriented, outplayed, and suffocating from the pressure posed by the Bianconeri, who by all means should have been in the lead if it wasn’t for their lacklustre finishing.\n\nAnd yet, when the final whistle blew, Lazio were left to rue a golden opportunity to complete the double over their northern rivals, as they had squandered a healthy two-goal lead and conceded a 96th-minute equalizer.\n\nSo here are our three takeaways from a thrilling match that may have appeased the neutral but left both sets of players disgruntled with the lack of points they earned.\n\nWhile Alessio Romagnoli’s departure was delayed, it remains very much on the cards ahead of the upcoming summer, as the unhappy defender is still betrothed to Al-Sadd. But while Sarri had depicted the 31-year-old exit as a major tragedy for the backline, Oliver Provstgaard has once again proved he’s up to the task, putting on a big performance against a top opponent.\n\nWatch: Juventus & Lazio Share the Spoils in Four-Goal Thriller – The Highlights\n\nNeedless to say, the Dane cannot be expected to organize the backline and act as a defensive leader at the age of 22, but he offers a robust presence at the back and is willing to put his body in harm’s way.\n\nIf Mario Gila is also destined to leave, then Lazio should try to pair Provstgaard with an experienced profile who can act as a mentor and help him improve his game, as he has the potential to become one of the best centre-backs in the league.\n\nOn Sunday, Sarri was proven right, as Daniel Maldini was indeed the right choice for the centre-forward role. The 24-year-old had a slow start, but he gradually grew into the match and became a thorn in Gleison Bremer’s side, not to mention picking Manuel Locatelli’s pocket to create an out-of-the-blue opening goal.\n\nDaniel Maldini (Photo by Marco Rosi – SS Lazio/Getty Images)\n\nThe versatile attacker is seemingly capable of leading the line in this sort of contest, with Lazio laying low and harrying their opponents on the counterattack. However, it remains to be seen if he can be as effective against compact defences, when he’d have to go shoulder-to-shoulder in tight spaces against centre-backs.\n\nIt should be remembered that the third-generation player often dropped deep or drifted wide on his debut against Genoa, suggesting he wasn’t entirely comfortable with that role. Nevertheless, Sarri will be keen to round out his skill set and win this bet, as he doesn’t seem to be too fond of Petar Ratkov, who represents a more classic version of a centre-forward.\n\nWhen Sarri proclaimed that Matteo Guendouzi wasn’t properly replaced, he certainly had a valid point. The Lazio head coach switched the left-footed Toma Basic to the right side of the midfield trident to fill the gap, but the Croatian has now sustained an injury that could keep him out for a while.\n\nThis knock served as a massive blow for the Aquile, as the lack of quality options in the middle of the park has been exposed. Fisayo Dele-Bashiru came on for Basic, but the Nigerian’s mediocre display justified Sarri’s reluctance to play him. Reda Belahyane is almost in the same boat, while thrusting Adrian Przyborek in this role could be premature.\n\nPlayer Ratings: Juventus 2-2 Lazio – Maldini Announces His Arrival\n\nSince the start of the season, Sarri had insisted that he only sees Danilo Cataldi and Nicolo Rovella as deep-lying playmakers. But as they say, desperate times require desperate measures, and the Tuscan tactician has certainly been forced into making significantly more bizarre choices throughout this unusual campaign than to combine the two Italian midfielders.\n\nOnce fit, Rovella can be easily considered Lazio’s most skilful midfielder, while Cataldi has arguably been the most reliable this term. Hence, dropping one or the other to the bench while fielding underachievers would be criminal.\n\nOn the other hand, a midfield trident of Kenneth Taylor, Cataldi and Rovella could be Lazio’s best possible option at this stage, regardless of which Regista is switched to the box-to-box role.",

If the fans sing their names, it’s well deserved.”\n\nSpurs take on Newcastle in their next Premier League clash as they look to improve their woeful run of form.\n\nBut Frank says he is confident his players are continuing to fight for him despite their results.\n\n“I haven’t seen one Premier League game that the players don’t want to run and fight,” he said.\n\n“So they need to continue it and keep doing what we believe is the right thing, and then it will turn. I’ve never experienced that it will not turn, so I experience it will turn again.\n\n“We can talk about the bottom of the table, or the top of the table, but it’s about the next game.\n\n“I’m fully, fully focused about that. Because there’s also one thing for sure, if you’re too afraid of achieving whatever you want to achieve, you can’t focus, so you just need to focus on your task and need to focus on the next game and do everything you can to win that.\n\n“It’s probably the most competitive Premier League in the five years I’ve been there. So it just makes it very, very difficult every game.”",

In another sequence, the camera zooms in on a face so slowly, I managed to doze off and wake up again before it had finished.\n\nIt would normally be unwise to mention during an interview that you’d fallen asleep during the director’s movie, but Tsuta laughs it off.\n\n“That’s totally fine,” he says, speaking at the Tokyo office of the film’s distributor.\n\nWith your current subscription plan you can comment on stories.

    "description": "AI language models excel in medical exams – but when real people ask them for advice, collaboration fails.",
    "fullText": "Large language models like GPT-4o are now achieving near-perfect results in medical knowledge tests. They pass the US medical licensing exam, summarize patient records, and can classify symptoms. Health authorities worldwide are therefore examining whether AI chatbots could serve as the first point of contact for patients – a kind of \"new gateway to the healthcare system,\" as stated in a strategy paper by the UK's NHS.\n\nHowever, the study \"Reliability of LLMs as medical assistants for the general public: a randomized preregistered study\" by researchers from the University of Oxford significantly dampens these hopes. The work is published in the journal Nature Medicine, and a pre-print version is available on arXiv. The central finding: the clinical knowledge of the models cannot be transferred to interactions with real people.\n\nFor the randomized, controlled study, the researchers recruited 1298 participants from Great Britain. Each subject was presented with one of ten everyday medical scenarios – such as sudden severe headaches, chest pain during pregnancy, or bloody diarrhea. The task: to assess what illness might be present and whether a doctor's visit, the emergency room, or even an ambulance was necessary.\n\nThe participants were randomly divided into four groups. Three groups had access to one AI model each, which was current at the start of the study – GPT-4o, Llama 3, or Command R+. The control group was allowed to use any aids, such as an internet search.\n\nThe results reveal a remarkable discrepancy. Without human involvement, even the language models, which are no longer current, identified at least one relevant illness in 94.9 percent of cases. When asked for the correct course of action – self-treatment, GP, emergency room, or ambulance – they were correct on average in 56.3 percent of cases.\n\nHowever, as soon as real people queried the models, the values plummeted. Participants with AI support recognized relevant illnesses in only a maximum of 34.5 percent of cases – significantly worse than the control group with 47 percent. When choosing the correct course of action, all groups performed equally: around 43 percent accuracy, regardless of whether a chatbot assisted or not.\n\nThe researchers analyzed the chat logs between users and AI models to understand the causes. They identified two central weaknesses: Firstly, participants often provided incomplete information to the models. Secondly, users did not correctly understand the AI's responses – even though the models named at least one correct diagnosis in 65 to 73 percent of cases, participants did not reliably adopt them.\n\nDr. Anne Reinhardt from LMU Munich sees a fundamental gap here: \"Many people quickly trust AI answers to health questions because they are easily accessible. They also sound very convincing linguistically – even when the content is actually medically completely wrong.\"\n\nThe researchers compared the performance of the models on the MedQA benchmark – a standard test with questions from medical exams – with the results of the user study. In 26 out of 30 cases, the models performed better on multiple-choice questions than in interactions with real people. Even benchmark values of over 80 percent sometimes corresponded to user results below 20 percent.\n\nProf. Ute Schmid from the University of Bamberg critically assesses the high performance of the models \"alone\": \"I find the statement that the performance of the language models is significantly higher 'alone' than with users somewhat misleading. In this case, the queries were likely formulated by individuals with expertise and experience with LLMs.\"\n\nThe experts agree that specialized medical chatbots would need to be designed differently from current all-purpose models. Prof. Kerstin Denecke from the Bern University of Applied Sciences outlines the requirements: \"A medically specialized chatbot would need to provide evidence-based, up-to-date information. Furthermore, it would need to reliably recognize emergencies, consider individual risk factors, and transparently communicate its limitations. It should conduct a structured anamnesis to reliably triage. And it should not be tempted to make a diagnosis.\"\n\nHowever, the hurdles for such use are considerable, according to Denecke: \"Major hurdles are, on the one hand, regulation – depending on the function as a medical device or high-risk AI. On the other hand, there is liability, data protection, and technical integration into care processes.\"\n\nThe conclusion of the Oxford researchers is clear: Before AI systems are deployed in healthcare, they must be tested with real users – not just with exam questions or simulated conversations. Schmid advocates for a differentiated approach: \"Quality-assured chatbots could, for example, be offered through statutory health insurance funds and recommended by general practitioners' offices as a first point of access. However, people should not be forced to use these services.\"\n\nDon't miss any news – Facebook,\n LinkedIn or\n Mastodon.\n\nThis article was originally published in\n\n German.\n\n It was translated with technical assistance and editorially reviewed before publication.",

    "description": "Sciences Po Saint-Germain near Paris trains current French secret agents and potential new recruits.",
    "fullText": "University professor Xavier Crettiez admits that he doesn't know the real names of many of the students on his course.\n\nThis is a highly unusual state of affairs in the world of academia, but Prof Crettiez's work is far from standard.\n\nInstead, he helps train France's spies.\n\n\"I rarely know the intelligence agents' backgrounds when they are sent on the course, and I doubt the names I'm given are genuine anyway,\" he says.\n\nIf you wanted to create a setting for a spy school, then the campus of Sciences Po Saint-Germain on the outskirts of Paris seems a good fit.\n\nWith dour, even gloomy-looking, early 20th Century buildings surrounded by busy, drab roads and large, intimidating metal gates, it has a very discreet feel.\n\nWhere it does stand out is its unique diploma that brings together more typical students in their early 20s, and active members of the French secret services, usually between the ages of 35 and 50.\n\nThe course is called Diplôme sur le Renseignement et les Menaces Globales, which translates as Diploma of Intelligence and Global Threats.\n\nIt was developed by the university in association with the Academie du Renseignement, the training arm of the French secret services.\n\nThis came following a request from French authorities a decade ago. After the 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the government went on a large recruitment drive within the French intelligence agencies.\n\nIt asked Sciences Po, one of France's leading universities, to come up with a new course to both train potential new spies, and provide continuous training for current agents.\n\nLarge French companies were also quick to show an interest, both in getting their security staff onto the course, and snapping up many of the younger graduates.\n\nThe diploma is made up of 120 hours of classwork with modules spread over four months. For external students – the spies and those on placement from businesses – it costs around €5,000 ($5,900; £4,400).\n\nThe core aim of the course is to identify threats wherever they are, and how to track and overcome them. The key topics include the economics of organised crime, Islamic jihadism, business intelligence gathering and political violence.\n\nTo attend one of the classes and speak to the students I had to be vetted first by the French security services. The theme of the lesson I joined was \"intelligence and over-reliance on technology\".\n\nOne of the students I speak to is a man in his 40s who goes by the name Roger. He tells me in very precise, clipped English that he is investment banker. He adds: \"I provide consultancy across west Africa, and I joined the course to provide risk assessments to my clients there.\"\n\nProf Crettiez, who teaches political radicalisation, says there has been a huge expansion in the French secret services in recent years. And that there are now around 20,000 agents in what he called the \"inner circle\".\n\nThis is made up of the DGSE, which looks at matters overseas, and is the French equivalent of the UK's MI6 or the US's CIA. And the DGSI, which focuses on threats within France, like the UK's MI5 or the US's FBI.\n\nBut he says it's not just about terrorism. \"There are the two main security agencies, but also Tracfin an intelligence agency which specialises in money laundering.\n\n\"It is preoccupied with the surge in mafia activity, especially in southern France, including corruption in the public and private sectors mainly due to massive profits in illegal drug trafficking.\"\n\nOther lecturers on the course include a DGSE official once located in Moscow, a former French ambassador to Libya, and a senior official from Tracfin. The head of security at the French energy giant EDF also runs one module.\n\nThe private sector's interest in the diploma is said to be continuing to grow. Big businesses, especially in the defence and aerospace sector, but also French luxury goods firms, are increasingly keen to hire the students as they face relentless cyber-security and spying threats as well as sabotage.\n\nRecently graduates have been snapped up by the French mobile phone operator Orange, aerospace and defence giant Thales, and LVHM, which owns everything from Louis Vuitton and Dior to champagne brands Dom Perignon and Krug.\n\nTwenty eight students are enrolled in this year's class. Six are spies. You can tell who they are, as they are the ones huddled together during class breaks, away from the young students, and not too overwhelmed with joy when I approach them.\n\nWithout saying their exact roles, and with arms crossed, one says the course is considered a fast-track stepping stone for a promotion from the office to field work. Another says he gets fresh ideas being in this academic environment. They signed the day's attendance form with just their first names.\n\nOne of the younger students, Alexandre, 21, says he wanted a deeper understanding of the looming economic war between Europe and China. \"Looking at intelligence gathering from a James Bond viewpoint is not relevant, the job is analysing risk and working out how to counteract it,\" he tells me.\n\nAnother class member, Valentine, also 21, says she was inspired by the popular, fictional French TV spy drama Le Bureau. \"Coming here to discover this world which I didn't know anything about except for the TV series has been a remarkable opportunity, and now I am very keen to join the security services.\"\n\nNearly half of the students in the class are in fact women. And this is a relatively recent development according to one of the lecturers, Sebastien-Yves Laurent, a specialist on technology in spying.\n\n\"Women's interest in intelligence gathering is new,\" he says. \"They are interested because they think it will provide for a better world.\n\n\"And if there is one common thread amongst all these young students it's that they are very patriotic and that is new compared to 20 years ago.\n\nIf you are keen to apply to get on the course, French citizenship is an essential requirement, although some dual citizens are accepted.\n\nYet Prof Crettiez says he has to be wary. \"I regularly get applications from very attractive Israeli and Russian women with amazing CVs. Unsurprisingly they are binned immediately.\"\n\nIn a recent group photo of the class you can immediately tell who the spies are - they had their backs to the camera.\n\nWhile all the students and professional spies I met are trim and athletic, Prof Crettiez is also keen to dispel the myth of James Bond-like adventure.\n\n\"Few new recruits will end up in the field,\" he says. \"Most French intelligence agencies jobs are desk bound.\"",

    "fullText": "A hiker captured what he called an \"unprecedented\" moment at France's Isola 2000 ski resort: a massive pack of wolves calmly walking across a groomed ski slope.\n\n\"[I] have never experienced anything like this,\" he told Nice Matin, as reported by The Connexion.\n\nThe video was recorded on December 7, one day after Isola 2000 opened for the season. With the resort still quiet, the hiker encountered seven wolves walking across a freshly groomed slope.\n\n\"It's very, very rare. I'd never seen one before,\" he said, calling the sight \"a truly wonderful encounter.\"\n\nIsola 2000 sits in southeastern France near the Italian border, surrounded by Mercantour National Park — a protected area where wolf packs are known to roam. Still, sightings near developed areas are unusual.\n\nFrance's Office of Biodiversity reported about 15 wolf packs in the department as of 2023. The sighting also follows news of the country's first black-fur wolf pack in the neighboring Var region, suggesting ongoing shifts in regional wolf populations.\n\nThough peaceful, the encounter highlights how development pressures are compressing wild habitats. As resorts and recreation expand, close animal encounters become more likely.\n\nResearch shows humans and wildlife often cross paths in shared spaces — even unintentionally. Repeated exposure may also reduce animals' natural avoidance of people.\n\nSimilar issues are seen in the U.S., where hikers on popular trails have encountered bears with cubs. At the same time, conservation efforts show promise: in Indonesia, a critically endangered Javan rhino was recently born in a protected area.\n\nWolves are protected under French and European conservation law. Officials monitor packs and promote coexistence strategies, such as preserving corridors and limiting early-season disturbances.\n\nVisitors are urged to respect trail closures, keep their distance from wildlife, and recognize that such sightings increasingly reflect the overlap between human activity and natural ecosystems.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The Meta founder’s donation to Sacramento State will help build “state-of-the-art STEM facilities” and a dedicated AI center.",
    "fullText": "Mark Zuckerberg is going all-in on AI and STEM with his philanthropic efforts. Late last year, he and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan, announced they would shift the majority of the Chan Zuckerberg Institute to biomedical AI research. And late last month, the Meta founder and CEO pledged $50 million to Sacramento State University to fuel state-of-the-art STEM labs and an AI center.\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom unveiled the gift on Jan. 28, tying it to a major redevelopment of three vacant state office buildings on Sacramento’s Capitol Mall into a downtown campus. The gift from Zuckerberg and Meta will fund abatement, demolition, and initial construction of the campus, enabling new student housing alongside new academic spaces, including STEM facilities and an AI center.\n\nMeta’s donation also comes at the heels of an interesting corporate and financial dynamic in California: Billionaires may soon be subject to a one-time 5% tax on their wealth. Many billionaires, including Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, PayPal cofounder Peter Thiel, and Craft Ventures’ David Sacks, have already moved their permanent residences out of state to avoid the tax.\n\nZuckerberg hasn’t made any public statements about the billionaires tax, and is instead doubling down on California investments and legacy.\n\n“These investments will help strengthen our communities and support the next generation of leaders and innovators,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. The Meta CEO also owns a compound of 11 properties in Palo Alto’s Crescent Park neighborhood, valued at more than $110 million. Minutes from his home, Meta has its sprawling 57-acre headquarters campus and also more than 400,000 square feet of office space nearby in Menlo Park.\n\nNewsom said Zuckerberg’s gift allows the Sacramento-based school to continue to build its talent pipeline for tech jobs.\n\nThe donation “[opens] doors for students to succeed and for our communities to prosper,” Newsom said. “Making sure students can actually afford to live where they learn is essential to that work.”\n\nWhile this recent donation comes directly from Meta and Zuckerberg, it also fits into the playbook they recently rewrote. Launched in 2015 with a pledge to give away 99% of their fortune, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative has recently refocused on science, AI, and biomedical research, shifting emphasis away from its initial education and social justice priorities (although they say they’ll continue making other local donations).\n\nIn 2025, Zuckerberg and Chan laid the groundwork to recalibrate their philanthropic organization toward AI-powered biomedical research, with a particular focus on their flagship Biohub network. Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes, aims to “cure or prevent all disease,” according to Zuckerberg and Chan.",

    "fullText": "ISLAMABAD (AP) — Pakistan’s president has warned that the Taliban's government in Afghanistan has created conditions “similar to or worse than” those before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, a sign of rising tensions with Kabul after last week’s mosque attack in Islamabad, which analysts said Monday highlights militants’ reach to the capital.\n\nAsif Ali Zardari made the remarks while thanking the international community for condemning Friday's suicide bombing at a Shiite mosque that killed 31 worshippers and wounded 169. Without directly blaming India, Zardari also said Pakistan’s eastern neighbor was “assisting the Taliban regime and threatening not only Pakistan but regional and global peace.”\n\nIn a statement issued Sunday, Zardari said Pakistan “takes strong exception to the situation in Afghanistan where the Taliban regime has created conditions similar to or worse than pre-9/11, when terror organizations posed threats to global peace.” He added that Pakistan had long maintained terrorism cannot be confronted by any single country in isolation.\n\nThe unusually strong comments were likely to irk Kabul and New Delhi, both of which have condemned the suicide attack claimed by the Islamic State group and have denied any involvement.\n\nThe previous Afghan Taliban government, which ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, had been blamed for sheltering the al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden who was behind the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks that killed more than 3,000 people in the United States. The Afghan Taliban also allowed al-Qaida to operate training camps within Afghanistan, despite international warnings. However, bin Laden was killed during a U.S. commando operation in Pakistan in May 2011.\n\nLast week, Afghanistan’s Defense Ministry and New Delhi, in separate statements, rejected the Pakistani allegations, saying Islamabad had irresponsibly linked them to the attack.\n\nPakistan frequently accuses the Afghan Taliban, who returned to power in August 2021 in Afghanistan, of backing militants including the Pakistani Taliban, known as Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP). Both deny the accusations.\n\nThere was no immediate response from India or Afghanistan to Zardari’s latest allegations, which came after Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi said the bomber involved in the attack was a Pakistani and trained by the IS group in Afghanistan.\n\nNaqvi said security forces had arrested four suspects, including an Afghan national accused of links to the militant group and of helping mastermind the attack. The detainees included the bomber’s mother and brother-in-law, according to officials who said investigations into the attack were still ongoing.\n\nPakistan has not shared full details about the involvement of the bomber’s family, however.\n\nOn Monday, Naqvi received telephone calls from his Italian counterpart Matteo Piantedosi and European Commissioner Magnus Brunner, who condemned the mosque attack. According to a government statement, Naqvi maintained that “Pakistan is a shield for the world against terrorism and emphasized that strong global-level measures are needed today to protect the world from terrorism”.\n\nAsif Durrani, Pakistan’s former special representative for Afghanistan, said Zardari’s warning was “unambiguous: terrorism thrives where it is tolerated, facilitated, or used as a proxy.” He wrote on X that “allowing terrorist groups to operate from Afghan soil and India’s use of proxies to destabilize Pakistan is a dangerous path with grave regional and global consequences.” Durrani added, “Peace demands responsibility, not denial.”\n\nAnother Islamabad-based analyst, Abdullah Khan, said the preliminary findings into the mosque bombing suggest the attack may reflect a pattern seen in some IS attacks involving close family networks. He said the IS affiliates have at times recruited entire families, pointing to past attacks in Pakistan and Indonesia.\n\nAlthough Islamabad has seen fewer attacks than some other regions, Pakistan has experienced a recent rise in militant violence, much of it attributed to Baloch separatist groups and the TTP, which is separate from but allied with Afghanistan’s Taliban.\n\nThe Islamic State’s regional affiliate, a major Taliban rival, has carried out attacks across Afghanistan.",

    "description": "A supercharged neutrino that smashed into our planet in 2023 may have been spit out by an exploding primordial black hole with a \"dark charge.\" If true, this theory could lead to a definitive catalog ...",
    "fullText": "When you buy through links on our articles, Future and its syndication partners may earn a commission.\n\nAn impossibly powerful \"ghost particle\" that recently slammed into Earth may have come from a rare type of exploding black hole, researchers claim.\n\nIf true, the extraordinary event may prove a theory that could upend our understanding of both particle physics and dark matter, the team argues. However, this is just one theory, and there is no direct evidence to confirm that this is indeed what happened.\n\nIn early 2023, researchers at the Cubic Kilometre Neutrino Telescope (KM3NeT) — a massive, newly constructed array of sensors at the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea — detected a neutrino, a ghostly particle that has almost no mass and does not readily interact with most matter.\n\nIn addition to neutrinos' typical weirdness, this specific particle was noteworthy for its unusual intensity. It hit our planet with an estimated energy of up to 220 quadrillion electron volts, which is at least 100 times more powerful than any other neutrino detected to date and around 100,000 times greater than anything observed within human-made particle accelerators, like CERN's Large Hadron Collider.\n\nResearchers were initially unsure what caused this \"impossible\" neutrino to appear. It may have been birthed when a cosmic ray entered Earth's atmosphere, unleashing a cascade of high-energy particles that rained down on the planet's surface. However, its unprecedented power led experts to assume that it must have originated from some high-energy cosmic event that we don't fully understand.\n\nIn the new paper, which has been accepted for publication in the journal Physical Review Letters, one research group believes they have finally identified what really birthed the neutrino: an exploding, primordial black hole (PBH).\n\nPBHs are a hypothetical class of black holes that are extremely small — potentially ranging from the size of an atom to a pinhead — and likely date back to the first moments after the Big Bang. The concept was first popularized by British physicist Stephen Hawking in the early 1970s, who also hinted that these miniature singularities would emit large quantities of high-energy particles, dubbed Hawking radiation, as they slowly evaporated. In theory, this would also mean they have the capacity to explode.\n\n\"The lighter a black hole is, the hotter it should be and the more particles it will emit,\" study co-author Andrea Thamm, a theoretical physicist at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said in a statement. \"As PBHs evaporate, they become ever lighter, and so hotter, emitting even more radiation in a runaway process until explosion.\"\n\nOne of the biggest mysteries surrounding the impossible neutrino, aside from its immense power, is that it was not observed by other neutrino detectors around the world, such as the IceCube Neutrino Observatory buried beneath Antarctica's icy surface. Given that PBHs are supposed to be fairly common throughout the universe, one would reasonably expect that similarly powerful particles also would have been detected before or since this possible discovery, especially as the number of neutrino detectors is quickly increasing.\n\nThe researchers said this is because the neutrino was emitted by a special type of PBH, dubbed a quasi-extremal PBH, which has a \"dark charge\" — a version of regular electric force that includes a very heavy, hypothesized version of the electron dubbed a \"dark electron.\"\n\nThe dark properties of this theoretical type of PBH make it less likely that these black holes' explosions would be detected, the researchers suggested. It may also be that some of the less-powerful neutrinos detected to date may be partially incomplete detections of these events, they added.\n\n\"A PBH with a dark charge has unique properties and behaves in ways that are different from other, simpler PBH models,\" Thamm said. \"We have shown that this can provide an explanation of all of the seemingly inconsistent experimental data.\"\n\nWhile the new research hints at the existence of quasi-extremal PBHs, it does not confirm them or prove that they explode as the researchers think. (Regular PBHs have never been directly observed, either, although there is a strong consensus that they exist.)\n\nHowever, the team is confident that it will not take long to prove these dark explosions are real. The same research group recently predicted that there is a 90% chance we will see the first quasi-extremal PBH blow up by 2035, which would be extremely exciting for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, these explosions would be so powerful that they would probably emit \"a definitive catalog of all the subatomic particles in existence,\" including known entities, like the Higgs boson; theorized particles, like gravitons or time-traveling tachyons; and \"everything else that is, so far, entirely unknown to science,\" the researchers wrote in the statement.\n\n—Atom-size black holes from the dawn of time could be devouring stars from the inside out\n\n—A 'primordial' black hole may zoom through our solar system every decade\n\n—Some objects we thought were planets may actually be tiny black holes from the dawn of time\n\nSecond, these black holes could help reveal the mysterious identity of dark matter — the invisible stuff that we cannot see, yet whose gravitational force we can detect within almost every observed galaxy, including the Milky Way. The researchers wrote that quasi-extremal PBHs \"could constitute all of the observed dark matter in the universe,\" so finding one could help put this mystery to bed. (Despite the similar names, dark matter is not directly related to dark charge or dark electrons.)\n\nThe researchers, along with several other teams in the fields of physics and cosmology, are now holding their collective breath to see when the first explosion might be detected.\n\nThis \"incredible event\" would provide a \"new window on the universe\" and help us \"explain this otherwise unexplainable phenomenon,\" study lead author Michael Baker, a theoretical physicist at UMass Amherst, said in the statement.",

    "fullText": "BAGHDAD (AP) — Iraq announced on Monday that a high-level security officer during the rule of Saddam Hussein has been hanged for his involvement in the 1980 killing of a prominent Shiite cleric.\n\nThe National Security Service said that Saadoun Sabri al-Qaisi, who held the rank of major general under Saddam and was arrested last year, was convicted of “grave crimes against humanity,” including the killing of prominent Iraqi Shiite cleric Mohammed Baqir al-Sadr, members of the al-Hakim family, and other civilians.\n\nThe agency did not say when al-Qaisi was executed.\n\nAl-Sadr was a leading critic of Iraq's secular Baathist government and Saddam, his opposition intensifying following the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, which heightened Saddam’s fears of a Shiite-led uprising in Iraq.\n\nIn 1980, as the government moved against Shiite activists, al-Sadr and his sister Bint al-Huda — a religious scholar and activist who spoke out against government oppression — were arrested. Reports indicate they were tortured before being executed by hanging on April 8, 1980.\n\nThe execution sparked widespread outrage at the time and remains a symbol of repression under Saddam's rule. Saddam was from Iraq's Sunni minority.\n\nSince the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq, authorities have pursued former officials accused of crimes against humanity and abuses against political and religious opponents. Iraq has faced criticism from human rights groups over its application of the death penalty.",

    "title": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show was a perfect artistic statement — except for Lady Gaga's cameo",
    "description": "Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance at Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show on Sunday, singing a salsa-inspired rendition of \"Die With a Smile.\"",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny brought the fiesta to the Super Bowl on Sunday, performing reggaeton hits and paying tribute to his Latino heritage — but for a halftime show rich with symbolism and lovingly curated details, one moment felt curiously out of place.\n\nAbout five minutes into Bad Bunny's performance, Lady Gaga materialized out of the blue to sing a salsa-inspired rendition of \"Die With a Smile,\" her popular duet with Bruno Mars from her latest album, \"Mayhem.\" It was a strange choice that, while entertaining enough, felt out of step with the rest of the Puerto Rican superstar's performance.\n\nFrom the moment Bad Bunny stepped on the field, he made the celebratory themes of his performance clear. His set was about Puerto Rican pride: There were dancers dressed as jíbaros in pavas (farmers in traditional straw hats), vendors selling coco frio and piraguas (chilled coconut and shaved ice), and, of course, his signature blend of party-starting beats and culturally significant lyrics.\n\nThe second song in his set list, \"Yo Perreo Sola,\" is sung from a woman's perspective to protest sexual harassment in clubs, while \"Eoo\" pays tribute to the caseríos (public housing in Puerto Rico) where reggaeton was born and nurtured. It was as much a celebration of Puerto Rican history and culture as it was a spectacle for NFL fans, if not more.\n\nSo, as a viewer, when Gaga appeared, there was no obvious reason for her to be there. She didn't cover one of Bad Bunny's songs, as her fellow guest Ricky Martin did later in the show with \"Lo Que Le Pasó a Hawaii.\" She didn't sing her own beloved song \"Born This Way,\" which would have fit the show's broader themes of unity and acceptance, or even \"Alejandro,\" which incorporates Latin pop production. Instead, she opted for her most recent hit, which had no clear thematic connection (her duet partner, Mars, who has Puerto Rican heritage through his father, was not in attendance).\n\nBecause so much of Bad Bunny's show — from his wardrobe to his props and set design — felt deliberate and carefully planned, Gaga's surprise cameo stuck out even more. It felt as if she were simply filling a gap in the production schedule left open for extra star power.\n\nThis isn't to say Gaga didn't nail her vocals (she always does), or that she had anything but good intentions for accepting Bad Bunny's invitation. The two singers have long expressed respect and admiration for each other; in fact, Bad Bunny is a certified Little Monster. He cited Gaga's music as an entry point for appreciating drag culture, and he gushed over her 2020 album \"Chromatica.\" In 2023, Gaga even introduced Bad Bunny as a musical guest on \"Saturday Night Live.\"\n\nIt could very well be that Bad Bunny asked Gaga to join his Super Bowl performance because he wanted her there, and to that, I have no objection. Still, if they were saving room in the show for randomness and whimsy, she could've at least sung \"Abracadabra.\"",

Musk did not respond to the investigation at the time.\n\n\"The funny part about that clown's analysis is that even if every bit of bullshit he says is true, it still amounts to less than 1% of the value of Tesla and SpaceX,\" Musk responded on X on Sunday, followed by two crying-laughing emojis. \"Where did the other 99% come from?\"\n\nTesla has a market capitalization of around $1.5 trillion. SpaceX is reportedly planning to go public at a similar valuation later this year.\n\nMusk's retort comes at a time of intense scrutiny of the tech billionaire, his companies, and their reliance on government support. Tesla is facing fresh questions over the feasibility of Musk's vision of self-driving cars and humanoid robots as its core auto business continues to slow. Meanwhile, SpaceX has moved to acquire Musk's AI company, xAI.\n\nAlso on Sunday, Musk replied to another user who wrote that Starlink \"already produces massive cash\" and \"Elon doesn't need military money.\"\n\n\"True. I love NASA, but they will only be ~5% of SpaceX revenue this year,\" Musk wrote. \"Vast majority of SpaceX revenue is the commercial Starlink system.\"\n\nThe world's richest man later replied \"yes\" to a post saying the US government contracts with Musk because he's the \"most efficient vendor\" and saves the government money.\n\n\"SpaceX won the NASA contracts by doing a better job for less money,\" Musk said in a X post last July. \"Moving those contracts to other aerospace companies would leave astronauts stranded and taxpayers on the hook for twice as much!\"\n\nNASA relies heavily on SpaceX for transport to the International Space Station and for key elements of its moon-exploration program, Artemis. The Department of Defense taps Musk's rocket company for tasks such as satellite launches.\n\nAs an electric-vehicle manufacturer, Tesla earns regulatory credits that it sells to other automakers so they can comply with emissions standards and other requirements. Revenue from those accounted for about $2 billion last year.\n\nIn recent years, Musk has taken aim at government subsidies, saying that mature companies shouldn't receive them and public funds are better used elsewhere. His Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cut support programs such as renewable energy incentives last year.",

    "description": "YouTuber MrBeast's company is buying the banking app Step as it looks to expand beyond media and chocolate bars and into fintech.",
    "fullText": "YouTube's top creator, MrBeast, is making a leap into fintech by buying a consumer banking app geared toward teens.\n\nHis company, Beast Industries, is acquiring Step, according to a joint announcement sent Monday.\n\nStep, which describes itself as an \"all-in-one\" money app, is a digital banking platform designed to help young people get their financial start. The company offers a mix of services, including savings accounts, a credit-building Visa card that functions similarly to a debit card, and a cash-advance program. Step itself isn't a bank. It offers its banking services via a partnership with FDIC-member Evolve Bank & Trust.\n\n\"Financial health is fundamental to overall wellbeing, yet too many people lack access to the tools and knowledge they need to build financial security,\" Beast Industries CEO Jeff Housenbold said in a statement. \"This acquisition positions us to meet our audiences where they are, with practical, technology-driven solutions that can transform their financial futures for the better.\"\n\nThe companies did not disclose the terms of the deal. Step said in 2022 that it had raised $500 million in equity and debt from institutional investors, including General Catalyst, companies such as Stripe, and individuals like TikTok influencer Charli D'Amelio.\n\nBeast Industries, which was valued at about $5 billion in its latest round of funding, has been looking for new avenues to make money beyond media, including the possibility of launching a mobile phone service down the road.\n\nMrBeast's candy and chocolate business, Feastables, has been a big money maker for the influencer, pulling in over $200 million in 2024 revenue, according to investor materials viewed by Business Insider. Not all ventures have paid off. The MrBeast team is currently embroiled in a legal battle with a business partner over the operations of its burger business, MrBeast Burger.\n\nThe content creator — who has over 460 million YouTube subscribers — has been planning to break into fintech for months, filing a US trademark application for the name \"MrBeast Financial\" in October. The company teased launching a fintech business with services like student loans, insurance, or credit insights in an early 2025 investor pitch deck, Business Insider first reported. The deck said the company would break into the industry by finding a partner who had existing infrastructure \"while avoiding regulatory, credit risk, and capital requirement.\"\n\nIn January, when Beast Industries announced it raised $200 million from ethereum holding firm Bitmine Immersion Technologies, Housenbold said the company would explore \"ways to further collaborate and incorporate DeFi into our upcoming financial services platform.\"\n\nAs the company prepares to enter the finance business, MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, also said he wants to make videos about finance, such as \"educating people on investing and showing them what is a Roth IRA.\"\n\nDonaldson, who has spoken on many occasions about his personal finances, said in a Monday post on X (formerly Twitter) that he saw the Step acquisition as an opportunity to \"give millions of young people the financial foundation I never had.\"\n\n\"Nobody taught me about investing, building credit, or managing money when I was growing up,\" he wrote.",

    "fullText": "The CEO of Workday is leaving his post, a change that comes less than a week after the software provider laid off about 400 employees.\n\nCarl Eschenbach is being succeeded by Workday cofounder and executive chair Aneel Bhusri, who has held the top job three times before. The company — a software provider for payroll, talent management, and expense processing — said Eschenbach will become a strategic advisor to Bhusri.\n\n\"As we enter a defining moment shaped by AI, there is no one better than Aneel to lead this next chapter,\" said Mark Hawkins, Workday vice chair and lead independent director, in a public statement. \"His vision, conviction, and deep connection to Workday's culture will position the company to continue to lead in a changing landscape.\"\n\nShares of Workday are down roughly 6% today, and down about 43% from a year ago.\n\nBhusri previously served as Workday's co-CEO from 2009 to 2014 with cofounder Dave Duffield. He was also CEO from 2014 to 2020 and co-CEO from 2020 to 2024. Further, Bhusri has been a member of Workday's board since its founding in 2005.\n\nIn announcing the recent layoffs, which affected about 2% of Workday's overall workforce, the company cited a need to realign its resources to meet its top priorities. It didn't blame artificial intelligence as a reason for the cuts.\n\nWorkday also announced a larger round of layoffs last year, citing a need to invest more heavily in strategic areas such as AI. It had more than 20,400 employees as of January 31, 2025.\n\nWorkday was one of many software companies whose share prices took a beating last week following the debut of Anthropic's industry-specific Claude Cowork plugin, which can perform clerical tasks such as tracking compliance. Others included Intuit, Salesforce, and LegalZoom.\n\nLast month in an interview with CNBC, Eschenbach pushed back on the idea that AI advancements would negatively impact Workday.\n\n\"We are uniquely positioned to be one of the AI winners in the enterprise because of our incumbency, and lastly, because of the trust we get from our customers,\" he said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. \"We have the cleanest set of data in the industry, and AI is a tailwind for us.

    "fullText": "It wasn't until my junior year at Stanford University that I first heard about ChatGPT from classmates who'd mentioned they had \"chat\" summarize the class reading.\n\nWhen I asked them what they meant by \"chat,\" they told me all about the AI tool, chatGPT.\n\nI was an English major with a creative writing emphasis during my time at Stanford, so reading and writing were important to my work.\n\nI wanted to ask the students who used ChatGPT to do the reading: Why are you even at Stanford? Why be at any university at all? Isn't the point of pursuing higher education to expand our minds and become better communicators?\n\nAs I progressed through my studies, I would hear ChatGPT mentioned more and more often, with some college professors even adding an AI clause to their syllabi. Some instructors would allow students to use ChatGPT for assistance (a murky definition) while others wouldn't allow it at all.\n\nI refused to use the AI tool in any way.\n\nI didn't care if instructors allowed students to use ChatGPT. I deliberately chose not to use it at all.\n\nSure, studying and studying literature in particular was difficult, but this was why I'd chosen the major; it was challenging, and I wanted to become better with words.\n\nI chose to become an English major because I wanted to improve my writing. I lacked confidence in my writing because I didn't know how to use words when I first entered college. I didn't have that finesse.\n\nApart from wanting to become a better writer, I also wanted to defend my opinions and thoughts with flair. I wanted to articulate sentiment precisely and formulate strong arguments. I wanted to write strongly worded emails. I wanted to think and speak freely.\n\nI wouldn't have been able to achieve any of that if I used ChatGPT.\n\nWhenever I'd hear a peer say they just used ChatGPT for their homework assignments, I'd often think about the many deserving students who hadn't been offered a seat at the university — students who, in a heartbeat, would've happily done these assignments themselves.\n\nI had the privilege of studying words at a strong English literature department with so many fine writing instructors. I leaped at opportunities to have my very own work critiqued by great writers. I still can't fathom having \"my\" writing, either partially or entirely synthetic, reviewed by instructors.\n\nAfter all, I was writing in and walking about the same grounds that writing legends once did — writers like bell hooks, John Steinbeck, Karen Zacarías, and David Henry Hwang. With this writing pedigree in mind, I was inspired and motivated to write myself.\n\nNot a day goes by without me putting my English degree to good use. Not a day goes by without me being grateful to my past self for putting in the work to earn the degree herself — without ChatGPT.",

    "description": "Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul would place a lower student-loan limit on certain advanced degrees, including nursing.",
    "fullText": "Nursing programs are taking center stage in the public conversation on President Donald Trump's student-loan repayment overhaul.\n\nPublic comment on the Department of Education's proposed student-loan changes has been open for one week, giving anyone the opportunity to submit feedback. Those changes include new income-driven repayment plans, updates to the handling of defaulted student loans, and new borrowing caps for advanced programs.\n\nThe new borrowing caps, in particular, have sparked conversation and concern among advocates, lawmakers, and students. The department proposed a $100,000 lifetime borrowing limit for graduate students and a $200,000 limit for professional students, and narrowed the programs that would qualify as \"professional\" to 10, including medicine, dentistry, and law.\n\nPost-graduate nursing programs are not included in the professional definition, meaning that students in those programs would not qualify for the higher borrowing limit. Of the over 2,500 public comments received so far, more than 1,200 mentioned nursing. One comment, for example, said: \"During a critical nursing shortage it's vital that nurses are able to advance their education so they can teach the next generation of nurses.\"\n\nAnother comment said: \"Policies that make graduate nursing education less affordable will not only discourage nurses from advancing their education but will also reduce the number of nurse educators available to train the next generation of nurses. Fewer educators mean fewer nursing school slots and longer delays in bringing new nurses into the workforce, and ultimately compromising care.\"\n\nEllen Keast, the department's press secretary for education, previously cited data from the Department of Education showing that 95% of nursing students are borrowing within the student-loan limits when asked about concerns on the borrowing caps.\n\n\"As for the most expensive outlying 5%, enrolled students are grandfathered into current lending limits to ensure there are no barriers to completion,\" Keast said. \"We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.\"\n\nData from the College Scorecard also showed that most advanced nursing programs would not be affected by the proposed caps. Still, many of the comments expressed concern that the caps could exacerbate the existing healthcare shortage. In December, a bipartisan group of over 140 lawmakers sent a letter to Undersecretary of Education Nicholas Kent, urging him to revise the definition of a professional degree to include postgraduate nursing programs.\n\n\"Classifying these programs as graduate programs would result in these students having to take out additional student loans to cover the remainder of their tuition, which will limit the ability for students to complete their advanced degree,\" the lawmakers said. They referred to the Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist program, which can cost over $200,000 — double the proposed cap for the program.\n\nThe public comment period for the repayment proposals ends on March 2. The department said in a press release that it \"may make changes\" to its regulations based on the feedback it receives before moving toward final implementation this summer.",

    "fullText": "While theme park giants such as Disney and Universal have continued to see high visitor numbers in an uncertain economy, many smaller amusement parks and themed hotels in different parts of the world have struggled with rising operational costs, to the point of having to shut down business.\n\nAfter posting a loss of more than $1.2 billion at the end of 2025, Six Flags shared its intention to close more \"underperforming\" locations in its amusement and water park portfolio across North America. A Six Flags park in Maryland had closed down month earlier in November 2025.\n\nAt the start of the new year, the Cartoon Network Hotel serving primarily visitors to the Dutch Wonderland park in central Pennsylvania also shut its doors over a string of financial challenges dating back to the Covid pandemic.\n\nOperating in the British seaside town of Somerset since 1946, Brean Theme Park has become the latest theme park to risk a total shutdown after being assigned liquidators over its financial situation.\n\nThe 80-year-old park was originally a campsite for visitors to the coastline along the Bristol Channel but was expanded into a theme park with rides in the 1970s.\n\nThe park that had become beloved local staple known for its free entry (visitors paid credits for rides they wanted to take) had more than 40 attractions and was preparing to open for the summer season in March when it announced that it was taking \"resolutions for winding-up\" on February 4.\n\nNicholas Stafford of Hazlewoods LLP is the insolvency attorney overseeing the liquidation of Brean in a way that helps creditors and shareholders recoup some of their losses.\n\nAs a former public company, Brean stopped trading at the end of January and, short of a last-minute Hail Mary, will be shuttered forever in the coming weeks. The local notice announcing this decision states that \"the Company be wound up voluntarily.\"\n\nAccording to local reports, visitor numbers dipped significantly during the Covid pandemic, and the theme park was not able to recover from the debt created during that period.\n\nThe closure marks a significant blow to both the Somerset community and vacationers from nearby cities such as Gloucester and Bristol.\n\nThe struggling theme park had been renting land from Unity Holidays, the company also behind parks such as Brean Unity Holidays, Brean Splash, Brean Play, and Brean Gym, reported U.K. outlet Daily Express. Those parks, according to their ownership, will continue to operate in the coming summer.",

    "description": "Bad Bunny joins a long list of musicians, including Taylor Swift and Beyoncé, who have been criticized for progressive themes or sexual lyrics.",
    "fullText": "Bad Bunny's Super Bowl halftime show has drawn criticism from the country's top Republican: Donald Trump said it was \"one of the worst, EVER!\" in a post on Truth Social.\n\nStrong words from the president — but this isn't the first time a musician has drawn ire from right-wing politicians and conservatives.\n\nStars like Lady Gaga, Cardi B, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé, and Bruce Springsteen have riled up conservatives, often over progressive themes or sexual lyrics in their music. Keep reading for a list of notable instances in a loosely reverse-chronological order.\n\nReligious panic and conspiracy theories have plagued Lady Gaga for nearly her entire career. Her flamboyant pop music, avant-garde outfits, and advocacy for gay rights have attracted ire from right-wing organizations like the Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nIn 2010, Gaga urged her fans to ignore the Westboro protesters outside her concerts.\n\n\"Do not interact with them, or try to fight. Do not respond to any of their provocation. Don't waste your words or feelings, no matter what you hear or see,\" she wrote on social media. \"Be inspired to ignore their ignorant message, and feel gratitude in your heart that you are not burdened or addicted to hate, as they are.\"\n\nIn 2012, Christian groups in the Philippines tried to sabotage the Asian leg of Gaga's Born This Way Ball, specifically citing her song \"Judas\" as \"the work of Satan,\" per the Guardian. Her sold-out concert in Jakarta was canceled after authorities withdrew permission for her to perform.\n\nMore recently, Gaga's performance of \"Abracadabra\" at the 2026 Grammy Awards was cast as \"demonic\" and anti-American by conservative viewers online.\n\n\"Rainbowland\" was originally released in 2017 as the third track on Miley Cyrus' sixth album, \"Younger Now.\"\n\nThe song is a celebration of acceptance and individuality; Cyrus, who identifies as pansexual, duets with her godmother about a world \"where we're free to be exactly who we are.\"\n\nBut in 2023, when a first-grade class in Wisconsin wanted to sing \"Rainbowland\" for their spring concert, school administrators axed the plan.\n\nIn a statement provided to Business Insider, school-district superintendent James Sebert said the teacher who suggested the song \"Rainbowland\" checked with the school principal \"to determine if the song would be acceptable to use in a first grade concert.\"\n\nWhen the principal reviewed the song alongside a district policy about \"Controversial Issues in the Classroom,\" they \"determined that the song could be deemed controversial in accordance with the policy,\" the statement said.\n\nLil Nas X's \"Montero (Call Me by Your Name)\" rode a wave of conservative backlash to a No. 1 debut on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nThe song is about \"gay sex,\" in Lil Nas X's own words. He told Genius that he intentionally included some explicit lyrics to help \"normalize\" queer lust in music.\n\nThis angered some parents, who claimed Lil Nas X betrayed children who loved his hit single, \"Old Town Road.\"\n\nThe \"Montero\" music video — which shows Lil Nas X riding a stripper pole down to hell and giving Satan a lap dance — also sparked outrage from conservative pundits and politicians, including Candace Owens, a right-wing media personality, and Kaitlin Bennett, better known online as the Kent State \"gun girl,\" as well as commentators on Fox News.\n\nThe controversy even elicited a response from South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem, who slammed Lil Nas X for promoting the song by releasing a limited line of \"Satan Shoes.\"\n\nRight-wing media personalities had a collective meltdown in 2020 when Cardi B released \"WAP,\" her hit collaboration with Megan Thee Stallion.\n\nThe song delights in filthy wordplay and explicit expressions of lust, with both rappers bragging about their healthy signs of arousal.\n\nConservative talk-show host Ben Shapiro even took the time to read the lyrics of \"WAP\" on his live radio show, declaring, \"This is what feminists fought for.\"\n\nCardi wasn't fazed: \"I can't believe conservatives soo mad about WAP,\" she tweeted, and reposted a collection of fan-made memes about Shapiro reciting her \"vulgar\" lyrics.\n\nMegan told Time she was \"taken aback\" by the backlash: \"Like, why is this your focus right now? If you have an issue with what I'm saying don't listen to it. Tune out, 'cause I didn't ask you to tune in.\"\n\nCardi also responded to the outrage surrounding their rendition of \"WAP\" at the 2021 Grammys, which reportedly drew more than 1,000 complaints to the FCC. Fox News host Tucker Carlson told viewers, \"they're intentionally trying to degrade our culture and hurt our children,\" while Candace Owens called the performance \"a destruction of American values.\"\n\n\"Yaaaayyyyyyy WE MADE FOX NEWS GUYS !!! Wap wap wap,\" Cardi wrote on Twitter.\n\nTaylor Swift became a target for conservative politicians and members of the alt-right when she broke her political silence in 2018, endorsing two Democratic candidates in her home state of Tennessee.\n\nThe following year, Swift built on this momentum with \"You Need to Calm Down,\" a pro-gay song that explicitly advocated for the Equality Act, a bill that would create antidiscrimination regulations for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\nConservative websites like The Daily Signal slammed the song's message, while Kellyanne Conway, then serving as senior counselor to the president, used Swift's own lyrics to mock her activism.\n\nIn recent years, Swift has become a favored target for Trump, who wrote \"I HATE TAYLOR SWIFT!\" on Truth Social after Swift endorsed Kamala Harris for president in 2024.\n\nChildish Gambino's \"This Is America\" became a cultural phenomenon in 2018, praised for its harsh commentaries on gun violence and systemic racism. It went on to win record of the year at the Grammys.\n\nHowever, not all reactions were positive. Run-of-the-mill conservatives called it \"evil garbage\" on social media, while professional conservatives wrote scathing essays about its \"superficial\" lyrics and \"paranoid\" message.\n\nFar-right political commentators like Alex Jones and Gavin McInnes were similarly scandalized, describing the music video as a \"voodoo dance\" and declaring, \"Black violence is a bonfire.\"\n\nFox News pundits were up in arms after Kendrick Lamar's powerful performance of \"Alright\" at the 2015 BET Awards.\n\nThe song features lyrics condemning racism and police brutality (\"We hate po-po / Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho\").\n\n\"This is why I say that hip-hop has done more damage to young African Americans than racism in recent years. This is exactly the wrong message,\" Fox News anchor Geraldo Rivera said.\n\nLamar later responded to Rivera's comments during an interview with TMZ.\n\n\"How can you take a song that's about hope and turn it into hatred?\" he said. \"Hip-hop is not the problem. Our reality is the problem of the situation.\"\n\nThe rapper also sampled the news segment on his 2017 album \"Damn.\"\n\nIn 2010, one year before \"Hannah Montana\" ended, Cyrus released a new single called \"Can't Be Tamed.\"\n\nThe electro-pop song celebrates freedom and self-expression, especially in the face of scrutiny. In the music video, Cyrus plays a caged bird who is gawked at and photographed.\n\nIn response, the Media Research Center issued a statement titled \"The Miley Cyrus Effect: Young Girls Acting Like (Trashy) Adults.\"\n\nThe right-wing group, which describes itself as \"America's media watchdog,\" slammed Cyrus for \"dancing provocatively\" and apparently normalizing \"highly sexualized representations of women.\"\n\n\"I Kissed a Girl\" was released as Katy Perry's official debut single in 2008.\n\nHowever, she had previously released contemporary Christian music under her birth name, Katheryn Hudson.\n\nThe song's queer fantasy inspired a small moral panic from her former audience. Adam Holz of PluggedinOnline — a division of the conservative and anti-gay organization Focus on the Family — condemned the song in an article titled  \"A Tale of Two Katys.\"\n\n\"At the moment, Katy Hudson's flirty and 'dirty' alter ego is in the ascendant. Whether or not she'll ever 'come to her senses' as the Bible says the prodigal son did in Luke 15 remains to be seen,\" Holz wrote.\n\nHe added: \"Katy is indeed living down to a damaging, demeaning stereotype, one that our culture has already branded as 'girls gone wild.' Perhaps one day she'll recall the wisdom of her youth.\"\n\nInstead, as the years went on, \"I Kissed a Girl\" was seen as increasingly problematic on the other side of the aisle. Many progressives have criticized the song for trivializing lesbian relationships and feeding a biphobic narrative.\n\nPerry told Glamour in 2018 that she would change the lyrics if she were to release the song today: \"Lyrically, it has a couple of stereotypes in it. Your mind changes so much in 10 years, and you grow so much.\"\n\n\"Goodbye Earl\" is now known as one of The Chicks' most iconic hits, but when it was released as a single in 2000, some people were alarmed.\n\nThe song, written by Dennis Linde and initially recorded by Sons of the Desert, tells the story of two women named Mary Ann and Wanda, who murder Wanda's abusive husband with poison.\n\n\"The debate centers on whether the record sheds light on the problem of domestic violence or condones a murder by the abuse victim and her friend,\" the Los Angeles Times wrote at the time.\n\nIndeed, many country radio stations refused to play the song.\n\nThe backlash even compelled The Chicks to include a disclaimer in the album's liner notes: \"The Dixie Chicks do not advocate premeditated murder, but do love getting even.\"\n\nThree years later, The Chicks came under fire for criticizing then-President George W. Bush and the Iraq War. Conservative fans began boycotting their music, demanding that radio stations do the same. A group of protesters even bulldozed their CDs.\n\nBruce Springsteen wrote \"American Skin (41 Shots)\" after Amadou Diallo, a 23-year-old Black man, was shot and killed by New York City police in 1999.\n\nThe four officers fired 41 shots after Diallo, who was unarmed, apparently reached for his wallet. They were indicted on charges of second-degree murder and reckless endangerment, but eventually acquitted of all charges.\n\nThe song includes the lyrics, \"You get killed just for living in your American skin.\"\n\nSpringsteen performed \"American Skin\" at Madison Square Garden in 2000, which prompted fury from the NYPD.\n\nAs The New York Times reported, Springsteen was criticized by then-Mayor Giuliani, then-Police Commissioner Howard Safir, and Patrick J. Lynch, then-president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, who urged officers to boycott Springsteen's concerts.\n\nIce-T's hard-rock project Body Count is most famous for their 1992 single \"Cop Killer,\" a protest song about racial profiling and police brutality.\n\nShortly after its release, then-President George H. W. Bush condemned \"sick\" rap songs and other forms of \"filth\" that \"rejoice in standing up against law enforcement.\"\n\n\"It is wrong for any company,\" he said, apparently referring to Ice-T's label Time Warner, \"to issue records that approve of killing a law enforcement officer.\"\n\nVice President Dan Quayle also criticized the song as \"outrageous.\" Senator Al Gore's wife, Tipper Gore, who's partially responsible for \"Parental Advisory\" labels on CDs, wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post that compared Ice-T's rhetoric to Hitler's.\n\n\"As Nasty as They Wanna Be,\" the 1989 album from rap group 2 Live Crew, was banned from sale in southern Florida after a US District Court declared the album \"legally obscene.\"\n\nIn his opinion, U.S. District Judge Jose A. Gonzales Jr. of Fort Lauderdale wrote that 2 Live Crew's lyrics \"are replete with references to female and male genitalia, human sexual excretion, oral-anal contact, fellatio, group sex, specific sexual positions, sado-masochism, the turgid state of the male sexual organ, masturbation, cunnilingus, sexual intercourse, and the sounds of moaning.\"\n\nAs the Washington Post reported, possession of obscene material in Florida was punishable by up to 60 days in jail and a $500 fine. Some record store owners were arrested and convicted for selling the album.\n\nMembers of 2 Live Crew group were also arrested for performing the album in Broward County.\n\nIn 1992, the 11th US Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the ruling on the grounds of artistic value.\n\nN.W.A.'s iconic protest song \"Fuck Tha Police,\" which appeared on their 1988 album \"Straight Outta Compton,\" was so reviled by law enforcement that it elicited rebuke from the Federal Bureau of Investigation.\n\nMilt Ahlerich, assistant director of the FBI's Office of Public Affairs, mailed a letter to the group's label, Priority Records, calling the song \"discouraging and degrading.\"\n\n\"Advocating violence and assault is wrong,\" he wrote, \"and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action.\"\n\nIndeed, many police officers boycotted N.W.A. and refused to provide security for their concerts.\n\nIn 1977, amid Queen Elizabeth II's Silver Jubilee celebrations, the Sex Pistols released a song calling her reign \"the fascist regime.\"\n\nThe anti-monarchist sentiments of \"God Save the Queen\" were immediately condemned by conservatives across the nation, as well as by media companies like the BBC, which instituted a total ban on the song from its radio stations.\n\nLondon Councilor Bernard Brook Partridge, a high-profile Conservative Party politician, described The Sex Pistols as \"the antithesis of humankind\" and said he wished for their \"sudden death.\"\n\nAccording to the Guardian, the band was \"hassled by police and attacked by nationalist thugs.\" Some tabloids even accused them of treason.",

    "description": "Bolt Data and Energy was recently cofounded by Eric Schmidt and raised $150 million. Now it's in talks to have Google anchor Texas campus.",
    "fullText": "Bolt Data and Energy, a data center development firm that was cofounded late last year by former Google CEO Eric Schmidt, is negotiating a deal that would allow it to begin construction on a large data center project it is planning in West Texas.\n\nSchmidt's firm is in discussions with Google, his former employer, according to two people with direct knowledge of the talks. The tech giant, one of the leaders in the race to develop and commercialize artificial intelligence, is considering a commitment of 250 megawatts, according to one of the people. The other person said it was too early to characterize the exact size of the potential transaction because it was still under discussion.\n\nThe sources spoke on the condition of anonymity because the potential transaction is still being arranged and the talks are confidential.\n\n\"We don't comment on rumors,\" a Google spokeswoman told Business Insider, declining to comment further. Google announced last year that it plans to build $40 billion of cloud and AI infrastructure in Texas by 2027.\n\nThe potential deal highlights how Big Tech is racing to secure the power, physical infrastructure, and land needed to fuel AI, even as the costs and financial risks of those bets loom.\n\nIn December, Bolt completed its first funding round, raising $150 million from investors, including $50 million from Texas Pacific Land Corporation, a public company that owns large tracts of land in West Texas. As part of the investment from TPL, Bolt will develop data centers on land in TPL's portfolio.\n\nA presentation detailing Bolt's development plans, shared with Business Insider, said that TPL's land would give it access to abundant power and water for cooling. These commodities have become increasingly strained as data center development has boomed around the country.\n\nThe presentation states that Bolt's development would begin with an \"initial 250 megawatt facility\" and expand in 250-500 megawatt increments into a 5 gigawatt campus.\n\nBolt's plan is one of several large-scale projects that have been envisioned in Texas to cater to the AI race. Fermi, a public company co-founded by former Texas governor and US Energy Secretary Rick Perry, has plans for an 11-gigawatt campus in Amarillo.\n\nIn December, Business Insider revealed that Amazon had pulled back a $150 million cash advance it had pledged as part of a preliminary deal to anchor the project. Fermi's disclosure of the reimbursement of that advance caused its stock to fall by 50%. Fermi's CEO, Toby Neugebauer, told Business Insider that although Amazon had reclaimed its advance, the negotiations for it to take space with Fermi were still ongoing.\n\nMajor bank lenders who extended $38 billion to finance the construction of data center campuses in Shackleford County, Texas, and Port Washington, Wisconsin, for Oracle and OpenAI, meanwhile, have had difficulty selling off pieces of the huge loan to other banks and investors. Those troubles stem, in part, from worries about whether Oracle's credit will be strained by its massive AI spending.\n\nTo help allay concerns, Oracle announced it would raise as much as $50 billion in debt and equity in 2026 to continue to pursue its AI buildout while also maintaining \"a solid investment-grade balance sheet.\"\n\nLast week, Alphabet, Google's parent company, revealed in its fourth-quarter earnings report that it plans to spend between $175 and $185 billion on capital expenditures in 2026, roughly double its outlay in 2025. The spending is being done largely to pay for AI equipment and infrastructure.\n\nA record wave of spending has been announced by big technology companies on AI this year, including Amazon's disclosure during its earnings last week that it would spend $200 billion alone this year.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Meta has an internal prototype of an app for sending disappearing messages — but it isn't testing externally. Yet.",
    "fullText": "Hey Meta, are you also nostalgic for 2016?\n\nAs social media users wax poetic and share throwbacks about the social media heyday of 2016, it seems Meta wants to revive a piece of it.\n\nThe tech giant is working on an internal prototype of a new stand-alone app for sending disappearing photos, a spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider.\n\nYes, that does sound like Snapchat's original premise.\n\nAccording to a screenshot shared by mobile developer Alessandro Paluzzi, who reverse engineers Instagram to reveal prototypes, the app is being called \"Instants.\"\n\n\"Share disappearing photos with friends,\" Paluzzi's rendering says.\n\nThe Meta spokesperson said the stand-alone Instants app is not testing externally.\n\n#Instagram is working on a standalone app for Instants/Quicksnap 👀 pic.twitter.com/d56vOeoGap\n\nInstagram has also been testing a feature called Instants, which was previously called \"Shots,\" with some users of its main app. It has been a limited test available to \"some countries globally,\" the Meta spokesperson said.\n\nThe Instants feature lets Instagram users quickly send disappearing photos in their direct-messaging inbox. Once the photo message is opened, the photo disappears and expires 24 hours after sending, per Instagram's Help Center.\n\nInstants can only be \"sent to followers you follow back,\" the same help page says. The photos cannot be edited.\n\nThis isn't the first time Instagram has rolled out disappearing messaging tools.\n\nIn 2016, Instagram launched tools for disappearing text and photos in its DM product. The platform also introduced \"Vanish Mode\" in 2020, which lets users turn on disappearing messages by swiping up in the DM thread. These features are still live within the Instagram app, but Instants would be a new way to send disappearing content to friends.\n\nA new app from Meta shouldn't come as a surprise. It's rolled out several stand-alone apps in the company's recent history, including Threads, Edits, and Meta AI.\n\nInstagram has been doubling down on ways for friends — which Meta defines as people who mutually follow each other — to interact on the app.\n\nInfluencers, the rise of the creator economy, and advertising have turned Instagram into more of an entertainment platform than a social media platform. Now, people post less frequently to the main feed or stories, and instead, share content directly in DMs with their friends and family.\n\nHead of Instagram Adam Mosseri told Business Insider last year that there's been a \"paradigm shift\" toward more private sharing (like DMs) on the platform.\n\nMeta seems to be looking at Snapchat as a frequent source of inspiration for how people communicate with their closest friends.\n\nDisappearing messages aren't the only way Instagram has imitated Snapchat. Stories, famously, was a clone of Snapchat's highly successful product. Last year, Instagram also launched a social map feature similar to Snapchat's Snap Map.\n\nThere's a reason Snap CEO Evan Spiegel keeps \"VP Product @ Meta\" in his LinkedIn bio.",

    "description": "The recent tech sell-off spooked Wall Street, sparking a rerating of AI stocks. One analyst shares his criteria for picking winners in the AI race.",
    "fullText": "The tech stock sell-off that rattled Wall Street last week served as a reminder to investors that AI hype works both ways, and endless enthusiasm is no longer lifting all boats.\n\nThe dramatic downturn hit software stocks hardest, but it also spilled into the broader tech sector. Major indexes have broadly recovered from last week's sell-off, but investors are still on edge about what could be the next shoe to drop.\n\nAccording to Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman, the sell-off was a \"healthy, overdue rotation and a market demanding receipts.\"\n\n\"Ignore hype and look at growth and constraints,\" he told Business Insider. The analyst also shared some tips for picking AI stocks.\n\nHere is the framework Newman says he's using to spot winners and losers as the AI trade evolves.\n\nNot all companies spending on AI are seeing it pay off. While many on Wall Street chalk this up to the early innings of the emerging tech, companies that are seeing AI drive revenue are ones to look for.\n\n\"Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,\" Newman said.\n\nHe highlights Amazon and Microsoft as examples of AI spending fueling revenue real growth, through the tech giant'' respective cloud businesses, AWS and Azure.\n\nCompanies creating their own silicon chips are better positioned to compete. Capacity constraints control the AI race, with chip demand outpacing supply.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are all working on their own custom AI chips.\n\nNewman highlighted that companies with in-house chips benefit from capacity advantages and vertical integration, which set them up for better margins.\n\nCompanies that have been successful in seeing a return on their AI spending have been largely focused on enterprise offerings. These include the cloud hyper scalers, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Amazon, as well as Palantir, a favorite among retail traders.\n\nSome software companies are seeing enterprise monetization, despite the worries that sparked this week's sell-off. Newman highlights ServiceNow and IBM as \"companies driving agentic AI workflows and token consumption.\"\n\nElon Musk told Tesla investors on the company's most recent earnings call that its humanoid robot, Optimus, could generate up to $10 trillion in long-term revenue.\n\nNewman said that physical AI is the next multi-trillion-dollar market outside of data centers. He called out Amazon and Tesla as companies bringing AI to the physical world.\n\nThe market zeroed in on the software space for good reason, Newman said. \"I don't believe the AI will eat all software, but AI will eat some software,\" he told Business Insider.\n\nThe analyst explained that software companies with data running core business applications can survive in an AI era, but they will have to adapt to meet the needs of enterprise customers who want AI insights to fuel productivity gains.\n\nSome software companies partnering with AI factories include Salesforce and ServiceNow.\n\nAs AI-disruption concerns continue to fuel market skittishness, investors should be wary of companies without a clear narrative for how capex will deliver tangible results.\n\nAnother sign that an AI stock is risky may be that a company is using debt to finance AI infrastructure buildouts. Newman clarified that while debt isn't always a bad thing and can be a way to invest in critical growth, it can make a stock more of a risk-on play.\n\nIn a risk-off environment, Newman told Business Insider that there are a couple of things investors should be watching for.\n\n\"Look at the companies that can really afford to keep investing, for businesses that are going to basically create the cash flow that do it with the least risk.\"",

    "fullText": "West Coast Marines are learning how to operate attack drones in a new training course, part of a broader push to accelerate drone readiness across the force.\n\nThe new fast-paced crash course packs a lot into 15 days, teaching Marines how to fly the drones, handle aerial navigation, and safely prepare and deploy explosive payloads made with C-4.\n\nMarines spend several days on a drone simulator before progressing to cheap, expendable, off-the-shelf drones. From there, students move on to more complex systems, including drones built in-house by instructors and the Marine Corps' Neros Archer drone. Neros received a $17 million contract from the service last year for around 8,000 of its small drones.\n\n\"The simulators allow them to develop the core skills that we can then transition to our smaller drone for them to refine,\" said 1st Lt. Braeden McClain, an infantry officer overseeing the course.\n\nSo far, the course has certified 75 Marines as attack drone operators and hopes to graduate 500 a year. These aren't formal military occupational specialties like the positions tied to larger drone platforms; instead, the focus is on spreading drone training across the force.\n\nMuch of the training focuses on mission execution and safety, McClain told Business Insider. Marines fly drones through makeshift PVC gates, testing flight dexterity and aerial navigation as they guide the aircraft to grid coordinates for a strike. The drills are deliberately team-based, reflecting lessons the Marine Corps has drawn from the war in Ukraine, McClain said.\n\nMarines rotate through multiple roles — pilot, team leader, communications support, and payload preparation — while planning missions in detail, establishing checkpoints, and practicing \"talking on target,\" the process of verbally guiding a drone operator onto an objective. Each role comes with challenges, such as factoring in payload weight, radio frequencies, and wind, among other things.\n\n\"We've noticed that really the issue that most Marines struggle with is not the actual flying of the drone itself; it's kind of some of the more fundamental concepts, like aerial navigation,\" McClain said. \"Most Marines have never flown before, so now having them try to navigate through the air is a bit challenging.\" Having course instructors who were already hobby drone enthusiasts has been a boon, he said.\n\nThe training effort is part of a broader push to get American troops trained on drone operations as quickly as possible, a task that marks a sharp departure from the military's historically slow approach to adopting new technology. In recent months, the Pentagon has prioritized rapid defense modernization and closer collaboration with industry as battlefield lessons from Ukraine highlight how quickly drone warfare is evolving.\n\nLast year, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth issued a memo directing the Pentagon to quickly overhaul drone acquisition and fielding processes in an effort to \"unleash\" US military drone dominance, including a push to field more than $1 billion worth of attack drones through 2028.\n\n\"Our acquisition system is designed to reduce acquisition risk to zero,\" Lt. Gen. Benjamin Watson, who oversees the Marine Corps' Training and Education Command, told reporters at the Modern Day Marine symposium last year. \"We've got to field drones at scale in order to be able to pressurize our training, really to work through some of the real hard problems.\"\n\nThe Marine Corps began authorizing more widespread drone training late last year as part of that Pentagon-wide push, and it is now seeking to add 10,000 drones to its inventory over the coming year.\n\nThe First Marine Division program operates under the broader umbrella of the Corps' lead organization for drone training, the Attack Drone Team headquartered in Quantico, Virginia. The Corps stood the team up last year to help develop standardized training pipelines across the force.\n\n\"Right now, our focus is on rapidly building proficiency by sending Marines to a variety of training courses and increasing hands-on familiarization,\" Maj. Alejandro Tavizon, the headquarters company commander at Weapons Training Battalion, which oversees the Attack Drone Team, said last year. \"Our goal is to ensure they can not only operate these systems effectively but also integrate them seamlessly into a team.\"\n\nThat emphasis on team-based drone employment, and on constantly absorbing battlefield lessons from the war in Ukraine, means the course will have to continuously evolve, something not routinely seen in US military training.\n\nSuch immediate evolution is common in Ukraine though, where drone schools are updating their lessons frequently, as often as every two weeks, to keep up with developments on the battlefield.\n\nShifts in drone warfare have become a cat-and-mouse game, with each new tactic forcing a rapid counter. Radio-frequency drones are now routinely jammed, and that electronic warfare has driven the emergence of fiber-optic drones that are largely resistant to interference.\n\n\"At this rate, we see a significant advancement every three to six months,\" McClain said, describing how quickly tactics and technology are changing. \"Flexibility is definitely the name of the game.\"",

    "fullText": "Major players in the agricultural industry are sounding an economic alarm in a joint letter, according to The New York Times.\n\nA bipartisan group of agriculture industry leaders has called upon the Trump administration and Congress to reverse course on tariffs and other economically restrictive measures. The letter said many of these have increased costs, disrupted market access, blocked access to labor, and stopped important agricultural research. Combined, these effects were deemed catastrophic.\n\n\"Our farmers and ranchers can compete with the world, but they can't compete with the world with a chaotic set of policy circumstances,\" said former chief executive of the National Corn Growers Association, Jon Doggett, per The New York Times.\n\nOther signers included Buzz Mattelin, the previous president of the National Barley Growers Association, and Bart Ruth, the previous president of the American Soybean Association.\n\nDomestic agriculture helps people in the U.S. meet their dietary needs. Collapse of the industry would also create steep economic and cultural loss. The challenges imposed by government policy are compounded by a wildly erratic climate.\n\nExisting and ongoing pollution is trapping heat in the atmosphere, which exacerbates destructive weather trends. This includes floods, droughts, storms, and wildfires, all of which pose existential threats to farmers. These weather shifts have also introduced new opportunities for the proliferation of pests, which could obliterate staple crops.\n\n\"Congress needs to assert itself on behalf of farmers if we are to avoid a widespread collapse of American agriculture and our rural communities,\" said the letter.\n\nThe letter recommended nine actions to alleviate the pressure on American farmers. These included exempting farm inputs from tariffs, supporting more trade agreements, and restoring funding to agricultural research.\n\nWhile institutional action is needed, there are individual actions that can be taken.\n\nAdopting a plant-based diet can ensure cropland is being used efficiently to feed people. Likewise, switching to an EV can cut the demand for ethanol otherwise used in running a traditional car. Ethanol production uses up roughly 40% of America's corn production.\n\nWhat's the most you'd pay per month to put solar panels on your roof if there was no down payment?\n\nI'd only do it if someone else paid for it\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "description": "The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower",
    "fullText": "NEW DELHI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The United States and India have released an interim framework for a trade deal, paving the way for an agreement that would lower tariffs, reconfigure energy ties and deepen economic cooperation ​as both seek to realign global supply chains.\n\nThe India–U.S. joint statement suggested that New Delhi pushed back against Washington's efforts to ‌broadly open its agricultural market. However, India has agreed to lower trade barriers on some farm goods, drawing criticism from farmers and opposition parties.\n\nWHO GAINS FROM INDIA'S DECISION TO ALLOW ‌IMPORTS OF DDGS AND SOYOIL, AND WHO LOSES OUT?\n\nIndia is expected to allow imports of protein-rich distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS), a byproduct of ethanol made from corn and other grains, from the United States, adding to a surplus in the domestic market.\n\nHigher supplies of DDGS could benefit India's nearly $30 billion poultry sector, where feed costs account for around 60-70% of total production expenses, by helping reduce expensive feed purchases.\n\nDomestic oilseed processors and soybean farmers, however, may ⁠lose out if U.S. imports rise.\n\nThere are already ‌surplus supplies of DDGS in India, weakening demand for oilmeals such as soyameal, putting pressure on Indian oilseed prices and prompting farmers to switch from soybean and peanuts to corn and rice, despite New Delhi's push to boost ‍oilseed cultivation and curb imports.\n\nAs supplies of DDGS increase further, India's ethanol producers - already struggling with idle capacity and slowing demand after the country achieved its 20% biofuel blending target - may face lower earnings from DDGS sales in the domestic market.\n\nProspects of duty-free imports of soyoil from the U.S. have raised some concerns in India. ​But, under the current framework, duty-free soyoil imports will be allowed only under a tariff-rate quota, meaning volumes above the quota will face ‌standard tariffs, a move aimed at protecting domestic producers.\n\nWILL DUTY-FREE COTTON IMPORTS AFFECT INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia currently imposes an 11% duty on cotton imports, and allowing duty-free imports from the world's largest exporter of the fiber could put pressure on domestic prices.\n\nHowever, the impact is expected to be limited, as the government has permitted only imports of extra-long staple cotton, and that too under a quota.\n\nAlthough India is the world's second-largest cotton producer, it struggles to meet the textile industry's demand for extra-long staple cotton, which it imports from the U.S., Egypt, Brazil and Australia.\n\nDO CONCESSIONAL IMPORTS OF APPLES ⁠AND DRY FRUITS THREATEN INDIAN FARMERS?\n\nIndia is the world's fifth-largest apple producer, but domestic ​supplies fall short of rising demand, driven by population growth and increasing prosperity.\n\nNew Delhi ​imports around 500,000 metric tons of apples annually from Iran, Turkey, Afghanistan, the U.S. and Chile. Under a trade deal with the U.S., imports will be allowed at a concessional duty of 25% and a minimum import price of 80 ‍rupees per kg, effectively preventing shipments ⁠below 100 rupees per kg and helping protect Indian farmers.\n\nConsumption of dry fruits such as walnuts, almonds and pistachios has also been rising in India. Domestic production of these commodities is limited, so concessional imports are unlikely to affect local farmers.\n\nARE INDIAN FARMERS LIKELY ⁠TO BENEFIT FROM THE TRADE DEAL?\n\nIndian growers of tea, coffee, spices and fruits are set to gain from the trade deal, as the U.S. has granted duty-free access for ‌these products.\n\nThe reduction of import duties on rice to 18% is also expected to support exporters of both premium basmati and ‌non-basmati varieties.",

    "fullText": "\"Look for us on TV!\" I told my parents before my fiancé and I headed to Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, California, for our very first Super Bowl.\n\n\"Oh, we're not going to watch the game,\" they replied. \"But can you text us before Bad Bunny comes on?\"\n\nThis year's Super Bowl halftime show might have been even more anticipated than the Big Game. And after a lackluster performance from the New England Patriots against the Seattle Seahawks, it was clear that the real star of Sunday was Bad Bunny.\n\nHere's what it was like to watch his halftime show from the Super Bowl stands.\n\nWe got a sneak peek at Bad Bunny's set as we watched people wheel out carts with tall tufts of grass, a nod to the sugarcane fields of his native Puerto Rico.\n\nI assumed the extras were going to dance, but they were actually added to accommodate rules for protecting the natural grass at Levi's Stadium.\n\nBruce Rodgers, who has produced the Super Bowl halftime show for the past two decades with his company Tribe Inc., told Wired that the NFL limited how many carts could be wheeled out onto the football field. So the team decided to dress up performers to help re-create the lush greenery of Vega Baja, Bad Bunny's hometown.\n\nAndrew Athias, one of the extras, told Business Insider that the grass costume weighed 40 pounds. He flew to California from the East Coast and spent two weeks in rehearsals to be part of the field cast.\n\n\"I got paid $18.70 per hour for the gig, but I would've done it for free,\" he said.\n\nDraped across every seat in the stadium was a football necklace with a lanyard decorated with Bad Bunny's name.\n\nOur necklaces automatically lit up during the performance, providing the glow you could see during the halftime show telecast.\n\nLa Casita, a major stage piece from Bad Bunny's \"No Me Quiero Ir De Aquí\" residency, arrived at the end zone for the Super Bowl halftime show — just not the one we were behind!\n\nStill, the excitement was palpable as Bad Bunny kicked off his 15-minute performance with \"Tití Me Preguntó.\" One guy in front of me even started FaceTiming his friend, holding the phone so she could watch the entire show.\n\nBad Bunny walked through the tall grass, passing by various set pieces that paid homage to Puerto Rico — including stands selling Coco Frio and piraguas — at the start of his performance.\n\nFrom the stands above, all we could see were the tops of the grass. However, a jumbotron directly across from our seats showed us what fans at home were seeing on their TV screens.\n\nEveryone around me was confused when the jumbotron in front of us kept cutting away from Bad Bunny to show random images, including some leaves and a cityscape.\n\nPeople quickly realized that the screen behind us was still showing the halftime show, so we wondered if the stock images were due to a technical issue.\n\nWhen I rewatched the show at home, I noticed our jumbotron was often visible on camera. I'm not an expert in production design, but I figure the decision might have been made to make it look less distracting in the telecast.\n\nI found out that stars including Cardi B, Alix Earle, Pedro Pascal, and Jessica Alba made a quick surprise cameo during the halftime show, thanks to excited texts from my friends who were watching from home.\n\nLady Gaga was also a total surprise for the fans in the stands, and I just about lost it when she appeared to sing a salsa version of \"Die With a Smile.\"\n\nAlas, I have no pictures of this moment because I was too busy crying tears of joy.\n\nWatching the couple say \"I do\" from the stands was a quick but special part of the show, especially when it was later revealed via ESPN that the couple had originally invited Bad Bunny to their wedding — only for him to invite them to get married during his Super Bowl performance instead.\n\n\"The only thing more powerful than hate is love,\" the sign read, evoking Bad Bunny's statement during his Grammys acceptance speech the week prior.\n\nThe stadium erupted as Bad Bunny began singing \"DTMF,\" his message emblazoned for all to see — no matter where we were sitting.\n\nAs fireworks lit up California's slowly darkening blue sky, I knew I had just watched something historic.",

    "description": "As the Pentagon struggles with financial accountability, the Marines have passed their third audit in a row.",
    "fullText": "The Marine Corps has again done what the rest of the US military has repeatedly failed to do with its finances — account for its money.\n\nThe Corps, the only US military service to pass a clean financial audit, announced its third successful audit on Monday.\n\nThe Department of Defense, which was recently authorized to receive a new annual budget of nearly $840 billion a year and could see a substantial increase to $1.5 trillion under the current Trump administration, has consistently failed to pass an audit since audits became legally required for the military in 2018.\n\nPentagon officials hope the military can get its books in order across the services and pass one by 2028.\n\n\"The Marine Corps' audit process enabled accurate global tracking and reporting of financial transactions, inventory of facilities, equipment and assets, and accounting for taxpayer dollars spent during the last fiscal year,\" read a Marine Corps release, \"The auditors also tested the Marine Corps' network, key business systems, and internal controls.\"\n\nThe result reflects years of effort to modernize financial and logistics systems that have long been siloed across units, making audits agonizingly challenging, said Lt. Gen. James Adams III, the deputy commandant for programs and resources, during a media roundtable. Such bottlenecks have been a long-standing problem across the Defense Department and are a major focus of Pentagon reforms.\n\n\"We want to modernize our systems so they're digitally connected, so that we can do audits in the future that are controls-based,\" said Adams, who is set to depart his position soon to lead the Defense Intelligence Agency.\n\nHistorically, fragmented military networks have made everything from force-wide equipment tracking to financial oversight difficult, requiring tedious manual reconciliations. While the Corps still relies heavily on human review, officials say automation and artificial intelligence are already reducing the burden.\n\n\"Right now, we still take a lot of data and move it onto a macro spreadsheet that our accountants are reviewing, and that's just a lot of work,\" said Edward Gardiner, the assistant deputy commandant for programs and resources. AI tools can help flag discrepancies and pinpoint errors, he said. Officials pointed to one automation system that saved 20,000 hours of painful reconciliation work.\n\nAuditors still found seven \"areas of weakness\" in the audit, a common feature even among organizations with clean audits, though Adams told reporters the Corps has prioritized fixes to those areas that pose the greatest risk to financial accuracy after its audits, rather than trying to eliminate all concerns at once.\n\n\"Passing our third consecutive audit is a direct reflection of who we are as Marines,\" the Corps' commandant, Gen. Eric Smith, said in a statement. \"Discipline, accountability, and stewardship are not administrative tasks; they are part of our warfighting culture.\"",

    "fullText": "Raj Jegannathan, who was once tasked with managing Tesla's sales and service team in North America, announced his departure from the company on Monday.\n\nJegannathan, Tesla's vice president of IT, took over the sales organization shortly after Troy Jones, the former vice president of North America sales and service, left the company in July. During his time on the team, Jegannathan worked to incorporate more AI tools in sales and service team workflows, five people with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider.\n\n\"A comprehensive end-to-end understanding of the business has been essential—enabling the team to harness AI effectively to achieve meaningful outcomes across products and customer support,\" Jegannathan wrote on LinkedIn on Monday.\n\nThe executive, who reported directly to Tesla CEO Elon Musk, left the company over the weekend, a person with knowledge of the issue told Business Insider. Jegannathan has not been active on internal company systems since late January, and he has not worked closely with the sales team for a few months, people with knowledge of the issue said.\n\nPrior to taking over leadership of the sales team, Jegannathan worked in engineering and IT, rather than sales. He has worked at Tesla for over 13 years. Shortly after he took the reins, he became known for responding to sales and service requests on X.\n\nJegannathan has led the company through a tumultuous sales period. Tesla reported in January that its delivery numbers fell for the second year in a row. The carmaker reported a 16% year-over-year decline in deliveries during the quarter. Jegannathan led the sales efforts while Musk worked with the federal government as a part of the Department of Government Efficiency, before the organization was dismantled.\n\nSeveral of Musk's direct reports have left the company over the past year. One of Musk's top lieutenants, Omead Afshar, parted ways with the carmaker in June, and Milan Kovac, the head of Tesla's robotics division, left the company that same month.\n\nTesla and Jegannathan did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider\n\nDo you work for Tesla or have a tip?

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump is threatening to block the opening of the Gordie Howe International Bridge, a long-awaited new border crossing between Windsor, Ontario, and Detroit, Michigan.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump said he would not allow the bridge to open until the US is \"fully compensated for everything we have given them,\" adding that Canada must treat the United States with what he described as \"fairness and respect.\"\n\n\"We will start negotiations, IMMEDIATELY. With all that we have given them, we should own, perhaps, at least one half of this asset,\" Trump added.\n\nThe Gordie Howe International Bridge is expected to be completed in early 2026 and has been under construction since 2018. The $6.4 billion project is entirely funded by Canada's Federal government, and will feature six lanes and a pedestrian and cycling path.\n\nThe University of Windsor's Cross-Border Institute estimated in a 2021 study that the new route will save about 850,000 hours a year for trucks, which would mean billions of dollars in savings over the bridge's lifetime. The study also found that the Windsor-Detroit corridor is the largest pathway for trade between the US and Canada.\n\nTrump's remarks mark the latest escalation in tensions with Canada, a key US trading partner, as the president steps up his criticism of the country.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has threatened to slap a 100% tariff on Canadian goods if Ottawa moves forward with a trade deal with China.\n\nHe also bristled at comments made by Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney at the World Economic Forum in Davos, which were widely seen as an implicit rebuke of Trump's foreign and economic policies. In January, Trump also warned that he could impose a 50% tariff on aircraft manufactured in Canada and revoke certification for newly produced planes.\n\nThe White House and the Ontario Premier's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

    "description": "One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consume...",
    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — One year after the Trump administration took control of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the consumer watchdog has largely retreated from enforcement and regulatory work, changes that consumer advocates and Democrats now estimate have cost Americans at least $19 billion in financial relief.\n\nIn a report provided to The Associated Press ahead of its release by the office of Sen. Elizabeth Warren on Monday, the authors say the CFPB harmed consumers by abandoning major consumer protections, stalling investigation and dismissing a number of lawsuits.\n\n“Trump’s attempt to sideline the CFPB has cost families billions of dollars over the last year alone,” said Warren, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, as well as one of the bureau’s fiercest defenders in Congress.\n\nThe administration and congressional Republicans have argued that the bureau needed to be downsized and reined in because it had grown too large and overreaching.\n\nThe administration assumed control of the CFPB in February 2025 after Rohit Chopra, the bureau’s director under President Joe Biden, resigned, leaving White House budget director Russell Vought as acting director. Since then, few new investigations have been opened, many employees have been ordered not to work and several pending enforcement actions against financial companies have been dropped.\n\nThe White House announced in April that it wanted to reduce the Bureau’s staff from 1,689 positions to 207 positions, but that move has been blocked by courts. Even if the employees’ union does succeed in its lawsuit against Vought, Congress cut the bureau’s budget by roughly half in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act. It’s unlikely that all of those employees will still have their jobs once all litigation is settled.\n\n“The CFPB may still be standing, but it’s essentially on life support,” said Chuck Bell, advocacy program director at Consumer Reports, in a statement. Consumer Reports put out its own data Monday that arrives at similar conclusions as Warren's office.\n\nA spokeswoman for the CFPB did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne form of relief the report said consumers were denied was a limit on overdraft fees, which the Biden CFPB finalized in 2024 but the Republican-led Congress overturned last year. That would have saved consumers $5 billion a year, according to the Bureau’s estimates at the time.\n\nThe bureau also tried to cap the amount of money consumers pay to credit card companies when they pay their bills late. That would have saved Americans roughly $10 billion, according to Bureau estimates when the rule was proposed. The regulation was blocked by a federal court last year, and the bureau, under the control of the Trump administration, decided not to fight the lawsuit in court.\n\nAnother roughly $4 billion in consumer relief would have come from a series of lawsuits or settlements that were dismissed by the bureau under Acting Director Vought. For example, the bureau sued Capital One in January 2025 for $2 billion, days before President Trump was to be sworn into office, alleging that Capital One has misrepresented the interest rate paid on its savings accounts to customers. That lawsuit was dismissed.\n\nThe bureau also sued Early Warning Systems, the company that runs the money transfer service Zelle, in December 2024 for $870 million alleging that the EWS and the banks that operate Zelle were negligent in protecting consumers from fraud and scams. That lawsuit was also dismissed last year.\n\nThere's also been a slowdown in the number of complaints resolved by the bureau as well. The CFPB runs its own consumer complaint database, where a consumer can allege wrongdoing by their bank or financial services company and the bureau will act as intermediary between the consumer and financial company to resolve the complaint. Under the Biden CFPB, roughly half of all consumer complaints were resolved with relief for the consumer, whereas under the Trump CFPB, that figure has dwindled to less than 5%.\n\nThe independent Government Accountability Office made public a separate report Monday outlining its attempts to keep track of the Trump administration’s reorganization and restructuring of the CFPB. The GAO said it received no cooperation from the White House or the bureau, and the GAO needed to rely on mostly public records to produce its report. In a response to the GAO, the CFPB cited ongoing litigation between its employees and management as the primary reason why it could not cooperate.\n\nThe GAO’s report largely matches what has been documented in news reports that the bureau has cancelled dozens of enforcement actions against alleged wrongdoers, unwound rules and regulations that previous bureau management said would protect consumers or bring them financial relief. There have been even rules and regulations enacted during President Trump’s first term that have been targeted by the bureau’s current management.\n\nMark Paoletta, the bureau's chief legal officer and effectively its deputy director under Vought, called the GAO’s report “biased and flawed” in a letter to the agency did not raise any specific issues with its conclusions, other than to say the GAO was working with incomplete information.",

    "fullText": "California still has it over Texas in at least one key way, Elon Musk says: Hiring.\n\nAfter moving the headquarters of SpaceX and Tesla Inc. to Texas in recent years because of politics, he said it’s still easier to recruit employees to work in California. With one exception.\n\n“Austin, it helps,” Musk said — while noting that Tesla still has most of its engineering capacity in California. “Getting engineers to move … I call it the significant other problem.”\n\nThat’s what makes engineering recruiting toughest at Starbase, the remote South Texas outpost where SpaceX is developing its Starship mega-rocket.\n\n“For Starbase that was particularly difficult, since the odds of finding a non-SpaceX job are pretty low,” Musk said. “It’s quite difficult. It’s like a technology monastery thing, remote and mostly dudes.”\n\nSpouses, he said, are often unwilling to relocate to the isolated area.\n\nMusk companies also have operations in Robstown McGregor, Bastrop and elsewhere across the state.\n\nHe disclosed the issues on the Cheeky Pint podcast during a chat in which he also accused tech giant Apple Inc. of trying to poach Tesla’s talent when that company was working on its own self-driving electric car, a project it later scrapped.\n\n“They were carpet bombing Tesla with recruiting calls,” Musk said. He claimed their opening offer would be roughly double the compensation at Tesla, indicating what he referred to as a “Tesla pixie dust” factor, in which other companies assume if they could hire someone from Tesla, the employee would put them on track to success.\n\n“When we had the pixie dust problem, we would get relentlessly recruited from,” Musk said. “Also, Tesla being engineering, especially being primarily in Silicon Valley, it’s easier for people to just… They don’t have to change their life very much. Their commute’s going to be the same.”\n\nREAD NEXT: Elon Musk and Jeffrey Epstein had closer ties than disclosed, newly released files show\n\nJohn Collison, co-founder of Stripe and podcast host, asked Musk how he guards against poachers. Musk said there’s not much that can stop it.\n\nMusk has long been trying to draw tech talent to Texas, with a renewed push after last week’s announcement that SpaceX acquired xAI. Days after giving notice of the plan, Michael Nicolls, vice president of Starlink engineering, said the SpaceX-owned satellite company is hiring for critical engineering roles to develop technologies for AI satellites in space at the company’s facilities in Austin and Seattle.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The general counsel for Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard on Monday warned the attorney for an anonymous government employee not to directly share a top-secret complaint about Gabbard's handling of classified material with members of Congress.\n\nThe letter to attorney Andrew Bakaj is the latest escalation in the back-and-forth accusations over the classified complaint, which alleges that Gabbard withheld top-secret material for political reasons.\n\nTwo inspectors general for the intelligence community reviewed the claim and found that particular allegation did not appear to be credible. Gabbard has denied any wrongdoing and said she did all she could to ensure the report reached Congress.\n\nDemocrats on the House and Senate intelligence committees have blasted Gabbard's office over the handling of the complaint, questioning why it took eight months for it to be sent to select members of Congress as required by law.\n\nHere's what to know about the complaint and the next steps:\n\nWhat is known about the complaint\n\nThe anonymous author of the complaint works for a U.S. intelligence agency and in May filed a report claiming that Gabbard withheld classified information for political reasons. Gabbard oversees the coordination of 18 intelligence agencies.\n\nThe complaint made two allegations, according to a memo sent to lawmakers by the current inspector general, Christopher Fox: The first is that the “distribution of a highly classified intelligence report was restricted for political purposes,” while the second accuses Gabbard's general counsel of failing to report a potential crime to the Justice Department.\n\nIn June, the inspector general at the time, Tamara Johnson, found that the claim Gabbard distributed classified information along political lines did not appear to be credible, Fox said in the memo to lawmakers. Johnson was “unable to assess the apparent credibility” of the accusation about the general counsel’s office, Fox wrote.\n\nThe watchdog said he would have deemed the complaint non-urgent, meaning it never would have been referred to lawmakers.\n\n“If the same or similar matter came before me today, I would likely determine that the allegations do not meet the statutory definition of ‘urgent concern,’” Fox wrote.\n\nThe New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other news outlets reported that the complaint stemmed from a call between two foreign nationals that mentioned someone close to President Donald Trump and was intercepted by the National Security Agency. The news reports, which cited anonymous sources, said the discussion involved Iran and that Gabbard notified the White House personally, while the complaint accused her of blocking the NSA from reporting the interaction to other agencies. The AP could not immediately confirm the reports.\n\nThe NSA declined to offer details about the complaint Monday, saying in a statement that it works closely with the FBI and others to investigate the mishandling or disclosure of classified information.\n\nGabbard's office warns attorney\n\nBakaj, a former CIA officer and an attorney for the person making the complaint, offered to meet with certain lawmakers or their staffs to discuss the allegations and his concerns about Gabbard's review.\n\nODNI's general counsel warned against that in its letter Monday, noting that Bakaj or his client could face criminal charges if they improperly revealed classified material during the briefing.\n\n“The highly classified nature of the underlying complaint increases the risk that you or your client inadvertently or otherwise breaks the law by divulging or mishandling classified information,” the general counsel's office wrote. “You may have other means of appearing in front of Congress, but this is not it.”\n\nBakaj did not immediately respond to questions Monday about the letter.\n\nUnder federal law, intelligence whistleblowers are entitled to ask to refer their complaints directly to key lawmakers even if the inspector general finds them non-credible, so long as they deem the allegations urgent. That determination was made by the original watchdog, but the complaint didn’t reach lawmakers until last week.\n\nCopies of the top-secret complaint were hand-delivered beginning last week to the “Gang of Eight” — a group comprised of the House and Senate leaders from both parties as well as the four top lawmakers on the House and Senate intelligence committees.\n\nAdditional meetings for the remaining members are tentatively set for Wednesday.\n\nDemocrats decry delay as GOP backs Gabbard\n\nSen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the senior Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, said he will push Gabbard for more answers about the underlying complaint and why it took so long to get the report to lawmakers.\n\nThe number of redactions make it hard to evaluate the allegations, he said.\n\n“The fact that this sat out there for six, seven, eight months now and we are only seeing it now, raises huge concerns in and of itself,” Warner said Sunday on CBS' “Face the Nation.”\n\nThe Republicans who lead the intelligence committees are backing Gabbard, making it less likely the panels take further steps to investigate the complaint.\n\n“It seemed like an effort by the president’s critics to undermine him,\" Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, the Senate Intelligence Committee's chairman, wrote Saturday on X.\n\nIntelligence chief responds to critics\n\nGabbard noted in a lengthy social media post Saturday that Johnson was appointed interim inspector general for the intelligence community during President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\nShe included a detailed timeline that she said shows she acted quickly to ensure the complaint reached Congress. Gabbard wrote that she was aware of the complaint in June and believed the investigation had ended after it was found non-credible, only for the inspector general’s office to inform her in December that the complaint had to be reviewed, redacted and sent to members of Congress.\n\n“I took immediate action to provide the security guidance to the Intelligence Community Inspector General who then shared the complaint and referenced intelligence with relevant members of Congress last week,” Gabbard wrote.\n\nShe also accused Warner and the media of trying to use the complaint to smear her name.",

    "fullText": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal judge on Monday blocked a California law from going into effect that would ban federal immigration agents from covering their faces, but they will still be required to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number.\n\nCalifornia became the first state to ban most law enforcement officers from wearing facial coverings under a bill that was signed in September following the summer of high-profile raids by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers in Los Angeles.\n\nThe Trump administration filed a lawsuit in November challenging the laws, arguing that they would threaten the safety of officers who are facing harassment, doxing, and violence and that they violated the constitution because the state is directly regulating the federal government.\n\nJudge Christina Snyder said she issued the initial ruling because the mask ban as it was enacted did not also apply to state law enforcement authorities, discriminating against the federal government. The ruling could have national implications as states grapple with how to deal with federal agents enforcing the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.\n\nIt left open the possibility to future legislation banning federal agents from wearing masks if it applied to all law enforcement agencies, with Snyder writing \"the Court finds that federal officers can perform their federal functions without wearing masks.” The ruling will go into effect Feb. 19.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Gavin Newsom signed the bill in September banning some law enforcement officers from wearing masks, neck gaiters, and other facial coverings. It was slated to go into effect Jan. 1 but was put on hold due to the lawsuit.\n\nIn addition to exempting state law enforcement officers, it made exceptions for undercover agents, protective equipment like N95 respirators or tactical gear, and other situations where not wearing a mask would jeopardize an operation. Snyder sided with the federal government, which argued this exemption was discriminatory against federal agents.\n\nNewsom also signed into law a measure requiring law enforcement to wear clear identification showing their agency and badge number while on the job, which was challenged by the federal government but upheld by the judge.\n\nCalifornia State Sen. Scott Weiner, who proposed the original bill to ban facial coverings, said Monday he would immediately introduce new legislation to include state police in the law.\n\n“ICE and Border Patrol are covering their faces to maximize their terror campaign and to insulate themselves from accountability,” Weiner said in a news release. “We will ensure our mask ban can be enforced.”\n\nAt a Jan. 14 hearing, Snyder repeatedly asked the government’s lawyer, Tiberius Davis, to explain why banning masks would impede the federal law enforcement in carrying out their duties, if officers rarely wore masks prior to 2025.\n\nDavis cited claims by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security that there has been a multifold increase in assaults and threats against federal officers. He also brought up an incident in Los Angeles where three women are being accused of livestreaming while following an ICE agent home and posting the address on Instagram.\n\n“There is real deterrence on the officer’s safety and ability to perform their duties,” Davis said.\n\nCameron Bell, California Department of Justice attorney, challenged his claims, saying there was no concrete evidence that federal agents can’t perform their duties without facial coverings.\n\nBell referenced declarations from U.S citizens who have been detained by federal agents but thought they were being kidnapped.\n\n“It’s obvious why these laws are in the public interest,” Bell said.\n\nThe federal government also argued in legal briefs that allowing California’s legislation could lead other states to be “emboldened to impose similar unconstitutional restraints.”\n\nDavis cited a statement from Newsom in July 2025 during an interview posted online where he discussed the mask ban bill, saying, “It appears that we don’t have the legal authority for federal agents but we do for other law enforcement authorities.”\n\nLos Angeles County supervisors voted in December to enact a local ordinance banning law enforcement from wearing masks that went into effect Jan. 8. However, the sheriff’s department said it would not enforce the ordinance until after the court ruled on the statewide mask ban. The Los Angeles Police Department had also said it wouldn’t enforce the mask ban.",

    "description": "Not cool, YouTube. Not cool.",
    "fullText": "My subscription fatigue is real, but at the end of the day, I do recognize that companies need to make money. If one of them manages to put together a compelling package of features for a reasonable price, I can decide whether or not I find that value worth the money. That's fine. What isn't fine is offering a feature for free for years, and then suddenly deciding to lock it behind a paywall.\n\nIt seems YouTube didn't get that memo. Starting on Saturday, outlets like 9to5Google began reporting that YouTube Music had started to remove the ability to vie lyrics for free users. If you want a full lyrics experience, you'll need to The service hasn't cut these users off cold turkey. According to anecdotal user experiences, YouTube Music is opening lyrics access to free users for five songs per month. Once they play song number six, they'll only have access to the first two lines of each song, as the rest of the lyrics will be blurred out. These users will have to wait until the following month to view another five songs.\n\nThere appears to be no confusion about why the lyrics are blurred out, either. When you switch to the \"Lyrics\" tab on YouTube Music as a free account, a new banner appears, telling you how many views you have remaining. Beneath this, you'll see the option to \"Unlock lyrics with Premium,\" a clear message that, unless you pay up, you only get a limited number of lyrics views. This, apparently, follows a months-long period where YouTube Music tested lyrics as a Premium-only feature.\n\nFor what it's worth, when I tried to see what the current lyrics situation looks like on my free YouTube Music app, the service gave me two weeks of Premium for free, with no option to skip it. That's, um, nice of YouTube, but since I already have an Apple Music subscription, the only real consequence here is that I can't test these new lyrics limitations out.\n\nI don't see the strategy here. Lyrics aren't something I feel people would feel compelled to pay for specifically—but they might be annoyed enough at losing them to look elsewhere. Spotify, for example, offers a full lyrics experience for free users. It was only last week the company added offline lyric downloads for Premium users only, but, even then, that's adding a feature for the subscription tier—not taking away an existing feature from free users.\n\nIt's not just Spotify, either. Other free music streaming services offers lyrics, as well, including Pandora, Amazon Music Free, and Freefy. These are largely radio services, so you may not have as much flexibility as you would have with YouTube Music free—but, hey, you at least have lyrics.\n\nLosing lyrics isn't the end of the world for free YouTube Music users, either. Just about any song's lyrics can be found on the internet. Sometimes, the lyrics show up in a Google search window without you needing to even click a link. Otherwise, sites like Genius and AZLyrics do exist. It's just a bummer YouTube feels the need to gatekeep the in-app experience.",

    "description": "A researcher had free access to messages sent on the app Chat & Ask AI.",
    "fullText": "Have you ever used an application called Chat & Ask AI? If so, there's a good chance your messages were exposed last month. In January, an independent researcher was able to easily access some 300 million messages on the service, according to 404 Media's Emanual Maiberg. The data included chat logs related to all kinds of sensitive topics, from drug use to suicide.\n\nChat & Ask AI, an app offered by the Istanbul-based company Codeway that is available on both Apple and Google app stores, claims to have around 50 million users. The application essentially resells access to large language models from other companies, including OpenAI, Claude, and Google, providing limited free access to its users.\n\nThe problem that lead to the data leak was related to an insecure Google Firebase configuration, a relatively common vulnerability. The researcher was easily able to make himself an \"authenticated\" user, at which point he could read messages from 25 million of the app's users. He reportedly extracted and analyzed around 60,000 messages before reporting the issue to Codeway.\n\nThe good news: The issue was quickly patched. More good news: there have been no reports of these messages leaking to the broader internet. Still, this is yet one more reason to carefully consider the kinds of messages you send AI chatbots. Remember, conversations with AI chatbots aren't private—by their nature, these systems often save your conversations to \"remember\" them later. In the case of a data breach, that could potentially lead to embarrassment, or worse—and using an reseller like Chat & Ask AI to access large language models adds another layer of potential security risks, as this recent leak demonstrates.",

    "title": "You Can Opt Out of Ads on ChatGPT, but It Might Not Be Worth It",
    "description": "You don't have to see ads in ChatGPT, but you'll get less ChatGPT in return.",
    "fullText": "It finally happened. After months of speculation, ChatGPT officially has ads. OpenAI revealed the news on Monday, announcing that ads would roll out in testing for logged-in adult users on Free and Go subscriptions. If you or your organization pays for ChatGPT, such as with a Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise, or Education account, you won't see ads with the bot.\n\nOpenAI says that ads do not have an impact on the answers ChatGPT generates, and that these posts are always clearly separated from ChatGPT's actual responses. In addition, ads are labeled as \"Sponsored.\" That being said, it's not exactly a church-and-state situation here. OpenAI says that it decides which ads to show you based on your current and past chats, as well as your past interactions with ChatGPT ads. If you're asking for help with a dinner recipe, you might get an ad for a meal kit or grocery service.\n\nThe company claims it keeps your chats away from advertisers. The idea, according to the company, is strictly funding-based so that OpenAI can expand ChatGPT access to more users. That's reportedly why ads are starting as a test, not a hardcoded feature: OpenAI says it wants to \"learn, listen, and make sure [it gets] the experience right.\" As such, advertisers don't have access to chats, chat histories, memories, or your personal details. They do have access to aggregate information about ad performance, including views and click metrics.\n\nOpenAI will only show ads to adults. If the service detects that you are under 18, it will block ads from populating in your chats. Ads also will not appear if you're talking to ChatGPT about something related to health, medicine, or politics. You can offer OpenAI feedback on the ads you do see, which should inform the ads you receive in the future. You can also delete your ad data and manage ad personalization, if you want to reset the information OpenAI is using to send you ads.\n\nThe thing is, you don't actually have to deal with ads, even if you use ChatGPT for free. That's not just by upgrading to a paid ChatGPT plan, though OpenAI does suggest that option in its announcement. In addition, OpenAI is offering Free and Go users a dedicated choice to opt out of ads here. There is, of course, a pretty sizable catch: You have to agree to fewer daily free messages with ChatGPT. OpenAI doesn't offer specifics here, so it's not clear how limited the ad-free experience will be. But if you hate ads, or if you simply don't want to see an ad for something irrelevant to your ChatGPT conversation, it's an option.\n\nIf you like that trade-off, here's how to opt out of ads. Open ChatGPT, then head to your profile, which opens your profile's Settings page. Here, scroll down to \"Ads controls,\" then choose \"Change plan to go ad-free.\" Select \"Reduce message limits,\" and ChatGPT will confirm ads are off for your account. You can return to this page at any time to turn ads back on and restore your message limits.\n\nDisclosure: Ziff Davis, Mashable’s parent company, in April 2025 filed a lawsuit against OpenAI, alleging it infringed Ziff Davis copyrights in training and operating its AI systems.",

    "title": "Your Browser's Extensions May Be Reading Your Passwords",
    "description": "Take these steps to mitigate the damage.",
    "fullText": "We should all take common-sense steps to make sure our data stays safe and secure: use strong passwords with our accounts, and never reuse passwords; employ two-factor authentication on any account that offers it; and avoid clicking strange links in emails or text messages. But even when you follow all those rules, your personal data can still be at risk, strictly because the services you rely on aren't following these rules themselves.\n\nResearchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison discovered that a concerning number of browser extensions can access sensitive information that you enter into websites. Think passwords, credit card info, and Social Security numbers.\n\nThe team behind the discovery says they weren't out looking to break a security story. Instead, they were \"messing around with login pages,\" specifically Google login pages, when they found that the sites' HTML source code could see the passwords they entered in plain text. They turned their sights onto other websites—more than 7,000, reportedly—and found that about 15% of them were also storing sensitive information in plain text. That's over 1,000 websites exposing important data.\n\nThat, of course, is not supposed to happen: When you enter sensitive data into a website—say, your password into Google's login page—that site shouldn't see your password at all. In short, the sites confirm your passwords through hashing algorithms—essentially, jumbling your password into a code that can be checked against the code the site stores on their end. They can then confirm you entered the right password without ever exposing the actual text. By storing things like passwords and Social Security numbers in plain text, those sites are exposing that data to anyone in the know.\n\nImportantly, that includes browser extensions. The researchers claim that 17,300 Chrome extensions—or 12.5% of the extensions available for download on Google's browser—have the permissions they need to view this sensitive plain text data. Think about the permissions you ignore when setting up a new extension, including permissions that give extensions full access to see and change what you enter on a webpage. Researchers didn't expose any extensions by name, as the situation is not necessarily the fault of the extensions, but considering the scope, it's possible some of the extensions you use can access sensitive information you enter in certain sites.\n\nAgain, legitimate extensions are not the priority: Instead, it's the risk that a developer will create an extension with the intent of scraping sensitive info stored in plain text. While the researchers claim there are no extensions actively abusing this vulnerability yet, this isn't a theoretical problem. Researchers created an extension from scratch that could pull this user data, uploaded it to the Chrome Web Store, and got it approved. They took it down immediately, but proved it's possible for a hacker to get such a malicious extension on the official store. Even if the hacker didn't make the extension, they could acquire a legitimate extension with an existing user base, adjust the code to take advantage of the vulnerability, and spring the updated extension on unsuspecting users. It happens all the time, and not just on Chrome.\n\nUnfortunately, there's little you can do to prevent these sites from storing your passwords, credit cards, and Social Security numbers in plain text. The hope is, following these discoveries, websites will improve their security and kill the vulnerabilities on their end. But that's on them, not you.\n\nThere are some steps you can take to mitigate the damage, however. First, make sure to limit your use of browser extensions. The fewer extensions you use, the less likely it is you'll use a malicious one. Use only extensions you fully trust, and frequently check in on updates. If the extension changes hands to a new developer, vet that new owner before continuing to use it. You could even disable your extensions when sharing sensitive information with websites. If you need to provide your Social Security number on an official web form, for example, you could disable your extensions to prevent them from reading the data.\n\nYou can also limit the data you share that could stored in plain text. If given the option, use passkeys instead of passwords, as passkeys don't actually use any plain text data that hackers could steal. Similarly, use secure payment systems, such as Apple Pay or Google Pay, which don't actually share your credit card information with the website you're making a payment on. The name of the game is to avoiding typing out your sensitive details unless absolutely necessary—and then, reducing the parties who can see those details.",

    "fullText": "Communications minister Anika Wells points to media reports alleging children can access spaces meant for adults which include explicit sexual content\n\nFollow our Australia news live blog for latest updates\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nReports of child grooming and vile content on popular game service Roblox has “alarmed” the communications minister, Anika Wells, who has demanded the platform explain how it is addressing sexual and self-harm material, and that its PG rating be examined by the Australian Classification Board.\n\nThe eSafety commissioner has also written to the game platform, saying it plans to test the promises it made about keeping children safe online, including disabling chat features and making underage accounts private.\n\n“We remain highly concerned by ongoing reports regarding the exploitation of children on the Roblox service, and exposure to harmful material,” the eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said.\n\nRoblox has come under scrutiny after reports that children can be exposed to inappropriate content on the platform, which allows users to create their own mini-games inside the system.\n\nGuardian Australia published a report last November documenting a week of virtual sexual harassment and violence. While playing as an eight-year-old girl, the reporter was given a sexualised avatar, cyberbullied, aggressively killed, sexually assaulted and shat on – all with parental control settings in place.\n\nSign up: AU Breaking News email\n\nWhile platforms such as Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube and Kick were included in Australia’s under-16s social media ban, gaming sites such as Roblox were not.\n\nWells and her department were investigating other levers to regulate services such as Roblox.\n\nThe minister has written to Roblox requesting an urgent meeting, saying she was “alarmed by reports of children being exposed to graphic and gratuitous user-generated content on the platform, including sexually explicit and suicidal material”.\n\n“Even more disturbing are ongoing reports and concerns about children being approached and groomed by predators, who actively seek to exploit their curiosity and innocence,” she said in the letter.\n\nGuardian Australia understands Roblox has not yet responded to the letter. In a statement on Tuesday, a Roblox spokesperson said it was committed to keeping users safe, saying it had recently rolled out features like age checking systems, and was working with Australian law enforcement to keep users safe.\n\n“We look forward to the opportunity to inform the minister of the steps we take to help keep our community safe. Roblox has robust safety policies and processes to help protect users that go beyond many other platforms, and advanced safeguards that monitor for harmful content and communications,” they said.\n\n“While no system is perfect, our commitment to safety never ends, and we continue to strengthen protections to help keep users safe.”\n\nIn her letter, Wells pointed to media reports alleging children can access spaces on the game meant for adults which include explicit sexual content, and charges laid against a Queensland man accused of grooming hundreds of children on platforms such as Roblox, Fortnite and Snapchat.\n\nWells has also asked the eSafety commissioner about any short-term measures that could be taken, and separately has written to the classification board to ask if Roblox’s PG rating remains appropriate.\n\nIn the letter to Roblox, Wells noted the company had worked with the eSafety commissioner on additional safety measures for children but that issues appeared to continue.\n\n“This is untenable, and these issues are of deep concern to many Australians parents and carers,” she wrote, saying she was keen to hear what Roblox was doing to prevent adults contacting children, and to protect children from inappropriate experiences.\n\nThe eSafety office said it had also written to Roblox last week, saying it planned to test how the platform was complying with commitments such as making under-16s private by default, new tools to prevent adult users from contacting children and restricting chat features. After that testing, eSafety foreshadowed it “may take further action under the Online Safety Act”.\n\n“I welcome the minister for communications’ correspondence and the Australian government’s support on this important issue as we use all of the tools available to us to keep Australian kids safe online,” Inman Grant said.",

    "description": "Super Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at - this is how a thunderous evening in California panned out.",
    "fullText": "A shot at history, a delicious chance for revenge and a half-time show guaranteed to rankle the president.\n\nSuper Bowl 60 had plenty of narratives to go at.\n\nHere's how a thunderous evening in California panned out.\n\nWhen these sides last met in the Super Bowl in 2015, Seattle had the chance to win in the final minute but chose to pass instead of run it in from one yard.\n\nPatriots safety Malcolm Butler famously intercepted and the Seahawks have been stewing on a painful defeat for 11 years.\n\nThose memories will make this comprehensive victory all the sweeter.\n\nThat Seattle team was characterised by its 'Legion of Boom' defence - immensely physical and talented athletes that dominated their opposition all over the field.\n\nThe unit that head coach Mike Macdonald and British defensive coordinator Aden Durde have put together, dubbed 'The Dark Side', has arguably eclipsed even that legendary group.\n\nKeeping the Patriots scoreless for three quarters looked almost humane compared with how they responded when their opponents showed some signs of life.\n\nFollowing New England finally getting a touchdown, the Seahawks intercepted on the next play to kill momentum. Then, on the following drive, Devon Witherspoon forced quarterback Drake Maye into a fumble that led to a defensive touchdown.\n\nWith the third youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl and the prospect of a potential franchise sale for billions of dollars, the future looks bright for the Seahawks.\n\nWhile the defence was dominant, and Super Bowl MVP Kenneth Walker was delivering the best rushing numbers in the event for 28 years, quarterback Sam Darnold was quietly putting together his own effective game.\n\nDrafted third overall by the New York Jets in 2018, Darnold's career plummeted, the nadir a game against the Patriots where he admitted to \"seeing ghosts\" in the face of their pressure.\n\nDiscarded by the Jets and the Carolina Panthers, he was back-up in San Francisco before getting a chance at the Minnesota Vikings. He led them to a 14-3 record last season only to be let go again when they faltered in the play-offs.\n\nPicked up in free agency, and supported by a decent offensive line, Darnold has again proved his talent this season and here, he quietly accumulated yards and avoided turnovers - previously the bane of his career.\n\nForgotten by some, written off by most, Darnold's rise to Super Bowl victory is perhaps the most satisfying storyline of this NFL season.\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to claim second Super Bowl\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures\n\nFor 20 years, the New England Patriots were the dominant force in the NFL, under the tutelage of Bill Belichick and on the arm of the league's most decorated quarterback Tom Brady.\n\nSix-time champions, they sought to go clear of the Pittsburgh Steelers by making it seven in Santa Clara.\n\nMerely being in this event was a remarkable achievement after back-to-back four-win seasons. Former Patriots linebacker Mike Vrabel took the reins last summer and has inspired a dramatic turnaround.\n\nKey to that has been the stellar play of sophomore quarterback Maye, who finished a narrow runner-up in the vote for regular season Most Valuable Player to Matthew Stafford of the Los Angeles Rams.\n\nHoping to make history as the youngest quarterback to win the Super Bowl, Maye was hit six times and instead collected an undesirable record - his 21 sacks in the post-season the worst in NFL history.\n\nAfter only putting up 78 yards of offence through three quarters, he at least found some juice in the final quarter, throwing touchdowns to Mack Hollins and Rhamondre Stevenson.\n\nBut those late scores papered over the cracks as the Patriots were well beaten, and their bid for history put on hold for at least one more year.\n\nAmid protests and scrutiny over the tactics of the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE), the choices for entertainment at the Super Bowl were not well received in the White House.\n\nWhen Puerto Rican artist Bad Bunny was announced as the half-time act in September, right-wing media circles noted he had criticised the Trump administration's immigration policies.\n\nThe subsequent decision to give vocal Trump critics Green Day a slot in the pre-game entertainment went down equally well.\n\nLast week, when Bad Bunny picked up his Grammy for Album of the Year, he began his acceptance speech with the words: \"ICE out.\"\n\nIt prompted one conservative group to organise an alternative half-time show, fronted by Trump ally Kid Rock and the president to label the selection \"absolutely ridiculous\".\n\nOn the way in, anti-ICE protestors offered towels bearing political messaging to Super Bowl supporters.\n\nBad Bunny's unapologetically Latino set, performed across a temporary jungle in the middle of Levi's Stadium, did not douse Republican ire but provided plenty of entertainment for the 70,000 fans.\n\nThe most-streamed artist of 2025 was all bouncing energy, flanked by a myriad of dancers and through a whirlwind of movement and rapid lyrics, he became the first performer to conduct the half-time show fully in Spanish.\n\nThere was time to squeeze in some special guests, including compatriot Ricky Martin and pop royalty Lady Gaga, who performed an extract from her song 'Die With A Smile'. In English.\n\nFinally, as fireworks signalled the end of a high-octane set, Bad Bunny brandished the football he had been carrying to show the words 'Together, we are America', before disappearing from the field.\n\nPresident Trump, who became the first incumbent to attend the Super Bowl last year in New Orleans, was not there in person but labelled the show \"an affront to America\" and \"a slap in the face to our country\".\n\nThe Super Bowl is a magnet for celebrity guests and few are bigger than rock icon Jon Bon Jovi, who introduced the New England Patriots to the crowd before the game.\n\nOn the other side, Hollywood actor Chris Pratt did likewise for his beloved Seahawks, while actors Macauley Culkin and Jessica Alba were among those in attendance.\n\nThey were joined in the stands by rappers Jay-Z and Travis Scott, as well as Cardi B, in town to support boyfriend and Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs - and do some dancing alongside Bad Bunny.\n\nAs for sports stars, tennis legend Roger Federer and seven-time world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton also watched on from the galleries.\n\nFinally, decorated quarterbacks Peyton Manning and Joe Montana joined Brady for the ceremonial coin toss.\n\nNotifications, social media and more with BBC Sport",

    "description": "Head coach Andy Farrell has largely been a loyal selector throughout his Ireland tenure but will last week's heavy loss in Paris lead to changes for Italy in Dublin on Saturday?",
    "fullText": "When Andy Farrell took charge of Ireland after the 2019 World Cup, Joe Schmidt's erstwhile defensive specialist faced calls to radically overhaul a team that had clearly dropped from a considerable peak.\n\nIn 2018, Ireland had won a Six Nations Grand Slam and beaten New Zealand in Dublin as part of an autumn clean sweep.\n\nThen, having been the head coach in waiting for a year, there was a feeling that Farrell's association with the previous ticket got his tenure started on the back foot.\n\nYet, by the time of his first game in charge in February 2020, Farrell resisted any temptation to enforce a major break from the Schmidt regime, his biggest selection calls revolving around replacing retired veterans Rob Kearney and Rory Best.\n\nWhile handing an international debut to Caelan Doris was a nod to the future, the naming of the then 34-year-old Johnny Sexton as his captain was a clear indication of a focus on the here and now.\n\nAs Ireland muddled through a pair of third-place Six Nations campaigns disrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic, Farrell remained steadfast in his approach of evolution rather than revolution and was rewarded for his faith with a historic series win in New Zealand in 2022 and a Six Nations Grand Slam the next year.\n\nIn the wake of Thursday's humbling defeat by France in Paris to start the 2026 Six Nations however, Farrell has faced the strongest calls since those earliest days of his tenure to dramatically overhaul the team.\n\nWith Italy in Dublin on Saturday afternoon, will the head coach stick or twist?\n\nSaturday, 14 February, 14:10 GMT\n\nListen to full match commentary on BBC Sounds via BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra 2, BBC Radio Ulster and BBC Sport website and app alongside live text commentary\n\nWhile Farrell was accurate when judging his 2020-21 squad as one in transition rather than terminal decline, the mood music around the team feels even more sombre this time around.\n\nIt may only be two years ago that Ireland were chasing the history of back-to-back Grand Slams, but Thursday's loss saw them drop to fifth in the world rankings and they have lost seven of their past nine against the teams above them.\n\nWith the four most recent of those reverses coming by double-digits, Thursday was no isolated incident. It is undeniable that a gap to the world's best has emerged and now widened.\n\nFarrell has always shown himself not to be one to throw the baby out with the bathwater but, whether it be seeking an injection of fresh blood, the heralding of a new direction or simply to prompt a reaction to their Parisian lack of \"intent\", it is clear he has some big selection calls to make before Thursday's team announcement to face the Azzurri.\n\nTo an extent, Farrell had already shaken up his team coming into this championship even when already without Andrew Porter, Tadhg Furlong, Mack Hansen, Hugo Keenan and Robbie Henshaw through injury, while Bundee Aki was suspended.\n\nJacob Stockdale was preferred to James Lowe while, with Tadhg Beirne selected in the second row, the selection of Cian Prendergast ostensibly came at the expense of the benched James Ryan.\n\nLeaving two British and Irish Lions out of the side would once have been viewed as a dramatic shift but the events of Thursday night mean that even some once seemingly cemented places in the side are up for fresh debate.\n\nDespite only playing half an hour at the Stade de France, back row Nick Timoney was arguably Ireland's most impactful player in Paris.\n\nThe Ulster back row's international career is perhaps indicative of how settled Ireland's team has become.\n\nHe made his debut against USA in the summer of 2021 but, before his subsequent role off the bench against France, his next five caps were spread across four and a half years and came against Argentina, as a match-day morning inclusion, Fiji, Georgia, Japan and Australia.\n\nAll through that period, he was consistently among the best and most consistent performers for his province and on Thursday gave the impression of a man who had been impatiently waiting for his first crack at the Six Nations and top-level international opposition.\n\nWhile capable of playing across the back row, it will be Josh van der Flier feeling the pressure at number seven.\n\nAlready 30, Timoney is only two years younger than the 2022 World Player of the Year, but with Van der Flier struggling for his best form this season, it would certainly be a selection for the here and now.\n\nThere is little doubt that Joe McCarthy has a long future in the Ireland engine room.\n\nJust 24 years old, he has a profile that is rare in Irish rugby, providing a real combination of physicality and athleticism in the second row. Indeed, having established himself as a starter only after the 2023 World Cup, he is among the most recent additions to Farrell's starting XV.\n\nHowever, as a penalty concession for coming in at the side straight in front of the posts and right in front of the referee on Thursday shows, his decision-making and discipline remain a major work-on.\n\nIt was only last year, after the reverse fixture in the Six Nations, that the Ireland camp were publicly talking about how the Leinster player would learn from his costly yellow card for pulling back Thomas Ramos.\n\nWhen Ireland were at their best, such transgressions were simply not tolerated.\n\nIn Munster's uncapped Edwin Edogbo, Farrell now has an alternative who could bring similar physical presence to the side and the 23-year-old has shown good form for his province since returning for injury too.\n\nPairing the two together feels like Ireland's future in the position, but Edogbo over McCarthy for Saturday would give the side's most exciting prospect an international bow and offer a reminder of the required standards in a side who have struggled with discipline this season.\n\nFive talking points from Six Nations opening round\n\nLike Van der Flier, Garry Ringrose is a player who has not found his best form after returning from the British and Irish Lions tour of Australia without a Test cap.\n\nThe Leinster centre was arguably the most unfortunate to miss out on facing the Wallabies, admirably self-reporting symptoms of concussion when he had been selected for the second Test.\n\nSo long a key defensive cog for Ireland, despite being at the centre of a debate on the value of missed tackles statistics, the 31-year-old was hardly alone in looking off the pace in Paris but midfield is definitely an area where the side would benefit from experimenting with younger options.\n\nRingrose, Stuart McCloskey, Henshaw, Aki and even the side's most recent debutant Tom Farrell, are all the wrong side of 30 with the next World Cup still one year and eight months away.\n\nJude Postlethwaite was not even in the senior squad until news broke of Aki's impending suspension but he certainly impressed earlier this season for Ulster.\n\nA run against Italy, alongside his provincial colleague McCloskey in midfield, would be an interesting test of his international credentials.\n\nWard rejoins Ireland squad as Furlong nears return\n\n'Scrutiny and pressure on Irish has reached new level'\n\nIreland must 'stop rot' after Paris humbling",

    "fullText": "Formula 1 design legend Adrian Newey says Aston Martin's new car is \"one of the more extreme interpretations\" of this year's new rules.\n\nNewey's comments came as Aston Martin launched their new season on Monday, in a lavish event in Saudi Arabia that was afflicted by technical problems and revealed only the colour scheme on a generic 2026 car, not the team's new design.\n\nThat was waiting across the King Fahd Causeway at the Bahrain International Circuit, where the second pre-season test begins on Wednesday.\n\nNewey, who joined Aston Martin as managing technical partner in March last year, told BBC Sport: \"It seems to be a bit different to some of the other solutions out there.\n\n\"A bit like 2022, there's a new set of aerodynamic regulations, there's been lots of different interpretations. Whether it's the right one or the wrong one, only time will tell.\"\n\nRivals have expressed admiration for the new Aston Martin, which tested in an all-black livery for just one of the permitted three days in the so-called 'shakedown' test in Spain last month.\n\nNewey admitted that the car was not painted there partly because it was ready so late that the team had not had time to do so.\n\nTeams were allowed to run for three of five days in a week at the Circuit de Barcelona-Catalunya, but the Aston Martin was ready in time to go out only late on the fourth afternoon, when it broke down after four laps with Lance Stroll at the wheel. Fernando Alonso then ran for just over 60 laps on the final day of the test.\n\nMercedes driver George Russell, the pre-season championship favourite, described it as \"pretty spectacular\" and said it was \"probably the most standout in terms of the car design and it looks very impressive\".\n\nWilliams team principal James Vowles said it was a \"really, really interesting design\".\n\nNewey, who has a reputation for usually being at the leading edge of innovation when new rules are introduced, said: \"Because of the very compressed design time, we decided on a direction, a single direction, that we would pursue. And that is what we've done.\"\n\nNewey joined a team that had already gone through a series of management changes in the past couple of years, while working to bring on stream a new factory, wind tunnel and driver-in-the-loop simulator.\n\nHe said the design process of this year's car, the team's first as Honda's engine partner, had been \"an incredibly compressed cycle\".\n\nHe added: \"Overall it's been very stimulating and invigorating, exhausting at times as well, of course. But what I found was a lot of individually very talented people who weren't necessarily working that well together.

    "description": "Sam Darnold leading the Seattle Seahawks to Super Bowl glory could just be the greatest redemption story ever in the NFL. We take a closer look.",
    "fullText": "The Sam Darnold redemption story is quite something - from being rated as one of the worst quarterbacks in the NFL to Super Bowl champion.\n\nIt's a tale of never giving up, of character, unwavering self-belief and persistence, but also a warning for teams not to write a quarterback off too soon.\n\nAs youngsters being drafted into the NFL are at the mercy of circumstance, not every team will fit every rookie and the sport's history is littered with college stars deemed not good enough.\n\nThey often bounce around from team to team, as Darnold did, but never has one plumbed the depths before managing to rise up and claim the sport's ultimate prize in the ultimate NFL redemption story.\n\nSeahawks beat Patriots to win Super Bowl 60 with crushing defensive display - as it happened\n\nSeahawks dominate Patriots to win Super Bowl\n\nSo how bad was Darnold? Well, the numbers were not great, as after being drafted in 2018 he spent three seasons with the New York Jets and two with the Carolina Panthers - during which time he ranked bottom or near the bottom in several areas.\n\nWins were the main one - just 21 of them in five seasons - but categories like passer rating and completion percentage were the worst of any quarterback during that time.\n\nAs a third pick in the draft he was ridiculed for his \"seeing ghosts\" comment as he struggled, and labelled a bust, but now he's getting fitted for a Super Bowl ring it's clear he was only part of the problem.\n\nFellow Jets quarterbacks Mark Sanchez, Geno Smith and Zach Wilson also all finished dead last in passer rating in their first three seasons with the team. Notice a theme?\n\nThat's a quirk of the NFL Draft system, the best players go to the worst teams, and while some could just be having an off season so can build for success, some have serious issues.\n\nAfter Sunday, Darnold has now won 39 games since leaving New York, including serving two years as a back-up - the Jets have won just 26.\n\nThe Panthers have won 15 to Darnold's 31 since leaving Carolina and even the Vikings and 49ers can't match his wins since he departed.\n\nPeople forget that at just 21 he was the youngest NFL starting quarterback since the 1970 merger - perhaps the young man was just in the wrong place after all.\n\nFrom 1% chance of survival to Super Bowl winner\n\n\"Quarterbacks need tonnes of help to allow you to go show how great you can be. If you do not get that help, you are limited in how great you can be,\" said former San Francisco 49ers quarterback and three-time Super Bowl champion Steve Young.\n\n\"And there are not 32 places in the league today that can give you that help.\"\n\nYoung knows when a team is not a good fit, as he was drafted by a poor Tampa Bay squad and won three games in two seasons before leaving to join the 49ers and eventually becoming a Hall of Fame member.\n\nIronically enough it was a largely forgotten season in San Francisco that also provided the catalyst for Darnold to launch the comeback of all comebacks.\n\n\"I didn't play great football the first few years of my career,\" Darnold admitted after the Super Bowl. \"Then I come here to San Francisco and I think because of that year I was able to learn a tonne. I was able to kind of learn and go to Minnesota and play good football there. I was able to come to Seattle and do the same.\"\n\nWorking in a fully functioning franchise, learning from coach Kyle Shanahan and serving as back-up to Brock Purdy in a Super Bowl saw Darnold head to Minnesota better equipped to succeed.\n\nThe irony of returning to Levi's Stadium for his crowning glory was not lost on him.\n\nA stellar season in Minnesota came after he replaced injured rookie JJ McCarthy, but then more irony in the Vikings opting to stick with the quarterback they drafted saw Darnold move on again.\n\nHe left after massive career highs of 14 wins, over 4,000 yards and 35 touchdowns, but still with question marks after a play-off capitulation against the Rams.\n\nOnce again, he had a point to prove.\n\nQuarterbacks grab all the headlines, for good or bad, but they simply cannot do it all by themselves in this ultimate team sport.\n\nTom Brady regularly had, and needed, a top-10 defence on his side to win Super Bowls, while Patrick Mahomes lost two of them because he was soundly beaten up by opposing defences.\n\nIn Seattle, Darnold found the perfect storm of a team on the up and a defensive head coach assembling a crack unit that would go on to dominate the NFL, needing just a solid quarterback to steer the offence.\n\nHaving the league's leading receiver Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Super Bowl MVP running back Kenneth Walker also helped, and plenty will say Darnold did not have to do much.\n\nHe became the first quarterback to enjoy successive 14-win seasons with two different teams - only Brady had managed it with one - but still there were questions as he led the league in turnovers, giving the ball away 20 times.\n\nAround 80% of play-off games are won by teams with the fewest turnovers. In Super Bowls the record was 40-7 when winning the turnover battle.\n\nDarnold has the fourth most giveaways in the NFL since being drafted (106) despite spending two years as a back-up, so once again he had to prove himself as he was written off as a liability before even entering the post-season.\n\nThe response was remarkable as Darnold's Seattle became the first Super Bowl champions without a single turnover in the play-offs.\n\nHe answered the mental questions of facing the Rams again with 346 yards and three touchdowns, before doing just enough in the Super Bowl itself.\n\nWas it flashy? No. MVP worthy? Not even close. But Darnold, now 28, did what he had to - he kept hold of the ball, made plays when needed and managed the game without ego or trying to be the hero.\n\nNo quarterback has won a Super Bowl having played for five teams before, but then no quarterback has been counted out so many times and got back to the top.\n\nLuck has played a part, teams like Minnesota and Seattle took a chance and the Seahawks have furnished Darnold with everything he could possibly want in a team - and maybe there's a hatful of quarterbacks in the league who could have won a Super Bowl with them this season.\n\nNone have been where Darnold has though and not many have done more to earn it. His redemption story really is one for the ages.\n\nRevenge, redemption & representation - the story of Super Bowl 60\n\nSeahawks celebrations, Bad Bunny, Lady Gaga - Super Bowl 60 in pictures",

This wildfire is crazy.\"\n\nShe then refused to rule out a comeback at the end of January, telling the Today Show: \"I don't know, I'm just going to see what happens.\"\n\nInterviewer Savannah Guthrie pushed Williams further, saying \"that's a maybe to me\", and the seven-time Wimbledon singles champion said: \"It's not a maybe.\"\n\nAsked whether she had re-entered the drug testing pool, Williams said: \"I don't know if I was out. Listen, I can't discuss this.\n\n\"If I want to put it [rumours] to bed... listen, I want to go to bed.\"\n\nWilliams previously spoke about using weight-loss drugs in August and appeared in a commercial for the drug during Sunday's Super Bowl.\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam singles champion has never liked the word retirement and instead said she was \"evolving away\" from the sport when she ended her career in New York.\n\nOnly Margaret Court and Novak Djokovic have won more Grand Slam singles titles than Williams.\n\nHer haul of seven Australian Open titles, three French Opens, seven Wimbledons and six US Opens is the most major singles titles by any woman in the Open era.\n\nShe and elder sister Venus, who is still active on the WTA Tour, won 14 Grand Slam doubles titles and three Olympic golds together.\n\nLive scores, results and order of play\n\nGet tennis news sent straight to your phone",

I dared to dream and had worked so hard to achieve it.\n\n\"While yesterday did not end the way I had hoped, and despite the intense physical pain it caused, I have no regrets.\n\n\"Standing in the starting gate yesterday was an incredible feeling that I will never forget. Knowing I stood there having a chance to win was a victory in and of itself.\"\n\nVonn crashed in Switzerland in the final race before the Olympics nine days before competing in the downhill event in Italy.\n\nIn a media conference on Wednesday, she confirmed she had torn her anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) but expressed determination to compete.\n\nThe two-time world champion says the torn ACL and her previous injuries, including a partial right knee replacement, \"had nothing to do with my crash whatsoever\".\n\nVonn's decision to race has led to widespread praise for her bravery but also criticism about the dangers and potential risk of permanent damage.\n\n\"It always was and always will be an incredibly dangerous sport.

    "description": "Dave...",
    "fullText": "The Puerto Rican artist’s performance was a gleeful rebuke of Trump’s death cult and a celebration of life.\n\nThe past year in Stephen Miller’s America has been unbearably bleak. When masked thugs with “blanket immunity” kidnap 5-year-olds and murder nurses, it tends to darken the national mood. But international mega-star Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio (aka Bad Bunny) took the stage during the Super Bowl halftime show and gave the best possible response to Miller’s dystopic dreams: a burst of unbridled joy and a dizzying celebration of love, labor, and the power of living our everyday lives despite hardships, all performed in a lyrical language that Miller, in every possible way, lacks the capacity to understand.\n\nPeople should view Bad Bunny’s singular performance as the second part of a political two-step aimed at the white-nativist heart of this racist regime. Part one was a week ago, when, after winning the Grammy for album of the year, Bad Bunny began his acceptance speech by saying, “Before I say thanks to God, I’m going to say: ICE out!”—to rapturous cheers. It was an ingenious first step, teeing up the halftime show as a future instrument for broadcasting the anti-ICE fervor hitting red and blue states alike.\n\nThen came step two: bringing the technicolor beauty of Puerto Rican culture to the Super Bowl stage. In a time of monsters, Bad Bunny was posing an alternative world: a place where laborers are seen and celebrated, where hurricanes and their victims aren’t forgotten, and where community—not atomization—fuels society. In the swirl of his irrepressible music, sung only in Spanish, and an elaborate set design that conjured the Caribbean in rich and playful detail, Bad Bunny refused to step into our dismal world. Instead, he brought us into his.\n\nI saw the game in a bar, where the people watching around me initially seemed more interested in the halftime show because of the controversy around Bad Bunny’s selection as a performer—the prospect of his Spanish-only music had predictably enraged right-wingers and prompted them to launch a counter halftime show, which spectacularly failed. In 30 seconds, though, many were standing and dancing, everyone locked into every move on the stage. When Ricky Martin came out as a surprise guest, you could feel the room swoon. At the end, everyone rose in an actual ovation.\n\nThe performance was so dense with meaning that, during the fourth quarter, people around me turned to discussing what part of the show they connected with the most—and not only because that was more fun than debating whether the Patriots were going to punt again.\n\nFor me, the most powerful moment was when Bad Bunny name-checked, one after the other, every country in the Americas: a bold, delightfully unsubtle statement against white ethnocentrism and USA puffery. When Bad Bunny said during his Grammy speech, “We’re not savage, we’re not animals, we’re not aliens. We are humans, and we are Americans,” the “we are Americans” part had rankled some in immigrant rights circles because it seemed to differentiate the foreign-born. Bad Bunny’s rapid-fire listing—which pointedly did not ignore Cuba or Venezuela—could be seen as a response to that, telling Trump’s cruel regime that “America” is more than just the United States; it’s a region that goes from the top of Canada to the southern tip of Chile. The United States is a part of a community of nations—though it hasn’t been acting like it, instead targeting fishing boats off the coasts of other members of this community and blasting them from the sky like some fascist Death Star.\n\nBad Bunny’s performance will launch a thousand term papers intent on decoding every last moment, including when he gave a Grammy to a young child who had been watching from a staged living room seemingly set in Puerto Rico. Such a scene was particularly resonant knowing that, earlier in January, a 5-year-old boy from Minnesota named Liam Ramos had been abducted from his school by ICE and sent to a Texas detention center. Immediately after the show, people began debating online whether the child on stage was Ramos himself. He wasn’t, but it speaks to how deftly Bad Bunny pulled off his two-step that masses of people thought so.\n\nIn response, of course, Trump had a racist temper tantrum. Perhaps he was offended by a billboard in the background—in English, for his benefit—that read, “The only thing more powerful than hate is love.” For this cowardly regime, it’s now a political act just to acknowledge the cultural power of Puerto Rico, to speak a beautiful language, to sing, and to dance, and to live in peace.\n\nDuring this show of shows, it was difficult to not think about a more serious moment at a recent Bad Bunny concert in Chile. There, the artist led the crowd in a song by legendary Chilean folksinger Victor Jara, who was something like the Bob Dylan of Chile, and whose songs of protest were known around the world. Shortly after the 1973 coup, Augusto Pinochet’s thugs mutilated his guitar-playing hands before the dictator had him publicly executed. Perhaps Jara’s most famous song was “El Derecho de Vivir en la Paz.” Bad Bunny had the entire crowd singing this 60-year-old song. For those who don’t know what it means, the title translates to “The Right to Live in Peace.”\n\nOne of Pinochet’s early orders was to paint over the vibrant, revolutionary murals of Chile, covering them in gray. Bad Bunny’s performance was an act of protest against such repression. It was the revenge of the muralistas. And not a moment too soon.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.

    "fullText": "Members of Congress have a constitutional duty to remove this gangster from office.\n\nBruce Springsteen used the first great protest song of 2026, his “Streets of Minneapolis,” to deliver a blistering condemnation of the violent assault that a strike force of 3,000 masked and armed agents of the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has waged on Minnesota’s largest city. The American bard describes how, during the first weeks of January, Minneapolis became “a city aflame…’neath an occupier’s boots” and recounts that “there were bloody footprints where mercy should have stood and two left to die on snow-filled streets: Alex Pretti and Renee Good.” Springsteen was not merely mourning; he was calling out the Trump administration’s propagandistic distortion of the truth about Pretti, an intensive-­care nurse with the Department of Veterans Affairs, gunned down by Border Patrol agents on January 24, and Good, a poet and mother of three, shot in the head by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent on January 7. And the Boss excoriated “Noem’s dirty lies.”\n\nThe lies told by DHS Secretary Kristi Noem, including wildly unfounded assertions that Good and Pretti committed acts of “domestic terrorism,” have inspired widespread demands for accountability for the most dangerously dishonest of Donald Trump’s miserable cast of cabinet appointees. There is plenty of competition for the “worst of the worst” title in Trump’s cabinet. But Noem’s attempts to defend the indefensible, her personal and official scandals, her mismanagement, and above all her outrageous and propagandistic lies about Good and Pretti are not merely shameful. They are impeachable.\n\nMembers of Congress, no matter their political affiliation, must recognize a constitutional duty to remove this gangster from the position of public trust that she has so flagrantly abused. The will of the people is already clear. Trump and Noem thought they could intimidate the public into quiescence. But tens of thousands of Americans have filled the streets of Minneapolis and cities across the country to demand the abolition of ICE because they have chosen to believe their own eyes, as opposed to Noem’s lies.\n\nThe arguments against Noem are now so stark that even senior Republicans are making the case for her removal, with North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis raging against “the incompetence of the leader of the [Department of] Homeland Security,” adding, “She doesn’t know how to lead, how to de-escalate. She’s exposing ICE officers to dangerous situations; she’s exposing US citizens to deadly situations.” Even as Trump tried to distance himself from some of Noem’s most extreme statements and policies in late January, the president’s response to Tillis and to Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, another Republican who’s said the secretary should go, was to call the senators “losers” and announce that Noem would be staying because “she’s doing a very good job.”\n\nWith Trump digging in, it falls to members of Congress to act. Many Democrats have done just that, as part of the most significant accountability movement yet seen during the year of chaos that Trump and his noxious inner circle of aides, such as Stephen Miller, have unleashed. In addition to tentative calls from Republicans for Noem’s resignation or firing, a robust movement to impeach the cabinet secretary has attracted support from over 180 House Democrats as of February 2. Supporters of impeachment have rallied around a resolution sponsored by Representative Robin Kelly (D-IL) that indicts Noem for obstructing the congressional oversight of detention facilities operated by DHS; for “using her position for personal gain while inappropriately using taxpayer dollars”; for “using her position to circumvent the Federal contracting process and [funnel] Federal funds to her friends’ businesses”; and for “repeatedly [violating] the Immigration and Nationality Act, the First and Fourth Amendments of the United States Constitution, and due process rights of American citizens by directing [ICE] to make widespread warrantless arrests, forgo due process, and use violence against United States citizens, lawful residents, and other individuals.”\n\nThe resolution notes that, in the case of Renee Good, “despite video showing the officer on the side of the vehicle while firing and the vehicle was moving away from the officer on the second and third shots, Kristi Lynn Arnold Noem is claiming publicly that the officer was in danger and in front of the vehicle when he fired.” That lie points to the most compelling argument for Noem’s removal: She is a determined propagandist who seeks to distort the truth, undermine investigations, and divide Americans. And all the evidence suggests that she intends to keep lying to the American people, the media, and Congress.\n\nNone of the House members who propose to impeach Noem are naïve. They know that the full constitutional promise of the impeachment power has been undermined by Senate Republicans who have refused to hold members of their own party—including Trump himself—to account. And they know that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) will do everything in his power to thwart accountability for Trump and his appointees—just as he did during the fight over the release of files regarding the convicted child-sex offender and longtime Trump associate Jeffrey Epstein. But the anger over Noem’s reckless actions and scorching dishonesty has momentum, which could force congressional action in much the way that US Representatives Ro Khanna (D-CA) and Thomas Massie (R-KY) ultimately did in their fight for the release of the Epstein files.\n\nKhanna has emerged as an ardent supporter of Noem’s impeachment because “she’s presided over agents who are killing American citizens.” The California representative includes Noem’s impeachment on a list of steps that, he says, must be taken to rein in ICE and DHS. “Congress is not powerless. Democrats must unify around an actual agenda,” argues Khanna, who urges opposition to future DHS funding, a repeal of the multiyear $75 billion in funding for ICE that Congress approved last year, investigations and prosecutions of ICE agents who have broken the law, and a strategy to “tear down and replace ICE with an agency that has oversight.”\n\nTo that list, we would add formal action by Congress to bar ICE agents from interfering with the 2026 midterms.\n\nWe understand that some will ask why Noem’s impeachment should be a priority with so many threats to be addressed and so many other members of the Trump administration who merit removal (including Trump himself). Our answer is that this is an accountability movement that has gained traction, has the potential to attract at least some Republican support, and above all will send a message to the whole administration that, to quote Springsteen, “We’ll remember the names of those who died on the streets of Minneapolis”—and the lies that have been told about Renee Good, Alex Pretti, and all the others who have died on Kristi Noem’s watch.\n\nFrom Minneapolis to Venezuela, from Gaza to Washington, DC, this is a time of staggering chaos, cruelty, and violence.\n\nUnlike other publications that parrot the views of authoritarians, billionaires, and corporations, The Nation publishes stories that hold the powerful to account and center the communities too often denied a voice in the national media—stories like the one you’ve just read.\n\nEach day, our journalism cuts through lies and distortions, contextualizes the developments reshaping politics around the globe, and advances progressive ideas that oxygenate our movements and instigate change in the halls of power.\n\nThis independent journalism is only possible with the support of our readers.
