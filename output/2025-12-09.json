    "fullText": "Story by (© Steven Bisig-Imagn Images)Joe RutlandTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:28 AM UTC·3 min readAs buzz around the Winter Meetings stirred up a bit surrounding Detroit Tigers ace pitcher Tarik Skubal, potentially tying him to the Los Angeles Dodgers, a Tigers official didn't say that Skubal was untouchable.In fact, Tigers president of baseball operations Scott Harris was as about noncommittal as one can get when it comes to Skubal.AdvertisementEarlier on Monday, Dodgers Roundtable posted a story where a reporter for KTLA in Los Angeles had received some information connecting Skubal with the Dodgers.When Harris spoke on Monday, he refused to even say that Skubal was untouchable. As an article from MLB.com Tigers reporter Jason Beck states, too, former Tigers president Dave Dombrowski would also not call any player on the team untouchable.But, with the heat rising on a potential Skubal-to-Los Angeles trade, Harris stuck to his guns.\"It’s just really hard to answer the question,\" Harris said, \"and I’ll tell you why: One, we don’t speculate on any players on our roster in trade talks. It’s just not productive, and it’s unfair to players on other teams.\"My job is to make this organization better, which means that I need to listen to every opportunity.\"\n\nTigers President of Baseball Operations Scott Harris joins #MLBTonight to talk Tarik Skubal and more from the #WinterMeetings.\n\nMLB Network x @SageUSAmerica pic.twitter.com/Ug0LOvWJ7i— MLB Network (@MLBNetwork) December 9, 2025\"Two, I’ve been pretty clear since I’ve been here: I don’t believe in untouchables at any level, anyone in our organization,\" Harris said. \"It’s not a commentary on Tarik specifically, [but] sort of a blanket team-building approach.Advertisement\"I can't do my job without listening,\" he said. \"I can't do my job without exploring anything that may or may not have legs. Some are going to be very likely moves and some are going to be extremely unlikely, but you can't actually fully vet those opportunities unless you are willing to listen. …\"I don’t know if that’s helpful for you guys, but I figured I’d give you at least some logic behind why we’re taking this approach.\"When thinking about this potential blockbuster, the Dodgers do have a couple of things in their favor. They have the money, obviously, and they also have some players, too.What type of deal could Los Angeles put together, though? Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman and general manager Brendan Gomes are in Orlando, Fla., right now at the Winter Meetings.AdvertisementIn the MLB.com report about Harris' comments, the article indicates that there was no push around any type of trade talks at this time.Harris was even asked about looking beyond next season, when both Skubal and Casey Mize would become free agents.\"For a variety of reasons, we’re pretty focused on ‘26 right now,\" Harris said. \"There’s a ton of uncertainty coming after the season, in a variety of ways, so we’re pretty focused on ‘26 right now.\"If there’s an opportunity for us to get better in ‘26, we’re going to take it,\" he said. \"If, in addition to the opportunity to get better in ‘26 we’re going to get better in ‘27, ‘28 and ‘29, obviously we’re going to look at that view.\"AdvertisementHarris didn't say yes to a Skubal trade. Harris didn't say no to a Skubal trade.He appears to be keeping his cards close to his chest at this time.Well, there's still time left at the Winter Meetings and, of course, time after them if Harris might make a deal involving Skubal.",

    "fullText": "Story byPhil Jones says Chelsea are “one or two players short” of challenging for the titleThe Chelsea NewsTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:30 AM UTC·2 min readFormer Manchester United defender Phil Jones believes that Chelsea are one or two players short of challenging for the title.He’s not alone in that opinion either, it seems to be a regular view of many pundits, former players, and the Chelsea fan base right now.AdvertisementEXCLUSIVE! Chelsea have THREE Premier League centre midfielders on the radar – two they would LOVE to sign!There aren’t many who ever really believed that Chelsea would win the Premier League title this season, but there are many who believe that they are getting closer and closer to challenging to do just that.Next season is the season that they believe Chelsea will be true title challengers, but of course, only time will tell if those predictions turn out having any weight to them.Chelsea’s recent form has continued to be very up and down and inconsistent. After thrashing Barcelona and playing very well against Arsenal a couple of weeks back, there was a dull 0-0 draw against Bournemouth on Saturday, and a 3-1 defeat to Leeds United last week to bring them back down to earth again.AdvertisementJones impressed with ChelseaEnzo Maresca arrives at Stamford Bridge. (Photo by Steve Bardens/Getty Images)Jones, who of course is not longer playing football, has been impressed with Chelsea.Speaking to Sports Illustrated this week, Jones said:“I think they’ve quietly gone about the business. So I think it’s quite a nice place to be at in terms of Maresca, what he’s thinking. I like the players they’ve got. I think he’s built a really good team there. I like his ideas.“I still think they’re the one or two players short on being really challenging for the title, but I think, you know, slowly but surely. I think next year they’ll have a real good challenge if they recruit well.”",

Diego Simeone’s side have lost their last three Champions League away games. Another defeat would see them equal their worst-ever run on the road in this competition. Despite their travel sickness, Atlético have a formidable record against Dutch opposition.AdvertisementThey are unbeaten against Eredivisie teams in the Champions League this century. Moreover, they have never lost to PSV in six previous meetings. Simeone will rely on this historical dominance and his team’s “clutch” ability to score late goals to secure a vital result.Atlético Madrid team newsDiego Simeone is without key defender José María Giménez due to a hamstring injury. Consequently, Clément Lenglet is expected to partner David Hancko in central defence. In midfield, Johnny Cardoso is also out with a knee problem. This means captain Koke will likely return to the starting lineup to provide experience and control.Up front, Julián Álvarez will lead the line. The Argentine has been directly involved in 13 Champions League goals since last season and will be the main threat, supported by Giuliano Simeone and Thiago Almada.AdvertisementAtlético Madrid predicted LineupAtlético Madrid predicted XI: Musso; Molina, Hancko, Lenglet, Ruggeri; Gallagher, Barrios, Koke; Simeone, Álvarez, AlmadaWhen will the match kick off?The Champions League fixture will be played at the Philips Stadion on Tuesday, 9 December 2025, with kick-off scheduled for 8:00 pm GMT.How to watch PSV Eindhoven vs Atlético Madrid?The match will be broadcast live in the UK on TNT Sports and Amazon Prime Video.

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.It’s been some season for the Los Angeles Lakers to start the year, as they currently sit in second place in the Western Conference with a 17–6 record.AdvertisementMuch of the Lakers’ success early in the 2025–26 NBA season has been due to what Luka Doncic has been able to do on the offensive side of the basketball.Doncic has been just as good as ever, averaging a ridiculous 35.0 points per game.To make matters even worse for Dallas Mavericks fans, he’s doing it in every possible way.Doncic now has 11 30-point double-doubles after finishing with 31 points, 15 rebounds, and 11 assists against the Philadelphia 76ers on Sunday night.According to StatMuse, Doncic has more 30-point double-doubles than the Mavericks have wins this season.“Fun Fact: Luka has more 30-point double-doubles (11) than the Mavs have wins (9) this season,” StatMuse posted on X.AdvertisementThe Mavericks started the season as one of the worst teams in the NBA, but they’ve figured some things out in recent weeks.They haven’t been great at 5-5, but that’s much better than how Dallas looked early on.Still, it’s impossible to suggest that the Mavericks made the right decision when they moved on from Doncic in a deal involving Anthony Davis.Davis is a great player in his own right, but as Lakers fans have now seen, Doncic’s ability to do everything on the court is simply unmatched.More news:Texas Tech commit breaks 72-year old TX HS football rushing recordThe Raiders with one of the worst bad beats you'll ever seeChet Holmgren shows the proper respect to Red PandaNotre Dame rushed for more yards in the SEC title game than AlabamaCommanders pulled an RG3 on Jayden DanielsThe only 2 kickers as bad this season as Harrison Butker have been released",

    "fullText": "Story byLiverpool one step closer to dream Xabi Alonso appointmentAnfield WatchTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:35 AM UTC·2 min readLiverpool are now closing in on a dream appointment to replace Arne Slot. Right now it seems almost impossible to believe the Dutchman can turn this rotten run of form around at Anfield. In the 2025 calendar year, Liverpool have won just 50% of their games.AdvertisementWith Inter Milan coming up on Tuesday night, it looks like that record is going to get even worse. Milan are on the back of a 4-0 victory against Como and they look like they are going to be right up for it at the San Siro.How long Liverpool's run of form can continue to last while the dressing room is also divided remains to be seen.Slot right now just doesn't seem to have things figured out. With Mohamed Salah speaking out against him as well, the head coach's position has only gotten worse.It's just feels like a matter of when not if Slot is relieved of his duties.Obviously, it's one thing sacking Slot but it's another thing trying to replace him. Liverpool cannot just go for anyone. They need someone competent enough to make sure this doesn't unfold into an even bigger crisis.AdvertisementHow can Liverpool do that?Well the answer might be Xabi Alonso, who was on the club's radar when Jurgen Klopp departed.At the time Alonso felt like he wasn't ready to leave Bayer Leverkusen, so Liverpool appointed Slot instead.Now he has since taken over at Real Madrid. Unfortunately or perhaps fortunately for Liverpool things have not turned out so well for the Spaniard in Madrid.Taking over a team full of egos, Real Madrid's stars have not taken to Alonso's system that requires them to run and work hard.Subsequently, results have suffered and Real Madrid are now on the cusp of letting Alonso go.AdvertisementAccording to Marca, he could lose his job if Real Madrid are defeated by Manchester City or if the board does not see a reaction from the squad.The report claims that the Madrid board has a discussion late last night and this was the conclusion. It also goes into detail how they have already lined up alternative options that includes Jurgen Klopp and Zinedine Zidane.This would be a dream scenario for Liverpool.Just because things have not worked out for Alonso doesn't mean it would be the same for him at Anfield. He's the perfect candidate to replace Slot and if he is fired he would be almost guaranteed to be on the club's shortlist.These developments at Madrid are definitely putting him one step closer to the best possible scenario for the Reds.It's something to keep a close eye on.",

    "description": "Hurts had a career-high five giveaways in Monday night's loss to the Chargers.",
    "fullText": "Story byMyles SimmonsTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:34 AM UTC·3 min readEagles quarterback Jalen Hurts had a particularly ugly performance in Monday night's 22-19 overtime loss to the Chargers.He finished the night 21-of-40 passing for 240 yards with four interceptions and a lost fumble, setting a new career high with four picks and five total giveaways. Of course, the last interception was the most consequential, as the Eagles were in a strong position to at least tie the game if not win it before Cam Hart tipped a pass that Tony Jefferson picked off to end the contest.Advertisement“I knew it was going to be a tight-window throw,” Hurts said postgame of the last interception. “I’d have to watch the film to see it from the film’s point of view. Ultimately, it’s a play that I didn’t make. He got a hand on the ball and I didn’t make the play.“That’s a play that we’ve made a million times in that scenario versus a cloud corner and I didn’t make that play this time around.”Generally, Hurts said he had too many turnovers, which was a clear factor in the loss. As a player who has not turned the ball over much throughout his career, Hurts uncharacteristically now has seven giveaways in his last two games.Is this an outlier or a trend?Advertisement“That’s for everyone else to determine,” Hurts said. “For me, we lost the game and I didn’t play well enough to help us win the game. And so, I look at it like I look at every game in terms of win or loss — how I respond to what the game presented [in] itself. So, that’s my mentality.”With the Eagles having lost each of their last three games, Hurts wants to make sure he’s leading the team to be as resilient as possible moving forward. Philadelphia will begin the last quarter of the season by hosting the Raiders next Sunday afternoon.“I think winning is a point of pride to me. That’s why we play the game. And I’ve got to find ways to lead our team to victories,” Hurts said. “It’s not something that’s foreign to us. We’re just not able to do it at the moment. It starts with me and how I play, how I lead, and how I go out there and do my job. So, when I look at it, at any point, it’s about how I respond to a test — how I respond to it and what level of resilience and resolve I have to push forward and figure things out.“[I]t definitely stings, definitely stings,” Hurts added. “But, how do you respond? And that’s the only way I know how to look at it. Again, you’re going to see what type of resolve [this team has] — what’s in us to respond the way we want to. So, we’ve just got to dig.”",

Crucially, they have kept clean sheets in their last three home Champions League games. Extending that defensive solidity will be key against a Slavia side struggling for goals. A win would put Spurs in a strong position to qualify for the knockout stages.Tottenham Hotspur team newsThomas Frank faces a significant defensive loss with Destiny Udogie ruled out until January with a hamstring injury. Consequently, Djed Spence is expected to start at left-back. The manager also has doubts over Brennan Johnson, who is “touch and go” for the match.With key attackers Dominic Solanke and Dejan Kulusevski still out, Wilson Odobert is likely to come into the attacking trio. He will support Richarlison, who leads the line, while Lucas Bergvall partners João Palhinha in midfield.AdvertisementTottenham Hotspur predicted LineupTottenham Hotspur predicted XI: Vicario; Porro, Danso, Van de Ven, Spence; Palhinha, Bergvall; Kudus, Simons, Odobert; RicharlisonWhen will the match kick off?The Champions League fixture takes place at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium on Tuesday, 9 December 2025.

    "description": "The Vancouver Canucks fell 4-0 to the Red Wings on Monday night.",
    "fullText": "Story byAdam KierszenblatTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:42 AM UTC·4 min readThe Vancouver Canucks suffered their second shutout of the season as they fell 4-0 to the Detroit Red Wings. Kevin Lankinen stopped 10 of the 13 shots he faced through two periods, before being pulled to start the third. As for Nikita Tolopilo, he looked solid in the final frame, stopping all six shots he faced.John Gibson was the story of the night as he stopped all 39 shots he faced. The Red Wings' goaltender was impressive throughout, but really stepped up in the third as he stopped all 17 shots he faced. Gibson has dominated the Canucks throughout his career, and now improves to 14-5-2 with four shutouts in 22 games.AdvertisementMonday was yet another in a long list of frustrating games for Vancouver. They won the puck possession battle, yet could not find a way to make their scoring chances count. Post-game, Quinn Hughes spoke about some of the plays that led directly to goals.\"I feel like they have breakdowns too,\" said Hughes. Ours were definitely significant tonight. I mean, our goalies have been really good, kept us in a lot of games, but just something we have to continue working on.\"As mentioned, the Canucks elected to pull Lankinen at the end of the second. This was the first time Lankinen has been pulled this season in what was his 17th game of the year. Post-game, Head Coach Adam Foote spoke on the decision while also touching on Lankinen's overall play as of late.\"I thought he was a little off, even though we did have mistakes, said Foote. \"The one where we double up. He had the tip guy alone. Thought it also would give the guys a little bit of a spark, as they go on in the third. Lanks has been a good pro, and sometimes it's just not your night. And it wasn't all on him. He was left alone a couple of times, but just see if we get the guys going.AdvertisementFoote also gave a few injury updates post-game. When asked about center Elias Pettersson, he said, \"I know he felt better today, which is a good sign. I'll know more in the next couple of days. As far as the time frame, I don't want to touch on that yet.\"As for Thatcher Demko, his return could be sooner rather than later. While Foote would not give a guarantee, he did indicate that the plan is to play Demko on Thursday. Demko has been out since November 11 with a lower-body injury.Lastly, Vancouver's home record dropped to 4-9-1 with today's loss. Just like the players, fans are tired of the losses, and it showed on Monday as there were many open seats after puck drop. When asked about the home record, DeBrusk spoke about how the troubles at Rogers Arena are something the team has discussed.\"Our record isn't great in general, said DeBrusk. \"We obviously want to be there at home. I think we talked about it a lot, and we need to make this a harder place to play in general, and give some of the fans something to cheer about. They pay a lot of money, and it's never good putting up a goose egg.AdvertisementMonday's game was a good representation of the Canucks season to this point. Vancouver generated scoring chances, but defensive mistakes ended up costing them a win. As mentioned, it was another frustrating result that resulted in fans leaving Rogers Arena before the final whistle.Dec 8, 2025; Vancouver, British Columbia, CAN; Vancouver Canucks forward Jake DeBrusk (74) watches as Detroit Red Wings goalie John Gibson (36) makes a save in the second period at Rogers Arena.

    "description": "The gritty victory improved the Chargers' record to 9-4 and solidified their playoff push.",
    "fullText": "Story byAlex Katson, Chargers WireTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:47 AM UTC·4 min readThe Chargers outlasted the Eagles in a 22-19 defensive showdown on Monday Night Football that required overtime to resolve.Here's what to take away from the game.Cam Hart and Tony Jefferson step upEntering Monday, Hart had statistically been the worst of the Chargers' main four cornerbacks. He had an illegal contact penalty while defending AJ Brown in the first half and struggled on and off to contain Brown, who had six catches for 100 yards, all evening. But two crucial plays from Hart ended up sealing the victory for the Chargers. He corralled an interception off of Brown's hands on a misplaced seam ball from Jalen Hurts and returned it into field goal range to set up the game-tying field goal in the fourth quarter. On the final play of the game, Hart read Hurts' eyes and sunk into the empty space to make a diving tip that allowed Jefferson to make the interception to win the game.AdvertisementSpeaking of Jefferson, the veteran has had a rocky season. He missed the initial 53-man roster despite a strong preseason. He was a healthy scratch for a few weeks while LA gave rookie RJ Mickens more reps. But he now has two straight games with tip-drill interceptions, the latter of which put the icing on a crucial win for the Chargers in the AFC playoff picture.Justin Herbert goes to warNothing about Herbert's stat line on Monday screams stardom. The Chargers quarterback completed less than 50 percent of his passes, had only 136 yards, and threw his 11th interception of the season. But the box score doesn't tell the full story of Herbert's night. He battled through a broken hand that he seemed to aggravate a few times throughout the night, was bandaged and re-bandaged four different times for a wound on his left elbow, and took seven sacks and 11 hits. As the game wore on and the Eagles' coverage remained tight - wide receivers accounted for only seven receptions for 60 yards - Herbert had to take on more of a role as a runner despite the injuries. He pulled two read-option plays to generate chunk gains and scrambled on what felt like every play down the stretch to lead the charge for Los Angeles to outlast Philadelphia.Cameron Dicker's MVP performanceIt helps to have the most accurate kicker in the history of the sport in games like Monday's, and Dicker's 5-for-5 night ended up being the difference, considering that Eagles kicker Jake Elliott went 4-for-5 with a miss from 48 yards out to end the first half. Dicker was pressed into action from 54 yards out in overtime to take the lead after nailing a 46-yarder with 12 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to send the game to overtime. He accounted for 16 of LA's 22 points - Omarion Hampton had the other six on a first-quarter receiving touchdown.AdvertisementThree-headed monsterHampton returned from injured reserve on Monday after missing nine weeks with a fractured ankle and split carries with Kimani Vidal, who had been handling the workload in Hampton's absence. The rookie had 13 carries for 56 yards and had two receptions for 11 yards and the Chargers' only touchdown of the game, which doubled as his first career receiving touchdown. Vidal had 14 carries for 44 yards and a 60-yard catch-and-run on the opening drive that set up Hampton's touchdown. Add in Herbert's team-leading 66 yards on 10 rushes and a 3-yard end-around from Tre' Harris, and the Chargers ran for 169 yards on Monday, an encouraging sign for their viability going forward.Jesse Minter masterclassHurts had only thrown two interceptions all season coming into Monday's game, but the Chargers tripled that number by picking him off four different times en route to the win. Da'Shawn Hand fooled Hurts by dropping into coverage over the middle for the first one in the second quarter, which also went into the box score as a lost fumble for Hurts after Hand fumbled into Hurts' arms, only for the ball to be knocked away by Jamaree Caldwell and recovered by Troy Dye. On the next drive, Hurts had a route jumped by Donte Jackson. Hart's fourth-quarter interception made it three, then Jefferson made it four to end the game. Mickens almost had a fifth pick in the first quarter but could not quite corral the ball before it hit the ground. It seemed as though Hurts had trouble seeing the field against Minter's defense - ESPN color commentator Troy Aikman mentioned Hurts struggling to find his checkdown multiple times during the broadcast. With a tough schedule remaining on the docket, the defense playing at the level it did on Monday is a beacon of hope going forward.This article originally appeared on Chargers Wire: Chargers vs. Eagles: 5 takeaways from LA’s 22-19 win in Week 14",

    "fullText": "Story byMark Wood has taken 119 wickets in 38 Tests for England [Getty Images]Stephan Shemilt - Chief Cricket Reporter in NoosaTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:36 AM UTC·3 min readFast bowler Mark Wood has been ruled out of England's Ashes tour and replaced in the squad by Matthew Fisher.Wood only returned to action in the first Test in Perth after eight months out following knee surgery.AdvertisementThe 35-year-old subsequently suffered swelling in the same left knee and was forced to miss the second Test.England were initially hopeful he could play a part in the remaining three Tests, but the Durham man is now due to go home at the weekend.\"Gutted to be out the remainder of the Ashes,\" wrote Wood in a post on Instagram.\"After extensive surgery and months of work and rehab to get back into the Test arena, my knee just hasn't held up.\"None of us expected this. I came here with high expectations about making a big impact. I'm desperately disappointed that despite yet more injections and intensive medical treatment it has become clear that the flare up in my knee is worse than feared.Advertisement\"I'm really sorry that has left me unable to perform as expected but it is not for want of trying.\"However, he said he will attempt to make another comeback.\"Whatever happens I will continue to push the limits to get back again,\" Wood added. \"It has been a tough road these past few months but I remain determined to give it another proper go.\"I still believe we can turn things around. Never give in. Come on England.\"It is a huge blow to the tourists - who are already 2-0 down - and to Wood, whose international future is now in doubt.One of the fastest bowlers to ever play for England, Wood has taken 119 wickets in 38 Tests since making his debut in 2015.AdvertisementHe was part of the team that won the Ashes in 2015, lifted the 2019 50-over World Cup and was in the England squad that won the T20 World Cup in 2022.His career has been blighted by injuries and the Perth Test was the end of a 15-month absence from Test cricket, firstly because of an elbow injury, then the knee problem.Wood bowled 11 overs at Perth Stadium, without taking a wicket. He has travelled with the rest of the England squad to their mid-series break in Noosa, but will not be part of the group for the third Test in Adelaide, beginning on 17 December (23:30 16 December GMT).Surrey's Fisher, 28, won his only Test cap on a tour of the West Indies in 2022. He has been part of the England Lions squad on their tour of Australia.AdvertisementConsidered adept at bowling with the Kookaburra ball used in Australia, Fisher gets the nod ahead of Josh Hull.Sonny Baker and Tom Lawes would have been other options, but both were ruled out of the Lions squad with injuries.Meanwhile, Australia's Josh Hazlewood has also been ruled out of the remainder of the series.Hazlewood, 34, initially missed the first two Tests with a hamstring problem and has now suffered an Achilles tendon setback.However, Australia coach Andrew McDonald confirmed captain Pat Cummins is set to make his comeback when the hosts reveal their squad for the third Test on Wednesday.AdvertisementWith Cummins due to return from a back problem and off-spinner Nathan Lyon likely to play in Adelaide after being left out of the day-night in Brisbane, Australia will make at least two changes to their team.Seamers Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett are the candidates to be left out.Australia could also recall batter Usman Khawaja after the opener struggled in the first Test with a back injury, then missed the second.McDonald said Khawaja could return at number five, leaving a new opening partnership of Travis Head and Jake Weatherald intact.Get cricket news sent straight to your phone",

    "fullText": "Story byMike FlorioTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:42 AM UTC·2 min readWhen the news broke that the Colts will give a workout to a quarterback who last played in the team's most recent playoff game in January 2021, I thought it was a joke.The joke may ultimately be on the Colts.AdvertisementMaybe 44-year-old Philip Rivers has something more than fumes in the lawnmower tank after more than four and a half seasons of retirement. Maybe he'll do enough to stop the 1-4 slide that has followed a 7-1 start.But they're bringing in Rivers because there aren't many other options. That's because, in part, the trade deadline came and went five weeks ago.Primary backup (and former starter) Anthony Richardson suffered an orbital fracture before the team's Week 6 game. The Colts had 22 days to make a deal for a veteran to serve as the understudy to Daniel Jones, who has had multiple injuries during his career. They opted to ride with rookie Riley Leonard and Brett Rypien.Now that Jones is done for the year and Leonard emerged from his debut with an injury of his own, the Colts are scrambling. The fact that Rivers got a call shows how they feel about available free agents like Taylor Heinicke and Sam Ehlinger. (For all anyone knows, they'll both be showing up for Tuesday's tryout, too.)AdvertisementAnd to the extent that a team would be willing to release a veteran (e.g., the Giants and Russell Wilson), any player who is cut at this point of the calendar must pass through waivers. Even Derek Carr, who is on the Saints’ reserve/retired list, would be subject to waivers if the Saints were to relinquish his contractual rights.The point is that the Colts could have tried, during the three weeks between the Richardson injury and the trade deadline, to make a deal for a veteran. Maybe they did and simply couldn't come to an agreement with a willing team.Regardless, it was a calculated risk to have Jones, Leonard, and Rypien. Now, the Colts may be down to Rypien and Rivers. Which will make it very hard to avoid becoming the sixth team since the 1970 merger to miss the playoffs after winning seven or more of its first eight games.",

    "fullText": "Story byMookie AlexanderTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:57 AM UTC·2 min readIt’s hard to believe this is a real thing that is happening in 2025, but the Indianapolis Colts need a lot of quarterback help, and they may need the services of a literal grandfather in an emergency.Daniel Jones is out for the year after tearing his Achilles, Anthony Richardson is on IR with an orbital fracture and will not be available for Week 15, and now would-be backup Riley Leonard is uncertain to play against the Seattle Seahawks. The Notre Dame rookie is dealing with a strained knee ligament, which puts his status for Sunday’s trip to Lumen Field in doubt.AdvertisementSo no Jones, no Richardson, maybe no Leonard, which brings us to former Seahawks practice squad player Brett Rypien as Indy’s next option. Desperate times call for desperate measures, but it doesn’t get much more desperate than seriously asking 44-year-old Philip Rivers if he wants to return to where he ended his career… five years ago.The #Colts are planning to bring potential Hall of Fame QB Philip Rivers into their facility Tuesday to work out to see if he may join their practice squad, per me & @MikeGarafolo.\n\nThis is real. Daniel Jones’ season is over, Riley Leonard will start, but Rivers may be an option. pic.twitter.com/H3tQW2R3s7— Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) December 8, 2025I don’t even know what to say. The eight-time Pro Bowl selection is best known for his great years with the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers, including three wins over the Seahawks in four starts. All of those starts happened a minimum of seven years ago.Even if he’s just as a practice squad option because Rypien is literally Indy’s practice squad QB, this seems like a genuinely insane idea. What happens if Rivers is signed, elevated for game day, Rypien gets hurt, and Rivers has to come in?AdvertisementPresumably, Jeff George was unavailable.By the way, Colts rookie tight end Tyler Warren is another emergency quarterback option. And on another note, they don’t have a first-round pick until 2028 after their midseason relinquishing of two firsts for Sauce Gardner, who may also be out for the Seahawks game due to injury.",

On Monday night, Hurts had four interceptions, a lost fumble, and no touchdowns in a 22-19 overtime loss to the Chargers.That's eight total turnovers in one weekend for the two most recent Super Bowl quarterbacks.Mahomes completed 14 of 33 passes for 160 yards and three picks against Houston. Hurts completed 21 of 40 throws for 240 yards and four interceptions against L.A.. Putting their numbers together, it's a combined passer rating of 25.29.The Chiefs, at 6-7, face a steep uphill climb to get back to the playoffs. And the Eagles are no lock.

    "fullText": "Story byJoseph SantoliquitoTue, December 9, 2025 at 6:59 AM UTC·7 min readThe Eagles are in free fall, now riding a three-game losing streak into the most important time of the season, after a 22-19 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Chargers on Monday night at SoFi Stadium.The Eagles fell to 8-5 and should still win the NFC East, with four games left against three teams (Las Vegas, Buffalo and Washington) that have a combined 14-24 record. But that appears all the Eagles will win this season, if this offensive fog continues.AdvertisementThis is a team destined for an early playoff exit—and the scary part is that a Super Bowl-winning coaching staff has no idea how to fix the problems that plague this team. Jalen Hurts was not good. He was late getting the ball out of his hands. He missed open receivers. He simply did not see the field. Hurts, it seems, has lost confidence in himself, completing 21 of 40 for 240 yards, throwing a career-high four interceptions, with a career-high five turnovers.Hurts was seeing ghosts in powder blue. The Chargers loaded up the line of scrimmage, sometimes attacking Hurts, sometimes peeling off into coverage. Hurts appeared thoroughly confused.Hurts is clearly not getting the proper guidance he should be from head coach Nick Sirianni or offensive coordinator Kevin Patullo. What is even more troubling is that fault may not be entirely on Sirianni and Patullo. Plays are being called and designed, where receivers are open and Hurts is not seeing them.AdvertisementEven the shouts will ring loud from the mountain top, Sirianni would never think—nor should he think—about benching Hurts.The overtime loss wasted a fine effort from the defense, which sacked Chargers’ quarterback Justin Herbert, playing with screws and a plate in his non-throwing left hand, seven times for minus-33 yards, with strong games from Byron Young, playing in place of the injured Jalen Carter, Reed Blankenship and Jordan Davis.Saquon Barkley also showed a burst of 2024 with a 52-yard touchdown run, and ran for 122 yards, averaging 6.1 yards a carry. But the Eagles abandoned the run in overtime.There was plenty of good, some bad, and a mound of ugly in the Eagles 22-19 overtime Monday night to the Los Angeles Chargers.AdvertisementThe GoodDeVonta Smith’s 28-yard reception down the middle of the field on a third-and-16 to the Chargers’ 47 in overtime.Edge rusher Jaelan Phillips taking down Kimani Vidal for a one-yard loss with 5:46 to play on a first-and-10 at the Chargers’ 25. Jordan Davis’ seven-yard sack with 4:28 to play on a third-and-seven at the Chargers’ 28. Davis finished with six tackles, 1.5 sacks, and two tackles for losses.Saquon Barkley’s 52-yard touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter. The Eagles’ offensive line got out on the play, led by Fred Johnson, Jordan Mailata, and real key blocks by Dallas Goedert kicking out Los Angeles cornerback Ben St-Juste, and Darius Cooper taking out safety RJ Mickens. Mailata actually got away with a hold on the play, clearly grabbing Chargers’ linebacker Khalil Mack. Barkley finished with 122 yards on 20 carries, averaging 6.1 yards a carry.Linebacker Zack Baun and Davis combining to take down Justin Herbert for a nine-yard sack with 2:06 left in the third quarter on second-and-13 at the Chargers’ 13.AdvertisementDefensive tackle Byron Young’s three-yard sack of Justin Herbert at the Eagles’ 16 on the Chargers’ first drive of the second half. Young, playing in place of the injured Jalen Carter, played great, making eight tackles, and had 1.5 sacks.Safety Reed Blankenship coming up to stop Kimani Vidal for a four-yard loss on a first-and-goal at the Eagles’ 13 on the Chargers’ first drive of the second half. Blankenship had a team-high eight tackles, with a team-high six solo tackles.Adoree Jackson’s interception with seven seconds left in the first half, which after the Chargers’ personal foul call, put the Eagles at the Chargers’ 30. The Eagles blew it, when Jake Elliott missed a 48-yard field goal as time expired in the first half.A.J. Brown’s 22-yard reception on the Eagles’ third drive, putting them at the Chargers’ 29. Brown’s third-quarter 26-yard reception set up an Elliott 54-yard field goal with 3:22 to play in the third quarter. Brown later came up with a 19-yard reception with 2:33 to play on a second-and-10 to the Chargers’ 25.AdvertisementLinebacker Nakobe Dean breaking through to rush Herbert on the Chargers’ second drive, forcing an incompletion on third-and-15. Dean causing the fumble by sacking Herbert after Hurts’ second interception, recovered by Byron Young at the Eagles’ 42 with 4:30 left in the first half. The Eagles got a Jake Elliott 30-yard field goal from the turnover.Saquon Barkley on the Eagles’ second drive, which resulted in a Jake Elliott 41-yard field goal. Barkley started the series with runs of 19 and 10 yards.Dallas Goedert’s nine-yard reception on third-and-nine at the Eagles’ 43 on the Eagles’ first drive of the game. It converted a third down, and was an encouraging start that quickly sagged with the fresh set of downs. Goedert came back for another big reception on a third-and-12 with a 13-yard catch to the Chargers’ 25, where the drive began to stall.Jalyx Hunt finished with 2.5 sacksand eight tackles.AdvertisementThe BadElliott missing the 48-yarder on the last play of the first half.Left guard Landon Dockerson limping off the field with just over two minutes left in the first half.Right guard Tyler Steen getting flagged for holding on first-and-10The Eagles’ opening drive.

Two of the four interceptions were deflected passes.Center Cam Jurgens holding call, which wiped out Hurts’ 18-yard scramble, forcing the Eagles into a third-and-16 in overtime.AdvertisementHurts missing Brown on the second play of overtime, sailing a pass on a second-and-six from the Eagles’ 34.Herbert leading the Chargers with 66 yards rushing, including numerous times when the Eagles completely forgot about him, like his 12-yard run on the first play in overtime. Herbert’s legs helped lead the Chargers to a 22-19 lead with 6:24 left in overtime.Hurts’ high pass to A.J. Brown, which should have been caught, with 11:03 left to play, and bounced off Brown’s hands and into the arms of the Chargers’ Cam Hart. It was Hurts’ third interception, which was more in one game than Hurts had thrown in his previous 12 games (2) combined. It led to Cameron Dicker’s third field goal and 16-16 tie with 7:26 to play.Ojomo getting called for leverage on the Chargers’ 36-yard field goal attempt on the Chargers’ first drive of the second half.Left tackle Jordan Mailata called for holding with 1:04 left in the first half, making a second-and-goal from the two, and second-and-goal from the 12. The penalty gutted the drive.AdvertisementThe Eagles’ first half offense. Hurtsthrew two interceptions, and the Eagles turned the ball over a total of three times. Over the last two games, Hurts has thrown three interceptions. In the Eagles’ first 11 games, he threw one.     Defensive end Moro Ojomo jumping offsides on the Cooper DeJean interception on the Chargers’ second drive.The Chargers first drive. They made it look easy, slicing through the Eagles for 80 yards over six plays, averaging 13.3 yards a play. On the six-play drive, the Chargers only faced one third down, with plays for 60, and 11 yards. The Eagles surrendering a 60-yard screen pass to Kimani Vidal on the Chargers first drive on a third-and-seven to the Eagles’ 17, before Zack Baun finally caught up to him.

Chelsea have THREE Premier League centre midfielders on the radar – two they would LOVE to sign!Unfortunately, as in life, greed has taken over completely in football these days and the players are just forced to play as much as possible to make sure they are playing in all competitions that are available, making big bosses more and more money, as well as the club, and eventually the players too of course. They all get paid very well.Chelsea played in the Club World Cup of course over the summer, which hasn’t really helped with fatigue amongst the squad due to not really getting a proper break in the summer time like many other clubs got.They are humans at the end of the day and not robots. They do need to rest.AdvertisementMaresca on Chelsea’s away formEnzo Maresca speaks about Chelsea’s game against Bournemouth.Speaking ahead of Chelsea’s next game in the Champions League tonight, which is away to Atalanta from Serie A in Italy, Maresca said:“In terms of playing away, we were more points away than at home in the Premier League. In the Champions League, as you said, we played two games, we drew and lost, but in the end I think it’s always things that balance out a bit at the end of the season.“As far as away games are concerned, I’m not saying we’re used to it, because it’s hard to get used to, but not just away games, because there’s no time between one game and the other. We played two days ago, we played two days before, but we’re trying to adapt.”",

(Photo by Judit Cartiel/Getty Images)AdvertisementThibaut Courtois and Antonio Rudiger were the two leaders who put their anger and disappointment to bed and faced the fans to convey their apologies on behalf of the team.The duo went around the stadium close to the fans, and their gesture did not go unnoticed by fans who appreciated their commitment to the team and leadership.In fact, the fans even handed them a round of applause for their affection and understanding.Notably, even Vinicius Jr stayed on the field for quite a long time after the game and gestured towards fans asking for forgiveness, although the Brazilian did not go around the stadium or get close to fans like the veteran duo.AdvertisementWhile Courtois and Rudiger’s gesture was indeed heart-warming, fans will expect an apology from the entire team when they take on Manchester City later this week – not through words but in action by delivering a strong performance.",

    "fullText": "Story byMyles SimmonsTue, December 9, 2025 at 7:01 AM UTC·2 min readIn the lead up to Monday night's matchup between the Eagles and Chargers, a report from ESPN indicated that Philadelphia head coach Nick Sirianni had been more involved in the team's offensive preparation.Sirianni had been more vocal in the team’s offensive meetings while also taking a larger role at the start of said meetings before turning things over to first-year coordinator Kevin Patullo.AdvertisementThe results didn’t work out for Philadelphia on Monday night, with Jalen Hurts turning in the first five-giveaway performance of his career in the 22-19 overtime loss. But Sirianni effectively confirmed the report after the game, adding that he’ll continue to spend more time with the offense.“I’m the head coach, so my attention goes to places that I feel like it needs to go,” Sirianni said. “This week was with the offense, and I’ll continue to go in there with those guys and grind it out through the weeds with them and continue to move forward with that.”Philadelphia finished with 365 total yards, 19 first downs, and 4-of-13 on third down. The club averaged 5.5 yards per play.But Hurts’ five turnovers undoubtedly derailed the offense.Advertisement“I thought we moved the ball and did a lot of good things today,” Sirianni said. “But we didn’t finish drives … for multiple reasons and had some turnovers for multiple reasons. So, you always look to improve the process and we’ll get back to work and grind out through it again. And, yeah, I anticipate being in there still.”Sirianni added that he doesn't anticipate making any more changes to roles, staffing, or personnel.\"We'll stay the course,\" Sirianni said.The Eagles will try to end their three-game losing streak on Sunday at home against the Raiders.",

    "fullText": "Story byLos Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert (10) looks to throw the ball during a NFL game against the Philadelphia Eagles on. Monday December 08, 2025 at Sofi Stadium in Inglewood, CA.Fredo CervantesTue, December 9, 2025 at 7:05 AM UTC·4 min readINGLEWOOD, Calif. — Monday Night Football in Los Angeles wasn’t a spectacle; it was a statement. A message sent across the league, across the AFC West, and directly to the defending Super Bowl champions. In front of a sold-out, electric SoFi Stadium, the Chargers outlasted the Philadelphia Eagles 22–19 in overtime—moving to 5–0 on primetime and 4–0 in the AFC West behind a performance equal parts chaotic, resilient, and cinematic.And no one seemed to appreciate the theater more than the head coach.Advertisement“I put it in the discussion with the birth of my seven children, my marriage,” Jim Harbaugh said after the win.He wasn’t joking. Monday night was that kind of night.TONY MF JEFFERSON FOR THE WIN\n\n📺 | @espn pic.twitter.com/CGetSizPGW— Los Angeles Chargers (@chargers) December 9, 2025Just seven days removed from surgery on his non-throwing hand, Justin Herbert walked into SoFi looking like a quarterback held together by tape and willpower. He walked out with yet another game-winning drive—and his coach comparing him to an action-movie lead.“It felt like we were in a movie where you go, ‘OK, this is getting a little unrealistic,’” Harbaugh said. “He just refuses to lose. He’s a superhero quarterback.”Herbert now sits at 29 game-winning drives, second only to Patrick Mahomes since 2020.AdvertisementIt wasn’t a glamorous box score night. Herbert went through seven sacks—a career high—and an offense that sputtered for long stretches. But when the Chargers needed their quarterback, bandaged hand and all, No. 10 delivered yet again: a late fourth-quarter march to set up the tying field goal, and a poised overtime drive to put the Chargers ahead for good.And afterward? Herbert made sure the spotlight was shared.“As soon as I met [Harbaugh], I knew he was a special coach,” Herbert said. The respect runs deep—and the results show it.\nIf Herbert was the heart of the Chargers on Monday, the returning rookie was the jolt of electricity.AdvertisementWelcome back, Omarion Hampton.Out since Week 5 with an ankle injury, Hampton stepped back onto an NFL field like someone who’d been waiting impatiently to hit “resume.” On the opening drive, he caught a touchdown to give the Chargers a 7–0 lead—and the Hampton-Vidal duo accounted for all 80 yards on the drive.Kimani Vidal: 60-yard catch. Omarion Hampton: touchdown. Two-headed monster: unlocked.Hampton finished with 56 yards on 13 carries; Vidal added 44 on 14. Not gaudy stats, but tone-setting, punishing, clock-consuming football that kept the Eagles on their heels.Welcome back Omarion Hampton!\n\nLA leads 7-0 with 8:49 in the 1Q@SportingTrib pic.twitter.com/5adp3bCZxh— Fredo Cervantes (@FredoCervantes) December 9, 2025This game, messy as it was, belonged to the Chargers’ defense.AdvertisementThey held the defending champs to a single touchdown all night. They forced five turnovers from Jalen Hurts. They swarmed. They hit. They punched right back every time Philadelphia tried to land momentum.The opening defensive stand set the tone: Odafe Oweh’s third-down sack forced a punt. From there, the Bolts' defense went to work:Da’Shawn Hand intercepted Hurts in the second quarter, triggering one of the wildest turnovers of the season: a Hand pick, Hand fumble, Hurts fumble, Troy Dye recovery.They held Hurts to 21-of-40, 240 yards, zero touchdowns, and four interceptions.They forced Philadelphia into four field goals, refusing to break, no matter how many times they were backed up.AdvertisementAnd then—when everything hung in the balance—they delivered the dagger.\nWith the Eagles driving in overtime and on the brink of ending it, Cam Hart got his hand up. The ball popped loose. Veteran Tony Jefferson, in his words, “just made the play off the tip.”“Cam Hart came in with great awareness,” Jefferson said. “I couldn’t have done it without him. Teamwork.”Ballgame.Cameron Dicker has ice in his veins. In regulation: a 46-yarder with eight seconds left to force OT. In overtime: a 54-yard strike to give the Chargers the lead.Three second-half field goals. Perfect under pressure. Heavy lifting done.\nAnd yet, the Eagles nearly answered—until the defense slammed the door shut for good.AdvertisementThis wasn’t clean football. The Chargers had only five first downs in the first half. Herbert threw a pick. The offensive line struggled. Both teams combined for six turnovers by halftime.But sometimes, great teams win ugly. Elite teams win ugly against elite opponents. Champions win ugly when the moment demands it.And on Monday night, the Chargers showed something Harbaugh has been preaching since Day One: toughness, unity, and a refusal to fold.“This one,” Harbaugh said, “is in the conversation.”If Monday night was a movie, it wasn’t a polished blockbuster. It was a gritty, chaotic, heart-stopping thriller. And at the end? The Chargers walked out heroes.",

    "fullText": "Story byRichard Hughes makes the BIGGEST mistake of Mo Salah sagaAnfield WatchTue, December 9, 2025 at 7:05 AM UTC·4 min readLiverpool’s current treatment of Mohamed Salah makes the club’s decision to renew his contract all the more baffling. Salah’s previous deal was due to expire in summer 2025. And the player’s desire to get another contract may have acted as the ultimate incentive.AdvertisementHe produced the greatest individual season in Premier League history - winning the top scorer, playmaker and player of the year awards. That concluded a clean sweep of the player prizes for Salah - who was then rewarded with a lucrative new deal.Current estimates place the contract at £400k per week - plus bonuses - until summer 2027.That means Liverpool committed to over £40m in salary to Salah - an eye-watering sum for any player and second only to Erling Haaland in the Premier League’s most-paid list.However, Haaland is only 25 whereas Salah is 33. He will be 35 by the time his contract runs out. There aren’t many forwards in that pay bracket in world football - with the exceptions of Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo.AdvertisementAnd to be perfectly frank about those two - they are in semi-retirement when it comes to the club game.Salah unhappy at Liverpool this seasonSalah is not a one-man show; the kind of player to solve problems by himself. Like any forward he needs supply and he needs support. Liverpool hollowed his out over the summer - with Trent Alexander-Arnold, Darwin Nunez and Luis Diaz leaving.Salah has gone on record about how much he loved playing with Nunez - while analysis has shown that the Egyptian King is missing Trent and Diaz more than anyone else.Right now - when he plays - Salah is struggling to get the ball in the same kind of positions that he did when Trent was around. He is spending less time in the opposition penalty area and taking fewer shots.AdvertisementThe numbers he is producing in this context are respectable - he remains among Liverpool’s most productive forwards for goals and assists.Certainly compared to Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, Salah’s numbers still stack up favourably.But right now it looks ever more clear that the time to say goodbye was last summer. The new contract was a reward for what Salah did in 2024/25 and not a predictor for how he would fare through to 2027.He should have been told there’s no renewal - much like Manchester City did with Kevin De Bruyne - who despite a stellar career was never going to get a new deal on the wages he desired.AdvertisementSalah leaving for Afcon and playing in World Cup tooSalah could have left with the perfect farewell - as a champion entitled to pick his next destination and his legendary status secured. And when you consider the load on Salah in this current campaign a parting of the ways makes even more sense.He is due to to play the Africa Cup of Nations - starting in only a matter of days - and that could wipe out his involvement for up to a month and a bit.That’s about £2m he’s earning for no work at all. And then there’s the FIFA World Cup next summer. Owing to what happened in 2018 - where he was brutally injured just before the tournament began - Salah needs a brilliant campaign for the Pharaohs.AdvertisementHis focus will no doubt be on international matters at various times for the next six months - and when he returns from the North American tournament he will be exhausted.Salah will then have to face into a final season - as a 34-year-old winger in need of a rest.© Anfield WatchNo way back after Salah interviewThe renewal only really makes sense if you consider that Liverpool wanted to get rid of him at the earliest possible juncture - thereby earning some money back.The club got plenty of money from Saudi Arabia for the likes of Nunez and Fabinho in previous seasons and were probably hopeful of doing the same with Salah - perhaps as early as January.AdvertisementThe renewal is not working out for anyone.Slot cannot get the best out of him and indeed looks like he’s making Salah carry the can for the team’s poor form.Salah’s burned his bridges as a result of his interview on Saturday. And the club’s negotiating position will have been weakened as interested teams will know for certain he wants out.The last player of Salah’s vintage to move to Saudi was Ronaldo - but Al-Nassr paid NO fee for him as the player had his Manchester United deal cancelled.Liverpool will be hoping Salah’s future won’t play out the same. Following the Brighton game on Saturday we will have a much clearer picture.From this vantage point however it looks like a mistake to have signed up the Egyptian King for a new deal.",

    "description": "Salah has been omitted from Liverpool’s squad to play Inter Milan in the Champions League after the forward claimed he has been thrown ‘under the bus’",
    "fullText": "Story byJamie BraidwoodTue, December 9, 2025 at 7:04 AM UTC·6 min readJamie Carragher has responded to Mohamed Salah’s bombshell Liverpool interview by calling his comments a “disgrace”, accusing the star forward of trying to get head coach Arne Slot sacked and only thinking about “me, me, me”.In a stunning rebuke of one of Liverpool’s greatest ever players, who Carragher said would go down in history as a Liverpool legend, the former defender and Sky Sports pundit reminded Salah that he had won nothing before arriving at Anfield and that football is not about the “individual”.Carragher was name-checked by Salah as the Liverpool forward made his explosive comments (Getty Images)During a rare exchange with reporters on Saturday, Salah claimed Liverpool have thrown him “under the bus” and said his relationship with Slot had broken down after he was left on the bench during the draw at Leeds. Salah has now been left out of the squad to face Inter Milan on Tuesday.AdvertisementCarragher and Salah have exchanged words previously. The former Liverpool defender had called on Salah to be a more of a “leader” just two weeks ago and accused the 33-year-old of only ever speaking out when it suits him.Sensing further criticism from Carragher as he spoke to the media at Elland Road, Salah name-checked the pundit and said: “Tomorrow Carragher is going to go for me again and again and that’s fine.”Carragher says he does not like criticising Salah because of his immense contribution to Liverpool’s recent success but last week claimed that the forward’s “legs have gone”, along with captain Virgil van Dijk’s.Salah, who is Liverpool’s third-highest scorer of all time with 250 goals, appeared to take that criticism personally and referenced England striker Harry Kane as he explained why he feels he is not shown more respect.AdvertisementAnd on Sky Sports’ Monday Night Football, Carragher defended his criticism of Salah as he declared: “I will go after Salah when he tries to throw my club under the bus”.“I thought it was a disgrace what he did after the game,” Carragher said on Sky Sports. “Some people have painted it as an emotional outburst. I don’t think it was. I think whenever Mo Salah stops in a mixed zone, which he’s done four times in eight years at Liverpool, it’s choreographed with him and his agent to cause maximum damage and strengthen his own position.“He did that 12 months ago and I called him out on it. He played on the heartstrings of the Liverpool supporters. Liverpool were top of the league, he’d scored the winning goal at Southampton and that was the time to come out and put on the pressure on the Liverpool ownership.“He’s chose this weekend to do this, and he’s waited I think to choose a bad result for Liverpool. Supporters, the manager, everyone at the club feels like they’re in the gutter and he’s chosen that time to go for the manager and maybe get him sacked.Carragher accused Salah of lashing out when Liverpool are in the ‘gutter’ (PA Wire)“The one line that stands out for me is ‘thrown under the bus’. He’s thrown the club under the bus twice in the last 12 months. With the manager right now, he should be doing as much as he can to help the club get out of the worst run they’ve had since the 1950s and he hasn’t done that.”AdvertisementCarragher accepted that star players such as Salah don’t expect to be on the bench and are upset when they are, but he blasted the 33-year-old’s “ego” and reminded him that football is a team sport. In April, Salah was awarded a lucrative two-year contract after firing Liverpool to the Premier League title in a record-breaking campaign, but he has only scored five goals this season and Liverpool have won only four of their last 15 games, losing nine.“You talk about the ego of these types of players, Ronaldo, Messi, Mbappe, Salah. I think they have a feeling that the success of a football club is down to them,” Carragher said. “It then becomes a problem when you’re in a situation like this. When Mo Salah’s talking about how many goals he’s scored, ‘I’ve got more than anyone else in the Premier League’, he’s always talking about himself.Carragher says Salah is a Liverpool ‘legend’ but is upset at his behaviour (PA Wire)“I’d remind Salah and his agent that before he came to Liverpool he was known as the man who failed at Chelsea. He’d never won a major trophy before he came to Liverpool. He's also the greatest player ever in Egypt. Egypt are the most successful country in the Africa Cup of Nations [Afcon] and he's going there in a couple of weeks.Advertisement“Salah’s never won the Afcon. That’s not me trying to put him down as a player. He’s one of the best players in the world over the last eight years, very few better. But, what it tells Salah and his agent is that it’s not about an individual.“You weren’t a big star before you came to Liverpool. You haven’t won anything with Egypt. All that’s saying is no matter how good a player you are, you need help from your team-mates, your manager and fans. I think it’s really important that he remembers that. When he’s talking after the game, all it’s about is me, me, me.”Carragher said Salah was known as the player who ‘failed at Chelsea’ before joining Liverpool (Getty Images)Carragher also called Salah’s defending “embarrassing” this season, explaining why Slot has dropped the forward during Liverpool’s struggles, and added: “Have I ever criticised Mo Salah on the pitch? I don't class that [legs gone comment as criticism], that's something that happens for every player, I've never criticised him for not working back, not passing to somebody. He's a legend, you have to put up with certain things.Advertisement“Some of the criticism has been excessive, but I will go after Salah when he tries to throw my club under the bus. Let's understand Arne Slot, he's conceded 10 goals in three games, Salah was embarrassing against PSV. West Ham away, we need to keep a clean sheet, you take the one player out of your side you have allowed not to defend.“You play Sunderland at home, I'd have played him, but it's understandable, he brings him on at half-time. West Ham away and Leeds away, why would you bring him on when you're winning those games? You don't need a goal. You're bringing on a guy who can't defend set pieces and doesn't track back.”",

But their eight-point tally keeps them firmly in the seeded play-off spots and only two points shy of automatic qualification.A return to home soil for the game against Slavia Prague should give Spurs the ideal opportunity to return to winning ways in the Champions League.They’ve won both their home games so far, seeing off Villarreal and Copenhagen without conceding.AdvertisementTottenham’s remarkable 22-match unbeaten run in European home games remains intact, and they are just one goal short of reaching 100 in the competition.Having snapped their dreadful home run in the Premier League with a 2-0 win against Brentford over the weekend, Spurs will back themselves to get the job done later tonight.How Tottenham could line upFrank could make up to four changes for the game against Slavia Prague as they look to close the gap further to the top eight.Guglielmo Vicario will be looking for a third straight home clean sheet in the Champions League when Slavia Prague come visiting, but the back four could see a minor tweak.AdvertisementWhile Djed Spence, Micky van de Ven, and Pedro Porro reprise their roles, Kevin Danso could come in for Cristian Romero, who should be handed a breather.Joao Palhinha should come in to anchor the midfield alongside “unstoppable” Lucas Bergvall, in place of Rodrigo Bentancur and Archie Gray.Wilson Odobert may step in for Randal Kolo Muani while Xavi Simons, Mohammed Kudus, and Richarlison spearhead the attack.",

    "fullText": "Story byHow Liverpool could line up in Champions League clash vs Inter Milan (4-2-3-1)SportsViewTue, December 9, 2025 at 7:10 AM UTC·2 min readLiverpool have been on a rollercoaster Champions League campaign so far. One week, they were celebrating a cathartic victory over long-time rivals Real Madrid.The next, Anfield was stunned into silence as PSV Eindhoven handed the Reds a 4-1 defeat – a result that matched an unwelcome record dating back nearly a century.AdvertisementIt was Liverpool’s third home defeat by three goals or more this season, something not seen since 1929-30, and it left them in 13th place, although they’re just one point off the top eight.There have been a few signs of Liverpool returning to their old selves. Since the historic defeat to PSV, they’re unbeaten in three games. But even that run came with caveats.A comprehensive 2-0 win at West Ham United hinted at a potential resurgence, but it has quickly faded with disappointing draws against newly-promoted duo Sunderland and Leeds United.Saturday’s six-goal thriller at Elland Road drove a dagger through the heart of Liverpool fans as the Reds conceded a last-minute equaliser.AdvertisementBut no one could have predicted what happened later as unused substitute Mohamed Salah stole the headlines with an extraordinary rant claiming that the club had “thrown him under the bus”.Unsurprisingly, he has been left out of the squad to face Inter, but whether Liverpool can put the drama behind them and get the job done at San Siro is a different question entirely.How Liverpool could line upSalah’s omission has caught the headlines, but manager Arne Slot could still raise a few eyebrows as he makes four changes to the side that drew Leeds.Alisson hardly justified his enormous wages at the weekend, so Giorgio Mamardashvilli could be given a chance to prove he can step in for the Brazilian efficiently.AdvertisementIbrahima Konate has been in the firing line recently and could make way for Joe Gomez to partner Virgil van Dijk at centre-back.Andrew Robertson will likely come in for Milos Kerkez while Conor Bradley retains his spot at right back.Ryan Gravenberch has formed a new partnership with Curtis Jones in midfield, while Dominik Szoboszlai and Florian Wirtz should also keep their place.But a surprise tweak could see Hugo Ekitike shifted to the left in place of Cody Gakpo to accommodate British record striker Alexander Isak.",

    "fullText": "Story byRoma decide to send Evan Ferguson back to BrightonRomaPressTue, December 9, 2025 at 7:07 AM UTC·1 min readThe story between Evan Ferguson and Roma appears to be coming to an early end.There are four games left until the winter transfer window, and barring any surprises, the Irish striker is expected to return to Brighton as early as January.AdvertisementAt Trigoria, the decision is practically final: Ferguson’s experience is considered a failed gamble, and the need to free up a spot in the squad for the arrival of a new striker has further accelerated the deliberations.As reported by La Gazzetta dello Sport, initial contacts with Brighton have already taken place, and it’s no coincidence that the English club’s manager, Fabian Hürzeler, has opened up to the possibility of bringing him back, also considering Tzimas’ injury, which will keep him out for some time.However, in addition to Roma’s willingness, the club that owns him will also be needed to terminate the loan early.Roma has a clear need: to free up a position in the attacking department before finalizing the signing of a new center forward. Given that Dovbyk represents a strategic investment and unlikely to be sold in the January transfer window, the most viable solution remains Ferguson’s early return. In this scenario, sporting director Massara is ready for the next step.AdvertisementThree names are on the table to strengthen the defense: Joshua Zirkzee, listed as the first choice, Gianluca Scamacca, and Arnaud Kalimuendo. Further back, but not excluded, are Raspadori and Tel, considered for a deeper role in the attacking midfield. The move has begun, now we wait for the circle to close.",

    "description": "ABC has aired Kimmel's late-night show since 2003, during a time of upheaval in the industry and, recently, much criticism from President Trump.",
    "fullText": "President Donald Trump won’t be getting his wish. ABC said Monday it has signed late-night comic Jimmy Kimmel to a one-year contract extension.Recommended VideoKimmel’s previous, multiyear contract had been set to expire next May, so the extension will keep him on the air until at least May 2027.Kimmel’s future looked questionable in September, when ABC suspended “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” for remarks made following the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk. Following a public outcry, ABC lifted the suspension, and Kimmel returned to the air with much stronger ratings than he had before.He continued his relentless joking at the president’s expense, leading Trump to urge the network to “get the bum off the air” in a social media post last month. The post followed Kimmel’s nearly 10-minute monologue on Trump and the Jeffrey Epstein files.Kimmel was even on Trump’s mind Sunday as the president hosted the Kennedy Center Honors in Washington.“I’ve watched some of the people that host,” Trump said. “I’ve watched some of the people that host. Jimmy Kimmel was horrible, and some of these people, if I can’t beat out Jimmy Kimmel in terms of talent, then I don’t think I should be president.”Kimmel has hosted the Oscars four times, but he’s never hosted the Kennedy Center show.Just last week, Kimmel was needling Trump on the president’s approval ratings. “There are gas stations on Yelp with higher approval ratings than Trump right now,” he said.Kimmel will be staying longer than late-night colleague Stephen Colbert at CBS. The network announced this summer it was ending Colbert’s show next May for economic reasons, even though it is the top-rated network show in late-night television.ABC has aired Kimmel’s late-night show since 2003, during a time of upheaval in the industry. Like much of broadcast television, late-night ratings are down. Viewers increasingly turn to watching monologues online the day after they appear.Most of Kimmel’s recent renewals have been multiyear extensions. There was no immediate word on whose choice it was to extend his current contract by one year.Bill Carter, author of “The Late Shift” and veteran chronicler of late-night TV, cautioned against reading too much into the length of the extension. Kimmel, at age 58, knows he’s getting close to the end of the line, Carter said, but when he leaves, he doesn’t want it to appear under pressure from Trump or anyone.“He wants to make sure that it’s on his terms,” Carter said.Kimmel has become one of the leading voices resisting Trump. “I think it’s important for him and for ABC that they are standing up for him,” Carter said.Following Kirk’s killing, Kimmel was criticized for saying that “the MAGA gang” was “desperately trying to characterize this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and doing everything they can to score political points from it.” The Nexstar and Sinclair television ownership groups said it would take Kimmel off the air, leading to ABC’s suspension.When he returned to the air, Kimmel did not apologize for his remarks, but he said he did not intend to blame any specific group for Kirk’s assassination. He said “it was never my intention to make the light of the murder of a young man.”",

    "description": "The AI coding-assistant start-up isn't just using artificial intelligence to help developers write code, it's deploying AI across its own internal operations, CEO Michael Truell said at Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.",
    "fullText": "AI coding-assistant start-up Cursor isn’t just using artificial intelligence to help developers write code, it’s deploying AI across its own internal operations, CEO, Michael Truell, told the audience at Fortune’s Brainstorm AI in San Francisco.Recommended VideoTruell said the company had already automated roughly 80% of its customer support tickets with the help of the technology. He said the company had also implemented an internal AI-powered communication system that allows employees to query information across the organization. “We’ve actually done a lot of work internally on customizing that setup,” he said.Cursor also uses AI for internal communications, he said. “We have a system where folks can ask any question about the company and get it answered by an AI,” Truell said, as well as an project with “a few forward deployed engineers internally embedded throughout, building custom tooling right now for operations, for sales and experimenting,” he said. Across the enterprise software landscape, some larger organizations are increasingly coming up against adoption challenges when attempting to integrate AI into workflows. Data silos—where information is trapped in disconnected systems—prevent AI tools from accessing the full context they need to be useful, and technical sprawl—the accumulation of disparate tools and platforms over years of growth— can create integration issues. Many organizations are finding they need more dedicated technical expertise to help tailor AI models to specific business needs.Engineers are seeing productivity gainsCursor, which is valued at $29.3 billion, said last month it had crossed $1 billion in annualized revenue and now has more than 300 employees. The company has seen rapid growth since it was founded by a team of four MIT graduates in 2022. The company’s AI coding tool, which first launched in 2023, has been popular with software who use it to help both generate and edit code. There has been some conflicting research about how helpful AI tools actually are for software engineering. A July 2025 study by the nonprofit research group METR found that experienced developers working on large, mature codebases actually took 19% longer to complete tasks when using AI tools such as Cursor and Claude, despite believing they had worked 20% faster. The researchers attributed the slowdown to time spent prompting AI, waiting for responses, and time reviewing generated code.A recent study conducted by University of Chicago found that teams using Cursor’s AI coding assistant in large companies merged 39% more pull requests (PRs) compared to non-users. The research also showed that senior developers created more detailed plans before writing code and demonstrated greater skill working with AI agents.“A lot of folks think that junior developers get the most out of AI,” Truell said. But “when these academics went in and looked at the data, it looked like senior engineers actually were more effective in using the tools and were accepting code at higher rates and were getting more value from that.”Truell noted that this surprised him as well: “We want to dig into to understand exactly why that’s the case.”",

PepsiCo said it will use the savings to invest in marketing and improved value for consumers.

    "description": "Warner \"did not provide a single markup of a single transaction document\" or engage in any back-and-forth negotiation for months, its jilted suitor said.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance’s tender offer for Warner Bros. Discovery emerged from months of fitful courtship, a shifting media landscape, and a high‑stakes bidding war that ultimately pitted the studio behind “Top Gun: Maverick” against streaming giant Netflix for control of one of Hollywood’s crown jewels. The company’s tender offer regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed hours after Paramount launched a hostile bid worth $108 billion (or $77.9 billion in equity), laid out a detailed chronology in which Paramount repeatedly tried to lure Warner Bros., to no avail. Netflix and Warner Bros. agreed a deal worth nearly $83 billion ($72 billion in equity) on Friday.Recommended VideoThe filing revealed Paramount CEO’s last-ditch text message to WBD counterpart David Zaslav at roughly 4pm ET on December 4, the day before Netflix ultimately announced its deal, as previously reported by the Financial Times. “Daivd [sic], I appreciate you’re underwater today so I wanted to send you a quick text. Please note when you next meet as a board we wanted to offer you a package that addressed all of the issues you discussed we [sic] me,” David Ellison wrote as he apparently felt his target slipping away.“Also please know despite the noise of the last 24 hours I have nothing but respect and admiration for you and the company,” Ellison added. “It would be the honor of a lifetime to be your partner and to be the owner of these iconic assets. If we have the privilege to work together you will see that my father and I are the people you had dinner with. We are always loyal and honorable to our partners and hope we have the opportunity to prove that to you. Best, David.” Later that day, Paramount sent Zaslav a letter criticizing a “tainted” sale process.Paramount told investors today that it continued to believe it was never taken seriously. “During the entirety of the sale ‘process’ undertaken by the Warner Bros. Board, representatives of Warner Bros. did not provide a single markup of a single transaction document, have a single meeting to go page-by-page through the documents, or engage in a ‘real time’ back-and-forth negotiation with Paramount or its advisors.”Early outreach in 2023In 2023 and 2024, Paramount’s predecessor, Paramount Global, and Warner Bros. held intermittent talks about a possible merger, but those conversations ended without a deal as Paramount Global moved instead to merge with Skydance, under the control of current CEO Ellison. After that transaction closed in August 2025, Paramount’s new leadership revisited the idea of combining with Warner Bros., concluding that a tie‑up could create a stronger, scaled competitor to streaming platforms and big technology companies, according to the SEC filing.​The urgency increased in June 2025 when Warner Bros. publicly unveiled plans to split itself in two, targeting completion by mid‑2026, a strategy it continued to defend through early autumn. Paramount believed this breakup would destroy value and make any future full-company acquisition far harder, so it decided to move quickly, seeing a narrow window to buy all of Warner Bros. before the separation took effect.​Paramount’s escalating proposalsBy early September 2025, the filing noted, media reports surfaced that Paramount was preparing an offer, helping push Warner Bros.’ share price sharply higher from a pre‑rumor closing price of $12.54—it was trading at $19.46 by September 15, the day after Paramount offered $19 per share in cash and stock.​ (The New York Times reported on the secret bids from Paramount in October.)Warner Bros. rejected that approach within days, saying the bid undervalued the company and that its own breakup plan promised better long‑term value. Paramount responded on September 30 with an improved offer worth $22 a share, primarily in cash, and went further on deal protections, including a $2 billion termination fee and a commitment to litigate to secure antitrust clearance, while also dangling roles for Zaslav as co-CEO and co-Chairman of the board of the combined company.​Warner Bros. rebuffed this proposal as well, again calling it inadequate and insisting its planned separation remained superior, a stance that only hardened Paramount’s view that the board was underestimating the industrial logic of a combination. In October, Warner Bros. publicly announced a wider review of “strategic alternatives,” signaling that it would run a formal sale process and had received interest from multiple parties in both the whole company and specific assets such as its streaming arm.​Paramount attempted to enter that process on more favorable terms, pushing back on an initial Warner Bros. confidentiality agreement that included a lengthy standstill, tight controls on financing contacts and waivers of potential legal claims about the sale. Its advisers negotiated for a shorter standstill, “most‑favored‑nation” treatment versus other bidders, and freedom to challenge the process if Warner Bros. ultimately retreated to its separation plan, underscoring deep mistrust over how the auction might be run.​Due diligence and financing ramp-upAs the process unfolded, Paramount was granted limited access to a virtual data room, which it viewed as “sparsely populated” given the size and complexity of a potential deal. In mid‑November, Warner Bros. hosted an in‑person management presentation in California, while antitrust lawyers for both sides met to assess regulatory risks and lay out arguments that a Paramount–Warner Bros. merger would be pro‑competitive in a market dominated by tech‑backed streaming giants.​Parallel to those talks, Paramount’s board set up a special committee of independent directors to vet a large equity infusion from the Ellison family and private‑equity firm RedBird. Paramount also locked in a $54 billion senior secured bridge facility led by Wall Street banks.A bidding war with NetflixOn November 20, Paramount submitted another improved proposal, lifting its implied offer to $25.50 a share, heavily weighted to cash and backed by signed debt commitments and promised equity. That bid included a $5 billion regulatory reverse breakup fee and more aggressive litigation undertakings, signaling Paramount’s willingness to fight regulators if required to close the transaction.​ (Netflix committed to a $5.8 billion breakup fee in its winning bid, which Bloomberg reported is among the highest of all time.)Even as Paramount sweetened its terms, public commentary suggested some influential Warner Bros. figures saw Netflix as a more attractive partner, particularly for its pure‑play streaming focus and global reach. During a particular November 13 interview on CNBC, WBD chairman emeritus John Malone questioned Paramount’s intervention and discussed the merits of a Netflix deal, adding to market speculation that Warner Bros. leadership might prefer a streaming‑first tie‑up over a legacy‑studio merger.​Netflix deal and Paramount’s pivot to a tenderThe process culminated on December 4, 2025, when Warner Bros. signed a merger agreement with Netflix that would see Netflix acquire Warner Bros.’ streaming businesses after a complicated internal reorganization and spin‑off of other assets. That deal offered cash and Netflix stock with headline value of about $27.75 per share but included adjustments tied to spin‑off net debt and a 21‑month outer closing date.​Paramount responded the same day with what it calls its “Prior Proposal,” a merger agreement valuing Warner Bros. at $30 a share in straight cash, with what it argues are stronger regulatory commitments, a shorter outside date and no price haircut tied to balance‑sheet mechanics. When Warner Bros. nevertheless chose the Netflix deal, Paramount concluded that the board had opted for an “obviously financially inferior transaction with extraordinary regulatory risk and a longer timeline to a possible closing,” and decided its only route was to go directly to shareholders.​Calls to Paramount, WBD, and Netflix to comment on the events as laid out in the filing were not immediately returned. We will update this post with any response.Editor’s note: the author worked for Netflix from June 2024 through July 2025.For this story, Fortune journalists used generative AI as a research tool.

Those chips, called Blackwell and the upcoming Rubin, were not part of what Trump approved.Trump said on social media that he had informed China’s leader Xi Jinping about his decision and “President Xi responded positively!”“This policy will support American Jobs, strengthen U.S. Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers,” Trump said in his post.Nvidia said in a statement that it applauded Trump’s decision, saying the choice would support domestic manufacturing and that by allowing the Commerce Department to vet commercial customers it would “strike a thoughtful balance” on economic and national security priorities.Trump said the Commerce Department was “finalizing the details” for other chipmakers such as AMD and Intel to sell their technologies abroad.The approval of the licenses to sell Nvidia H200 chips reflects the increasing power and close relationship that the company’s founder and CEO, Jensen Huang, enjoys with the president. But there have been concerns that China will find ways to use the chips to develop its own AI products in ways that could pose national security risks for the U.S., a primary concern of the Biden administration that sought to limit exports.Nvidia has a market cap of $4.5 trillion and Trump’s announcement appeared to drive the stock slightly higher in after hours trading.",

    "title": "Amazon robotaxi service Zoox to start charging for rides in 2026, with ‘laser focus’ on transporting people, not deliveries, says cofounder",
    "description": "Jesse Levinson, Zoox cofounder and CTO, said the robotaxi service needs several more years before it can operate at a scale where the business is “financially interesting.”",
    "fullText": "Amazon’s self-driving robotaxi subsidiary, Zoox, expects to start charging passengers for rides in Las Vegas in early 2026, with paid rides in the San Francisco Bay Area coming later next year, a company executive said Monday. Recommended VideoThe move, which would represent a key milestone for Zoox as it seeks to catch up with Alphabet’s Waymo, depends on obtaining federal regulatory and state approvals, Zoox cofounder and chief technology officer Jesse Levinson told the audience at the Fortune Brainstorm AI event in San Francisco on Monday.And while robotaxi rival Waymo recently partnered with DoorDash to test food deliveries with driverless cars, Levinson said that Zoox is “laser focused” on moving people around cities, an addressable market he sees as being “just profoundly huge.” That directive has come “all the way from the very top” at Amazon, he added, despite the retailer’s significant interest in driverless package delivery.“It’s harder to move people around than packages in terms of what you have to do with your vehicle,” Levinson said. On the other hand, automating package delivery is rife with its own challenges because the boxes have to get in and out of the vehicle, which isn’t as straightforward as people who can move themselves, he added.Zoox crossed the 1 million mile technical threshold for autonomous rides just last week, Levinson said. The company’s distinct, carriage-seated vehicles, which have no steering wheels or manual controls, currently provide rides to passengers free of charge in portions of Las Vegas, and Zoox is slowly opening up the wait list to use the service in San Francisco.Despite the progress and the plans to start charging fares, Zoox won’t generate revenues that are meaningful to Amazon, its $2.4 trillion parent company, for at least several more years, Levinson said. “This is pretty expensive,” said Levinson. “Over the next few years, it will start to be a really interesting business because the revenue you can generate from the robotaxi is quite a bit more than the expense to run robotaxis.” That’s the point at which the business will become more “financially interesting,” he added. Building cars without human drivers in mindWhile creating a driverless robotaxi service comes with various challenges, Levinson believes it will ultimately be a key method for moving people around dense urban areas.“Our view is that people aren’t doing this, not because it’s not a good idea, but because it’s just really hard,” said Levinson. “It takes a lot of time, it’s very cross-functional, and it’s expensive. But I do think over time this is going to be a much more popular way of human transportation.”One of the gaps between a driverless robotaxi service like Zoox and Waymo, said Levinson, is in the way the cars are built. Rather than retrofitted vehicles that were manufactured with a human driver in mind, Zoox cars were built to be driverless. Levinson said the four-passenger cabins have carriage seating, active suspension, individual screens for each seat, and four-zone climate control. “The cars that have been designed over the last 100 years are for humans,” Levinson said. “All the choices, their shape, their architecture, what components they have in them—they were all designed for human drivers.” Levinson said Zoox offers a more cushy, social rider experience that he thinks will be a differentiator among competitors like Waymo and potentially Tesla’s robotaxi fleet. Another competitive element for Zoox is its battery, said Levinson. The bigger battery is more environmentally and economically friendly because it requires less charging.“The economic opportunity and the opportunity for customers [as we] create this whole new category of transportation is actually much more exciting and even more financially compelling than simply taking something they do today and saving a bit of money,” he said.",

    "title": "Netflix CEO brushes aside Paramount’s ‘entirely expected’ hostile bid, ‘super confident’ of closing deal with Warner Bros. Discovery",
    "description": "The Netflix Co-CEO also said he's talked with the president \"many times\" since the election and he'll be good to movie theaters once he’s running a studio.",
    "fullText": "After announcing an almost-$83 billion deal to buy most of Warner Bros. Discovery on Friday, Netflix’s top brass projected calm on Monday as Paramount Skydance lobbed a hostile bid to purchase all of WBD,  and investors seemed to recoil at the sheer size of Netflix’s own offer.Recommended Video“Today’s move was entirely expected,” Co-CEO Ted Sarandos told investors at a UBS conference, brushing off Paramount’s bid just hours earlier. “We have a deal done, and we are incredibly happy with the deal. We think it’s great for our shareholders. It’s great for consumers. We think it’s a great way to create and protect jobs in the entertainment industry.” From Netflix’s perspective, Sarandos added, “We have a deal done, and we’re incredibly happy with the deal.”Sarandos’s co-CEO, Greg Peters, then walked the audience through Netflix’s three-phase plan to wring value from Warner Bros. and HBO. If the deal goes through, he said, Netflix would turbocharge licensing opportunities, “double down” on the HBO brand, and unlock upsides from Warner Bros’ vast library of IP, which many analysts consider a “crown jewel” in the industry. The executives’ comments came after investors sent Netflix stock tumbling down 6% in the two trading sessions since its Warner deal was announced, with some analysts blasting the $82.7 billion deal as “exorbitant” and “very risky.” Netflix stock is down more than 20% over the last six months.Peters acknowledged that Netflix is known as a builder, not a buyer—generally developing its own intellectual property, rather than purchasing other companies’: “We haven’t done this before,” he said. But the company that started out lending DVDs by mail has pivoted several times to become the more than $400-billion behemoth now challenging Hollywood’s order.And it’s worth noting that Netflix began streaming other companies’ content before it began producing its own programming. Its licensing operations are still vaunted in the industry, with the famous example of the legal drama Suits becoming a smash hit several years after it stopped airing on cable TV. As Peter put it: “Essentially, we are constantly in the business of evaluating various different licensing opportunities for titles and then trying to figure out, how do we maximize the value of that asset on our platform?” The Warner deal will just make official what Netflix already does, day in and day out.”Netflix’s deal announcement on Friday rattled many in Hollywood, including creators and their unions, and movie theater owners, whose trade organization called it an “unprecedented threat” to their business. Sarandos, the executive behind the model that made “Netflix and chill” a byword for the millennial dating practice of and binging shows and movies at home, has largely refused to release movies in theaters, except to qualify for awards. At an event earlier this year, Sarandos dismissed going to the movies as “an outmoded idea for most people” and said Netflix was “saving Hollywood” with its stream-at-home model.But on Monday he extended an olive branch to theater owners, saying of theatrical releases “We didn’t buy this company to destroy that value.” “What we are going to do with this is we’re deeply committed to releasing those movies exactly the way they’ve released those movies today,” he said at the UBS conference. “When this deal closes, we are in that business, and we’re going to do it.” Sarandos also discussed his conversations with President Donald Trump—which Bloomberg reported over the weekend began in November. President Trump “cares deeply about American industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,” Sarandos said. Jobs were the president’s main concern, according to Sarandos, who reeled off statistics showing that Netflix original productions employed 140,000 people between 2020 and 2024, contributing $125 billion to the U.S. economy. “We are producing in all 50 states,” he said. “We’ve used 500 independent production companies to make content for us, about roughly 1,000 original projects.” Sarandos and Peters pointed out that Paramount’s offer might entail more job cuts, because Paramount and Warner have more overlap in their operations than Netflix and Warner. “In the offer that Paramount was talking about today, they also were talking about $6 billion of synergies,” said Sarandos. “Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. Yeah, so we’re not cutting jobs, we’re making jobs.”Sarandos also discussed HBO, the premium cable channel turned streamer—Netflix’s former rival and inspiration. Sarandos has famously said of Netflix that “the goal is to become HBO faster than HBO can become us,” comments he later modified to add he wants “CBS and BBC” too. Now that his company is set to become HBO’s parent, he said it can realize its true destiny as the leading light of prestige TV. “They’ve been doing gymnastics to make themselves into a general entertainment brand,” Sarandos said of HBO in the HBO Max era overseen by WBD CEO David Zaslav. “Under this transaction, they don’t have to do that anymore.” Both Netflix co-CEOs also hammered a message clearly aimed at regulators who might take anti-trust action to halt the deal: The combined company would hardly dominate TV. The Netflix deal spins off CNN, TNT, Discovery, HGTV, the Food Network and the company’s other cable channels, while the Paramount offer keeps the cable assets attached. Using Nielsen viewership data that appeared to include linear TV as well as streaming, Peters said Netflix commands just 8% of U.S. TV hours; adding HBO would raise that to 9%.“We’d still be behind YouTube,” he noted. “And we’d still be behind a combined Paramount–WBD at 14%.”BofA Research’s Media & Entertainment team used a different metric—total TV streaming—from Nielsen data to calculate that Warner and Netflix combined would be about 21% of the market, whereas Paramount and Warner would be 8%. Both would still come in behind YouTube at 28%, however. Trump weighed in on Sunday about his relationship with Sarandos and the pending antitrust question. Saying the Netflix co-CEO is a “fantastic person,” Trump added that the Warner-Netflix market share “could be a problem.” At any rate, Trump added, uncharacteristically for a sitting president, he would be involved in what happens next.Sarandos finished the UBS panel by reiterating to everyone listening and watching, many of whom have been long-term holders of Netflix stock, that he was “excited” about the deal. (The question of whether Netflix would sweeten its bid for WBD wasn’t raised.)“We think this deal with Warner Brothers is good for shareholders,” he said. “We think it’s good for consumers. We think it’s good for creators. We think it’s great for the entertainment industry as a whole.”[Editor’s note: one of the authors worked at Netflix from June 2024 through July 2025. The report was also updated to clarify that Paramount and Warner together would constitute 8% of TV time.]",

    "title": "Google Cloud CEO lays out 3-part strategy to meet AI’s energy demands after identifying it as the ‘most problematic thing’",
    "description": "Speaking at the Fortune Brainstorm AI conference, Google Cloud boss Thomas Kurian discussed how the company thinks about energy and data centers.",
    "fullText": "The immense electricity needs of AI computing was flagged early on as a bottleneck, prompting Alphabet’s Google Cloud to plan for how to source energy and how to use it, according to Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian.Recommended VideoSpeaking at the Fortune Brainstorm AI event in San Francisco on Monday, he pointed out that the company—a key enabler in the AI infrastructure landscape—has been working on AI since well before large language models came along and took the long view.“We also knew that the the most problematic thing that was going to happen was going to be energy, because energy and data centers were going to become a bottleneck alongside chips,” Kurian told Fortune’sAndrew Nusca. “So we designed our machines to be super efficient.”The International Energy Agency has estimated that some AI-focused data centers consume as much electricity as 100,000 homes, and some of the largest facilities under construction could even use 20 times that amount.At the same time, worldwide data center capacity will increase by 46% over the next two years, equivalent to a jump of almost 21,000 megawatts, according to real estate consultancy Knight Frank.  At the Brainstorm event, Kurian laid out Google Cloud’s three-pronged approach to ensuring that there will be enough energy to meet all that demand.First, the company seeks to be as diversified as possible in the kinds of energy that power AI computation. While many people say any form of energy can be used, that’s actually not true, he said. “If you’re running a cluster for training and you bring it up and you start running a training job, the spike that you have with that computation draws so much energy that you can’t handle that from some forms of energy production,” Kurian explained. The second part of Google Cloud’s strategy is being as efficient as possible, including how it reuses energy within data centers, he added.In fact, the company uses AI in its control systems to monitor thermodynamic exchanges necessary in harnessing the energy that has already been brought into data centers.And third, Google Cloud is working on “some new fundamental technologies to actually create energy in new forms,” Kurian said without elaborating further.Earlier on Monday, utility company NextEra Energy and Google Cloud said they are expanding their partnership and will develop new U.S. data center campuses that will include with new power plants as well.Tech leaders have warned that energy supply is critical to AI development alongside innovations in chips and improved language models.The ability to build data centers is another potential chokepoint as well. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently pointed out China’s advantage on that front compared to the U.S.“If you want to build a data center here in the United States, from breaking ground to standing up an AI supercomputer is probably about three years,” he said at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in late November. “They can build a hospital in a weekend.”",

    "description": "Glean, an enterprise AI unicorn, has hit $200 million in annual recurring revenue, CEO Arvind Jain said at Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.",
    "fullText": "Glean, last valued at $7.2 billion, has hit $200 million in annual recurring revenue, CEO Arvind Jain revealed at Fortune Brainstorm AI San Francisco. “What’s driving all of this is the awareness from CEOs and executives that this is the time to invest in AI,” Jain said in an exclusive interview before the conference. “Everybody has been looking for a safe, secure, more appropriate version of ChatGPT for their employees. And we bring the capabilities that ChatGPT brings to consumers to business users, and in the context of their company.”Jain founded Glean in 2019, and the company has made its name in enterprise search and AI applications. In June, Glean raised its $150 million Series F, sending its valuation over $7 billion, a leap from the $4.6 billion valuation the company fetched in 2024. “The biggest challenge that customers face with AI is the fact that AI technologies are actually not built for their companies,” said Jain. “Most of the AI technologies are built…on the data on the Internet, public data. And so when you bring those models…inside your company, and you try to actually make them do some work internally, they don’t really have any understanding of how your business works and your context.”And in an AI landscape with lots of ARR numbers floating around, Jain is clear: This ARR number includes only subscription revenues from their software—no consulting or services revenue. Jain adds that Glean’s contracts range from one to three years, and that there’s “no sub-one-year contract in our model.”Glean’s rise through the AI boom has been uniquely tied to the challenges that enterprises face when trying to apply AI. The much quoted MIT study from this summer—that 90% of generative AI pilots are failing—reflects the existential question for companies: Where does AI ROI actually come from?“There are two narratives,” said Jain. “One narrative of AI is that nothing works, and then the other one is that it’s taking off. It’s getting more serious. Companies are able to actually do many, many, many useful things with AI. And we’re definitely generating success and excitement for customers.”",

    "description": "Other countries are considering less drastic ways to control teenagers' social media use. On Nov. 30, Singapore said it would ban the use of smartphones on secondary school campuses.",
    "fullText": "Starting this Wednesday, many Australian teens will find it near impossible to access social media. That’s because, as of Dec. 10, social media platforms like TikTok and Instagram must bar those under the age of 16, or face significant fines. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the pending ban “one of the biggest social and cultural changes our nation has faced” in a statement.Recommended VideoMuch is riding on this ban—and not just in Australia. Other countries in the region are watching Canberra’s ban closely. Malaysia, for example, said that it also plans to bar under-16s from accessing social media platforms starting next year. Other countries are considering less drastic ways to control teenagers’ social media use. On Nov. 30, Singapore said it would ban the use of smartphones on secondary school campuses. Yet, governments in Australia and Malaysia argue a full social media ban is necessary to protect youth from online harms such as cyberbullying, sexual exploitation and financial scams.Tech companies have had varied responses to the social media ban. Some, like Meta, have been compliant, starting to remove Australian under-16s from Instagram, Threads and Facebook from Dec. 4, a week before the national ban kicks in. The social media giant reaffirmed their commitment to adhere to Australian law, but called for app stores to instead be held accountable for age verification.“The government should require app stores to verify age and obtain parental approval whenever teens under 16 download apps, eliminating the need for teens to verify their age multiple times across different apps,” a Meta spokesperson said.Others, like YouTube, sought to be excluded from the ban, with parent company Google even threatening to sue the Australian federal government in July 2025—to no avail.However, experts told Fortune that these bans may, in fact, be harmful, denying young people the place to develop their own identities and the space to learn healthy digital habits.“A healthy part of the development process and grappling with the human condition is the process of finding oneself. Consuming cultural material, connecting with others, and finding your community and identity is part of that human experience,” says Andrew Yee, an assistant professor at the Nanyang Technological University (NTU)’s Wee Kim Wee School of Communication and Information.Social media “allows young people to derive information, gain affirmation and build community,” says Sun Sun Lim, a professor in communications and technology at the Singapore Management University (SMU), who also calls bans “a very rough tool.”Yee, from NTU, also points out that young people can turn to platforms like YouTube to learn about hobbies that may not be available in their local communities. Forcing kids to go “cold turkey” off social media could also make for a difficult transition to the digital world once they are of age, argues Chew Han Ei, a senior research fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in the National University of Singapore (NUS).“The sensible way is to slowly scaffold [social media use], since it’s not that healthy social media usage can be cultivated immediately,” Chew says.EnforcementAustralia plans to enforce its social media ban by imposing a fine of 49.5 million Australian dollars (US$32.9 million) on social media companies which fail to take steps to ban those under 16 from having accounts on their platforms.Malaysia has yet to explain how it might enforce its own social media ban, but communications minister Fahmi Fadzil suggested that social media platforms could verify users through government-issued documents like passports. Though young people may soon figure out how to maintain their access to social media. “Youths are savvy, and I am sure they will find ways to circumvent these,” says Yee of NTU. He also adds that young may migrate to platforms that aren’t traditionally defined as social media, such as gaming sites like Roblox. Other social media platforms, like YouTube, also don’t require accounts, thus limiting the efficacy of these bans, he adds.Forcing social media platforms to collect huge amounts of personal data and government-issued identity documents could also lead to data privacy issues. “It’s very intimate personally identifiable information that’s being collected to verify age—from passports to digital IDs,” Chew, from NUS, says. “Somewhere along the line, a breach will happen.”Moving towards healthy social media useIronically, some experts argue that a ban may absolve social media platforms of responsibility towards their younger users. “Social media bans impose an unfair burden on parents to closely supervise their children’s media use,” says Lim of SMU. “As for the tech platform, they can reduce child safety safeguards that make their platforms safer, since now the assumption is that young people are banned from them, and should not have been venturing [onto them] and opening themselves up to risks.”And rather than allow digital harms to proliferate, social media platforms should be held responsible for ensuring they “contribute to intentional and purposeful use”, argues Yee.This could mean regulating companies’ use of user interface features like auto-play and infinite scroll, or ensuring algorithmic recommendations are not pushing harmful content to users.“Platforms profit—lucratively, if I may add—from people’s use, so they have a responsibility to ensure that the product is safe and beneficial for its users,” Yee explains. Finally, conversations on safe social media use should center the voices of young people, Yee adds.“I think we need to come to a consensus as to what a safe and rights-respecting online space is,” he says. “This must include young people’s voices, as policy design should be done in consultation with the people the policy is affecting.”",

The book jumps back and forth in time between Poppy and Alex's past vacations and their current reunion in Palm Springs.The movie stars Emily Bader and Tom Blyth as Poppy and Alex, respectively, with a supporting cast of Sarah Catherine Hook, Jameela Jamil, Lucien Laviscount, Lukas Gage, Alan Ruck, and Molly Shannon.\n\n 'Box Hill'\n\n \"Box Hill.\"\n\n New Directions \n\n \"Box Hill,\" a 2020 novel written by Adam Mars-Jones, is being turned into the film \"Pillion,\" which will be released in theaters on February 6.The book (and film) follows Colin, a gay man, who becomes involved in a relationship with Ray, his polar opposite. While Colin is shy, introverted, and even a bit timid, Ray is confident and controlling.The film stars Harry Melling as Colin and Alexander Skarsgård as Ray.\n\n 'Wuthering Heights'\n\n \"Wuthering Heights.\"\n\n Penguin Random House \n\n If you somehow escaped high school without reading Emily Brontë's 1847 gothic classic \"Wuthering Heights,\" now is the perfect time to tick it off your reading list, ahead of its newest film adaptation releasing on February 13.The film stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as doomed lovers Catherine and Heathcliff, who are torn apart by societal expectations, time, illness, resentment, and guilt.But since this is an Emerald Fennell movie (director of \"Saltburn\" and \"Promising Young Woman\"), you shouldn't expect a run-of-the-mill book-to-film adaptation.\n\n 'Broken'\n\n \"Broken.\"\n\n William Morrow \n\n \"Broken\" is a 2020 collection of six novellas written by famed author Don Winslow. One of its short stories, \"Crime 101,\" has been adapted into a film that hits theaters on February 13.The story takes its title from California's iconic Highway 101, which runs from Los Angeles all the way up to the California-Portland border.In it, a master jewel thief named Mike Davis perfectly executes heists up and down the 101 with an elite crew, but Detective Lou Lubesnick is on his tail.Chris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo play Mike and Lou respectively, while the rest of the cast is filled out by Barry Keoghan, Halle Berry, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nick Nolte, and more.\n\n 'Cold Storage'\n\n \"Cold Storage.\"\n\n Harper \n\n \"Cold Storage\" is the third book adaptation that will be released on February 13. It's based on David Koepp's 2019 novel of the same name and follows a trio of unlikely friends who team up to stop a mutant killing machine from ending the world.It stars Joe Keery, Georgina Campbell, and Liam Neeson.\n\n 'Reminders of Him'\n\n \"Reminders of Him.\"\n\n Montlake \n\n The first of two Colleen Hoover books to hit the big screen in 2026 is \"Reminders of Him,\" which was published in 2022. The film will be released on March 13.Like all Hoover's books, this story deals with heavy themes, including alcoholism, death, life after incarceration, grief, and redemption — and, of course, romance.The story follows Kenna, a young woman who is released from prison after seven years and is desperately trying to get her life back and reconnect with her daughter, Diem. The story flashes back and forth in time to show how Kenna ended up in prison after the death of her boyfriend, Scotty, and how she's finding new love with Scotty's best friend, Ledger.Maika Monroe, Tyriq Withers, and Rudy Pankow play Kenna, Ledger, and Scotty, respectively, while Scotty's parents are played by Lauren Graham and Bradley Whitford.\n\n 'Project Hail Mary'\n\n \"Project Hail Mary.\"\n\n Ballantine Books \n\n Andy Weir, author of the beloved novel \"The Martian,\" published \"Project Hail Mary\" in 2021 to critical acclaim. Five years later, the story of astronaut Ryland Grace, played by another RG (Ryan Gosling), is coming to cinemas on March 20.The story begins with Ryland waking up aboard a spaceship with no memory of who he is or how he got there. From there, we flash back to learn that Ryland is a science teacher who was recruited for this mission to save the human race, as our sun is dying.People love this book — and love its directors Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, the brains behind \"Into the Spider-Verse\" and \"21 Jump Street\" — so the hype is high for this one.\n\n 'The Dog Stars'\n\n \"The Dog Stars.\"\n\n Vintage \n\n \"The Dog Stars,\" written by Peter Heller, was published in 2012. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic society with the survivors of a flu-like pandemic. It follows a pilot living an isolated existence in Colorado with just one other (quite bitter) person for company. But when he hears a mysterious signal over his plane's radio while flying one day, he resolves to seek out its source.The film adaptation, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Jacob Elordi and Josh Brolin, will be released on March 27.\n\n 'Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Story'\n\n \"Three Bags Full: A Sheep Detective Story.\"\n\n Soho Crime \n\n Yes, it's exactly what it sounds like: \"Three Bags Full,\" a German novel written in 2006 by Leonie Swann, focuses on a flock of sheep who become determined to solve the murder of their beloved shepherd, George.The adaptation, which has been retitled \"The Sheep Detectives,\" stars Hugh Jackman as George, while his flock of sheep are voiced by Bryan Cranston, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Chris O'Dowd, Regina Hall, and Patrick Stewart.It will be released on May 8.\n\n 'The Odyssey'\n\n \"The Odyssey.\"\n\n W. W. Norton & Company \n\n Homer's epic poem has been translated from Homeric Greek a great many times since it was first translated in the 1500s.But director Christopher Nolan told Empire Magazine that he was specifically working off Emily Wilson's translation, published in 2017, so that's the one we'll recommend, too.If it's been a minute since you dusted off your Greek mythology gap, \"The Odyssey\" follows Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, on his decadeslong journey to return home after the Trojan War. Along the way, he meets some of the most iconic monsters, legends, and gods in the Greek canon, including the Cyclops, Circe, the Sirens, Athena, and more.The film hits theaters on July 17, though tickets at some theaters are already sold out.\n\n 'The Book of Magic'\n\n \"The Book of Magic.\"\n\n Scribner \n\n Maybe you could've guessed from the cover, but \"The Book of Magic,\" written by Alice Hoffman, is the long-awaited sequel to her novel \"Practical Magic.\" The first book was published in 1995, and 26 years later, Hoffman published its follow-up in 2021.The film adaptations will have a similarly long gap. \"Practical Magic\" was released in theaters in 1998, and its sequel, \"Practical Magic 2,\" will be released on September 18.Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are back as the witchy Owens sisters, as are Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest as their magical aunts. Newcomers to the cast include Joey King, Xolo Maridueña, Maisie Williams, and Lee Pace.\n\n 'Sense and Sensibility'\n\n \"Sense and Sensibility.\"\n\n Penguin Classics \n\n Thirty years after \"Sense and Sensibility\" was adapted by Emma Thompson and Ang Lee, the 1811 novel by Jane Austen will once again return to the silver screen, this time starring Daisy Edgar-Jones, Esmé Creed-Miles, Caitríona Balfe, Frank Dillane, Herbert Nordrum, and George MacKay, on September 25.\"Sense and Sensibility\" is the tale of the Dashwood sisters, who are left penniless after their half-brother and his wife take almost all of their inheritance from their father. While Elinor (Edgar-Jones) tries to be practical, her younger sister Marianne (Creed-Miles) is determined to, as the kids say, romanticize her life.\n\n 'Verity'\n\n \"Verity.\"\n\n Grand Central Publishing \n\n \"Verity\" is the second Colleen Hoover adaptation of 2026, though it couldn't be more different from \"Reminders of Him.\"\"Verity,\" published in 2018, is easily Hoover's darkest book. It follows Lowen Ashleigh, a writer struggling to get by, who by chance gets hired to take over as the ghost writer for the now-comatose Verity Crawford. But when Lowen begins looking over Verity's manuscript, she soon wonders if she's reading a disturbing work of fiction, or a confession of heinous crimes.The adaptation stars Dakota Johnson as Lowen, Anne Hathaway as Verity, and Josh Hartnett as Verity's husband Jeremy. It will come to theaters on October 2.\n\n 'Incidents Around the House'\n\n \"Incidents Around the House.\"\n\n Del Rey \n\n This one isn't for the faint of heart. \"Incidents Around the House,\" written by Josh Malerman in 2024, is about an 8-year-old girl, Bela, who is terrorized by a mysterious entity she calls Other Mommy.Fittingly, the adaptation, which comes to big screens on October 9, has a new title: \"Other Mommy.\" It stars Jessica Chastain, Jay Duplass, Dichen Lachman, and Arabella Olivia Clark as Bela.\n\n 'Remain'\n\n \"Remain.\"\n\n Random House \n\n No, it's not a particularly random game of MadLibs — director M. Night Shyamalan and romance author Nicholas Sparks teamed up to write the novel \"Remain,\" which was published earlier this year.\"Remain\" is the story of architect Tate Donovan, who retreats to a bed-and-breakfast in Cape Cod after the death of his mother. Before long, he bonds with a mysterious resident of the small town named Wren. But, as this is a Shyamalan story, all is not what it seems.The film, which stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor as Tate and Wren, will be released in theaters on October 23.\n\n 'Sunrise on the Reaping'\n\n \"Sunrise on the Reaping.\"\n\n Scholastic Press \n\n For years, fans begged \"Hunger Games\" author Suzanne Collins to tell the story of Haymitch Abernathy's games. In March 2025, she obliged, publishing \"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" a \"Hunger Games\" prequel that takes place 24 years before the first novel.It tells the story of the 25th Hunger Games, which Haymitch, the future tribute mentor for District 12, won. As with all \"Hunger Games\" books, it's devastating.\"The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,\" which boasts an all-star cast of Mckenna Grace, Jesse Plemons, Ralph Fiennes, Glenn Close, Kieran Culkin, Elle Fanning, Billy Porter, Maya Hawke, Lili Taylor, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Whitney Peak, and newcomer Joseph Zada as Haymitch, will be in theaters on November 20.\n\n 'Dune Messiah'\n\n \"Dune: Messiah.\"\n\n Berkley Medallion \n\n After the two-part adaptation of \"Dune,\" the third film in the series is set to take on Frank Herbert's second novel in the series, \"Dune Messiah,\" published in 1969.Picking up after the events of \"Dune: Part Two,\" \"Dune: Part Three\" will follow Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he struggles to control the galaxy, prevent the death of millions, avenge his father, and juggle relationships with Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and his love Chani (Zendaya). It's set to be released on December 18.\n\n 'The Love Hypothesis'\n\n \"The Love Hypothesis.\"\n\n Berkley \n\n We've reached the part of the list where the adaptations don't have official release dates, but it's a safe bet that they'll come out at some point in 2026.First up is Ali Hazelwood's \"The Love Hypothesis,\" originally published in 2021, after originally being posted on the internet as \"Star Wars\" fan fiction.It's about a young PhD student, Olive, who, after a series of mishaps, is forced to fake-date a faculty member at her university: Dr. Adam Carlsen. You can guess what happens.The film will star Lili Reinhart as Olive and Tom Bateman as Adam — and fans are already frothing at the mouth after Reinhart's TikToks from set went viral.\n\n 'The Last Mrs. Parrish'\n\n \"The Last Mrs. Parrish.\"\n\n Harper Paperbacks \n\n This 2017 novel written by Liv Constantine tells the tale of Amber Patterson, a scammer with a plan to take over the life of rich, beautiful socialite Daphne Parrish.The film, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Isabel May as Amber, Jennifer Lopez as Daphne, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Daphne's husband, Jackson, is expected to hit Netflix at some point next year.And if that's not enough, there's always the sequel, \"The Next Mrs. Parrish.\"\n\n 'You Deserve Each Other'\n\n \"You Deserve Each Other.\"\n\n G.P. Putnam's Sons \n\n Sarah Hogle wrote \"You Deserve Each Other\" in 2020. The novel is about Nicholas and Naomi, an engaged couple who are the furthest thing from soon-to-be-newlywed bliss. In fact, they're in a game of chicken to see who can call off the wedding (and be stuck with the nonrefundable deposits) first.The film adaptation will star Meghann Fahy and Penn Badgley as Naomi and Nick, with a supporting cast of Natalie Morales, Justin Long, Kyle MacLachlan, and Ana Gasteyer. It's not yet known if it will head straight to Prime Video or get a theatrical run.\n\n 'Cry to Heaven'\n\n \"Cry to Heaven.\"\n\n Ballantine Books \n\n Nine years after his last directorial effort, Deadline reported that Tom Ford is going to adapt Anne Rice's 1982 novel \"Cry to Heaven,\" with an aimed release date of fall 2026.The novel follows a student and teacher in 18th-century Italy: Tonio Treschi and Guido Maffeo.While we don't know who is playing whom yet, the announced cast is already iconic: Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ciarán Hinds, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, George MacKay, Paul Bettany, Hunter Schafer, Thandiwe Newton, and, making her acting debut, Adele.\n\n 'One Italian Summer'\n\n \"One Italian Summer.\"\n\n Atria Books \n\n Paramount acquired the rights to adapt Rebecca Serle's 2022 novel \"One Italian Summer\" in 2023, per Variety, but for over two years there was no news.That is until a throwaway line in a December 2025 Hollywood Reporter piece about David Ellison's takeover of Paramount mentioned that the project would be moving forward starring Brie Larson.The novel is about Katy, a 30-something woman mourning the death of her mother and best friend, Carol. As the two had planned a luxurious Italian vacation before Carol's death, Katy decides to take the trip herself to try to reconnect with her mother's spirit, but she gets a bit more than she asked for when she seemingly meets a younger version of her mom on the beach.\n\n 'The Bodyguard'\n\n \"The Bodyguard.\"\n\n Griffin \n\n Netflix announced that Katherine Center's novel \"The Bodyguard,\" published in 2022, will be adapted for the streamer — and while no release date has been set, since the film takes place around the holidays, we can assume a November or December release date is in the cards.The story follows Jack Stapleton, a famous actor with a stalker, who hires bodyguard Hannah Brooks, to protect him. But since he doesn't want to worry his sick mother, the two instead pretend to date.The catch with this adaptation? Since there's already a quite famous film called \"The Bodyguard,\" Netflix, along with stars Leighton Meester and Jared Padalecki, are asking fans to come up with a new name for the film.",

    "description": "Mark Zandi thinks an AI-fueled market crash would be a risk to the broader financial system. Tech firms have led a year of record bond issuance in 2025.",
    "fullText": "Debt is a growing concern in the bear case for AI, and it's enough of a worry that a top economist says it should be considered a risk to the broader financial system if things go awry in the tech sector. Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, has been bearish on the US economy all year. He's been focused on the growing threat of a recession, but recently, the economist flagged another concerning trend in the tech world. Zandi noted that AI hyperscalers are taking on high levels of debt through record bond issuance in 2025, eclipsing the borrowing by tech companies in the years before the dot-com bubble popped. My previous post on the surge in bond issuance by the big artificial intelligence companies has generated a bunch of questions. A common thread in the Qs concerns how the borrowing done by AI companies compares to that done by internet companies during the Y2K stock market… pic.twitter.com/vBjJQ3g0Mu— Mark Zandi (@Markzandi) December 7, 2025 \n \"Issuance so far this year by all technology companies, including AI and telecommunications companies that did the bulk of the borrowing around Y2K to expand the internet, dwarfs that done around Y2K,\" he wrote on X.He emphasized that companies aren't simply refinancing existing debt, but increasing their borrowing as they fight for a share of the booming AI market. Zandi argued that, even adjusting for inflation, tech-sector borrowing is at records. What's more, surging debt is a major risk to broader markets and the economy, he said.\"Borrowing by AI companies should be on the radar screen as a mounting potential threat to the financial system and broader economy.\" Zandi's posts reiterated a bearish argument about the AI market and the economic outlook he made earlier this month, warning of misguided optimism driving the investment frenzy. \"There are soaring AI stock prices, which discount this optimism, and arguably, a lot more,\" he said in an earlier post. \"There are the massive (over) investments being made in data centers and other AI infrastructure.\"His concerns echo those of other commentators who have attempted to sound the alarm on colossal spending on AI infrastructure and data centers. Skeptics fear that, even for industry-leading companies, the payoff from AI is uncertain, and the economics of the technology could easily be upended as they were for early internet companies in the 2000s. Zandi argues that if companies can't keep pace with expectations, it could send share prices down, negatively impact other tech stocks, and shake confidence in the entire industry.Zandi's thesis on the AI boom and dot-com bust also includes the warning that the 2000s crash was mostly felt by equity investors. However, with debt levels rising, an AI-fueled market event would be felt across markets more broadly, increasing systemic risks.",

    "description": "Buying a charming, historic old house that was built a century ago has been an expensive nightmare, not a dream. We've made mistakes as homeowners.",
    "fullText": "When my partner and I bought our first house together eight years ago, we knew we wanted a place with character.We'd both lived in new builds before and dreamed of owning a place with more charm and a real history. Then, we found exactly what we were looking for in a four-story house built in the early 1900s.We fell in love with its high ceilings, spacious rooms, old stone garden wall, and semi-rural location, and we purchased it.Eight years later, our relationship with the house is a lot more complicated.After a few dreamy months, the reality of living in a century-old house set in\n\n Our house comes with a lot of quirks.\n\n Samantha Priestly\n\n At first, living in our historic Edwardian house was everything we'd hoped it would be. Our neighbors shared stories of the people who'd lived here before us and of what the area used to be like when it was mostly farmland. We felt a strong connection to the house and all its previous inhabitants.We loved the exposed beams in the attic rooms and the sandstone on the exterior walls — even the narrow, steep staircases had their charm.The two of us loved village life, and still do, actually. It was satisfying to realize our dreams of living in a period property.Before moving in, we had several projects on our list that needed to be completed. For example, replacing the old windows and doors and converting an old stable at the bottom of the garden into an office.However, those projects got pushed to the back burner as things we hadn't anticipated started to go wrong, and new problems began to drain our bank account.Big issues are tough, but the little grievances really add up\n\n A bad leak destroyed a large portion of our home.\n\n Samantha Priestly\n\n Being a homeowner isn't cheap, especially not in an old home. A few years after moving in, a fire broke out in the fuse box in our basement kitchen.Thankfully, it was small and contained — but when the electrician began repairs, he discovered that the wiring had been cobbled together and was still hazardous. We ended up rewiring the entire kitchen.One day, while I was showering, my partner ran in and said water was pouring into the living room below. The leaks were horrible, and we had to redo our bathroom.However, what really makes this house more of a nightmare than a dream is all the little issues that rumble on and on.It's drafty and hard to heat in the winter, perhaps because of those lovely high ceilings and certainly because of cracks and gaps in the walls.It's damp, and mold grows on many of the walls in the cold seasons. We're constantly battling with it, wiping mold off surfaces and painting walls to keep them looking fresh.Corners are crumbling, and our clothes in drawers and wardrobes smell stale with the damp if we haven't worn them for a few weeks.There's no parking space outside as these old houses weren't built with cars in mind. This means we have to park on the road, and the once-quiet road is now getting busier and busier.And I've never lived in a house with so many creepy crawlies invading our space. Spiders, flies, and beetles wander freely around our rooms. I guess they're getting in the same way the drafts do, through all those small cracks and holes.We didn't truly freak out until one night when my partner went down to the basement kitchen for a drink of water and stepped on a slug with his bare feet. Since then, we've noticed slug trails on our living room carpets and have found slugs on our bathroom tiles.The honeymoon period is officially over\n\n Would we do it again? I can't say for sure we would.\n\n Samantha Priestly\n\n For us, the reality of living in an old house is far removed from our dreams. We romanticized having a period property, but we didn't properly consider the issues that a house over 100 years old would have. Houses were built differently then, and we aren't benefiting from modern designs or upgraded ways of doing things; we're stuck in the past.I must admit that I still love the character of old houses, but we now look longingly at modern homes with efficient heating, driveways, and no mold.Looking back, I wish we'd tried to strike a balance. We love the individuality of our home that is far from cookie-cutter, but it'd be nice to have a property with good wiring, proper insulation, and fewer maintenance requirements.",

    "description": "David Ellison is officially chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance after an $8 billion tie-up. Next on his wish list: Warner Bros Discovery.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is officially the CEO of Paramount Skydance. After a successful Paramount merger, next on his wish list is Warner Bros. Discovery — and he's launched a hostile takeover bid in an effort to scoop it out from Netflix's hands.The 42-year-old founded Skydance back in 2006 with some help from his father Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder who's worth $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Since then, Skydance has enjoyed considerable success with films including \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" and \"Baywatch,\" and a total box office haul of more than $8 billion. The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.Its biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\n David Ellison and his wife, Sandra Lynn Modic, at the London premiere of \"Top Gun: Maverick.\"\n\n Lia Toby/Getty Images\n\n After seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.He gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.Before becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.In 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.The movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.Merging with Paramount and becoming CEOSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.The film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.Ellison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.The $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.Soon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.Ellison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.Ellison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"Ellison hopes to steal Netflix's thunder with hostile WBD bidNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.Paramount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.Warner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.Ellison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.That morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "description": "YouTuber MKBHD recently tested the Xiaomi SU7 Max. He praised its various features and low price tag. Ford CEO Jim Farley is a fan of it too.",
    "fullText": "The Chinese electric vehicles continue to make waves in the US — even if you can't buy them. One of the most influential tech critics just gave his stamp of approval.YouTuber Marques Brownlee, who goes by MKBHD, drove a Xiaomi SU7 Max for two weeks. The EV retails for 299,000 Chinese yuan, or about $42,000. Compare that to a Tesla Model 3 Performance, which retails at just under $55,000.The verdict? MKBHD was blown away.\"This feels nothing like a $42,000 car,\" he said. \"This is a nice car.\"Walking around the EV, MKBHD compared it to a variety of other vehicles, including a Polestar and Mercedes. It looked a bit like a Porsche Taycan, he said, and had a Porsche-like steering wheel.Inside, MKBHD called the software \"so good.\" It looked like what Apple would have done if the company made a car, he said.\n\n Xiaomi offers the SU7 in standard, Pro, Max, and Ultra.\n\n Costfoto/NurPhoto via Getty Images\n\n MKBHD was particularly impressed with the vehicle's accessory mounting points. Drivers can add additional gadgets like a speedometer, magnetic phone mount, charger, microphone, or walkie-talkie.\"What other car does this?\" he asked. \"I've never seen the ability to customize just how much hardware, or how little hardware, you have in the interior layout like Xiaomi does.\"Taking it for a drive, MKBHD said that it was a \"really capable car,\" comparing it to a Tesla Model 3 or a BMW I4.\"This is a $42,000 car that feels like a $75,000 car,\" he added.Like other Chinese EVs, the Xiaomi Speed Ultra 7 is not available in the United States, although more Americans have been going to great lengths to drive them. Ford CEO Jim Farley said in October that he loved the EV.\"We flew one from Shanghai to Chicago, and I've been driving it for six months now, and I don't want to give it up,\" Farley said on \"The Fully Charged Podcast.\"\n\n The Xiaomi SU7 interior has several accessory mounting points.\n\n CFOTO/Future/Getty Images\n\n Xiaomi is in many more industries than EVs. The company sells phones, robot vacuums, and more. Its EV division recently posted its first profit, a rarity for the industry.Speaking to the question of what would happen if Chinese EVs were ever offered in the US, MKBHD asked: \"Are we cooked?\"Not yet, he said — because they're not available. That international crossover is muddled by political conflict, he said.\"We may never get a car like this available in the US for $42,000,\" he said, citing tariffs and import fees.However, other markets will soon face the competition. Xiaomi's EVs are headed to Europe in 2027, the company's president said on an August earnings call.Europe could prove a helpful battleground for Xiaomi. While the Chinese EV company sets up shop, American producers like Tesla faced challenges in the market. European Tesla sales were down an estimated 48.5% year over year in October, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.\"It raises the ceiling for all cars to get better, more impressive, and more complete,\" MKBHD said.",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to put billions into Paramount/WBD. Why?",
    "description": "Paramount's Larry and David Ellison are making a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Three of their partners are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.",
    "fullText": "The governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to invest billions of dollars into a would-be mega media conglomerate made up of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery.What would they get for their money?Spoiler: I don't know. And Paramount, the company that wants to use the three oil nations to help finance its bid for WBD, won't say.But it sure seems like a question worth asking, as Paramount launches a hostile bid for WBD after losing last week's auction to Netflix.Paramount says the three petrostates will be part of the new bid — as they were in Paramount's previous offers for WBD (something Paramount had at one point denied).As of a week ago, those three countries were going to kick in $24 billion — double the $11.8 billion the Ellison family planned to invest in WBD.Now, Paramount won't say how much the three countries' sovereign wealth funds plan to invest in their newest proposal. It says Larry and David Ellison, who currently own Paramount, along with RedBird Capital, the private equity group, will \"backstop\" the deal — meaning they promise to finance all of it if necessary.But Paramount still anticipates those three countries will ultimately invest in a combined Paramount/WBD, along with Jared Kushner — Donald Trump's son-in-law, whose Affinity Partners group invests money on behalf of … Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, among others.The difference this time around, Paramount says, is that those countries' sovereign wealth funds won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would operate. They wouldn't get board seats, voting rights, or any other governance over the company. Paramount declined to comment.The reason Paramount needs to stress that, apparently, is that Warner Bros. Discovery had previously flagged that as an issue. Now that the oil states won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would be run, Paramount says the deal wouldn't need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a regulatory body that's supposed to sign off on foreign investments in some US companies.That's all part of Paramount's pitch it is making to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders: A deal for Paramount to buy WBD will pass regulators much more easily than Netflix buying WBD.But who knows how that will actually pan out? Up until last week, the conventional wisdom was that Paramount would be the most likely winner for WBD, in no small part because Larry Ellison was a longtime Donald Trump backer, and his son, David, had been trying to curry favor with Trump as well.Now it turns out that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was also wooing Trump. He visited Trump at the White House, and Trump seems to have been taken with him: \"He was in the Oval Office last week. I have a lot of respect for him. He is a great person,\" Trump told reporters Sunday night. \"Ted has really done a legendary job.\"So in a world where Donald Trump is the most important decision-maker when it comes to what American companies are allowed to do, I don't know if the niceties of CFIUS rules will be the ultimate arbiter. (Here I'll note that last year the US passed a law that required China's ByteDance to divest itself of its ownership in the US. TikTok business or shut down. That hasn't happened, and TikTok is still alive and well in the U.S.)I also don't know if Trump will particularly care that three Middle Eastern oil states could conceivably own a big chunk of a conglomerate that includes CNN, CBS, HBO, and two movie studios. He has been quite eager to do deals in the Middle East, and last month he rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi crown prince at the White House.And perhaps that eagerness explains why Paramount didn't think it was a big deal to include petrostate investments in the past — and why it still thinks it's OK to have them now.But again: If Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi are looking to put anything close to $24 billion into an enormously powerful media conglomerate — one with huge reach in both the US and ambitions for the rest of the world — will they be satisfied with purely financial returns? Or do they expect something else for their money?I'd love to know. Maybe you would, too.",

    "description": "We reviewed the Cuyana Easy Tote, System Tote, Mila Satchel, Forma Satchel, and Double Loop Satchel. Here's why they we keep coming back to the brand.",
    "fullText": "We've tested lots of bags over the years. In fact, I would estimate that our team has probably tested close to a hundred totes, if not more. So when we say that we love Cuyana, we mean it.The brand is known for functional bags made of high-quality leather. Many of its totes and satchels are also compatible with snap-in bag organizers, which you can purchase separately. The leather is soft, wears nicely, and holds its shape.The only issue with Cuyana is that the bags are relatively expensive — mostly retailing for $300 and up. But if it's in your budget, we recommend splurging a little since the totes and satchels will last you a long time. Ours have held up over the years and still look great.For more of our rigorously tested bag coverage, see our articles on the best work bags for women, the best tote bags, the best convertible backpack totes, and more.\n\n Classic Easy Tote\n\n Sally Kaplan/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Cuyana\n\n Who it's perfect for: People who want a soft leather tote bag that's versatile enough for work, travel, and general schlepping.Who should skip it: Those who prefer their totes to have structure.Cuyana's Classic Easy Tote is our top pick for the best tote bag because it's chic, durable, flexible but not floppy, and can fit a huge amount of stuff. And though it looks like a basic tote at first glance, there are actually a ton of thoughtful details that have gone into the design of the bag. Two sets of straps mean you can carry the tote like a handbag, or you can use the longer set of straps to throw it over your shoulder. Internally, there is a small pocket for things you need to grab frequently, and there's a tie you can use to close the bag up a little more if you want.Cuyana also makes several accessories, like the Classic Tote Insert, for organizing the interior of your bag. These are great if you like a bit more structure or interior protection since the soft Italian leather is unlined inside. I've had my bag for about four years now and I've taken it on every vacation, flight, weekend trip, and long car ride in that time. It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it.On a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks. I use the interior tie to keep it closed when I have to shove it under my seat on a plane, but they also make a zippered version of the Easy Tote if you prefer the added security. Just note that you may not be able to shove quite as much stuff in it if you wanted to zip it closed. —Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews.Other versions of the Easy ToteThe Classic Easy Zipper Tote has been updated with a top zipper for security and internal snaps that are compatible with Cuyana's bag organizers, such as pouches and laptop sleeves (the original does not have the snaps). We think this is one of the best travel totes, since the zipper keeps all of your belongings secure, even when you have to put your bag under the seat in front of you.Small Easy Tote, which is a little less bulky but still fits a 14-inch laptop.Tall Easy Tote, which is longer vertically than horizontally.\n\n System Tote\n\n Insider \n\n Check price at Cuyana\n\n Who it's perfect for: People who want custom organizational features, like the option to pick between an internal zippered pouch or a flap pouch and the ability to snap in or remove a laptop sleeve.Who should skip it: Those who want a lightweight tote, since the organizational features make it heavier.The Cuyana 13-inch System Tote is easily one of the most versatile totes out there. The bag itself is relatively simple in design, with seamless top handles that fit tightly around your shoulder and a small internal pocket. But it also comes with internal D-rings that allow you to attach a cross-body strap, and you can snap in one of Cuyana's tote organizers for extra customizability.The leather is extremely supple, and it softens over time with use, so don't expect this to be a super structured bag. If you're deciding between the 13-inch and 16-inch options, I would go with the larger style. I've tested the smaller one and my only complaint has been that I wish it were roomier. The brand introduced the larger one later on to solve that problem! — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews.You can also get other versions of the System Tote, like:The 16-inch System Tote, which is the same but large enough to fit a bigger laptop.The System Zippered Tote, which has all the same features but comes with a top zipper for added security.\n\n Double Loop Satchel\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Cuyana\n\n Who it's perfect for: Stylish corporate folks who want a work tote that looks like a chic (and very trendy for fall) hobo bag.Who should skip it: People who want their tote to double as a carry-on, since the top doesn't zip.Equal parts stylish and functional, Cuyana's Double Loop Satchel is a splurge, but I believe it's worth every penny.It has an elegant, unique silhouette that resembles an oversized shoulder bag more so than a traditional tote bag. If you're going right from work to happy hour, this is a perfect way to look professional but not stuffy.Plus, the interior and exterior pockets are relatively minimalist. There are two exterior magnetic pockets on either side that are perfect for stashing small go-tos like a packet of tissues or my iPhone. The inside of the bag is pretty simple in design: there's an open laptop pocket that can hold a computer up to 14 inches (a 16-inch laptop can fit in the main compartment) plus one zippered pocket.You can also add more compartments. If you prefer some more organizational features (like I do), you can snap on a System Flap Bag (sold separately) to add another magnetic interior pocket. Though it's an extra cost, I feel it's worth it since the System Flap Bag can be detached and used as a clutch — or you can purchase a strap for it to turn it into a small crossbody tote. — Talia Ergas, freelance style writer.\n\n Forma Satchel\n\n Samantha Crozier/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Cuyana\n\n Who it's perfect for: People who need a larger bag for all of their work essentials, since the bag can fit a 16-inch laptop with tons of room to spare.Who should skip it: People who want a lightweight tote that they can sling over their shoulder.This sophisticated satchel from Cuyana is crafted from materials that would impress any leather nerd. The full-grain, Italian pebbled leather is luxe and touchable. We've been testing Cuyana for years, so we know firsthand that the brand's leather ages beautifully. And besides, the material just looks expensive.I also love the option to transform this oversized tote into a chic purse-like shape. The collapsible sides make it a versatile work travel tote since they can be folded out for plane rides and in for client meetings.As always, Cuyana has delivered a bag with tons of sophistication on the outside and heaps of practicality on the inside. The bag can snap in the same pouches and zippered pockets as the System Tote, but it also has a built-in divider and three internal pockets.One issue I have with this tote is how heavy it is. The Forma Satchel weighs 3.6 pounds, which is definitely on the heftier side. I've tested dozens of totes for my article on the best work bags for women, and I've preferred bags that are 2.5 pounds or under. Much of this extra weight is due to the bag's thick, quality leather — but it still feels a little too heavy sometimes.The other issue I've encountered is the length of the handles. Beware that this is not a bag that you can easily sling over your shoulder. The handles are top handles, so you carry it on your forearm or in your hands, which is sometimes awkward and difficult with a bag this large. You can buy an adjustable shoulder or crossbody strap, but it will be an extra cost. — Samatha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews.\n\n Mila Satchel\n\n Samantha Crozier \n\n Check price at Cuyana\n\n Who it's perfect for: People who travel a lot for work and need a professional-looking bag that can double as a work tote and a functional carry-on. It would be especially great for those who frequently take day or overnight trips for their jobs since it's just big enough for your work essentials and an extra outfit.Who should skip it: People looking for a compact tote that just fits their laptop and some essentials. Also, people on a budget since this is one of the more expensive picks.This bag is bigger than a typical tote but smaller than a weekender. It has many work bag features, like a laptop slot that fits a computer up to 14 inches and a place to snap in Cuyana's signature organizational inserts. But it also has travel features, like a luggage sleeve that has a zipper at the bottom so that you can turn it into an outer pocket.Because of the sleek look, functional pockets, and travel-friendly details, this would make a great work travel companion. It can easily double as a functional carry-on and a professional work satchel.The Mila Satchel comes with a long strap so that you can sling the bag over your shoulder. The strap is adjustable and thick enough that it won't dig in. I use this strap a lot since it can be awkward to carry such a large bag with just the top handles. Sometimes, I wish the top handles were longer so that I could carry the bag on my shoulders without having to use the long strap. —Samatha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews.\n\n Travel Case Set\n\n Samantha Crozier/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Cuyana\n\n Who it's perfect for: People who travel a lot and want an elevated way to pack their makeup and accessories. Who should skip it: Anyone who wants more of a toiletry bag, since these aren't waterproof, won't protect against spills, and can't be taken into the shower. This travel case duo is a beautifully elevated way to tote your makeup and accessories. Both cases have a large opening, so you won't have to go digging for a lip liner — but despite the large opening, they both have a slim profile and a sleek look.When I went to Greece, I had planned to use the larger case as a makeup bag. But once I started filling it, I realized that even I (with my habit of bringing at least five lip colors to match all my outfits) couldn't fill it. I switched to the smaller case for makeup and was amazed that it could fit everything I needed. So I turned the larger case into a plane pouch for my carry-on and loved it. It fit a pill box, an eye mask, a tube of moisturizer, a contact case, compression socks, and everything else I needed for the flight. I loved carrying everything in a chic leather pouch, and I'm definitely going to keep using it as a catch-all for car rides and plane trips in the future. The only things I wouldn't use this for are liquids like shampoo and soap. The leather is beautiful, but not leakproof or water-resistant. Stick with less fancy nylon and plastic-based pouches for anything that leaks. —Samatha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews.",

    "description": "Hoffman, the billionaire LinkedIn cofounder, said he visited Epstein's island as part of his work fundraising for MIT.",
    "fullText": "LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said he wishes he'd known a little more before agreeing to spend a night on Jeffrey Epstein's island.On the Dec. 1 episode of Eric Newcomer's podcast, Hoffman said that he visited the island as part of his fundraising work for the MIT Foundation and was told the visit would make Epstein more likely to donate to MIT.\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. He said he stayed on the island for one night, and that there was a pool, a \"bunch of guest rooms,\" and a courtyard.\n\n Democrats on the House Oversight Committee recently released a collection of images and videos of Epstein's island, which was named Little Saint James and located in the US Virgin Islands.\n\n House Oversight Committee\n\n Hoffman has maintained that he only interacted with Epstein, whose 2019 death while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges was ruled a suicide, through his work fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. On the \"Newcomer\" podcast, he called Epstein a \"masterful networker,\" and recalled a 2015 dinner he hosted for an MIT researcher in Palo Alto, California.Hoffman said that Joi Ito, former director of the MIT Media Lab, asked him if Epstein could attend the dinner, which was also attended by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Similar to his visit to the island, Hoffman said he was later told that the financier had said he was more likely to donate if he attended the dinner.\"He's kind of going through the network, trying to meet people and so forth,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. Hoffman also reiterated previous apologies for his involvement with Epstein.In 2019, a spokesperson for Zuckerberg confirmed the dinner to Business Insider and said it was the only time the Facebook cofounder met Epstein. A spokesperson for Musk also confirmed the Tesla CEO's attendance.In a 2019 email to Axios, Hoffman acknowledged multiple interactions with Epstein, which he said were strictly for fundraising purposes, and said he had been told MIT had vetted and approved the convicted sex offender's participation. He said in the email he was \"deeply regretful\" of the involvement.\"I went and kind of made a, you know, very public apology because it was like, okay I realized this and I'd already at that point had ramped down connection with him, right, to like no meetings and all the rest of the stuff, under any context,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. \"And I think he still would drop me an email every so often and say, 'Hey, can we get on the phone?' I say, 'Oh, maybe sometime,' which is, you know, code for never, right?\"Hoffman said that justice for the late pedophile's victims is important, and urged the government to release, unredacted, \"every single piece of intel that they have about Epstein.\"In November, President Donald Trump signed a bill that will release the Department of Justice's files on Epstein after months of pressure from Congress, including some fellow Republicans. The department has until Saturday, December 19, to comply with the order.Trump has also ordered the DOJ to investigate Hoffman, along with other individuals he views as political enemies, including former President Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, over their ties to Epstein.Hoffman, a billionaire and major Democratic donor, has previously said that he had to hire security after Musk fueled conspiracy theories about his relationship with Epstein.",

    "title": "Morgan Stanley cuts Tesla's stock rating from 'buy' for the first time in 2 years on valuation concerns",
    "description": "Tesla stock fell on Monday as Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock from \"buy\" to \"hold.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock got a downgrade on Monday, sending it tumbling as much as 4% as Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation for the first time since 2023. Morgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco downgraded Tesla from an \"Overweight/Buy\" to an \"Equal Weight/Hold\" rating. While he increased his price target to $425 per share, up from the previous $410, his new target still implies about 3% downside from levels late in the day on Monday.The analyst noted that he believes Tesla will continue making progress on key initiatives, particularly its advancements in full self-driving and robotic technology. However, he thinks investors should wait for a better entry point, as share prices remain highly valued and the company could encounter further challenges amid lower demand for electric cars. Percoco said the bank had lowered its outlook specifically for Tesla's auto business. \"This is a reflection of lower volume expectations, with a 10.5% reduction in 2026 volumes and 18.5% reduction in cumulative deliveries through 2040 due to our more cautious view on the pace of EV adoption in the US coupled with growing competition in global markets.\"It's been a volatile year for Tesla. After being down as much as 45%, it's up about 12% year-to-date, staging a big turnaround since CEO Elon Musk returned to the carmaker full time after spending several months leading the Department of Government Efficiency. Percoco said that investors should be ready for trading to be volatile in the coming 12 months. \"While it is well understood that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, we expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,\" he said.Percoco's team recalibrated its sum-of-the-parts thesis that has informed the bank's Tesla valuation, accounting for Tesla's progress in developing humanoid robotics and robotaxi technology.It cited both robotaxi public launches and FSD advancements as likely investment drivers, but also flagged execution risk around the rollout of its robotaxi, FSD, and humanoid robots. One risk lies in Tesla's approach to FSD technology, an area that has sparked safety concerns from regulators and lawmakers. Most of its competitors rely on LiDAR technology to power their self-driving vehicles, a technology that Musk has criticized. Morgan Stanley analysts see this as a concern. \"TSLA has taken a unique camera-only approach with the rollout of its robotaxi service,\" the note said. \"While Tesla's camera-only approach drives a cost advantage (along with other factors discussed shortly) it will need to prove a very high level of safety in order to gain the trust of regulators, particularly in areas of the US with greater risk of inclement weather.\"And while enthusiasm for Tesla's Optimus robot is high, competition is rising, particularly from China. Percoco said China's government has prioritized developing the technology, posing a risk to a technology that Musk is staking much of Tesla's future growth prospects on.Percoco made it clear throughout the note that he's not bearish on Tesla stock, but he sees a strong possibility that the EV maker will struggle in the short term as it strives to position itself at the head of several emerging technologies.",

    "title": "Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos shares how he pitched Trump on the Warner Bros. deal",
    "description": "Netflix's co-CEO Ted Sarandos revealed that his winning pitch to Trump for the company to buy Warner Bros. centered on protecting and creating jobs.",
    "fullText": "Before Netflix made its winning bid for Warner Bros., its co-CEO pitched President Donald Trump directly on the merits of the deal.The pair found common ground, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.\"The president's interests in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said of Trump at the UBS media conference on Monday afternoon.Sarandos said he'd talked to Trump \"many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry.\"\"The president cares deeply about the entertainment industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,\" Sarandos continued.Trump praised Sarandos on Sunday, calling him a \"great person\" who he said had done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" Still, Trump said Netflix's \"big market share\" in the streaming space \"could be a problem\" as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.The Netflix-Warner Bros. deal reached on Friday is worth $82.7 billion, including $72 billion in equity. WBD's TV networks like CNN or HGTV, aren't in the proposal.Rival suitor Paramount Skydance responded on Monday with a hostile bid in the form of a $30-per-share, all-cash offer for all of WBD, including the declining TV networks. Netflix's offer is $27.75 per share, comprising mostly cash and some stock. There's debate among analysts about whether Netflix's or Paramount's renewed offer is more attractive, as it depends on the value of WBD's TV networks.Paramount's move \"was entirely expected,\" Sarandos said.Paramount CEO David Ellison, who Trump has publicly praised, went on CNBC on Monday morning to tout his company's offer as \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\" Ellison said his company's offer had \"faster regulatory certainty to close\" than Netflix's. Ellison's father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally and one of the richest people on the planet.However, Netflix also seems to be building rapport with Trump. That could help explain why Netflix's Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters are optimistic about their deal.\"We are very confident that regulators should, and will, approve it,\" Peters said of the WBD deal.Sarandos pitched the streaming giant's proposed acquisition as a net positive for the labor market, despite the concerns of many in Hollywood. He also said the company is \"deeply committed\" to releasing movies from Warner Bros. in theaters, \"exactly the way they've released those movies today.\"That overture could help ease Trump's concerns. Sarandos pitched Netflix as a great job saver.\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.Sarandos warned that Ellison would implement lots of layoffs if his bid won and said the Paramount CEO promised about $6 billion in cost savings from a WBD deal. Those so-called \"synergies,\" in analyst jargon, translate to a smaller workforce, Sarandos said.\"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,\" Sarandos said. \"We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"Netflix has promised investors $2 billion to $3 billion in its own cost savings from its Warner Bros. deal, however.",

Like the original Fyre Festival, it was heavily documented by camera crews and social media users.Since being released from prison in 2022, after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges related to Fyre Festival, McFarland has been planning redemption from the disastrous 2017 festival that left hundreds of attendees stranded, hungry, and thirsty on a Bahamian island and became the subject of a hit Netflix documentary.On Saturday and Sunday, McFarland ran it back with a smaller crowd, a mix of parties, excursions, and musical guests like French Montana as the headliner on Utila Bay, an island off the coast of Honduras. @pyrtbilly To everyone who laughed at the bathroom barge. To everyone who said there wouldn’t be power. Who wants to be part of history? See you in 4 days. ♬ original sound - Billy McFarland \n General admission tickets to PHNX cost $599. VIP passes went for up to $140,000 and included round-trip flights from Miami. PHNX offered all attendees brunch, lunch, dinner, and a handful of excursions, including scuba diving and a cave hike, in their ticket packages.The itinerary was a far cry from the events that unfolded in 2017. Where unsanitary or simply unavailable bathrooms became a hallmark of Fyre Festival's failures, McFarland showed off a \"bathroom barge\" of floating port-a-potties for PHNX. He also shared fresh fruit stands and food options, including lobster, steak, and fresh salads — a much different menu from the infamous cheese sandwiches served at the first Fyre Festival.Festival-goers, McFarland, and performers took their followers along for the ride at PHNX 2025. The event was also available via livestream for paying viewers.One performer, a DJ who goes by 220 Kid, documented his time at the festival in several videos. His post about the vegetarian food option went particularly viral. The plate of rice and a single cob of corn drew scrutiny and a call back to the meager cheese sandwiches from 2017. @220kidmusic Where my cheese sandwiches at ♬ original sound - 220 Kid Rappers Slim Jxmmi and Bobby Shmurda showed up, and a clip from headliner French Montana's set showed a modest crowd dancing. @maddsofficial Confirmed ! French showed up every artist did! Love this island so much ! #fyrefestival #PHNX ♬ original sound - Madds \"We set out to bring 400 people and a dozen artists to a private island in the Utila Bay Islands, and the experience exceeded every expectation,\" McFarland said in a statement. \"PHNX 2025 was a milestone moment for us.\"Videos showed dozens of festival-goers on the dance floor at different times. It's unclear how many people attended. PHNX appeared to sidestep the big issues that defined Fyre, but it's too early to tell whether the event represents a meaningful reset for McFarland.\"This is only the beginning — a major announcement is coming soon,\" McFarland said.",

This information was shared again on Chesney's Instagram shortly after, confirming the news. I've broken down how to get Kenny Chesney tickets for his 2026 return below.The official announcement and schedule were released on October 21, with five shows scheduled for June 2026. In addition to this, Kenny Chesney has an April appearance scheduled at the Tortuga Music Festival in Fort Lauderdale, which means there is no shortage of 2026 opportunities for the No Shoes Nation to catch the star performing live.Kenny Chesney, who boasts 30 million albums sold worldwide and multiple awards, released his debut album, \"In My Wildest Dreams,\" in 1994. Since then, with countless albums and singles to his name, Chesney has enjoyed a long and prosperous career. In 2025, Kenny Chesney was also named a member-elect to the Country Music Hall of Fame.The 2025 Las Vegas residency had been particularly exciting for fans, and, thanks to the venue's technological capabilities, they were not disappointed. Chesney himself said, \"These shows have been unbelievably fluid, capable of change-ups, and crazy requests. (…) When we said we were taking No Shoes Nation into another dimension, no one truly knew what that meant. Now that we do, we can't wait to come back and do it all over again.\" If you're looking to learn more about getting tickets to see Kenny Chesney in the summer of 2026 for his second innovative Sphere Las Vegas residency, we've got you covered.

Ticketmaster also provides links to partner site FEVO for package reservations, including suites alongside Sphere tickets.Additionally, tickets can be purchased from verified resale vendor sites, such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Depending on the demand for each individual date, you may find better-priced options on these sites over Ticketmaster.How much are Kenny Chesney tickets?Original tickets for Kenny Chesney’s Sphere residency vary in price depending on the location, with reserved seats ranging from $120 (Original Standard) to over $1,000 (Original Platinum). Some more affordable seat options may have limited screen visibility, which will be indicated on Ticketmaster if this is the case. Standing floor tickets are also available for around $265, which offers the closest distance to the stage and may be more affordable if you’re looking to get up close to the action and don’t mind standing. In general, the Sphere is an extremely interactive venue with a high volume of screens to view the show from, so being in a seat further back does not mean you will have trouble seeing or enjoying the performance.Resale prices are currently reasonable in comparison to standard tickets, as the shows still have original tickets available. StubHub prices range from $171 (as of June 26) to $250 (as of June 20) for the most affordable options, with prices on StubHub ranging from $150 to $199 for the same two shows. It may be a good idea to check resale vendors first before looking at original tickets, as it's possible to score a closer ticket for a lower price at this time. If you are interested in VIP packages, Ticketmaster is likely the best option.VIP packages for the 2026 shows start at about $890 and increase from there, depending on the selected package. VIP tickets included a choice of standing or premium reserved seats, priority entrance into Sphere Las Vegas, merch, and more. In addition to VIP concert tickets, some packages include hotel stays at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas (The Venetian or The Palazzo). Packages are priced starting at $926 for a general hotel and concert experience, or $1,358 for a VIP hotel and concert experience package. Details regarding the VIP package can be found on Ticketmaster’s partner site Vibee.For Kenny Chesney’s Tortuga Music Festival appearance, prices are on the higher end (starting at $520 for StubHub and $506 for Vivid Seats) in comparison to his Sphere performances; however, this is due to the ticket including entry to a festival, which encompasses several artists and activities to participate in.Who is opening for Kenny Chesney’s residency?For Kenny Chesney’s 2025 Sphere residency, the opening act was DJ Brandi Cyrus. Chesney said that he felt a DJ, rather than a band, was the best choice to get the party started, as he wanted people to dance on the open floor.While we couldn’t find an official announcement at this time regarding a 2026 opener, it can be expected that he may do something similar to his previous Sphere performances next year as well.Will there be international tour dates?Kenny Chesney had no performances scheduled outside Las Vegas during his 2026 residency and appearance at the Tortuga Music Festival in April.Will Kenny Chesney tour in 2026?Kenny Chesney is only scheduled to continue his Las Vegas residency in June. It is possible, however, that he may add performances or festival appearances outside those mentioned in the future.

Trump: Will allow Nvidia to ship H200 products to approved customers in China, U.S. to get 25%Closing Bell: OvertimePresident Donald Trump on Monday said Nvidia will be allowed to ship its H200 artificial intelligence chips to \"approved customers\" in China and elsewhere, on the condition that the U.S. gets a 25% cut.Chinese President Xi Jinping \"responded positively\" to the proposal, Trump wrote in a Truth Social post.The policy \"will support American Jobs, strengthen U.S. Manufacturing, and benefit American Taxpayers,\" Trump wrote.\"The Department of Commerce is finalizing the details, and the same approach will apply to AMD, Intel, and other GREAT American Companies,\" he added in the post.Both Nvidia and chip rival AMD, short for Advanced Micro Devices, agreed in August to share 15% of the revenue from China chip sales with the U.S. government. But around that same time, China reportedly warned companies against using the H20 AI chip that Nvidia designed especially for the country.The H200 is a higher-grade chip than the H20, but not the company's top-of-the-line product.Nvidia shares climbed earlier Monday on news that the Commerce Department was set to approve the China sales, but later pared those gains. The stock rose about 2% after hours.Nvidia (NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) stock prices\"We applaud President Trump's decision to allow America's chip industry to compete to support high paying jobs and manufacturing in America,\" a spokesman from Nvidia told CNBC in a statement. \"Offering H200 to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America,\" the spokesman said.Semiconductors, which are key components in nearly every category of electronics, are at the center of the AI race between the U.S. and China.They have also played a role in the tumultuous trade relationship between the two economic superpowers.Read more CNBC tech newsBlackRock bets on 'pick and shovel' trade, singling out clear winners in AI spending spreeElon Musk calls for abolition of European Union after X fined $140 millionJudge finalizes remedies in Google antitrust caseSalesforce shares pop 5%, continuing post-earnings rally and pushing stock to best week since 2023When Beijing imposed export controls on rare-earth minerals, which are used in the production of some high-end chips, the Trump administration threatened to massively increase tariffs on U.S. imports from China.After meeting in South Korea in late October, Trump and Xi struck a tentative trade truce in which China committed to end \"retaliation\" against U.S. chipmakers, according to the White House.Trump said after that meeting that he discussed the export of Nvidia chips with Xi.— CNBC's Kristina Partsinevelos and Kif Leswing contributed to this report.",

Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison wrote in the memo to staffers, which was first obtained by Business Insider.The Paramount CEO said he believes his all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD is superior to Netflix's $27.75 offer for WBD's streaming and studio assets, including the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, and streamer HBO Max.Paramount made a so-called hostile bid for WBD on Monday morning, hoping to get investors on its side.Ellison is also trying to get his employees on board. He's selling them on a vision where a Paramount-WBD tie-up becomes a powerhouse capable of challenging Netflix and YouTube.\"Our motivation for pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery has been consistent from the start,\" Ellison wrote in the memo. \"We love this industry and believe deeply in its future.\"Ellison also said that \"storytelling\" is \"one of America's greatest cultural and economic exports.\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos similarly made an America-focused pitch when he approached President Donald Trump about the deal, he said at an industry conference on Monday afternoon.\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.Netflix has said its proposal would be best for consumers and the entertainment industry. Paramount has made the opposite argument.Read Ellison's full memo to Paramount employees below:Dear Team,This morning, we filed a tender offer — a public offer to purchase shares directly from a company's shareholders — and made an appeal to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders to acquire WBD for $30 per share in cash.You can read the details in our press release here, but in short, we believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole. Together, we would form a scaled, forward-looking company positioned to invest confidently in future growth and capitalize on rapidly changing industry dynamics — while better serving creative talent and consumers. A combined company would give us the reach, resources, and creative capacity to tell more exceptional stories and bring them to audiences around the world.We are taking our offer directly to shareholders because they deserve full transparency and the ability to make an informed choice. Our $30 per share, all cash proposal is superior to Netflix's offer — $27.75 in total, including $23.25 in cash — across every dimension: higher overall value, greater certainty, a clearer regulatory path, and a future that is pro-Hollywood, pro-consumer, and pro-competition.Our motivation for pursuing Warner Bros. Discovery has been consistent from the start. We love this industry and believe deeply in its future. And we want to help preserve and strengthen one of America's greatest cultural and economic exports: storytelling. By bringing Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery together, we aim to accelerate both creative engines, delivering a greater slate of high-quality films, television, sports, news, and games to global audiences.Bottom line: this transaction is about doing more, not less — for our company, for the industry, for consumers, for shareholders, and especially for the creative talent who power everything we do. We're energized by the opportunity ahead, and we're confident that once Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders have the chance to decide for themselves, they'll choose Paramount.As this process moves forward, I pledge to keep you informed whenever there are significant updates. Until then, let's stay focused on our North Star priorities and continue pressing ahead. I remain deeply grateful for your hard work, dedication, and passion.Let's go!David",

As tickets have just gone on sale and demand is high, you may find more favorable seating and pricing options from these sites. We recommend reviewing all available options for the date and location you wish to attend before making your purchase.How much are Bon Jovi tickets?Prices vary for Bon Jovi’s upcoming Forever tour depending on the date, location, and demand for each show. On Ticketmaster, original standard tickets, particularly for the New York residency, are in incredibly high demand, with remaining options ranging in the high hundreds to over $1,000 for some premium seating options. In general, the high prices seem to be a result of most affordable seating options having already sold out during the current ongoing presale.Vivid Seats and StubHub, on the other hand, currently offer a wider variety of seating and pricing options, providing more affordable choices overall for those looking to attend the shows on a budget. Both sites have affordable options ranging from $237 to around $300 for the New York performances. Please note that, as of the time of writing, the July 19 New York show, which was most recently announced, has not yet gone on sale. International shows are more affordable on StubHub, starting at £151 for both UK performances, with Vivid Seats offering prices starting at $394. Generally, Vivid Seats tends to offer more limited options for international performances, whereas StubHub often provides a wider variety. The Dublin show is presently not available on either platform.There are several VIP packages being offered on Ticketmaster for Bon Jovi’s upcoming Forever tour. Full details of all four packages, the “Legendary” Front Row & Side Stage VIP experience, “Forever” VIP experience, Premium Superfan VIP fan package, and Superfan VIP fan package, can be viewed on Ticketmaster. All packages include premium tickets as well as various perks such as signed merchandise, dedicated VIP staff, VIP lounge access, exclusive gifts, and early entry. Ticketmaster also has limited quantities of VIP packages that include hotel stays as well. We were able to find one Superfan VIP fan package ticket for the July 9 show listed on Ticketmaster for $686 (at the time of writing); however, other shows appear to have no options remaining.Who is opening for Bon Jovi’s tour?Openers for the coming Forever tour have not yet been officially announced. In the past, Bon Jovi has regularly supported other artists, including local ones, as openers for their concert tours. Previous years have seen One Republic, Skid Row, Cinderella, Van Halen, Queensrÿche, Daughtry, Kid Rock, and Nickelback support Bon Jovi onstage. With the tour set to start next July, it is expected that more information will become available as the kick-off grows closer.Will there be international tour dates?The Forever tour will include a five-show residency in New York, followed by three international performances in Edinburgh, Dublin, and London.Does Bon Jovi still tour?Bon Jovi’s tour, the Forever tour, is the first in four years and is set to kick off in July 2026. The coming tour marks the first for Bon Jovi since lead singer Jon Bon Jovi underwent vocal cord surgery in 2022.What songs will Bon Jovi perform in concert?Since the Forever tour has yet to start, we can't say for certain what songs the band will perform as part of their setlist. Based on their last tour in 2022, here are some songs that might be included in the performance:\"Livin' on a Prayer\"\"You Give Love a Bad Name\"\"The Radio Saved My Life Tonight\"\"We Weren't Born to Follow\"\"It's My Life\"\"Beautiful Drug\"\"Born to Be My Baby\"\"This House Is Not For Sale\"\"Just Older\"\"Let It Rain\"\"Keep the Faith\"\"American Reckoning\"\"Whole Lot of Leavin'\"\"Do What You Can\"\"I'll Sleep When I'm Dead\"\"Lost Highway\"\"Roller Coaster\"\"Who Says You Can't Go Home\"\"Wanted Dead or Alive\"\"Bad Medicine\"\"I'll Be There For You\"\n\n Nicole Berardi\n\n Freelance Writer\n\n Nicole Berardi is a freelance contributor for Insider Reviews, covering a variety of stories such as how to buy tickets and Airbnb reviews.Having graduated Cum Laude from Rutgers University with a degree in Journalism and Media Studies, Nicole spent the next decade living in Japan, embracing her passion for travel across the continent of Asia.When not writing, Nicole spends her time looking for the best restaurants in New York City, taking photos of her cat, and enjoying a good matcha latte.\n\n Read more\n Read less",

    "fullText": "Quince Mongolian Cashmere Crewneck\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n The super soft Quince Mongolian Cashmere Crewneck Sweater feels more expensive than it is, and it's obvious why it's such a hit. It's main difference from Naadam's ($98) is that it's slightly thinner and not as smooth. I tested the newest Cashmere 2.0 version, which costs the same and felt slightly thicker than the original, but it's not as good as Naadam in terms of softness.I only wash my cashmere as needed in order to make it last. The Quince sweater feels thinner than Naadam's after washing, but I still don't find it any less wearable.Of course, the price tag on Quince's 100% Grade-A Mongolian cashmere is attractive when you see that it's practically identical to Naadam's. The patterns are the exact same (unless I'm really nitpicking — Quince's neckline is bound with a seam that looks slightly more unfinished and liable to fray). But the quality is acceptable and consistent with other Quince cashmere pieces I've tested. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead more in my full Naadam vs. Quince cashmere sweater review.\n\n Quince Responsible Down Puffer Jacket\n\n Sally Kaplan, Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n \"The Quince puffer is insulated with 700+ fill power, so it'll keep you warm below freezing temperatures. The outer shell is wind-resistant and treated with a PFC-free DWR water-repellent finish to keep snow out. It also has a bungee hem when you need to better trap body heat.It's nearly identical to (but $100 cheaper than) The Super Puff, with the same removable hood, thumbhole wrist cuffs, and extra pockets. The Aritzia coat was slightly warmer (though our executive editor, Sally Kaplan, didn't feel a big difference here during testing) and comes in a lot more color options, but if you don't need either of those features, the Quince Puffer saves you a hundred bucks.The outer shell and lining are made with 100% recycled polyester, the down fill is responsibly sourced, and it's made by a brand that is committed to sustainability and fair manufacturing prices.\" — Rachael Schultz, freelance writer, Insider ReviewsSee more in our guide to the best winter coats for women.\n\n Quince Cashmere Lined Leather Gloves\n\n Rachael Schultz/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Quince is one of our favorite sources for affordable cashmere, though the quality of its leather can be unpredictable. Of all the Quince leather pieces I've tested, the brown can look sort of flat in person — which is why I recommend going for the black Quince Leather Gloves.\n\nThis pair has a timeless design, and the naturally insulating, moisture-wicking cashmere lining will keep your hands toasty warm and dry. Skip these if you're sensitive to lanolin though, as the fibers could irritate your skin. See our guide to the best shoe polishes for a leather conditioner you can use to prevent them from becoming dry and cracked.\" — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Italian Leather Triple Compartment Shopper Tote\n\n Samantha Crozier, Quince/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Style editor Samantha Crozier tested dozens of the best work bags for women to find durable totes to take to the office. Her favorite affordable pick is this simple carryall, which has tiny metal feet to keep its base off the floor, as well as a sleek leather exterior that looks more expensive than it is.\"If there's one criticism I have of this bag, it's the lack of pockets with zippers,\" she writes. \"The only zippered compartment is the center pocket that's meant for a laptop. Other than that, there are three open pockets in the interior that are big enough for a cell phone.\n\nThe tote is also not lined, which doesn't make too much of a difference when you're using it, but the interior is not as luxurious as most of the bags on this list. However, it does mean that the interior is wipe-clean, which is blessedly low maintenance.\"\n\n Quince 100% Washable Silk Skirt\n\n Lauren Savoie, Kinsley Searles, Jaclyn Turner/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Perfect for holiday parties, this washable silk skirt comes in standard and extended sizes and is woven in shades of rich burgundy, chocolate, and more.\n\n\"This is a piece I know I'll keep wearing all season long. It can be styled so many ways, whether with an oversized sweater or a little tee,\" writes our senior home editor Jaclyn Turner in our Quince plus-size review. \"I'm between an XL and a 1X, and I appreciate the roominess of the 1X. I recommend sizing up if you want a smoother fit since the silk is quite clingy.\"\n\n\"The thick silk feels premium and cascades beautifully,\" says associate editor Kinsley Searles, who also tried this silk skirt. \"There's no zipper — instead it pulls on and the elastic band sits firmly in place. But while the elastic waistband is flexible, it's important to note that the silk itself is not stretchy.\"Read more in our full Quince washable silk review.\n\n Quince Italian Suede Penny Loafer\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Quince undercuts many brands featured in our guide to the best loafers for women. This pair has many of the same features as the Glove Flats, like genuine Italian leather and Ortholite insoles.\n\nI tested these against Margaux's Andie leather loafers ($345), and the Quince loafers proved to a better bang for your buck. The main drawback is that the black suede around the toes got a little faded the more I wore them, so I recommend choosing the Almond colorway to keep them looking newer for longer. \n\nThat being said, I'm still impressed at how much they look and perform like Margaux loafers. The stacked leather heel is actually sturdy, and inside the leather is soft and molded to my feet.  I don't suggest these for wide feet or sensitive high arches, but they fit me (size US 8) comfortably and true to size. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Italian Wool Double-Breasted Slouch Coat\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Besides the perfectly oversized fit, the thing I love most about this dress coat is that it's lined on the inside for added warmth. Many slouch coats are made without a lining because the lack of added structure allows the wool to drape more loosely. While that may give you a slightly more cozy silhouette, it means you miss out on any real insulation. The lining here gives the coat just enough structure to feel sophisticated and clean, but clever details like a shoulder seam that continues down the arm still gives it an almost cape-like, drop-shoulder fit.I would personally recommend opting for the black color over the tan. While the tan might look nice in online photos, I can tell that the color is pretty flat, which means it won't look quite as elegant in person. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Carry-On Hard Shell Suitcase\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This carry-on bag was really easy to wheel around, and I was grateful for its smoothness when navigating the subway. I tested both this version and the Front Pocket version, but the pocket was pretty useless and only made it bulkier, so I recommend saving the extra $30 and going with the pocketless version. \n\nThis hardshell style is lightweight, but not flimsy. I like that the inside has a removable mesh pocket and a zipped pouch that unfurls and can be easily tucked away when not in use. I use it whenever I need to pack about four days worth of outfits and toiletries.It comes with its own magic eraser to wipe off scuff marks, but I honestly don't think it's worth the extra effort just for it to become scuffed the next time I use it. If you're concerned about scratches, you'd better get a protective sleeve or choose a soft-shell suitcase instead. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider ReviewsRead more in our full Quince luggage review.\n\n Quince Double-Faced Merino Wool Scarf Coat\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This wool scarf coat sold out last season before I could try it, but I've been keen to test out this designer dupe. It's Quince's version of the Toteme Embroidered Scarf Jacket ($1130), which is a street-style favorite among fashion editors. Toteme's is made of a wool-poly blend, while the Quince coat is 100% Merino wool. \n\nThis coat may look warm and cozy because of its oversized fit, but the felt-like material is actually quite thin. It works better as a stylish top layer than an actual coat. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Mongolian Cashmere Midi Turtleneck Sweater Dress\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n The midi-length counterpart to the Mongolian Cashmere Turtleneck dress is a solid option if you want a dress with more coverage. It's pretty roomy around the middle, so it's best to size down if you want a more fitted look. Otherwise, if you have a statement belt you've been wanting to break out, you can wear it to draw in the waist on this dress. The turtleneck is high enough to reach my chin so it's a great option for keeping warm while still looking polished. It has side slits to allow my legs to move easily, and the skirt length hits me a bit past my knees. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Italian Leather Glove Ballet Flat\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Everlane's Day Glove Flats currently hold the top spot in our guide to the best flats, and are a long-standing favorite of executive editor Sally Kaplan. In our Everlane Day Glove flats review, she says, \"there exists on this earth no better flat.\" However, the Quince Italian Leather Glove Ballet Flats may be a substitute.\n\nAlong with several other of Quince's dupes, these Day Glove-lookalikes sold out almost as soon as they became available. Upon first inspection, they are practically indistinguishable from Everlane's. They even have the same pull-tabs and perforations around the inner arches to help ventilate the shoe — which is good, because the leather can and will get sweaty inside. The leather has some give, but if you have extra wide feet, I'd skip these. It's also worth noting that Quince doesn't offer them in narrow or half sizes, but Everlane does. I wear a size 8 and these have a nearly true-to-size fit that lean a tad tight, especially around the top seam.\n\nI found Quince's Glove flats to likewise have zero break-in time — as soon as I slipped them on, they felt like wearing soft leather slippers. I like how much traction their rubber soles have compared to other flats I've tried, and their Ortholite insoles provide cushioning below the arches. \n\nThe material is 100% Italian cow Nappa leather and made in Shenzhen, China, while Everlane claims their Day Glove is made in Santa Maria a Monte, Italy. The key distinction Quince makes on their site is that their version is less than half the price of Everlane's, so if you're looking for an affordable alternative to a cult favorite, this is the right pair. I'll be curious to see if they hold up for as long as two years, as the Day Gloves did for Sally. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Tencel Rib Knit Sleeveless Dress\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n My favorite part of this midi dress is how stretchy the fabric feels, and I appreciate that it's thin without being flimsy. On the inside is a light lining that's slightly compressive, but the split hem in the rear makes it so that you can still take long strides comfortably. It's an ideal travel dress because it rolls up into a tidy bundle and tucks neatly into my carry-on. \n\nIt's a great value on a casual lounge dress compared to similar styles from Athleta or Lululemon. It also comes in a long-sleeve version you can wear during the colder months. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Silk Slip Dress\n\n Samantha Crozier/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n The Quince silk slip dress revealed to us the true nature of the brand's clothing. It's a flattering, classic style that style editor Samantha Crozier was able to wash and wear for about nine months until it finally tore. That being said, it's an easy dress to throw on, with a beautiful sheen that makes you feel polished in no matter where you wear it — and it's highly affordable for genuine silk.\"The dress is only $89.90. When I was on the hunt for a silk dress, I mulled over dresses as high as $250 for days, wondering if I could justify the price. For me, this dress is the perfect combination of price, style, and fit,\" says Crozier. \n\nYou're likely to get a lot of use from this dress before you experience the same disappointment. It also recently became available in extended sizes. However, its shelf life does put it in the category of fast fashion, so we can't call it a sustainable option.\n\nRead more in our full Quince silk slip dress review.\n\n Quince 100% Silk Twill Button Front Mini Dress\n\n Sally Kaplan/Business Insider. \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I've tested a lot of washable silk from brands like Quince and Everlane, and I've gotta say, it's never really that great (stay with me though, because I like this dress!). The silk almost always ends up dulling over time and the material is really too thin to stand up to a washing machine. It's not so much the stitching as it is the Denier of the silk itself — it just doesn't have the strength to withstand the pulling motions of a machine. That's why I only opt for washable silk pieces that aren't meant to be worn all the time, like this dress.Even though I'll be dry cleaning it instead of machine washing, I think it's worth taking good care of clothes you really like, and I really like this one. It's easy to style with or without a belt, though if you're super short like me (I'm 5-foot-2), you might be better off using a belt to shorten the dress a little. I love the slight balloon sleeve detail, too, which gives this dress a bit of extra volume. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince 100% European Linen Scoop Neck Midi Dress\n\n Samantha Crozier/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This linen dress from Quince is a great staple piece that I know I'll be wearing a lot this summer. I love the fact that it has pockets, which is a huge win for functionality. The shirred back is also a flattering touch, since it emphasizes your waist. Most linen dresses are pretty sheath-like, so I like that this one has some structure to it.But I'm not a fan of how this dress is lined. Instead of a full-length lining, it stops right at the knees. You can't see this unless you're hanging out in the sun, but that's exactly what this dress was made for. This makes it look like the dress cuts you in an awkward way and is another example of how Quince gets it almost right, but how cost-saving measures get in the way of producing a truly great piece.This dress does come in eight colorways, including pinstripes, gingham, and more — and I'm sure the awkward lining length would be much less visible in a non-white color. — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Business Insider Reviews.\n\n Quince Tencel Jersey Fit & Flare Dress\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I wanted to test this comfy dress straight out of the bag in came in, and it proved its versatility immediately. The fabric is made from a supremely soft, stretchy blend of Tencel and Spandex, which clings at its top and flows around its midi-length skirt. I was building up a bit of a sweat while vacuuming in it, yet it felt so light and breathable that I kept on wearing it after I'd cooled down.\n\nI'm 5-foot-9 and have a short torso, so the size S fit has more of a drop-waist that flares around the hips. Importantly, though, this dress has two hip pockets — so besides being extremely comfortable, it's also convenient. If you want a version you can really sweat in, Quince offers the same design in its moisture-wicking Flowknit fabric. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Washable Stretch Silk Tiered Maxi Dress\n\n Talia Ergas/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Not every Quince silk dress was up to our standards — the slip dress, for example, tore after over a year of wear — but for the amount of times you're bound to wear and wash this special-occasion dress, it feels worth the price point.\n\n\"While elegant enough to dress up with some heels and a clutch for dinner, I mostly pair [this maxi dress] with sneakers for an elevated and comfortable daytime look. The sneaker look works for me because, at 5-foot-7, the dress hits me right above the ankles, but if you're shorter, it may fall closer to the floor.\n\nOn particularly hot days, I did sweat in this dress (usually I pick sleeveless items when I think I may sweat), and the sweat was fairly visible through the silk fabric. That's the only downside I found to this dress. I washed it cold on the delicates cycle and hung it to dry. I steamed it to remove wrinkles (ironing silk is not recommended). Each time I wore the dress after washing, I found it as soft and shiny as before.\" — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider ReviewsRead more in our full Quince washable silk review.\n\n Quince Distressed Denim Shirt Dress\n\n Rebecca Strong/Business Insider, Quince \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n As long as you have the right pieces to zhuzh it up, we found this 100% cotton button-down to be a great affordable work dress. \n\n\"A denim dress might not be your first thought for workplace attire, but hear me out. They can totally work on casual Fridays, in more laid-back office environments, or dressed up in the right way,\" writes freelance style reporter Rebecca Strong.\"It's a reasonable length, falling to right above my knee, and the denim material feels soft — not stiff, like some. While the dress comes in a variety of washes, I think the darker blue or black are your best bets for a professional setting.\"\n\n Quince Tencel Rib Knit Maxi Slip Dress\n\n Lauren Savoie/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n We had two editors, size 1X and 3X, test pieces from the brand's new extended size collection for our Quince plus size review. There were both hits and misses, but the Tencel Rib Knit material proved to be a unanimous favorite.\n\n\"This piece was the one that was most outside of my comfort zone, so I was surprised that I ended up really liking this style. Silhouette-wise, it's a dead ringer for the viral Skims Long Slip Dress, but priced about $20 cheaper. It's super soft and stretchy, made from a mix of ribbed Tencel and Spandex, and it felt very breathable. This piece has great day-to-night potential — I could see wearing it out to a summer dinner on its own, but I really liked how it looked when paired with a blazer for work. I'm 5'11\", and this dress hit me right around the ankles with shoes on. The adjustable straps help adjust the length a bit, but I'd say if you're shorter than 5'7\", you may need to wear heels with this dress or consider getting it hemmed.\" —Lauren Savoie, deputy editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince 100% European Linen Square Neck Jumpsuit\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n If you're looking for a cozy throw-on outfit, I highly recommend this jumpsuit. Though the legs were a bit long on my 5'1\" frame, the jumpsuit fit like a dream — just roomy enough to layer a turtleneck underneath on chillier spring days, but not so oversized that I couldn't just wear it on its own without my bra showing. The linen isn't particularly hefty, but in the black color, it remains totally opaque.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Cotton Cashmere Ribbed Long Sleeve V-Neck Midi Dress\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This is my one sweater dress to rule them all: it has just 3% cashmere, so it's soft without being itchy if you're sensitive to lanolin. I like that the fabric is heavyweight and stretchy, and how comfortable and clingy the fit feels. \n\nI also love that there's a tie in the rear so I can pull it tighter around my waist, preventing it from becoming another lumpy, misshapen sweater dress. It's proven worth the $70, since I've worn it at least once a week in the span of a month. With a quick switch of accessories, this sweater dress can be transformed from a cozy loungewear look to a semi-formal outfit.\n\nRead more about its versatility in my full Quince sweater dress review. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Cashmere Turtleneck Sweater Dress\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n A winter dress as comfy as it is warm, Quince's cashmere turtleneck frock (available in five cozy hues) is a great dressier staple for colder months. My body is pear-shaped, and even though I sized up to a large, the dress was still very fitted around my bottom half, so I probably wouldn't choose this one first for professional settings. Still, it's a great piece to throw on with a pair of calf-height heel boots for an evening out. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Tencel Jersey Tank Maxi Dress\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I love the simplicity of this tank dress, but the high slit gives it a flirty feel that elevates it a bit. I found the material to be ever-so-slightly sheer when I bent over, so I recommend sizing up for a little extra give when you bend or move around. I opted for a large, which is my usual size, but I could have gone up to the XL for a bit more room. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince 100% Organic Cotton Poplin Tiered Maxi Dress\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This organic cotton poplin dress is a great dupe for the popular Somerset dress from Anthropologie at less than half the price. It comes in eleven color options, including this bright reddish-orange color, and while the cotton material has no stretch, the dress has elastic at the waist for flexibility with the sizing. On the model, it hits mid-calf, but on my 5'1\" frame, it was a full-length maxi dress. I'll definitely be wearing this on date nights and warm weather outings! — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince 100% European Linen Smocked Mini Dress\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I've found that linen clothing isn't Quince's strong suit, and while this dress is lightweight, it doesn't feel durable. My other wish for its design would be to add some silicone grips where the sleeves sit on the shoulders, because the elastic feels scratchy on bare skin. \n\nI got the size small, which has a pretty short hemline for a 5'9\" frame — to put it in terms of your average middle school dress code, this length would just barely be passing. But the stretchy bodice and billowy sleeves fit just right, and the skirt has a nice swing to it, so I'm still bound to get a decent amount of use from it. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Organic Heavyweight Fleece Set\n\n Amir Ismael/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Some might consider sweatsuits to be activewear, but for me, it's just something easy and comfortable to throw on when I don't need to be dressed for a particular occasion. Over the years, I've tested well over a dozen sweatsuits from different brands and Quince is one of the best — the price makes it even better. If I had to guess the MSRP on the crewneck sweatshirt and fleece jogger before knowing how affordable the brand is, I would've said $80 each.Both the top and bottom are made of 375g heavyweight organic cotton fleece, which makes them warmer and softer than most other options at this price. Smaller details like metal tips on the drawstrings and a hidden zippered smartphone pocket also make the set feel very premium.I could have gone with a size small for a better fit, but I prefer the extra space of the size medium. And don't worry about the wrinkles; I've been wearing this set strictly for comfort.   — Amir Ismael, senior reporter, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince SuperSoft Fleece Sweatsuit\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Check price at Quince\n\n During the pandemic, we wrote a lot about the best loungewear you can buy, so I tested probably 10-15 lounge sets while working from home. I wish I had known about this set sooner, because it's definitely my new favorite! The material is relatively thin and lined with a super soft fleece that feels like you're wearing a cloud. The wide-leg pants fell in just the right place on my calf, and I love that they're versatile enough to pair with other tops besides the matching sweatshirts. The crew fit really well, and though it wasn't cropped by design, it tucked into the high-waisted pants without billowing out too much.  It took two or three washes to stop seeing little bits of fuzz lingering behind on the inside, so I recommend putting it through the laundry before your first wear.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Washable Stretch Silk Notch Collar Blouse\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I've long searched for the perfect white button-up, but of the ones I've tried, many were just too see-through. For that reason, I was skeptical about trying this blouse in white, but I was impressed at how opaque it was, only showing the faintest outline of my tan bra in certain spots. Still, it felt polished enough to wear in a business setting if you're intent on finding where to shop for women's workwear clothes. I sized up to a medium (I'm usually in between small and medium in tops), which was a good choice. The fit is roomy and relaxed but not oversized. It looks great tucked into a pair of high-waisted jeans or layers nicely under Quince's Baby Alpaca Wool Cropped Sweater. Like the skirt, the washable silk blouse comes in fifteen colors. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Mongolian Cashmere Fisherman Vest\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Quince's fisherman knit is one of my favorite patterns I've tried from its cashmere collection — it's chunky, structured, but still very soft. This vest is made from a 7 gauge cashmere, meaning it's lightweight and ideal for layering. It has a long, boxy, slightly oversized fit, so size down if you prefer your waistline to be visible. I'm wearing this on it's own for a casual look, but it looks very smart worn atop a white button-down. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Australian Merino Wool Half Zip Sweater\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This Merino wool half-zip has a chunky knit like a fisherman sweater, and it's really easy to layer with because of the loose, oversized fit. Wearing this has made me realize I actually love a half-zip closure because I can loosen it when I pull it over my head and it won't mess up my hair or smudge my makeup. Then once it's on, I zip it back up and it keeps my neck warm. \n\nI like the chunky lower gauge knit for this kind of sweater because it feels heavyweight and insulating without suffocating me around the neckline. And for the price, you really can't do much better on a Merino wool sweater of this quality. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Mongolian Cashmere Fisherman Crewneck Sweater\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Of all the best cashmere sweaters we've tested, Quince has my favorite affordable options. This style is better suited for colder temperatures than the original Cashmere Crewneck. It isn't necessarily as chunky as you'd expect from a classic fisherman's sweater, but the density is still plenty enough to stay warm with. Here I'm wearing it with one of favorite scarves, the matching Mongolian Cashmere Scarf. I wear this sweater all winter long (even to bed) because it's so soft and comfortable. It fit me true to size, though next time I'd size up so the sleeves can fall further past my wrists. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Baby Alpaca-Wool Cropped Cardigan\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This one might be my absolute favorite sweater that I own. Originally, I was drawn to the ivory version, but then I read reviews of the white colorway being a bit see-through, so I chose the similar light gray version instead. I love that I can wear this cardigan totally on its own, or layer it over a collared blouse or basic tee. Its oversized buttons give it a nice vintage feel, as if it came straight from grandpa's closet, but its blouson sleeves modernize and elevate the look.Although the cardigan is described as cropped on the website, for me, it hit right at the top of my hips (and I have a longer torso), so semi-cropped might be a more accurate descriptor. The best part: it's snuggly warm and not even remotely itchy. I have never been able to wear a wool sweater without a tank underneath due to the itching, but this one made it possible. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Organic Cotton Boyfriend Crew\n\n Sally Kaplan/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Slightly cropped and perfectly midweight, this cotton sweater is a real winner through the seasons. I love to half-tuck it into jeans or drape it around my shoulders. The design is simple but executed well for the price point, and you'll get the cost-per-wear down in no time because it's so versatile. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Organic Cotton Cropped Cardigan\n\n Sally Kaplan/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I love a cropped cardigan and this one in the color Cement Marl (one of seven) features heavily in my wardrobe. I find myself reaching for it week after week, though it has admittedly stretched out a little over time and the button placard has gotten a bit misshapen with regular wear and washing. I could have done more to prevent this by only laying it flat to dry, but I'm lazy so I put it through the dryer all the time. If you take care of this as you should, it'll last you a lot longer before it starts to stretch out.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince 100% Organic Cotton Oversized Cardigan\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I'm allergic to wool, so every time I find an oversized cotton sweater or cardigan, I get extra excited. After testing this one from Quince, I consider the brand a top selection for the best sweaters for women and am definitely planning to buy it in more colors! I love the swingy, oversized fit, and the weight of it is substantial enough that I don't worry about it stretching or shrinking.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Cashmere Turtleneck\n\n Amir Ismael/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I'm all about having a unique selection of different knit sweaters for the winter, but if there's one basic style I have to have in my closet, it's a black turtleneck. I can dress it up or down and it makes for a great base layer. With matching black jeans, a black turtleneck goes well with almost any combination of jacket, shoes, and hat. This past winter season, Quince's Mongolian Cashmere Turtleneck Sweater was my go-to.When it comes to cashmere, I'm less concerned about the brand name and more about the quality of the materials. After all, you'll never see the branding, but the material is what's next to your skin. Made from 100% Grade A Mongolian Cashmere, I didn't have any issues wearing Quince's Cashmere sweater directly on my skin for hours at a time. I've come across quite a few sweaters in the same price range — some for even less — but they're notoriously itchy. At that point, they're not worth the savings.  — Amir Ismael, men's style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead more in our full Quince cashmere review.\n\n Quince Cashmere Batwing Sweater\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This slouchy, casual-but-polished sweater has become my go-to for Zoom calls. The fit is perfectly oversized — I'm usually between a small and a medium in tops and the S/M fits me well with room to spare — which makes it great for layering on top of a long-sleeve shirt or tank. Thanks to the longer tunic-style length, it looks great with a pair of leggings or jeans but can also be worn over a midi skirt for a more elevated look. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Flowknit Pullover Hoodie\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I was hoping Quince's Flowknit fabric would feel similar to some of my other favorites from Vuori or Outdoor Voices — and indeed, it did. Quince's version is still buttery soft and super stretchy, but it's much more affordable than its competitors. This heathered hoodie is perfect for both workouts and running errands.I love the thumb loops and the sleeves are extra-long, which is great for me since I'm 5'7\", but I imagine they might be a bit too long for more petite people. My only wish is that Quince offered it in more colors to match more of their Ultra-Soft Performance Leggings, because the two make such a cute set. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Ultra-Stretch Ponte Super Wide Leg Pant\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Quince's Ponte collection includes this billowy wide-leg pair that have now become a staple in my workwear wardrobe. These stretchy work pants feel like sweatpants, but have the polished appearance of slacks. They pull on effortlessly with a concealed zipper and clasp at the hip, and the extra high-rise waistband is comfortable enough to sit in all day. I'm five-foot-nine, so I was pleased to learn these come in a 32-inch inseam that falls past my ankles. The material is thin, so in the winter I wear leggings underneath to stay warm. They're not entirely wrinkle-resistant, but I'd still recommend them to anyone who's looking for a solid pair of black work pants they can lounge in. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince 100% Organic Cotton Poplin A-line Maxi Skirt\n\n Sally Kaplan/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This white poplin skirt isn't just my new favorite style from Quince, it's maybe one of my favorite pieces of clothing ever. It's not see-through at all thanks to a thin cotton lining under the poplin, but it still remains super breezy and light. I love the length on my very short frame, but even if you're taller, you can wear it at different spots on your waist to get a shorter or longer fit. I'm a sucker for an elastic waist band (comfy clothes only!) and anything with pockets (yes, it has pockets!!!), so basically this is my dream skirt and I'll be wearing it as often as my laundry schedule allows. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Bella Stretch Straight Jeans\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I tested these high-rise straight jeans from Quince's first denim collection, and during my first try-on, they seem to look and feel just like a pair of Mother Denim jeans I thrifted years ago (which probably originally cost over $200). Quince jeans cost only $50, so this comparison proves to me that Quince denim is worth trying if you're on a budget. They're certainly not luxury quality — Quince's are too thin and stretchy — but for the price, they're just okay.\n\nPeople with an hourglass figure who struggle to fit their hip-to-waist ratio will appreciate this stretchy high-rise waistband. When I held them up to myself in the mirror, I assumed they'd be too tight around the hips, but the elastic factor is impressive. They hug my curves and give me a subtle lift in the seat area. I even found that they lightly compress around my waist, so there's no gap around my middle. \n\nQuince advises that these run big — for reference, I'm 5'9\" and ordered a size 27. I'm about 38 inches around the hip, and found that the stretchiness allowed for the perfect amount of wiggle room. \n\nI tend to wear my jeans many times between washes, so I've yet to see how this pair fades over time. But in the meantime, I'm wearing these stretchy jeans with my favorite flats and looking forward to more size-inclusive options in the next Quince denim release. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider ReviewsRead more in our full Quince jeans review.\n\n Quince Ultra-Soft Bike Short\n\n Julia Guerra/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n When Quince named its \"Ultra-Soft Bike Short,\" they weren't being hyperbolic. I'd go as far as to say \"ultra\" is an understatement.Trust me, I've tested a lot of activewear in my career; this is the softest material I've ever put on my body. The style is constructed from 84% recycled polyester (sourced from about 4 to 5 recycled PET bottles) and 16% Spandex. It boasts a 4-way stretch, adding to its comfortability, and while it keeps everything secure and smooth, it's not restrictive. I've worn them for low-impact yoga flows and mat pilates, paired them with a sweatshirt for all-day wear, and I would probably feel comfortable sleeping in them, too. — Julia Guerra, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Washable Silk Skirt\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n A silk skirt is such a versatile wardrobe staple. It pairs well with sneakers and a t-shirt or slouchy sweater for a casual ensemble or can be worn with heels and a matching silky camisole for a dressy evening look. I was super excited to try Quince's version, which comes in an impressive range of nine colors.This skirt, which hits just below the knees, did not disappoint. I'm currently between a medium and a large in bottoms, and sizing up to a large ended up being the right call. The elastic waistband falls loosely at my hips and the skirt is plenty flowy, so it doesn't show any panty lines.  — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Ultra-Soft High-Rise Legging\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n These moisture-wicking leggings are made from approximately seven recycled water bottles each, which you wouldn't expect based on how soft and stretchy they feel. The pants, available in 11 colors, have a 25-inch inseam and a super high waist. I wore them cycling and they stayed put throughout my entire workout. They're the perfect partner for the Pullover Hoodie above. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince 100% European Linen Pants\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n These pants were the biggest miss of the bunch for me, and I think it had more to do with the color than the execution. The pants themselves are super lightweight and great to throw on over a swimsuit for a pool day, but the white color (which looked more beige on the site) is stark and sheer. The elastic waist at least gives you some flexibility in terms of sizing, plus it makes the pants extra comfy.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Water Repellent Windbreaker Jacket\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This lightweight, packable windbreaker is derivative of lululemon's Always Effortless jacket. I wore it on a day that New York City experienced its largest 1-hour temperature drop ever. I was in the park basking in the sunlight, it was a balmy 79 degrees, and I was convinced spring had sprung. But by the time I'd walked home, it was cloudy and 53 degrees. \n\nI was so glad I had packed this jacket in my tote bag — it takes up almost no space, and it has stowable hood in case of rain. This hood packs into the tall stand collar, and it's wide enough to actually fit over my hair. I usually wear a size S, but I sized up to an M and it was the right call, since this jacket's a bit cropped. One detail I loved is that its zippers match the fabric perfectly, so it has a true monochromatic look.\n\nYou can wear this jacket to exercise, since it's lined with a soft mesh and has a vent in the rear to circulate air. Or, use it as a stylish, sporty top layer on those days with hard-to-predict forecasts. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Shearling Collar Leather Flight Jacket\n\n Amir Ismael/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n \"The leather looks slightly aged for a vintage look, the shearling is both stylish and warm when popped up and worn around the neck, and the hardware feels solid and sturdy. I've seen similarly priced jackets made using faux leather and shearling that completely miss the mark for me.Quince's version is the ideal solution for anyone who doesn't want to spend close to $1,000 (or more, depending on the brand) on a flight jacket. Yes, you'll sacrifice some quality — especially when it comes to seam construction and tailoring — but it's worth it to me for the cost savings.\" — Amir Ismael, men's style editor, Insider ReviewsRead more in our full Quince Shearling Leather Flight Jacket review.\n\n Quince 100% Leather Shirt Jacket\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Leather shirt jackets are a wardrobe staple that can carry you through every season, and this one from Quince is a really affordable option — though there are some clear reasons why. While it's made from real leather, most of the paneling inside of the shirt is unlined. That means the underside of the leather is exposed, so I can tell just how thin it is. However, it doesn't affect the look of the shirt, so I still think it's a good value for anyone who isn't into synthetic leather but also doesn't want to pay $300+ for a piece like this.In terms of sizing, the sleeves run a little long, but the body of the jacket is true to size. It comes in this mushroom beige as well as black, and it looks super effortless when paired with a T-shirt and some jeans or wide-leg pants. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Eco-Knit Milano Stitch Oversized Shirt Jacket\n\n Sally Kaplan/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I wear this shirt jacket more than maybe any other sweater in the fall and winter. The material is substantial and feels like it costs way more than it does. It can be worn buttoned, unbuttoned, or my favorite, belted with a slip skirt and knee-high boots or flowy pants. Definitely size down — it's very much oversized so even if you opt for a size smaller than you usually buy, you'll still have some room. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Suede Bomber\n\n Amir Ismael/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I've always liked the look of suede bombers, but as someone who owns so many other jackets, it's been hard to justify spending a significant amount of money on a style I didn't necessarily need and would only wear once in a blue moon. Even if your reasoning isn't the same as mine, the fact of the matter is that a quality suede jacket can easily run you $700, if not more. I received the Suede Bomber for the purpose of this Quince review, but I definitely would pay the $150 price tag for it — and I still might grab another in a different colorway (such as their black or brown). It's made from 100% top-grain goat suede leather and it feels like it could be sold for at least three or four times the asking price. After trying it out, it promptly earned a spot in our guide to the best bomber jackets for men.The jacket runs true to size, but don't be afraid to size up for a roomier fit. The models on the site are listed as being 6'0\" and 6' 1\" wearing a medium; I'm 5 '5 \", and the medium also fits me nicely. — Amir Ismael, men's style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Underwear and Bras\n\n Sally Kaplan/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I am a big fan of Quince's MicroModal underwear. I helped to test undies for our guide to the best underwear for women and genuinely thought Tommy John was the only place I'd buy underwear for the rest of my life — until I tried Quince's undies. The quality isn't as long-lasting, but for the price point, I'm personally okay with that.At first, I loved the airy Second Skin material most because it's super lightweight and extremely stretchy, similar to Tommy John's Air Mesh underwear. I've tried the thongs and briefs, as well as the Scoop-Neck Bralette and the Crossover Bralette all in the Second Skin material, but after testing for several months and seeing how they've worn through multiple washes (lots of threads coming loose along the waistband), I'd recommend sticking with the MicroModal underwear instead.The MicroModal underwear is incredibly comfortable and slightly thicker, kind of like super stretchy cotton, so I prefer wearing those pairs with jeans. They are breathable with a comfortable elastic waistband that doesn't dig in whatsoever.   — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Italian Triangle Bikini\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I tested a slew of bikinis to find the best swim tops for small busts, and Quince's string-tie halter top was my favorite of the bunch. I've worn it for two seasons in a row and it still looks like brand new.It's one of the few that didn't give me awkward gaps, and the moveable triangles let you customize their spacing. The fabric is a soft, stretchy material that is of comparable quality to the swimsuits I've tried from Andie and Left On Friday.\n\nI also liked that removable pads weren't bulky or misshapen, and its gold accents are a pretty detail (but be warned: you can't wear them in the sauna, or the metal will burn you). The bottoms are like wearing dental floss, so if you're not into showing lots of cheek, I would skip these.If you want a Quince bikini with more coverage that'll better withstand high-impact activity, I suggest the V-Neck Bikini Top and High Rise Bikini Bottom instead. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince All-Day Neoprene Backpack\n\n Left: Dagne Dover's Dakota Neoprene backpack. Right: The Quince All-Day Backpack.\n\n Jennifer Gonick/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n These two backpacks are nearly identical, but the Dagne Dover version has a few more bells-and-whistles that make it one of our all-time favorite work backpacks. Still, it costs $210, which is pretty steep considering it's not waterproof or made of suede. For a lot cheaper, you can get the luxe neoprene look and most of the same features you want in a college backpack.\n\n\"Both bags feature the same padded laptop sleeve, front exterior pocket with a key ring, two external and one internal water bottle pocket, rear luggage sleeve, and zip-up pouch. In addition to all of this, the Dakota has two extra zip-up pockets inside its front flap, a shoe bag, plus exterior zip-up pockets on either side. The Quince backpack instead has just one,\" writes deals fellow Jennifer Gonnick.\n\nRead more in our full Dagne Dover versus Quince backpack review.\n\n Quince Italian Leather Pouch Travel Set\n\n Talia Ergas/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This 100% top-grain Italian leather makeup bag set is stunning. There are four colors to choose from (I picked olive), and each is outfitted with gold-tone zippers. At $70 for the set, it makes a timeless gift that can be used for years to come.It's pretty basic in the way of organizational features (the larger bag has one flush slip pocket), but being able to divide items between two cases is advantageous. If you're trying to maximize packing space, this is a solid bet.I used the 6.5 x 11 x 3.5-inch bag to stow larger full-size makeup items, and I was able to fit two foundations, a tinted moisturizer, two blushes, five blush/contour/highlight sticks, three lipsticks, a makeup setting spray, and an eyeshadow palette — with room to spare.In the 5 x 9 x 3-inch clamshell, I carried full-size makeup brushes and a concealer. On shorter trips, you could also use the larger bag for travel-size toiletries (the water-resistant microfiber interior can be wiped clean) and the smaller pouch for makeup. I love that the smaller bag can be nested inside the larger one to save space when it's not in use. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Italian Leather Mini Crescent Shoulder Bag\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I like this mini shoulder bag's sculptural shape and its material quality is more than fine, but as we've seen from testing other Quince leather goods in the shade \"Cognac,\" black is really the way to go. This brown color is more muted in person, and the pebbled leather doesn't translate well. It's pretty small, but works well to hold the bare essentials. I consider this as more as an accent piece than a way to carry all my belongings. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Revive Nylon Belt Bag\n\n Gabrielle Chase \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Quince's affordable belt bag is made from 100% water-resistant recycled nylon that's durable and lightweight. I consider it Quince's dupe for the Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag, with a spacious main compartment and smaller mesh interior sleeves, as well as a key leash. It's a bit too bulky to jog with, but it's the perfect size for travel and concerts. If you're shopping for gifts, you can put lip balms, a unique keychain, and other mini accessories in this fanny pack as its own little gift basket. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Italian Leather Quilted Crossbody Bag\n\n Talia Ergas/Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n The quilted leather camera crossbody bag is such a good everyday staple that's easy to dress up or down. At 6 x 8.5 x 3 inches, it's more spacious than it looks, and I can easily fit my large wallet, sunglasses, phone, keys, and even a purse-shaped water bottle inside. In terms of appearance, it's comparable to the ultra-popular Saint Laurent Lou quilted camera bag, but of course, it comes at a very small fraction of the price. For 100% top-grain Italian leather, the price tag is unbeatable.  — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Water Repellent Suede Clog Mule\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I've seen dupes of those suede cork clogs (you know the ones) at Target, but Quince's are a better upgrade because they're made with genuine suede. These mules have a cork midsole like the real deal, but the insole is much more forgiving because it has cushioned arch support.\n\nThey've become my go-to house shoes because they're sturdy, flexible, and have a nice laid-back, West Coast look when I wear them with jeans. I wear mine almost exclusively indoors because the suede isn't super structured, but the comfortable footbed makes them worth it. I'm a size US 8 and found they run a bit small, so I recommend sizing up if you're even slightly between sizes. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Italian Leather & Eco Knit Heeled Mule\n\n Samantha Crozier/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n These knit mules are featured in our most comfortable heels guide. According to style editor Samantha Crozier, they take almost no break-in time and the elastic upper is suitable for those with bunions or irregularly shaped feet. However, we don't recommend them for narrow feet because they'll probably slip off.\n\n\"The silhouette of Quince's Eco Knit Heeled Mule is strikingly similar to Everlane's Day Glove Mule in ReKnit , but Quince's is a quarter of an inch higher and about half as expensive (when the Everlane shoe is not on sale)I was a little worried that these would make a clomp-clomp sound (like a few people have reported with the Everlane Day Glove Mules), but I was pleasantly surprised that the knit had enough tension in it that the shoe stayed tight to my foot.These are super walkable and slightly more casual than a toe strap sandal or a slingback. They're a great option for everyday workwear —elevating jeans while still looking sharp enough to pair with a blazer.\" — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Italian Leather Horsebit Loafer Mule\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n I wanted to like these Gucci lookalikes, but I was immediately unimpressed with their construction. The leather felt too thin and loosely structured, and the positioning of the footbeds felt so off that I checked to see I hadn't put them on the opposite feet by accident. \n\nI've gathered from this example that even though Quince's Italian leather is soft and flexible, it doesn't work for slip-on mules where you need a firm, thicker leather to hold its shape. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n Quince Diamond Engagement Ring\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n This gold ring has a four prong setting and features an emerald cut lab-grown colorless 3.05 carat diamond. It's a VS1 diamond, meaning it has minor internal defects (called \"inclusions\"), but these are invisible to the naked eye.Overall, I'd say Quince diamond engagement rings are most worth it for people who like a modestly-sized lab-grown diamond with a simple band. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider ReviewsRead more in our full Quince Diamond Engagement Ring review.\n\n Quince Silver Threader Drop Earrings\n\n Gabrielle Chase/Business Insider \n\n Check price at Quince\n\n Even though these are really subtle and small, the Silver Threader Drop Earrings are a best-seller from Quince's jewelry collection. I gather it's because the style is so easy to put on and forget about — they're extremely lightweight, and made with 925 sterling silver so they won't irritate your skin if you have a nickel allergy. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider ReviewsSee more in our guide to where to buy silver jewelry online.\n\n The bottom line\n\n Overall, we found Quince a budget-friendly source for elevated basics. There are many hits (affordable cashmere, comfy dresses), several misses (crumpled linen, flimsy silk, flatly-colored leather), and even more that fall somewhere in between.Our impression of the brand itself is that it has a lot more to prove when it comes to being consistent, size inclusive, and sustainable. Nevertheless, because its core designs are so classic and simple, Quince makes the cut for what we call luxury-adjacent clothing.",

Sinclair and Nexstar, which own local TV stations, said that they would preempt Kimmel's show. ABC announced that it would suspend Kimmel's show nationwide \"indefinitely.\" Kimmel was reinstated within a week upon an uproar of support from the entertainment industry. Nexstar and Sinclair ended their boycott of the show soon after.Kimmel himself has also frequently hinted that he may be leaving his late-night show behind. In 2024, he told the Los Angeles Times in an interview that his current deal with Disney may be his \"final contract.\"\"I hate to even say it, because everyone's laughing at me now,\" Kimmel told the LA Times. \"Each time I think that, and then it turns out to not be the case.\"Under the new deal, Kimmel's show, which has been on air since 2003, may shape up to be one of the longest-running late-night shows. Kimmel's show has now been running longer than \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" and \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.\"",

Sales of its H20 chips to China during Q3 were \"insignificant,\" CFO Colette Kress said on its latest earnings call.\"While we were disappointed in the current state that prevents us from shipping more competitive data center compute products to China, we are committed to continued engagement with the US and China governments and will continue to advocate for America's ability to compete around the world,\" Kress said during the Q3 earnings call.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang met with Trump last week to discuss export controls on chips.\"I've said repeatedly that we support export control, that we should ensure that American companies have the best and the most and first,\" Huang told reporters last week.Nvidia stock was up roughly 2% after hours.",

The call had been dispatched as \"Priority: Low.\"\"What's your name?\" one of the officers asked, approaching Mangione at the back of the restaurant. \"Uh, Mark,\" Mangione answered, according to sealed police bodycam footage shown in court. He told them he was homeless.He then handed over this New Jersey license — listing his name as \"Mark Rosario.\"\n\n When officers walked into the McDonald's, Mangione wore this mask over his face. Everything changed when the mask came off.\n\n Luigi Mangione was wearing this face mask when the first officers entered a McDonalds in Altoona, Pennsylvania.\n\n Manhattan DA's Office/Business Insider \n\n Mangione was then asked to pull down his blue-and-white paper medical mask, which Altoona patrolman Joseph Detwiler said made Mangioni stand out.\"We don't wear masks,\" Detwiler told the jury. \"We have antibodies.\"When Mangione's mask was lowered, everything changed. \"I knew it was him immediately,\" testified Detwiler. \"I stayed calm.\"Bodycam footage showed the officer whistling along as Jingle Bell Rock played on the McDonald's sound system — to keep Mangione calm as well, as they ran his license, he told the judge.\n\n An arresting officer testified he was concerned Luigi Mangione could be dangerous, in part because he'd seen images like this one.\n\n A still photo from sidewalk surveillance video that was shown at an evidence hearing in the fatal shooting of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson.\n\n Manhattan District Attorney's Office/Business Insider \n\n Detwiler had closely followed the manhunt for Thompson's killer, the veteran patrolman told New York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro from the witness stand.He'd said he'd seen NYPD social media postings publicizing the as-yet-unnamed shooting suspect's face. Elsewhere online, he had seen surveillance footage of the shooting, which was played in court.\"I knew in New York that they hadn't found the firearm,\" Detwiler testified. Safety, he explained, was behind the decision to frisk Mangione and search his backpack before arresting him on the initial Pennsylvania charges of forgery and providing a false ID to law enforcement.\n\n Additional evidence was taken from Mangione at Altoona's police station, including a handwritten to-do list.\n\n Part doodled map, part shopping list, here is a checklist that police found when Luigi Mangione was at the Altoona Police station.\n\n Manhattan DA's Office/Business Insider \n\n Once at the Altoona Police station, a more thorough search of Mangione's backpack, pockets, clothing, and other belongings was conducted. Officers found this folded scrap of lined paper, filled with writing and diagrams in pencil.Part doodled map, part to-do list, it is filled with dates and tasks, only some of which were accomplished. Under \"12/8,\" the words \"Best buy\" had been crossed off, as were mentions of a USB drive, \"digital cam,\" and \"light source.\"\"Hot meal\" and \"water bottles\" were also crossed off.Other items on the list — including \"AAA bats\" and \"survival kit,\" under the date 12/9, the day of his arrest — were not crossed out.\n\n They also recovered a small folding knife and $7,800 in large bills.\n\n Currency taken from Luigi Mangione by Altoona, Pennsylvania police included 77 $100 bills and one $50 bill.\n\n Manhattan District Attorney's Office/Business Insider \n\n At the Altoona police station, cops recovered $7,800 in large bills and currency from Thailand, Japan, and India, totaling $1,620, from Mangioni's backpack. \n\n\"There's a weapon,\" Patrolwoman Christy Wasser is heard saying soon after, in footage showing her continuing to search Mangione's backpack.Given the gun and the at-first-overlooked knife, the decision was made to strip-search Mangione.",

    "fullText": "Contestants fight polar bears and snakes in new AI reality showA murderer, a Navy Seal and a content creator parachute into the jungle for a Hunger Games-style fight to the death — move over I’m a Celeb, virtual reality is taking overTravis Drake, player one, is a former Navy Seal and 100 per cent AI-generatedAlex Farber, Media CorrespondentMonday December 08 2025, 7.50pm, The TimesThe stakes in reality television are about to be raised. The latest series, described by its creators as a cross between The Hunger Games, Traitors and The Truman Show, features six super-fit contestants parachuted into remote locations for a fight to the death and a huge cash prize.In one shocking scene, a contestant toys with another by peppering them with gunshots, while others fend off a venomous snake and a polar bear.“Whoever wins this is never going to be the same,” predicts Eliza Cole, a contestant who has been released from a prison sentence for murder, in a trailer for the show.Eliza Cole, player five, is a murderer in the pursuit of redemptionThe catch is that the entire series has been produced using artificial intelligence.Non Player Combat is the brainchild of Tom Paton, a former horror film director and visual effects producer, who is confident that young audiences are ready for a reality show created entirely using computers.Advertisement“This particular audience is already OK with characters not being real,” Paton, 40, said. “The question is, do you actually care that it’s AI if you’re entertained? That’s all that counts.”He pointed to the millions watching other people play video games on the streaming service Twitch, as well as the success of CGI films such as Avatar, as evidence that 18 to 35-year-olds are happy to become invested in digital characters.Paton’s company, AiMation, has created six characters including Travis Drake, a former Navy Seal, Micah Gray, a wilderness coach, and the guilt-ridden Cole.Micah Gray, player four, is a wilderness coachThe contestants were “trained” using hundreds of pages of detailed back stories with facts about where they went to school, who they fell in love with, their favourite food and what tragedies they have faced.They have human vulnerabilities and are susceptible to disease, wild animals, poison and the need to eat and drink to stay alive. AdvertisementAs well as crafting the characters, AI was also given editorial control of the show. Its decisions resulted in the contestants facing “biblical” weather conditions in remote locations including jungles, deserts and mountains.Madison Cross, player three, is a survival trainer and adventure content creatorThe show is being released weekly on YouTube from Monday after producers distilled four weeks’ worth of footage, created in four days, to four episodes.It cost less than £30,000 to produce, compared with the multimillion-pound budgets required by the likes The Traitors on BBC1 and I’m A Celebrity…Get Me Out Of Here on ITV.AI content has drawn the ire of Hollywood A-listers including Kate Winslet and Guillermo Del Toro, but Paton said that such a stance was effectively elitist.“Someone like Guillermo Del Toro yelling ‘f*** AI’ is not only eye-rolling, it’s gatekeeping,” he said.Advertisement“Media has always diversified. Cinema didn’t kill TV. TV didn’t kill home video. Streaming didn’t kill cinema. Some people still swear vinyl sounds better, but that doesn’t mean Spotify shouldn’t exist.”The first two episodes of the show are available on YouTube and the others will be released on December 15 and 22He said there had been interest from British broadcasters about airing Non Player Combat, as well as wider partnership opportunities.Steven D Wright, a television producer, said the rise of AI reality series was “inevitable”.He noted the way in which audiences had taken computer game characters such as Lara Croft from Tomb Raider to their hearts as they have become more realistic.“We have already had Channel 4’s Dispatches using AI presenters and are becoming so used to fake videos on TikTok and YouTube that it seems impossible to stop,” he said.Advertisement“If you work in TV then it’s a terrible thing, but as a viewer the only question is, are you entertained? We have an innate ability to believe in made-up characters. Cartoon, CGI, AI — it’s all just storytelling.”Non Player Combat’s characters contend with extreme terrain and weather conditions on a remote islandIn September Tilly Norwood, an AI-generated actress, caused controversy after her creator claimed Hollywood agents were interested in signing her up.Eline van der Velden, founder of Particle6, said she was open to Norwood starring in a future series of Non Player Combat.She said: “People are becoming more and more receptive to AI, realising that it is all part of a new creative renaissance that can and will transform entertainment.“Significantly, there is also much greater recognition of the skill, time and effort taken to create something that looks this good.”Related articles‘Cats are notoriously difficult’: How AI killed the Hollywood animal starNovember 03 2025, 5.00pmKeiran Southern, West Coast Editor, USVIDEOI invented the AI actress Tilly Norwood.

Discovery is a big deal — literally.The all-cash offer of $30 per share works out to a valuation of more than $108 billion, or an equity valuation of $78.7 billion, for WBD's entire operation, putting it in the upper echelons of hostile takeover attempts in recent decades.In fairness, the $82.7 billion deal, or $72 billion equity valuation, from streaming giant Netflix is also pretty massive. That was the one WBD's board had agreed on, and it excluded certain pieces of the business.\"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.To get a sense of the biggest hostile takeover deals of the past 30 years, Business Insider asked financial analytics provider Dealogic to pull the numbers.Here are the equity valuations of the 14 largest hostile takeover announcements since 1995, and where the Paramount deal for WBD would fit in.AT&T Broadband LLC by Comcast Corp, 2002 - $32.7 billionComcast launched an unsolicited bid for AT&T Broadband, which was then the largest cable operator in the US. After a few rounds of negotiations and pressure from shareholders, AT&T accepted the offer. The deal gave rise to Comcast's national expansion.Twitter Inc by Elon Musk, 2022 - $41.3 billionThe billionaire CEO of Tesla made an unsolicited offer to buy Twitter after building a large stake. Twitter initially resisted, but eventually accepted the deal. Musk, however, tried to back out of the deal and was met with litigation, before eventually closing the takeover he started. Musk had since then changed the platform's algorithm, its name, and content moderation rules.National Westminster Bank by Royal Bank of Scotland Group, 1999 - $42.6 billionIn what was at the time Europe's largest hostile takeover, RBS and Bank of Scotland fought in a bidding war for NatWest, which ended with RBS's victory through a hostile offer. The deal helped RBS become a global banking giant, but at the cost of taking on excessive debt. RBS collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.Genentech Inc by Roche Holding AG, 2009 - $46.8 billionRoche, which already owned a majority stake in Genentech, launched a hostile bid for full ownership. The biotech company initially resisted the attempt due to undervaluation. After raising the offer, Roche succeeded.Reynolds American Inc by British American Tobacco, 2016 - $49.4 billionBAT made an unsolicited offer to buy the remainder of Reynolds, after already owning a large stake in it. Reynolds negotiated a higher price but ultimately accepted the takeover. The deal created the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company at the time.Anheuser-Busch Companies LLC by InBev SA/NV, 2008 - $50.5 billionBelgium's InBev made a hostile offer for Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of beer brand Budweiser. AB's management and founding family initially resisted being taken over by a foreign company, but shareholders pressured them to accept after InBev raised its bid.Monsanto Co by Bayer AG, 2018 - $57 billionBayer made an unsolicited offer to Monsanto, and the chemical company held out for a higher price before accepting the deal. Unfortunately for Bayer, the German biotech company also inherited lawsuits against Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.Elf Aquitaine SA by TotalFina SA, 2000 - $57.9 billionTotalFina launched a hostile bid for Elf in a dramatic French corporate battle. After nearly a year of fighting and regulatory scrutiny, the companies merged and became one of the world's biggest oil companies. The combined entity was eventually renamed as TotalEnergies.Shire PLC by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd, 2019 - $63.1 billionJapanese company Takeda made a series of unsolicited bids for UK-based Shire. Shire repeatedly rejected the deal until Takeda substantially increased the offer. This is one of the largest acquisitions ever made by a Japanese company, and it gave Takeda a large rare disease drug portfolio.Aventis SA by Sanofi-Synthelabo SA, 2004 - $72.9 billionSanofi's unsolicited takeover was met with strong resistance from Aventis, so much so that the company sought to be acquired by a different pharmaceutical giant, Novartis. Sanofi sweetened the offer, and Aventis eventually accepted it.Warner Bros. Discovery by Paramount Skydance, 2025 (Pending) - $78.7 billionParamount launched its hostile takeover bid after WBD's board bypassed its offers in favor of a deal with Netflix.Warner-Lambert Co by Pfizer Inc, 2000 - $86.6 billionPfizer launched a hostile bid to break apart Warner-Lambert's agreed merger with American Home Products. Warner-Lambert fought back but ultimately conceded. This gave Pfizer full ownership of Lipitor, which holds the record for the highest lifetime sales for a single drug.ABN Amro Holding NV by Royal Bank of Scotland Group, 2007 - $97 billionImmediately before the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays tried to acquire ABN AMRO amicably, but RBS, alongside Fortis and Banco Santander, countered with a hostile, higher bid and won. The acquisition sped up RBS's collapse soon after.SABMiller by Anheuser-Busch InBev, 2016 - $114.4 billionIn a move that consolidated much of the world's beer industry under one entity, AB InBev launched a hostile offer for SABMiller, eventually raising the bid to satisfy resistant shareholders.UK company Vodafone AirTouch launched a hostile bid for German company Mannesmann, which had rapidly become one of Europe's most valuable telecom companies. Mannesmann fiercely resisted, framing the bid as an attack on German industrial values and national pride. The record-setting battle lasted three months, ending with Vodafone winning by raising the bid.",

As of writing, all dates still have limited availability for original tickets, and can still be purchased on Ticketmaster.Tickets are also available for purchase from verified resale vendor sites such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Many popular tour stops, such as Las Vegas, have limited remaining seating options; in such cases, you may find more ideal options on resale sites instead.How much are Luke Combs tickets?With shows still having yet to sell out, ticket prices between the original and resale options are somewhat similar, with resale options leaning slightly more affordable for certain dates. Original standard ticket prices vary depending on the venue and location, but currently tend to fall within the average range of $100 to just over $300. Many locations even offer pit options under $300 (Knoxville and South Bend, for example), which is very reasonable compared to other artists whose pit tickets can easily exceed $1,000.As of writing, for the resale option, Vivid Seats has prices ever so slightly below those of StubHub, with the most affordable options ranging from $71 for the May 2 tour stop in Knoxville to $176 for the May 30 tour stop in Montreal. StubHub ranges from $79 for the same Knoxville show to $244 for the Green Bay performance on May 16. The biggest difference right now is that Vivid Seats has fewer international location options, which is somewhat common for the site in general.Luke Combs has a guest appearance at Alan Jackson’s event in Nashville on June 27, and prices for this are considerably higher than his own headlining tour’s stops. This is due to the event being large, with several artists performing.There are no VIP packages for The My Kind Of Saturday Night tour available for purchase on Ticketmaster.Who is opening for Luke Combs’ tour?Several artists have been confirmed to join Luke Combs on his upcoming 2026 world tour. For North American shows, Dierks Bentley, Ty Myers, The Castellows, and Thelma & James have been tapped as supporting artists. Europe will continue to see Ty Myers and the Castellows perform, with The Script also joining them for shows in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Ireland. The Teskey Brothers have been announced as an opening act for the Edinburgh show, and Thomas Rhett will also be supporting the London concert.Will there be international tour dates?The My Kinda Saturday Night tour has 10 international dates currently scheduled. The tour will head to Sweden in July, followed by shows in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and will conclude in the UK with five performances in Edinburgh and London.Who is Luke Combs?Luke Combs is an American country singer from North Carolina who first emerged on the scene in 2014 with his debut EP, “The Way She Rides”.

Discovery.On Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.In response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.Trump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"But he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"Trump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.Business Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.Paramount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",

Log in.\n\n Kalshi's CEO said rivalry with Polymarket drives both companies to push harder.\n He likened the competition to famous sports rivalries, like Tom Brady and Eli Manning.\n Kalshi recently announced major media partnerships and a $1 billion funding round.\n\n Kalshi's CEO says his company's rivalry with Polymarket has parallels to two sets of sporting legends.In an episode of the \"20VC\" podcast released on Monday, Tarek Mansour explained how prediction market rival Polymarket has encouraged his company to work harder.\"What I'm learning over time is that an industry truly becomes an industry when there's a rivalry, because that rivalry will push you beyond the limits of what you thought you could get to,\" Mansour said.He compared the companies to National Football League quarterbacks Tom Brady and Eli Manning.\"When Tom Brady kind of reflected on that back in the day, he's like, 'You know, we were like the most ferocious on the field, and we fought each other,'\" Mansour said. \"But then over time, he became grateful for that because he realized that without Manning being in there and vice versa, he would have never achieved what he achieved.\"\"I think that's happening in prediction markets,\" he added.Kalshi, founded in 2018, lets users bet on the outcome of events such as elections, sports matches, and economic indicators. Last week, it announced partnerships with media giants CNN and CNBC, and said that it raised $1 billion at a valuation of $11 billion.Polymarket, its blockchain-enabled competitor, was founded in 2020 and offers similar services. It was last valued at $13.5 billion in November, per PitchBook.The popularity of prediction platforms has exploded since a legal victory for Kalshi in the US last fall. Now, users can bet on questions ranging from the popularity of Labubu dolls to Elon Musk's net worth.Last year, Mansour said in an interview that his employees asked social media influencers to promote memes about an FBI raid on the home of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan. On Monday's podcast, Mansour called the move a \"mistake\" and said he \"made clear to the team: 'Don't ever do this again.'\"Mansour also compared the two companies to soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and said that it was not a coincidence that the two \"greatest\" players exist in the same era.\"Without Polymarket, we wouldn't have pushed our marketing and pushed our product as hard,\" he said. \"That sort of infighting is going to push both of us to scale this industry and reach heights that we honestly wouldn't have been able to otherwise, which long-term is actually net positive for the customer.\"Polymarket did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about Mansour's comparisons.",

While AI will not \"dramatically reduce\" jobs in the next year, \"it will eliminate jobs,\" Dimon said.\"It doesn't mean people won't have other jobs,\" he said, adding that workers should lean into critical thinking, communication, and emotional intelligence.The real danger, he said, is that AI adoption could outpace society's ability to train workers.\"If it does happen too fast for society, which is possible, we can't assimilate all those people that quickly,\" Dimon said.Government, companies, and society \"should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don't damage a lot of people,\" he added.Dimon has been optimistic about the long-term potential of AI. Last month, he said AI would shrink the workweek.\"My guess is the developed world will be working three and a half days a week in 20, 30, 40 years,\" Dimon said in November at the America Business Forum in Miami.\"You're going to have agents that do research for you every time you wake up in the morning,\" he added.Dimon hasn't downplayed the risks, either. At a Fortune-hosted conference last month, he warned that job elimination is inevitable. \"People should stop sticking their heads in the sand,\" he said.Big bank CEOs on AI disruptionOther big bank CEOs have also said that AI has long-term benefits, but they highlighted the disruption ahead.Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in October that AI will lead to shifting job functions, but \"at the end of the day, we have an incredibly flexible, nimble economy.\"\"I'm excited about it,\" he said, adding that he sees \"lots of opportunities for our business.\"The CEO of Wells Fargo, Charles Scharf, echoed that view. He told Reuters last month that \"the opportunities that exist in AI are very significant.\"\"Anyone who sits here today and says that they don't think they'll have less head count because of AI either doesn't know what they're talking about or is just not being totally honest about it,\" he said.",

    "description": "When evaluating a new product launch, companies typically weigh factors like price and promotion. New research suggests adding another element: people. A study of new product rollouts at a major Colombian retailer found that managerial quality strongly influences a new product’s success. Stores led by high-performing managers saw new product revenue jump nearly 20% within six months and expanded distribution by 31% in under a year. This is because superior managers excel at inventory forecasting and ensuring popular new items stay in stock.",

    "description": "Influencer marketing has grown into a $24 billion industry, but trust in influencers is declining as consumers increasingly perceive many as inauthentic. Authenticity is not a fixed trait; it is co-created through interactions among influencers, brands, followers, and agencies, and hinges on five key dimensions: expertise, connectedness, integrity, originality, and transparency. When these dimensions are misaligned—such as when brands prioritize reach over relevance or influencers conceal financial motives—authenticity breaks down and trust erodes. However, when brands and influencers intentionally manage these tensions, influencer marketing can move beyond transactional exchanges to foster genuine, transformational relationships, making authenticity a vital currency in today’s creator economy.",

Photograph: Dado Ruvić/ReutersSam Altman issues ‘code red’ at OpenAI as ChatGPT contends with rivalsChief executive tells staff it is ‘critical time’ for chatbot as it faces intense competition from Google’s new Gemini 3Sam Altman has declared a “code red” at OpenAI to improve ChatGPT as the chatbot faces intense competition from rivals.According to a report by tech news site the Information, the chief executive of the San Francisco-based startup told staff in an internal memo: “We are at a critical time for ChatGPT.”OpenAI has been rattled by the success of Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3, and is devoting more internal resources to improving ChatGPT.Last month, Altman told employees that the launch of Gemini 3, which has outperformed rivals on various benchmarks, could create “temporary economic headwinds” for the company. He added: “I expect the vibes out there to be rough for a bit.”OpenAI’s flagship product has 800 million weekly users but Google is also highly profitable due to its search business and has substantial data and financial resources to throw at its AI tools.Sam Altman. Photograph: José Luis Magaña/APMarc Benioff, the chief executive of the $220bn (£166bn) software group Salesforce, wrote last month that he had switched allegiance to Gemini 3 and was “not going back” after trying Google’s latest AI release.“I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane – reasoning, speed, images, video … everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again,” he wrote on X.OpenAI is also delaying a foray into putting advertising in ChatGPT as it focuses on improving the chatbot, which celebrated its third birthday last month.The head of ChatGPT, Nick Turley, marked the anniversary with a post on X pledging to break new ground with the product.He wrote: “Our focus now is to keep making ChatGPT more capable, continue growing, and expand access around the world – while making it even more intuitive and personal. Thanks for an incredible three years. Lots more to do!”Despite lacking the cash flow support enjoyed by rivals Google, Meta and Amazon, which is a big funder of competitor Anthropic, OpenAI has received substantial funding from the likes of the SoftBank investment group and Microsoft. In its latest valuation, OpenAI reached $500bn, up from $157bn last October.OpenAI is loss-making and expects to end the year with annual revenues of more than $20bn, which Altman expects will grow to “hundreds of billion[s]” by 2030. The startup is committed to steep revenue growth after pledging to spend $1.4tn on datacentre costs to train and operate its AI systems over the next eight years.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotion“Based on the trends we are seeing of how people are using AI and how much of it they would like to use, we believe the risk of OpenAI of not having enough computing power is more significant and more likely than the risk of having too much,” said Altman last month.Apple has also responded to increasingly intense competitive pressures in the sector by naming a new vice-president of AI. Amar Subramanya, a Microsoft executive, will replace John Giannandrea.Apple has been slow to add AI features to its products in comparison with rivals such as Samsung, which have been quicker to refresh their devices with AI features.Subramanya is joining Apple from Microsoft, where he most recently served as corporate vice-president of AI. Previously, Subramanya spent 16 years at Google, where his roles included the head of engineering for the Gemini assistant.Earlier this year, Apple said AI improvements to its voice assistant Siri would be delayed until 2026.Explore more on these topicsChatGPTOpenAIChatbotsGoogleArtificial intelligence (AI)Sam AltmanTechnology sectornewsShareReuse this content",

    "title": "Two Productivity Techniques That Can Help You Do More (by Actually Doing Less)",
    "description": "Let's make your to-dos a little easier, shall we?",
    "fullText": "Not every productivity method works for every person. That's why there are so many out there, and it's also why you need to spend time figuring out which ones might work for you, even if you have to alter or adapt them a little bit. When you're facing down an unusually big or overwhelming task, the traditional methods that you usually rely on may not be helpful. Why not try a one-two punch, combining two I like a lot to make it easier?The \"one bite\" techniqueFirst, let's try the one-bite technique. This takes a little pre-planning, but can help you out when a task feels daunting. Grab a piece of paper (or use a digital document) and write down your task. Let's say it's leading a quarterly meeting at work. Next, break it down into the smaller tasks that make it up, which could be coordinating the attendees, setting an agenda, making sure the tech and meeting space are order, and keeping track of what is said during the meeting.From there, keep breaking it all down. Coordinating attendees means not only sending out calendar invites, but determining who should get one and staying on top of the lists of who accepted and declined, as well as sending out or scheduling meeting reminders for everyone. Determining the agenda means checking in with presenters and managers on what they're able to present as well as simply writing down a list of topics to go over and allotting the right amount of time to each. Checking on the tech and meeting space mean coordinating with IT, renting the meeting room, checking that your digital meeting space subscription is paid up, and ensuring you'll have enough seats for all attendees. Keeping track of what is said involves designating a note-taker, making sure the AI transcription service is paid for and functioning, setting up a recording system, and creating a timeline and work flow to make sure minutes are distributed to necessary parties in a timely, efficient way when the meeting ends. \n\n You May Also Like\n\nObviously, when you take on the responsibility of setting up a meeting, you know these are all the things you'll need to do, but if you look at the task as one big thing—\"run the meeting\"—instead of consciously breaking it down into smaller duties, you're more likely to get overwhelmed. This is true for everything, from planning a vacation to cleaning the house. Training yourself to break tasks down into smaller \"bites\" instead of just launching into work on the larger product will not only help you keep everything running smoothly, but will motivate you, too: As you see smaller tasks getting done, you'll feel accomplished and prepared to keep going. This is similar to the \"one more\" trick, which asks you to consider whether you can do \"one more\" thing every time you mark off a small accomplishment. I use \"one more\" when I'm cleaning now that I have consistently failed for years to follow a stricter cleaning schedule—and it works fabulously. Acquainting yourself with the various ways tasks can be broken down and approached can help you in your personal, professional, academic, and social lives. Below is another way you can do that if you're focusing on \"bites\" and need a touch of structure for your next steps.The \"reverse Pomodoro\" techniqueBreaking down the \"bites\" of your task isn't enough. You do have to actually complete the bites. When there's a lot to do, it can be hard to make yourself do it or know where to start. You have to start by determining the order in which you'll tackle your bites. There are a few easy ways to do this with the easiest being the ABCDE method (where you assign subjective grades to each duty quickly, then start working), and a more complex, but objective, option being the Eisenhower matrix. Pick one and just get it done because you have to get started on the bites.\n\n What do you think so far?\n\nIf you were using a traditional productivity technique, like the Pomodoro method, you'd start off by working for 25 minutes straight and then taking a five-minute break. That can be daunting, though. Frankly, 25 minutes is a lot of time when you're stressed, even if you've figured out a loose gameplan with one of the prioritization techniques above. Instead, try the \"reverse Pomodoro\" method, which is just like its namesake, except switched around. Instead of working for 25 minutes and getting a tiny break, you work for five, then get a big break. It might seem counterproductive since working for five minutes and relaxing for 20 or 25 means you have a lot of downtime, but it's helpful if you're truly having a hard time getting into the flow of working. People who've tried this method praise it for helping them take the anxiety out of working on a big project because even though there's a lot of chilling out, work is getting done in those five minutes. Eventually, once you have a few tasks completed, you'll be feeling better about the project overall. Don't be surprised if you suddenly feel like you can slog it out for longer than five minutes at a time and slowly move into a more traditional Pomodoro framework to finish up the task. To be honest with you, it's a bit of a mental trick and is similar to the \"one more\" rule mentioned above. Whenever I tell myself I'll just do one thing, then chill, I always end up doing much more just because I feel more accomplished after the first few minutes. If you have to bamboozle your brain a little, so be it.You can reap maximum benefits here by first breaking down your task into those small bites, then completing one bite per reverse-Pomodoro work slot. It's five minutes to email the meeting invitation, then a break. Five minutes to have IT check out the tech connections in the meeting room, then a break. Five minutes to draw up a schedule and pass it around, then a break. It's not cheating to focus on your downtime, especially if you're not being productive enough when you try to work for 25 minutes straight. In fact, breaks and downtime are essential to productivity overall. It's better to get something done than nothing and once you start racking up those somethings, you'll feel motivated to sprint to the finish line.",

    "title": "Use the 'MIT Method' to Keep Your Big-Picture Goals in Mind During Everyday Tasks",
    "description": "Don't prioritize your tasks by what will take the most time—try choosing what will have the biggest impact.",
    "fullText": "So many productivity methods ask you to prioritize your daily tasks by considering how much time or effort they'll require, then tackling the resource-heavy ones first. For some people, that's a solid strategy, since you can definitely get some motivation from getting your toughest, most demanding responsibilities out of the way. There's even a weird name for doing that: \"Eating the frog.\" But you can also find motivation in working toward a bigger goal, so what if you prioritized your tasks based on importance and impact, no matter how big or small they are? That's what the Most Important Task (MIT) method involves: rather than thinking of specific tasks and how long they'll take, the MIT method asks you to look more broadly at the overall goal you're trying to accomplish. Reframing your approach to productivity by focusing on your goal instead can motivate you to get more done and achieve better results.How to use the MIT methodFirst, you'll need to nail down your goals. You can set SMART goals or combine the MIT method with the Results Planning Method (RPM), which asks you to consider your purpose when planning your day. Take some time to write down your goals—the big ones, the ones that all your daily tasks are ostensibly supposed to move you toward. Think of weekly goals, monthly goals, and annual goals, as well as ongoing, long-term ones. Write these down or just keep them in mind, but always think about the broader, bigger picture. An easy example is school: You're not just studying so you can pass the test, but because your overall goal is to graduate, to do so with a solid GPA, and to get a quality job offer. Taking time to reaffirm that broader goal reframes how you view studying for one boring old test.\n\n You May Also Like\n\nEvery morning, make a list of two or three Most Important Tasks for the day. These are critical tasks that will have an impact on your goals, but they don't have to be huge or resource-draining. If answering emails from a potential client will move you toward a monthly sales goal, that is more of an MIT goal than building a presentation for your boss, even though creating the presentation seems like the more demanding, large-scale project. Consider the results of your tasks and prioritize those that have fast or meaningful ones. You want to focus on the two or three tasks that will actually make a difference in moving you toward your goal. \n\n What do you think so far?\n\nTake care of those two or three tasks first, then handle other, less important tasks from your to-do list for the rest of the day. You can use a scheduling technique like the 1-3-5 list or the pickle jar method to figure out which those are and how much time and energy you'll have for them. When using the MIT technique, you should also use a productivity journal to write down your daily to-dos in the morning and reflections on how it all went at night. If you're not familiar, learn how to conduct an after-action review so you have some structure to follow while reflecting and you can efficiently build on whatever takeaways you find. That nighttime reflection is key: You need to be able to identify and see how taking on those critical tasks impacts your progress toward your goal, plus what you did well and what you could do better as you keep striving. That will keep you motivated and moving forward.",

    "description": "Benign add-ons can be weaponized with malicious updates after gaining user trust.",
    "fullText": "Malicious extensions do occasionally find their way into the Chrome Web Store (and similar libraries in other browsers) by posing as legitimate add-ons. They are particularly difficult to catch when they are benign to begin with, only morphing into malware after gaining user trust. That's what happened with a number of extensions on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge: researchers at Koi Security identified add-ons across both browsers that operated legitimately for several years before receiving malicious updates that allow hackers to surveil users and collect and exfiltrate sensitive data. The scheme, known as ShadyPanda, reached four million downloads and is still active on Edge. Threat actors ran a similar campaign targeting Firefox earlier this year: They gained approval for benign extensions mimicking popular crypto wallets, accumulated downloads and positive reviews, and then injected the add-ons with malicious code capable of logging form field inputs, which they used to access and steal crypto assets. \n\n You May Also Like\n\nBrowser extensions can turn badAs Koi Security outlines, ShadyPanda started out as an affiliate scam, with 145 extensions masquerading as wallpaper and productivity apps across the two browsers. The initial phase injected affiliate tracking codes and paid commissions with clicks to eBay, Amazon, and Booking.com and then evolved to hijack and manipulate search results before launching the five extensions in 2018 that would later be converted to malware. Those add-ons were marked as Featured and Verified in Chrome—one, a cache cleaner known as Clean Master, accrued a 4.8 rating from thousands of reviews. The extensions were updated in 2024 to run malware that could check hourly for new instructions and maintain full browser access, feeding information to ShadyPanda's servers. (These have since been removed from Chrome.) Hackers launched an additional five extensions, including WeTab, to Edge in 2023. Two are comprehensive spyware, and all were still active as of Koi's report. \n\n What do you think so far?\n\nHow to find malicious extensions in Chrome and EdgeUnfortunately, malicious extensions are usually pretending to be something else, so a quick visual check of your installed extensions may not reveal a problem. In this case, Koi Security has a list of the extension IDs associated with the ShadyPanda campaign, and you'll have to search for them one by one. In Chrome, type chrome://extensions/ into your address bar and hit Enter. Toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner to reveal the IDs for installed extensions. From here, you can copy and paste each ID into the search bar (Ctrl+F on your PC or Cmd+F on your Mac). If there are no results, your browser is safe. If you do find a malicious add-on, click the Remove button. In Edge, follow the same process from edge://extensions/. While this campaign shows that extensions can be weaponized long after they've been installed, you should still follow best practices for vetting browser add-ons just as you would apps for your device. Check the name carefully, as fraudulent extensions often have names that are nearly identical to trustworthy ones. Review the description for any red flags, such as misspellings and unrelated images. If you see a lot of positive reviews in a short amount of time on a new extension, or if they seem to be reviewing something else entirely, proceed with caution. You can also do additional research, such as a search on Google or Reddit, to see if the extension is legit.",

    "fullText": "After initial reporting from The Wrap revealed that Netflix had won the bidding war for Warner Bros., the streamer stepped in on Friday to confirm that it has a deal with the Warner Bros. board to acquire the home of HBO and HBO Max, DC Comics, and Bugs Bunny for $82.7 billion. The acquisition would put an end to merger attempts from the likes of Paramount and Comcast, but it's also far from a done deal.According to Netflix, its acquisition of Warner Bros. will need to wait until at least Q3 2026, to allow room for the previously announced Warner Bros. and Discovery split to go through, as Netflix does not plan to buy the Discovery part of the business (including its cable channels). Additionally, the deal will need to go through regulatory approval. Given these roadblocks, the companies expect \"to close in 12–18 months.\"The news of the acquisition follows Warner Bros.' announcement in October that it was open to a sale, at least partially motivated by its split with Discovery.\n\n You May Also Like\n\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. The Wrap reported that Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. includes a $5 billion breakup fee in case regulators block the deal, pointing to some anxiety from both companies. To that end, CNBC reported that \"a senior [Trump] administration official\" has said that the government is looking at the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" and The New York Post and the Wall Street Journal both reported that Paramount (which recently completed its own merger with Skydance Entertainment, led by Trump ally David Ellison) is currently warning the administration away from allowing the deal. To that end, the BBC reported over the weekend that Trump said the merger \"could be a problem.\"Paramount is also not done bidding, it seems. The company announced a $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid this morning, bypassing the board and offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery shares from shareholders at a premium. Notably, if accepted, the deal would include the whole of Warner Bros. Discovery, despite the upcoming split, which would also give Paramount access to cable networks like CNN and TBS. In its announcement, Paramount called out the Netflix deal as facing a \"challenging regulatory approval process,\" implying that it would better be able to negotiate with the administration.How regulators will respond to the purchase remains to be seen, but if the deal does go through, it will mark a major shift for both Hollywood and consumers. Netflix hasn't laid out complete plans for how the merger would affects its customers, but in its press release, it has offered a few hints. Should a combined Netflix and Warner Bros. come to pass, here's how you can expect it to affect you.HBO Max probably isn't going awaySince Netflix's primary business is as a streaming app, the most obvious result of a Warner Bros. acquisition would probably be the shuttering of HBO Max, and the inclusion of its content into Netflix proper. However, it seems like we're more likely to get a Disney+/Hulu situation, with the company running both services simultaneously. In its post announcing the merger, Netflix said it will \"maintain Warner Bros.' current operations,\" and that HBO and HBO Max would be viewed as a \"compelling, complementary offering\" for its customers.Whether that means Netflix subscribers will get complementary HBO subscriptions, or if they will simply be able to add HBO onto their plans as complemental \"content,\" is unclear, although I would expect the latter interpretation to be the correct one. After all, Disney charges an additional fee for users who also want to There would be little reason for Netflix to not follow suit.This is backed up by another line further into the press release which states that, \"[b]y adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.\" That implies HBO is something you'll add to an existing subscription, rather than content that will just become part of a base Netflix subscription, with the company saying the acquisition \"also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers.\"Some Warner Bros. shows might come to NetflixNetflix already offers a small smattering of shows originally developed for either HBO or HBO Max, such as Sex and the City and Scavenger's Reign. This is due to pre-existing content sharing agreements, but it's possible Netflix may continue to offer some HBO content to its existing subscribers for free, even if it continues to operate HBO as a separate entity.\n\n What do you think so far?\n\nFor instance, Netflix says in the merger announcement that \"shows and movies such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe will join Netflix's extensive portfolio.\" While this is likely simply acknowledging acquired IP, I wouldn't be surprised to see some select shows hit Netflix from time to time, either to prop up sparse release schedules or to promote HBO subscriptions/add-ons.Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters also says in the release that, \"[w]ith our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they [Warner Bros.] create.\" He adds this would be an opportunity to attract, \"more fans to our best-in-class streaming service.\"Expect Netflix to ramp up U.S. productionWhile Netflix is most known to consumers as an app, its large selection of original content also means that it operates as a production studio. Netflix says that it will use the acquisition of Warner Bros. production side to \"enhance Netflix's studio capabilities, allowing the Company to significantly expand U.S. production.\"This means that viewers might expect to see more original Netflix content in the future, specifically more American-made shows in the vein of Stranger Things, alongside localized foreign programming like Squid Game.Gamers need to pay attention tooAlongside its movie and TV businesses, Netflix will also be acquiring Warner Bros. Games, a spokesperson confirmed to Game Developer. That means the company will now be responsible for publishing both licensed works, such as the Batman Arkham series, as well as gaming originals, like the Mortal Kombat series. Little is known about how Netflix will handle suddenly being in charge of these longstanding AAA series, but given the company's recent gaming ambitions and its promise to continue Warner Bros. operations as usual, it's likely these titles will continue in some capacity.Netflix will also publish DC ComicsIn addition to suddenly stepping into big-budget, AAA gaming, Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. also means it's getting control of DC Comics' print business alongside its film and TV businesses, as the publisher is wholly owned by Warner Bros. That's another big step for the company, although given that DC's print business serves largely as the foundation of lucrative IP such as Superman and Batman, it's likely Netflix will do its best to keep operations there as smooth as possible. However, readers might expect some Netflix and DC synergy, similar to when Marvel started publishing new Star Wars comics shortly after Disney acquired Lucasfilm. Batman visiting the Upside-Down from Stranger Things might be more likely than you'd think.Don't expect Warner Bros. movies to go straight to streamingFinally, while Netflix's past movie releases have often relied on direct-to-streaming drops complemented by just enough of a theatrical presence to qualify for awards, Netflix said in its release that it plans to continue distributing Warner Bros. produced movies as usual, \"including theatrical releases for films,\" but that the exclusive theatrical window may shrink. In other words, The Batman 2 probably isn't going to get the Knives Out or KPop Demon Hunters treatment, but theater exclusivity for Warner Bros. movies might not be as long going forward.",

    "description": "An  illustrated guide to the iconic sci-fi saga’s history, lore, and evolution.",
    "fullText": "For more than half a century, audiences have been captivated by the Planet of the Apes—a sprawling sci-fi epic that spans at least three timelines, 3,000 years of history, and a franchise that includes 10 feature films, two TV series, three video games, and dozens of comics and novels. Whether you're a long-time fan trying to make sense of the lore or a newcomer wondering how a talking chimpanzee led to a post-apocalyptic planet dominated by primates, I’ve laid out the Planet of the Apes series by release order, chronological continuity, critical and commercial reception, the technological milestones of ape civilizations, and more. This is your illustrated guide to the rise (and fall... and rise again, and fall, etc.) of the Planet of the Apes.What is the Planet of the Apes?Planet of the Apes is one of the strangest, most ambitious, and longest-running film franchises in cinema history. Films in the series vary wildly in quality, ambition, competence, and style, but all Apes movies, from the 1968 original to 2024’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, share a narrative focus: a world-shaking conflict between humans and intelligent apes.\n\n You May Also Like\n\nEvery Planet of the Apes movie, in chronological order \n\nThe original saga (1968–1973)Planet of the Apes (1968): Based on Pierre Boulle’s 1963 sci-fi novel La Planète des Singes, 1968’s Planet of the Apes tells the story of astronaut George Taylor, who crash lands on what he thinks is a distant planet where apes are intelligent and in charge, and the people are dumb slaves.Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970): While star Charlton Heston appears in the film briefly, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is really the story of Brent, an astronaut who’s been sent to rescue Taylor. Escape from the Planet of the Apes (1971): You’d think the annihilation of the entire planet would end the Planet of the Apes series, but no: In Escape, Cornelius, Zira, and Dr. Milo manage to flee the planet on Taylor’s ship before the doomsday bomb explodes; the trio time-travel to 1973.Conquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972): The last two old-school Planet of the Apes movies had lower budgets than their predecessors, and it definitely shows. Lore-wise, Conquest presents a divergent narrative path to explain the development of ape intelligence and other events. Battle for the Planet of the Apes (1973): In the years since the Ape rebellion in Conquest, a nuclear war has killed most humans; humans and ape relations are good enough, but the fragile detente is broken by human-hating gorilla Aldo.  The Burton reboot (2001)Planet of the Apes (2001): After a nearly 30-year hiatus, 2001’s Apes is a thematically and tonally uneven summer blockbuster featuring a by-the-numbers plot, mid-tier action, and an ending that confuses everyone. (The makeup and production design are top-notch, though.) The modern quadrilogy (2011–2024)Rise of the Planet of the Apes (2011): This movie blows the dust off the hoary old apes and breathes fresh creative life into a moribund franchise; Rise is a film packed with both action and dignity. Dawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014): Dawn takes place about a decade after the events of the last movie, and apes are definitely on the come-up: It features the most nuanced (and most depressing) take on the conflict between species.War for the Planet of the Apes (2017): If the message of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is “war is inevitable…,” the message of War for the Planet of the Apes is “..and war is hell.” It's a grim movie. Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024): Kingdom explores an ape-dominated world where the few humans left are brainless scavengers (or so it seems). It doesn’t break new ground the way Rise did, but Kingdom opens the way for more Planet of the Apes sequels in the future. \n\nGeographic location of each Planet of the Apes movieOver more than five decades of films, Planet of the Apes has taken audiences from the shattered ruins of New York City to the tranquil redwood forests of Northern California, and even to entirely different worlds (maybe). This map tracks the primary settings of each movie, showing how the saga’s conflicts play out across Earth. \n\nWho traveled where in time?From astronauts overshooting the present by millennia, to apes hurtling back to the 20th century’s hippy era, time travel is integral to the Planet of the Apes, so lets take a look at the franchise’s major temporal tourists, charting when they left, when they arrived, and just how far they jumped.\n\nThe complicated chronology of the Planet of the ApesIf you’re considering a watch order for the Planet of the Apes, \"in order by chronology\" is the worst option—the Apes timeline is simply all over the place. While there are a few moments in the modern quadrilogy (2011–2024) that suggest the films are prequels to the original pentalogy (1968–1973), these are ultimately fan-service Easter eggs; the two series just don’t connect unless you get very creative with time-travel loops and offscreen assumptions. Hell, the first five films don’t connect with themselves unless you get creative with time-travel. So, I got creative with time travel to break down the major historical milestones in the Planet of the Apes Universe, across three timelines. (Four, if you count the self-contained 2001 Planet.) Here are the Planet of the Apes movies listed in order of the year that each one takes place:\n\nCritical reception of Planet of the Apes moviesCritics have a love-hate relationship with Planet of the Apes movies. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the “best” Apes movie is War for the Planet of the Apes, which was praised by 94% of critics. The “worst” is Battle for the Planet of the Apes, with only 33% positivity. That’s a big spread!\n\nHow much money did each Planet of the Apes movie make? Critical acceptance is great; but in cynical Hollywood terms, the only measure of a good movie is how much money it makes. By that metric, the “best” Apes movie is the 2001 reboot, Planet of the Apes. Despite mixed review, the movie made $328,049,530.32 in domestic ticket sales (adjusted for inflation), which is even more than the original and the 2014 blockbuster Dawn of the Planet of the Apes. \n\n What do you think so far?\n\nA who’s-who of ape leadership Any society is defined by its leaders, including ape society, so here is a breakdown of the doctors, generals, and tribal chiefs who have ruled the apes over the last 50 years.  \n\nDr. Zaius (Planet of the Apes, Beneath the Planet of the Apes): An orangutan Minister of Science and Defender of the Faith who balances political control with the fear of humanity’s return. General Ursus (Beneath the Planet of the Apes): This violent gorilla warlord never encountered a problem he couldn’t meet with violence. Dr. Zira (Escape from the Planet of the Apes, 1970): A compassionate and sharp-witted chimpanzee thrust into the role of cultural ambassador between societies on the verge of war, Dr. Zira is the defacto leader of a small band of ape time-travelers.Caesar (Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Battle for the Planet of the Apes): The original Caesar is a fiery revolutionary who transforms ape resentment into a successful uprising against humanity.General Thade (Planet of the Apes, 2001): A sadistic and cunning chimpanzee general obsessed with wiping out humanity.Caesar (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, War for the Planet of the Apes): A hyper-intelligent chimp raised by humans, Caesar’s combination of tactical brilliance, political savvy, raw charisma, and genuine compassion for both apes and humans make him the best overall ape leader.Koba (2014, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes): A bitter, scarred veteran of human torture and hero of the ape revolution, Koba has been through some shit.  Proximus Caesar (Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes): An iron-fisted militarist who twists the past to justify authoritarian rule, Proximus Caesar rules through fear and historical revisionism.Ape technological and intellectual milestones by movieAcross the Planet of the Apes films, the ever-shifting balance of power between apes and humans often comes down to brains as much as brawn. Each installment shows apes using technologies, social systems, and tactics that they’ve either developed or borrowed from humans. From crude tools and simple rules to heavy artillery and complex political structures, these milestones mark the evolving capabilities of ape society over the decades (and timelines) of the franchise. Here's a breakdown of the technological highlights of ape society in each movie.\n\nApe-adjacent TV shows, video games, comic books and moviesIf ten feature films isn't enough Apes for you, there's plenty more material out there. The Ape-verse began with a novel, and has grown to include a live-action TV series, a cartoon series, three video games, and dozens of novelizations and comic books.",

    "title": "Samsung's One UI 8.5 Beta Is Now Officially Available",
    "description": "You can sign up for the beta today.",
    "fullText": "If you're getting bored with your Galaxy phone, there are changes on the horizon. Samsung announced One UI 8.5 on Monday, Dec. 8, the latest update for Galaxy devices. At present, this new update is only out in beta, but select Galaxy users can try it out right now. Here's what's new, according to Samsung. Proactive Quick ShareWith One UI 8.5, Quick Share can automatically identify people in photos. While that sounds a bit creepy, the idea is to proactively offer sharing recommendations to the people who are featured in any given photo. Say you hit Quick Share on a family photo you took over the weekend. Rather than manually enter all of the contacts you'd like to share that image with, the feature can identify each, and automatically suggest sending the image to those contacts. It should speed up sharing pictures with groups of people after you take them, but, again, a little unsettling. Photo Assist updates\n\n Credit: Samsung\n\nThe Gallery app's Photo Assist feature is getting some upgrades in One UI 8.5. As of this version, Photo Assist now supports \"uninterrupted editing.\" That means you can make your AI-generated edits without needing to save in between each change. Previously, each edit would produce an entirely new image, so this makes the feature a bit more like a traditional photo editor. In addition, you'll be able to view all of the AI images you made in your edit history, and choose the one you like the most. \n\n You May Also Like\n\nSide note: Samsung says Photo Assist's Generate Edit feature requires an internet connection as well as a Samsung Account login. The feature also places a watermark on the image, so other people will know it was manipulated or generated with AI. Audio Broadcast\n\n Credit: Samsung\n\nOne UI 8.5 now supports sharing audio to other devices via Auracast, following Google's wider support for the standard back in September. If you have any LE Audio-supported devices, like headphones or speakers, you can use Audio Broadcast to share media from your Galaxy. This isn't limited to music, podcasts, or audio from videos, either, as Samsung says you can also broadcast your Galaxy's microphone to LE Audio devices, too. This feature is limited to Galaxy S25 devices, even after One UI 8.5 rolls out to other Galaxy phones. Storage Share\n\n Credit: Samsung\n\nIf you have a number of Samsung Galaxy devices, you might find Storage Share useful. This One UI 8.5 feature lets you manage your files across other devices, including tablets, PCs and even TVs, in the My Files app on your smartphone. \n\n What do you think so far?\n\nEnhanced Security ControlsSamsung is also expanding One UI's security features with this latest beta. The company is rolling out updates to Theft Protection with One UI 8.5, an existing feature that can lock your device if it's lost or stolen. That way, whoever picks it up won't have access to your data, or won't be able to erase the device and set it up as their own. In that same vein, Samsung is also launching Failed Authentication Lock, which locks the display after too many failed verification attempts. If a thief tries too many PIN combinations, or the fingerprint scanner fails too many times, your screen will lock them out. How to try the beta on your GalaxyWhile you can apply for the beta program today, first, consider the risks. Like all beta software, this version of One UI is currently in testing, which means there may be bugs and glitches that could interrupt your experience using your smartphone. If you understand these risks (and back up all important information ahead of time), here's what you need to know. First, this beta is only open for Galaxy S25 users in the U.S., Germany, India, Korea, Poland, and the UK. If you have an S24 or older, you'll need to wait for Samsung to roll out the One UI 8.5 beta more widely, or for the full release down the line. Next, you'll need to apply to join the beta from the Samsung Members app. If you don't have the app yet, download it from the Play Store, then follow the instructions to enroll in the beta.",

It's the model under the Pixel 10 Pro, which is also at its lowest price right now and has a much faster chip. As Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt says in her review, the Pixel 10 features a telephoto lens, brings the Pixelsnap (Google's version of MagSafe), and has new AI features. However, the ultrawide lens gets weaker, and there are some problems with the chip for third-party apps (but it can be fixed).This Pixel 10 has a lot of the same features you'll find in the Pixel Pro for $150 less, making it a great budget option for those who don't want or need all the fancy specs and features. It comes with a Google Tensor G5 chip, and the camera resolutions are 48MP, 13MP, and 10.8MP for the rear and 10.5MP for the front-facing one. You can expect about 24 hours of battery life, depending on your use. \n\n What do you think so far?\n\nOne of my favorite things about Pixel phones is the ongoing support for many years. My Pixel 6A still gets all of the updates and tons of AI features that make the phone feel fresh many years later, with the latest ones dropping in September. With the Pixel 10, you'll be getting a quality phone with software updates for a while (as long as seven years).\n\n Our Best Editor-Vetted Tech Deals Right Now\n\n Apple AirPods Pro 3 Noise Cancelling Heart Rate Wireless Earbuds\n\n —\n $219.99\n\n (List Price $249.00)\n\n Apple iPad 11\" 128GB A16 WiFi Tablet (Blue, 2025)\n\n —\n $279.00\n\n (List Price $349.00)\n\n Sony WH-1000XM5\n\n —\n $278.00\n\n (List Price $399.99)\n\n Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ 10.9\" 64GB Wi-Fi Tablet (Graphite)\n\n —\n $149.99\n\n (List Price $219.99)\n\n Apple Watch Series 11 [GPS 46mm] Smartwatch with Jet Black Aluminum Case with Black Sport Band - M/L.

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave. That, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes. As it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary. \n\n You May Also Like\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\n What do you think so far?\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",

    "description": "Music controls, an undo button for lap presses, and more.",
    "fullText": "I like Coros running because they do nearly everything Garmins do, at a lower cost. But there have always been a few areas where they fall short, which I’ve noted in my reviews. Now, that seems to be changing—the most recent beta firmware update adds a critical new feature while fixing some of my pet peeves.I tried out the new features through a public beta from Coros. You can (On iOS, you'll install a Testflight version of the Coros app, which can then give you access to the firmware update. On Android, you'll need to download the beta app, then go here to access the new beta firmware.) I tested these features out on a Pace 4, and I'm mostly happy with them.Coros watches can now control music playing on your phone\n\n I have not loaded any media onto this watch, but here it's playing a podcast from my phone.\n Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n\nIn my reviews of Coros watches, I’ve always docked a few points for how they handle music. Until recently, the watch could only play music files that you downloaded directly to it. That’s fine if you want to run without your phone, but for me (and many others) it’s an unnecessary annoyance—a smartwatch really should be able to display and control what’s playing on your phone. Garmin and Suunto have long had this capability, and Coros was the only major brand missing it. \n\n You May Also Like\n\nBut now it’s here. When you long-press the lap button to view your toolbox, you'll see two different apps. The familiar “music” plays downloaded music, and the new “media control” option does exactly what you’d expect: It shows the track information for whatever is playing on your phone, and it gives you buttons to play, pause, skip, or adjust volume. Was that so hard?Workouts no longer end themselves while you’re cooling downWhen I swapped my Garmin for a Coros this summer, one of my biggest complaints was that Coros watches pause your workout once you’ve completed all the steps. So if you have a 4.5-mile run programmed, but want to total five miles for the day, you have to remember to hit \"resume workout\" after the 4.5-mile run ends. I tend jog through that beep, thinking nothing of it, and then swear at my watch when I realize at the end that the last half-mile never got recorded.I prefer the way Garmin does it: After you complete a Garmin workout, the activity continues until you decide to manually stop it. Coros has apparently adopted that philosophy, as workouts now roll over into an open segment automatically. You can now undo a lap button press\n\n Hit the button in the lower right to undo this lap segment.\n Credit: Beth Skwarecki\n\nDuring an activity, pressing the lap button starts a new segment of the workout (or advances you to the next segment if you’re following a pre-written workout). I know I’m not the only one who sometimes presses this button by accident, so an “undo” option is nice. Garmin watches added this feature about a year ago. Coros adds it with this update. \n\n What do you think so far?\n\nUnfortunately the undo isn’t available for every lap button press. I do see it if I’m doing an unstructured workout and mark a lap—hitting the lap button again takes me back to the original lap in progress. But I don’t see an undo function if I’m following a workout that already has lap segments built in, or if I’m doing a strength workout (where the lap button switches between work and rest).My most common way of using the strength feature is to start an unstructured workout, then use the lap button to mark the end of each set and the start of my rest time. This way, I can keep track of rests during the workout and I know how many sets I’m doing. I might follow a pre-planned workout, but I never enter exercises from the watch during a workout. This is simple enough on Garmin, but on Coros, the watch used to ask me to enter at least a body part for each exercise. So if I’m doing five sets of bench press, I have to select “chest” each time I begin a set. This drove me up the wall, and I stopped using the rest timer at all—which makes the strength feature nearly useless. After the update, I can select a body part at the beginning of the workout, and that remains the active body part while I stop and start my sets. (“Full body” is an option, so I usually choose that one.) During the workout, hitting the start/stop button brings up a menu where I can switch body parts should I care to do so. Suddenly,. using the watch during my strength workouts seems like a viable option, instead of annoying.",

    "description": "Intra-team title battles turn toxic far more often than not. Andrew Benson analyses how McLaren have maintained relative harmony between Lando Norris and Oscar Piastri.",
    "fullText": "ByAndrew BensonF1 correspondentMcLaren's greatest achievement this year is arguably not what they have accomplished on track. It's something they have managed off it.The team won the constructors' championship with six races remaining, with Lando Norris eventually pipping Red Bull's Max Verstappen and his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri to the drivers' title in a three-way showdown at the season finale in Abu Dhabi.Norris and Piastri got there while remaining friendly. McLaren's ability to keep two evenly matched drivers, of a similar age and career development, competing for their first title in the same team without falling out with each other is almost unprecedented in modern F1.This sort of situation turns toxic far more often than not.Not just, most infamously, Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost at McLaren in 1989. But also Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet at Williams in 1986-7, Lewis Hamilton and Fernando Alonso at McLaren in 2007, Sebastian Vettel and Mark Webber at Red Bull in 2010, and Hamilton and Nico Rosberg at Mercedes in 2014-16.That list underlines just how difficult it is to keep two intensely driven individuals in relative harmony with each other for an entire year, while fighting for the biggest prize in their sport in identical cars, out of the same garage.It's hard enough to stop things getting noxious even when two title rivals are in different teams, such as in the tense relationship between Hamilton and Max Verstappen in 2021.But add in the claustrophobia of the rivals being in the same engineering meetings and team briefings, balancing race strategies, and the intensity only increases.Heading into this season, McLaren Racing chief executive officer Zak Brown and team principal Andrea Stella were well aware of the jeopardy, and consciously created a culture aimed at preventing the relationship between Norris and Piastri descending into disruptive conflict.They have a carefully thought out internal philosophy, applied with intelligence and empathy to two drivers who have been convinced that keeping things harmonious is the best solution for all.McLaren operate on a principle of fairness, trust and transparency, rooted in a basic principle that the drivers are allowed to race each other with equal treatment, with the proviso that they don't crash into each other.\"We are McLaren Racing,\" Stella says. \"We are here to race.\"We want to give our two drivers the possibility to express their talent, achieve their aspirations, but this needs to be done within the principles and the approach that we have contributed to build together with our drivers. Fairness, sportsmanship, and respect for one another.\"Stella says he \"leans on the experience\" he has gained - through 25 years in F1 with Ferrari and McLaren, and as a student of F1 - to construct what he considers the optimum way of running the team.The underlying philosophyImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, The McLaren team and drivers celebrated securing the constructors' championship at Singapore Grand Prix, with six races still remaining in the seasonThe starting point was that the only place the team cannot be fully united is in the quest for the drivers' championship. So don't ignore that. Put it first, and work from there.\"The way we operate now is the result of having learned so many lessons,\" Stella says. \"We talk to the driver - straight talking.\"And if we get something wrong now, it needs to be, 'We didn't think about it.' But it can't be because we haven't talked openly and straight and honestly enough. Because that's the recipe to have a problem.\"Why this approach? Because if issues are not discussed when they arise, they are likely to pop up the next time there is a moment of stress, when they are more likely to be expressed in a negative way, and so become harder to control.Stella's achievement has been to get Norris and Piastri to buy into the idea that trusting the team to operate fairly is in their best interests, as well as those of the team, and consequently that the drivers should behave accordingly.He has probably been aided in this by the fact that both have spent their entire careers at McLaren, are growing up with the team and, thanks to their relationships with the management, trust what the team are trying to create and achieve.The drivers have reflected the culture Stella has constructed in repeatedly making two key points this year.First, that open, fair competition between two evenly matched team-mates drives McLaren forward by consistently raising the bar of performance, and gives them a collective advantage over rivals who don't have that; and second, that they both wanted this to be their first title campaign with McLaren, not their only one.Norris, who eventually prevailed thanks to his third-place finish in Abu Dhabi, says having \"two drivers who respect the team and are not selfish\" is fundamental in this.\"We work very well as team-mates,\" he says. \"We've helped the team in a very good way. There's been plenty of examples [in the past] of things not going as smoothly as they have done. And the team's then gone in a downward spiral. That's what we want to avoid as a team - that's our priority.\"He adds: \"I've always got on well with my team-mates since karting. I've always wanted to because it just makes my life more fun, more enjoyable, and that's also why I'm here - because I love what I do. So, the more I can do that, the better.\"But we still very much understand that we work for McLaren, we want the best for the team, we work very hard.\"As drivers always do, you try and maximise your own performance more than anything. But when we step out of the car, we can still have a joke, we still have laughs in our debriefs, and we still enjoy everything away from the track.\"Off track, there is no tension between Norris and Piastri. They are friendly but not best friends.What does that mean? Well, for example, if they are at an event, they will chat and eat with each other, quite happy in each other's company. But they probably won't be messaging when they've left.Both have been firm in their conviction that they would rather race this way and risk being beaten to the title by a rival - as so nearly happened with Verstappen this season - than have one prioritised by the team to the detriment of the other.Piastri says: \"On both sides of the garage, we want to win because we've been the best driver, the best team, including against the other car in the team.\"You always want to earn things on merit and you want to be able to beat everyone, including your team-mate.\"That gives Lando and I the best chance of our personal goals of trying to become drivers' world champion, while also achieving the main result for the team, which is the constructors' championship.\"How it works in practiceImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Oscar Piastri and Lando Norris collided at the start of the US Grand Prix sprint in October, putting both drivers out of the race. In June, they collided in Canada. Norris apologised for that incident, which forced his retirement from the grand prix.A small group of senior figures at McLaren discuss with the drivers how they are going to approach their racing. They review what happened after each grand prix, and apply the lessons for the following race.This happens in formal meetings, more informal conversations and ad hoc.And they keep building on that process, over and over again.This is all well and good in theory, but it's only sustainable in practice if everyone sticks to the principles when problems arise, as they inevitably do through an F1 season.In 2025, there have been a number of races where equality and harmony have been tested - particularly Hungary, Italy, Singapore and Austin. In Hungary, Norris was allowed to switch to a one-stop strategy after a bad start left him fifth, and ended up beating Piastri, whose two-stop from an early second place saw him spend the final laps trying and failing to pass Norris for the win.In Italy, a decision to invert the natural pit-stop choreography after they had spent the race running in the order Norris-Piastri behind Verstappen was followed by a slow pit stop for Norris, and Piastri being asked to hand back the second place he had inherited.In Singapore, Norris scrambled past Piastri into third place at the first series of corners, banging wheels in the process, leading to the Australian saying over the radio: \"Are we cool with Lando just barging me out of the way?\"In Austin, an attempted cut-back move by Piastri on Norris at the first corner of the sprint race ended up in a collision that took both of them out.Externally, these situations have either led to accusations that Norris was being favoured, or that McLaren were meddling too much, or both.Internally, they were dealt with quietly, behind closed doors, and with the apparent result that everyone came away satisfied it had been resolved in the best possible way.McLaren insiders have told BBC Sport that the driver meetings really are conducted in the way they are externally presented - issues are discussed openly, constructively and calmly, and a resolution is arrived at from which everyone can move on with equanimity, even if they had issues with what happened at the time.If there has been any deviation from that in the drivers' minds privately, they have certainly not given any hint of it in public.Piastri has rejected any suggestions that the team was not being fair, saying he's \"very happy that there's no favouritism or bias\".And Norris says: \"We still always have the right to question it. We're never going to just go around - because I think it's just a racing driver's mind - and be happy to accept whatever the team wants to do or what they think is correct.\"I understand that a lot of people have different opinions and think maybe other things are correct. But I still stand by the fact that Andrea and Oscar and all of us together are confident that our approach is better than what other people's are.\"Brown says that any idea the team were siding with Norris is \"nonsense\".He explains that when they let Norris switch to a one-stop in Hungary, \"Andrea and I were like, 'This ain't gonna work.' But it was a free punt, and Lando drove brilliantly.\"Monza, he says, was \"just like what happened in Hungary the year before\", when Norris let Piastri by for the win after a similar pit-lane arrangement.\"If the lead car is prepared to sacrifice their rights to the first call to help his team-mate, who's actually his number one competitor in the championship, that's great teamwork,\" Brown says.\"So I understand what it looks like from the outside, but it's not what's going on on the inside, and we're trying so hard to give them equal opportunity and let them race hard. I wish everyone recognised more of that.\"But I've definitely come to the conclusion there's too many fans with too many views that we've just got to be comfortable with how we're going racing inside McLaren, and that's what's most important to us.\"Can this be sustained into 2026? That's impossible to know.Norris and Piastri seem level-headed and humble. They are also both intensely ambitious.Becoming world champion can change drivers. The more successful they become, the more demanding they get, especially in their requirements off-track.McLaren have managed Norris and Piastri with sensitivity and effectiveness, but the challenges do not lessen just because that has been the case so far.If anyone has an understanding of how hard it is to pull this off, it is Fernando Alonso.The two-time champion has lived this dynamic in a title fight, and he's worked with both Stella and Brown - Stella at Ferrari then McLaren from 2010-18, and Brown when the American came on board at McLaren in 2016.\"The credit has to go for Andrea and Zak that they created a winning structure and car, but they were also able to manage the drivers for the benefit of the team,\" Alonso says.\"It is less exciting to watch and for media because there is no controversy in some of the wins, not yet.\"But instead of thinking that way, we should think how well Andrea and Zak are managing everything.\"Related topicsFormula 1More on this storyNorris keen to 'live a normal few days' and 'forget I drive in F1'Published14 hours agoHow Norris achieved his lifetime's ambition by 'winning it my way'Published1 day agoNorris is 'only just getting going' - and rank British world championsPublished18 hours agoBacked by his family, propelled by his talent - the rise of NorrisPublished1 day agoQuiz: How well do you know F1 champion Norris?Published1 day agoAbu Dhabi Grand Prix ReviewLando Norris: The Making of a World Champion",

The Duke's Course, which is three miles from the centre of the Fife university town, will become the Craigtoun Course, after a nearby country park. A heathland course unlike the links which dominate the home of golf, the Duke's was opened by Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor in 1995.He later became captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, which is based in St Andrews.Getty ImagesAndrew is a keen golfer and attended the 2018 Open at Carnoustie as a spectatorAndrew has given up his honorary membership, as part of his retreat from public life in the wake of the scandal about his close friendship with the paedophile and sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. The course and club are also to come under the management of the St Andrews Links Trust on a long-term lease. The club's logo is also being changed, to remove the royal association.An illustration featuring trees will replace a lion rampant holding a saltire flag.The trust already runs seven public courses around the Fife town, including the world famous Old Course, which hosts the Open Championship every five years. Until 5 January, the Duke's will continue to be run by golf resort operator Kohler, alongside its ownership of the Old Course Hotel.From then on it will be know as the Craigtoun Course.Private estateFollowing a growing public outcry about his links to Epstein, Andrew was stripped of titles such as the Duke of York and his status as prince, becoming Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor.As part of that announcement in October, Andrew was also to leave Royal Lodge and to move into some other accommodation in Sandringham, the King's private estate in Norfolk.Andrew has also faced calls from Democrat members of the US Congress to give evidence to a committee investigating Epstein's activities.Mr Mountbatten-Windsor had not replied to the request by the end of their deadline last month.A press release confirmed the course would take on a \"revitalised identity\" but it did not mention the former prince.Neil Coulson, chief executive of St Andrews Links Trust, said: \"The agreement for The Craigtoun Course will see the first new course added to the Home of Golf's portfolio in 18 years and presents an ideal opportunity to expand the golf experiences we offer.\"We are delighted to have reached agreement with the Old Course Hotel and look forward to taking over what it is already a significant asset for St Andrews and Scotland and building on its reputation.\"Andrew's move out of Royal Lodge may not happen until new yearHow will Andrew's titles be removed and what happens next?Andrew Mountbatten-WindsorSt Andrews",

In summary, we're about to submit planning next month.\"Irish FA announces National Training Centre at GalgormPublished26 FebruaryThe journey to Northern Ireland's national training centrePublished25 FebruaryIFA can deliver phase one of project 'without Northern Ireland Football Fund'Giving a brief overview of the path forward, Fitzgerald hopes that after submission of planning permission in January, council approval will come by the end of 2026.In 2027, the focus will be on \"procurement and construction\", and the aim is by the \"mid part of 2028\" it will be \"operational\", but Fitzgerald believes it will be \"too much of a building site\" to be used as a training base for Euro 2028.While not disclosing costs of the phased project, Fitzgerald explained that the funding for it is coming from \"three main sources\" - the IFA, Fifa Foward and Uefa Hat-Trick schemes, and the Northern Ireland Football Fund.The long-awaited Northern Ireland Football Fund is sub-regional funding primarily for clubs in NI, but Fitzgerald said there is also a strand from the fund set aside for the National Training Centre.\"The first [source] being our own reserves at the Irish FA, a portion of it will come with that,\" he said.\"Then, every time there is a World Cup or Euros, Fifa and Uefa give all their members a capital dividend and we have saved those over the last few cycles and have a good proportion of that to put towards the funding.\"Finally, the Northern Ireland Football Fund, there has always been a strand dedicated to the National Training Centre, so we are working closely with the Department for Communities to realise a portion of that fund for this project as well.\"In October, Crusaders and Derry City released statements to confirm they would launch legal proceedings after their bids to progress to the next stage of the Northern Ireland Football Fund's application process were rejected.Fitzgerald allayed fears that such legal proceedings could delay the releasing of funds as the clubs will be receiving money from a different pot than the IFA.He did add that to complete the full three phases of the project, the IFA are reliant on the money from the Northern Ireland Football Fund to be released soon.\"The situation around the clubs, we understand, doesn't affect the strand of the Northern Ireland Football Fund that relates to the National Football Centre, so from our point of view it's business as usual,\" he said.\"We have phased the project, and we'll deliver phase one which is primarily the showpiece training building with the facilities and two elite-standard pitches. \"That will only serve part of our needs and our senior teams, but that is more than we have today and that phase will come with our own funding.\"We are confident we will deliver it without the Northern Ireland Football Fund - it will help us in phase two, broadening out into a national facility.\"National Training Centre 'can't come soon enough' - HughesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Aaron Hughes won 112 caps for Northern IrelandIFA technical director Aaron Hughes said having the facility open and functional for senior men's and women's teams by 2028 is a \"realistic outcome\" and \"it can't come soon enough\".The 112-cap former NI defender said he has mainly been involved with the \"football element\" in the design of the venue.\"I've put in a lot of work around the detail of the actual building and the finer detail of the football element of it, and looking at the inner workings of the building, changing rooms, gym and those different things,\" he continued.\"We're working within a budget, and we have to stay in those parameters - we have to create the best we can that fits all our needs. \"It's been exciting as it's taking shape and things come to life a little bit more with the drawings and animations - it's starting to get quite exciting.\"Related topicsNorthern Ireland Men's Football TeamNorthern Ireland SportNorthern Ireland Women's Football TeamIrish Football",

    "description": "Cardiff City's court case against Nantes over the death of Emiliano Sala will finally get under way in France on Monday.",
    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Emiliano Sala (left) was unveiled as a Cardiff City player in January 2019Published8 December 2025ByChris WathanBBC Sport WalesA French courtroom on Monday afternoon will be the setting for what could be the final act in the tragic saga of Emiliano Sala.At a hearing in Nantes, Cardiff City Football Club will argue the case that they are owed more than £100m in damages following the death of a player they believe could have kept them in the Premier League.It is almost seven years since Sala, a 28-year-old Argentine striker, and pilot David Ibbotson died in a plane crash while travelling over the English Channel to join his new club.Just days earlier he had been announced as Cardiff City's record signing after agreeing a £15m deal to join the south Wales club from French side Football Club de Nantes.There have been bitter accusations and recriminations ever since, including a succession of legal cases, leading to Monday's hearing at Nantes commercial court - itself having been adjourned from 22 September.Cardiff say the French club are liable for financial losses suffered in the wake of the accident. Nantes have previously rejected Cardiff's claims.The backgroundImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, David Henderson served an 18-month prison sentence for arranging the flight in which footballer Emiliano Sala diedIn December 2018, Nantes striker Sala had been identified by Cardiff as a player that could provide the goals to help them in a Premier League relegation struggle.The following month, on 19 January 2019, a £15m deal between the clubs was announced.However, two days later as Sala travelled to Cardiff from Nantes, he and pilot Ibbotson died when the plane they were in crashed into the sea near Guernsey.The flight was later deemed to have been unlicensed, with the man who organised it - plane operator David Henderson - found guilty in October 2021 of endangering the safety of an aircraft and sentenced to 18 months in prison.What is Cardiff's claim?There has been a dispute between Cardiff and Nantes stretching back to the immediate aftermath of the crash, with the Welsh club initially refusing to pay the first instalment of the transfer fee until investigations into accountability had taken place.The row eventually led to football world governing body Fifa ordering Cardiff to pay - and the Bluebirds appealing against the decision at the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS).With CAS upholding Fifa's ruling, Cardiff paid the first instalment in January 2023 - ending an English Football League (EFL) transfer embargo in the process - and subsequently paid the remaining balance.But the football club have always maintained they were prepared to take further action and in April 2024 lodged a complaint with Nantes commercial court, seeking damages of 120.2m euros (£104m).The estimate for damages stems from the claimed financial and reputational losses represented by Cardiff's relegation from the Premier League in 2019.Cardiff's team will present evidence from court-approved experts, including a statistical report compiled by football data company FC Analytics, that the club says shows Sala could have given them as much as a 62% greater chance of staying in the Premier League in that 2018-19 season.In terms of the amount of damages, the sum Cardiff are seeking is based on independent analysis of the loss of income that followed relegation, the subsequent impact on the club's overall value, as well as the original transfer fee.Nantes did not respond to approaches for comment but have previously disputed Cardiff's claim. Their position is said to be unchanged.Cardiff's Sala court action against Nantes adjournedPublished17 SeptemberTransfer: The Emiliano Sala StoryLatest Cardiff City news, analysis and fan viewsWhat is Cardiff's argument?Cardiff's claim is based on their argument that former football agent Willie McKay was working on behalf of Nantes when he arranged the flight via Henderson.Sala had been offered a commercial flight by Cardiff to return to Wales but he had wanted more time to say his goodbyes in Nantes.McKay was not a registered agent and has previously claimed he was helping his son Mark - who was the acting agent in the deal - but did charter the flight.Nantes have previously denied Willie McKay was working on their behalf.Cardiff brought civil proceedings against Willie McKay for the disclosure of emails and documents relating to the transfer, with an out-of-court agreement made in February 2024.They say those messages prove the link and therefore Nantes' ultimate responsibility for both the flight and the subsequent financial impact on Cardiff when they were relegated.How does this case differ?Fifa's ruling that Cardiff should pay the transfer fee was based on the fact that contractually the deal had been completed and so payment was due.CAS agreed and said it could not take into account other aspects, such as the responsibility for the flight or the potential damages, with a further hearing at the Swiss Federal Tribunal agreeing CAS did not have the jurisdiction.Cardiff believe this will be the first time a judge will listen to the issues the club has with the conduct of the parties in the transfer, saying that little of what will be discussed at this hearing has been examined or considered in the past.The case will also be heard by consular judges - company owners or directors from business rather than the legal world - elected to the position.Cardiff have pursued the claim in France to avoid any issues over jurisdiction.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Fans paid tribute to new signing Emiliano Sala outside Cardiff City Stadium following the striker's deathWhat happens now?The hearing is expected to begin at 16:00 GMT on Monday.No witnesses will be called by either party and evidence has already been submitted and seen by judges, with both clubs' legal teams putting forward their cases.The judges will then retire to consider their verdict. There are two elements of that decision: the question of liability and then, if necessary, how much of the damages being sought should be paid.For example, it is possible that if Cardiff were successful, they might only be awarded a percentage of the £100m-plus sum they have claimed.When is a verdict expected?While theoretically the hearing could take only a matter of hours, it is expected to be months before a judgement is handed down.Indeed, it could be as late as March before the clubs discover the outcome.Even then, there are avenues of appeal available to both parties.But, seven years on from his transfer, this hearing is expected to at least be the beginning of the end of Sala's tragic story.Related topicsCardiff CityWelsh FootballLeague OneFootball",

seven days later than the usual timing before major tournaments.Mali coach Tom Saintfiet described the ruling as \"catastrophic\" for preparations.\"Everyone in Europe thinks African football is not important,\" he added. \"It shows a lack of respect and I'm angry.\"Some clubs may attempt to come to ad-hoc arrangements with federations in order to keep players for longer.For example, Manchester United play Bournemouth in the Premier League on 15 December and may aim to hold on to their Afcon-bound contingent of forward Bryan Mbuemo (Cameroon), winger Amad Diallo (Ivory Coast) and defender Noussair Mazraoui (Morocco) for another 24 hours.Who are the Afcon favourites?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Morocco have only won Afcon once, in 1976, but fans will still be expecting the Atlas Lions to lift the trophy on home soilThe hosts are the overwhelming favourites.Morocco are on a winning run of 18 consecutive victories -

It was a joke that got out of hand.\"He added: \"Nobody wants to go to jail.\"Barton given suspended prison sentencesBarton, who has 2.7m followers on X, repeatedly referred to Vine as \"bike nonce\" and said in one post: \"If you see this fella by a primary school call 999,\" and \"Beware Man with Camera on his helmets cruising past primary schools. Call the Cops if spotted.\"He was found not guilty of six other allegations that he sent a grossly offensive electronic communication with intent to cause distress or anxiety between January and March 2024.Jurors cleared Barton, now of Widnes, Cheshire, over the commentary analogy with the Wests but ruled the superimposed image was grossly offensive.Giving evidence, Barton, who managed Fleetwood Town and Bristol Rovers, said he believed he was the victim of a \"political prosecution\" and denied his aim was \"to get clicks and promote himself\".ReutersBarton told reporters \"it was a joke that got out of hand\" as he left the courtOn sentencing, Judge Menary KC told Barton: \"Robust debate, satire, mockery and even crude language may fall within permissible free speech. \"But when posts deliberately target individuals with vilifying comparisons to serial killers or false insinuations of paedophilia, designed to humiliate and distress, they forfeit their protection.\"As the jury concluded, your offences exemplify behaviour that is beyond this limit – amounting to a sustained campaign of online abuse that was not mere commentary but targeted, extreme and deliberately harmful.\"He said Barton launched a \"racially charged and sexist attack\" on Aluko which asserted that a black female broadcaster held her position solely due to her race.The judge said while he was convinced the \"custodial threshold\" had been crossed in this case, he was prepared to suspend those jail terms.He noted Barton had taken steps to moderate his online behaviour but added \"only time will tell whether this resolve endures\".Two-year restraining orders were issued against each of his victims which includes publishing any reference to them on any social media platform or broadcast medium.PA/REUTERS/PAThe charges related to posts he made on X about Jeremy Vine, Lucy Ward and Eni AlukoFollowing the verdict, a Cheshire Police spokesperson said the force hoped the case would deter others using social media to share \"abusive and hateful messages\".They said Barton's posts \"would have been seen by hundreds, if not thousands of people, and yet he showed no regard or consideration for how this would impact on his victims and their wellbeing\".\"The sentence handed to him today comes with a number of strict conditions and should he breach these in any way he may face the prospect of time behind bars.\"Reacting to news of Barton's sentencing, Vine said: 'I'm happy the case is over'Reacting to news of Barton's sentencing, Vine said: \"I'm happy the case is over. \"Joey Barton has been made to pay a lot for his disgusting lies and abuse, but I fear he'll keep offending until the day he dies.\"In his victim impact statement, which was earlier read in court, the broadcaster said Barton's actions had been \"profoundly traumatising\".\"I felt my reputation was sullied,\" he said.\"Joey Barton is a small man who feeds off the pain of others.\"In her statement, Ward described Barton's posts as \"irresponsible\" and \"hateful\".\"I am now constantly afraid,\" she said. \"Not just of the defendant, but the people he has incited against me and his history only heightens my fear.\"She added the \"barrage of hate\" has left her \"questioning my own worth\".In Aluko's impact statement, she said Barton's comments were \"abhorrent and the most offensive criticism she has experienced in her life\" and she had to step up security as a result. \"I remain deeply upset with the malicious comparison to serial killers and feel humiliated given that millions of people will have seen this comparison,\" she said.It was unwarranted and unjustified, she said, adding that as a result she was too scared to leave her house, resulting in cancelled engagements and loss of income.'Pile on'Anti-discrimination charity Kick It Out welcomed the decision to hand Barton a criminal sentence for his \"grossly offensive comments\" made towards football pundits Eni Aluko and Lucy Ward.\"Not only did the harmful posts create a pile on, leaving two talented and qualified women fearing for their safety, but they were laced with misogyny and, in Eni's case, some were racially aggravated,\" it said.\"We once again praise Eni, Lucy and Jeremy Vine for standing up to someone who thinks this type of abuse is some sort of joke. \"Racism and misogyny is not banter, it's discrimination, and with reports to Kick It Out on the rise this season, it's everyone's responsibility to stand up to it.\"Listen to the best of BBC Radio Merseyside on Sounds and follow BBC Merseyside on Facebook, X, and Instagram.

    "fullText": "An Infamous Shipwreck Revealed Its First Treasure joecicak - Getty Images\n\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:Experts brought to the surface the first treasures from the 1700s Spanish galleon the San José.Considered the Holy Grail of shipwrecks, the Colombian government is planning to preserve these first finds.Included in the haul is a cannon, two porcelain cups, and three gold and bronze coins.The hauling up of the world’s most valuable shipwreck has to start somewhere. So crews have brought to the surface three small gold and bronze coins from the 1700s, pulled from the Spanish galleon the San José, considered the Holy Grail of all shipwrecks. But there’s plenty more still sitting 1,970 feet below the ocean’s surface off the coast of Colombia, as much as $17 billion worth.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe San José, sunk by the British Royal Navy in the Caribbean during the War of Spanish Succession in 1708, was full of value. The ship was laden with 10 years’ worth of gold, silver, and gems, tribute from Spanish colonies in Latin America headed back to the Spanish king. Experts have now pulled up the first pieces from the ship, including coins, a cannon, and porcelain cups.An English cannon sent the ship—part of the Flota de Tierra Firme fleet that left Peru in 1707—to the ocean’s floor. where it laid dormant for hundreds of years. The Colombian government claims it found the ship in 2015. Current estimates of the on-board value have ranged from $10 billion to $17 billion in today’s currency, sparking a custody battle between the Spanish and Colombian government over who has the rights to the loot.A recent study confirmed the presence of macuquinas coins—knowns as cobs in English—strewn across the wreck site around the San José. The Colombian Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Knowledge has taken the next steps to recover the treasure, using a robotic underwater vehicle to secure samples of the cargo.The team used the equipment to search the structure of the vessel without disturbing the galleon, picking three coins, a bronze cannon (as well as fragments of wood, rope, and sediment from the cannon) and two porcelain cups—each with a different style. The team took the items to the Center for Archaeological and Historical Research and the National Museum of Colombia for preservation.AdvertisementAdvertisementAlhena Caicedo Fernandez, director of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History said in a translated statement that collecting the objects “opens the possibility that citizen can approach, through material testimony, the history of the San José galleon.”An estimated 200 tons of gold, silver, and uncut gemstones were aboard the ship, the result of 10 years of taxation saved up before the fleet’s planed voyage back to Spain. The macuquinas were the main currency in the Americas during the time, typically cut from gold or silver ingots, and were the primary way the Spanish transported large volumes of wealth from the Americas to Europe. These coin hoards likely formed part of the royal treasure dispatched from Peru. But when the fleet of 18 ships left Cartagena bound for Spain on June 8, 1708, it was attacked by five British warships. The cannon battle resulted in the explosion of the San José’s gunpowder stores, sinking the 150-foot-long ship.More in WorldCar bomb kills 5 people, including 3 officers, in front of police stationCBS News1.4KAncient piggy bank: Excavation in France reveals 40,000 Roman coins from 1,700 years agoJerusalem PostPorsches across Russia suddenly stop workingThe IndependentAir India Totally Forgot It Owned A Plane, Now Owes 13 Years Of Parking FeesJalopnikThe shipwreck—and treasured cargo—has sat on the ocean floor ever since.

    "fullText": "Media caption, Mark Selby's best UK Championship momentsBySteve SutcliffeBBC Sport journalist at York BarbicanPublished7 December 2025466 CommentsUpdated 8 December 2025Mark Selby held off a spirited Judd Trump fightback to win 10-8 as he claimed his third UK Championship title in York.The four-time Crucible winner laid the platform for his first triumph in one of snooker's prestigious Triple Crown events since 2021, and his 10th overall, in a scintillating first session on Sunday afternoon.\"I set my target every year to win one of these three [Triple Crown] tournaments. It's not easy to do but that's my goal - and if I pick up some other tournaments along the way, fantastic,\" Selby told BBC Sport.\"I think I speak for all the top boys, the other tournaments are great but you are judged by these Triple Crown events - like the Grand Slams in tennis - so I'm chuffed to win another.\"Selby was almost flawless as he established a 5-0 advantage, which defending champion Trump narrowed to 6-2.However, when play resumed Selby's progress towards a first UK title since 2016 was checked as Trump took three of the first four frames - including a controversial 11th, in which Selby was initially awarded a free ball by referee Olivier Marteel.That decision was reversed after Selby agreed with his opponent's protestations that it was not a free ball - which allows a player to nominate a ball when snookered after a foul - although subsequent television replays, and six-time world champion Steve Davis, suggested the referee's initial judgement had been correct.With Trump fluking the red he was snookered on and then constructing his first century of the match in the following frame, it felt like a pivotal moment.However, Selby was not to be denied the £250,000 top prize on offer for winning the 25th ranking event of his career, despite some nervy moments.While a break of 91 put him 8-5 up, he missed several routine pots as world number one Trump clawed his way back to 8-7 with runs of 125 and 55. In a tense finale, Selby and Trump traded frames before the 42-year-old secured his victory with a composed break of 69.Selby close to brilliant bestMedia caption, Mark Selby speaks to Hazel Irvine after his triumphOnly Ronnie O'Sullivan (23), Stephen Hendry (18) and Steve Davis (15) have now won more Triple Crown events than Selby, who overtook John Higgins this weekend.And, having defeated Trump in consecutive finals, there are signs that he has rediscovered the form that made him such a dominant force in the game between 2012 and 2017.During that period Selby topped the rankings and collected two UK crowns, one Masters title and won three times at the Crucible as his granite matchplay and ability to score heavily made him a fearsome opponent.However, more recently he has considered retirement and battled to overcome well-documented mental health issues, and other personal struggles, away from snooker. \"I've always said the time I stop enjoying it is the time I stop playing and, for a while, I wasn't enjoying it. I was performing poorly and not enjoying the challenge.\"Winning breeds confidence. The last two tournaments I have won I have played Judd, who is an unbelievable player.\" Questions for Trump as he ends 2025 without silverwareMedia caption, Best shots of the UK Championship snookerTrump began the day looking to become only the fourth player to successfully defend the UK crown after all-time greats Davis, Hendry and O'Sullivan.But by the end of it he had suffered his third defeat of the season in a final, having been pipped in a decider by Jack Lisowski at the Northern Ireland Open in October and by Selby at the Champion of Champions.With him not being in action again until the Masters in January, it means that the 36-year-old's record of having won a piece of silverware every year since 2013 comes to an end.And, while Selby will be automatically installed as the favourite when the top 16 players in the world line-up at Alexandra Palace, there will be more question marks around Trump.He has openly talked about needing to change his cue again in the intervening period and his practice regime has also suffered, while his brother has had visa issues that have prevented him joining Trump at his Dubai base. \"It's been a struggle really. The whole tournament I didn't play great and Mark was much the better player,\" said Trump.\"I'll definitely practice and be back to normal with my brother back in Dubai. I've not been as sharp going into events. I am still waiting for that one game, that one spark.\"I'll go away now, regroup and put in the practice, and look forward to the rest of the season.\"Related topicsSnookerMore on this storyRelive UK Championship final as Selby edges past TrumpDefending champion Murphy to face Wu at MastersPublished1 day ago",

    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jazza Dickens made his professional debut in 2011ByBobbie JacksonBBC Sport journalistPublished8 December 2025Liverpool's Jazza Dickens said he has been upgraded to WBA super-featherweight champion after Lamont Roach was stripped of the title.American Roach was crowned champion in 2023 and defended once the following year but his last two fights, which have both ended in majority draws, have taken place at lightweight and light-welterweight respectively.Dickens, 34, last fought in July, stopping Russia's Albert Batyrgaziev in round four to win the WBA interim belt.\"A lifetime of hard work is starting to pay off. Huge thanks to all the people who've put me in this position,\" Dickens told BBC Sport.BBC Sport has contacted the WBA for confirmation.Dickens will become Britain's fourth reigning male champion along with Nick Ball, Lewis Crocker and Fabio Wardley.He is scheduled to face undefeated Japanese super-featherweight Hayato Tsutsumi in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia on 27 December.Dickens has won 36 of his 41 fights, with 15 of those victories coming inside the distance, and two of his five defeats have come at world level.In 2016, Dickens lost to WBA super-bantamweight champion Guillermo Rigondeaux, of Cuba, and he also came up short against compatriot Kid Galahad for the IBF featherweight title in 2021.Dickens has competed across three weight classes and was British champion at super-bantamweight and European champion at featherweight.Related topicsBoxingBoxing schedule and results 2025Published29 NovemberWatch every Born to Brawl episodePublished28 April 2024More boxing from the BBCNotifications, social media and more with BBC SportPublished16 August",

    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Salah (pictured at training on Monday) joined Liverpool from Roma in 2017ByAadam PatelFootball reporterAtMilanPublished8 December 20251617 CommentsMohamed Salah has been left out of the squad for Liverpool's Champions League match at Inter Milan.The club have decided to remove Salah from selection for a short period after he gave an explosive interview on Saturday, claiming that he was \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool and his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.Sources told BBC Sport that the decision has been taken with the full support of Slot and that it is in the best interest of all parties involved for Salah to have a brief period away from selection given the nature and timing of the player's public comments.It is understood there will be no formal disciplinary action taken by the club.The 33-year-old is set to depart for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday and also looks likely to also miss Liverpool's game against Brighton on Saturday.Liverpool's 19-man squad flew to Milan on Monday afternoon and Slot will speak at the news conference alongside Alisson Becker at 18:45 GMT.Salah gave his interview after he was an unused substitute in Saturday's 3-3 draw at Leeds United - the third straight game the Egypt international has started on the bench.'Disgraceful' Salah comments have caused 'carnage'Published8 hours ago'I am not weak' says Slot, but Salah could returnPublished10 hours agoMedia caption, 'He's put his team-mates in jeopardy' - CoadyThe Reds let a 2-0 lead slip in the draw at Leeds, with Salah an unused substitute for the game.The previous two games had seen Salah come on as a substitute in a 1-1 home draw at Sunderland, while he was left on the bench in a 2-0 win at West Ham.His last start was in a 4-1 defeat by PSV Eindhoven at Anfield in a Champions League group game and his last goal came in a 2-0 win at Aston Villa on Saturday, 1 November.Salah has scored five goals in 18 appearances in the Premier League and Champions League this season.Overall, he has 250 goals in 420 Liverpool appearances and his 29 top-flight goals in the 2024-25 campaign helped the Anfield side win the Premier League title last season.Salah, who joined Liverpool from Roma in 2017, signed a new two-year contract with the club in April.BBC Sport pundit and former England striker Wayne Rooney has said Salah is \"destroying his legacy\" at the club and said prior to the forward being left out of the Inter game that Slot should not involve him in Italy or for the home match against Brighton on Saturday.\"In my head, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now,\" Salah said on Saturday.\"I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go to Africa Cup of Nations. I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.\"Media caption, Rooney: 'Disrespectful' Salah comments 'threw Liverpool under the bus'Salah is destroying his legacy - RooneyPublished1 day agoSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by LiverpoolPublished2 days agoIs there any way back for Salah and Liverpool?Published1 day agoAnalysisMedia caption, Salah trains but will not travel to MilanSalah may not have made the trip to Milan but the fact that he was training with his teammates on Monday morning suggests that there is a way back at Liverpool for the Egyptian.Leaving him out of the squad was a decision made in consultation with Slot and it leaves no doubt about who is in charge but it could have been much worse - Salah wasn't even fined by the club for his outburst at Leeds.Given his choice of words, it would not have come as a surprise if Salah wasn't allowed to train with the first team but the 33-year-old was all smiles in front of the cameras on Monday.His words on Saturday implied that an exit in January was possible but BBC Sport understands that the Egyptian isn't actively looking for a way out. And the notion that it is in the best interests of all parties for Salah to have a period away from selection indicates that Liverpool still see a future with the current PFA Players' Player of the YearFurthermore, there are currently no plans for Salah to leave Liverpool any earlier than December 15 (which is the latest release date) for the Africa Cup of Nations.It's worth noting Salah's words when he signed his new contract in April: \"I have played eight years here, hopefully it's going to be 10. I'm enjoying my life here, enjoying my football. I have had the best years of my career here.\"There is little doubt that Salah spoke from the heart on Sunday. Missing out on the Inter game will hurt him but here is still a chance for him at Liverpool under Slot and that will be the question on everyone's lips when the Liverpool boss speaks to the media on Monday evening.Related topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Image source, SNSImage caption, Aberdeen are considering moving from Pittodrie StadiumByTyrone SmithBBC Sport Scotland Senior ReporterPublished8 hours agoAberdeen have been invited to a meeting on Friday with city council leaders they hope \"will be the first big step forward in some time\" following a war of words over plans for a new stadium.The Scottish Premiership club warned last week that the city risked missing out on a \"transformational\" boost to the local economy after a local newspaper report suggested their latest proposal for a new beachfront community stadium was going to be thrown out by the local authority.Aberdeen chairman David Cormack told the club's annual meeting on Monday \"it would be pretty catastrophic\" for the city if the football club moved away to a new stadium outside the centre.Following the meeting, chief executive Alan Burrows told BBC Scotland: \"We remain positive in terms of looking towards these discussions on Friday.\"As recently as today, we were asked to attend, Dave and I, a meeting with the senior representatives from the local council and we are going to go along on Friday and discuss the art of the possible.'We remain absolutely positive in terms of the relationship. We want to have a good relationship with the local authority, we want to work together in partnership for the betterment of the city and its residents and we look forward to Friday to see what that might bring.\"Aberdeen finding their groove after shaky startPublished1 day agoBurrows replied \"I hope it is closer\" when asked how the situation had changed since the same question was raised at last year's annual meeting.\"Even if we were to go to the meeting on Friday and the council leaders told us they were fully behind it and were going to support it, it would still take a significant amount of time to go through all the usual processes of building a stadium,\" he pointed out. \"But I think hopefully what the call to have a meeting on Friday will be the first big step forward in some time that will allow us to make solid plans about what the next stage might be and that next stage will be hopefully is a real bona fide feasibility study to see just what it would cost, what it would bring, all these different factors.\"The stadium issue topped the agenda at a pretty positive annual meeting given recent form leaves Jimmy Thelin's side unbeaten in eight games.The Swede's side had only won twice in the previous 12 and Burrows was asked if at any point the board were thinking they might need to start searching for a new manager.\"Responsible board of directors and senior executives are always looking at what they are doing and monitoring the performances,\" he replied.\"But I think what I would also say is that there is a lot of confidence and faith in Jimmy. The run of results we were on was difficult, but what was absolutely resolute all the way through was our belief in the plan, belief in the people and that continues apace today.\"Related topicsAberdeenScottish PremiershipScottish FootballFootballMore on this storyVisit our Aberdeen page for all the latest news, analysis and fan viewsGet Aberdeen news notifications in the BBC Sport appPublished18 June 2023",

Everyone needs clarity and a reliable answer' - IsmaelRovers were ordered to replay the fixture against Ipswich - a decision that Ismael labelled \"disgraceful\" - with the game resulting in a 1-1 draw when it eventually took place last week.When asked whether it was the right call for referee Ruebyn Ricardo to bring Saturday's game with the Owls to a halt, Ismael said it was \"embarrassing\" that the same situation had happened again.\"I want to have a guarantee that I can do my job properly. The players need the guarantee that I can do the job properly,\" he continued.\"The fans, when they pay to see a game, they want to see 90 minutes in full and not have to go back home with a big big frustration.\"The next step is not my job to explain that. Someone else [has] to stand up and show up and to explain to people why it's happened again.\"It's a terrible situation, an embarrassing situation and not a nice situation to have. We've got enough issues this season.\"Blackburn are due to play Oxford United at home on Tuesday. However, the forecast makes for grim reading, with a yellow Met Office weather warning in place due to the effects of Storm Bran, which is due to strike on Tuesday into Wednesday.\"Tomorrow, if you see the forecast, the weather won't be nice, so we don't know,\" Ismael said.\"It's terrible to have that pressure on your mind to see that it's your home game, it's a rainy day and everything can happen.\"It's more the long term we have to think about because everyone needs clarity. The players, the staff, the fans, the EFL, everyone needs to have a reliable answer so that we can make sure that this embarrassing situation cannot carry on.\"Listen to more content on Blackburn Rovers on BBC Sounds.Related topicsBlackburn RoversChampionshipFootballMore on this storyLatest Blackburn Rovers news, analysis and fan viewsListen to Blackburn Rovers content on BBC Sounds",

    "description": "Brazil forward Neymar Jr will undergo surgery on a knee injury after playing through pain to help Santos avoid relegation from his nation's top division.",
    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Neymar Jr made his Brazil debut in 2010 and has scored 79 goals in 128 appearances for his countyByTim VickerySouth American football expertPublished8 December 2025Neymar is set to have knee surgery after playing in pain to help boyhood club Santos avoid relegation from Brazil's Serie A.The 33-year-old played the full 90 minutes as Santos claimed a 3-0 win over Cruzeiro on Sunday to avoid an immediate return to the second tier after promotion last season.He did not give any any details on his expected recovery, adding: \"I need to rest and then I will have this knee surgery.\"Neymar returned to Brazil in January after making just seven appearances over 18 months for Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal. He has played a crucial role in Santos' survival by scoring five goals in their last four matches of the season.\"I came for this, to try to help in the best way I can,\" said Neymar. \"These have been tough weeks for me.\"I thank those who were with me to lift me up. If it weren't for them, I wouldn't have played these matches because of this knee problem.\"Injuries have limited Brazil's all-time top scorer, who has netted 79 goals in 128 appearances, from featuring for the national side since a defeat by Uruguay in October 2023.In October this year, Brazil head coach Carlo Ancelotti said the forward must regain full fitness and be in form to be recalled to his squad for next summer's World Cup in Canada, Mexico and the United States.'He has enough time to put himself in the conversation'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Neymar scored five goals and registered one assist in Santos' last five gamesTwo weeks ago Neymar's hopes of having one last crack at the World Cup looked like a forlorn dream.The return to Santos had emphatically not lived up to expectations and the serious knee injury he suffered playing for Brazil in October 2023 was taking its toll. Neymar spent the year repeatedly breaking down with niggling injuries. Unable to build up any rhythm, he looked a shadow of his former self; he could still strike a dead ball or see a pass, but he was unable to get away from his marker and glide past defenders.Santos were deep in relegation trouble, and Neymar cut a frustrated, petulant figure, at war with everyone around him - opponents, referees, even his own team-mates.His name would come up in every Brazil news conference - but this was a bomb that coach Carlo Ancelotti found easy to defuse, using general statements about the need to take only fully fit players to the USA.The past 10 days might have saved Neymar's World Cup. They have certainly shaken things up.It looked as if his year might be over. He needs a minor knee operation. But, heavily strapped up, he took to the field and was the driving force behind three consecutive wins that carried Santos to safety- and even in to next year's version of the Europa League equivalent.There was a goal and an assist in the 3-0 win over Sport, a hat-trick in the 3-0 win away to Juventude, and no goals but a fine contribution in the clinching 3-0 win over Cruzeiro. Neymar had saved the best of the season until last.A huge 'but' applies here. The fixture list could not have been easier. Sport and Juventude had already been relegated. Cruzeiro, in midweek cup semi-final action, fielded the reserves. These games have next to nothing to do with the World Cup.But they have changed the scenario. Had Santos gone down, things looked bleak. Playing himself into the Brazil squad would have been impossible from the second division, and options of finding another club would have been limited.Now, this changes. It is not certain that he will stay at Santos. His contract runs out at the end of the month, and many at the club are concerned that they cannot afford him. The probability now is that he will stay, for six months at least - and if not, the past few days have surely proved enough for another Brazilian club to offer him a short-term deal.And with the first division kicking off at the end of January - two months earlier than usual - if he can come back flying from minor knee surgery then he has enough time to put himself in the conversation.As Ancelotti said last Friday when pressed on the subject once more, we are in December and the World Cup is not until June. It all depends, then, on what Neymar does with the next few months.Related topicsFootballMore on this storyFollow your club with BBC SportPublished17 OctoberListen to the latest Football Daily podcastGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 August",

    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Jesse Marsch (right) received one of eight bookings dished out during Canada's 1-0 friendly win over Wales in SeptemberByDafydd PritchardBBC Sport WalesPublished8 December 2025Wales head coach Craig Bellamy is looking forward to renewing his rivalry with Canada counterpart Jesse Marsch if he can lead his team to the World Cup.If Wales win their play-off semi-final and final in March, they will be in Group B alongside co-hosts Canada, as well as Switzerland and Qatar at next summer's tournament in North America.The opening fixture between Canada and Wales in Toronto will be a grudge match of sorts, after an ill-tempered finish to their friendly in September.Bellamy was unhappy with the way former Leeds United boss Marsch and his coaches celebrated their 1-0 win before the final whistle in Swansea, while the Canadian players and their manager were exuberant in their celebrations afterwards.Bellamy said after the game, \"I hope I see you [Marsch and Canada] at the World Cup\" and, following Friday's extravagant, long-winded draw in Washington DC, he could have his wish next June.\"I watched a little bit of the World Cup draw but not much. I think I got lost after the first 20 minutes and I think I came back to it about five hours later,\" the former Liverpool and Manchester City forward joked.\"I always have that on my mind. Just get there first. We've got to get there first but, if that is the case, then we [Marsch and Bellamy] will definitely have a nice conversation before that as well.\"I've got nothing against that guy, by the way, I think he's got something against the world. There's a part of me that really likes him from afar without really knowing him.\"But some of the things he says, you see his interviews before the other games after playing us... I think I find him very interesting.\"Kind draw with an edge? Wales' potential World Cup groupPublished3 days ago'World Cup could earn millions for Welsh grassroots'Published4 days agoAsked about the nature of the Canadian celebrations, Bellamy added: \"All those wind me up, I've got to be honest, they all do. Be respectful.\"It's maybe more for TikTok or Instagram. I'm not a dinosaur, trust me. I'm not old-fashioned but there's a level of respect.\"Marsch did his bit to stoke the fires of this unlikely feud during an interview in October.\"After we beat Wales, [Bellamy] made up some ridiculousness about how we were celebrating because he was trying to take away from the fact that they lost to Canada,\" the former United States international said.\"The point is, this is a different Canada. This is a talented Canada. This is a team that doesn't fear anyone.\"Before that rematch becomes reality, Wales must successfully navigate the play-offs - as they did to qualify for the 2022 World Cup.Bellamy's side host Bosnia-Herzegovina in their play-off semi-final on 26 March and, if victorious, will face Italy or Northern Ireland in Cardiff five days later with a World Cup spot on the line.\"You don't want to get too far ahead. You can't, so focus everything towards that,\" said Bellamy. \"My whole psyche goes back to Bosnia. Bosnia is the most important. If we don't, it's done.\"I'll watch Northern Ireland games, watch Italy games as well. So it'll be mainly Bosnia but there will be a gameplan for Northern Ireland, there will be a gameplan for Italy as well because of the turnaround.\"The simple fact is, whether we win or lose, we're going to play the other one anyway [the losers of each play-off semi-final will play each other in a friendly].\"So it's part of the turnaround, to be able to work with the intensity we want to have, we have to be watching the other two teams as well.\"Related topicsWales Men's Football TeamCanadaFootball",

    "description": "LIV Golf are optimistic that the tour will secure official world golf ranking points for players in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Scott O'Neil replaced Greg Norman as LIV Golf's chief executive in 2025ByStephen WatsonBBC Sport NIPublished8 December 2025LIV Golf chief executive Scott O'Neil is optimistic the tour will secure official world golf ranking points for players in 2026.The breakaway tour, which launched in 2022, has been locked out of the OWGR because of its 54-hole, no-cut, closed-field model, but they believe gaining ranking points would be transformative. It would automatically enable more LIV players to qualify for majors and remove one of the biggest remaining barriers between the league and the established golf ecosystem.O'Neil has described ongoing talks with OWGR as encouraging.\"We are working very closely with [chairman] Trevor Immelman and the board of OWGR,\" O'Neil, who replaced Greg Norman as LIV chief executive at the start of 2025, told BBC Sport NI. \"It's likely that will have an impact at some point. We are having conversations with Trevor, who is doing an extraordinary and difficult job towards a solution that we hope to have in place by next season. \"There are a whole host of things we are talking through.\"'150th Open champion Smith needs more than a cool number plate'Published6 days agoCanter turns down PGA Tour and rejoins LIV GolfPublished1 DecemberStenson plans to return to DP World Tour from LIVPublished18 NovemberThe headline change which is set to help facilitate the rankings shift is the move from 54 to the more traditional 72-hole tournaments. Whether this a concession or a calculated step toward legitimacy on its own terms remains to be seen, but O'Neil says the decision is also driven by commercial reality.There are sponsors and broadcast partners who want more television air-time, while he believes the extra day of play will also create space for the concerts, DJs and fan experiences that have become a significant part of LIV events.\"Whatever we have to do to get more people invested in this great game, we'll do it,\" added O'Neil.Despite the format change, the LIV name - which is 54 in Roman numerals - will remain. \"LIV is a brand,\" O'Neil added, pointing out that the Roman numeral 54 originally symbolised a round of golf featuring a birdie on every one of the 18 holes, as much as the total number of holes in a tournament or players in the field. The identity of the brand, he believes, has outgrown the number.Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Two-time major winner Jon Rahm is one of the most prominent players to make the switch to LIV GolfO'Neil, who has more than 25 years experience managing global sports and entertainment brands, laid out a vision for LIV Golf that is in equal parts defiant and conciliatory.His immediate priority is the league's growth and global expansion, not reuniting men's professional golf. There is pragmatic openness to working with the rest of the sport, but seemingly without any desperation to force the full merger which was agreed by the PGA Tour, LIV and DP World Tour in 2023.Negotiations are still ongoing two and a half years later despite an intervention by US President Donald Trump, but O'Neil argues that different leagues with different aims can co-exist and occasionally collaborate.\"The PGA Tour is a US-focused tour and they do an incredible job. I would say we're a global tour,\" said ONeil, who previously worked in the NBA & NHL.\"It's very akin to Formula One and Indy Car. Indy Car is a wonder. I went to the Indianapolis 500 and it's an incredible experience and event.\"Formula One is different, though. It is a cultural experience. You have fashion, art, music and sport and world-class hospitality. It's in all the most important cities in the world and I think that's much more who we are and what we're about.\"On the explosive question of reunification with the PGA Tour, O'Neil's tone is measured but unambiguous. He says conversations with newly-appointed PGA Tour chief executive Brian Rolapp have only been preliminary and both have been focused on getting their own organisations in place.\"Yes I think we will need to create more playing experiences and opportunities with the PGA Tour,\" continued O'Neil.\"I think there's real opportunity, but I am focused on LIV Golf and taking the sport around the world. I think that we are all smart enough to figure out that we can also create bigger platforms to have some fun and grow this game together.\"I would say that if I were here for three years, I'd be thinking very differently. I think today what I'm looking at is a business with a strong foundation and incredible momentum and happy players, happy caddies and happy families of players.\"The players want to be here and I think that part is pretty special, but are there opportunities to come together? Of course and if there are prudent ones that make sense for LIV we'll do them.\"Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Rory McIlroy said last month that LIV Golf had spent \"irrationally\" on player contractsFive-time major winner and PGA Tour player Rory McIlroy last month criticised LIV Golf's \"irrational spending\" on huge player contracts saying that it makes a merger very difficult, and that LIV would have to keep spending to maintain its position.O'Neil does not want to be drawn into a war of words with LIV's most outspoken critic.\"Rory has had an extraordinary career and is an extraordinary player,\" said O'Neil.\"I've met him a couple of times, but I don't know him so don't really want to comment. All I will say is I am working every day to create the greatest sports league in the world. \"We have players who are committed and our players commit to a different level of travel.\"When pushed on whether there would be further significant spending on player contracts O'Neil said: \"I only have an 11-month view. I wasn't here when they had to do what they had to do to set LIV up, I wasn't here when some of the madness in the ecosystem was happening.\"I only know from the first day of January when I showed up, I have hired a business team that I would argue is second to none in terms of commercial acumen. So I like what we do and how we do it.\"I feel like there's a good opportunity to have plenty of growth in markets like Australia, Korea, the UK, North America, South Africa, Mexico, Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore. I know I am in the market. There are golf fans everywhere.\"Related topicsGolfNorthern Ireland Sport",

France international try-scoring machines Damian Penaud and World Player of the Year nominee Louis Bielle-Biarrey both got on the scoresheet and any side with those two on the wings has a chance of beating whoever is put in front of them.Impressive Bath can go distanceBath's sole success in this competition came almost 30 years ago but throughout the ensuing period they have probably never been better equipped to add a second star to the jersey.The defending English Prem champions are top of the pile domestically after six games and will be aiming to translate that form into Europe - especially after suffering a surprise group-stage exit last year.Johann van Graan's men looked a very complete and composed outfit in the 40-14 win over Munster, who are third in the United Rugby Championship, on Saturday night.They combine attacking verve - sealing the bonus point inside 20 minutes at the Rec - with defensive steel, holding their visitors at arm's length when they threatened a dramatic comeback.With Finn Russell and Ben Spencer in the half-backs and strength in depth across the squad they have to be considered serious contenders for a first European trophy since 1998.Bath's key result in the pools last season came in the second round, an agonising 22-21 loss at Benetton with a rotated team.Now with a Prem title under their belt and leading domestically again, Van Graan may feel able to put a heightened focus on the Champions Cup this year.Did the Champions Cup opening weekend deliver?Bath see off Munster for impressive bonus-point winPublished2 days agoGlasgow put Sale on the back footImage source, ShutterstockImage caption, Stafford McDowall scored a try on his 100th appearance for GlasgowThere are strong teams everywhere you look in the Champions Cup but Pool One looks set to be one of the most fiercely contested.In the tournament's current format a lot is made about winning your home games, which is why Glasgow's away victory at Sale on Friday evening might just prove crucial.The Scottish side were 14-0 down after 20 minutes but came back strongly and two tries early in the second half gave them a precious five points.In doing so, they gave their chances of progressing a significant early boost and conversely dealt a hefty blow to Sale.With Toulouse - imperious 56-19 winners against the Sharks - and Saracens, who brushed aside Clermont, also in the pool, we should be in for plenty of fireworks.And what of Glasgow's old rivals Edinburgh?

Runners-up three years in a row between 2022-24 they looked heavy favourites last season after following up a 62-0 mauling of Harlequins in the last 16 with a 52-0 demolition of Glasgow in the quarter-final.It was hoped that New Zealand full-back Jordie Barrett would be the missing ingredient to take them over the line, but they were ambushed and suffered a shock loss to Northampton Saints in the semi. This year they are trying the All Black experiment again, this time with Rieko Ioane, who claimed a try assist on his debut in Saturday's 45-28 win over Harlequins.Is Ioane the man to bring the trophy back to Ireland for the first time since 2018?Leinster finish strongly to hold off HarlequinsPublished2 days agoStormers ready to step upSince the South African sides joined the Champions Cup in 2022-23 the furthest any of their teams have got is the quarter-finals and last year none of them managed to make it out of the group stage, with plenty of weakened teams fielded.Is this the year that changes? The Stormers are top of the URC and started their European campaign off with a 26-17 away win at Bayonne on Friday.The post-match comments were encouraging too, with players and coaches speaking of their ambition, and the likes of Springboks Cobus Reinach, Sacha Feinberg-Mngomezulu and Damian Willemse not involved in the round-one win.The Stormers look the best bet for a South African side to go deep into the tournament, although don't count out the Sharks and Bulls, who both lost this weekend but did play Toulouse and Bordeaux respectively.Saints and Pau serve up a classicImage source, ShutterstockImage caption, Northampton Saints against Pau was one of the most entertaining matches of the opening roundThere were a few contenders for game of the weekend and this one was right up there.Pau have been enjoying a brilliant season, led by Pumas Julian Montoya and Facundo Isa and former Wasps scrum-half Dan Robson. They are currently second in the Top 14 and the atmosphere was electric at the Stade du Hameau for their first Champions Cup game in 25 years.Both sides played some superb rugby to make for an absorbing contest which remained level until the closing stages, when George Hendy scored the winning try to give last year's finalists a five-point victory.But as a relative unknown to many fans watching at home, Pau certainly announced themselves on the big stage and no-one will fancy facing them at home, where they hadn't lost this season before this weekend.As Saints and England scrum-half Alex Mitchell said after the game: \"Pau are one hell of an outfit.\"Northampton are unfancied by many but after this impressive win on the road, in which they fought back after a 20-minute card, the Saints have made a statement.Hendy settles absorbing contest as Saints beat PauPublished1 day agoScarlets come close on European returnThere was no Welsh representation at all in last year's Champions Cup so the return of Scarlets to the competition is one to be welcomed by rugby fans.With Wales' struggles internationally and uncertainty over the future of the domestic scene the Scarlets almost pulled off a confidence-boosting win against Bristol Bears.As it was they were edged out by one point with Wales international Louis Rees-Zammit's try proving the difference.Building on a promising performance will be the next task but it doesn't get any easier - with defending champions Bordeaux next up.

    "description": "After Mohamed Salah's extraordinary interview about his Liverpool future, we have looked at some of the other big Premier League outbursts",
    "fullText": "Media caption, Rooney: \"Disrespectful\" Salah comments \"threw Liverpool under the bus\"ByDale JohnsonFootball issues correspondentPublished8 December 2025284 CommentsThere have been some iconic rants and outbursts - from both managers and players - throughout the history of the Premier League. Some of them were measured and planned, others came in moments of frustration. And then every now and again there was just plain anger. Mohamed Salah, for instance, deliberately picked his moment on Saturday to say he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool. But it is not always so calculated. Everyone knows about Kevin Keegan's \"I would love it\" remark from the 1995-96 season. BBC Sport have picked out 10 other incidents that have helped to define the Premier League, and looked at what happened next.Mohamed Salah... againIf Salah stops to speak to the media, it is usually for a good reason.After a 3-2 win at Southampton in November 2024, Salah dropped the bombshell that he was \"probably more out than in\" with regards to his Anfield future.The Egypt international had moved into the final year of his Liverpool contract and at that stage, looked unlikely to sign a new deal despite a desire to stay put. There had also been speculation about a potential move to the Saudi Pro League and Salah felt the need to set the record straight.Salah's comments ramped up the pressure on the Liverpool hierarchy as his goals propelled the club towards the Premier League title. According to Opta, Salah's goals and assists had been worth 17 points to Liverpool at that point - the most of any player in the division. What happened next: It took another five months, but Salah did eventually sign a new two-year deal in April.He has not been able to live up to his previous hot form, with five goals and three assists across 18 appearances this season. The fans were clearly going to be on his side last term, that unequivocal support might not be there this time. Salah in Liverpool training but not expected to travel for Inter game Published15 hours agoIs there any way back for Salah and Liverpool?Published1 day agoSalah is destroying his legacy - RooneyPublished1 day agoKeane criticises team-mates in MUTV interviewImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Sir Alex Ferguson wasted no time in showing Roy Keane the doorIt was 29 October, 2005, and Manchester United had just been thrashed 4-1 by Middlesbrough at the Riverside. After the game MUTV, the club's in-house television channel, spoke to an injured Roy Keane for a segment in which he would analyse the match. And what came next was classic Roy Keane. The captain criticised most of his team-mates in the interview. Rio Ferdinand, Darren Fletcher, Edwin van der Sar, Alan Smith, John O'Shea and Kieran Richardson in particular were singled out.Yet this interview has never been seen, because Sir Alex Ferguson ordered that it must not be broadcast and the tape destroyed. What happened next: Keane's glittering 12-year career at Old Trafford abruptly ended as his contract was mutually ripped up on 18 November, 2005.He joined Celtic as a free agent when the January transfer window opened. Rafa gets his facts straight\"I want to talk about facts,\" Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez famously said in January 2009.It was the beginning of a long and planned speech about Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson.Reading from a piece of paper, Benitez hit out at Ferguson for his treatment of referees, and for his complaints about the fixture list. The bizarre part was the random nature of it, delivered during the pre-match press conference before a game against Stoke City. Liverpool were not due to play Manchester United until March.Benitez said he did not \"want to play mind games too early,\" but it seemed like Ferguson had already won that battle.What happened next: Liverpool's form nosedived, first drawing 0-0 at Stoke. They drew four games in a row, and won three of the next 10. They dropped 11 Premier League points during this period. Come May, Manchester United would win the title with Liverpool four points behind in second. Chelsea claim Gallas threatened to score an own goalTransfers from Chelsea to Arsenal have become commonplace in recent years. Noni Madueke, Kepa Arrizabalaga, Kai Havertz and Jorginho being just four examples.But back in 2006 this very much was not the case. No senior player had moved between the clubs for 23 years. Then came the explosive transfer which saw Ashley Cole move to Stamford Bridge, with William Gallas going in the opposite direction.A few days after the deal was done, Chelsea released an incredible statement on their official website outlining a number of complaints about Gallas' behaviour and refusal to play games. Chelsea claimed that Gallas had threatened to \"score an own goal or get himself sent off\" if he had to play in the opening match of the 2006-07 season against Manchester City.What happened next: While Gallas admitted he had asked to leave Chelsea, he denied he had ever threatened to deliberately score an own goal. Gallas had just won back-to-back Premier League titles under Jose Mourinho, but he didn't win a single trophy in four years at Arsenal. In that time Chelsea won the Premier League, three FA Cups and the League Cup. Rooney wants out of Manchester UnitedWayne Rooney said in his latest podcast episode that Salah was \"destroying his legacy at Liverpool\" with the Egyptian now fighting for his Anfield future.Rooney has been there himself - but has proved there can be a way back. It was October 2010 when Sir Alex Ferguson said in a press conference that Rooney had asked to leave the club.Then, hours before a Champions League game against Bursaspor, the striker issued his own statement. Rooney said he had not received assurances \"about the continued ability of the club to attract the top players in the world.\"What happened next: In a miraculous u-turn, two days later Rooney signed a new five-year contract at Old Trafford.Rooney asked to leave the club again in May 2013, handing in a transfer request. But he eventually signed another new deal and stayed until 2017.Ronaldo accuses Man Utd of betrayalImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Cristiano Ronaldo joined Al Nassr in Saudi Arabia after a breakdown in his relationship with Erik ten HagFor Salah in 2025, read Cristiano Ronaldo in 2022.Ronaldo had returned to Manchester United to much fanfare in August 2021, scoring twice on his second debut in a 4-1 win over Newcastle United.Gradually, it turned sour for the Portuguese and on 14 November, 2022 he gave an interview where he said he felt \"betrayed\" and that \"fans should know the truth.\"On manager Erik ten Hag, he added: \"I don't have respect for him because he doesn't show respect for me.\"What happened next: Ronaldo had played his last game for the club. He jetted off to the World Cup in Qatar with Portugal. On 22 November it was announced that his contract had been ended by mutual agreement. Sterling says he wants to leave Liverpool to win trophiesImage source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Raheem Sterling's relationship with the fans deteriorated over the final two months of the seasonRejecting a contract is one thing, how you go about it is a whole different ball game. Sterling was only 20 when he told the BBC in April 2015 that he was stalling on signing a new Liverpool contract with remarks which suggested he could win more trophies elsewhere. A deal worth £100,000-a-week was on the table, and the forward insisted it was \"not about the money at all.\" Although he had not expressed that he wanted to quit the club, it was not hard to read between the lines. Liverpool fans didn't buy it. A few weeks later reports emerged that he had asked to leave. It led to a frosty final few weeks of the season with the supporters. What happened next: Sterling joined Manchester City in July for an initial £44m.He got the trophies he desired, winning four Premier League titles, the FA Cup and five League Cups. Sterling has been jeered every time he's played against Liverpool.Pearson's ostrich momentAfter seven Premier League games without a victory, Leicester City had won four in a row in April 2015. That was before they came right back down to earth with a bump having lost 3-1 at home to Chelsea. It left them a point above the relegation places and manager Nigel Pearson hit out at the press.Pearson was attempting to pull off an unlikely escape from relegation. But he felt that some negative comments about his players were not helpful to their cause.\"If you don't know the answer to that question then I think you are an ostrich,\" Pearson told reporter Ian Baker. \"Your head must be in the sand.\"Pearson went on to mimic the reporter as he grew increasingly frustrated during the exchange. He would later publicly apologise for the outburst.What happened next: Leicester won three of their last four matches and ended up being six points clear of the bottom three at the end of the season.But Pearson had a fractious relationship with Leicester's owners and he was sacked in the summer.It worked out well for the Foxes, though. They appointed Claudio Ranieri and shocked the football world by winning the Premier League in 2015-16.Kinnear's expletive-laden rantWhen Joe Kinnear returned to management with Newcastle in 2008 it was an appointment that came out of nowhere. Kinnear had been out of work for nearly four years after leaving Nottingham Forest in 2004. Newcastle opted for the former Wimbledon boss as an interim manager after Kevin Keegan's departure. Kinnear had only been in charge for two weeks when he laid into Daily Mirror journalist Simon Bird in a press conference. He felt he had been misrepresented in newspaper reports. The rant lasted five minutes and included over 50 swear words, of many different varieties.What happened next: Kinnear's interim stint was eventually made permanent, but he had to leave the club in February 2009 after requiring a heart bypass operation.He was not finished with Newcastle and was back as director football in June 2013. Eight months later he was gone again.Austin rages against officials, calls for VARIn November 2018, Southampton striker Charlie Austin lost his cool in a post-match interview after he had seen a goal ruled out for offside. Southampton went on to draw 1-1 with Watford, so the decision was crucial.There was no VAR in the Premier League at this point. \"The officials cost us two points,\" Austin said. \"They said it was offside, that is a joke.\"People go on about VAR, they clearly need help. If this is the best, most-watched league in the world then give them all the help they need. It is a joke.\"What happened next: VAR was introduced at the start of the 2019-20 season, and the same old arguments still rage. These days, the ire is directly towards the video official.Related topicsManchester UnitedLeicester CityLiverpoolChelseaPremier LeagueNewcastle UnitedFootballGet news, insight and fan views on your Premier League teamPublished17 OctoberAll your football quizzes in one placeMore on this storyPremier League indexPremier League tablePremier League fixtures",

    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Brendon McCullum's England team are winless in their past four TestsByStephan ShemiltChief cricket reporter in BrisbanePublished8 December 2025751 CommentsEngland will have \"no chance\" of recovering in the Ashes series if they play with a \"glass jaw\", says head coach Brendon McCullum. The tourists are 2-0 down with three to play after defeat in the second Test in Brisbane. England have never come back from that deficit to win an Ashes series.Following the loss at the Gabba, captain Ben Stokes said his dressing room is \"no place for weak men\".Asked if he agreed with Stokes, McCullum replied: \"100%. It's no different to the language I've been using. You don't get to feel sorry for yourself in these jobs.\"This is not a country where you can expect to be anything other than fully committed to what you're doing.\"England are on the verge of surrendering the series at the earliest possible opportunity after losing the first two Tests in fewer than six days of cricket.In the first Test in Perth, the tourists were bowled out for 172 and 164, including collapses of seven wickets for 78 runs and 9-99. In the second innings in Perth, England lost 6-80.\"Ultimately, you can't afford to flinch when you come down here,\" said McCullum.\"This is not a country to start doubting yourself or to walk away from the challenge. \"You come to this country and have a glass jaw, you have no chance. You have to be strong, tough, and you have to get on with it.\"The loss in Brisbane extended England's winless run in Australia to 17 matches, including 15 defeats, dating back to 2011.Stokes' team must be victorious in all three of the remaining Tests, beginning in Adelaide on 17 December (23:30 GMT, 16 December), if they are to win the urn for the first time since 2015.England will spend part of the gap between Tests on a break in the resort town of Noosa, on the Sunshine Coast. They will then train for three days in the run-up to the match in Adelaide.Decisions around preparation and tour games have come under scrutiny on the tour. England played only one match, against England Lions, before the series began, then opted to send none of the players from the first Test to a Lions game against the Prime Minister's XI in the run-up to the second Test.'England in battle to avoid worst Ashes tour in modern times'Published1 day agoEngland's 'Bazball' message dead - Agnew columnPublished22 hours agoThe visitors instead trained for five days in Brisbane, which McCullum said was \"too much\". The New Zealander now feels it is right for his team to \"freshen up\".\"A few days away wouldn't be the worst thing,\" he said. \"I'm a horse-racing man and in the horse-racing game you wouldn't keep doing the same thing with your horse if it's struggling a bit.\"Separately, it is understood the England and Wales Cricket Board will approach Cricket Australia over an arrangement covering the 2027 Ashes in the UK and the 2029-30 series in Australia.The approach would involve an agreement between the two boards to lay on the highest possible standard of warm-up facility and opposition to help ensure an entertaining, competitive Test series.McCullum admitted he was open to the possibility of making changes to the England team for Adelaide when he said: \"Over a five-Test series you'll need a majority of your squad.\"Two players that would come under scrutiny are batter Ollie Pope and Jamie Smith, but both received backing from the coach.On Smith, McCullum said: \"He's a flair player and he likes to approach the game in a simple way.\"He works very hard on his game but he also has the courage and conviction when he feels he's given himself the best chance. It doesn't guarantee everything but I'm sure he'll appreciate the conditions in Adelaide with the boundary sizes and the pitch.\"Asked about Pope, McCullum added: \"Popey has been number three. He's done well. He's averaged 40-odd for us. He's our number three here in Australia.\"I've stressed that we have the squad that we've got. There's no sense looking elsewhere. We're confident in everyone and that hasn't changed. We've just got to find ways to go to get ourselves back into this contest.\"Related topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamThe AshesCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished16 August",

    "description": "Wolves have had a nightmare start to the Premier League season but can they avoid Derby's unwanted record?",
    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Wolves have been in the Premier League since promotion in 2018ByNick MashiterFootball reporterPublished8 December 2025692 CommentsIt has been 227 days, three managers, two sporting directors, one technical director and 41 goals conceded since Wolves last won in the Premier League. Rooted to the bottom with just two points and 13 away from safety, their top flight future looks bleak as they are already guaranteed to be bottom of the table on Christmas Day.Monday's 4-1 loss at home to Manchester United was their eighth-straight league defeat, their longest losing top flight run in the Premier League era and equalling their all-time top flight run of defeats from 1981-82.Jean-Ricner Bellegarde's first-half equaliser was just their first league goal since 26 October. Wolves' haul of only two points this season is the joint-lowest tally after 15 games of a campaign in the history of the top four tiers.Angry Wolves fans boycotted the opening 15 minutes against United to protest against Fosun's running of the club - they might have wished they stayed outside.\"I understand the frustration,\" said manager Rob Edwards. \"I won't tell fans what to do. \"I'd love them to support the players but they have to see effort and commitment in return. Mistakes were punished tonight and that filtered through. There was an anger in the stadium. The lads are trying. The supporters are angry and I get it.\"It's the toughest league in the world and we came into a team who hadn't won since April. I wasn't anticipating a quick turnaround.\"Relegation to the Championship is becoming almost an inevitability with Derby County's Premier League low of 11 points under serious threat, so will Wolves avoid becoming the worst team? How did they get here?It's important to distinguish this is a completely different Premier League era to Derby's, so the comparisons may feel unfair. It is not a problem purely based on this season either. Since successive seventh placed finishes in 2018-19 and 2019-20 Wolves have slowly slipped down the table.In the past five seasons they have finished 13th, 10th, 13th, 14th and 16th, having needed to replace the manager at least twice to save themselves.Edwards is the fifth head coach in four years and third in less than 12 months after Gary O'Neil and Vitor Pereira's sackings. The revolving door of managers has coincided with major changes in the squad as Wolves have sold and failed to replace their star players.Raul Jimenez, Ruben Neves, Adama Traore, Pedro Neto, Max Kilman, Conor Coady and Joao Moutinho were all crucial to success under Nuno Espirito Santo and reaching the Europa League quarter-finals in 2020. The summer exits of Nelson Semedo, Rayan Ait-Nouri and Matheus Cunha are also still being felt. The five who arrived in the summer, excluding Jorgen Strand Larsen after he made his loan from Celta Vigo permanent, had no Premier League experience and are taking too long to adapt. Edwards has already admitted they need more know-how, which will be an aim in January - although who they are able to sign will largely depend on how far adrift they have fallen.There have been concerns about the squad's ability to gel given the number of nationalities and their fitness levels, with boss Edwards eager to get them to the levels he wants to play with his levels of intensity. The Derby side of 2007-08 had six points at this stage of the season and striker Robert Earnshaw, part of the Rams' squad, knows how badly it can go wrong.He told BBC Sport: \"At Derby, the politics around the club disrupted what was going on in the changing room, on the pitch. It was almost as if everyone gave up, it was 20 games to go and it was like 'we're never going to do it'. There was all this negative talk.\"It was not an accident the team finished bottom and struggled for points. The club almost relegated itself. There was too much politics going on. \"You can relegate yourself based on how you think. If you come in on Monday morning it's heavier to pick yourself up and heavier to look past the results.\"\"You've sold the team, now sell the club\" is a regular chant at Molineux from the South Bank as they direct their anger at owners Fosun and executive chairman Jeff Shi. That will not change Fosun's mindset. If Wolves are relegated they will remain and there are no immediate plans to sell, though they are open to minority investment into Fosun Sports Group, having spoken to former Crystal Palace co-owner John Textor in October. Former director of player recruitment and development Matt Jackson was also promoted to technical director last month, a move met with scepticism by fans who want to see wholesale change.Even before November's sacking of Pereira, this season was viewed as a new phase for Wolves in terms of reducing the wage bill and transfer fees - while homegrown players will be targeted both in January and beyond. Can they avoid becoming the Premier League's worst team?Wolves are winless from their opening 15 league games. The all-time English record for a top-flight winless start is held by Bolton, who failed to win any of their first 22 games in 1902-03. Unsurprisingly, they finished bottom and were relegated from the First Division.Sheffield United's Premier League record of 17 winless games is also under threat. Wolves will have to beat either Arsenal or Brentford to avoid equalling it before ending the year with trips to Liverpool and Old Trafford. The record for the lowest points tally ever recorded at Christmas in the Premier League belongs to the Blades who had two points in 2020, though that was after 14 games following the pandemic delayed the start to the season. Sunderland hold the record low for a season which started in August with five points from 17 games. West Brom were bottom at Christmas in 2004 and eight points from safety but, under Bryan Robson, became the first team to survive from that position.Earnshaw scored 11 goals in 18 starts to keep the Baggies up in that campaign, but feels Wolves are lacking the quality to make a difference. He said: \"Those moments from top players which change games, in an instant, in five or six seconds - Wolves have not got that at all. \"They can't score goals. You should be creating four or five good opportunities every half and they can't buy a goal because there's no quality there.\"They've got some very good players - Andre, Joao Gomes, Strand Larsen - but something's not quite right. Is it confidence, ability, not looking forward to the challenge? If you are dreading it as a player that's a real worry.\"Related topicsPremier LeagueFootballWolverhampton Wanderers",

Ron DeSantis on Monday designated one of the largest Muslim civil rights and advocacy groups in the U.S. a “foreign terrorist organization,” following a similar step by Texas last month.The directive against the Council on American-Islamic Relations comes in an executive order DeSantis posted on the social media site X. It also gives the same label to the Muslim Brotherhood.Neither CAIR nor the Muslim Brotherhood is designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the U.S. government.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe order instructs Florida agencies to prevent the two groups and those who have provided them material support from receiving contracts, employment and funds from a state executive or cabinet agency.In an emailed statement, CAIR and its Florida chapter said the organization plans to sue DeSantis in response to what it called an “unconstitutional” and “defamatory” proclamation.Founded in 1994, CAIR has 25 chapters around the country.CAIR last month asked a federal judge to strike down Texas Gov. Greg Abbott's proclamation, saying in a lawsuit that it was “not only contrary to the United States Constitution, but finds no support in any Texas law.”The Muslim Brotherhood was established in Egypt nearly a century ago and has branches around the world. Its leaders say it renounced violence decades ago and seeks to set up Islamic rule through elections and other peaceful means. Critics, including autocratic governments across the Middle East region, view it as a threat.About Our Ads",

We reacted in a way you can see - he's not here.\"He added: \"I don't feel my authority is undermined, it is not the way I feel it.\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation. There is always the possibility to return for a player. I have no clue [if he has played his last game for Liverpool] - I cannot answer that question at this point in time.\"'Disgraceful' Salah comments have caused 'carnage'Published8 hours agoSalah left out by Liverpool for Inter Milan game Published15 hours agoMedia caption, He's put his team-mates in jeopardy - CoadySalah said in his interview it was \"very clear that someone wants me to get all the blame\", but Slot says he does not know if that comment was aimed at him and gave his reasons for leaving Salah out for the past three games.\"It is hard for me to know who he was talking about,\" Slot said.\"That is not the way I feel. He has the right to feel the way he does, but he does not have the right to share it with the media.\"He was very respectful and has trained really hard before the weekend - to that extent it was a surprise to me the comments he gave.\"Yes, we were [on speaking terms] but it doesn't mean we were always agreeing on things.\"But it is not the first or the last time that a player who is not playing has said something similar to that.\"We as a team have struggled this season. I have tried to come up with solutions - that is my job. We tried many things and we looked very vulnerable against Nottingham Forest and PSV so I decided to play with an extra midfielder.\"Media caption, Rooney: \"Disrespectful\" Salah comments \"threw Liverpool under the bus\"Sources told BBC Sport the decision to leave Salah at home was taken with the full support of Slot, and that it is in the best interest of all parties involved for the player to have a brief period away from selection given the nature and timing of his public comments.It is understood there will be no formal disciplinary action taken by the club.Egypt forward Salah departs for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday and also looks likely to miss Liverpool's Premier League home game against Brighton on Saturday (15:00 GMT).Salah has scored 250 goals for Liverpool since signing from Roma in 2017, but has just five in 19 games this season.Slot has named a 19-man squad for Tuesday, with the Reds also missing forwards Cody Gakpo and Federico Chiesa, and defensive midfielder Wataru Endo.'I hope he plays for Liverpool again'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Alisson addresses the media at San Siro StadiumLiverpool goalkeeper Alisson says Salah's team-mates \"have different thoughts\" about his outburst, but the Brazil international wants the winger to return.\"This is not a situation that makes us happy, first and foremost because on a personal level we all love Mo,\" he said.\"We were a little bit caught by surprise but we know it is a personal situation so we are leaving it between him and the club.\"What we believe does not come into things. What we want is for him and the club to reach an agreement in the best interests of him and the club and all of the playing staff.\"I hope he plays again for the club.\"He added: \"We as his team-mates and his friends, we hope the best thing happens for him, but as Liverpool FC players we want the best for the club as well. We want a win-win situation for everyone.\"Alisson also backed his manager Slot, adding: \"We believe [in] his style of play and that he is capable of helping us to turn around this situation.\"Analysis - Slot makes it clear he is in chargeMedia caption, Arne Slot reacts to Salah commentsByAadam PatelLiverpool reporter, in MilanAlmost 48 hours after Salah spoke, this was Arne Slot's chance to say his piece.Monday was a public holiday in Milan but the media conference room inside the San Siro was still packed. It is hard to think of a more anticipated pre-match media conference in recent times.Slot used his humour to start off by joking with a reporter that he asked five questions in one, but minute by minute, details began to emerge and it was clear to see who was in charge.When BBC Sport asked him whether he understood Salah's comments when the Egyptian said he was \"thrown under the bus\", Slot said: \"Usually I'm calm, I'm polite but I'm not weak. If a player has these comments about so many things, then it's up to me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see because he's not here.\"This was Slot on the front foot and he was backed later by goalkeeper Alisson, who insisted that the Liverpool squad are firmly behind the manager who won the Premier League.That backing from a senior player was crucial on a night where Slot was asked if he felt his authority was undermined by the whole saga.Slot categorically denied he felt that way, even if he was surprised when he heard the quotes on Saturday night.The Liverpool coach did not delve too much into the specifics, insisting that his conversation with Salah was short, but he said enough to explain the situation without inflaming it any further.And, importantly, the door is still open for Salah even though Slot said he had \"no clue\" whether the 33-year-old has played his last game for the club.The club insist this was mainly because of Salah bringing his own future into question. Their position is that Salah still has a contract and as Slot said, he is a \"firm believer\" in the possibility for a player to return.After 10 minutes of questions solely focused on Salah, the Liverpool media officer, sitting next to Slot, said it was time to move on to questions about the game itself.Ultimately though, regardless of how Liverpool fare tomorrow against Inter Milan, this is a story that will continue to dominate the agenda until there is a clear resolution.Media caption, 'He's making it all about him' - Murphy on SalahRelated topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueFootballMore on this storyThe most iconic and explosive Premier League outburstsPublished15 hours agoIs there any way back for Salah and Liverpool?Published1 day agoLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Arsenal defender Leah Williamson has not played since winning Euro 2025 with EnglandByEmma SandersBBC Sport women’s football news reporterPublished8 December 2025Arsenal defender Leah Williamson is to return to action for the first time since the Euro 2025 final following a four-month absence through injury.The England captain is expected to play for \"a couple of minutes\" in Arsenal's Women's Champions League game against FC Twente on Tuesday evening, manager Renee Slegers said. Williamson was an unused substitute in Arsenal's 2-1 victory over Liverpool on Saturday.The 28-year-old has been absent since Euro 2025 – when she led the Lionesses to back-to-back titles – due to a knee injury which required a small, clean-up operation.\"She's been training with the team and was in the squad against Liverpool just to get back into her routine and it was good to have her around,\" said Slegers.\"She is doing well and did the full session again today. She is available for a couple of minutes tomorrow (Tuesday, 20:00 GMT). She won't start but she will be in the squad.\"During her absence Arsenal have struggled to find the form which guided them to the Women's Champions League title under Slegers last season.They currently sit eight points off Women's Super League leaders Manchester City and are 10th in the league phase table of the European competition with two wins from four matches.\"Of course it was unfortunate for her to sustain that injury in the Euros and she had to work hard to come back from it,\" added Slegers.\"She is in a really good place and has been spending a lot of time on the pitch. Maybe the timing of the international break extended that as there was no opportunity to train in big groups with 11 v 11 and in chaotic moments.\"But she is very ready and we will be very happy to have her back. The players who have been playing have been doing really well.\"Arsenal captain Kim Little has also recovered from a calf injury, coming off the bench in the 69th minute against Liverpool.Slegers did not rule out a start for Little against FC Twente but said the club have to be \"really smart\" in managing her return to full fitness.The return of experienced players could provide a boost to Slegers' side, who have work to do to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.Asked if confidence was low in the squad, Slegers said: \"I think that's a word we don't really talk about.

    "fullText": "Published8 December 202584 CommentsAfter every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.Here are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.Bart Verbruggen (Brighton): He made four or five really good saves and kept them in the game in the draw against West Ham. On another day West Ham go on to win that. He was bang on it and a big reason why Brighton nicked a draw.Matty Cash (Aston Villa): Wonderful goal as Aston Villa beat Arsenal and great defending. As a Birmingham fan it pains me to give him credit but he was great and Aston Villa were fantastic. Everyone feels Arsenal are going to run away with the league, but Aston Villa said \"no, not on my watch\".Marc Guehi (Crystal Palace): He got his team over the line for their win at Fulham and led by example as he always does. He got my mind thinking - not only did he play well this weekend and has been great all season, how much would Liverpool not be in this mess if they had managed to sign him? How good could Liverpool be if they had a proper centre-half like him?Marco Senesi (Bournemouth): I don't know where Bournemouth keep getting these players from. They sold two centre-halves in the summer and he has just stepped in no problem. He's been absolutely fantastic, and was again as they shut out Chelsea.Bruno Guimaraes (Newcastle): I'm putting Bruno at the base of a diamond in midfield because he is the heart, soul and spirit of Newcastle's team, and was brilliant again against Burnley. He is just a very good football player and there are not many people you can say that about.Anton Stach (Leeds): He was the player who stood out for Leeds in their draw with Liverpool. The visitors were obviously cruising but I look at players and teams in that moment and look at who is hiding. This guy turned it up - not only a notch but another 10 notches - scored a goal and got an assist.Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Everton): Is he the signing of the season? He has been fantastic. Not only is he scoring, he is pulling the strings and has become the heartbeat of this new-look Everton team under David Moyes, who can get another gear out of these players as they did against Nottingham Forest.Bruno Fernandes (Manchester United): Top of the diamond is Fernandes. Two goals at Wolves and an assist. His passing was fantastic. He loses a bit of credit because it was against arguably the worst team I have ever seen in Wolves, but he did very well. Manchester United are back on the winning trail.Xavi Simons (Tottenham): He has had a bit of a tough time at Spurs but it felt like this was his moment to show everyone why people think he is so talented. He has pace, power and glides past people. We used to call people like that a luxury but when you put in a match-winning performance like he did against Brentford, you have to start saying he is just good.Hugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Even though he is in a team that is a shambles, he gets in through the middle. He scored two goals against Leeds. I understand Liverpool spent a lot of money on Alexander Isak - and I am a huge fan - but just start this kid. Get the two of them up front and figure it out.Rayan Cherki (Manchester City) My favourite footballer to watch in world football. Not only was his assist for Phil Foden in the win against Sunderland worth the admission fee, he was just delightful. He is like the cult heroes I grew up with and makes me feel like a kid again watching football. Back in the day you had Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, JJ Okocha - a plethora of them. Now there is just Rayan Cherki - and he is fantastic.Unai Emery (Aston Villa): A massive game for Aston Villa. Against Arsenal it was that match where he gets to say: \"Remember me? You got rid of me.\" I think with all that being said, Emery is manager of the week.Do you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your team of the week? Have your say using the comments form below:Opta's players of the weekHugo EkitikeWith Liverpool and Mohamed Salah appearing to be moving in different directions - and Salah heading to join his Egypt team-mates for the Africa Cup of Nations next week anyway - the Reds need other players to step up and fill the Salah-shaped hole in the scoring charts. In Hugo Ekitike, they may have found that man.Ekitike is now Liverpool's leading Premier League scorer with five goals, while in all competitions he also tops the charts with eight. On Saturday at Elland Road, the Frenchman scored the first double of his Liverpool career, and with the goals coming in the 48th and 50th minutes, he was the first Premier League player to score twice in the opening five minutes of the second half since Raheem Sterling in March 2019 for Manchester City against Watford.He led all players in the match for shots (5), shots on target (3) and touches in the opposition box (9) and his only disappointment must have been the scoreline - he was the first Liverpool player to score two goals in a Premier League and not win since Salah last December in a 3-3 draw with Newcastle.Rayan CherkiDespite playing just 398 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player has more assists than Manchester City's Rayan Cherki (5), with two of those coming in the 3-0 victory over Sunderland.Cherki created six chances in open play, the joint most by a player in a Premier League game this season, while at 22 years and 111 days on Saturday he was the second-youngest Manchester City player to achieve that in a Premier League game, older only than - maybe surprisingly - Mario Balotelli in February 2012 against Blackburn Rovers.Among players to play 300 minutes in the Premier League, no player has created more chances per 90 minutes than Cherki (3.4) and only four have had more touches in the opposition box per 90 minutes (7.7). The Frenchman is currently assisting a goal, on average, every 80 minutes - also a league best.Bruno GuimaraesBruno Guimaraes has taken 10 corners in the Premier League this season and it is clear which one of those was most memorable - his in-swinging delivery on Saturday against Burnley caught his former team-mate Martin Dubravka out to give the Magpies the lead.It was not the first Premier League goal direct from a corner (or 'Olympico goal' as it's known) but it was Newcastle's first ever corner to be put directly into the opponent's goal in the Premier League, to give Guimaraes a slice of Magpies history. Given the term Olympico goal originates from South America, it seems apt that four of the past seven direct corner goals have been scored by players from that continent - all, in fact, from Brazil. Those scorers are Matheus Pereira, Douglas Luiz, Matheus Cunha and Guimaraes.Aside from swinging corners directly into the net, Guimaraes has been in excellent recent form - he now has four goals and two assists across his past nine Premier League appearances, scoring five in total this season. Only in 2023-24 has he ever scored more in one season, netting seven times.Related topicsFootballMore on this storyFollow your Premier League club on BBC SportPublished17 OctoberAll your football quizzes in one placeGet football news sent straight to your phonePublished16 August",

    "fullText": "ByGuillem BalagueBBC Sport columnistPublished8 December 2025Xabi Alonso's Real Madrid fate has not yet been decided but Wednesday's Champions League game against Manchester City at the Bernabeu could prove crucial.Fans are losing patience and Madrid were booed off after Sunday's 2-0 La Liga defeat by Celta Vigo, prompting an emergency meeting for the club's hierarchy to discuss Alonso's future.Real remain four points behind leaders Barcelona having won just one of their last five La Liga matches and, after a dramatic slump since beating Barcelona in October, it seems now his chances of survival are very slim.Alonso arrived at Real in the summer offering a modern approach but the club has to accept that this step is necessary. And it still resists.President Florentino Perez has never fully believed in this kind of change, even though people inside the club convinced him to appoint Rafa Benitez, Julien Lopetegui and Xabi Alonso - steps in a new direction.But the moment they falter, show doubt or the players stop buying in, Perez turns his thumb down, given that in the past the club has been more successful with less interventionist coaches like Carlo Ancelotti or Zinedine Zidane.When he arrived at Bayer Leverkusen, Alonso asked to be released if any of the clubs he had played for came calling, provided he felt like taking the job.He added one more team to that list - Manchester City, as Pep's eventual replacement. Now it could be Pep who leaves him without a job.Media caption, Nine-man Real Madrid implode in home defeat by Celta VigoMadrid's return to the Bernabeu after six games away reflected everything that has gone wrong across their run of just three wins in seven. Some good moments were there but what stood out most was the lack of connection between the manager's idea and the players' execution. They don't seem to fully believe in the plan.The scenes in the dressing room after Sunday's defeat were pure frustration - objects thrown, raised voices. Any time someone tried to blame the referee, the response was immediate: \"That's a bad excuse.\"Alonso had shouted a swear word towards Fran Garcia when he had been sent off and the manager said in the press conference that he did not like the referee's performance - but it was no excuse.The most worrying moment in his press conference after the Celta defeat was when he said certain things had been prepared - a higher tempo, pressing upfield - but the team didn't apply any of it. Echos of what previous boss Ancelotti had warned him about.The second most worrying moment was finding out the decision-makers at the club stayed behind closed doors at the Bernabeu for a few hours after the match analysing what had happened. That is never good.'If Mbappe doesn't score, nobody does'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Kylian Mbappe has scored 25 goals in 21 games for Real Madrid this seasonAlonso perhaps set himself up by announcing the return of \"rock and roll\" when he first arrived. He meant a side with a clear identity, that would press with aggression, attack with the impact of adrumbeat, and have players stepping up with the personality and sharpness of an electric guitar riff.Despite all the signs and previous warnings, Alonso didn't realise just how hard it would be to achieve the most difficult thing in football - getting everyone to think as one.He knew things would be complicated. Ancelotti had already warned him, privately and publicly, that certain ideas were prepared during the week but never applied on the pitch.Ancelotti went even further in conversations with those close to him - this was the most difficult dressing room of his career. Not because players are bad people, but because there are so many conflicting interests. Kylian Mbappe thinks about his records. Vinicius worries about not losing his authority in the team. Federico Valverde wants to play in midfield and doesn't yet have the maturity expected from a captain.On the day of the match at Liverpool, those who make the decisions at Real Madrid were openly expressing full support and admiration for what Alonso was doing - modernising the team, making it dynamic and versatile.He had just beaten Barcelona and was on a run of 13 wins in 14 matches. But after the defeat at Anfield, followed by draws away to Rayo and Elche, the pressure became relentless.Stories began to leak out that there were too many videos, that the demands were too high, that the players were expected to be robots. The typical clash between a coach with a clear methodology and players who want to rely on instinct.Problems had been accumulated.Alonso was convinced Jude Bellingham would help him as he knew English players tend to submit to the general idea. The problem has been his position. Jude is a second forward, a finisher. If used as a midfielder, he is not comfortable but will work hard to adapt. That transitional period makes for a player that doesn't give as much as he would like to. That creates frustration and doubts.Alonso would have liked Martin Zubimendi because he believes Madrid lack a midfielder who can give them rhythm and organisation. But he didn't get him and had to work with physical, dynamic midfielders who are far more comfortable with quick transitions than with positional football and short, patient passing that he also wanted to implement. Arda Guler is trying to direct the team's play but he is more of a forward than a midfielder.If Mbappe doesn't score, nobody does: Vini has now gone 11 games without a goal, Rodrygo 33.Injuries - mostly in defence - have forced Alonso to field 20 different line-ups in 21 matches.Eder Militao is Real Madrid's latest casualty and the Brazil defender is expected to be out for three to four months with a torn hamstring suffered against Vigo.'Xabi believes he is capable of finding solutions'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Xabi Alonso has a 69% win rate in La Liga this seasonPerhaps everything had already fallen apart in the reaction of Vini when he was replaced at the Clasico.It was a challenge to the authority of the manager that has not been resolved. That time the club did not protect Alonso and in the apologies Vini \"forgot\" to mention him. It was going to be very hard to come back from that.When the entire press corps turns up with the same message - Alonso's future is uncertain - it usually means that message comes from the very top and that sources from the changing room back it up. Conversations then followed those disappointing results - between the coach and the players, and between the coach and the president.The manager began making decisions partly designed to please the players, hoping they would also compromise and allow him to keep adding layers to the team's understanding — to press more, to improve their attacks against deep blocks, to control games better.The defeat by Celta on Sunday effectively ended the fans' honeymoon with Alonso, although polls show that supporters also blame the players, who they felt didn't run nearly enough. \"When they're intense and press well, it's very hard to get out,\" said Celta's coach, Claudio Giraldez, after the match. But Madrid simply aren't doing that work with conviction or consistency, a clear sign of a team that doesn't think they are going the right way.Earlier, Giraldez had also said that Real Madrid were evolving, but nobody wants to listen. Alonso believes he is capable of finding solutions. But the media are now portraying him as a coach who has been overtaken by events. Again, when that happens, it usually means the club shares that view even if it isn't actually true.At Real Madrid, you go from crisis to paradise and back to hell in one or two matches. Which is why Wednesday's is not just another game.If Alonso were to go in the next few days, don't be surprised if Real try again to bring Zidane back to the club, while former Madrid full-back and current B team manager Alvaro Arbeloa is also a contender.Related topicsEuropean FootballReal MadridFootballMore on this storyAlonso has Perez talks as Real Madrid 'struggle'Published6 days agoVinicius Jr no longer feels 'untouchable' - so what's going on?Published30 October",

    "description": "If Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum are questioning the mentality of the England players, they need to look at themselves, says Jonathan Agnew.",
    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Ben Stokes' England team were also 2-0 down in the last Ashes, then came back to draw 2-2ByJonathan AgnewBBC chief cricket commentatorPublished8 December 2025I have spoken to England captain Ben Stokes in the immediate aftermath of two defeats on this Ashes tour.The Stokes I encountered after the loss in Brisbane was completely different to the man in front of me following the defeat in Perth.It was clear he had things to say. Stokes was looking beyond the person holding the microphone and instead speaking to fans at home. There was a clear point he wanted to get across, and he did it very powerfully.To me, the Bazball message is dead. That does not mean the personnel has to change or regimes need to be swept aside – those decisions will come at the end of the series – but it means there has been a realisation by England that the way in which they play their Test cricket must be altered.The philosophy of Stokes and Brendon McCullum was necessary when they took over the England team in 2022. It was a breath of fresh air.But it was also unsustainable. It was straightforward for good teams to work out. Somewhere along the way, the rhetoric ran away from England. It got out of control and cost them matches.Now, there is a sense Stokes has observed something in the Australia team. When Stokes said his dressing room is \"not a place for weak men\", he was making a comparison to the way Australia play their cricket.There are no loose shots, there is a willingness to soak up pressure, to not leave the job to the next man.However, if Stokes and McCullum are questioning the mindset of the players, they have to look at themselves.Have England got into this situation because of a feeling of pressure or expectation to play in a certain way?When England have fallen in a heap, it is usually because of the batting. Have the players been able to bat in a way that is comfortable for them, or have they been acting out of an obligation to conform?Media caption, England soundly beaten by Australia in second Test drubbing'England in battle to avoid worst Ashes tour in modern times'Published1 day agoNo place for weak men in my dressing room - StokesPublished1 day agoIt is telling Stokes led a common-sense approach on the fourth day of the second Test, alongside Will Jacks.Remember at the beginning of his captaincy, it was Stokes who was striding to the middle, running down the pitch and clothing catches to mid-off.It was the captain showing his team how to play, saying that if he gets out in that fashion, there will be no ramifications for the rest of them.Now there is the suggestion of a reverse. In one sense, that is encouraging for the rest of this tour and the future of this England teamIt is also a clear sign that Stokes and McCullum must reflect on the messaging of the past three years.There is also the issue of the freedom of the players to question each other and the leadership. Is there space for an individual to go against the mantra?Take Harry Brook, as an example. He has got so much talent. He could score thousands and thousands of Test runs.Is anyone taking Brook to one side to discuss the drive he played at Mitchell Starc in the first innings in Brisbane? To say to Brook \"that's rubbish, you have let the team down\".If there is not the space in the England dressing room for those conversations to take place, I would say that is as much of a weakness as anything that might take place on the field.The debate will rear its head once more this week, as England spend their time between Tests on a break in Noosa.In the gap between the first two Tests, none of the XI who played in Perth went to play in the England Lions game in Canberra. I find it so hard to believe that none of the batting unit wanted a hit in the capital. Did they feel able to express that feeling?Media caption, 'A dressing room I'm captain of isn't for weak men either' - StokesListen to the full Ben Stokes interview in the TMS podcastAshes player ratings: Who may be wilting under the pressure?Published1 day agoI understand the need for England to get away from cricket on this tour, but it does not mean I believe they are making the right decision.In discussing things like planning and preparation, Stokes has often referred to the way things were done on tours of the past.The old-school method would have been to play a tour match against a Country XI - essentially a group of farmers - in a place like Port Pirie.The benefit of that would have been to give those out of form the chance to find it, and for those out of the team the opportunity to press their claims.Crucially, it would not be one-size-fits-all. If someone had done well in the Tests and felt they wanted a break, it would be permitted. If we were to use the example of Joe Root, who has just scored a hundred in Brisbane, he would go off for a break.Why can't that be the case here? I find it strange that there is a long break between Tests and the first idea is to play golf, rather than play cricket.In the same way that England need to find adaptability on the field, they have to be adaptable off it.The major concern with this regime is a need to fit in. If a player goes against the grain, they might be out. It is very difficult to lead in that manner, because not everyone is the same.Eventually, the management will be accountable for their decisions.If Brisbane is a turning point for the way England play their Test cricket, there is a way for Stokes and McCullum to remain in charge. On balance, English cricket is better off with them at the top.Now we need to see evidence of a change, rather than soundbites from Sunday evening.England have options for Adelaide, albeit not many of them.If Stokes and McCullum are asking for an altered style, do they give the same set of players the opportunity to show they can change?Do they freshen up the team? Bringing in Jacob Bethell comes with an element of risk. Jamie Smith's form worries me, but the only other wicketkeeping option is Ollie Pope.Whatever England decide, they will be aware of the magnitude of their task. To be 2-0 down with three to play in an Ashes series is incredibly serious.Stokes knows there are jobs, careers and reputations on the line. That is what he will be saying to his players.Media caption, Lack of preparation not a factor in second Test loss - McCullumRelated topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamThe AshesCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished16 August",

    "description": "Manchester United moved into the Premier League top six with their biggest win of the season - but they still have to prove the doubters wrong.",
    "fullText": "Media caption, Wolves booed as Man Utd score fourBySimon StoneManchester United reporter at MolineuxPublished7 hours ago490 CommentsIn the one step forward, one step back world Manchester United are living in just now, they took a stride in the right direction against Wolves at Molineux.Whether it is significant or not remains to be seen.After all, the big win at Crystal Palace nine days ago was followed by a dire draw against third-from-bottom West Ham. Before that, a three-match winning run was followed by three games without a win, culminating in a home defeat by an Everton side reduced to 10 men after less than 15 minutes.Monday night's 4-1 drubbing of a hapless Wolves was United's biggest win of the season, equalling a four-goal haul Ruben Amorim's side have not bettered in the Premier League since he came to the club 13 months ago. United had 27 shots, their most in a Premier League game under the Portuguese manager. They have now led in games for longer this season than they did in the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign.Yet Amorim felt compelled to add a caveat, making reference to Wolves' lack of points on the pitch and mutinous atmosphere off it.\"This is a specific case,\" he said. \"We faced a team that is really, really struggling.\"You can sense it in every situation of the game.\"This moment for Wolves is really hard, as a team and as a club. We took advantage of that.\"It is why Amorim felt United were in danger of blowing a significant chance to climb into the top six and on the coattails of the sides in contention for Champions League qualification.New Wolves boss Rob Edwards felt his side played the way he wanted in the final 15 minutes of the opening period. That included scoring their first goal in 540 minutes through Jean-Ricner Bellegarde.It wasn't the script Amorim envisaged. Certainly not one he wanted on a night when Sir Jim Ratcliffe had come to watch and was pictured in animated conversation with director of football Jason Wilcox in the directors' box.He told his players this before he left to sit in the visitors' dugout alone with his thoughts before United re-appeared for the start of the second half.\"We should have finished that half in a different way,\" he said. \"At half-time, they understood we have everything to win the game.\"If you need to be really distracted, when you look at Everton, that was three points. We could have had two more points against West Ham. Look at the table. Look at the environment. Look at everything.\"We needed to win the second half. It didn't matter the result.\"Analysing the game for Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher praised the performance but said: \"We make the assumption there is a bad result around the corner.\"He is not on his own with that opinion. United have still kept only one clean sheet in the Premier League, against Sunderland at Old Trafford on 4 October. Are they on one defeat in nine, or two wins in six?After failing to take opportunities to go second - twice - they are now sixth. If results go their way, they could be fourth once they have played Bournemouth on 15 December. Equally they could be back in the bottom half of the table.Andoni Iraola's men have taken two points from their past six games but they have won 3-0 on each of their past two visits to Old Trafford.Nothing is for certain at Manchester United these days, it seems, and that includes the availability of their players.Amorim had thought the Netherlands international Matthijs de Ligt would be available for Monday's game after missing the West Ham match with a minor injury. He was wrong. Now the manager says he can't be sure when De Ligt will be fit.United remain in talks with the respective national associations of Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon, which Amorim said is a \"good sign\" but added he \"doesn't know\" if Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo will be cleared to play against Bournemouth before they leave for Africa Cup of Nations duty.\"Let's wait for the middle of the week,\" said Amorim.Asked what moving into sixth place means, he added: \"Nothing. It's always the same feeling. We should have more points. But that's in the past, let's focus on the future.\"What information do we collect from this quiz?Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Manchester United have now been in front for longer this season than they were in the whole of last seasonMount making his markMason Mount's goal means he has now scored three times in the past four games he has started.The England star is now beginning to make the sustained impacted envisaged when he moved from Chelsea for £55m in 2023, before injuries halted his progress.It also means Amorim has options given main striker Benjamin Sesko is currently injured and Mbeumo will be leaving at some point in the near future.\"If you compare the past he had in Chelsea, he has a great quality,\" said Amorim.\"He can defend. He can attack and the quality when he touches the ball is really good.\"It's not a surprise for me. But, of course, we need to take care of him.\"But he's going to build that and is going to be really important for our club.\"Related topicsManchester UnitedFootballMore on this storyLatest Manchester United news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Man Utd - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Media caption, 'Winning made everything worth it' - Norris on F1 title and what's to come in the futureByAndrew BensonF1 Correspondent in Abu DhabiPublished8 December 2025722 CommentsLando Norris says he is looking forward to switching off and forgetting all about the year in which he achieved his lifetime's ambition of winning the Formula 1 World Championship.The McLaren driver spent Sunday night into Monday morning celebrating in Abu Dhabi, before digesting his triumph with BBC Sport in a hotel on Yas Island, a stone's throw from the F1 track.Norris is relaxed, good humoured and chatty as he reviews his journey.Next, he is heading to the McLaren factory, to analyse this year, and for work in the simulator, already thinking about next season.There are more celebrations to come this week, including picking up the official championship trophy at a prizegiving ceremony in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, on Friday, before the McLaren Christmas party in London on Saturday.And then, breathe.\"Honestly,\" Norris says, \"try to forget this season, try to forget a little bit what we've been able to achieve together. Forget that I drive in Formula 1.\"I don't want to forget what we've achieved this season, but just try to live a normal few days of the year, and go play some golf and do some normal things and that's it.\"The realisation of what he has achieved is beginning to dawn on the 26-year-old Briton but he says he \"still finds it very surreal\".\"I was just by the pool earlier,\" he says. \"And when someone says, 'Congrats, world champ' or something, it's definitely got a very different ring to it (than) when it's just 'Congrats, Lando,' or whatever it may be.\"I don't know. It's such a sizeable achievement.\"Making parents proud 'the best thing you can ask for'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris is embraced by his mum Cisca and dad Adam just after the conclusion of the Abu Dhabi Grand PrixAt the celebrations, and waiting for him in the lobby of the hotel, were his father Adam and mother Cisca. The family are wealthy, thanks to Adam Norris' success as a pension trader, which made him a multi-millionaire.But becoming an elite sportsman still means starting learning your trade at a very young age, and a lot of personal sacrifices.\"Everything is different for everyone,\" he says, \"so the sacrifices you've made are just very different sacrifices to all the people in the world have made. So I don't want anyone to feel sorry for me.\"But still as a family you want to spend time together. And that's something we've not really done a lot of since I started when I was like seven, eight years old.\"My dad was taking me everywhere. I spent a lot more time with my dad than I did with my mum. My mum was at home looking after my sisters.\"I see my mum 20 days a year maybe, something like that. Which is not a lot.\"But certainly winning and having the achievement we did yesterday made everything feel more worth it, all those times away.\"One thing that everyone wants to do, is make their parents proud. So the fact I got to do that yesterday, I hope make them even more proud, is the best thing you can ask for.\"Proving himself wrong and 'a brutal honesty'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Norris, then 15, celebrates winning the 2015 MSA Formula Championship (now known as the F4 British Championship) - 10 years before he reached the pinnacle of motorsportNorris says he's \"seen a lot of photos over the last 12 hours; a lot of little me\".One of them is of him doing donuts in a kart when he was still a small boy. What would he tell little Lando if he could talk to him now?\"Probably just to have a bit more belief in myself,\" he says, \"because it's something I never really had when I was younger. It's something I always lacked.\"In that video, I was so small. I was never the big kid or never the aggressive one, that kind of thing. I'm still the same, I think, now. I would just get my elbows out a little bit more. That's probably my only thing.\"This sort of vulnerability is Norris' trademark. It was evident after the race, too, when he said he was \"proud that I've proved myself wrong\".I ask what he meant, and he says it was a reference to his difficult first part of the season, when his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri took the initiative, and the championship lead, and had won four races before Norris had taken his second.By the time of the Dutch Grand Prix at the end of August, Piastri had a 34-point lead over Norris and seemed a certain bet for the title, only for Norris to rally and overhaul it all.\"When Oscar was doing a better job than me and I wasn't doing a great job, I was like, 'Well, you know, maybe they're just a bit better. Maybe they can just be more consistent, get more out of the car,'\" Norris says.\"I just never thought at times that it was possible. So for me to then do that for myself, to kind of go, 'You're wrong, you can do it,' is a pretty incredible feeling to have for yourself.\"I wouldn't say I'm a very selfish person, but I've also learned at times I almost have to be more selfish with some of these feelings and thoughts. I need that to almost make me a better and stronger driver.\"It's just nice to almost make myself have more confidence. But I often only do that when I prove it to myself. I've always had that thought of, 'Oh, the next step is such a big leap. Am I ever going to be able to perform at the level I need to perform at?' I have more doubts than positive thoughts at those times.\"But I've also changed a lot this season. I also feel through the year I've been able to be in a much better place, be a lot more confident in myself, change my whole approach and mentality.\"How Norris achieved his lifetime's ambition by 'winning it my way'Published1 day agoNorris is 'only just getting going' - and rank British world championsPublished18 hours agoIt's a trademark of all great F1 drivers that they look hard at themselves, analyse their weaknesses, and work out ways to improve, and keep doing it throughout their career.Norris is unusual, though, in that he speaks about that process so openly. Why?\"Great question,\" he says. \"I don't know, truthfully. I don't know why sometimes I tell you guys as much stuff as I do.\"Sometimes I get told I shouldn't and sometimes I probably do tell too much, or reveal too much, and people can see vulnerabilities in that and so forth.\"Maybe at times that's a mistake. But at the same time at least I'm being truthful to my own self. If I'm doing a bad job, I tell myself I'm doing a bad job and I certainly have people around me telling me the truth about things.\"What I hate the most is the opposite, is doing a bad job and someone going, 'That's all right, you'll be fine, things will just get better.' Because it's just not the case.\"I hate that kind of mentality and approach, and I've certainly not been brought up in that way. People around me have certainly not been like that.\"It's very much a brutal honesty which has made me the person I am today. But I'm also just I think quite an open, honest person, I will just say what I believe.\"How Monaco lap made him cry and 'flipped everything'Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Lando Norris set a new track record of 1:09.954 in taking pole position for the Monaco Grand Prix in MayNorris has achieved so much this year. Along with the world title, he has won the two races every driver dreams of winning - Monaco and his home grand prix at Silverstone.What else is there left to do? He smiles.\"I would have loved to make my life a bit easier and win it just earlier next time,\" he says. \"But I won ones that people have dreams of winning. They're some of the most incredible ones.\"The lap I did in Monaco in qualifying was the only other time probably in the last 10 years that I cried a little bit over something.\"It was the one other moment this season that I proved myself wrong, because I had that bad run of results.\"I just couldn't perform in qualifying. Qualifying has always been my strong suit, my best. It's been my strength since I was in karting. All my qualifying results are my thing and they weren't at the beginning of the season.\"I went to the hardest track to do a qualifying lap. It's not been my best track in the past.\"I turned off my (lap time cockpit display) delta for the first time that weekend so I couldn't see if I was on a better lap, worse lap, whatever it was.\"For me to then to go there and put in that lap at the end of qualifying was one of the best moments of my career, because it was the time I almost doubted myself the most ever, in the most important season that it turned out to be.\"But that one lap - one minute nine seconds - was all it needed for me to flip everything and turn that thought of 'I just don't know if I've got this' to 'I can definitely do this'. That was a pivotal moment for me up here (he points to his head).\"We end by discussing what he will take from this year into next. And he gives another revealing answer.\"I take a lot,\" he says, \"plenty of things that I know I could have done better, I should have done better.\"But I did what I had to in the end. It was crazy close. Two points is all it was to Max (Verstappen). That's pretty insane, especially when he was so far back.\"What do I take? I take that I can do it. I do have what it takes.\"I had my flaws. I had my mistakes. But I'm confident, and I have the confidence now that I can look at them, review them, analyse them, not make them again and do even better next season.\"Related topicsFormula 1More on this storyBacked by his family, propelled by his talent - the rise of NorrisPublished1 day agoInside McLaren's season - the rules, values, incidents & relationshipsPublished17 hours agoQuiz: How well do you know F1 champion Norris?Published1 day agoAbu Dhabi Grand Prix ReviewLando Norris: The Making of a World Champion",

REUTERS/Francis MascarenhasBy Munsif Vengattil and Aditya KalraBENGALURU, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Amnesty International has said India's review of a telecom industry proposal to mandate always-on satellite ​location tracking on phones for better lawful surveillance was \"deeply concerning\" and puts data ‌of human rights defenders at risk.Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has long pushed telecoms companies to give ‌more precise locations of individuals under investigation.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe telecoms operators say the best way to achieve this would be for the government to order smartphone manufacturers to permanently enable location tracking on phones. Reuters reported on Friday that the government is reviewing that proposal.The discussions are ⁠being privately opposed by big ‌smartphone firms Apple, Google and Samsung, due to privacy and security concerns.In a statement to Reuters, Amnesty International said location data can ‍be \"incredibly revealing\" and can expose personal and professional connections, such as the confidential sources who meet journalists or human rights groups.\"This is deeply concerning. At a time where surveillance scandals are a ​mushrooming global threat, states should be working on improving their practices and safeguards, not ‌forcing people to reveal yet more sensitive data,\" Amnesty said.AdvertisementAdvertisementIndia's IT and home ministries, which are reviewing the plan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday about the backlash.Amnesty has in the past denounced India's surveillance practices including alleged use of Pegasus spyware to target journalists and activists -- allegations Modi's government has repeatedly denied.A fierce ⁠privacy debate erupted in India last week after ​Reuters first reported another confidential directive from the ​government to preload a state-run cyber safety app on all smartphones. India was forced to revoke the order following outcry from activists and politicians ‍over fears of snooping.\"Why ⁠are we out to convert India into a 'Surveillance State'?\" Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said on X, criticising the proposal to track phone locations.AdvertisementAdvertisementA large ⁠number of Indian users on X joined Surjewala and other privacy activists to condemn the plan, with ‌one user framing it as turning phones into \"digital ankle monitors\".(Reporting by Munsif ‌Vengattil and Aditya KalraEditing by Peter Graff)About Our Ads",

    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mohamed Salah has scored 250 goals in 420 games for LiverpoolBySam DruryBBC Sport journalistPublished8 hours ago1160 CommentsLiverpool forward Mohamed Salah has been called a \"disgrace\" who has caused \"carnage\" at the club by pundits as the fallout continues from his explosive interview.Salah said he feels he has been \"thrown under the bus\" after being dropped to the bench for struggling Liverpool's past three games, which led to him being left out of the squad for Tuesday's Champions League match at Inter Milan.The two-time Premier League winner's remarks have led to stinging criticism from former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher and ex-Blackburn and Celtic striker Chris Sutton.\"I thought it was a disgrace,\" Carragher said on Sky Sports. \"Some have painted it as an emotional outburst. I don't think it was.\"When Mo Salah stops in the mixed zone - which he has done four times in eight years - it is choreographed with him and his agent to cause maximum damage and strengthen his own position.\"Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sutton said: \"Liverpool is carnage because of Mo Salah.\"He's been honest and open, but he's made it all about him and not the team. He's been extremely selfish - that's what he's done because now there's a bit of a civil war at Liverpool, and it didn't need to be like this.\"Liverpool manager Arne Slot said he was \"surprised\" by Salah's comments that their relationship had broken down completely and had \"no clue\" if the 33-year-old would play for the club again.\"I don't feel my authority is undermined - it is not the way I feel it,\" added Slot in Milan on Monday.\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation. There is always the possibility to return for a player.\"Egypt winger Salah will depart for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday, but with his future at Anfield in doubt it remains to be seen whether he will be involved in Saturday's Premier League home game against Brighton (15:00 GMT).Monday Night Club: ‘Selfish’ Salah, Villa join title race & Leeds revivalSalah has 'tried to throw the club under the bus'Media caption, 'He's making it all about him' - Murphy on SalahCarragher, who Salah predicted would \"go for me again\" in his interview, was particularly critical of the timing of the comments, coming after Liverpool had conceded a late equaliser to draw 3-3 at Leeds on Saturday evening.The defending Premier League champions have won just four of their past 15 games in all competitions, going back to September, with Slot increasingly finding himself under pressure.\"He has waited, I think, for a bad result with Liverpool,\" Carragher said.\"Everyone connected with the club feels like they are in the gutter and he has chosen this time to go for the manager - and maybe try and get him sacked.\"The one line that stands out for me was 'thrown under the bus'. He has tried to throw the club under the bus twice in the last 12 months.\"Going after the owners initially, he complained a year ago because they hadn't given him a contract at the age of 32.\"With the manager, he should be doing all he can to help the club get out of the worst run of results they have had since the 1950s.\"Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, former England captain Steph Houghton agreed.\"It probably couldn't have come at a worse time for Liverpool,\" she said.\"That's what makes us think this is something that was pre-planned. He probably expected to come on at some point [against Leeds], he didn't, and for Mo Salah that probably hurts his ego.\"But it's poor from him. I think it does put other people in jeopardy. It's got us talking about it, which he wants.\"Carragher also called for Salah not to be \"obsessed\" with his own numbers and help the other players, such as big-money signings Florian Wirtz and Alexander Isak, hoping to emulate his success at the club.\"Some of the criticism has been excessive this season but I will go after Mo Salah when he tries to throw my club under the bus off the pitch and just thinks about himself,\" he added.\"The club have made the right decision in him not going abroad with them and whether he will play for the club again I don't know.\"I hope he does because he is one of the greatest players we have ever had.\"'He's really let himself down'Media caption, 'He's put his team-mates in jeopardy' - CoadyAfter a stellar season in 2024-25, in which he spearheaded Liverpool's surge to the title, Salah has been short of his best this campaign with only five goals in 19 games.\"He's had a phenomenal career,\" Sutton said.\"This season he hasn't played so well, his numbers are down, he's not the same player and all of a sudden he's been left out for a few games and wants to live by different rules than other players in the dressing room.\"I find the whole situation absolutely ridiculous.\"What good could come out of what he did? What sickens me a bit about it is when Liverpool have been doing well, and players come out and speak, 'it's the team spirit, we all get on so great and everything's marvellous'.\"And now we're seeing Mo Salah for what he really is. It's all about him. It's him being selfish. I hate that sort of stuff. I think he's really let himself down here.\"It's all about who will go - will it be Slot or will it be Salah? And how is that beneficial for someone who loves the club so much?\"Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Wrexham defender Conor Coady added: \"I could only think that something has gone on behind the scenes that we don't know about.\"He should never, ever go to the press and do what he's done because you put your team-mates in jeopardy, and that's the most important thing. That's the biggest wrongdoing he can do in my eyes.\"Related topicsLiverpoolPremier LeagueFootball'I am not weak' says Slot, but Salah could returnPublished10 hours agoSalah says he has been 'thrown under the bus' by LiverpoolPublished2 days agoSalah left out by Liverpool for Inter Milan game Published15 hours agoMore on this storyLatest Liverpool news, analysis and fan viewsAsk about Liverpool - what do you want to know?",

    "fullText": "Image source, Getty ImagesImage caption, Mark Wood has taken 119 wickets in 38 Tests for EnglandByStephan ShemiltChief Cricket Reporter in NoosaPublished1 hour ago185 CommentsFast bowler Mark Wood has been ruled out of England's Ashes tour and replaced in the squad by Matthew Fisher.Wood only returned to action in the first Test in Perth after eight months out following knee surgery.The 35-year-old subsequently suffered swelling in the same left knee and was forced to miss the second Test.England were initially hopeful he could play a part in the remaining three Tests, but the Durham man is now due to go home at the weekend.\"Gutted to be out the remainder of the Ashes,\" wrote Wood in a post on Instagram.\"After extensive surgery and months of work and rehab to get back into the Test arena, my knee just hasn't held up.\"None of us expected this. I came here with high expectations about making a big impact. I'm desperately disappointed that despite yet more injections and intensive medical treatment it has become clear that the flare up in my knee is worse than feared.\"I'm really sorry that has left me unable to perform as expected but it is not for want of trying.\"However, he said he will attempt to make another comeback.\"Whatever happens I will continue to push the limits to get back again,\" Wood added. \"It has been a tough road these past few months but I remain determined to give it another proper go.\"I still believe we can turn things around. Never give in. Come on England.\"It is a huge blow to the tourists - who are already 2-0 down - and to Wood, whose international future is now in doubt.One of the fastest bowlers to ever play for England, Wood has taken 119 wickets in 38 Tests since making his debut in 2015.He was part of the team that won the Ashes in 2015, lifted the 2019 50-over World Cup and was in the England squad that won the T20 World Cup in 2022.His career has been blighted by injuries and the Perth Test was the end of a 15-month absence from Test cricket, firstly because of an elbow injury, then the knee problem.Wood bowled 11 overs at Perth Stadium, without taking a wicket. He has travelled with the rest of the England squad to their mid-series break in Noosa, but will not be part of the group for the third Test in Adelaide, beginning on 17 December (23:30 16 December GMT).Surrey's Fisher, 28, won his only Test cap on a tour of the West Indies in 2022. He has been part of the England Lions squad on their tour of Australia.Considered adept at bowling with the Kookaburra ball used in Australia, Fisher gets the nod ahead of Josh Hull.Sonny Baker and Tom Lawes would have been other options, but both were ruled out of the Lions squad with injuries.Meanwhile, Australia's Josh Hazlewood has also been ruled out of the remainder of the series.Hazlewood, 34, initially missed the first two Tests with a hamstring problem and has now suffered an Achilles tendon setback.However, Australia coach Andrew McDonald confirmed captain Pat Cummins is set to make his comeback when the hosts reveal their squad for the third Test on Wednesday.With Cummins due to return from a back problem and off-spinner Nathan Lyon likely to play in Adelaide after being left out of the day-night in Brisbane, Australia will make at least two changes to their team.Seamers Michael Neser and Brendan Doggett are the candidates to be left out.Australia could also recall batter Usman Khawaja after the opener struggled in the first Test with a back injury, then missed the second.McDonald said Khawaja could return at number five, leaving a new opening partnership of Travis Head and Jake Weatherald intact.Related topicsEngland Men's Cricket TeamThe AshesCricketMore on this storyGet cricket news sent straight to your phonePublished16 August",

    "fullText": "CLEVELAND HEIGHTS (WJW) – The wife of former Cleveland Heights Mayor Khalil Seren has entered a guilty plea to a misdemeanor trespassing charge on Monday in Cuyahoga County Common Pleas Court.Natalie McDaniel was sentenced to probation for two years and ordered to get a mental health evaluation. ‘Winter vomiting disease’ on uptick in Midwest, doctors warn McDaniel was facing a felony trespassing charge and a misdemeanor trespassing charge, but Cuyahoga County prosecutors agreed to a plea agreement where they would dismiss the felony charge if McDaniel entered a guilty plea.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhen first asked during Monday’s hearing if she would plead guilty, McDaniel insisted she was innocent.“I am prepared to enter a guilty plea today despite my belief that is dishonest,” McDaniel told the judge.Judge Jeffrey Saffold said he was concerned by McDaniel’s statement.“I don’t take it lightly to the waving of these rights,” Saffold said.  “So, when you come in here and say I didn’t know and I am going to enter a dishonest plea, I think that is the term you used, I become uncomfortable.”The judge then recessed the court hearing and advised McDaniel to discuss the matter with her attorney, Peter Pattakos.  A couple hours later, the hearing resumed, and McDaniel entered what is known as an Alford plea.  An Alford plea allows a defendant to plead guilty but maintain their innocence.AdvertisementAdvertisement Coyote tangled in Christmas lights reported in NE Ohio More in U.S.Divers Found a Lost Shipwreck So Remarkably Preserved, They Couldn’t Believe Its AgePopular Mechanics106Video of giant snake with unexpected discovery in its stomach sparks outrage: 'Definitely not what we want'The Cool Down106“Jeopardy” champ arrested on charges of felony secret peepingEntertainment WeeklyAlabama: Woman who alleged priest paid her for sex beginning at 17 says there’s ‘no real winner’ after his resignationThe Guardian1.3KMcDaniel was charged with entering the home of a residence in Cleveland Heights.  The incident happened in July.  McDaniel was caught on a home security video kneeling by a recall Mayor Seren sign. She then got up, walked up the front porch steps, opened the door and entered the home for about 15 seconds.  She is then seen walking out of the home.McDaniel and her husband, former Cleveland Heights’ Mayor Khalil Seren, first said she entered the home because she saw there was work being done, and she was looking for a contractor to do work at her house.  On Monday, however, her attorney said  that McDaniel thought someone other than the homeowners placed the recall sign in the yard.“She genuinely believed that the home did not have people living there that were the owners, so she believed that her husband’s political opponents had placed that sign there without permission,” Pattakos said during the hearing.AdvertisementAdvertisementMcDaniel and her husband, former Cleveland Heights’ mayor Khalil Seren, were at the center of several controversies while he served as mayor. In September, he was tossed out of office in a recall vote.The victims had the prosecutors read a statement saying they felt harassed after the incident. The victims in the case also had reservations about McDaniel making an Alford plea but told the prosecutors they agreed to it.McDaniel told the judge that she was “very sorry” the victims felt harassed after the incident.“To hear that they were scared, that people drove past their home and harassed them, I hated hearing that,” McDaniel said prior to sentencing. “And I understand that would not have happened but for my decisions. So, I am very sorry they are scared that they feel violated and hurt and harassed. I am very sorry they feel that way.”AdvertisementAdvertisementCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

Photograph: Daniella Lucas‘Kids can’t buy them anywhere’: how Pokémon cards became a stock market for millennialsA surprising economic bubble is making it hard for anyone to buy Pokémon cards – especially childrenPokémon has been huge since the late 90s. Millions of people have fond memories of playing the original Red and Blue games, or trading cards in the playground for that elusive shiny Charizard (if your school didn’t ban them). The franchise has only grown since then – but, where the trading cards are concerned, things have taken an unexpected and unfortunate turn. It’s now almost impossible to get your hands on newly released cards thanks to an insane rise in reselling and scalping over the past year.Selling on your old cards to collectors has always been part of the hobby, and like baseball cards or Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon cards can sometimes go for thousands of pounds. However, the resale market for Pokémon has climbed so high that even new cards are valued at hundreds, before they’ve even been released. The latest set, Phantasmal Flames, had a rare special illustration Charizard that was being valued at more than £600 before anyone had even found one. When a pack of cards retails at about £4, there’s a huge potential profit to be had.This has led to a speculative stock market developing around the card game with adults snapping up all of the cards they can get their hands on, making it impossible for kids, who may actually want to collect them or play the game associated with the cards, to get their hands on it.Online, via retailers such as Amazon, you can only request to buy Pokémon cards, after which everyone is entered into an opaque raffle for the chance to buy them. In the real world, meanwhile, resellers will queue for hours outside shops, hover around shelves as they’re being restocked and buy up every item before anyone else can see it – all just to buy boxes that are often kept sealed for later resale.“My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off,” says Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG – an independent shop specialising in trading card games. “It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of other stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberies. We’ve even seen people who buy our products and list them immediately on Facebook, while still in our carrier bags, or sell it right outside the shop. We’re even anxious to put stuff on the shelf for the public because we just don’t want to entice that sort of behaviour. We used to sell whole boxes of booster packs but now we’ve had to stop doing that, and even place limits on the individual packs.”‘My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off’ … Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG. Photograph: Daniella LucasFinley Pink, from Keynsham, travelled to BathTCG to arrive almost two hours before opening time to secure some cards at the recent launch of the Phantasmal Flames set. He was first in a line of 40 people. “This is the first set I’ve arrived early for, as I’ve been unable to get cards at other times. It’s a real struggle to find them,” he tells us. “Scalpers are making it impossible to find cards. It’s crazy and YouTubers talking up the money are making things even crazier!”Adding to the issue of scalpers is the popularity of YouTubers and TikTok influencers recording themselves opening packs, flicking through the contents at mesmerising speed, and listing the card values as they go, exaggerating reactions when they find a “hit”. Common cards are discarded, and only high-value cards matter. The joy of collecting or playing for fun is no longer the point – it’s all about maximising “value”.Pete Sessions, a project manager from Bristol, attended a Pokémon play night at the shop with his son Alfie and is concerned about influencers’ impact on the hobby for his child. “He’s been into Pokémon for a few years, but just got into collecting the cards over the past six months – I’ve had to ask shops when their stock drop days are just to try to find some,” he tells us. “Alfie watches YouTubers and he’s become very aware of the ‘value’ of cards. I’m worried about the perception that it’s easy to make loads of money, when that probably isn’t the case.”“People are opening these amazing cards on stream, but you don’t know how many thousands of packs they’ve probably gone through, or how much money they’ve spent,” adds Thyer. “So then they feed you the good stuff – that dopamine hit – and you think: ‘Oh, I can do that!’ And then you spend a silly amount of money hoping to get one hit.”The hype around potentially making hundreds of pounds by just opening a pack of cards has resulted in a volatile market, to the point that people now use apps such as Collectr to track their card portfolio for price rises and falls. It’s also led to devious practices such as selling fake cards, or opening and resealing packs after swapping out any rare cards.skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe latest set of Pokémon cards, Phantasmal Flames. Photograph: Daniella LucasAnd that’s all before the added layer of the card-grading industry comes into play. Cards can be sent to independent organisations, who rate and seal cards to potentially increase their value, depending on the grade they’re given. Card shows have now become a staple up and down the country, where hobbyists looking for their favourite cards are surrounded by those making trade deals worth, sometimes, tens of thousands.Despite the fact that The Pokémon Company printed 10.2bn cards in the year to March 2025, they’re still struggling to keep up with demand. When approached for comment, it shared a statement from seven months ago, saying that the company is “actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity”.Fortunately there are signs that the reseller market is starting to correct itself as more supply for older sets has started to trickle back on to shelves. “There are signs of the market cracking – prices of singles are coming down, sealed products are coming down. People aren’t as ferocious as they once were,” Thyer says. “There’s also a lot of people now thinking, ‘Christmas is soon and I need some money because I’ve not made what I was hoping for [from reselling cards]’. So we’ll see it dip, but then early 2026 brings Pokémon’s 30th anniversary, so I think we’ll see another crazy period.”While many shops have now adjusted booster pack pricing to reflect their perceived value and make the most of the Pokémon card boom, BathTCG refuses to give into that temptation. “We won’t do it to our customers,” Thyer says. “It’s hard as a business owner to say, ‘I don’t want to make more money’, but I don’t want to be another one of those shops remembered for scalping. Once the bubble bursts and everything goes back to normal, hopefully people will remember that we protected our community and looked after our players – that we ensured our local customers got cards at reasonable prices.”Explore more on these topicsPokémonGamesCollectingChildrenShoppingfeaturesShareReuse this content",

Photograph: Elena Sigtryggsson‘It has to be genuine’: older influencers drive growth on social mediaAs midlife audiences turn to digital media, the 55 to 64 age bracket is an increasingly important demographicIn 2022, Caroline Idiens was on holiday halfway up an Italian mountain when her brother called to tell her to check her Instagram account. “I said, ‘I haven’t got any wifi. And he said: ‘Every time you refresh, it’s adding 500 followers.’ So I had to try to get to the top of the hill with the phone to check for myself.”A personal trainer from Berkshire who began posting her fitness classes online at the start of lockdown in 2020, Idiens, 53, had already built a respectable following.But after one video offering guidance on getting toned summer arms was picked up by a US fitness account, that number rocketed to 50,000 – and beyond. “I post it every year now as a bit of a tribute,” she jokes. “It was that reel that launched me into a whole new market.”Today, as @carolinescircuits, she has 2.3 million followers on Instagram, more than 70,000 on Tiktok and 50,000 on YouTube, and a book, Fit at 50, that was a recent Sunday Times bestseller – making her a key influencer in an increasingly important demographic for social media platforms: those in midlife and older.If you want to grow your reach on social media, figures suggested this week, you could do worse than target the over-55s.Research from media analysts Ampere found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth in YouTube traffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. Tiktok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.Valerie Mackay has gained 312,000 followers on Tiktok and almost 1 million on Instagram as @embracingfifty.“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” says Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division.“And by getting access to things like smartphones and smart TVs in particular, it’s opening up a whole new world for them.” More than half of US adults in the age bracket now watch influencer videos weekly.Some of them will be tuning in to Valerie Mackay from Inverness, who as @embracingfifty has gained 312,000 followers on Tiktok and almost 1 million on Instagram since she started her warmly chatty account eight years ago.“In hindsight, I wouldn’t have picked that name ’cause I’m now 62 and stuck with it. But the point of the name was I was embracing life over 50. I had two children, they had both left home and I was enjoying life with myself and my husband, it was like freedom.”She founded her account after overhearing a woman asking what was the point of makeup and style after a certain age. “I just thought, well, what’s the point in life? Just dress and be who you want to be.”Mackay says she tries not to think about the huge numbers watching her from around the world – many of whom share an interest in the Scottish weather.“I get asked a lot: ‘I’m coming to Scotland, what do I wear?’ Which it’s difficult for me to answer because I might be flitting about in a trench coat and they might need big coats.”Mark Lidster is a 62-year-old from north London who posts videos as FitnessGeezer on YouTube and Instagram, attracting up to 1m views. “There are a lot of guys out there getting to 40, through to 70, 80 – who relate and take inspiration from what I’m doing,” he says.Mark Lidster, AKA FitnessGeezer, says he tries to create a community feel. Photograph: Mark LidsterLike Mackay, Lidster says actively engaging with his audience is crucial. As well as becoming more savvy with tech, he says, “people of that age are feeling more disconnected from society, and getting lonelier. Social media is another way of feeling part of something – I try to create that community feel.”The crucial thing with 50-somethings and older is “to keep it genuine”, says Idiens, who is 53.“The biggest thing about social media in this age bracket is trust,” she says.“It has to be genuine – we are a little bit older and wiser, and what the audience are really looking for are people that they can trust with advice. For the midlife demographic, they also really love that sense of community.“Even with an audience of 2 million, I still think, when I’m putting up a post, that it’s going to my friends and family group. And the feedback I get is that [my followers] still feel like I’m a PT [personal trainer] in their sitting room – which, for me, is everything. That’s what I want.”Explore more on these topicsYouTubeSocial mediaDigital mediaInternetFitnessMidlakeMiddle agefeaturesShareReuse this content",

Photograph: Bloomberg/Getty ImagesScores of UK parliamentarians join call to regulate most powerful AI systemsExclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligenceMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.A former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.The push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.The campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.The Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.Britain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.Goldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.The calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”‘The biggest decision yet’: Jared Kaplan on allowing AI to train itselfRead moreLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.A spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”The bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”skip past newsletter promotionafter newsletter promotionThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.The chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”He said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.“It’s quite urgent,” he said.Explore more on these topicsArtificial intelligence (AI)ComputingRegulatorsnewsShareReuse this content",

Photograph: Jim Lo Scalzo/EPAMore than 200 environmental groups demand halt to new US datacentersExclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisisA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.The green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.The push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.These seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.This threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.However, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”Yet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”Hua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.But it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.More broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.This focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.At the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.But it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”Explore more on these topicsUS newsEnergyArtificial intelligence (AI)newsShareReuse this content",

Photograph: Cavan Images/AlamySocial media use damages children’s ability to focus, say researchersStudy of 8,300 US children suggests social media may be contributing to a rise in ADHD diagnosesIncreased use of social media by children damages their concentration levels and may be contributing to an increase in cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, according to a study.The peer-reviewed report monitored the development of more than 8,300 US-based children from the age of 10 to 14 and linked social media use to “increased inattention symptoms”.Reseachers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the Oregon Health & Science University in the US found that children spent an average of 2.3 hours a day watching television or online videos, 1.4 hours on social media and 1.5 hours playing video games.No link was found between ADHD-related symptoms – such as being easily distracted – and playing video games or watching TV and YouTube. However, the study found that social media use over a period of time was associated with an increase in inattention symptoms in children. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, forgetting everyday tasks and difficulty focusing.“We identified an association between social media use and increased inattention symptoms, interpreted here as a likely causal effect,” said the study. “Although the effect size is small at individual level, it could have significant consequences if behaviour changes across population level. These findings suggest that social media use may contribute to rising incidence of ADHD diagnoses.”Torkel Klingberg, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute, said: “Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate.“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”The study found the ADHD link was not affected by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards the condition. Klingberg added that increased use of social media may explain part of the increase in ADHD diagnoses. Its prevalence among children has risen from 9.5% in 2003-07 to 11.3% in 2020-22, according to the US national survey of children’s health.The researchers stressed the results did not imply all children who used social media developed concentration problems. But they pointed to increased use of social media by children as they got older and to children using social media well before they turned 13, the minimum age for apps such as TikTok and Instagram.The report said: “This early and increasing social media use underscores the need for stricter age verification and clearer guidelines for tech companies.”The study found a steady increase in social media use from about 30 minutes a day at age nine to two and a half hours a day by age 13. The children were enrolled for the study at the ages of nine and 10 between 2016 and 2018. The study will be published in the Pediatrics Open Science journal.“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said Samson Nivins, one of the study’s authors and a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institute.Explore more on these topicsInternet safetySocial mediaAttention deficit hyperactivity disorderHealthChildrenDigital mediaSocial networkingnewsShareReuse this content",

(Sarah Yenesel/Pool Photo via AP)NEW YORK (AP) — Moments after Luigi Mangione was handcuffed at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s, a police officer searching his backpack found a loaded gun magazine wrapped in a pair of underwear.The discovery, recounted in court Monday as Mangione fights to keep evidence out of his New York murder case, convinced police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that he was the man wanted in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan five days earlier.“It's him, dude. It's him, 100%,” an officer was heard saying on body-worn camera video from Mangione’s Dec. 9, 2024 arrest, punctuating the remark with expletives as the officer combing the bag, Christy Wasser, held up the magazine.AdvertisementAdvertisementWasser, a 19-year Altoona police veteran, testified on the fourth day of a pretrial hearing as Mangione sought to bar prosecutors from using the magazine and other evidence against him, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook found during a subsequent bag search.The testimony shed light on the critical minutes after Mangione was spotted at the McDonald’s and the sometimes unusual steps police officers took in collecting evidence critical to tying him to the crime.Why the defense says the evidence shouldn't be used at trialMangione’s lawyers argue the items should be excluded because police didn’t have a search warrant and lacked the grounds to justify a warrantless search. Prosecutors contend the search was legal and that police eventually obtained a warrant.AdvertisementAdvertisementWasser, testifying in full uniform, said Altoona police protocols require promptly searching a suspect’s property at the time of an arrest, in part for dangerous items.On body-worn camera video played in court, Wasser was heard saying she wanted to check the bag for bombs before removing it from the McDonald’s. Despite that concern, she acknowledged in her testimony Monday that police never cleared the restaurant of customers or employees.Mangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. He appeared in good health on Monday, pumping his fist for photographers and chatting with his lawyers as testimony resumed.The hearing, which was postponed Friday because of Mangione’s apparent illness, applies only to the state case. His lawyers are making a similar push to exclude the evidence from his federal case, where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhy prosecutors say jurors should be able to see the evidenceMore in U.S.Divers Found a Lost Shipwreck So Remarkably Preserved, They Couldn’t Believe Its AgePopular Mechanics106Video of giant snake with unexpected discovery in its stomach sparks outrage: 'Definitely not what we want'The Cool Down106“Jeopardy” champ arrested on charges of felony secret peepingEntertainment WeeklyAlabama: Woman who alleged priest paid her for sex beginning at 17 says there’s ‘no real winner’ after his resignationThe Guardian1.3KProsecutors have said the handgun found in the backpack matches the firearm used in the killing and that writings in the notebook showed Mangione’s disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference.Thompson, 50, was killed as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.Mangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Manhattan, after police there received a 911 call about a McDonald’s customer resembling the suspect.AdvertisementAdvertisementWasser testified that she went to the McDonald’s on her own to assist another officer, Joseph Detwiler. Before that, she said, she had seen some coverage of Thompson’s killing on Fox News, including the surveillance video of the shooting and images of the suspected shooter.Wasser began searching Mangione’s bag as officers took him into custody on initial charges of forgery and false identification, after he acknowledged giving them a bogus driving license, police said. The same fake name was used by the alleged gunman used at a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting.By then, a handcuffed Mangione had been informed of his right to remain silent — and invoked it — when asked if there was anything in the bag that officers should be concerned about.Wasser told another officer she wanted to check the bag for a bomb before leaving the McDonald’s because she didn’t want to repeat an incident in which another Altoona officer had inadvertently brought a bomb to the police station.AdvertisementAdvertisementWhat did police find in Mangione's bag?“Did you call the bomb squad?” Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo asked.“No. I didn’t find a bomb yet,” Wasser responded.According to body-worn camera video, the first few items Wasser found were innocuous: a hoagie, a loaf of bread and a smaller bag containing a passport, cellphone and computer chip.Then she pulled out a gray pair of underwear, unwrapping them to reveal the magazine.Satisfied there was no bomb, she suspended her search and placed some of the items back in the bag. Some evidence, including Mangione’s laptop computer, was transported to the police station in a brown paper McDonald’s takeout bag, body-worn camera video showed.AdvertisementAdvertisementWasser resumed her search after an 11-minute drive to the police station and almost immediately found the gun and silencer — the latter discovery prompting her to laugh and exclaim “nice,” according to body-worn camera footage. Wasser said the gun was in a side pocket that she hadn't searched at McDonald’s.Later, while cataloging everything in the bag in what's known as an inventory search, she found the notebook and other notes, including what appeared to to-do lists and possible getaway plans.“Isn't it awesome?” Wasser said at one point during the search, according to the body-worn camera video.Asked to explain, she told Friedman Agnifilo on Monday that she was proud of her police department’s work in helping to capture Thompson’s suspected killer.AdvertisementAdvertisementA Blair County, Pennsylvania, prosecutor testified that a judge later signed off on a search warrant for the bag, a few hours after the searches were completed. The warrant, she said, provided a legal mechanism for Altoona police to turn the evidence over to New York City detectives investigating Thompson’s killing.As he has throughout the case, Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann described Thompson’s killing as an “execution” and referred to his notebook as a “manifesto” — terms that Mangione’s lawyers said were prejudicial and inappropriate.Judge Gregory Carro said the wording had “no bearing” on him, but warned Seidemann that he’s “certainly not going to do that at trial” when jurors are present.About Our Ads",

Laura Grace Tarpley · Lead Editor and Content Strategist, Mortgages Hal Bundrick, CFP® · Senior Writer Mon, December 8, 2025 at 5:00 AM CST 5 min read Mortgage rates have risen since last week. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is up 13 basis points to 6.10%, and the 15-year fixed rate has increased by 14 basis points to 5.55%. The Federal Reserve will announce whether it is cutting the federal funds rate for a third time this year on Wednesday. Many experts predict that the central bank will lower its rate again — but based on how mortgage rates have reacted to previous rate cuts, that doesn't necessarily mean home loan rates will decrease in response. However, they might fall if the Fed indicates that it intends to slash rates more aggressively next year. Learn more about why mortgage rates didn't decrease after the last fed funds rate cut. Current mortgage rates Here are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data: 30-year fixed: 6.10% 20-year fixed: 5.97% 15-year fixed: 5.55% 5/1 ARM: 6.45% 7/1 ARM: 6.38% 30-year VA: 5.56% 15-year VA: 5.22% 5/1 VA: 5.40% Remember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth. See the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week. Current mortgage refinance rates These are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data: 30-year fixed: 6.15% 20-year fixed: 6.09% 15-year fixed: 5.63% 5/1 ARM: 6.43% 7/1 ARM: 6.69% 30-year VA: 5.62% 15-year VA: 5.47% 5/1 VA: 5.37% Again, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case. MORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.

How the Federal Reserve shapes consumer loan rates Mortgage payment calculator You can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest. You can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders. 30-year mortgage rates today Today’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.10%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low. If you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.10% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,818, and you’d pay $354,474 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000. 15-year mortgage rates today The average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.55% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage. A 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound. However, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time. If you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.55% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,459. But you’d only pay $142,659. How much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator. Adjustable mortgage rates With an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year. Adjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later. Lately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others. How to get a low mortgage rate Mortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes. You can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term. Just consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump attends a roundtable discussion with farmers at the White House , December 8, 2025. - Jonathan Ernst/ReutersPresident Donald Trump on Monday falsely denied making a comment he had made on camera just five days prior. Then he launched a personal attack against the reporter who had accurately repeated his previous remark.Trump has a long history of falsely denying he ever said things he had said in public.The subject of his latest false denial was the video footage of the September 2 US military strikes against a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean. The military conducted a follow-up strike to kill the people who had survived the first strike.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe Trump administration publicly released the video of the initial strike but not the video of the follow-up strike, which has been shown to members of Congress behind closed doors. On December 3, Trump said he has no problem releasing this video to the American people.Here’s the December 3 exchange he had with ABC News reporter Selina Wang at the White House:Wang: Mr. President, you released video of that first boat strike on September 2nd, but not the second video. Will you release video of that strike so that the American people can see for themselves what happened?Trump: I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’d certainly release, no problem. AdvertisementAdvertisementOn Monday, another ABC News reporter, Rachel Scott, repeated Trump’s comment back to him while trying to ask a question about the potential release of the additional video. But the president denied he had said what he said:Scott: Mr. President, you said you would have no problem with releasing the full video of that strike on September 2nd off the coast of Venezuela. Secretary Hegseth now says –Trump: I didn’t say that. That’s – you said that, I didn’t say that. This is ABC fake news.Scott correctly noted, “You said that you would have no problem releasing the full vi(deo).” She then pivoted back to her question. She noted that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the question of whether to release the video is being reviewed, and she asked Trump if he is ordering Hegseth to release it.AdvertisementAdvertisement“Whatever he decides is okay with me,” Trump said.More in PoliticsLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman says he learned a lesson from a visit to Epstein's island: 'Note to self, Google before going'Business Insider503New Poll Reveals Clear Democratic Favorite in 2028 White House RaceMediaite2.7KTucker Carlson Tells Forum in Doha That He’s Buying a House in Qatar to ‘Make a Statement That I’m an American and a Free Man’Mediaite743“Kicking a—“: Fans turn on beloved 1990s sitcom star after his high praise for TrumpSILive.com923Trump then offered a defense of the strikes, repeating his frequent false claim that each boat destroyed saves “25,000 American lives” and claiming the survivors “were trying to turn the boat back to where it could float, and we didn’t want to see that, because that boat was loaded up with drugs.” When Scott eventually interjected to try to return to the issue of releasing the video, he called her “the most obnoxious reporter in the whole place” and “actually a terrible reporter.”CNN has reached out to an ABC News spokesperson about the president’s remarks about Scott. Another ABC News journalist, Jonathan Karl, wrote on the social media platform X that Scott “quoted President Trump accurately.”For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.comAbout Our Ads",

    "fullText": "DeepSeek founder Liang Wenfeng cleans up on chip firm Moore Threads' Shanghai IPO South China Morning Post Mon, December 8, 2025 at 3:30 AM CST 3 min read NVDA Chinese entrepreneur Liang Wenfeng, the founder and CEO of DeepSeek, appears to have made a big score from the initial public offering of chip designer Moore Threads Technology, whose shares surged more than fivefold in its trading debut in Shanghai. High-Flyer Quantitative Fund, a hedge fund co-founded by Liang, had subscribed to a total of 82,244 shares of Moore Threads, at 114.28 yuan per share, via two entities: Zhejiang High-Flyer Asset Management and Ningbo High-Flyer Quant Investment Management Partnership. That made High-Flyer one of the stock's top institutional investors, according to the subscription results reported by the Beijing-based firm, known as China's answer to Nvidia. Over the past two trading days, Moore Threads shares rose more than five times, resulting in a nearly 40 million yuan (US$5.6 million) profit for High-Flyer, according to the Post's calculation based on the stock's 594.25 yuan closing price on Monday.

The company raised about 8 billion yuan in its IPO, which was the mainland's second-largest listing this year. Investor interest in Moore Threads underscores China's push for technology self-sufficiency, which forms part of the country's 15th five-year plan through 2030. The company had a quick path to the capital market, getting the green light from the China Securities Regulatory Commission in October, a mere four months after its application, compared with the average processing time of about 470 days for last year's applicants on the Shanghai Stock Exchange Science and Technology Innovation Board, also known as the Star Market. Moore Threads' prospectus showed that in the first half of this year, revenue reached about 70 million yuan, which already exceeded its total sales for the previous year, though the company remains unprofitable. The chip designer said it expected to achieve consolidated profitability as early as 2027. Moore Threads Technology founder James Zhang Jianzhong at a product launch in December 2023.

The drone was also seized Sunday morning, authorities said.Prison officials said they are investigating and no arrests have been made.“I’m guessing the inmates who were expecting the package are crabby,” prisons spokeswoman Chrysti Shain said.Keeping contraband out of state prisons is a constant battle. People would toss or use a catapult to get packages of cellphones, drugs or other illegal items over the perimeter fence until officials raised the fences and added netting at the top.AdvertisementAdvertisementPeople trying to smuggle things behind bars moved on to drones, leaving corrections officials to constantly patrol the prison yard and just outside for the tiny aircraft trying to drop packages.Just flying a drone near a prison in South Carolina is a misdemeanor crime that carries up to 30 days in jail. Dropping contraband into the prison is a felony that can land someone behind bars for 10 years.About Our Ads",

The calculus were made based on weight.The first round resulted in 83 pounds (38 kilograms), which \"corresponds to approximately 23,000 to 24,000 coins,\" Vincent Geneviève, a numismatist with INRAP who is analyzing the hoards, told Live Science in an email.A researcher excavates one of the 1,700-year-old coin hoards.

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump arrives for the lighting of the National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse, Thursday, Dec. 4, 2025, near the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Julia Demaree Nikhinson)WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump will road-test his claims that he's tackling Americans' affordability woes at a Tuesday rally in Mount Pocono, Pennsylvania — shifting an argument made in Oval Office appearances and social media posts to a campaign-style event.The trip comes as polling consistently shows that public trust in Trump's economic leadership has faltered. Following dismal results for Republicans in last month's off-cycle elections, the White House has sought to convince voters that the economy will emerge stronger next year and that any anxieties over inflation have nothing to do with Trump.The president has consistently blamed his predecessor, Democrat Joe Biden, for inflation even as his own aggressive implementation of policies has pushed up prices that had been settling down after spiking in 2022 to a four-decade high. Inflation began to accelerate after Trump announced his sweeping “Liberation Day” tariffs in April. Companies warned that the import taxes could be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices and reduced hiring, yet Trump continues to insist that inflation has faded.AdvertisementAdvertisement“We’re bringing prices way down,\" Trump said at the White House on Monday. “You can call it ‘affordability’ or anything you want — but the Democrats caused the affordability problem and we’re the ones that are fixing it.”The president's reception in the county hosting his Tuesday rally could give a signal of just how much voters trust his claims. Monroe County flipped to Trump in the 2024 election after having backed Biden in 2020, helping the Republican to win the swing state of Pennsylvania and return to the White House after a four-year hiatus.As home to the Pocono Mountains, the county has largely relied on tourism for skiing, hiking, hunting and other activities as a source of jobs. Its proximity to New York City — under two hours by car — has also attracted people seeking more affordable housing.It's also an area that could help decide control of the House in next year's midterm elections.AdvertisementAdvertisementTrump is holding his rally in a congressional district held by freshman Republican Rep. Rob Bresnahan, who is a top target of Democrats and won his 2024 race by about 1.5 percentage points, among the nation’s closest. Scranton Mayor Paige Cognetti, a Democrat, is running for the nomination to challenge him.White House chief of staff Susie Wiles said on the online conservative talk show “The Mom View” that Trump would be on the “campaign trail” next year to engage supporters who otherwise might sit out a congressional race.Wiles, who helped manage Trump's 2024 campaign, said most administrations try to localize midterm elections and keep the president out of the race, but she intends to do the opposite of that.“We’re actually going to turn that on its head,\" Wiles said, \"and put him on the ballot because so many of those low-propensity voters are Trump voters.”AdvertisementAdvertisementWiles added, “So I haven’t quite broken it to him yet, but he’s going to campaign like it’s 2024 again.”More in PoliticsLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman says he learned a lesson from a visit to Epstein's island: 'Note to self, Google before going'Business Insider503Fact check: Trump denies saying something he said on camera five days agoCNN2.7KTucker Carlson Tells Forum in Doha That He’s Buying a House in Qatar to ‘Make a Statement That I’m an American and a Free Man’Mediaite743“Kicking a—“: Fans turn on beloved 1990s sitcom star after his high praise for TrumpSILive.com923Trump has said he's giving consumers relief by relaxing fuel efficiency standards for autos and signing agreements to reduce list prices on prescription drugs.Trump has also advocated for cuts to the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate — which influences the supply of money in the U.S. economy. He argues that would reduce the cost of mortgages and auto loans, although critics warn that cuts of the scale sought by Trump could instead worsen inflation.The U.S. economy has shown signs of resilience with the stock market up this year and overall growth looking solid for the third quarter. But many Americans see the prices of housing, groceries, education, electricity and other basic needs as swallowing up their incomes, a dynamic that the Trump administration has said it expects to fade next year with more investments in artificial intelligence and manufacturing.AdvertisementAdvertisementSince the November elections where Democrats won key races with a focus on kitchen-table issues, Trump has often dismissed the concerns about prices as a “hoax” and “con job” to suggest that he bears no responsibility for inflation, even though he campaigned on his ability to quickly bring down prices. Just 33% of U.S. adults approve of Trump's handling of the economy, according to a November survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.___Levy reported from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.About Our Ads",

(AP Photo/Jeffrey Collins)(ASSOCIATED PRESS)ST. MATTHEWS, S.C. (AP) — The former court clerk in South Carolina who helped out with the murder trial of attorney Alex Murdaugh pleaded guilty Monday to criminal charges for showing sealed court exhibits to a photographer and lying about it in court.Former Colleton County Clerk of Court Mary Rebecca “Becky” Hill pleaded guilty in Colleton County Circuit Court to four charges — obstruction of justice and perjury for showing a reporter photographs that were sealed court exhibits and then lying about it — as well as two counts of misconduct in office for taking bonuses and promoting through her public office a book she wrote on the trial.Judge Heath Taylor sentenced Hill, 58, to three years of probation. The judge told Hill her sentence would have been much harsher if investigators had found that she had tampered with the Murdaugh jury.AdvertisementAdvertisementHill apologizes for her crimesHill read a short statement where she asked the judge for a chance to do better.\"There is no excuse for the mistakes I made. I’m ashamed of them and will carry that shame the rest of my life,” she said.Hill was in charge of taking care of the jury, overseeing exhibits and helping the judge during Murdaugh's six-week trial that ended with murder convictions for killing his wife and son. The case involved power, danger, money and privilege and an attorney whose family had lorded over his small South Carolina county for nearly a century.Hill has played a prominent part as Murdaugh appeals his convictions and a sentence of life without parole. His lawyers said Hill tried to influence jurors to vote guilty and that she was biased against Murdaugh for her book.AdvertisementAdvertisementProsecutors investigated jury tampering allegationsProsecutors said they investigated jury tampering allegations. Three jurors or alternates suggested Hill said things that may have been an attempt to influence them. Eleven others who were questioned by state agents said she did nothing wrong. Solicitor Rick Hubbard said that would have made it impossible to prove a tampering charge.More in U.S.Divers Found a Lost Shipwreck So Remarkably Preserved, They Couldn’t Believe Its AgePopular Mechanics106Video of giant snake with unexpected discovery in its stomach sparks outrage: 'Definitely not what we want'The Cool Down106“Jeopardy” champ arrested on charges of felony secret peepingEntertainment WeeklyAlabama: Woman who alleged priest paid her for sex beginning at 17 says there’s ‘no real winner’ after his resignationThe Guardian1.3KDuring Monday's hearing, Hubbard told the judge that a journalist told investigators that Hill showed graphic crime scene photos to several media members. He did not name the journalist.The photos were briefly posted online and Hubbard said metadata from the images matched up with a time where Hill's courthouse key card said she was inside the locked room where the photos were kept.AdvertisementAdvertisementMurdaugh is also serving a separate sentence of decades in prison for admitting to stealing millions of dollars from settlements for clients who suffered horrible injuries or deaths — and from his family’s law firm.An initial appeal by Murdaugh’s lawyers was denied. But Judge Jean Toal said she wasn’t sure Hill told the truth about her dealings with jurors and was “attracted by the siren call of celebrity” status.Along with showing the sealed exhibits, an arrest warrant said Hill lied to Toal during a January 2024 hearing when the judge asked: “Did you allow anyone from the press to view the sealed exhibits?”One of Murdadugh's lawyers said Hill pleading guilty didn't surprise him. Attorney Dick Harpootlian said he also wasn't surprised the same State Law Enforcement Division that investigated the Murdaugh killings didn't find jury tampering.AdvertisementAdvertisement“If Becky admittedly perjured herself in the jury tampering hearing held by Judge Toal, what else could she have lied about?” Harpootlian said in a statement.Hill admitted taking money from her officeOne of the charges — misconduct in office — involved money that investigators said Hill took for herself. She brought a check to court on Monday to pay back nearly $10,000 meant for bonuses from federal money meant to improve child support collection and about $2,000 in money from the Clerk of Court’s office.The warrant on the other misconduct charge said Hill used her public role as clerk of court to promote her book on the Murdaugh trial on social media.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe judge said he knows Hill has been more humiliated than most people who come before him because of all the attention from the true crime world on the Murdaugh case.“ A lot of boats got swept up in the hoopla that was at that trial,” Taylor said. “A lot of folks probably made a lot of money, but you didn’t.”Hill was also accused last May of 76 counts of ethics violations. Officials said Hill allowed a photo of Murdaugh in a holding cell to be taken to promote her book on the trial and used county money to buy dozens of lunches for her staff, prosecutors and a vendor.Hill also struck a deal with a documentary maker to use the county courtroom in exchange for promoting her book on the trial, which later she admitted had plagiarized passages, according to the South Carolina Ethics Commission complaint.AdvertisementAdvertisementHill resigned in March 2024 during the last year of her four-year term, citing the public scrutiny of Murdaugh’s trial and wanting to spend time with her grandchildren.___This story corrects Hill's sentence to three years of probation.About Our Ads",

Then, make the psi-platforms materialize so you can grab the item.Fury Green Missile Expansion #2Sub-zone: Broken HallLocation: After you beat the Carvex boss and obtain the Psychic Bomb ability, you'll go through a narrow passageway in your Morph Ball form. To your left, there's an object that you can blow up with your Psychic Bomb.Fury Green Missile Expansion #3Sub-zone: Reflection ChamberLocation: This Missile Expansion can be found in the room with the giant mech--i.e. the one near the base camp. That said, it'll probably be the last one that you obtain from this particular zone. That's because it's inside a heavy container that can only be destroyed once you have the Super Missile upgrade from the Great Mines area.Fury Green Missile Expansion #4Sub-zone: Cliffside GateLocation: Found in the same area that has an Energy Tank. Revisit this place once you have the Psychic Boots and hop on the ledges to grab your prize.Fury Green Missile Expansion #5Sub-zone: Grove of the Sacred TreeLocation: You'll stumble upon this Missile Expansion in Metroid Prime 4: Beyond quite early in the game. Basically, after you rescue Mackenzie, you'll see two resin-covered walls in the Grove of the Sacred Tree. One has a doorway that leads to the next area. The other, meanwhile, has a small nook that contains this item.Fury Green Missile Expansion #6Sub-zone: Resin CreekLocation: Resin Creek is part of the section with narrow passageways that are close to the first save point in the zone. Defeat the Carvex boss first to receive the Psychic Bomb. Then, return to this area and look for a large orange fruit. Transform into a Morph Ball, jump, and drop a bomb charge to destroy it.Volt Forge: Missile Expansions mapThe map above shows the locations of the Missile Expansions in Volt Forge. You can head to this zone after using the launcher in Fury Green. It's also where you acquire the Vi-O-La motorcycle, which makes exploration a breeze.Volt Forge Missile Expansion #1Sub-zone: Tower 1 - Facility ApproachLocation: Enter Volt Forge proper to trigger a cutscene. Then, check the back of a nearby metal container.Volt Forge Missile Expansion #2Sub-zone: Tower 1 - Loading AirlockLocation: Revisit this area once you have the Psychic Boost Ball upgrade. Use your Morph Ball boost repeatedly in the device until the metal container rams and dislodges the cargo.Volt Forge Missile Expansion #3Sub-zone: Tower 1 - Speed Tunnel CLocation: You can acquire this Metroid Prime 4 Missile Expansion by going to the track that connects Tower 1 to Tower 3. Look above you to spot an item, then walk to the edge of the track. Fire your Control Beam and guide the projectile to the interior of the shaft until it hits the glyph.Volt Forge Missile Expansion #4Sub-zone: Tower 1 - Irradiation FloorLocation: You can also get this upgrade once you have the Psychic Boost Ball. At the bottom of the Irradiation Floor, turn into the Morph Ball and keep using the boost on the half pipes.Volt Forge Missile Expansion #5Sub-zone: Tower 1 - ProcessingLocation: Transform into a Morph Ball and hop on top of the pedestal. Keep using the Psychic Boost Ball ability until the item is revealed.Volt Forge Missile Expansion #6Sub-zone: Tower 2 - Receiving LobbyLocation: Restore the electricity in Tower 2, then return to the topmost floor. Interact with the terminal and transform into a Morph Ball. Squeeze through the gap and roll all the way to the center to claim the item.Volt Forge Missile Expansion #7Sub-zone: Tower 3 - CertificationLocation: Just before the boss arena at the bottom of Tower 3, you should see a cave-in to your right. Fire a missile to destroy the rocks, then use your psychic powers to trace the pattern on the floating container.Volt Forge Missile Expansion #8Sub-zone: Tower 3 - CertificationLocation: There's a mechanism in the corner of the room just outside the save point. You need to pull the latch open with the Psychic Grapple. Then, blast the core several times with the Thunder Shot until the container opens.Ice Belt: Missile Expansions mapThere are several Metroid Prime 4 Missile Expansions in the Ice Belt zone. Some of these can be acquired during your first visit. The rest, however, require various Power Suit upgrades and abilities, including the Psychic Grapple and Psychic Spider Ball.Ice Belt Missile Expansion #1Sub-zone: Surface - Loading CraneLocation: Upon entering the Ice Belt zone, look for a device behind some crates. Turn into a Morph Ball and activate it with your Psychic Bomb.Ice Belt Missile Expansion #2Sub-zone: Surface - Ancient TempleLocation: You need the Psychic Grapple and Thunder Shot for this item. Both abilities allow you to reach the Ancient Temple sub-zone, which is also where you unlock the Psychic Spider Ball upgrade. Note that the Missile Expansion is off to the side of the steps leading to the chamber.Ice Belt Missile Expansion #3Sub-zone: Bio-Labs - Bio-Labs AccessLocation: Acquire the TK Codes and the Psychic Lasso ability on your first visit to Ice Belt. Then, pry open the door to the right of the purple glyph. Use the lasso to pull the debris away.Ice Belt Missile Expansion #4Sub-zone: Bio-Labs - Lobby CircuitLocation: You'll see this particular section as you're making your way back to the top of the facility after restoring power. However, you can only reach the very top in Morph Ball form once you have the Psychic Spider Ball ability. Tether onto the circular indentations, then use your Psychic Bomb to activate the two nodes at the top. You need to do this before the barricades blocking the item completely shut.Ice Belt Missile Expansion #5Sub-zone: Medical Bays - Surgery CorridorLocation: While exploring the back portion of the Medical Bays, you'll notice a grate that you can pull with the Psychic Lasso. Enter it via Morph Ball and blow up the obstacle that's blocking the path.Ice Belt Missile Expansion #6Sub-zone: Medical Bays - Staging CorridorLocation: You're likely to spot this particular Metroid Prime 4 Missile Expansion while exploring the Medical Bays. That said, you can only gain access to this room after fully restoring power to the facility. A Griever will emerge from one of the rooms when you return to this floor. Enter that room and go through the hole via Morph Ball.Ice Belt Missile Expansion #7Sub-zone: Medical Bays - Storage BayLocation: This item is in the chamber that has a frozen Griever specimen and thousands of experiment pods lining the walls. Make sure you have the aforementioned Psychic Spider Ball ability first.Drop down to the lower area of this room and enter the hole via Morph Ball.Latch onto the railing and destroy the bot with your Psychic Bombs.Use your Psychic Bombs to jump and reach the Missile Expansion. This can be done by placing one bomb, and then waiting for a couple of seconds before placing the second bomb. Activate the third bomb immediately as soon as you get tossed in mid-air. With a bit of luck, your \"bomb jump\" should help you grab this item.Ice Belt Missile Expansion #8Sub-zone: Quarantine - Elevator LandingLocation: This Missile Expansion is in a locked room just before the boss' arena. You need the Thunder Shot to unlock the metal gate.Flare Pool Missile Expansion #1Sub-zone: Volcano EntranceLocation: In the first room in Flare Pool, use your psychic powers to make several platforms materialize. Then, hop on top of them with your Psychic Boots.These are the Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Missile Expansions that we've obtained so far. We'll let you know once we find several others, so stay tuned.Venture forth across the endless dunes of Viewros and delve deeper into long-forgotten alien facilities. If ever you need help with various facets, you can always visit our Metroid Prime 4: Beyond guides hub.",

    "fullText": "Another airline set to shut down and cancel all flights over the next day Veronika Bondarenko Mon, December 8, 2025 at 10:41 AM CST 3 min read Over the last few months, several airlines north of the border have seen ongoing labor disputes reach the kind of impasse that resulted in disrupted travel. Over the course of four days between Aug. 16 and 19, 2025, Canadian flag carrier Air Canada canceled over 700 flights as its roughly 10,000 flight attendants chose job action instead of the 38% pay raise over four years initially presented by the airline. The union and the airline eventually reached an agreement that better compensates flight attendants for their time before and after flights. Four months later, Montreal-based Air Transat is now the airline that is preparing to wind down operations as CBC reported the union representing its 750 pilots issued a 72-hour strike notice on Dec. 7. The pilot's union had been pushing to overhaul a work contract established for \"industry-standard pay, benefits, work rules, and job security;\" 99% of its members voted to authorize a strike after what they say is a lack of response from Air Transat. Air Transat \"will be responsible for every cancelled flight and stranded passenger\": pilot \"No pilot wants to strike, but Air Transat management has left us no choice,\" Capt. Bradley Small, an Air Transat pilot representing a group within the union, said in a statement, as reported by BBC. \"Months of unproductive bargaining ends now. If we cannot reach an agreement, management will be responsible for every cancelled flight and stranded passenger.\" Related: Air Canada starts handing out refunds as flights slow to resume Operating since 1987, Air Transat is a large vacation airline commonly booked by Canadians on the East Coast for flights to sunny destinations in Florida and the Caribbean, as well as other destinations in Europe and South America. In its own statement released late on Sunday, Dec. 7, Air Transat called the strike notice \"premature given the progress made at the bargaining table\" and said it will respond with an \"action plan\" in which it will start phasing out flights on Dec. 8 and suspend all operations by the end of Dec. 9. In a further statement on the strike and flight cancellations, Air Transat Chief Human Resources and Communications Officer Julie Lamontagne redirected blame toward the union by saying it \"has shown no openness.\" Air Transat is a vacation airline based in Montreal.Shutterstock Air Transat accuses pilot's union of \"indifference,\" prepares to suspend flights \"It is regrettable that the union has expressed such indifference toward Transat, its employees and clients by choosing the path of a strike at this time of year — a reckless decision that does not reflect the state of negotiations,\" Lamontagne said further.

    "fullText": "PepsiCo to cut prices, eliminate products as part of a deal with an activist investor FILE - Plastic bottles of Pepsi are displayed at a grocery store, Nov. 15, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Ted Shaffrey, File) · Associated Press · ASSOCIATED PRESS DEE-ANN DURBIN Mon, December 8, 2025 at 5:36 PM CST 2 min read PEP PepsiCo plans to cut prices and eliminate some of its products under a deal with an activist investor announced Monday. The Purchase, New York-based company, which makes Cheetos, Tostitos and other Frito-Lay products as well as beverages, said it will cut nearly 20% of its product offerings by early next year. PepsiCo said it will use the savings to invest in marketing and improved value for consumers. It didn't disclose which products or how much it would cut prices. PepsiCo said it also plans to accelerate the introduction of new offerings with simpler and more functional ingredients, including Doritos Protein and Simply NKD Cheetos and Doritos, which contain no artificial flavors or colors. The company also recently introduced a prebiotic version of its signature cola. PepsiCo is making the changes after prodding from Elliott Investment Management, which took a $4 billion stake in the company in September. In a letter to PepsiCo’s board, Elliott said the company is being hurt by a lack of strategic clarity, decelerating growth and eroding profitability in its North American food and beverage businesses. In a joint statement with PepsiCo Monday, Elliott Partner Marc Steinberg said the firm is confident that PepsiCo can create value for shareholders as it executes on its new plan. “We appreciate our collaborative engagement with PepsiCo’s management team and the urgency they have demonstrated,” Steinberg said. “We believe the plan announced today to invest in affordability, accelerate innovation and aggressively reduce costs will drive greater revenue and profit growth.” Elliott said it plans to continue working closely with the company. PepsiCo shares were flat in after-hours trading Monday. PepsiCo said it expects organic revenue to grow between 2% and 4% in 2026. The company’s organic revenue rose 1.5%. the first nine months of this year. PepsiCo also said it plans to review its supply chain and continue to make changes to its board, with a focus on global leaders who can help it reach its growth and profitability goals. “We feel encouraged about the actions and initiatives we are implementing with urgency to improve both marketplace and financial performance,” PepsiCo Chairman and CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a statement. PepsiCo said in February that years of double-digit price increases and changing customer preferences have weakened demand for its drinks and snacks. In July, the company said it was trying to combat perceptions that its products are too expensive by expanding distribution of value brands like Chester’s and Santitas.

On Monday, Dec. 8, Miss Universe released a joint statement with Dr. Henry’s family, revealing that her “serious fall” resulted in “an intracranial hemorrhage with loss of consciousness, a fracture, facial lacerations and other significant injuries.” The organization went on to note that Dr. Henry was “immediately admitted to intensive care in Bangkok where she remained in critical condition under constant neurological monitoring and continues to require 24-hour specialist supervision.” Dr. Henry will return to Jamaica in the next few days alongside a “full medical escort team” and will be transferred to a local hospital, the release added. The Miss Universe organization, which noted that it is covering all medical expenses in Thailand for Dr. Henry as well as accommodation and living costs for her family while they stay beside her, additionally shut down rumors suggesting she contributed “in any way” to the fall. “The Miss Universe Organization has never attributed blame to Dr. Henry and confirms that those suggestions are unfounded and do not reflect the facts,” the pageant stated.About Our Ads",

    "description": "Blood type A(B) is caused by a four gene mutations and was discovered when the blood of patients and donors was being studied in a Thai hospital.",
    "fullText": "Scientists Just Found a New Human Blood Type Douglas Sacha - Getty ImagesHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:There are rare blood types beyond the eight most common ones, and researchers have discovered one more that brings the total count to 49.Blood type A(B) is caused by a four gene mutations and was discovered when the blood of patients and donors was being studied in a Thai hospital.Because similar mutations have been known to occur in other contexts, there could be more that are still undiscovered.What’s your sign? What’s your aura? What’s your blood type? While horoscopes and New Age crystals often provide clear answers to the first two questions, the last one on that list can get complicated sometimes.AdvertisementAdvertisementBlood types are identified by antigens—compounds made of sugars and proteins that alert the immune system to the presence of something foreign in the body—and they are the foundation of the ABO blood group system laid out by Karl Landsteiner in 1901. The A antigen has N-acetylgalactosamine as its dominant sugar, the B antigen is dominated by the sugar D-galactose, and type AB blood has both antigens. Type O positive uses a different antigen altogether (known as the rhesus, or Rh, factor), and Type O negative has none of the above. All of this complexity is encoded into proteins by out ABO gene, located on our ninth chromosome.While interesting in and of themselves, antigens become especially important when it comes to donating blood to and receiving blood from others. For blood transfusions to succeed, the antigens of the patient’s blood and the donor’s blood have to match, or else the new blood will be rejected by antibodies in the plasma. This is whytype O negative blood is seen as the universal donor type—because it has neither of the A or B antigens nor the Rh(D) antigen, there is virtually no risk of rejection.But even rarer blood types than O negative exist. There are fifty people on the entire planet with Rh-negative blood, nicknamed “golden blood,” which is completely devoid of Rh antigens. And there is only one individual known to have Gwada negative blood, which was only discovered earlier this year. While O negative is only found in 7% of the global population, researchers who tested the blood of patients and donors in a Thai hospital have now discovered yet another new type that runs through the veins of only three known individuals (it was found in one patient and two donors). What is now recognized as type B(A) has mostly B antigens, but also trace A antigens.“ABO discrepancies were distinct between donors and patients even in the same ethnicity,” the researchers said in a study recently published in the journal Transfusion and Apheresis Science. “This finding highlighted the influence of the patient’s conditions and therapy on the anomalous ABO typing. Additionally, the B(A) individuals identified in this study carried identical genetic alterations that differed from all antecedent alleles of the B(A) phenotype.”AdvertisementAdvertisementThe researchers saw four alleles—alternative forms of certain genes at the same location on a chromosome—on the B(A) type that differed from alleles associated with other blood type and created B(A). Mutations like this had previously been seen in many ethnicities, including individuals from other parts of Asia, but it was the first time such a phenomenon was ever recorded in the Thai population. B(A) adds one more type to the 48 already known to occur in humans.There could be more blood types out there that remain undiscovered, and more individuals with those extremely rare blood types. And the three currently known occurrences of B(A) may not be the only ones in the world. Further research may find more of either, and this discovery is proof that blood typing is not so simple as ABO.You Might Also LikeThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s TapeThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking AnywhereCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?About Our Ads",

    "description": "\"You don't want to mess with a mom python.\"",
    "fullText": "A new TV show is shining a light on just how much damage an invasive snake is doing to Floridian ecosystems.What's happening?ABC's \"Wildlife Nation: Expedition Florida\" examined Burmese pythons in a recent episode. Researchers were able to find an old nest of eggs, where they were able to describe the scene.\"First of all, they're incredibly protective. You don't want to mess with a mom python,\" said host Jeff Corwin.They went on to describe how the snakes, which generally don't produce much of their own heat, actually shiver in order to keep eggs warm and incubate them in a tight clutch. Burmese pythons lay between 12 and 36 eggs every spring.Why are Burmese pythons important?The researchers on the show are quick to highlight that Burmese pythons are a massive problem in Florida. As apex predators, their eggs don't face any serious predators, which allow their young to propagate unopposed.AdvertisementAdvertisementBurmese pythons are considered one of the most (if not the top) invasive species in Florida. They were originally introduced to the wild in the state through the exotic pet trade, and the species has since outcompeted all native animals for vital resources.The result has been a 99% decline in raccoon and opossum populations, and an 88% drop in bobcats. Marsh rabbits, cottontail rabbits, and foxes have disappeared from the state altogether, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.Florida's climate allows the pythons to survive for years, whereas states that have a colder winter would be inhospitable. As average daily temperatures increase around the globe due to pollution, though, the range of areas where Burmese pythons could survive and reproduce could expand farther into the country.The drops in biodiversity caused by invasive species incur a steep loss in ecosystem services. Some studies have suggested that over the course of 50 years, invasive species have created costs of over a trillion dollars globally.What's being done about Burmese pythons?Florida has invested millions in eradicating Burmese pythons. Some partners have been attempting to commercialize the activity by harvesting snakeskins and making finished products with them.AdvertisementAdvertisementIf you're interested in combating invasive species in your area, it's possible to take local action with volunteer groups that work to remove offending fauna and flora, and introduce a greater range of native species.Do you worry about companies drilling too deep into the ground?

    "fullText": "Reid Hoffman said he once spent a night on Epstein's island in connection with MIT fundraising efforts.The LinkedIn cofounder told the Newcomer podcast that he had been told a visit would make Epstein more likely to donate.Hoffman has previously apologized publicly for his interactions with Epstein.LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said he wishes he'd known a little more before agreeing to spend a night on Jeffrey Epstein's island.On the Dec. 1 episode of Eric Newcomer's podcast, Hoffman said that he visited the island as part of his fundraising work for the MIT Foundation and was told the visit would make Epstein more likely to donate to MIT.AdvertisementAdvertisement\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. He said he stayed on the island for one night, and that there was a pool, a \"bunch of guest rooms,\" and a courtyard.Hoffman said he went to the island once.House Oversight CommitteeHoffman has maintained that he only interacted with Epstein, whose 2019 death while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges was ruled a suicide, through his work fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. On the \"Newcomer\" podcast, he called Epstein a \"masterful networker,\" and recalled a 2015 dinner he hosted for an MIT researcher in Palo Alto, California.Hoffman said that Joi Ito, former director of the MIT Media Lab, asked him if Epstein could attend the dinner, which was also attended by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Similar to his visit to the island, Hoffman said he was later told that the financier had said he was more likely to donate if he attended the dinner.\"He's kind of going through the network, trying to meet people and so forth,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. Hoffman also reiterated previous apologies for his involvement with Epstein.AdvertisementAdvertisementIn 2019, a spokesperson for Zuckerberg confirmed the dinner to Business Insider and said it was the only time the Facebook cofounder met Epstein. A spokesperson for Musk also confirmed the Tesla CEO's attendance.In a 2019 email to Axios, Hoffman acknowledged multiple interactions with Epstein, which he said were strictly for fundraising purposes, and said he had been told MIT had vetted and approved the convicted sex offender's participation. He said in the email he was \"deeply regretful\" of the involvement.\"I went and kind of made a, you know, very public apology because it was like, okay I realized this and I'd already at that point had ramped down connection with him, right, to like no meetings and all the rest of the stuff, under any context,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. \"And I think he still would drop me an email every so often and say, 'Hey, can we get on the phone?' I say, 'Oh, maybe sometime,' which is, you know, code for never, right?\"Hoffman said that justice for the late pedophile's victims is important, and urged the government to release, unredacted, \"every single piece of intel that they have about Epstein.\"AdvertisementAdvertisementIn November, President Donald Trump signed a bill that will release the Department of Justice's files on Epstein after months of pressure from Congress, including some fellow Republicans.

AdvertisementAdvertisementTo put that in perspective: Sears once had 3,500 stores, making it the largest retailer in the country.“The company has been on a death spiral for well over a decade,” former Sears executive Mark Cohen told CBS. “It lost sight of the fact that change is a constant.”Still, considering the retailer’s footprint at one time, the idea that just five remain is likely a shock to many Americans of a certain age.Kmart actually purchased Sears in an $11 billion merger back in 2005, but the stores were not able to keep up with the retail competition that came from the likes of Walmart and Amazon. Sears filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and then bought out of that in 2019. The struggles have continued since, though, and the retailer is just hanging on by a thread.AdvertisementAdvertisementFor folks looking for a bit of nostalgia and a trip to the store before it is no more, the final five Sears locations are in Coral Gables, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Braintree, Massachusetts; Concord, California and El Paso, Texas.Read the original article on pennlive.com.About Our Ads",

The community police forces were later formalized by the state, although in some areas they had been infiltrated by criminals.The explosion happened while the state governor, Alfredo Ramírez Bedolla, was participating in a public event with President Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico City to celebrate seven years of government by the ruling Morena party.For two decades, various organized crime groups have fought for control of the territory because Michoacán is a gateway for chemical precursors used in the manufacture of synthetic drugs. They also have another lucrative business: extortion.AdvertisementAdvertisementIn October, Bernardo Bravo, a leader of lime growers in Michoacan, was killed after repeatedly denouncing in recent months the extortion demands of organized crime on producers2025 holiday gift ideas from Techno ClausMarjorie Taylor Greene: The 2025 60 Minutes InterviewThere's a new face in Hollywood, generated by AIAbout Our Ads",

    "fullText": "Microsoft sends harsh message to millions of Microsoft 365 customers Faizan Farooque Mon, December 8, 2025 at 8:03 PM CST 4 min read MSFT Microsoft's stock experienced volatility after some AI sellers made a headline-grabbing claim that the company failed to meet its aggressive goals and, as a result, reset growth targets. Microsoft says the story went too far. It has thus far maintained its double-digit gains this year, but any disruption in its AI narrative could result in significant declines. On a separate but equally important note for investors, it provided dates and amounts for a significant Microsoft 365 price hike that will begin generating revenue in the middle of 2026. If you're keeping score at home, there is a lot of discussion about \"AI quotas\" in the short term and a lot of clarification about ARPU in the medium term. That tension is what MSFT is set up for at the end of the year. Morgan Stanley's 2025 CIO survey report explains, according to Barron's. No one can dispute this. However, it appears that there may be certain areas where a snag could occur, potentially derailing Microsoft's AI ambitions. A Microsoft 365 price hike will begin generating revenue in the middle of 2026.Shutterstock Microsoft AI sales targets and AI quotas collide with early enterprise AI rollouts Several Microsoft sales teams missed aggressive growth goals for Azure Foundry and agentic AI, resulting in resets, according to a report from The Information. The stock price swung due to the speculation. Microsoft responded by asserting that it had not reduced aggregate quotas. This information is crucial for investors who are monitoring demand signals. The bigger picture: \"Agents\" in the early cycle need data plumbing, governance, and change management. Even when budgets are in excellent shape, sales cycles are often longer. The official counterweight: Microsoft 365 prices are rising Microsoft released official information saying that the list prices for Microsoft 365 commercial products will go up on July 1, 2026. The same day, Microsoft 365 Government will also get an update. That's not just a guess; it's from the company. The new grid that many customers are interested in: Business Basic costs $7 per user per month; Business Standard costs $14; Frontline F1 costs $3, and F3 costs $10; Enterprise E3 costs $39, and E5 costs $60. Microsoft linked the lift to more than 1,100 new features, security updates, and built-in AI. What changes for Microsoft customers: Effective date: July 1, 2026, for commercial and government suites. Small-business and frontline tiers: Steeper percentage increases than enterprise tiers. Rationale: Expanded security and management features, plus AI capabilities. New Microsoft list prices at a glance: Business Basic: $7 per user per month Business Standard: $14 Frontline F1/F3: $3/$10 Enterprise E3/E5: $39/$60 Microsoft cloud revenue and ARPU expansion: what the financials say about Microsoft revenue growth Here's why the price change is more important than short-term volatility in shares: Microsoft Cloud made $49.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which was a 26% increase from the same time last year. Remaining performance obligation for businesses: $392 billion, a 51% increase. Segments: Microsoft 365 continued to help Productivity and Business Processes; Azure's Intelligent Cloud helped; Windows and search helped More Personal Computing. The board announced a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, which will be paid on March 12, 2026. It's line-of-sight ARPU, so call it that — a broad price increase that has been in place for a while and is now starting to show up for many customers as fiscal 2027 begins. Microsoft investor insights: How Copilot integration and Azure Foundry tools shape AI-driven growth In the near future, there will be more news stories about the problems that come with using AI. All sellers of \"agents\" are having trouble proving their worth. That's normal for workflow resets, not a drop in demand. More AI Stocks: Is Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so Windows president told ‘Stop this nonsense. No one wants this’ Michael Burry turns up heat on anti-AI bet In the medium term, integrating Copilot into existing Microsoft 365 seats should be a more efficient way to generate revenue than building new agents from scratch. The updated Microsoft 365 projections provide investors with a clearer picture of their potential returns through mid-2026 and fiscal 2027, regardless of the pace of agentic AI adoption. Microsoft KPIs to watch: Penetration of Copilot across the Microsoft 365 user base, which is measured as paid seats relative to active seats. Azure AI usage (workload and usage mix). Before the price increase in July 2026, renewal behavior may include locking in partner rates to maintain low rates. Why the story is still “short-term turbulence vs. long-term monetization” The quota flap makes it clear that agentic AI is not a switch but a multi-quarter adoption curve. But Microsoft gave monetization a deadline that most consumers can't ignore. That's the harsh fact behind the 2026 price change, and it's the portion of the model that doesn't rely on every AI pilot becoming a hero deployment on time.

    "fullText": "FILE PHOTO: A general view of the U.S. Supreme Court building in Washington, U.S. November 10, 2020. REUTERS/Hannah McKay/File PhotoBy Jan WolfeWASHINGTON, Dec 8 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court in a free speech case on Monday opted not to hear an appeal by a group of residents of a rural Texas county of a judicial decision allowing local officials to remove ​17 books that these officials deemed objectionable from public libraries.The justices let stand a lower court's decision allowing the removal of books ‌including ones dealing with themes of race and LGBT identity, from its public library system. The lower court rejected the argument made by the plaintiffs that removing the books was ‌unlawful under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment protections against government abridgment of free speech.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe decision by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals applies to the states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi but does not set a nationwide legal precedent.There has been a surge in book banning in public schools and public libraries in recent years in many locations around the United States, driven by conservative groups and new state laws limiting what kinds of books children ⁠can access.Llano County is a rural area about 80 ‌miles (130 km) from the Texas state capital Austin. The dispute began in 2021 when one faction of local residents asked the Llano County library commissioner to remove the disputed books, which covered topics including transgender issues, race and slavery ‍in the United States, puberty and bodily functions like flatulence.The 17 works at issue include the 1970 book \"In the Night Kitchen\" by acclaimed author Maurice Sendak due to the depiction of its main character, a boy named Mickey, as nude in some of its illustrations as he visits a surreal kitchen in a dream.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe library commission ​ordered librarians to comply with the demands, and residents who pushed for the book removals were appointed to a local county board.A different group ‌of county residents sued to challenge the book ban, alleging their First Amendment rights had been violated.At issue is a First Amendment principle called the right to receive information. The Supreme Court long ago concluded that the First Amendment encompasses a fundamental right to receive information and ideas, as it is necessary for the meaningful exercise of other First Amendment rights such as freedom of religion, expression, speech, assembly and the press.A federal judge in 2023 ordered county officials to restore the disputed books to the library system. But the 5th Circuit in a 10-7 decision reversed the judge's ruling and sided ⁠with the county. The 5th Circuit concluded that public library patrons have no right ​to receive information under the First Amendment.AdvertisementAdvertisementWriting for the 5th Circuit, Judge Stuart Kyle Duncan ​asserted that \"no one is banning\" books by removing them from libraries.More in U.S.Divers Found a Lost Shipwreck So Remarkably Preserved, They Couldn’t Believe Its AgePopular Mechanics106Video of giant snake with unexpected discovery in its stomach sparks outrage: 'Definitely not what we want'The Cool Down106“Jeopardy” champ arrested on charges of felony secret peepingEntertainment WeeklyAlabama: Woman who alleged priest paid her for sex beginning at 17 says there’s ‘no real winner’ after his resignationThe Guardian1.3K\"If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,\" wrote Duncan, a ‍judicial appointee of Republican President Donald Trump. \"All ⁠Llano County has done here is what libraries have been doing for two centuries: decide which books they want in their collections.\"The Supreme Court ruled in a 1982 case that school boards may not remove books because they dislike the ideas contained in those titles. The ⁠justices splintered in their reasoning at that time, leaving the scope of the First Amendment right to receive information unclear.In another case, the Supreme Court in June ruled in favor ‌of Christian and Muslim parents in Maryland who sued to keep their elementary school children out of certain classes when ‌storybooks with LGBT characters are read.(Reporting by Jan Wolfe; Editing by Will Dunham)About Our Ads",

    "fullText": "Divers Couldn’t Believe a Lost Shipwreck’s Age Marcoriveroph - Getty ImagesHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:A Canadian dive team scouring Lake Ontario for a shipwreck discovered far more than they expected.The team was diving to find a 1917 wrecked ship, but instead believe they stumbled on a vessel possibly 100 years older.The two-masted schooner was fully intact—a rarity in Great Lakes shipwreck finds.A team of five divers descended over 300 feet into Lake Ontario’s dark waters near Toronto and found much more than they were dreaming of. In a search for what the team surmised could be a ship lost in 1917, they instead found a shipwreck they believe is possibly 100 years older.AdvertisementAdvertisementThe divers discovered a two-masted schooner sitting upright, with both masts still fully intact, in what the Ontario Underwater Council called an “extraordinary state of preservation for a Great Lakes vessel.” After some preliminary investigation, the team believes the ship may come from an under-documented period of Great Lakes shipbuilding, sometime between 1800 and 1850.“It took us a few moments to calm ourselves down because it’s overwhelming finding a pristine wreck that is all in one piece,” Heison Chak, the president of the Ontario Underwater Council, told the CBC. “It’s got its shape. It hasn’t broken down both masts. We saw two—both masts were standing, which is pretty rare. In all the rest that I have dove, either they have fallen off, because boats come across them, anchors wreck them, [or] divers damage them.”A fiber-optic cable survey of the lake from Buffalo to Toronto alerted experts to an anomaly sitting on the lakebed, leading experts to surmise it could be the Rapid City vessel, an 1884-built schooner lost in 1917.Now, though, they don’t think it can be that recent a wreckage.AdvertisementAdvertisementJames Conolly, Trent University archaeologist and diver, said there were features that just weren’t common for ships built after 1850, a period that experienced a bit of a technological leap for Great Lakes ships. Post-1850s ships had metal rigging, whereas the one found is rope-rigged. “It immediately puts it into, likely, the first half of the 19th century,” Conolly said.Other features were different than what the team was expecting to find, including the ship having no wheel on the aft deck, an early windlass design, and no centerboard winch that became a standard movable keel for Great Lakes ships during the 1850s.While the 1850s may have seen a modern boon for shipbuilding in the Great Lakes, the previous 50 years helped kickstart lake-travel trade, even if the ships built were commonly lost due to storms and mishaps. Much of the history of the era is also lost.“This is deep enough that I don’t think anyone’s been on it,” Chak said. “I think we’re the first group and that joy was just overwhelming.”AdvertisementAdvertisementNot everyone is so readily convinced. Charles Beeker, a Great Lakes shipwreck expert and professor at Indiana University, told the CBC it’s too early to say the vessel is from 1800 to 1850. “I don’t want to diminish the value of it,” he said. “They may be able to identify the vessel, maybe identify the shipyard, and that would be useful to look at an actual intact vessel on the bottom to compare to what little we do have in terms of drawings, and tonnage, and information from these vessels, and the older you go, the less information we have.”More in U.S.Unattended candle sparks $325,000 house fire in North CarolinaLiveNow FoxVideo of giant snake with unexpected discovery in its stomach sparks outrage: 'Definitely not what we want'The Cool Down106“Jeopardy” champ arrested on charges of felony secret peepingEntertainment WeeklyAlabama: Woman who alleged priest paid her for sex beginning at 17 says there’s ‘no real winner’ after his resignationThe Guardian1.3KLayers of invasive quagga mussels cover much of the woodwork, eroding the detailing. “Where a wreck might once have survived intact for centuries,” Conolly said, “we now have only decades to study it before biological and environmental factors take their toll.”The team plans to further explore the wreck, hoping to get more detailed measurements, photography, and wood sampling to pinpoint the ship’s age and history.“We don’t know, but if it is really that era,” Chak said, “from 1800 to 1850, I think we will have even more celebration because we hit the jackpot where there is very little history or studied documented material about shipwrecks, ships, or shipbuilding in that era.”You Might Also LikeThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s TapeThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking AnywhereCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?About Our Ads",

Only employees nominated by their superiors for “exemplary service” were awarded the $10,000 bonus.The TSA employs over 50,000 transportation security officers out of its approximate 65,000 total employees.The DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.About Our Ads",
