    "fullText": "Crystal Palace take on Irish side Shelbourne in the UEFA Conference League at Tallaght Stadium on Thursday evening.\n\nPalace lost 2-1 at Strasbourg, while Shelbourne fell to a 2-0 defeat at AZ Alkmaar in the last matchday.\n\nThis marks the debut campaign for both Shelbourne and Palace in the Conference League and in a major UEFA competition.\n\nShelbourne have lost three and drawn one of their four games in the competition and are the only side yet to score a goal.\n\nHowever, they are just four points behind the last play-off spot, but a defeat to Palace could get them eliminated.\n\nThe Eagles, meanwhile, have fared better than their Irish counterparts, winning two and losing two of their matches so far. They sit 18th in the standings, two points adrift of an automatic qualification spot.\n\nPalace head into this fixture on the back of a dramatic 2-1 victory at Fulham and have now won their last two Premier League games on the road.\n\nOliver Glasner’s side now need to replicate their recent domestic away form to come out victorious in this encounter.\n\nThis is the first-ever competitive meeting between Shelbourne and Palace.\n\nShelbourne are set to miss first-choice goalkeeper Conor Kearns, while Palace are expected to be without Daniel Munoz and Ismaila Sarr for Thursday’s showdown in Ireland.\n\nKerr McInroy: Leads the squad for key passes and tackles per game.\n\nWessel Speel: The goalkeeper has made several key saves in the competition.\n\nMarc Guehi: Scored the winner against Fulham and the Eagles’ best centre-back.\n\nJean-Philippe Mateta: Yet to get off the mark in the competition, but he remains a threat with his physicality.",

    "fullText": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — What’s the secret to winning a seven-a-side tournament when $2 million dollars is on the line?\n\n“Be brave,” San Diego Wave midfielder Gia Corley said after her club won the second World Sevens Football competition on Sunday evening, beating Tigres 3-0 to cap off an impressive campaign. The Wave went undefeated in their ascent to the podium, scoring a total of 14 goals and conceding three. Corley was awarded Breakout Player of the tournament.\n\nHer advice was as simple as the Wave were flamboyant in the latest iteration of the three-day, seven-vs-seven tournament.\n\nFollowing the inaugural event in Portugal this May that featured all European teams, this World Sevens was an exaltation of its greatest strength: the communion of cultures not only across countries but continents, with an invitation to bring their own style of play into close quarters. The Wave play in the National Women’s Soccer League (NWSL) in the U.S., but their World Sevens roster featured players who also represent Germany, Sweden, Brazil, France, Canada, Colombia, and Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\n“If I wanted to play in the Champions League, I’d have to play for a European team. You’re never going to see a U.S. team or South American team play in that format,” said former England Lioness and WSL player Anita Asante, who serves on the World Sevens advisory board, before the start of the tournament.\n\n“Whereas so many more teams can participate and bring their own cultural elements to this experience as well and open up a whole new fanbase and fun experience because now everyone gets to see what it’s like.”\n\n“From South American teams and their style — and the evolution of the playing styles and trends as well that we don’t always get to see because we sometimes get really centered in one sort of format or one place in the world that we’re experiencing the game from,” she continued. “So just opening up that whole lens as well has been really powerful for the players and us.”\n\nSince its inception last year, when Gotham FC minority owner Jennifer Mackesy and her husband, Scott, made a personal commitment to sourcing $100million over five years, World Sevens has been marketed as a service for the social-media-obsessed. Soccer’s typical 90-minute matches have been chopped down to half an hour, the fields are split in two (the World Sevens pitch is roughly half the size of a traditional, FIFA-regulated field ), and there are rolling substitutions and no offside rule.\n\nThere’s an irony to this approach: the tighter parameters result in an abundance of flashy, shareable clips on TikTok and Instagram, but witnessing the tournament in person turns mindless scrolling into a liability. In fact, try to avoid blinking at all during World Sevens altogether — you could miss what makes it special.\n\nTake, for instance, the game-winning goal that Brazilian club Flamengo scored against the NWSL shield-winning Kansas City Current in the tournament’s opening match. Cristiane, a 40-year-old Brazilian forward with two decades of global success, received a ball off a throw-in with her hip and flicked it with her heel to assist Glaucia, who twerked to celebrate the goal.\n\n“It’s a fast-paced game, but it’s my style of game,” Glaucia told The Athletic after that match. “Using my talents of ball control and getting into the game, playing as a team, and just enjoying ourselves.”\n\nFlamengo’s flair wasn’t only in their attack. They were the only team in the competition to occasionally employ an outfield player as their ’keeper when they were hunting for a goal.\n\nWhen they were down 2-1 against AFC Toronto of the newly formed Northern Super League (NSL) with 45 seconds to go on Saturday, defender Monalisa Belem, playing as ’keeper for Vivi Holzel, dribbled the ball into their attacking half and shot a low, driven ball on frame. Toronto were unable to clear it and conceded an equalizer.\n\n“We did what we could,” Holzel said of Monalisa’s keeper swap, a knowing smile spread across her face. “In Brazil, we train a lot in futsal, so they are used to (it).”\n\nFlamengo won that game on penalties, which are played sudden-death style at World Sevens (as opposed to a best-of-five format). After the final whistle, the Brazilian side celebrated as if the $2 million had already hit their bank accounts, spraying their water bottles and dancing with supporters on the sidelines.\n\n“Today we won. We don’t know the next game, so we are enjoying every step to make this happen because the competition is like that,” Holzel said. “We have to enjoy.”\n\nStaying present and loose appears to be another ingredient to the secret sauce of World Sevens.\n\nThe players with standout performances were those for whom World Sevens looked like a return to simpler times, when mistakes were welcomed as opportunities to discover something new, improvisation was rewarded, and personality on the pitch was seen as an enhancement rather than a hindrance.\n\nFew embodied that more than Tigres winger Maria Sanchez, who won the Golden Boot and Golden Ball award with six goals and two assists.\n\n“I grew up playing with boys playing small-sided (games) for hours, so I think a tournament like this suits me very well and it takes me back to my childhood days,” Sanchez said Saturday.\n\nFor others, the fast pace and fluidity required more adjustment, and the film from the first World Sevens and its all-European lineup could only help so much.\n\n“We used a lot of the video for the structure and a little bit of the tactics, but I think we knew this was gonna be a different style of play,” San Diego Wave assistant coach Becki Tweed said of the team’s preparation. “When you see the South American teams play, they’re really smart in how they use their body, they have really good knowledge of space, and I think those are the things that vary a little bit from the European game.”\n\nThe requirements of the small-sided tournament also enlightened the coaching staff to their own roster. “Which is fun, because you think you know them until you put them in a new challenge,” Tweed added.\n\nThe format also exposed some teams that struggled to loosen up on the pitch. The Current, despite their superlative season in the NWSL, failed to advance from the group stage against Flamengo, Toronto, and Tigres. Star players like league MVP Temwa Chawinga, Michelle Cooper, and Claire Hutton were absent either due to injury or the need for rest, and were replaced by academy players.\n\nThe World Sevens organizers built off the success of their first event earlier this year, but they also had to account for key differences.\n\nIn May, the competition took place in Estoril, Portugal, in the days leading up to the Champions League final just 30 minutes away in Lisbon. Fans needed only to extend their trip by a few days to enjoy both. This time around, not only was World Sevens without the proximity of a major competition to drum up support and publicity, but it wound up competing with Art Basel in Miami and Inter Miami’s MLS Cup final (which they hosted) for attention that weekend. Attendance on Friday was scant but peaked on Saturday when each team played twice.\n\nIn the first edition, the fan zone and field were in two different places, preventing an easy flow of traffic between matches. That issue was resolved at Beyond Bancard Stadium, but the foosball tables, sign-making stations, and World Sevens-branded claw machines were lonely throughout the weekend as many of the kids in attendance were competing in the Rising Sevens youth tournament behind the stadium.\n\nBut for whatever World Sevens Football lost in the marketing department, it recovered in the passion that emanated across Beyond Bancard stadium in Fort Lauderdale from those who did show up. Deportivo Cali supporters saved the weekend. Dozens traveled from across Florida, the U.S., and even Colombia just to support their team. Clad in green and white, they flooded the stadium and filled it with percussion, chants, and songs, often drowning out the music coming out of the speakers from the DJ booth.\n\n“We’re going to make them feel like home, like this is home,” said Jose Luis, 40, who traveled to Fort Lauderdale from Cali, Colombia. “That’s why you see us shouting. I have no voice anymore. That’s our purpose. It’s 35 minutes.”\n\nCali narrowly missed a place in the knockout stage with a 1-0 loss to Club America, but midfielder Kelly Ibarguen told The Athletic on Saturday following their victory over Uruguayan side Nacional that they felt the energy of their supporters on the pitch.\n\n“We always approach things with great joy and happiness, and having the fans behind us is truly a source of pride for us. They’ve supported us in Argentina in every tournament we’ve played in,” she said.\n\nThe prize money sweetened the experience, and this time all teams brought something home.\n\nThe Wave claimed $2 million, Tigres earned $1 as finalists, and Club America were awarded $700,000 as the third place team. Flamengo, who came in fourth, got $500,000, and the remaining four teams were given $200,000 each.\n\nMoney is always nice, and earning large sums for two or three days of work is a rare opportunity in the women’s game. But U.S. women’s national team legend and player advisory board member Tobin Heath is looking even further at what World Sevens is building.\n\n“Life is about mirroring,” Heath said. “That, to me, is how women’s football has been developed. It’s been developed around every single men’s competition, then the women’s competition follows. And what has happened because of that is our culture, women’s football culture, has been completely eliminated when it comes to actually showcasing our uniqueness in the market of sports. Because we just act like the version of football that we’re playing in, this is the first time that there’s nothing for us to mirror against.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in The Athletic.\n\nKansas City Current, San Diego Wave, NWSL, Women's Soccer\n\n2025 The Athletic Media Company",

    "fullText": "Indiana quarterback Fernando Mendoza, Ohio State QB Julian Sayin, Vanderbilt quarterback Diego Pavia and Notre Dame running back Jeremiyah Love are headed to New York City for the Heisman Trophy presentation.\n\nHere’s a look at all four players through the recruiting process:\n\nAn industry three-star quarterback, Mendoza was originally committed to Yale but got a late offer from Cal and took it. The Miami (Fla.) Columbus prospect didn’t have an exceptional senior year of high school, either, throwing for just about 1,100 yards and 11 touchdowns.\n\nHe redshirted in Berkeley in 2022 and was the backup for the first half of the 2023 season until getting his first opportunity in Week 6 against Oregon State and never looking back.\n\nAfter throwing for 3,000 yards and 16 touchdowns in 2024, Mendoza hit the transfer portal and has starred at Indiana this season leading the Hoosiers to an undefeated regular season and then beating Ohio State in the Big 10 championship.\n\nIf Justyn Martin from Inglewood, Calif., did not de-commit from the Golden Bears in late September, one wonders if Mendoza would have ever been offered by Cal at all – and whether Yale would have had a Heisman frontrunner on its hands.\n\nRated as the second-best quarterback behind only Florida’s DJ Lagway as a five-star prospect, Sayin committed to Alabama over Georgia and LSU as Michigan, Notre Dame and others were involved earlier but the Carlsbad, Calif., standout shied away from playing in the cold weather.\n\nPlaying for coach Nick Saban – and offensive coordinator Bill O’Brien – were huge draws for Sayin to pick the Crimson Tide but a few short weeks after arriving in Tuscaloosa, Saban retired and O’Brien left for Boston College.\n\nThen-Washington coach Kalen DeBoer got the Alabama job and according to the book The Price: What it Takes to Win in College Football’s Era of Chaos, the new Crimson Tide coach made Sayin wait to meet him and then acted like he didn’t know who he was during the short meeting.\n\nThe former five-star transferred to Ohio State, sat behind Will Howard last season as the Buckeyes won the national championship and then Sayin won the starting job leading Ohio State to the No. 2 overall ranking in the College Football Playoff.\n\nSo far this season, Sayin has thrown for 3,323 yards with 31 touchdowns and six interceptions.\n\nA three-star junior college prospect at New Mexico Military Institute, Pavia then transferred to New Mexico State where in 2023 he led the Aggies to a shocking 31-10 win at Auburn and emerged as one of the hottest quarterbacks in the transfer portal after that season.\n\nAfter two seasons at New Mexico State, Pavia has now spent two seasons at Vanderbilt and the Commodores at 10-2 have their first double-digit winning season in program history dating back to 1902.\n\nPavia in many ways has taken the college football world by storm over the last two years and he also had at least a part – either by publicly talking about him or showing what Vanderbilt football is capable of – of landing five-star quarterback Jared Curtis, who flipped from Georgia around National Signing Day.\n\nHe’s thrown for 2,924 yards with 26 touchdowns and six picks this season and also leads the Commodores with 661 rushing yards and eight TDs.\n\nRanked as the fifth-best running back in the 2023 class, Love chose Notre Dame over Alabama, Michigan, Texas A&M, Oregon and others midway through his senior season.\n\nAt the time of his pledge, the Irish also had running back pledges from Dylan Edwards, who has had a wild recruitment and college career of changing schools, along with Jayden Limar.\n\nThe Christian Brothers standout was the second St. Louis standout who was in that Notre Dame class along with four-star DB Christian Gray who played at De Smet.\n\nLove has rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of the last two seasons and would be the first running back to win the Heisman Trophy since Derrick Henry in 2015. The former four-star has rushed for 1,372 yards and 18 touchdowns this season and those will be his final stats since the Irish turned down a bowl game bid.",

    "description": "Eagles star melted down vs. Chargers.",
    "fullText": "Eagles quarterback Jalen Hurts threw four interceptions in Monday night’s 22-19 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Chargers, but star wideout A.J. Brown shares the blame for the offense’s struggles.\n\nBrown dropped a potential game-winning touchdown on the last drive of the fourth quarter at SoFi Stadium. He bobbled a pass over the middle that turned into an interception with 11:03 remaining in the game and let a deep ball slip out of his hands on the opening drive of the first quarter. If he had made those plays, the Eagles might have beaten the Chargers instead of falling to 8-5.\n\n“That one hurt,” Brown said about dropping a touchdown. “I’m more than capable of making those plays, and Jalen trusts me in any situation. I made some plays, but I wasn’t great when it mattered.”\n\n“That is just going to be another tough one,” Brown said about dropping the pass that resulted in an interception. “I’m more than capable of making that grab for him. Jalen was... He stepped up in the pocket. He was under pressure. So like I said, I’m more than capable of making that one for him, man. That one hurt.”\n\nBrown, who made six catches (on 13 targets) for 100 yards, has spent most of the season frustrated with his role in Philadelphia’s offense and with the passing game’s overall lack of production. Among NFL wide receivers, he is tied for 17th in catches (62), ranks 20th in receiving yards (799) and is tied for 11th in touchdowns (6six).\n\nBut the three-time All-Pro wide receiver was a big part of the problem on Monday night, and this time, he can only blame himself.\n\nBrown caught two passes that set up Philadelphia’s offense at Los Angeles’ 25-yard line with 2:33 left in the fourth quarter. Two plays later, he beat Chargers cornerback Cam Hart to the back corner of the end zone, but Hurts’ pass slipped through his hands as Hart knocked his arm down.\n\nHart has developed into a solid player in his second season, but as one of the league’s highest-paid receivers, Brown is expected to win those matchups against younger cornerbacks.\n\nThe Eagles would have won with a touchdown, but they settled for a field goal and took only a three-point lead (19-16). On the next drive, they gave up three points to the Chargers, who sent the game to overtime.\n\nOn Hurts’ third interception, Brown again got past Hart, but the pass slipped through his hands and into the cornerback’s arms. Hart returned it 27 yards to the Eagles’ 35, setting up a field goal that tied the game at 16.\n\nBrown also beat Chargers cornerback Tarheeb Still deep down the field on the first play of the game, but Hurts’ pass rolled off his fingers.\n\nOn a contested deep ball in overtime, Brown was unable to create separation on Chargers cornerback Donte Jackson and the pass sailed incomplete.\n\n“Yeah, cause I pride myself on making them tough catches,” Brown said when asked if this is the worst he’s felt after a loss this season. “Even the one in overtime. I was running out of bounds and I’m trying to get one hand on it. I’m more than capable of making all those catches. I pride myself on that.”\n\nHe has gone over 100 yards in three straight games, and the Eagles have lost all those games.\n\n“It’s going to be flushed because you have to,” Brown said about his mindset after the loss. “It’s a part of the game. It’s a part of playing at a high level. I’m catching 500 balls a day. I pride myself on making the catch. I gotta go back to work. That’s just what it is.”\n\nBrown also ruined a few plays against the Chargers with poor blocking, most notably when he missed his block on Still, leaving Eagles receiver DeVonta Smith unblocked on a perimeter screen.\n\n“I could go out there and drop a hundred balls, and I am still going to believe in me, believe in my hands,” Brown said. “I believe I got the best hands in the world. But again, sometimes it doesn’t go your way, and that’s a part of it. You gotta have thick skin and you go back to work and do my same routine every single day, catching my balls.”",

    "fullText": "Mason Mount looks to have pushed his injury woes behind him at Manchester United and continued his impressive season against Wolves on Monday.\n\nThe 26-year-old's sweet strike in the 4-1 win, combining with Bruno Fernandes again, was his third goal in four starts.\n\nHe also opened the scoring in a 2-0 victory over Sunderland and bagged the winner in United's 2-1 triumph at Crystal Palace.\n\nBut Mount's performance against Wolves was undoubtedly his best since completing his £55m transfer from Chelsea in 2023. It was a joy to watch.\n\nSharpness on the ball, neat touches to evade danger and pinpoint passes to keep United flowing acted as a technical showreel of what he can offer.\n\nMount's relentless work-rate off the ball also makes it no surprise that Ruben Amorim \"loves\" him so dearly.\n\nAmorim has been careful with the number seven's workload this season after two injury-plagued first years at Old Trafford.\n\nMount has only started two of United's past seven games and is ranked 13th in the squad for minutes played (584).\n\nHowever, when called upon, he often takes his chance to shine. With Bryan Mbeumo and Amad Diallo heading off to Afcaon after Monday's match against Bournemouth, Mount is about to become even more important.\n\nIt represents a glorious chance for Mount to catch the attention of Thomas Tuchel, who loved him just as much as Amorim when the pair lifted the Champions League together at Chelsea.\n\nHe also operated as the left-sided 10 in a 3-4-3 under Tuchel and is now channelling the Mount of old in Manchester red.\n\nThe former Blues midfielder is a huge outsider for England's World Cup squad, but he will play himself into contention if he maintains his fitness and level of performance.\n\nFind more from Alex Turk at Turk Talks FC",

Add The Sporting News as a Preferred Source by clicking here.\n\nSince the summer, there's been speculation about whether LeBron James will play the entire 2025-26 NBA season with the Los Angeles Lakers.\n\nA statement by his agent, Rich Paul, after James opted into his player option seemed to raise the possibility of wanting a trade if certain things didn't go his way.\n\nBut the reality was always going to be more complicated. What would a trade for a 40-year old James look like?\n\nIt doesn't appear we'll get to find out.\n\nPaul joined Max Kellerman for an interview recently and affirmed that James isn't going anywhere.\n\n“No,\" Paul said to the idea of James being traded. \"Where’s he gonna go? Does LeBron make the Knicks better? Yes he would, of course but 29 other teams would say the same thing.\"\n\nMORE: NBA reveals fine for Desmond Bane throwing the ball at OG Anunoby\n\nThe Lakers, at least when healthy, seem to have a chance of being a strong contender this season.\n\nLuka Doncic and Austin Reaves are both playing as well as they ever have.

    "fullText": "Sam Eng/Devolver Digital, PC, PS5, Switch 2\nAn exquisitely fluid game of tricks, grinds and manuals is framed by a story that uncovers the poignancy of the infamously painful pastime\n\nSkateboarding video games live and die by their vibe. The original Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater titles were anarchic, arcade fun while the recent return of EA’s beloved Skate franchise offered competent yet jarringly corporate realism. Skate Story, which is mostly the work of solo developer Sam Eng, offers a more impressionistic interpretation while capturing something of the sport’s essential spirit. It transposes the boarding action to a demonic underworld where the aesthetic is less fire and brimstone than glittering, 2010s-era vaporwave. It is also the most emotionally real a skateboarding game has ever felt.\n\nThe premise is ingenious: you are a demon made out of “pain and glass”. Skate to the moon and swallow it, says the devil, and you shall be freed. So that is exactly what you do. You learn to ollie first, a “delicate, precise trick” according to the artfully written in-game text. Then come the pop shuvit, kickflip, heelflip and more.\n\nThe controls are easy: one button to ollie. If you’re holding down a shoulder button at the same time, you perform a more involved trick. Beyond the ravishing visuals, what’s most striking is the exquisite fluidity, the delicious “gamefeel”, of the actual skateboarding: the way the knees of this glittering demon bend just the right amount after landing a trick; the way you can see their foot stretching out across the top end of the board in order to apply just the right force that will cause it to flip.\n\nThe vaporwave aesthetic is not Skate Story’s only bold design choice. You will fall many times on the ghoulish asphalt and when you do the action cuts to first-person, causing you to see the world tumbling for what feels like a tormenting eternity. Along the way, you meet a bizarre cast of characters: a mystical rabbit, a pigeon trying to type a screenplay, and a ghost hanging out in a launderette.\n\nThe game’s action can be divided into two types: narrow, linear tunnels that you hurtle through at breakneck speed, and wide-open sandbox levels. The former are furious, momentum-filled thrill rides that demand utmost precision; the latter, set in nightmarish, nocturnal visions of New York, feature many offbeat objectives, such as chasing spooky laundry. In these levels, there is ample room to enjoy the deceptively deep skating mechanics.\n\nGradually, a melancholy surfaces in this crystalline universe. Of course, the skateboarder wants to be free of the underworld, but they also seem enraptured by the idea of devouring these moons. As you thread together tricks with manuals and grinds, scoring ever-larger combos, all as a brilliantly downbeat electro soundtrack chimes away, questions arise. Why is this skateboarder so hungry? Why do they seek pain? In some ways, we’re reminded of the physical risks of skateboarding in real life.\n\nThese questions – and the sadness buried within their answers – distinguish Skate Story from its traditionally zany video game counterparts. Rather, Eng’s gently emotive work is \n\nThe result is a skateboarding game of rare poetry. There is the poetry of the skating itself, the miraculous interplay of body and board rendered with aplomb. There is the actual poetry that accompanies the end of each level. Finally, there are the tender emotions that refract through, and seem amplified by every bailed kickflip in this surreal, shimmering take on hell.",

    "fullText": "Commerce department finalising deal to allow H200 chips to be sold to China as strict Biden-era restrictions relaxed\n\nDonald Trump has cleared the way for Nvidia to begin selling its powerful AI computer chips to China, marking a win for the chip maker and its CEO, Jensen Huang, who has spent months lobbying the White House to open up sales in the country.\n\nBefore Monday’s announcement, the US had prohibited sales of Nvidia’s most advanced chips to China over national security concerns.\n\nTrump posted to Truth Social on Monday: “I have informed President Xi, of China, that the United States will allow NVIDIA to ship its H200 products to approved customers in China, and other Countries, under conditions that allow for continued strong National Security. President Xi responded positively!”\n\nTrump said the Department of Commerce was finalising the details and that he was planning to make the same offer to other chip companies, including Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and Intel. Nvidia’s H200 chips are the company’s second most powerful, and far more advanced than the H20, which was originally designed as a lower-powered model for the Chinese market that would not breach restrictions, but which the US banned anyway in April.\n\nThe president said the US would receive 25% of the proceeds, more than the 15% previously agreed to with Nvidia in an earlier deal to lift restrictions, and following similar unorthodox plans for the federal government to take a financial cut from private business dealings.\n\nIn August, Trump said the US would receive a 10% stake in the tech company Intel. Some lawmakers have questioned the legality of such arrangements.\n\nAccording to the Hill, the Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Andy Kim of New Jersey sent letters to the commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick, last week outlining their concerns over selling these chips to China and saying it risked powering the country’s “surveillance, censorship and military applications”.\n\nThey wrote: “I urge you to stop ignoring the input of bipartisan members of Congress and your own experts in order to cut deals that trade away America’s national security.”\n\nOn social media, Warren called for Huang to appear before Congress to testify under oath.\n\nHuang has worked closely with Trump since the inauguration and has made several trips to the White House. The CEO attended the president’s AI summit in July, met Trump as recently as last week and was even a guest at the White House dinner for the Saudi crown price, Mohammed bin Salman. Huang has pledged to invest $500bn in AI infrastructure in the US over the next four years.\n\nHuang has visited China several times, meeting officials and Chinese tech executives, as US bans were variously lifted and reintroduced. Earlier this year, China imposed its own controls on the imports of Nvidia chips, with top tech firms reportedly instructed to cancel orders, citing national security concerns and confidence in China’s domestic chip development.\n\nIn October, Huang said Nvidia has gone from having 95% of the Chinese market to having none, and called the bans a “strategic mistake”.\n\nSelling chips to China, the world’s second largest economy, could now mean a windfall worth billions of dollars for Nvidia, which is already valued at $4.5tn.\n\nAn Nvidia spokesperson said: “We applaud President Trump’s decision.” He said offering the H200 chips “to approved commercial customers, vetted by the Department of Commerce, strikes a thoughtful balance that is great for America”.\n\nThe Nvidia spokesperson and Trump said the move would support US jobs and manufacturing.\n\nIn his Truth Social post, Trump condemned the Biden administration’s policies, which imposed strict export controls on powerful chips. The Biden administration had said withholding such technology from China bolstered US competition, protected national security and hampered AI development in China.\n\n“That Era is OVER!” Trump wrote. “My Administration will always put America FIRST.”\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, China’s foreign ministry said it had noted the reports. “China has always adhered to the principle that China and the United States can achieve mutual benefit and win-win results through cooperation,” the spokesperson said.\n\nMa Jihua, a telecom industry analyst, told the state media outlet the Global Times that years of US curbs on AI exports had “provided a rare chance of China’s domestic chip industry to grow and catch up”.",

    "fullText": "European Commission to assess whether Gemini owner is putting rival companies at a disadvantage\n\nThe EU has opened an investigation to assess whether Google is breaching European competition rules in its use of online content from publishers and YouTube creators for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe European Commission said on Tuesday it will examine whether the US tech company, which runs the Gemini AI model and is owned by Alphabet, is putting rival AI owners at a “disadvantage”.\n\n“The investigation will notably examine whether Google is distorting competition by imposing unfair terms and conditions on publishers and content creators, or by granting itself privileged access to such content, thereby placing developers of rival AI models at a disadvantage,” the commission said.\n\nIt said it was concerned that Google may have used content from web publishers to generate AI-powered services on its search results pages without appropriate compensation to publishers and without offering them the possibility to refuse such use of their content.\n\nThe commission said it was also concerned as to whether Google has used content uploaded to YouTube to train its own generative AI models without offering creators compensation or the possibility to refuse.\n\n“Content creators uploading videos on YouTube have an obligation to grant Google permission to use their data for different purposes, including for training generative AI models,” the commission said.\n\nGoogle does not pay YouTube content creators for their content, nor does it allow them to upload their content on YouTube without allowing Google to use such data, it said. The commission noted that rival developers of AI models are barred by YouTube policies from using YouTube content to train their own AI models.\n\nGoogle-owned YouTube says its terms and conditions allow Google to use creators’ work for making AI models. In September, YouTube said: “We use content uploaded to YouTube to improve the product experience for creators and viewers across YouTube and Google, including through machine learning and AI applications.”\n\nThe EU’s competition chief, Teresa Ribera, said: “AI is bringing remarkable innovation and many benefits for people and businesses across Europe, but this progress cannot come at the expense of the principles at the heart of our societies.”\n\nA spokesperson for Google said: “This complaint risks stifling innovation in a market that is more competitive than ever.\n\n“Europeans deserve to benefit from the latest technologies and we will continue to work closely with the news and creative industries as they transition to the AI era.”\n\nThe EU’s investigation is the latest in a series of challenges to US big tech companies in recent years.\n\nIn September, EU regulators issued a fine of almost €3bn (£2.6bn) against Google, claiming that it favoured its own digital advertising services over rivals. Donald Trump said the fine was “discriminatory”.\n\nElon Musk’s social media company X, formerly known as Twitter, was fined €120m by EU tech regulators last week for breaching online content rules. The breaches included what the EU said was a “deceptive” blue tick verification badge given to users and the lack of transparency of the platform’s advertising.\n\nThe fine also attracted criticism from US officials, including the secretary of state Marco Rubio, who wrote on X that the fine was “an attack on all American tech platforms and the American people by foreign governments”.\n\nThe European Commission opened an investigation earlier this year into Meta over its rollout of AI features on WhatsApp, its messaging platform. Last year it fined Meta €798m for abusive practices benefiting Facebook Marketplace.\n\nIn 2024, Apple lost a fight against an order by EU competition regulators to pay €13bn in back taxes to Ireland.\n\nLast month, the head of Google’s parent company said people should not “blindly trust” everything AI tools tell them.\n\nSundar Pichai, the chief executive of Alphabet, said AI models were “prone to errors” and urged people to use them alongside other tools. He also warned that no company would be immune if the AI bubble burst.",

    "fullText": "Accounts held by users under 16 must be removed on apps that include TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and Threads under ban\n\nHow is Australia’s social media ban affecting you and your family?\n\nGet our breaking news email, free app or daily news podcast\n\nAustralia has enacted a world-first ban on social media for users aged under 16, causing millions of children and teenagers to lose access to their accounts.\n\nFacebook, Instagram, Threads, X, YouTube, Snapchat, Reddit, Kick, Twitch and TikTok are expected to have taken steps from Wednesday to remove accounts held by users under 16 years of age in Australia, and prevent those teens from registering new accounts.\n\nPlatforms that do not comply risk fines of up to $49.5m.\n\nThere have been some teething problems with the ban’s implementation. Guardian Australia has received several reports of those under 16 passing the facial age assurance tests, but the government has flagged it is not expecting the ban will be perfect from day one.\n\nAll listed platforms apart from X had confirmed by Tuesday they would comply with the ban. The eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, said it had recently had a conversation with X about how it would comply, but the company had not communicated its policy to users.\n\nBluesky, an X alternative, announced on Tuesday it would also ban under-16s, despite eSafety assessing the platform as “low risk” due to its small user base of 50,000 in Australia.\n\nChildren had spent the past few weeks undertaking age assurance checks, swapping phone numbers and preparing for their accounts to be deactivated.\n\nThe Australian chief executive and co-founder of the age assurance service k-ID, Kieran Donovan, said his service had conducted hundreds of thousands of age checks in the past few weeks. The k-ID service was being used by Snapchat among others.\n\nParents of children affected by the ban shared a spectrum of views on the policy. One parent told the Guardian their 15-year-old daughter was “very distressed” because “all her 14 to 15-year-old friends have been age verified as 18 by Snapchat”. Since she had been identified as under 16, they feared “her friends will keep using Snapchat to talk and organise social events and she will be left out”.\n\nAnother parent said the ban had forced him to teach his child how to break the law. “I’ve shown her how VPNs work and other methods on bypassing age restrictions,” he said. “I’ve had to set her up with her own adult YouTube account and have assisted her in bypassing TikTok’s age-estimation and will keep doing so each time it asks.”\n\nOthers said the ban “can’t come quickly enough”. One parent said their daughter was “completely addicted” to social media and the ban “provides us with a support framework to keep her off these platforms”.\n\nThe Australian prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said in an opinion piece on Sunday: “From the beginning, we’ve acknowledged this process won’t be 100% perfect. But the message this law sends will be 100% clear … Australia sets the legal drinking age at 18 because our society recognises the ­benefits to the individual and the community of such an ­approach.\n\n“The fact that teenagers occasionally find a way to have a drink doesn’t diminish the value of having a clear, ­national standard.”\n\nPolling has consistently shown that two-thirds of voters support raising the minimum age for social media to 16. The opposition, including leader Sussan Ley, have recently voiced alarm about the ban, despite waving the legislation through parliament and the former Liberal leader Peter Dutton championing it.\n\nThe ban has garnered worldwide attention, with several nations indicating they will adopt a ban of their own, including Malaysia, Denmark and Norway. The European Union passed a resolution to adopt similar restrictions, while a spokesperson for the British government told Reuters it was “closely monitoring Australia’s approach to age restrictions”.\n\nInman Grant told the Guardian that from Thursday, she would be sending notices to the platforms covered by the ban to find out how the implementation was progressing.\n\nQuestions included “how many accounts [they’ve] deactivated or removed, what challenges they’re finding, how they’re preventing recidivism and preventing circumvention, whether or not their abuse or reporting abuse and the appeals processes are working as planned”, she said.\n\nAlbanese said the information gathered in this process would be made public.\n\nThe regulator would need to assess whether platforms were taking reasonable steps. If they were not, it could take that platform to court to seek fines.\n\nThere would be an independent evaluation of the ban conducted by an academic advisory group examining the short-term, medium-term and longer-term impacts of the ban.\n\n“It will look at the benefits over time, but also the unintended consequences,” Inman Grant said.\n\n“Everything from are sleeping? Are they interacting or are they actually getting out on the sports fields? Are they reading books? Are they taking less medication like antidepressants? Are their Naplan scores improving over time?” Inman Grant said.\n\nPotential unintended consequences to be investigated included whether children were moving on to “darker areas of the internet”, learning how to bypass the bans through VPNs, or moving on to other platforms, she said.\n\nTeens on Snapchat affected by the ban had been publicly sharing their mobile numbers in their profiles ahead of their accounts being shut down.\n\nA spokesperson for Snapchat said the platform understood under-16s were disappointed by the ban but “would strongly encourage any teens using Snapchat not to publicly share their personal contact information”.\n\nInman Grant said she had sent notices to 15 companies not initially included in the ban, asking them to self-assess whether they should be.\n\nYope and Lemon8, which shot up the app store rankings as teens looked for alternatives, were among those contacted.",

    "fullText": "Experts warn of dangers as England and Wales study shows 13- to 17-year-olds consulting AI amid long waiting lists for services\n\nIt was after one friend was shot and another stabbed, both fatally, that Shan asked ChatGPT for help. She had tried conventional mental health services but “chat”, as she came to know her AI “friend”, felt safer, less intimidating and, crucially, more available when it came to handling the trauma from the deaths of her young friends.\n\nAs she started consulting the AI model, the Tottenham teenager joined about 40% of 13- to 17-year-olds in England and Wales affected by youth violence who are turning to AI chatbots for mental health support, according to research among more than 11,000 young people.\n\nIt found that both victims and perpetrators of violence were markedly more likely to be using AI for such support than other teenagers. The findings, from the Youth Endowment Fund, have sparked warnings from youth leaders that children at risk “need a human not a bot”.\n\nThe results suggest chatbots are fulfilling demand unmet by conventional mental health services, which have long waiting lists and which some young users find lacking in empathy. The supposed privacy of the chatbot is another key factor in driving use by victims or perpetrators of crimes.\n\nAfter her friends were killed Shan, 18, not her real name, started using Snapchat’s AI before switching to ChatGPT, which she can talk to at any time of day or night with two clicks on her smartphone.\n\n“I feel like it definitely is a friend,” she said, adding that it was less intimidating, more private and less judgmental than her experience with conventional NHS and charity mental health support.\n\n“The more you talk to it like a friend it will be talking to you like a friend back. If I say to chat ‘Hey bestie, I need some advice’. Chat will talk back to me like it’s my best friend, she’ll say, ‘Hey bestie, I got you girl’.”\n\nOne in four of 13- to 17-year-olds have used an AI chatbot for mental health support in the past year, with black children twice as likely as white children to have done so, the study found. Teenagers were more likely to go online for support, including using AI, if they were on a waiting list for treatment or diagnosis or had been denied, than if they were already receiving in-person support.\n\nCrucially, Shan said, the AI was “accessible 24/7” and would not tell teachers or parents about what she had disclosed. She felt this was a considerable advantage over telling a school therapist, after her own experience of what she thought were confidences being shared with teachers and her mother.\n\nBoys who were involved in gang activities felt safer asking chatbots for advice about other safer ways to make money than a teacher or parent who might leak the information to police or other gang members, putting them in danger, she said.\n\nAnother young person, who has been using AI for mental health support but asked not to be named, told the Guardian: “The current system is so broken for offering help for young people. Chatbots provide immediate answers. If you’re going to be on the waiting list for one to two years to get anything, or you can have an immediate answer within a few minutes … that’s where the desire to use AI comes from.”\n\nJon Yates, the chief executive of the Youth Endowment Fund, which commissioned the research, said: “Too many young people are struggling with their mental health and can’t get the support they need. It’s no surprise that some are turning to technology for help. We have to do better for our children, especially those most at risk. They need a human not a bot.”\n\nThere have been growing concerns about the dangers of chatbots when children engage with them at length. OpenAI, the US company behind ChatGPT, is facing several lawsuits including from families of young people who have killed themselves after long engagements.\n\nIn the case of the Californian 16-year-old Adam Raine, who took his life in April, OpenAI has denied it was caused by the chatbot. It has said it has been improving its technology “to recognise and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress, de-escalate conversations, and guide people toward real-world support.”. The startup said in September it could start contacting authorities in cases where users start talking seriously about suicide.\n\nHanna Jones, a youth violence and mental health researcher in London, said: “To have this tool that could tell you technically anything – it’s almost like a fairytale. You’ve got this magic book that can solve all your problems. That sounds incredible.”\n\nBut she is worried about the lack of regulation.\n\n“People are using ChatGPT for mental health support, when it’s not designed for that,” she said. “What we need now is to increase regulations that are evidence-backed but also youth-led. This is not going to be solved by adults making decisions for young people. Young people need to be in the driving seat to make decisions around ChatGPT and mental health support that uses AI, because it’s so different to our world. We didn’t grow up with this. We can’t even imagine what it is to be a young person today.”",

    "description": "On Thursday 18th December 2025, I will be going live on Twitch for the last time. I guess this time the game really does stop, when the stream ends.",
    "fullText": "A lot has happened since Wednesday 24th June 2020: the day I went live on Twitch for the first time. That was the day I thrust myself upon The Internet and seemingly changed the trajectory of my career, which has taken me to places and introduced me to people I could never even have imagined.\n\nI remember my first stream like it was yesterday. After I pressed the go live button, I remember going back and forth between my makeshift pandemic office upstairs and the lounge downstairs to make sure I was, indeed, broadcasting to the world. (I hadn't yet discovered the Twitch dashboard that lets you monitor your stream in real time.) That first stream had just an average of three viewers, and mainly consisted of counselling a Lithuanian 17-year old who was having trouble with his parents whilst I was building my first open source app: fretonator.com. I often wonder if he's doing OK now.\n\nDespite the strange start to this streaming journey, I was hooked instantly. During the height of the early Covid pandemic panic, before the vaccine was invented, whilst millions of people were dying, as we were all adjusting to remote working in our homes, and whilst my child was just two and a half years old, somehow I found the time and inclination to go live on Twitch four evenings a week consistently. Honestly, I don't know how I did it. But at the time, everyone was on Twitch; it was addictive. Being on The Internet felt like a necessity in the early days of the pandemic, and being part of a live stream hosted by a real person on Twitch was uplifting in an otherwise dire set of circumstances. It was how we stayed connected when we figured we all could just die at any time. And, through streaming and watching others on Twitch I had discovered an incredible community with shared interests who all just simply enjoyed hanging out with each other. It was a truly, truly wonderful time in my life in an otherwise dark, dark time for the planet.\n\nBefore Twitch, I was living in a tiny world, working at a local tech agency in Manchester, UK. I had not yet heard of niche sub-categories of the technology industry such as Developer Relations, Developer Advocacy, Developer Experience, or Developer Education. At the time, given that people in these job roles were no longer travelling to events, they had moved their activities to Twitch. By immersing myself in what was then the Science and Technology category on Twitch, and the wonderful mechanics of Twitch raids (where you send all your viewers to another stream when you're ready to go offline), I came to know many people who were working in DevRel, and was entirely enamoured with the whole thing.\n\nI got my first Developer Advocacy job after I got to know a streamer I raided who was a Developer Advocate at the time, LaylaCodesIt. I remember choosing to raid her because she was the only other British woman I witnessed streaming in the Science and Technology category since I discovered Twitch. We became fast friends, we streamed together in a little series we called CodeCake, and she referred me to an ex-colleague of hers who was hiring a front-end specialist Developer Advocate at Contentful. I remember thinking that this type of job was too good to be true. How could it be possible that I could use my expertise in teaching and skills in technology in the same job? (For those of you that don't know my history, I was a music teacher before I started working in tech.) And so in January 2021, the next chapter of my journey began.\n\nStreaming was a big part of my DevRel job at Contentful; I would go live three times a week during work hours consistently. In fact, I got invited to the Twitch Partner program during my time at Contentful, which I attribute to being able to have so much freedom to stream and talk about Contentful in public as part of my job responsibilities, thus being fortunate to build a thriving community. Being a talented and prolific streamer was seen as a valuable asset to any DevRel team at a time when we couldn't really travel safely, and I was proud of the viewership I achieved and sustained.\n\nMy next move was to the Netlify Developer Experience team in January 2022. One of the specific reasons they hired me was for the success of my Twitch streams. Netlify was, and still is, a fully remote company. However, as more and more companies started to force people to return to the office in 2023, viewership across the entirety of Twitch started to decline: no longer were people able to tune in to a Software and Game Dev Twitch stream in the background whilst they powered through their JIRA tickets. This, coupled with with the post-pandemic economic decline of the technology industry in general, caused the business value of DevRel teams to be questioned constantly. DevRel teams were now at the top of the elimination list, and this resulted in an alarming shift in how companies valued live streaming in DevRel.\n\nWe pay your salary to work for this company. We don't pay you to have fun on Twitch.\n\nI remember very vividly when words to that effect were said to me in a team meeting. It was crushing. The endeavour that had catapulted me into this career, the thing I loved to do so much, the brand of fun and entertainment I had poured my whole heart and soul into, the activity that had got me these first two jobs in the Developer Relations industry: was being condemned as valueless, trivial, worthless. Shortly after that conversation, I was made redundant in a company restructure.\n\nMy next move was to Sentry as a Senior Developer Relations Advocate. My manager was very supportive of my Twitch streaming activities and encouraged it, but I couldn't help shake the feeling that I was providing zero business value in return for my efforts. And it is a huge effort: being on camera for four hours at a time, writing code, problem-solving, building something real whilst maintaining an entertaining persona and conversing with viewers really takes it out of you. Plus, viewership across Twitch was declining further, given more and more people were returning to office, save for a few outliers. It also became quite obvious that I was in a sub-optimal time zone for sustained viewership. Twitch remains a very US-centric platform, especially in the Software and Game Dev category. There just weren't that many people browsing Twitch when I went live. Often, I would be at the top of the category when I was live, yet still with only around 100-130 concurrent viewers.\n\nNow, I have written about how your live coding stream does not need a bigger audience, and I stand by that. But, as someone who has a job where the value of your activities are constantly being questioned, that big audience is a real indicator of potential value. If you're showcasing great software to 500 people, the probability that you generate a good amount of interest which results in sign ups and eventual paying customers is much higher than if you're streaming to ~60 viewers. I'd been laid off once before in this industry. And so, naturally, I started to prioritise other activities at work that would be seen as being more valuable in order to keep my job, such as delivering more formal workshops and engaging in other more prominent marketing activities.\n\nAnd then in the autumn of 2024, my husband got really sick, and I didn't think he'd recover, and all of my priorities in life shifted. I stopped streaming entirely for around three months. And when I returned to Twitch, something didn't feel quite right. With all of the above considered around the conversation of business value, I didn't look forward to going live like I used to; whilst live streaming I felt like I was failing at my job — failing at delivering value. And then, the mental and physical exhaustion of the events that unfolded surrounding my husband's illness hit me hard. My body gave up. I could no longer use my hands without debilitating pain. I thought this would be a great opportunity for \"content\", however (like a fool). I live streamed learning to code with my voice, and it was, without exaggeration, a living hell. Talking simultaneously to a captive audience whilst learning how to talk to a machine whilst being in excruciating pain was so incredibly abhorrently vile I wouldn't recommend it to my worst enemy. (Not that I have enemies, mind you.) And so I took another break: mainly because I handed in my notice at Sentry to take some time to recover from all of this pain and exhaustion, to try and practise self-care, and to try and get my life together and my health back.\n\nA month later, I started a new role as Head of Developer Education at Nordcraft. Whilst I went live a few times at the start of my job to share this new and exciting developer tool with the world, something still didn't feel right. I couldn't stop hearing those words in my head: \"We pay your salary to work for this company. We don't pay you to have fun on Twitch.\" Now, obviously these words have not been uttered at Nordcraft and the people I work with are truly very wonderful, but I have more responsibility in this role than I have had in previous roles, and this company is a small start-up of just nine people, and therefore time in the workday is precious. Additionally, I am now a one-person department with many other responsibilities and priorities that just haven't afforded me the time to put everything aside and hang out on Twitch for four hours at a time to maintain that elusive viewership.\n\nI am so incredibly grateful for everything that streaming on Twitch has given me. I have built a network of talented friends in technology; I have become an international speaker; I built a whole ridiculous game played via my Twitch chat; I built some truly silly and fun projects; I pivoted my entire career; and I made friends for life. But, alas, it is time to move on to the next chapter.\n\nOn Thursday 18th December 2025, I will be going live on Twitch for the last time. I will also be ceremoniously turning off my Twitch bot (which will save me £84 a year) and will be making the code open source.\n\nThank you, everyone, for coming on this journey with me.\n\nLet's play p4nth3rworld one last time.\n\nI guess this time the game really does stop, when the stream ends.",

The numbers are ridiculous. It's around $10 trillion in the US and $70 trillion worldwide.\n\nAs owners/founders, investing a few tens of trillions to be able to \"just do it myself\" suddenly looks pretty smart.\n\nSo basically, this entire pitch to young people that there will always be jobs after you graduate—which I somehow lived my entire life thinking was a fucking Human Law of Physics—is actually just a temporary side effect of early civilizations with bad technology.\n\nWhat the actual hell.

    "description": "Workflow Patterns for AI-Assisted Development: Domain Language Mining. Discover jargon from an unfamiliar field using LLMs to help you write better software.",
    "fullText": "This is article is the first installment in the Workflow Patterns for AI-Assisted Development series. To get notified when a new article is published, \n\nDiscover jargon from an unfamiliar field using LLMs to help you write better software.\n\nYou are creating software to solve a problem. You are not the ideal customer for your software, or the problem it solves is new to you. You do not have easy access to experts in the problem domain.\n\nSoftware solves a problem better when it is made with a deep understanding of the problem. That level of awareness requires study, research, and practice. People who have this level of familiarity tend to have a useful mental model of the problem and its potential solutions. These experts also tend to use jargon, shorthand terms, and technical words: a domain language.\n\nMany software projects are written by developers who cannot talk to domain experts. These may be non-lean startups, side projects, portfolio pieces, or experiments. Developers also may do this when they solve a personal problem that is new to them.\n\nWorking without proper attention to this domain language “leads to unreliable software that doesn’t fit together” (Evans 2004, p. 24). The lack of vocabulary inhibits the knowledge acquisition, which is necessary for “ideas that lead to deep model insights” (ibid.)\n\nWhen a domain expert uses your software, it will not align with their expectations. They may struggle to use it. They may judge it as amateurish. They may decide your software is not for them.\n\nAdditionally, you may model less effectively if you’re using the wrong terms. This can lead to developing a wrong solution.\n\nUse LLMs to help you discover jargon the people who need your software use.\n\nChoose one piece of jargon, domain language, or technical knowledge you are trying to find. This might be a concept you don’t know the name of, a tool or process you believe might exist, or a best practice you believe should exist but can’t find.\n\nCraft a narrow prompt to try to extract that knowledge from the latent space encoded in the LLM.\n\nUse few-shot prompting to increase your odds of success. Choose three or more problem domains you are familiar with. Create a corollary pair of questions and answers for each. Ensure your answers are not too similar to each other. Include those question-answer pairs, and then ask your question.\n\nAdding examples to the prompt is known as few-shot prompting. Examples can be really useful when you explain things to people, and they’re even more useful when explaining things to LLMs. That’s because LLMs are great at picking up patterns in the prompt and continuing them in the completion. Therefore, you can use examples to show not only how exactly to interpret the question but also how exactly you want the LLM to give the answer.\n\nGive the same prompt to least three different models. Varied responses means more opportunities to find what you seek. Overlap between responses indicates relevance.\n\nVerify the candidate terms by searching dictionaries, especially domain-specific dictionaries. Search for the term in relevant academic writing, books, blogs, and forums. Continue verifying terms independently until you can qualify one as the likeliest to be correct.\n\nI am new to blogging, and I wanted a way to link multiple blog posts other than tags and categories. Specifically, I wanted to relate all of the posts that were in a series. I knew that a WordPress plugin would be useful for this, but I didn’t know what a blogger would usually call this series-oriented relationship.\n\nI crafted the following prompt using few-shot learning. I used examples from problem domains I am familiar with. I included examples ending in -ship, -ment, and -tion to reduce bias.\n\nI gave the same prompt to four different models. The responses gave me a broad series of options. It became clear that my lack of knowledge was hiding an important fact: the name of the relationship can change depending on why these blog posts are in a series.\n\nHere are semantic noun options for the relationship between Blog Post and Series:\n\nContext-dependent alternatives:\n\nMy personal favorite is Inclusion for its clarity and semantic precision, though Installment works beautifully if you want to emphasize the sequential, serialized nature of blog posts within a series.\n\nHere are good semantic-noun options for a relationship class between Blog Post and Series:\n\nBest general-purpose choice: Installment or Entry, depending on whether sequence matters.\n\nNice little modeling problem 😊\n\nHere are some semantic noun options for the relationship between Blog Post and Series:\n\nIf you want something that feels closest in style to Authorship/Membership/Enrollment, I’d probably shortlist:\n\nTo determine a suitable semantic noun for the relationship class between “Blog Post” and “Series”, we can consider the nature of their relationship. The given examples illustrate various relationships, such as authorship, membership, enrollment, assignment, participation, and contribution, which all describe how two entities are connected.\n\nFor “Blog Post” and “Series”, the relationship is about a blog post being part of a series. Here are some potential semantic nouns for this relationship:\n\nHowever, the most straightforward and semantically relevant noun for this relationship could be Serialization.\n\nOf these, “Serialization” directly conveys the idea of blog posts being part of a series, making it a strong candidate.\n\nHere are several semantic noun options for the relationship class between a Blog Post and a Series, categorized by the nature of the relationship:\n\nThis is the strongest semantic match for blog content. Just as a “Member” is the entity in a “Membership,” a post in a series is often called an “Installment.” It implies a periodic release schedule typical of blogging.\n\nIf the defining characteristic of the relationship is the specific numerical order (e.g., Part 1, Part 2, Part 3), “Sequence” or “Ordering” describes the link effectively.\n\nIf the blog series tells a story or follows a journey (e.g., “Our Startup Journey,” “Travel Diaries”), this noun borrows the semantic weight of TV or podcasts to imply a narrative arc.\n\nIf the series is educational, long-form, or intended to be read like a book, “Chapter” elevates the relationship to suggest a distinct, substantive section of a larger whole.\n\nIf the series is a loose collection of related posts without a strict chronological necessity (e.g., “Best of 2023,” “Editor’s Picks”), this implies the act of gathering or curating.\n\nBecause of the specific kinds of series I wanted to create, and because of its frequency across different responses, I chose installment as my candidate. I searched blog series \"installment\" and article series \"installment\" on Kagi, Marginalia, Google Scholar, and the O’Reilly Learning Platform. The resources I found verified that bloggers and journalists use this term for the same purpose. I looked through Technical Blogging, 2nd Edition by Antonio Cangiano and found its use in Chapter 4. I was satisfied with this term, so I did not verify other candidates.\n\nInstead of using a substitute word, inventing a new term, or using a concept from the language of a different problem domain, you will know the jargon used by the people who need your software. This will help you build a better model of the problem, and your solution will be more likely to be useful, accepted, and appreciated.\n\nThis was the first installment in the Workflow Patterns for AI-Assisted Development series. To get notified when a new article is published, \n\nThe image in this article was generated using AI tools (Nano Banana Pro) based on creative prompts. The written word in this article is proudly human-made, except for the five designated LLM outputs in the Example.",

    "description": "Chemical industry lobbyists have long pushed the government to adopt a less stringent approach to gauging the cancer risk from chemicals, one that would help ease regulations on companies that make or use them.",
    "fullText": "The chemical industry finally got its wish.\n\nIndustry lobbyists have long pushed the federal government to adopt a less stringent approach to gauging the cancer risk from chemicals, one that would help ease regulations on companies that make or use them.\n\nLast week, in a highly unusual move, the Environmental Protection Agency embraced that approach in announcing that it is revising an assessment of the health dangers posed by formaldehyde, a widespread pollutant that causes far more cancer than any other chemical in the air. Working on that effort were two of those former industry insiders, who are now top EPA officials.\n\nThe proposed revisions to the assessment, released Wednesday, nearly double the amount of formaldehyde considered safe to inhale compared with the version that was finalized in the last weeks of the Biden administration. Even that older assessment significantly underestimated the dangers posed by formaldehyde, a ProPublica investigation published last year found.\n\nUnder previous Republican and Democratic administrations, EPA scientists were instructed to assume that chemicals that cause cancer by damaging DNA — the largest group of carcinogens, which includes formaldehyde — pose a “linear” risk, meaning that even small exposures can be dangerous. The agency adopted the approach almost 40 years ago to protect against the multitude of low-level cancer threats the public faces daily. But the industry’s favored method assumes that certain carcinogens pose no risk at lower levels and that the danger should only be considered once exposure reaches a certain threshold.\n\nThe Trump administration has already criticized the use of the linear model for calculating the risk of cancer from radiation and could scrap its use in examining other chemicals.\n\nThe EPA’s adoption of this threshold model for formaldehyde might come as little surprise given that some of the scientists who have promoted the approach on behalf of companies are now running the agency.\n\nAmong them are Nancy Beck and Lynn Dekleva, who both previously worked for the chemical industry’s main trade group, the American Chemistry Council, which represents more than 190 companies and has vigorously pushed back against the EPA’s efforts to regulate formaldehyde. As recently as 2022, Dekleva, then senior director of the trade group’s chemical products and technology division, wrote to an EPA scientist to advocate using the threshold approach in assessing the chemical. The EPA subsequently explored — and dismissed — the suggestion; the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine independently examined the decision and supported it.\n\nToday Dekleva serves as the deputy assistant administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, which conducted the formaldehyde assessment. Beck, a principal deputy assistant administrator who runs the office, signed off on the official agency memo that described the changes.\n\nAccording to federal conflict of interest rules, EPA employees are prohibited for a year from working on specific issues in which their former employer is a party or represents one, unless they first obtain written permission from the agency’s ethics office. Beck and Dekleva did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAsked about Dekleva and Beck’s involvement in the recent decision to change the agency’s approach to the risks of formaldehyde, an EPA spokesperson wrote in an email to ProPublica that Beck and Dekleva had obtained ethics advice from the agency that approved their work on the issue. “Because formaldehyde is produced by many manufacturers and is used across many industrial sectors, this risk evaluation is not a specific party matter that raises concerns for them under the federal ethics rules,” the spokesperson wrote.\n\nThe spokesperson described the changes to the formaldehyde assessment as corrections of past scientific mistakes. “Through a rigorous peer review process, we determined the Biden Administration used flawed analyses in its risk assessment of formaldehyde,” the spokesperson wrote. “We are correcting the record to reflect the best available science and our core statutory obligations.”\n\nThe assessment released under Biden found 58 situations in which workers or consumers face an unreasonable risk to health from formaldehyde — a designation that requires the agency to mitigate it. Among the items that can emit dangerous levels of the chemical are automotive-care products like car waxes, along with crafting supplies, ink and toner, photographic supplies and fabrics, building materials, textiles and leather goods. The EPA is reversing the finding that formaldehyde presents an unreasonable risk to health in five situations while leaving dozens more standing. One of those five involves the manufacturing of wood products.\n\nThe agency contends that the level of formaldehyde the EPA now says is acceptable under the revised assessment will protect people from cancer and the other harmful effects, which include asthma, miscarriage and fertility problems.\n\nBut environmental advocates see the Trump administration’s reversal on cancer risk as a reflection of industry’s influence over the agency.\n\n“The science on formaldehyde hasn’t changed; these are the same arguments that the chemical industry’s been peddling for the last decade,” said Jonathan Kalmuss-Katz, an attorney at Earthjustice, the country’s biggest public interest environmental law firm. “The only difference is that they’ve finally found an administration willing to ignore the findings of its own scientists.”\n\nFor decades, formaldehyde has been at the center of bitter battles between industry and regulators. Sometimes described as the backbone of American commerce, the chemical is used in everything from binding particleboards in furniture to serving as a building block in plastic and preserving bodies — and has fierce defenders in many sectors.\n\nOur investigation identified significant levels of formaldehyde inside cars, stores and our own homes. ProPublica’s analysis of EPA data also determined that, in every census block throughout the country, the risk of getting cancer from exposure to formaldehyde in outdoor air over a lifetime is higher than the limit of one incidence of cancer in a million people, the agency’s goal for air pollutants. According to our analysis, some 320 million people — nearly all Americans — live in areas of the U.S. where the lifetime cancer risk from outdoor exposure to formaldehyde is 10 times higher than the agency’s ideal.\n\nAs of last year, official EPA estimates put the average risk from formaldehyde in the air at 20 times higher than the limit. But, as our investigation found, that number does not reflect the risk of myeloid leukemia, a potentially fatal blood cancer. (EPA scientists calculated that risk but, because of internal disputes about its certainty, left it out of their final number.) When myeloid leukemia is included, the cancer risk from formaldehyde jumps to 77 times higher than the limit.\n\nFormer EPA veterans fear that the threshold approach to evaluating cancer risk could be applied to ease health-based protections on other carcinogens. “This will open the floodgates,” said Tracey Woodruff, a scientist at the University of California San Francisco School of Medicine who worked at the EPA for 13 years. “Chemical companies want every carcinogen to be considered a threshold carcinogen, which would allow them to say that their chemicals are safe when we know that is not true.”\n\nThe agency is in the process of producing risk evaluations for several other potentially cancer-causing chemicals, including 1,2-dichloroethane and 1,3-butadiene, which are used in plastics manufacturing. These decisions are especially consequential because, after the EPA finalizes a rule based on the assessment, states are prohibited from issuing their own protections on the same chemical.\n\nThe EPA can finalize its proposed changes to its formaldehyde assessment after the public comment period ends on Feb. 2. Then it must issue a rule that addresses any unreasonable risk posed by the chemical.\n\nThe Trump administration is also taking aim at the use of the linear approach to cancer risk from radiation. An executive order issued in May deemed the method of assessing a chemical’s cancer risk to be flawed and directed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to consider adopting new radiation exposure limits. Project 2025, the blueprint for the Trump presidency, similarly urges the EPA office that handles radiation to reassess the linear approach it has taken to cancer risk from radiation in the past. The EPA press office did not respond to a question about whether this work is underway.\n\nThe new revision to the formaldehyde assessment also marks a stark break with the Integrated Risk Information System, or IRIS, an EPA program that quantified the health risks from formaldehyde last year. Previously, reports like the formaldehyde assessment, which was conducted under the federal chemicals law known as the Toxic Substances Control Act, have relied on values calculated by IRIS. But, in what appears to be an agency first, the EPA rejected the levels that the program calculated for the chemical last year.\n\nThe sidelining of IRIS was another item on the chemical industry’s wishlist and, with the EPA’s latest changes on formaldehyde, also appears to be near complete. Project 2025 called for the elimination of the program. Of 55 scientists who worked on its recent assessments, only eight remain in their jobs after a reorganization of the agency, ProPublica found in October. The EPA has still not published the most recent IRIS report, an assessment of the toxicity of the forever chemical PFNA, which was finalized in April.\n\nThe EPA did not respond to questions about when it plans to publish the PFNA assessment or the status of the program.",

    "description": "Paramount Skydance and Netflix bid for Warner Bros. Discovery, highlighting streaming, Hollywood jobs, and regulatory approval in their rival pitches.",
    "fullText": "Hollywood's latest high-drama battle of the titans: Paramount versus Netflix.\n\nDavid Ellison's Paramount made a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Discovery after WBD rebuffed its multiple offers and accepted Netflix's offer to buy its studio and streaming business.\n\nThis means Ellison, who is backed by his billionaire father, Larry Ellison of Oracle, is making his case directly to shareholders on why he'd be the best owner for WBD.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"\n\nNetflix didn't respond to the hostile bid but has said that by combining its streaming hits with WBD's classic library and prestige HBO fare, it can supercharge its offering.\n\n\"Together, we can give audiences around the world even more value and choice, and get one step closer to being the most loved and the most valued entertainment company,\" Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in announcing the deal Friday.\n\nHere's how the companies made their cases to various stakeholders, which include investors, employees, Hollywood talent, and regulators.\n\nFinancials: Paramount offered $30 per WBD share for all of WBD, compared to Netflix's offer of $27.75 per WBD share for its streaming and studios business, excluding its TV networks, such as CNN and TNT. While Netflix's offer was a mix of cash and stock, Ellison emphasized that Paramount's offer is all cash, and $17.6 billion more than the Netflix deal, an $82.7 billion offer that includes $72 billion in equity.\n\nApproval: Ellison repeatedly argued that he's more likely to win regulatory approval than Netflix is. He said he anticipated approval coming in as little as 12 months. President Donald Trump said he'll be \"involved\" in evaluating the deal. Larry Ellison is a longtime ally of Trump, and the firm of Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, is part of the Paramount offer.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Ellison argued that the Paramount deal would be good for jobs and consumers. He said Paramount is committed to growing the film and TV output of both businesses, including a theatrical slate of 30-plus releases a year. It's a pointed contrast with Netflix, whose preference for getting movies onto its streaming service quickly has created friction with the film industry. (Netflix has said it would continue to release Warner Bros. movies in theaters.) Ellison said adding WBD would make Paramount a robust competitor to Netflix, while Netflix buying WBD would extend its dominance in streaming and give it more power to raise prices to consumers.\n\nFinancials: Netflix said the deal would give it a number of financial benefits. While Netflix is the top subscription streaming service, it has a ways to go in creating culture-defining IP. A big part of Netflix's pitch is that it'll be able to build on WBD's famous franchises like DC Comics and Harry Potter, fueling a flywheel that'll expand its business. WBD would have to pay a $2.8 billion breakup fee if it accepts a different offer, which Netflix said limited its risk. On the other hand, Netflix would have to pay a $5.8 billion breakup fee if the deal were blocked by regulators.\n\nApproval: Wall Street analysts have generally characterized Netflix as having a tougher approval path. However, the company has been making the pitch to Trump and his administration. Trump said Sunday that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos visited him last week. Trump said Sarandos was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" However, Trump added that Netflix has \"a very big market share,\" which \"could be a problem.\" Netflix expressed confidence in the approval process, saying it expects the deal to close in 12 to 18 months, after WBD completes its spinoff of linear channels into a new company, Discovery Global.\n\nHollywood and consumers: Netflix said the deal would provide better choice and value for consumers by bringing together the Warner Bros. film and TV show libraries with its own offerings, and help the WBD's creators reach a bigger audience. Netflix said many of its subscribers don't \n\nWith Hollywood employment stagnating, Netflix also argued that the addition of Warner Bros. would let it expand its production and increase jobs over the long term. It expects to achieve $2 billion to $3 billion in cost savings from the deal, primarily coming from eliminating overlapping support staff. Sarandos contrasted this with a Paramount outcome.\n\n\"In the offer Paramount is talking about today, they're talking about $6 billion of synergies,\" he said at a UBS conference on Monday. \"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs. We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"",

While you can still use weapons from the last few years, the most powerful options are going to be the new Black Ops 7 guns. In this guide, we'll provide some recommended weapon builds for Warzone in Season 1 of Black Ops 7.\n\nSeason 1 removes the Wildcard perks from Black Ops 6, and instead, you'll have Overkill by default. This means you can equip a second primary weapon without the need to select any specific perks to your loadouts. This also means there's no Gunfighter Wildcard, so you are limited to five attachments for each weapon build.\n\nThe Gunsmith is mostly the same this year; however, one new addition is Black Ops 7's weapon build code feature. Weapon build codes are unique to each weapon and a specific set of attachments, making it easy to share and receive custom weapon builds.\n\nSimply hit L3 to view your options while you are in the Gunsmith. This will let you import a weapon build code to use. Additionally, any weapon builds you create in the Gunsmith will have a code generated at the bottom-left corner of your screen.\n\nWe'll list the attachments for each build and include the unique weapon code so you can easily use it.\n\nSeason 1 of Black Ops 7 overhauls Warzone's perk selection. Make sure to check out our guide for all Warzone perks for BO7, including some recommended perks to try for your loadouts.\n\nAll our recommended Warzone loadouts can be viewed below, and we also have suggested multiplayer loadouts.\n\nThe MXR-17 is a powerful and easy-to-use assault rifle for long-range fights in Warzone. The recommended attachments will boost the gun's damage range, bullet velocity, and increase ammo count.\n\nThe Greaves AccuSpot 3X is a great optic for most long-range builds, but if you're playing small map Resurgence and don't want the bigger scope, you can swap this out for something simple and clean like the Lethal Tools ELO.\n\nThe MK.78 light machine gun is a heavy-hitting, long-range option for Warzone. The recommended attachments will help you reduce the gun's recoil, making this much more manageable to use at range.\n\nThe recommended magazine is a Prestige attachment, so you might not have this unlocked yet, but it's a very impactful attachment for improving mobility and reducing recoil. You can substitute the Gravepack Extended Belt if needed to simply boost the ammo count until you unlock it.\n\nThe X9 Maverick is a three-round burst assault rifle with high damage, and it can be a powerful choice for long-range fights. The recommended attachments will greatly boost the gun's damage range and bullet velocity, as well as improve the aim-down-sight speed.\n\nBuild code: A04-2JEC3-WMFDM-VJ11\n\nThe DS20 Mirage assault rifle is another solid pick for assault rifles in Black Ops 7, but this gun also has a great build for a sniper support class. The recommended attachments will boost the ammo count, reduce recoil, and improve movement speed to make this gun work great for close to medium-range fights.\n\nThe MPC-25 submachine gun doesn't feel very powerful in multiplayer, but it's a powerful gun with a fast time-to-kill in battle royale. The recommended attachments will help reduce a lot of the weapon's recoil, and it will also boost the ammo count.\n\nThis recommended build includes an optic for cleaner sights, but if you don't mind the iron sights, it's worth swapping the optic for the 14.5\" VAS Ashe Barrel for an increase to the damage range.\n\nSeason 1's new Kogot-7 submachine gun is another solid choice for close-range combat in battle royale. The Kogot-7 does have a bit of recoil, but the recommended attachments will work to reduce quite a bit of the gun's kick.\n\nThe VS Recon is a deadly bolt-action sniper rifle, and this is a popular choice for sniping in Season 1. The recommended attachments will increase the damage range and bullet velocity, and also reduce some of the weapon's kick.\n\nThe recommended underbarrel attachment is a Prestige attachment, so you might not have unlocked this yet, and you can substitute it for the Stetig-C Handguard if needed.\n\nBuild code: R01-21WSG-L369K-P711",

While some industry trends have been met with negativity, others have become staples that gamers everywhere have come to enjoy. Cross-play or cross-platform support, allowing players to connect with their friends and other players on different systems from their own, has been a very welcome development. 10 years ago, this feature wasn't present in most titles--now, there are hundreds of games that let you play alongside or against other players regardless of their platform of choice.\n\nCross-platform games are still few and far between in the grand scheme of things, so it might be difficult to discern which have the feature andare worth playing. If you have friends with a different system but want to play together, we've assembled a look at the 33 best cross-platform games you can play right now. This list is in no particular order. Be sure to also check out our lists of the best PS5 games, best Switch games, best Xbox games, and best PC games.\n\nFortnite is the game that popularized the cross-platform feature when it was released back in 2017. More specifically, the battle royale mode that took over the gaming community in the late 2010s featured cross-platform play at a time when platform holders were resistant to the idea. Regardless of if you had a friend on PS4 and you were on PC, you could squad up with them by simply adding their Epic Games ID. Developer Epic Games is responsible for many industry standards we see today, but perhaps its most influential work came with adding the cross-platform feature into Fortnite--something that was initially \"accidentally\" added to the game before being pulled.\n\nCall of Duty has featured cross-platform play for several years at this point, and that didn’t change with the release of Black Ops 7. In addition to Warzone, which continually gets integrated with the mainline series games every year, Black Ops 7 features an extremely seamless cross-platform experience. However, players can choose to only matchmake with other players on the same platform as them, allowing PlayStation and Xbox users to avoid the potential cheating issues on PC. Whichever way you decide to play Call of Duty with your friends, there will always be a title to hop into and plenty to do once you're playing.\n\nSea of Thieves is a late bloomer when it comes to both the gameplay experience and cross-platform functionality. While cross-play has been available between Xbox and PC for years, the game recently came to PS5 and introduced an entirely new crop of players. PS5 users can take full advantage of cross-play and join up with friends on both Xbox and PC. More players getting to hop in and experience Sea of Thieves only bodes well for a game that has become one of the best co-op games on the market.\n\nEA's battle royale darling, Apex Legends, is one of the best free games on Steam and also lets you play with those on any platform. The free-to-play game came out of nowhere in 2019 and offered cross-platform features right out of the gate. Since its release, the Apex community has only gotten stronger and the game has an almost overwhelming amount of content to consume. There are ranked playlists, different battle royale modes, loads of customization, and new non-BR modes being added all the time. You can experience all of that with friends on any available platform.\n\nOne of the more recent additions on this list, Helldivers 2 has been an extremely pleasant surprise in 2024. Featuring extremely fun and inventive gameplay, few current games can match the same level of enjoyment Helldivers 2 offers. While the game's not currently available on Xbox, there's full cross-platform functionality between PS5 and PC. You and up to two friends can spread democracy across the universe, blowing away robots and bugs alike. Working together as a team of three is extremely rewarding, especially when your Stratagems are all working in concert. Friendly fire makes the action all the more chaotic and hilarious.\n\nDestiny 2 has become a live-service behemoth, releasing back in 2017 but still pulling in large numbers of players in 2024. While the cross-platform feature wasn't available at launch in Destiny 2, it has since become one of the game's main selling points. You can play with any friend, anywhere, as the game promotes. There's a little something for everyone in Destiny 2, as you can take part in both PvE and PvP modes, with PvE being the game's strong suit, where activities like raids and dungeons require intense cooperation amongst players. Best of all, though, the base game in Destiny 2 is completely free. You can check out our previous list of the best free games in 2024 as well.\n\nOften referred to as \"car soccer,\" Rocket League is one of the longest-running games on this list. Cross-play was added post-launch, and the way it works has slightly changed over the years, especially after Epic Games acquired developer Psyonix, but the functionality is still as seamless as ever. Rocket League features one of the highest skill ceilings of any multiplayer game on the market, but it's incredibly enjoyable to learn and play. You can experience car soccer for yourself at no charge.\n\nDead by Daylight is an online survival game with some horror elements, but nothing too major that you have to play it with the lights on. The premise of the game is simple, as there's one killer in a lobby with four other players. The killer attempts to, you guessed it, eliminate the four players while the players band together to survive. You can use a myriad of tools and equipment to stop the killer, but the killer has access to some lethal weapons as well. There's cross-play available across all of Dead by Daylight's platforms, and the game is a true treat with a full lobby of friends.\n\nIf you're a fan of cross-platform games, you knew this entry was coming. Minecraft is one of the most successful video games of all time, reaching as far as any game can in the modern world. There are dozens of different ways to play Minecraft, and all of them offer cross-platform functionality. Unfortunately, if you're on PS3 or Xbox 360, you won't get to partake in any cross-play features. The rest of the platforms can join up with anyone else, provided you're all on the same edition of Minecraft. The timeless crafting/survival gameplay lets you adventure with friends, building bases, and exploring limitless worlds.\n\nOverwatch 2 carried over plenty of features from the original game, and cross-play was one of them. Cross-play in Overwatch 2 works exactly as it did in the first game, allowing you to play in a lobby with any other player. This is a great feature for Overwatch 2, as playing as a team is critical due to the interplay between support characters, tanks, and damage dealers. You and your friends can tackle both unranked and ranked playlists as well as other modes that are available with the various in-game seasons. Having everyone pick their hero and work through a map in unison is a terrific feeling.\n\nNBA 2K is another long-running franchise that has featured cross-platform play. Similar to how other online games operate, though, NBA 2K26 only allows cross-platform functionality for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S users. If you're on a last-generation console, PC, or Nintendo Switch 2, you won't have any sort of access to cross-platform features. The game features a revamped hub area, The City, where players can engage with their friends as well as random players in a massive online environment.\n\nBefore No Man's Sky launched, the developers at Hello Games promised that you could run into other players when exploring the vast universe. That initially turned out to be untrue but was eventually corrected following a series of updates as No Man's Sky slowly won back the trust of its community. Now, you can run into other players as well as play with any player, regardless of their platform. Cross-play is terrific in No Man's Sky, as you and some friends can roam the galaxy together, build bases on new planets, take part in intergalactic warfare with other players, and complete quests at various space stations.\n\nAt the height of the pandemic in 2020, certain games became instant phenomenons within the community as everyone was gaming at home. Fall Guys came out at the perfect time, and it just so happened to be one of the more enjoyable and inventive titles of the past few years at the time of its release. A new take on the battle royale genre, you control a bean as you maneuver different obstacle courses and try to be the last player standing in a lobby of 60. You can party up with any player on any platform and compete against them to prove you're the superior gamer.\n\nSpeaking of games that became popular during the pandemic, few games have brought the gaming community together like Among Us did in 2020. Among Us blended strategy and horror with the murder mystery genre to create an experience like few others. You and other players all load into a map, where your main job is to complete various tasks. However, one player has been designated as the impostor, whose job is to blend in and slowly eliminate other players without being caught. Among Us creates some truly hilarious moments, and you can experience it with anyone on any platform, even on mobile.\n\nIt was inevitable that one of the best MMORPGs would make this list, and it's only right that Final Fantasy XIV take the spot. One of the most-respected games in its genre, FFXIV is bursting with content and is still receiving regular expansions and updates. While it does cost money to experience the entire game, you can play the full story plus two expansions at no cost. Moreover, you can meet up with players across all of the available platforms. Whether you're completing quests, exploring new lands, training one of the many jobs, or taking part in combat, there's something for everyone in FFXIV.\n\nDiablo IV has kept a core audience in place with seasonal updates that keep adding content to Sanctuary. The ARPG features a fantastic base game with an enthralling story, interesting characters, and plenty of loot. The class system is also engaging, allowing you to fully shape your character's playstyle and your abilities. Diablo IV features full co-op with up to four players and those players can be from any available platform.\n\nOne of the titles that popularized the \"gacha\" system in games, Genshin Impact is a massive game that's still going strong in 2024. An open-world action-RPG, the title allows you to play as numerous characters and use a wide variety of weapons as you navigate an expansive map. Part of what makes Genshin Impact so popular is the party system, where you can join up on a friend's world and clear Domains or complete quests together. It doesn't matter what system a player is on; if they're playing, you can join their world, provided you're playing on the same Adventure Rank.\n\nThe term cross-play is technically spelled \"Krossplay\" in Mortal Kombat 1, but the feature still does everything you would expect it to do. Support for it was added in early 2024, allowing friends to fight each other in online playlists or private matches. However, cross-platform features aren't available for Nintendo Switch players. Mortal Kombat 1 doesn't reinvent the wheel when it comes to the fighting genre, but it's a highly enjoyable game with a high skill ceiling that's not for the faint of heart.\n\nRacing games aren't as plentiful in the market as they used to be, but it's difficult to beat the experience you can have in Forza Horizon 5. A true graphical marvel, Forza Horizon 5 is an incredible racing game that features a large open world set in a fictional version of Mexico and plenty to do across all the locations. You can unlock a myriad of vehicles, including iconic cars, and race against NPCs or real players. There are also dozens of other game modes to take part in, which you can do so against friends who are on Xbox or PC. It's one of the best games on Game Pass, meaning if you have a subscription, you'll be able to play it without buying it.\n\nThere's really no succinct way to describe what Roblox has evolved into. The game is essentially composed of thousands of other games, all available to download with a few clicks. The genres in Roblox are bountiful, with first-person shooters, RPGs, action-adventure games, strategy games, and more. If you want to take part in any specific game with a friend, all you need to ensure is they have the game properly downloaded. Mobile players can join up with console players and even VR users can create a part for anyone to join.\n\nA newer entry into the FPS genre, The Finals is a high-octane shooter that rewards ingenuity, aggressive gameplay, and accurate shots. You play across arenas that are all completely destructible, making each match feel different from the last depending on what you or others decide to destroy. The core feeling of The Finals is an arcade shooter where the goal is to eliminate enemy players, but it features more replayability than many FPS titles on the market today. You can experience the game in full cross-play with any other player regardless of platform.\n\nBorderlands 4 is the newest entry in the famed looter shooter franchise, and unlike its predecessor, Borderlands 3, the cross-platform features actually function correctly. All platforms feature cross-platform functionality, and the Shift system makes it fairly simple to use. Players just need to make a Shift account and then link it to their system. After that, other players can add you using that account, and then you can join their party to play through Borderlands 4 together. Ideally, most players in your party are roughly the same level, but you can still play with people who are at different parts in the story than you. Keep an eye on our list of Borderlands 4 Shift codes for an extra helping hand in snagging some sweet loot.\n\nChivarly 2 is a first-person action game that takes place in medieval times. You can take part in massive bow-and-arrow and sword-and-shield wars on a battlefield or mount a steed and take a more fast-paced approach to combat. The game takes you through historical battles, letting you live out what it was like for soldiers back in the medieval era. Chivarly 2 is incredibly realistic, allowing you to fight through an excessive amount of damage, and can be played with a friend on any available platform.\n\nWhile Smite might not be the most popular MOBA on the market, it's an enjoyable experience that you can play for free with friends and other players across any available system. Like most MOBAs, Smite features a steep learning curve, as you have to understand each character's abilities and how they work on the map. However, with time, you'll start to master the \"deities\" you enjoy playing as and can take that knowledge into several different game modes. It's also worth noting that Smite 2, the upcoming sequel to Smite, is also going to be cross-platform with the current-gen consoles and PC.\n\nDeep Rock Galactic takes players on a solo or co-op adventure to some of the deadliest mining locations across the galaxy. Players are tasked with clearing out mining sites that are infested with enemies, collecting resources and leveling up their character along the way. Deep Rock Galactic isn't technically classified as a looter shooter, so don't expect weapons and items to fall from the enemies you eliminate. However, there are horror elements and tons of randomized levels to clear out. Deep Rock Galactic supports cross-platform, albeit with some limitations: PS4 and PS5 players can join up together, but PC players need to be on the Xbox Store version of the game to link up with those on Xbox consoles. Users on Steam are limited to playing with other Steam players.\n\nSplit Fiction is the newest co-op adventure from developer Hazelight Studios, the same team behind former Game of the Year Winner It Takes Two. While Split Fiction isn't a sequel to It Takes Two by any means, it takes many of the concepts from the game and cranks them up a notch. You still have to have a partner to play the game, but the Friend's Pass makes it easy to invite any friend you want, regardless of their platform. It allows them to play with you without even buying the game.\n\nIn-game, you and your partner take control of two characters and they try to escape a virtual reality experiment gone wrong. You'll travel to cyberpunk-inspired cities and fantasy lands while engaging with a number of different genres along the way. There's platforming, third-person shooting, vehicle racing, and more awaiting you. It's a terrific experience, earning a rare 10 in GameSpot's Split Fiction review.\n\nThe Monster Hunter series is back with Monster Hunter Wilds. The new installment keeps the same formula in place from previous games in the series, but adds in several fan-requested mechanics, a dynamic world, and updates to combat that can change up your style from fight to fight. Some of the new features include a larger and more interactive map, the ability to ride around on a mount, and a secondary weapon that you can swap to at any time.\n\nThere's no shortage of content in Monster Hunter Wilds, as you can go through a 15-hour campaign and eventually reach the endgame, where dozens of more monsters and quests are awaiting your challenge. One of the best parts of your journey through this content is that you can play with up to three friends during any part of the game. That said, playing with those on other platforms can be unintuitive, so be sure to check out our Monster Hunter Wilds cross-platform explainer for assistance.\n\nMarvel Rivals took the gaming industry by storm at the tail end of 2024, and it's still going strong in 2025. The free-to-play hero shooter utilizes a lineup of nearly 40 Marvel characters that you can use throughout a variety of modes. Each one of these heroes possesses different abilities and has a designated role: Vanguard, Duelist, or Strategist. Every match in Marvel Rivals can only have one of every hero per team, so it's worthwhile to master several characters in case your main gets taken.\n\nAside from the heroes, Marvel Rivals features several maps, casual and ranked modes, and a plethora of events and cosmetics. An important distinction to make with Marvel Rivals is that you can only use cross-platform play in casual modes; ranked modes require you to play with players solely on your platform.\n\nTekken 8 is the first game in the storied franchise to implement any form of cross-platform play. The eighth installment of the long-running series is what fans have come to expect from the fighting game genre. You have access to a huge lineup of fighters that you can use to go through the story mode with or engage in multiplayer fights with online players. There are some quirky game modes as well, such as Tekken Ball, where you're fighting a real opponent but using a beach ball instead of your fists/feet.\n\nAlso, even a year after its release, Tekken 8 is still delivering impactful updates that change the game on the fly. The recent Season 2 update completely changed several different characters to make them stronger, added a new character, and adjusted combat across the board.\n\nThe tactical, first-person shooter genre has started to evolve over the past several years, as games like Valorant have added new spins to change up the formula. FragPunk is the latest game to add a twist on the genre, delivering high-octane gameplay that incorporates both existing and fresh mechanics. Every FragPunk match consists of a team of individual Lancers, who all have unique abilities that need to be purchased through the game's economy system. You can also purchase weapons and equipment with the money you earn throughout the match.\n\nHowever, the major curveball that FragPunk throws is the introduction of Shard Cards. These can be used at the start of a match and implement new twists that every player has to adapt to. Depending on what cards and Lancers are used, matches can play out completely differently. FragPunk delivers cross-platform play across all modes, so you can easily figure out a strategy with your team before each begins.\n\nPath of Exile 2 is an ARPG that plays extremely similarly to something like Diablo IV. You can pick from a variety of different classes that offer completely unique playstyles, abilities, and gear preferences. You'll then enter the world that's cut up into levels and different areas within those levels. Each level contains several bosses, side quests, and a main hub town. The main draw of Path of Exile 2 is its extraordinary class design, which allows you to craft thousands of in-depth character builds using passive and active abilities as well as specific gear. You'll often need to design new builds as you progress the story in PoE 2, as the difficulty curve in-game is something ARPG fans might not be used to. Enemies and bosses can be very tough to defeat, and there's no way to lower your difficulty other than playing in a group with friends so you can maximize your damage output.\n\nAfter a couple of years of waiting, cross-platform play was finally added to Baldur's Gate 3 in one of the game's final updates. You can now play with up to three other players in your party, and all of them can be on different platforms. Baldur's Gate 3 is one of the best RPGs and video games to be released in recent memory. It's a stunning role-playing experience that allows you to fully create a character from scratch or use an existing pre-made character with their own backstory, abilities, and attributes. Once your character is made, you'll embark on an incredible journey that sees you travel through several massive levels, all of which have dozens of characters to meet and interact with, in-depth quests to take on, and secrets to uncover. The combat in Baldur's Gate 3 is turn-based, so if you're not used to that style, you'll have to take some time to understand it. Once you do, though, every combat situation is enthralling as you try to figure out the best strategy to take out enemies with your party and all of their unique characters.\n\nSplit Fiction is a co-op game that requires two players to play; there's no solo option or any form of online matchmaking. This means you have to find a friend who's willing to play with you. Fortunately, Split Fiction is fully cross-platform and only makes one person buy the game, as the Friend Pass allows your buddy to join for free. The other player just has to accept an invite code. From there, you and your partner will start your split-screen adventure in Split Fiction. The game follows two author protagonists as they get entangled in a virtual mess that results in them being stuck in the plot of each other's book ideas. Using co-op mechanics and communication, you and your partner will experience jaw-dropping visuals, hilarious moments, and several side stories that will keep you thoroughly entertained as you work your way through the game. Split Fiction also features some varied combat, vehicles, and plenty of other wacky mechanics that always keep you guessing throughout every level.",

    "title": "It used to be for shopping and lipstick. Now, a Chinese app is a haven for tech workers to swap AI intel.",
    "description": "Chinese app Rednote started off as a shopping app. Now, it's one of the hottest hubs for Chinese tech workers in Silicon Valley to talk shop about AI.",
    "fullText": "When the Chinese app Rednote launched in 2013, it was mainly used for shopping and cosmetics reviews. Now, it's one of the hottest hubs for Chinese tech workers in Silicon Valley to talk shop about AI.\n\nRednote is also known as Xiaohongshu, which translates to \"Little Red Book.\" For Chinese tech workers in the Bay Area working at companies like OpenAI and Meta, Rednote has become a sort of home away from home for shopping and food recommendations. And since the launch of ChatGPT, AI-related content on Rednote has exploded.\n\nTechnology-related content on the app has more than doubled in the past year, and the number of tech-related creators has more than tripled, according to Rednote. Many users post video reviews or tutorials of AI models, just like people review their favorite beauty products.\n\n\"Every time a new model is out, people on Xiaohongshu will share their reviews,\" said Tony Peng, founder of the Recode China AI newsletter. \"If I want real user-generated feedback, I go to Xiaohongshu.\"\n\nMany American Gen Z users downloaded Rednote in January amid fears of a TikTok ban. More than half of the app's users were born after 1995, Rednote said.\n\nTech founders told Business Insider that they have used Rednote to promote their startups, demo products, and hire people. Some of the most popular posts on Rednote focus on Big Tech companies or AI giants such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google DeepMind. Users may share their anxieties about the tech job market, ask for help, or discuss the compensation packages they've received.\n\nBrandon Chen, cofounder and CEO of the AI-powered chat app Intent, needed to apply for a visa last year to work in the US.\n\nTo do this, he had to prepare hundreds of PDFs for his lawyer, and he decided to write an AI program to help organize them. He posted before-and-after screenshots of his project on Rednote. Soon, people messaged him asking if he would release it as an app so they could use it.\n\n\"I thought it was amazing. I just randomly developed something for myself,\" Chen told Business Insider.\n\nHe ended up releasing it as a product called Riffo.\n\nChen said he used Rednote to promote his product and even to recruit workers in Japan. He posted on Rednote asking if any Japanese speakers could help with his social media expansion efforts, and within 15 minutes, someone reached out, Chen said.\n\nQian Chen, a journalist and media entrepreneur who cofounded the tech media company Valley101, said she distributes her videos on channels including YouTube, WeChat, and Rednote. The videos she has produced on topics like Meta's recent AI layoffs, and the battle between ChatGPT and Google, have performed especially well on Rednote, she said.\n\nRednote helps startup founders foster communities, users say.\n\nBill Zhu, founder and CEO of Pokee AI, which uses AI to build workflows, said he found a tight-knit community on Rednote to share his learnings, attract users for his products, connect with others, and ask for feedback. Rednote users are often drawn to posts about personal experiences, Zhu said. In Rednote posts, he has chronicled his fundraising efforts, including successes and setbacks.\n\n\"You can actually connect with the founder,\" Zhu said. \"It's someone you're actually talking to. You can reach out to this person building this awesome piece of tech that is able to solve these problems.\"\n\nDuring the back-to-school season in September, Rednote launched an \"AI Guide\" campaign, inviting 20 professors to join a discussion on the app.\n\nRednote has gained more international users thanks to its AI translation feature, which enables users to translate posts from Chinese to English or other languages with a single click. And while most of the content that appears on Rednote is in Chinese, the app is increasingly featuring English content, including an AMA, or Ask Me Anything, event with Thomas Wolf, cofounder and chief science officer of Hugging Face.\n\nAn atmosphere of \"sincere sharing\" has fueled a trend of AI-themed AMAs on Rednote, said San Bing, Rednote's senior director of tech community.\n\nThe AMAs are popular because Rednote users are eager to learn about cutting-edge technology, said Peng, the founder of Recode China AI.\n\n\"For AMAs, you can get firsthand answers to tell you, what is the next frontier?\" Peng said.\n\nHave a tip?

    "description": "Jerome Powell will soon announce the next Fed decision on a potential interest rate cut. The Fed is missing key economic data on jobs and inflation.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve has one more decision in 2025 — and it will set the tone for where interest rates will go in the new year.\n\nOn Wednesday, leaders at the central bank will decide whether to continue cutting rates or put a pause on loosening monetary policy. The call will have ripple effects across consumer prices, the job market, and Corporate America. CME FedWatch predicted the Fed had a roughly 90% chance of a quarter-point cut on Monday.\n\nBut slicing rates isn't a sure thing. The final Federal Open Market Committee meeting of 2025 will follow the record-long government shutdown, which upended job stability for federal workers and disrupted data releases, including on unemployment and inflation. Even with the government open again, federal agencies like the Bureau of Labor Statistics continue to delay or have canceled their reports. It leaves the Fed's decision makers without a full picture of US economic health.\n\n\"The risk to the labor market's still there, the risks to inflation are still there, neither of which are necessarily a cause for alarm right now,\" Elizabeth Renter, senior economist at NerdWallet, told Business Insider, but \"the picture is cloudy.\"\n\nFed leaders are missing some key job and price data. Because BLS didn't collect new data during the shutdown, the agency can't publish the October consumer price index report or the October unemployment rate, and the November jobs report and inflation data won't be released in time for the December meeting.\n\nRenter said the murky economic picture may mean the Fed leans on last-minute data reports to make its decision. The job openings and labor turnover survey results and the employment cost index will be released on December 9 and December 10, respectively.\n\nThe delayed September jobs report that came out on November 20 showed that the US added more jobs than expected that month, and unemployment increased amid an increase in labor force participation. Cory Stahle, an economist at the Indeed Hiring Lab, told Business Insider that this doesn't mean the job market is reinvigorated or that the Fed's concerns over the labor market would immediately fade.\n\n\"We're still off to one of the worst starts we've had since 2010 after you take out the pandemic,\" Stahle said. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said in the last FOMC press conference that labor market conditions had \"not changed much\" between the Fed's September and October meetings.\n\nClaudia Sahm, the chief economist for New Century Advisors, expects the Fed to cut rates again, but wouldn't be surprised if members then decide to hold off for a while to see how the economy evolves. She also said there hasn't been much progress on cooling US inflation this year. After another cut to help with the job market, she expects a wait-and-see period before another rate cut, assuming there aren't drastic labor market changes.\n\n\"I have a feeling that if all goes well in the economy, the Fed probably is not going to be doing a whole lot because they took steps right now to ensure against the worst outcomes,\" Sahm said. \"Then it's just going to take time for the inflation to start moving back down.\"\n\nThe Fed has kept monetary policy restrictive so far this year, holding rates steady until September. But not all Fed leaders agree. Minutes from recent meetings show that some FOMC members would prefer larger and more consistent interest rate cuts. It's possible that monetary strategy could change in 2026, as Powell's term ends in May. President Donald Trump — who has been a vocal advocate for rate cuts — is likely to nominate a new Fed chair in January.\n\nA third consecutive cut would help make major purchases more affordable.\n\nThirty-year fixed mortgages, two-year auto loans, and credit card rates tend to fluctuate alongside the federal funds rate. And, while inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal, mortgage rates have largely cooled in recent months in anticipation of rate reductions.\n\nA quarter-point cut could mean lower returns on investment for savers using high-yield savings accounts or certificates of deposit, though it would become cheaper to pay off credit cards. Lower rates would also make home equity lines and small business loans more accessible to Americans.\n\nIf there is a cut, Renter said it could be a positive sign for people applying to roles in the sluggish labor market: If job seekers \"hear that the Fed is responding to an unfavorable labor market, that's going to feel good to them; they may feel like relief is on the horizon,\" she said.\n\nSustained rate cuts would bolster the job market by making it easier for businesses to borrow and invest money. This would free up more funds for companies to hire and pay employees, which could lead to higher consumer spending — all factors needed for a healthy economy.\n\nThough Powell said the Fed will be careful to balance jobs goals with curbing inflation. A rate change is likely this week, but \"not a foregone conclusion, far from it,\" he said. \"Policy is not on a preset course.\"",

    "description": "Tech stocks have driven a disproportionate share of the market's gains in recent years. Now, it might be time for them to share the limelight.",
    "fullText": "Tech stocks have driven a disproportionate share of the market's gains in recent years. Now, it's time for them to share the limelight, says Joe Quinlan, the chief market strategist at Bank of America.\n\n\"There's plenty of places to put money to work better other than, say, Mag 7,\" he said, referencing the largest stocks in the S&P 500 by market capitalization.\n\nSpecifically, cyclical stocks should start to look attractive next year, Quinlan said, calling the theme his highest-conviction investing idea right now, and recommending a barbell approach between tech and cyclical shares.\n\nCyclical stocks are those that rebound when the economy is recovering from a downturn or is expanding. Quinlan highlighted sectors like industrials, materials, and financials as places to look for opportunities.\n\nCyclicals may seem like a curious recommendation at the moment. The labor market appears to be softening, with rising layoffs and weaker job growth fueling concerns about a consumer-led slowdown. But Quinlan said that the job market is just learning to adjust to the new environment, not entering a downward spiral.\n\n\"The labor market is weakening in some parts, but it's strengthening in others, so it's really a mixed bag,\" he said. \"But the key is, companies are learning to live with the technology that comes with artificial intelligence, they're learning immigration constraints. It's just going to make us more productive, say, 18-24 months out.\"\n\nQuinlan pointed out several drivers that should propel economic growth in 2026 and boost cyclical stocks.\n\n\"It's continued consumer spending, particularly among higher income households; capital investment not just in data centers but also refurbishing, building out more factory capacity; a weaker dollar helps our exports; global growth is picking up, so that's good for multinational earnings,\" he said.\n\n\"And then you've got the fiscal and monetary stimulus: fiscally you're going to see a lot more money dropped in bottom lines because of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,\" Quinlan continued, adding that he sees two Federal Reserve interest rate cuts coming in 2026, starting mid-year, in addition to the cut that is widely expected in December. Rate cuts stimulate economic activity by encouraging borrowing and spending.\n\nStrategists at JPMorgan and HSBC have also said cyclical stocks are one of their preferred areas of the market to invest in next year amid robust projections for economic growth.\n\nYear-to-date, the industrials, materials, and financials sectors have returned 17.4%, 4.5%, and 10.8%, respectively. The S&P 500, by comparison, has risen 16.4% in 2025.\n\nSo far in 2025, cyclicals have outperformed defensive stocks, which get a boost from economic uncertainty, around the world. That recent rally has US cyclical stocks trading at a valuation premium relative to defensive stocks, as the below chart from Goldman Sachs shows.\n\nExamples of funds that offer exposure to cyclical stocks, particularly in Quinlan's preferred sectors, include the iShares U.S. Industrials ETF (IYJ), the State Street Materials Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLB), and the Vanguard Financials ETF (VFH).",

    "description": "Mark Rivers drives from Austin to Forth Worth every Monday at 2:45 a.m. to spend time at Canyon Ranch's corporate office. He became the CEO in 2023.",
    "fullText": "This as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with Mark Rivers, the CEO of Canyon Ranch, based in Austin. It's been edited for length and clarity.\n\nI've been the CEO of Canyon Ranch, a wellness hospitality company, since September 2023. Before that, I guided the company's new development opportunities starting in 2022.\n\nJoining Canyon Ranch capped off over 25 years of experience in hospitality operations and property development at other resorts and clubs. I was the original master developer of the campus that's now the Driftwood Golf & Ranch Club in Austin, a development principal of Solage Hotels and Resorts in Napa Valley, and an executive at the Steve Wynn-founded, Las Vegas-based Mirage Resorts.\n\nCanyon Ranch sits at the crossroads of hospitality and wellness. Wellness is certainly having its moment right now — and for a brand like ours, which was just named the best wellness resort in the Americas in 2025 by the Michelin Guide, this is a seminal moment to lead, redefine, and infuse our expertise and energy.\n\nWe have resorts in Tucson and Lenox, Massachusetts; the largest day spa in North America at The Venetian in Las Vegas; and a wellness club and spa in Fort Worth, Texas. We're also developing a new resort and residential community outside Austin.\n\nNot much can derail my day — I'm an optimist and highly motivated. I brush off the difficult, the impossible, and the stressful, and move on.\n\nHere's an idea of what a day in my life is like.\n\nOn a typical day, I wake up at 4 a.m., but on Mondays, I'm up at 2:45 a.m. to make the nearly three-hour drive from my home in Austin to our corporate office in Fort Worth. I live in Austin, and our company's biggest investment to date is the new resort we're building, so I like to be at or near it during most of the week.\n\nThe ride to work gives me time to listen to my favorite podcasts. My go-tos are usually Acquired or Founders, which have great insights on corporate brands and stories.\n\nIt's important to get the body moving, first and foremost.\n\nWhether at the office gym in Fort Worth or the fitness facilities at all our properties, I work out daily.\n\nI always hydrate before caffeine in the morning, stretch, and get my brain going with The New York Times Spelling Bee before dawn.\n\nI try to get some busy work and emails done early, before the day is overrun with meetings and the daily unexpected.\n\nThis is our fun morning ritual where we recreate a ranch tradition of brewed coffee served by our 'ranch hands' on staff — I can visit with coworkers and guests around a warm fire.\n\nWe meet in a eucalyptus courtyard in the center of the property. It's a warm, social morning gathering for guests and staff — a perfect way to start the day.\n\nWith properties and management sprinkled throughout the country, I'm frequently on the road visiting all of our locations. I prefer in-person human connection, but virtual meetings dominate.\n\nOn any given day, I probably have 10 to 12 meetings until 6 p.m., with a quick break for lunch.\n\nI grab a quick lunch from one of our dining outlets. These healthy, nutrient-packed meals help me with my mood and mental focus for the rest of the day.\n\nI love breakfast at almost any time of the day — egg scrambles with all sorts of veggies, a fruit bowl, or an oat bar snack.\n\nI also have an absolute sweet tooth — ice cream is a vice. I'm always grabbing coworkers and making a beeline for a quick ice cream.\n\nI try to spend time in Fort Worth with our leadership team, and balance the week between our properties and our new resort project in Austin.\n\nSpending time with our food-and-beverage, programming, spa, and health teams is especially rewarding — and it motivates me to maintain my diet and exercise regimen.\n\nOver the last couple of years, I've spent a few days each week at the 600-acre ranch, located west of Austin, where our newest resort and residential community will open in fall 2026.\n\nWe'll have the largest spa in Texas — a Women's Wellness Collective dedicated to well-being, featuring 141 rooms, outdoor adventures, and three dining outlets.\n\nI love the process of creating guest experiences, innovating and experimenting, and marshaling our teams to launch this new destination. It's something like a movie production with our cast, sets, script, imagination, and location.\n\nFor me, that means meetings with the architects and contractors, interior designers, and our teams on the campus.\n\nTennis has become a passion of mine, and I can play year-round with friends and pros in Texas.\n\nI'm not much of a TV or Netflix person, but I will follow some sporting events of my favorite teams: the Buffalo Bills, UConn Huskies, and Boise State Broncos. I share Buffalo Bills season tickets with my adult children.\n\nBefore settling in for sleep, I apply some sleep learnings and protocols from Longevity8, a program we recently launched that enables guests to enjoy a longer and healthier lifespan. I do a specific breathwork technique designed to trigger relaxation, which can be followed by journaling.\n\nTo keep my morning routine intact, I don't stay up late and barely drink alcohol. I'm early to bed — I'd rather have 4 a.m. to 6 a.m. to think, organize, and get ahead of the day than 9 p.m. to 11 p.m. for TV.",

    "fullText": "HOUSTON – Two businessmen are now in custody for allegedly violating U.S. export control laws, announced U.S. Attorney Nicholas J. Ganjei.\n\nAs part of the overall investigation, a Houston company and its owner have also pleaded guilty to smuggling cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence technology out of the United States.\n\n“Operation Gatekeeper has exposed a sophisticated smuggling network that threatens our Nation’s security by funneling cutting-edge AI technology to those who would use it against American interests,” said Ganjei. “These chips are the building blocks of AI superiority and are integral to modern military applications. The country that controls these chips will control AI technology; the country that controls AI technology will control the future. The Southern District of Texas will aggressively prosecute anyone who attempts to compromise America’s technological edge.”\n\n“The United States has long emphasized the importance of innovation and is responsible for an incredible amount of cutting-edge technology, such as the advanced computer chips that make modern AI possible,” said Assistant Attorney General for National Security John A. Eisenberg. “This advantage isn’t free but rather the result of our engineers’ and scientists’ hard work and sacrifice. The National Security Division, along with our partners, will vigorously enforce our export-control laws and protect this edge.”\n\nAlan Hao Hsu aka Haochun Hsu, 43, Missouri City, and his company, Hao Global LLC, both pleaded guilty to smuggling and unlawful export activities Oct. 10.\n\nAccording to now unsealed court documents, between October 2024 and May 2025, Hsu and others knowingly exported and attempted to export at least $160 million worth of export-controlled Nvidia H100 and H200 Tensor Core graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nThe H100 and H200 are high-speed GPUs used for AI applications and high-performance computing. They are designed to process massive amounts of data, advancing generative AI and large language models, and accelerating scientific computing. The GPUs are used for both civilian and military applications. These chips are among the most advanced GPUs ever developed, and their export to the People’s Republic of China is strictly prohibited.\n\nHsu and others falsified shipping paperwork, misclassifying the true nature of the goods and their recipients to conceal the ultimate destination of the GPUs. Hsu and Hao Global received more than $50 million in wire transfers that originated from the People’s Republic of China to help fund the scheme. The GPUs were ultimately shipped to the PRC, Hong Kong and other destinations in violation of U.S. export laws.\n\nAlso charged in relation to the scheme are two PRC natives - Fanyue Gong aka Tom Gong, 43, a PRC citizen who resides in Brooklyn, New York, and Benlin Yuan, 58, a Canadian citizen who resides in Mississauga, Ontario. Law enforcement arrested Gong in New York Dec. 3, and Yuan in Sterling, Virgina, Nov. 28.\n\nYuan is the CEO of a Sterling, Virginia, IT services company which is the U.S. subsidiary of a large PRC IT company based in Beijing, while Gong is the owner of a New York technology company.\n\nAccording to their charges, Gong and Yuan also independently conspired with employees of a Hong Kong-based logistics company and a China-based AI technology company to circumvent U.S. export controls.\n\nThe criminal complaint against Gong alleges co-conspirators obtained Nvidia GPUs through straw purchasers and intermediaries, falsely indicating that the goods were for U.S. customers or customers in third countries that do not require a license to export. The GPUs were shipped to multiple U.S. warehouses where individuals who worked for Gong removed Nvidia labels and re-labelled the GPUs with the name “SANDKYAN” – a fake company – and then prepared the goods for export at his direction, according to the charges. The shipping and export paperwork for the GPUs allegedly misclassified the goods as generic computer parts. The charges allege co-conspirators then shipped the goods or attempted to do so to the PRC and Hong Kong in violation of U.S. laws.\n\nAccording to Yuan’s charges, he helped recruit and organize individuals to inspect the mislabeled GPUs on behalf of the Hong Kong logistics company. Yuan allegedly agreed to direct inspectors not to say the goods were destined for the PRC. The charges also allege Yuan directed discussions regarding crafting a story his company could use to get GPUs and other equipment released after federal law authorities detained it. Yuan allegedly engaged in several conversations about providing false information to U.S. authorities regarding the ultimate customer of the goods.\n\nYuan is also alleged to have participated in and agreed to direct actions involving the handling and storage of another export of Nvidia GPUs on behalf of the Hong Kong logistics company.\n\nHsu faces up to 10 years in federal prison at sentencing Feb. 18, while Hao Global LLC could be fined up to twice the gross gain from the offense and given a term of probation.\n\nIf convicted, Yuan faces up to 20 years for conspiracy to violate the Export Control Reform Act. Gong is charged with conspiracy to smuggle goods from the United States and faces a maximum of 10 years.\n\nHsu was permitted to remain on bond pending sentencing. Yuan and Gong are currently in custody pending further criminal proceedings.\n\nThe Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security - Office of Export Enforcement (Dallas Field Office), Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s Homeland Security Investigations – Dallas and FBI Field Offices in New York City and Washington D.C. conducted the investigation. Assistant U.S. Attorneys John Marck and Mark McIntyre are prosecuting the case along with Trial Attorneys Fatema Merchant and Yifei Zheng of DOJ’s National Security Division’s Counterintelligence and Export Control Section.\n\nA criminal complaint is a formal accusation of criminal conduct, not evidence. A defendant is presumed innocent unless convicted through due process of law.",

    "description": "After the verdict came down, SHRM CEO Johnny C. Taylor addressed employees in a video, saying the judgment lacked merit.",
    "fullText": "Johnny C. Taylor, CEO of the Society for Human Resource Management, was heading to the trade group's annual holiday party on December 5 when he received bad news.\n\nIn a video sent to SHRM staff, Taylor described learning that a Colorado jury had just hit the organization with an $11.5 million verdict in an employee discrimination and retaliation case.\n\n\"While as a lawyer, you all know, I respect the judicial process, we vehemently disagree with the decision,\" Taylor said in the video, which was seen by Business Insider. He added that the case lacked merit and would go down as \"just a blip in the history of SHRM.\"\n\nHe also urged SHRM employees not to talk to the press about the case or any other company matters.\n\nThe case was filed by Rehab Mohamed, who worked at the organization as an instructional designer from 2016 to 2020.\n\nSHRM's holiday party was held at a Washington, D.C., restaurant called The Hamilton, according to two people, one of whom was an attendee.\n\nSHRM said in a LinkedIn post that it plans to file an appeal \"to the highest courts in the land,\" a response that has since drawn more than 100 comments, many of them critical.\n\n\"An $11.5 million verdict doesn't happen in a vacuum; it reflects patterns, dismissed concerns, and a lack of internal accountability,\" one user wrote.\n\n\"We understand the heightened attention surrounding this case because SHRM exists to advance workplace excellence. A verdict like this can create questions, and we take those concerns seriously,\" SHRM spokesperson Eddie Burke wrote in a statement to Business Insider. \"As an employer, we are appealing this verdict because our employees trust us to walk the walk. We maintain that the defendant in this case was not discriminated against.\"\n\nMohamed, whose lawyers have said she is Black and Egyptian, was awarded $1.5 million in compensatory damages and $10 million in punitive damages by the jury.\n\nThat amount meets the threshold of what is commonly known in the legal and insurance industries as a \"nuclear verdict.\"\n\nThe median federal race-discrimination verdict in a seven-year period ending in 2021 tracked by the legal data company Westlaw was $150,000. The largest such verdict in Westlaw's dataset was less than $7 million.\n\nThe size of the verdict \"is a staggering figure\" for an employee-discrimination case, said Allison Williard, an employment lawyer with Washienko Law Group in Boston. \"Getting a punitive damages award in and of itself is difficult because it is such a high bar to prove that the conduct at issue is extreme and outrageous.\"\n\nThe extraordinary award likely speaks to the jurors' understanding of how SHRM brands itself as an expert in HR best practices, Williard added.\n\n\"It's not unreasonable to think that they want to punish SHRM,\" she said. \"SHRM, of all organizations, really should have known better.\"\n\nIn September, SHRM asked the court to bar Mohamed from introducing evidence or argument that the organization is a specialist in HR best practices.\n\nUS District Judge Gordon P. Gallagher later denied SHRM's request, saying its \"asserted expertise in human resources is integral to the circumstances of this case and cannot reasonably be excluded.\"\n\nThe jury deliberated for about four and a half hours before delivering its verdict, said Ariel DeFazio, one of Mohamed's lawyers.\n\nCourt records show that jurors sent one note, asking two questions: \"Who receives punitive damages AND is there a formula or max value for punitive damages?\"\n\nThe impact of the case on SHRM's reputation could have harmful consequences for its more than 575 local chapters around the world, said the president of a US chapter, who asked not to be named due to concerns about retaliation.\n\nDescribing the verdict as \"mind-blowing,\" this person said they worry the chapter could lose both members and sponsors — sources of income that local affiliates need to survive.",

    "fullText": "Tiger Global's latest private investment fund will raise substantially less money than its predecessors from 2021 and 2022, but the $50 billion asset manager isn't worried.\n\nThe firm is expected to raise close to $2 billion for PIP 17, a person familiar with the manager told Business Insider.\n\nThat's a fraction of what PIP 14 and PIP 15 raised and aligns more closely to PIP 16, which closed in early 2024 with $2.2 billion in assets after aiming initially for $6 billion.\n\nWhile smaller fundraises typically coincide with a decline in investor interest, Tiger Global is confident that the size of the new fund will be a benefit for those who do decide to invest.\n\n\"Over our history, we have also found that smaller, more concentrated funds have been correlated with our strongest returns,\" the firm wrote in a letter to prospective investors that was seen by Business Insider.\n\nTiger Global declined to comment.\n\nThe first 10 private funds, the letter states, all raised less than $3 billion each, made fewer than 50 investments on average, and \"generated a 34% gross IRR and a 23% net IRR and made distributions exceeding investor commitments.\n\n\"We believe funds in this size range afford us significant benefits, particularly with respect to the impact midsize investments can make,\" the letter reads.\n\nIn other words, Tiger Global's aggressive venture style from 2020 through 2022, when the firm led fundraising rounds seemingly every week and raised increasingly larger funds, has been replaced with one that is closer to what the firm built its business on. The manager previously wrote to investors earlier this year about how it reworked its risk systems following a 56% loss in its public-equity flagship hedge fund and compared the firm's bounce-back from that loss to golfer Rory McIlroy's Masters win.\n\nThe most recent private fund, PIP 16, has already reaped some of the benefits of the style focused on \"high-conviction\" bets. The fund has invested 70% of its assets across 25 companies, the letter states, with the 10 largest investments accounting for three-quarters of that total.\n\nAmong those big bets are some of the world's prominent artificial intelligence companies, including OpenAI and Waymo.\n\n\"We have remained incredibly disciplined and selective\" when investing PIP 16, the firm wrote, and plan to continue that with PIP 17, which will hold its first close on March 18 next year. The new fund is the latest example of Tiger Global and its peers' renewed interest in private markets.\n\n\"This approach is opportunistic, guided by bottom-up, company-level underwriting, and informed by our deep research and cumulative insights,\" the letter states.\n\n\"To accomplish this, PIP 17 may have a pace of deployment spanning several years. With time on our side and an accelerated pace of innovation, we intend to remain patient — waiting for attractive opportunities to make high-conviction investments.\"",

    "fullText": "On Saturday, 22-year-old Fernando Mendoza led the Indiana Hoosiers to their first Big Ten championship since 1967 — but the top quarterback's professional résumé looks nearly as impressive as his football record.\n\nWith their 13-10 win over Ohio State, Indiana secured the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff for the first time in program history — and Mendoza's performance solidified his Heisman Trophy frontrunner status.\n\nBorn and raised in Miami, Mendoza was a two-star recruit out of high school and overlooked by most Power 4 programs. He was committed to playing at Yale until Cal lost a prospect and called him up with an offer he couldn't turn down: a free education and better football.\n\nAfter three seasons at Cal, where he worked his way up to starting quarterback and graduated from the prestigious Haas School of Business, he transferred to Indiana last winter. The move meant losing his scholarship with Cal, but earning a lot more money in endorsement deals.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, one of the first things he did with his \"name, image, likeness\" earnings was to cover the cost of the two classes he needed to graduate from Cal after his scholarship was terminated.\n\nMendoza, who's now pursuing his master's at Indiana's Kelley School of Business, spends more time on LinkedIn than he does on Instagram, TikTok, or other social platforms.\n\n\"The only social media that's on my phone right now is LinkedIn and YouTube to watch videos,\" he told The Herald Times. He has an Instagram account with more than 80,000 followers, but enlists his younger brother, Alberto, who also plays quarterback for the Hoosiers, to manage it.\n\nA post shared by HeraldTimesOnline (@heraldtimesonline)\n\nMendoza is a top prospect for the 2026 NFL draft, but if his football career doesn't pan out, he'd also be a top candidate for a job in finance.\n\nHe's spent his last few summers interning at real estate investment firms ACRE and Newmark. Juggling his internships with hours of football practice required a 5:30 a.m. wake-up call and an intricate whiteboard, where he'd keep a running list of action items.\n\nMendoza is just as disciplined with his money as he is with his schedule.\n\n\"He doesn't spend any money on himself,\" his mom told the WSJ. \"All he does is invest.\"\n\nA post shared by Big Ten Network (@bigtennetwork)\n\nHis brother, with whom he shared a room growing up and now shares a car, pointed out that he also doesn't like to spend money on gas.\n\nAlberto told Big Ten Network: \"I go to use the car, and it's empty. There's no more gas in the car, and I'm like, 'We're just gonna use the car and not fill it back up?' And Fernando is like, 'Oh, yeah, sorry, my bad.' … And then I have to go to the gas station on like one mile of gas.\"",

    "title": "Why RSS Matters",
    "description": "The future of the web depends on simple, open standards.",
    "fullText": "Yesterday morning, I woke up and checked my news app while still in bed. The headlines from ProPublica, The New York Times, and The Guardian loaded instantly: a curated stream of stories updated overnight. I scrolled through, tapped on a few pieces, then switched over to my podcast app to queue up something for my morning gym session. I queued up three new episodes: one from Search Engine, the first episode of the new ProPublica Narrated podcast, and an episode of Revolution.Social.\n\nA treadmill run later, I sat down at my laptop. Slack notifications ticked through updates for software we depend on, and Reeder showed me the latest from the publications and blogs I follow.\n\nThroughout my morning, I hadn’t visited a single source website directly. I hadn’t refreshed anything manually. Everything had just appeared, delivered automatically from each source to the app I'd chosen to read it in. My information diet runs on feeds.\n\nA single core standard powers all of it. When people think about RSS, they most often associate it with the long-departed Google Reader — but it’s far from dead. From direct subscriptions to syndication into apps that aggregate and re-present content, RSS remains the standard for feeds. It’s the glue that holds the timely web together.\n\nMost people know RSS powers blogs and podcasts. But it powers popular news apps too, from aggregated headlines on MSN or in SmartNews to up-to-date headlines in business services like Lexis Nexis or Bloomberg. It’s also widely used to keep track of status updates of all kinds: weather, software updates, infrastructure uptime, and so on. Most of this activity happens behind the scenes. Publishers often think of feeds as an afterthought, but entire industries rely on them. It’s a workhorse that's become essential infrastructure for the web.\n\nEven for something as simple as consuming news, RSS beats the alternatives. As Molly White wrote earlier this year:\n\nAnd yet, despite being everywhere, RSS is somehow invisible. It’s the plumbing of the web: essential, reliable, and routinely underestimated. Most people who consume news this way don't know they're using RSS, and a surprising number of people who work in media don't know they’re dependent on it for much of their reach and many of their partnerships.\n\nThat invisibility has created a misconception, in some quarters, that RSS is a relic. But the opposite is true: we’ve never relied on it more. And as the social web fractures, as platforms wall off content, and as AI agents begin remixing everything they can ingest, our dependence on neutral, open standards for distributing information is about to become existential.\n\nIt’s the strongest standard we have for feeds that syndicate content as published, without intermediation by third-party interests who seek to optimize for attention. Every RSS subscription represents a direct relationship between publisher and consumer, whether that consumer is a reader or a business partner.\n\nBut to be frank, it’s got terrible PR: it feels like a part of the old web (Google Reader, Web 2.0, Blogger, et al) even though it powers much of the modern one. And standards that enable direct publisher–reader relationships are inconvenient for companies whose business depends on sitting in the middle. Consequently, it’s under threat. The result will be that publishers will lose distribution sovereignty, and readers will lose one of the last tools that puts them, not algorithms, in control.\n\nIf we want an internet where publishers retain autonomy and readers retain agency, we need to treat RSS not as legacy plumbing but as strategic infrastructure. That means three things:\n\nIf your publishing platform was built with the open web in mind, it already supports RSS. WordPresspowers 43% of the web — including the website for my employer, ProPublica, and many other newsrooms — and has well-formed feeds built in. Similarly, platforms like Ghost were built with great feeds in mind. Even Medium, which puts much of its content behind a paywall, does a good job of providing feeds for its articles and publications. That’s important: although there’s been a lot of focus on email newsletters lately, I know that I receive more readers via RSS than email — and vastly more once I incorporate news portals that my site is syndicated to. Having a feed — or better, multiple feeds for topics, categories, etc — gives you a much bigger potential audience.\n\nBut not everything provides them. Beehiiv, the newsletter platform, supports the standard but leaves it off by default. Tracy Durnell has written a template letter to ask authors to turn it on. Sites built on services like Squarespace or Webflow often provide only rudimentary or crippled RSS feeds, if they offer them at all. And the newer generation of no-code or “vibe coding” tools frequently omit feeds entirely — not out of hostility, but because they don’t imagine syndication as part of the publishing experience. The result is predictable: content published on these platforms simply cannot travel. It won’t appear in aggregators, apps, readers, or enterprise workflows, and its reach is dramatically limited.\n\nWhere feeds are present, it’s important that they’re performant, and that they’re accessible to aggregators. Some sites provide feeds but accidentally block access through overactive use of bot or scraper prevention, negating the point of having them to begin with. On others, they take minutes to load. If you’re going to provide syndication, your feeds need to be snappy. They need to update as soon as new content is published. And they need to be available to all.\n\nIt’s also important to prioritize syndication methods that use RSS. For example, many “podcasts” have chosen to partner directly with streaming services rather than provide an open RSS feed. Whether these should even be called podcasts is in doubt; what’s not is that they’ve allowed those streaming services to intermediate their audiences. If they change their business priorities, those publishers could fully lose their audiences; it’s also a choice that weakens disintermediated freedom to \n\nFeeds have always been powerful for consumption. But the internet is a conversation, and the next generation of RSS-powered applications should unlock its potential for creation and collaboration. They should let publishers work together, readers become curators, and communities form around shared sources rather than platform feeds.\n\nThe good news is, we’re beginning to see what this could look like.\n\nI have a long-standing dream to create an open source newswire made up of non-profit news sources that allow their content to be republished for free. ProPublica is one; The 19th, the Markup, Grist, and a few others all allow their content to be syndicated for free on any other website under a Creative Commons license.\n\nWhat if you could read up-to-date content from all of these sources inside your own CMS and — with a click of a button — republish any articles you think your audience would enjoy? That, to me, is a non-obvious but exciting use of RSS feeds that would increase the reach and impact of these newsrooms and allow a thousand curation sites to flourish: local news hubs, topic-specific digests, niche expertise communities, and entirely new kinds of collaborative publications. In a world where platforms increasingly determine what audiences see, tools like this would let newsrooms collaborate on their own terms, without intermediaries.\n\nDave Winer’s Feedland is another interesting use of feeds: rather than keeping your subscriptions private, you can discover what your friends are subscribed to and, through them, find new publications and sources. In this world, the act of subscribing becomes the act of promoting sources you care about. It’s a social approach that comes close to following / followed lists on a traditional social media profile. A public subscription graph turns following into a decentralized discovery mechanism, with no algorithm or invisible ranking.\n\nWe also just need better, more fully-featured, less confusing consumer feed readers. Even apps like Reeder — my personal favorite — tend to complicate the experience by allowing you to pick multiple back-ends and  Feedly is loved by many, but positioned itself as a way to keep track of strikes and protests against your company a few years ago, marketing features to help companies monitor and respond to labor organizing. Even beyond this distasteful misstep, it has tried to be a corporate signals platform rather than a consumer tool.\n\nWe need a beautiful, straightforward feed reader designed for consumers who don’t care about the underlying technology but know they don’t want someone else’s algorithm getting between them and the content they want to read. In other words, we need a feed reader designed for the mainstream — not just the power users who remember Google Reader.\n\nWhat these approaches share is a commitment to keeping power distributed. Unlike platform-based solutions, they don't require anyone to sit in the middle. Publishers retain control, readers retain choice, and the infrastructure remains open to anyone who wants to build on it.\n\nOne of RSS’s biggest strengths is how simple it is. You can build an RSS-powered app in an afternoon. That means it’s easy to pick up, it’s easy to innovate with, and a new ecosystem of apps can build quickly. We just need some tentpole services to organize around.\n\nRSS doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Over the past few years, a new generation of social web protocols has emerged — ActivityPub, AT Protocol, Nostr, and others — all of which share a basic intuition: the future of online communication should be decentralized, interoperable, and user-controlled.\n\nActivityPub, the protocol that powers Mastodon and much of the fediverse, is built around the idea of following updates from actors you care about. AT Protocol, which underpins Bluesky, lets users move their identity and social graph between services. Nostr focuses on simple, portable events that anyone can publish and anyone can All of these ecosystems are built on the premise that you should be able to read — and move — your social world wherever you like.\n\nIn fact, Mastodon and Bluesky both support RSS feeds, and make it relatively easy (if you know the feature exists) to follow peoples’ profiles in a feed reader. That means you don’t need to be a Mastodon or Bluesky member to follow profiles you care about: you can just plug them into your reader of choice. And those platforms don't need to be a part of an interaction at all. If you have both inbound feeds and a feed of your own content publishing out, without heavy requirements for metadata, that’s a fairly complete social web in its own right.\n\nThis implies another opportunity, which is still relatively untapped: RSS can serve as a simple layer of connective tissue between today’s social protocols. It’s already universal, already well understood, and already deployed everywhere. Rather than reinventing syndication for each protocol, we could treat RSS as the common denominator. RSS lacks the complexity of ActivityPub or AT Protocol, which is a core strength. It’s a simple, universal transport format that everything can speak.\n\nIf the social web of the past decade was defined by walled gardens and algorithmic feeds, the next decade could be defined by interoperable layers, where RSS plays the same role for publishing that SMTP plays for email: a basic, universal substrate that everything else can build on.\n\nThe important thing about the open social web is not which protocol “wins.” It’s whether we build an ecosystem where publishers keep control of their distribution and readers keep control of their attention. RSS remains one of the strongest tools we have to make that possible.\n\nRSS has always worked quietly in the background. In a moment when the web is being reshaped by enclosure, consolidation, and algorithmic mediation, its reliability is exactly what we need. It offers a simple, durable way for publishers to keep control of their distribution and for readers to keep control of their attention, without permission, platform lock-in, or hidden agendas. If we treat RSS not as a relic of an earlier web but as the strategic infrastructure it already is, it can continue to anchor a more open, more resilient, and more humane internet for decades to come.",

    "title": "A Rivian spin-off is betting $305 million on e-bikes. I rode it around New York City, and it felt natural — and powerful.",
    "description": "I use my steel Fuji road bike for everything. So when I heard about a new e-bike from Rivian spin-off Also, I couldn't resist trying it out.",
    "fullText": "Many Americans view cars as a necessity. But for me, and millions of other people, bikes are how we get where we need to go.\n\nMy steel Fuji road bike is like another limb. I use it to get to work, grab groceries, and pedal to see my friends. I can haul it onto the subway if I get tired, or if the weather takes a surprise turn for the worse. It's cheap to maintain, and I can use it in place of a gym membership.\n\nIn New York City, where I live, e-bikes — the road bike's zoomier cousin — are everywhere. They're not just popular with the 135,000 members of Citibike, our city's bike-share program; businesses have also embraced them. Many delivery workers use e-bikes to avoid our city's awful traffic snarls, and giants like Amazon use them to drop off packages and reduce emissions.\n\nSo when one of my colleagues told me they'd been getting emails from Also, a new e-bike company, I couldn't resist hopping in the saddle. I've been thinking about buying an e-bike, and the emails said Also's bike, the TM-B, had some unique features. The fact that it had been spun out of Rivian, a $21 billion electric vehicle company, intrigued me.\n\nRivian has retained a minority stake in Also — as in, \"you can drive a car, and you can also ride a bike.\" Also uses the same battery cells as Rivian's autos, and takes inspiration from the carmaker's drive for simplicity. While many e-bikes are manufactured by traditional bike makers, Also sticks exclusively with electric-powered products. It has raised $305 million, according to Pitchbook.\n\nJust before Thanksgiving, I met up with Saul Leiken, Also's director of product, to learn about the new $4,500 TM-B and take it for a spin around Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood.\n\nI came away surprised at how flexible it was, and thinking it could be a good add-on — or primary method of transportation — for many households across the US.\n\nAll e-bikes are complex pieces of machinery compared to normal bikes. In pedal-assist modes — when the motor only kicks in when you turn the pedals — the bike needs some way to process and interpret how hard you're pedaling to decide how much to help you. Those sensors need to be able to \"talk\" to the motor.\n\nThe TM-B, which stands for \"Transcendant Mobility Bike,\" operates on an entirely different level from your typical e-bike. The pedals don't connect to a chain; they power a generator and provide input to a computer system that tells the motor how much juice to give the bike, a system the company calls \"DreamRide.\" If there are updates, they'll be delivered over-the-air, like with your smartphone — or, increasingly, your car.\n\n\"Everything's software-defined,\" said Leiken, who also joined me on a test ride.\n\nIt struck me how digitized everyday transportation is becoming. Even gas-burning cars don't have direct, mechanical links between the steering wheel and the wheels or even the gas pedal and the engine. It's all digital, or \"drive by wire.\" That makes the TM-B \"pedal by wire.\"\n\nI started out riding the TM-B in \"All Purpose\" mode. I relied on pedal assist, and I changed the levels by tapping a small screen at the top of the bike's head tube. It didn't feel like I was giving instructions to a computer; it felt like I was pedaling.\n\nThe part of Manhattan we were riding in was pretty flat, and it was a somewhat chilly day. Even if I'd been using a normal bike, I probably would not have broken a sweat. But the assist from the DreamRide would be welcome on a warmer day, and I could see it propelling me over the Manhattan Bridge if I wanted to get to Brooklyn without much effort.\n\nLater on, we tried the TM-B's \"Sport\" mode, which approximates the experience of a standard, geared bicycle. There's no chain to clank around to let you know you've switched gears, but there is haptic feedback, just like on your smartphone, that courses through the pedals.\n\nState and local e-bike regulations are evolving, but in most states, there are three classes of e-bike, and the TM-B is what's called a \"Class 3\" e-bike, capable of hitting speeds up to 28 miles per hour. That's about as fast as a car will ever go in most places in New York City, except for a highway or a boulevard in one of the outer boroughs — in the middle of the night.\n\nI inched toward that top speed at a couple of points during our 30-minute ride. Once, early on, I cranked the pedal-assist level to its max. I was only going in the mid-20s, but still beating traffic because bikes are simply more nimble than cars, until we hit a red light.\n\nLater, when we were going west along a large block, I remembered to hit the throttle — a little orange button near my right thumb designed to take me up to 20 miles per hour.\n\nIt gave me a real rush; it felt almost like riding a motorbike, which I hadn't done in years. At the same time, I knew I had to be attentive, for my own safety and that of others.\n\nNationwide, estimated e-bike sales are between 1 million and 2 million a year. It's hard to be precise, partly because the market has so many players, and partly because customs data is incomplete and lumps e-bikes into a larger category of imports, according to eCycle Electric, a consulting firm. What's clear is that it's growing: eCycle predicts that sales will grow 14% to 25% per year until 2030.\n\nSome e-bike companies have run into trouble. Recently, Techcrunch reported that Rad Power Bikes, which says it has 680,000 customers, could run out of money by January 2026. VanMoof, a Dutch e-bike brand whose sleek rides stood apart from competitors with chunky batteries and conspicuous wiring, went bankrupt in 2023, and its new owners are trying to reestablish themselves.\n\nWhen I asked Leiken about this, he said Also's timing was better — some e-bike companies built too much during the pandemic and were desperate to unload inventory afterward — and its business model is less reliant on partners. The bike's adaptability struck me as a potential selling point, too: It can ride on roads, rutted streets, and trails, and can be used for a workout or a quick errand.\n\nSome things about the bike weren't final. The bell is digital, emitted by a speaker, and Leiken told me they were considering tweaking the tone and modifying it so that, if you hit it hard, it would sound like a car horn. It reminded me of how electric car manufacturers have created custom sounds to alert pedestrians at low speeds, as required by federal regulations.\n\nAlso has also rolled out a helmet, called the Alpha Wave. It has built-in front and rear lights meant to catch drivers' attention, speakers, and a noise-cancelling mic. While simple bike helmets provide some degree of protection in case of a collision, Also's helmet has a new technology called the Release Layer System that's meant to reduce the risk of traumatic brain injury.\n\nThere's a learning curve to bike ownership, and Also seems focused on flattening that curve.\n\nWhile I didn't have the controls down pat in a roughly 30-minute ride, I felt completely safe the whole time, and I'm sure I would've gotten the hang of it in another hour. For a novice rider, it might take longer, and it would be smart to start in a park or a parking lot before mixing with traffic.\n\nOne of the more intriguing aspects of the bike was its swappable \"top frames.\" With a couple of taps, you can replace the seat with one for a much larger or much smaller rider. You can also swap in a roomier bench seat, or a seat with a utility rack to schlep cargo or a kid. It slots in like a ski boot, with a mechanical lock and an electrical connection to power the back lights on the bike. I'm not aware of any e-bikes with a similar feature.\n\nThe point of the TM-B wasn't just to create a fun ride, Leiken said. It was to further the idea of \"bikes as transportation\" — as something that can actually replace a car for local trips. While $3,500 is nothing to sneeze at, Leiken said the company wanted to bring a \"super-premium feature set and experience\" to riders. He said bikes with similar features are usually more like $8,000. Besides, a used car will set you back $25,000 on average, and an average new car is $50,000.\n\nI've long thought that e-bikes are generally good to have in society, and that they could replace a great deal of car trips. I've occasionally mulled buying one, but I feel like, as a fit person in my 30s, it might be overkill.\n\nThe TM-B didn't radically change my mind. I'm still undecided on buying an e-bike — I really love my Fuji road bike — but it could be good for someone who wants an e-bike that can do it all. It's a flexible workhorse, and given how pricey cars are getting, I think a lot of people could justify the price tag.",

    "fullText": "Worried about how AI is affecting your job? You're not alone.\n\nEveryone from the board to management to employees has concerns about the new technology, said Joe Atkinson, PwC's global head of AI, in an appearance on CNBC's Squawk Box Asia on Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a complex time in the world of AI implementation,\" said Atkinson. The pace of AI change is \"overwhelming to everybody\" and there's a \"mismatch\" between how quickly organizational change can keep up with it, he said.\n\nGlobal companies routinely look to PwC, one of the industry's leading consulting and accounting firms, for answers to their most consequential business questions. With AI rapidly transforming how businesses operate, guidance on reorganizing for an AI-first future is becoming one of the most sought-after offerings.\n\nAtkinson said that the next phase of implementing AI inside companies is scaling the technology's capabilities, and companies that move quickly will see the most reward.\n\n\"We've talked for the last year about proofs of concept and experimentation, and frankly, those days are over. We now have to scale the impact of AI in organizations,\" Atkinson said.\n\n\"The good news for employees is if we scale the impact of AI for organizations, I truly believe we create and unlock growth,\" he added.\n\nAccording to PwC's data, organizations that adopt AI more quickly have seen three times the revenue per employee compared to those that proceed more slowly.\n\n\"That opportunity means that it's not only a big upside for organisations. It is a big upside for employees who lean in and use these tools to help create greater productivity, outputs, and creativity,\" Atkinson said.\n\nPwC and other leading consulting firms have embraced AI, pitching themselves as client zero for the solutions they offer to clients and implementing AI solutions across all operations.\n\nNew hires at PwC will be doing the roles that managers are doing within three years because of AI, Jenn Kosar, PwC's AI assurance leader, told Business Insider in August.\n\nThe technology is also affecting the firm's hiring plans. In August, Business Insider obtained part of an internal presentation showing that PwC US planned to cut graduate hiring by a third over the next three years, in part due to \"the impact of AI.\"\n\nHave a tip?

    "fullText": "If you had to pick a defining driver of the stock market over the first several months of 2025, it would probably be President Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nThen the middle section of the year was overtaken by the red-hot AI trade, which pushed the S&P 500 more than 20% higher from May through October.\n\nSince late October, however, there's been one indisputable driver of stock returns in the US: the Federal Reserve. With the central bank set to start its two-day policy meeting today — and with its next interest-rate decision due tomorrow — it's rightfully commanding the majority of investor attention.\n\nSince the Oct. 29 FOMC meeting, the equity-market playbook has been simple: signals of future rate cuts have been stocks-positive, while any hawkishness has been greeted with selling.\n\nThe chart below shows the dynamic in action, with a hawkish Fed decision marking the recent market top and sparking a prolonged sell-off, only for dovish comments to right the ship and push the index back near record highs.\n\nWith all of this activity around the Fed, the AI trade remains formidable. The stock prices of mega-cap tech titans have, however, been increasingly dictated by the shifting sands of monetary policy. These companies have a lot riding on their ability to borrow at favorable rates, so they can keep spending tens of billions on AI. This informs the V shape in the chart above.\n\nWith odds of a 25-basis-point cut currently set at 87%, it seems all but certain that a December cut is coming. That's probably not what's going to move the market on Wednesday, or serve as another inflection point for stocks.\n\nWhat investors will be focused on is signals of further rate cuts to come. There's only a 23% chance of another cut in January being implied right now. The odds for a second cut by the March Fed meeting are only slightly higher, at 37%.\n\nBased on those percentages, investors aren't asking for much. Maybe a few dovish breadcrumbs will hold them over.\n\nBut will the Fed play ball? The expectation is that they'll take a largely data-dependent stance, and kick the can down the road until more economic figures are available. How investors digest that will likely dictate the stock market's direction over the next few weeks.",

OpenAI and Anthropic did not immediately respond to requests for comments on whether their reports are peer-reviewed.\n\nDespite the reports, skepticism still swirls about whether the technology is actually making workers more productive. An August study by MIT found that most companies saw no measurable return on their investments in generative AI.\n\nA paper published by Stanford and Harvard University in September said that many professionals are churning out \"workslop,\" referring to AI-generated content that looks polished but fails to move tasks forward.

    "fullText": "As a true breakfast lover, I often go to bed excited to wake up and eat my first meal of the day. To me, sleep is a fast track to breakfast.\n\nBecause the first bite of food is such a source of joy, I like to mix up the menu — there are far too many delicious options to limit myself.\n\nThat said, one breakfast remains a year-round staple: my overnight oats.\n\nMy overnight oats are the perfect way to start the day, providing protein, slow-release energy, carbs, healthy fats, and tons of micronutrients.\n\nThis recipe helped me lose 35 pounds seven years ago and has played an instrumental role in helping me continue to reach my health goals.\n\nI still eat it about three times a week and never get bored because I can make so many different flavor combinations.\n\nPlus, knowing my breakfast is already made when I get into bed adds to the excitement.\n\nThere are several ways to make overnight oats, but I've perfected my version over the years. For one portion, my classic overnight oats consist of:\n\nSimply mix everything except the toppings together in a container or bowl, cover, chill in the fridge overnight, and remove it the next morning.\n\nAdd some berries and nut butter to dress up the oats. If I'm using frozen berries, I add them the night before so they can defrost overnight as well.\n\nTake the above measurements as recommendations and experiment until you find your preferred consistency — just keep in mind that the oats will thicken overnight.\n\nIf you want same-day oats, a few hours in the fridge will do the trick. This recipe also keeps for a few days.\n\nAs tasty as my overnight oats are, they also provide tons of health benefits.\n\nI had registered nutritionist Rhiannon Lambert review my recipe, and she said that it creates a \"well-balanced, nutrient-dense breakfast.\"\n\n\"The recipe offers slow-release energy from the oats, a good amount of protein from Greek yogurt, plus probiotics from the kefir,\" Lambert said.\n\n\"It's also rich in fiber, likely providing around 10 to 14 grams per serving, which supports digestion, gut health, and even broader aspects of our health, like immunity and mood.\"\n\nMy overnight oats contain probiotic foods (kefir provides beneficial live cultures) and prebiotic fibers from the oats, chia seeds, and fruit, which help nourish gut bacteria.\n\nLambert also offered a few pointers on how to enhance this recipe based on your specific goals:\n\nTips aside, feel free to vary the flavor of the oats to keep things interesting. Depending on the season and available produce, I add fresh peaches, dried apricots, cherries, almond butter, or pumpkin purée.\n\nSome of my favorite combinations are:\n\nRegardless of which version I make, starting my day with a combination of whole grains, fruit, seeds, and fermented foods keeps me energized until lunch.",

    "fullText": "Last year, my dad retired from his insurance job of 30 years. At 65, he said he'd done the desk job long enough and was ready to get out and about.\n\nIt was a combination of all the sitting and the feelings he had about selling insurance that caused him to leave — when he began, it felt like he was helping people. Then at some point, he started to feel like he was working for The Man. He worked until he was old enough to retire, then got two part-time jobs doing busy work around town.\n\n\"Toward the end, I wasn't sure if I would miss it or not,\" he told me. \"But it turns out I didn't miss it at all.\"\n\nA week after retirement, he'd landed a part-time job in customer service. He works at a local meat market where they process, package, and sell fresh cuts of meat. He packages everything from bacon to snack sticks to bones for broth.\n\n\"Maybe people give them to their dogs, I don't know what they do with the bones, I just bag them,\" he said, laughing.\n\nRetired now for just over a year, he said he enjoys the ability to be social and on his feet, while still earning side money. He now receives both Social Security and money from an annuity from his insurance job, while my mom has yet to hit the age threshold to receive money from Social Security or retirement accounts.\n\nHis hourly wage, he said, helps pay the bills and allows for \"extras\" like spoiling his grandkids, taking everyone out to eat, or attending events out of town, whether it's just him and my mom, or the entire crew.\n\nEach week, he writes out his preferred schedule and sends a picture to his boss via text. It varies between 20-25 hours, he said.\n\nApparently, the company is busy enough that they will take what they can get from him. There are 32 other employees, though he said he only works with a few at the same time.\n\nHe also works at a local eating club where he pours drinks and opens beers for patrons, most of whom are his friends.\n\n\"I know everybody's name who walks through the door,\" he said. \"There are only a few that were new, and now I've gotten to know them, too.\"\n\nHe said the combination works because he can set his own schedule.\n\n\"That's the beauty of it — I come home, and I'm chillaxing for two and a half hours,\" he said. \"I sit in my chair and just chill, so that helps a lot. I'm pretty blessed making it work for my schedule.\"\n\nA former marathon runner, he's health-conscious and prefers standing over sitting. \"I'm up on my feet vs. sitting all day. Sometimes I stand in one place and work, but it's good for me to be upright,\" he said.\n\nHe prefers to walk to keep his back loose; standing still for too long causes it to become tight and painful, he said. He also wears thick foam shoes. \"They're like two inches on the sole; it didn't take me long to figure out I would need something like that,\" he said.\n\nHe also enjoys getting to see different people.\n\n\"For as long as I enjoy it and I'm physically able to work, I'll keep doing it,\" he said. \"There'll come a time when I won't be physically able to do it, but right now is not that time. It keeps me busy, and I like seeing everyone; it's fun.\"",

    "fullText": "It’s time we stopped flinching at the assaults of the far right—and started fighting back.\n\nOver the past year, I’ve noticed a pattern among some of my colleagues in public health, biomedical research, and the university settings in which I work.\n\nIt’s a strange, reflexive tic: Faced with bad-faith criticism from malign actors, we shrink back, saying, “Oh, it’s not you. It’s me,” and walk onto their terrain with accommodation in our hearts.\n\nSome may think that, faced with the full fury of the far right, some kind of retreat is the only option. But walking further and further into the mouth of the Leviathan only serves to make you dinner for a very large fish.\n\nIn public health, the reigning trope is that over the past five years, we have lost the trust of ordinary Americans, largely coinciding with the response to the Covid pandemic. It’s an uncritical analysis that we eat up like candy—I have been in so many discussions and heard so many talks about how we need to “regain” or “rebuild” trust—and I think we have to stop and reflect for just a moment.\n\nDavid Wallace-Wells wrote a piece in The New York Times that may indicate that our own conventional wisdom about these matters may be wrong:\n\nThe poll, published in The Argument with the headline “The Covid Political Backlash Disappeared,” showed that respondents largely supported mitigation policies, at least in retrospect. Despite conventional wisdom about public health resentment and liberal overreach, mitigation policies do not appear to have disproportionately cost the Democrats, who were graded more positively than Republicans in their handling of the pandemic and rated more highly on matters of personal health; despite criticism about school closures so pervasive that national Democrats now reflexively apologize for them those closures are still seen by most as having been largely necessary at the time; and although the pandemic experience has damaged confidence in vaccines when it comes to routine shots, the country remains pretty anti-anti-vaccine, with 77 percent of respondents telling The Argument’s pollsters they’d advise friends to follow the standard vaccination schedule and only 15 percent saying they’d advise against it.\n\nWhat Wallace-Wells doesn’t mention here is that much of the conventional wisdom about “public health resentment and liberal overreach” was also the product of a manufactured smear campaign by the right. I’ve written about this before, and Walker Bragman and Alex Kotch have chronicled the far right’s hijacking of the war on Covid since the beginning. Yet too many of my colleagues are like small mammals hypnotized by snakes—mesmerized into submission, in this case, by far-right rhetoric. Yes, we can all agree that public health needs criticism, an analysis of the response to the pandemic included, but we can do better without going belly-up. We’ve got to stop apologizing for the work we do, and take a far less naïve view of the criticisms of public health and separate what is real and substantial from what is ginned-up agit-prop.\n\nWhile some university presidents (at Michigan, Penn and elsewhere) have rolled back DEI programs, Democratic politicians like Gavin Newsom and Pete Buttigieg have decided that trans Americans are politically expendable, and some liberal pundits like Ezra Klein are pushing for (more) Democratic pro-life candidates, in public health and biomedicine, these are issues on which we have to move from “no apologies” to “no surrender.”\n\nRace, gender, and sexuality may be a third rail of American politics for some, but for those of us in public health and biomedicine, these issues are central to our work, and improving the health and well-being of Americans depends on facing them head-on. Jay Bhattacharya, the director of the National Institutes of Health, has made it a mission to destroy research on health disparities in America, even as he speaks out of both sides of his mouth by praising work “that advances the health and well-being of minority populations.” Thousands of grants for work looking at the interaction of race and health outcomes across the country have been terminated. RFK Jr. has slashed the budget and staffing at offices that address minority health in the US at the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the Health Resources and Services Administration, and at the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Yet, as Mary Bassett, the former health commissioner of New York City and now a professor at the Harvard School of Public Health, has said: “There hasn’t been a single year since Colonial America that the population of Black America hasn’t died younger and died sicker than white America.” Research on and programmatic work to rid us of these gross inequities in health outcomes has to remain a priority for us in public health and biomedical research; otherwise, we are practicing a form of apartheid-style science, where only white lives matter.\n\nAnd this leads us to DEI programs that are meant to ensure that we address the barriers to opportunities in our field. This is an indispensable goal for at least two reasons. The first one is simply pragmatic—we do not know where new insights will come from, so we need to actively recruit talent from every quarter. Pretending that everyone starts their journeys from the same place in our society is farcical. Access to opportunity in the US is tied to race and ethnicity, income, and family background, and it is not a level playing field. As Stephen Jay Gould said in The Panda’s Thumb: “I am, somehow, less interested in the weight and convolutions of Einstein’s brain than in the near certainty that people of equal talent have lived and died in cotton fields and sweatshops.” In a world that has just experienced the worst epidemic in a century, and with the effects of climate change only getting worse, we need everyone off the bench and in the fight. And having a more diverse workforce in public health and biomedicine is important for another reason: There are key discoveries in health disparities that have come from Black and brown researchers, including uncovering the problems with race-adjusted scoring for kidney function, the danger for black mothers of maternal risk algorithms, and the complex issues associated with cardiovascular disease risk assessment among black patients and at the population level, the role of race in disparities in hypertension, diabetes, and all-cause mortality. In infectious diseases, my own field, it was W.E.B. Du Bois himself over a century ago who examined disparities in TB, syphilis, and pneumonia among Black Americans and ascribed these differences to social and economic conditions, discrimination, and racism.\n\nOn sexuality and gender? I work in HIV—the termination of grants and programs on LGBTQ health, particularly trans health, endangers lives full-stop. President Trump, in his 2019 State of the Union address, announced his landmark initiative to End the HIV Epidemic (EHE), and later that month the CDC announced that HIV prevention efforts had stalled out—EHE couldn’t have come at a better time. Almost seven years later, Trump has pulled the plug on LGBTQ health. Trans Americans have some of the highest rates of HIV in this country. Comprehensive care, including gender-affirming hormone therapy, is vital in stemming infections among this vulnerable group. Furthermore, gender-affirming care is “an integral determinant of trans people’s well-being.” Throwing trans people under the bus is bad medicine and bad public health and we should speak up on behalf of our trans sisters and brothers and call out attacks on this community when we see it. Trump and his cronies aren’t interested in the health and well-being of trans Americans; they see another set of people to demonize and target. Remaining silent is being complicit in this scapegoating, increasing health risks for close to 3 million of our fellow citizens. Finally, in the wake of Dobbs, millions of women are now at increased risk of suffering and death as abortion becomes illegal in state after state across the country. It’s a well-known epidemiological fact that legally induced abortion is far safer for pregnant people than childbirth. It isn’t even close: “the pregnancy-associated mortality rate among women who delivered live neonates was 8.8 deaths per 100,000 live births. The mortality rate related to induced abortion was 0.6 deaths per 100,000 abortions.” No matter what you personally think about abortion, interfering with the medical care of pregnant people is a bad public health move. Given that close to a quarter of all women in the US access abortion care in their lifetime, state restrictions on this vital part of medical care risk lives.\n\nAll of these are issues we must hold the line on, not cave over. The instinct to meet people halfway, to compromise, is not a terrible one. But when compromise is the goal in and of itself, it turns out you stand for little or nothing. In the case of the struggles for the future of public health and medicine in this country, this desire to placate the far right has too many people simply shifting their own views to the right. That is, the compromise isn’t really a compromise at all when it’s a one-way affair; it’s a capitulation. So many millions of lives are at stake right now, thanks to policies coming out of this administration. Giving in is giving these people up. And these people are those we have pledged to serve—whether we’re healthcare workers or on the frontlines of public health. We can try to justify this kind of accommodation in any way we want, but in the end, it’s hard to see it as anything but a Judas kiss.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump has opened the door for tiny cars to be sold in the US — and now Stellantis is bringing an Italian mini car to American shores.\n\nThe auto conglomerate, which owns Jeep and Ram, confirmed on Monday that it would bring the Fiat Topolino — a 2.5-meter-long electric tiny car — to the US.\n\nSpeaking at an event in Michigan, Fiat CEO Olivier Francois said the Topolino's display appearances in the US had sparked \"tremendous excitement,\" adding that the company would share more details about the tiny car's US launch next year.\n\nThe Topolino, which means \"little mouse\" in Italian, is a major departure from the gas-guzzling big trucks that dominate US roads.\n\nBuilt by Italian brand Fiat, the compact city car has a max range of around 47 miles and a top speed of 28 miles per hour.\n\nWeighing less than a golf cart, it's technically classified as an electric quadricycle rather than a car, meaning that it can be driven from age 14 in some European countries.\n\nThe Topolino is available throughout Europe and costs around 9,900 euros ($11,500) in its home market of Italy. Its impending US launch follows a sudden burst of support for tiny cars from an unlikely source — Trump.\n\nThe US president expressed admiration for Japan's pint-sized Kei cars after a recent trip to the country.\n\nTrump described the mini electric models, which are hugely popular in Japan, as \"very cute\" and \"beautiful,\" and said last week that he had loosened regulations to allow manufacturers to build them in the US.\n\nA Stellantis spokesperson told CNBC the announcement of the Topolino's US launch was unrelated to Trump's comments. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider.\n\nKei cars have developed an enthusiastic cult following in the US, but the vehicles don't meet federal auto standards and can only be imported if they're over 25 years old.\n\nKei cars also face a patchwork of state regulations, with some states limiting them to low speeds or prohibiting them from being driven on public roads entirely.",

    "description": "With the proliferation of drones on the battlefield in Ukraine, European militaries are racing to better arm their forces.",
    "fullText": "European militaries are showing growing interest in a technology that turns standard service rifles into last-resort drone killers, an Israeli weapons maker says, as countries look for cheaper ways to counter the surge in uncrewed systems.\n\nA representative of firearms manufacturer Israel Weapon Industries told Business Insider that at least 10 European countries have either purchased or shown interest in the Arbel system, a micro-computer intended to better optimize a gun for shooting down drones, since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine began in 2022.\n\nIWI declined to name buyers and interested parties. But Europe has grown increasingly interested in anti-drone defenses.\n\nDrones have dominated the battlefield in this war, providing Ukraine and Russia with constant surveillance and precision-strike capabilities. As both sides develop cheap ways to deal with the threat, countries closely watching the conflict from the sidelines are investing in the same.\n\nIWI said that its Arbel system is already in use with an undisclosed number of militaries around the world, said Semion, the head of Europe for the company, who requested to be identified only by his first name for security reasons.\n\nHe said that by next year, given current trends, he expects that 40 to 50% of European countries will either have procured the Arbel system or be close to doing so, reflecting growing investment in cost-efficient anti-drone defenses across the continent.\n\nDrones of all shapes, sizes, and functions are playing key roles on the battlefield in Ukraine, but one of the most problematic for soldiers on both sides is the small quadcopter known as a first-person-view (FPV) system.\n\nFPV drones are often armed with explosives that turn them into inexpensive precision-strike weapons. To defeat them, soldiers use signal jamming to interfere with their signal connections.\n\nHowever, FPV drones are increasingly being controlled by fiber-optic cables that connect directly with an operator rather than radio frequencies, making them immune to electronic warfare. The only option is to shoot them down with small arms, but even that requires precision and a lot of luck.\n\nDrones are hard targets to hit, in many cases, with anything other than a shotgun, and even then, there's no guarantee. They can move quickly and in unexpected ways.\n\nWith drones cementing themselves as a permanent feature of the modern battlefield, militaries are racing to acquire personal anti-drone defenses, like Arbel, in case soldiers find themselves on the receiving end of one of these weapons.\n\nArbel is a tiny computerized system that can be integrated into light machine guns or assault rifles, giving a soldier a more accurate shot on the battlefield in scenarios that require quick reactions or against moving targets — such as small drones, Semion said.\n\nWhen activated, the system lets a soldier hold down the trigger while Arbel automatically releases rounds at the moments they're most likely to hit the target. It can bring down drones at roughly 450 meters in daylight and 200 meters at night.\n\nThe system's sensors study the shooter's behavior — their weapon movement, stability, and trigger pressure. With the trigger held down, all the soldier needs to do is keep the drone in their sight; Arbel decides exactly when each round should go.\n\nArbel is battery-powered and adds about 400 grams to the gun, and soldiers can adapt quickly. Semion said the system is inexpensive but declined to disclose any specifics on the cost.\n\nSemion likened the system to equipping a soldier with a helmet and bulletproof vest, saying that drones today \"are the new bullets on the battlefield.\"\n\nArbel itself doesn't necessarily know what it's shooting at. Semion said it's up to the soldier to engage targets responsibly.\n\nEarly versions of Arbel have been on the market for a few years now, but only recently — after Russia launched its full-scale invasion and drone usage exploded on the battlefield — has the system been viewed as a viable anti-drone solution.\n\nEuropean nations, in particular, are acutely aware of the rising drone threat, and there is increasing demand for counter-drone solutions.\n\nArbel is one of several systems that offers to help soldiers use small arms to battle the drone threat without needing to pack on too much extra gear.\n\nLast year, Business Insider observed US soldiers training to shoot down drones with the Smart Shooter — a rifle equipped with a special optic that tracks the threat, calculates its trajectory, and notifies the user when they have a reasonable chance of hitting it.\n\nAnd this year, Business Insider observed AimLock target recognition technology at a special operations event, where the company's CEO talked about how this tech could support the counter-drone fight by enhancing various weapons.\n\nBeyond rifle attachments and fresh pitches for shotguns as drone defense, Western countries are also racing to develop interceptor drones as an anti-drone capability, following Ukraine, which has invested heavily in the production of these small systems and uses them widely to take down Russian threats.",

    "title": "Forrest Gander’s Desert Phenomenology",
    "description": "Bailey...",
    "fullText": "His poems bridge the gap between nature’s wild expanse and the private space of one’s imagination.\n\nForrest Gander is on good terms with the mineral world, and he’s made a habit in his poetry of displaying a deep familiarity with the layers of sediment below our feet. His expertise—Gander is a geologist by training—has allowed him to convert technical terms (such as rift zone, ilmenite, and olivine) into lyrical tools that capture rarefied emotional states and complex systems of relation. So it’s natural that his latest collection, Mojave Ghost, opens with an act of geophagy. “The first dirt I tasted was a fistful of siltstone dust outside the house where I was born in the Mojave Desert,” Gander writes in a brief preface. The dirt, the rocks, the minerals that make up the earth around him are an index of intimacy, of a time and place that shaped his fluid sensibility. Melding the human and nonhuman realms becomes an act of self-recognition for Gander, granting a deeper understanding of himself and the setting of his birth.\n\nBut Mojave Ghost is an elegy, too, and the grief Gander expresses here is another form of intimacy we might develop with the earth. His mother, who passed away in 2020, is the titular ghost:\n\nBack here, he imagines her\neverywhere he looks. As the spring hills boing green.\n\nFlayed by the paper cut of her scent in his memory.\n\nFor her, it was home. This town\nwhere various stirps of Christian\nfundamentalism intersect\nwith unchecked retail sprawl.\n\nThe landscape of home isn’t necessarily charmed, then. Often, as Mojave Ghost investigates grief, the way it is inscribed in one’s soul but also in one’s surroundings, it assumes the form of a map of sorrow. “From the rain-blurred window of the notions shop / where you liked to go, a kneeling Elamite bull-god, / carved from alabaster, holds out a ritual vessel / to the torrential oncoming, a world forever in motion. // He must have watched you too pass by.” The observation is lovely in its obliquity, the embeddedness and particularity of its central supposition, which is really little more than a whim: You, too, must have passed by this place, must have seen and been seen. Throughout Mojave Ghost, Gander manages a delicate balancing act, bridging a gap between the wideness of the natural world and the smaller, personal space of memoiristic verse.\n\nOver the course of nearly four decades and 13 collections, Gander has evolved a poetics defined, first and foremost, by its thematic and formal hybridity: It’s a poetry of transfusion, obsessed with the crossing of borders between mediums, between the animate and inanimate. A proponent and sometimes practitioner of ecopoetry, Gander is committed to describing the natural world while simultaneously frustrating an anthropocentric reading of it. As he writes in Redstart: An Ecological Poetics (2012), a truly ecological poetry would be one that “display[s] or [is] invested with values that acknowledge the economy of interrelationship between human and nonhuman realms.”\n\nOn a thematic level, it’s easy to envision how this could be done—decenter the speaker, tone down any hymning to the splendors of the natural world—but on a formal level, it raises more interesting questions. How to evoke the being of an insect? How to limn the weave of life on a forest floor? How to sing the alterity of moss growing on a stone? Gander has conducted a series of verse experiments in recent collections—including 2021’s Twice Alive, in which he splays his lines across the page, forcing them into new relations that aim at a nonlinear reading—to capture something of the synchronicity and interconnectedness of experience we tend to associate with mushrooms and other rhizomatic life-forms. \n\nIn matters of form, Mojave Ghost is less radical in comparison, but it still feels well-suited to its particular task: mounting a diffuse vigil, mourning in a weightless way. A long, continuous poem in blank verse and with no set stanza structure, Mojave Ghost moves at a meditative crawl. Its quivering rhythms mimic those of a slow desert wind, picking up dust, chaff, and the bones of small mammals—a sort of primordial accumulation:\n\nIn molecular sand at the base of the cliff,\npale fossils appear after the rain, mostly\nammonites and bryozoa. Speaking to me.\n\nWhich is when the raft of dabbling wigeons explodes.\n\nWalking sections of the San Andreas Fault after a series of personal tragedies allowed Gander to think critically about “the fractures and folds that underlie not only my country,” as he writes in the book’s preface, “but any self in its relationship with others.” The desert, naturally, can be read as a poem, but one that is constantly being rewritten. “And though / the rocks buzz / with energy, pulsating in tune // with the earth’s vibrations, their drone // is beyond what we hear. So / the ground truth is a constant / revision,” Gander writes. “Who can read / across the vertiginous stanza / breaks?” \n\nWhat we might call the linguistic meaning of the natural world will always be beyond us. When we seek to grasp it, Gander suggests, we miss out on the natural world’s symbolic meaning—how its relation to the human self is one of constant revision.\n\nGander’s wife, the poet C.D. Wright, passed away suddenly in 2016, and his 2018 collection Be With is largely an oblique cycle of elegies for her. As Gander sees it, grief is an embedded thing. “Your impact marks / throng the resin / of my mind,” one of the final poems in Be With asserts. Gander is interested in exploring grief as a mode of relating to the world, one that might heighten rather than deaden experience. Grieving, managed the right way, is a form of observance and, as a consequence, is contiguous with love and the reverencing of those we’ve lost.\n\nMourning is only half the story of Mojave Ghost, and of Gander’s recent works. The book is also a celebration—more specifically, an epithalamium. Gander is now married to the artist Ashwini Bhat, and a good portion of Mojave Ghost is addressed to her. To the extent that the book dwells on this new romance, it is also a story of regeneration, a reawakening of the senses:\n\nLike the magnet beneath a glass table of iron shavings, you orient me.\n\nYour warm, conductive flesh. Your scent\npooling into the hollows above your clavicles\n\nIt was your imperative that launched me forward. After I had stopped.\nAfter the currents of possibility\ncoursing through my arteries were choked off\nwith windrows of memory, doubt, and reassessment.\n\nArm in arm, coming down the stepwell.\n\nI, the revenant, the forgotten unapostle of adoration.\n\nWe aren’t accustomed to thinking of dryness and sensuality as companionate phenomena, but in Gander’s poetry they’re wedded fluidly; it feels nearly alchemical, for instance, the way he imbues those iron shavings—brittle, sharp—with tender mobility, a certain desultory edge. The desert is expressively empty; on a walking tour with Bhat, Gander writes, “We pass miles of nothing but desert grass / dotted with palmilla. Heat shimmer.” And yet there’s something about the arid vacancy of the terrain that allows for transcendence. In the Mojave, “whatever he is / debouches from its sluice,” the fluid self moving outward along a natural gradient. “What / is more sacred than the gratuitous / opulence of this emptiness?” It’s a cockeyed sublimity—an oceanic feeling sans ocean, revelation without weight. \n\nThe very purpose of this method is to slip the bonds of human subjectivity and merge with the different modes of being that abound in the natural world. The emphasis is placed instead on recognizing the vital force beyond the shapes: “Isn’t the / materiality of this Joshua tree, its living / presence, more than what it means?” the book asks. The poetry wants to tear away the veil that habit has drawn over the natural world. And yet, having done this, it urges us to pull back and abide, to resist the urge to apply a fresh coat of meaning to what we’ve experienced.\n\nGander is probably American poetry’s foremost living exponent of what Helen Vendler, in an essay on the poet A.R. Ammons, called “the metaphysics of multiple connection.” In the past he’s written of his admiration for the “phenomenological poetics” of George Oppen. “Instead of the traditional Western account of a consciousness that digests the external world,” Gander observes in his essay collection A Faithful Existence (2005), “Oppen honors a consciousness interwoven with the world of objects, a consciousness that is nothing if not a collaboration with the world.” If there is a central lesson in Gander’s poetry, it might be precisely this: that consciousness, identity, and being itself are collaborations. \n\nOver the past decade or so, he’s returned again and again to the image of lichen, an emblem of fusion and an allegory, of sorts, for the combinatory nature of identity as it reveals itself in the act and experience of intimacy. “With lichen,” as he points out in the prefatory note to Twice Alive, “the original organisms are utterly changed in their compact. They can’t return to what they were.” In Knot (2022), the speaker of one poem echoes this observation. “Like the component species of a lichen, I gave something up to become something else,” we read. “And I am impenetrable, inviolable, without the dimension necessary for anything to breach me.”\n\nLichen occurs twice in Mojave Ghost, first as plain description—an orange blotch on the “broken-tile roof” of a church—and later in an evocation of Bhat’s voice, which sounds to Gander “as low and sure / and fragile as lichens.” These are subtle references, and in general Mojave Ghost is a whispery book, spare as its two namesakes. Images rarely recur, save for a small refrain: “What bird wove those sprigs of lavender, mint, yarrow, / and citronella into a nest below our rusted porch light?” It’s a fitting moment of fusion and entanglement. Though composite, these plants have made a new whole—a nest and a home. We are back in the realm of the human, of a warmth that is often playful. Nature is “an endless memoir of / ravelment,” as Gander writes in Twice Alive. Marriage, which he calls “a divination of resonant relations” in Mojave Ghost, could just as well be added to this list.",

    "fullText": "A powerful solar eruption is expected to hit Earth soon, according to a forecast from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center.\n\nA coronal mass ejection -- a massive burst of solar material and magnetic field from the sun's outer atmosphere -- is expected to arrive at Earth early to midday Tuesday, according to NOAA. The CME, linked to an M8.1 solar flare, could cause elevated geomagnetic activity and potentially a G3 storm, the third level on the Space Weather Scale.\n\nA geomagnetic storm of this magnitude is considered \"strong\" and has the potential to cause some minor impacts to technology, such as satellite disruptions and radio communication issues.\n\nSolar activity could also cause stronger-than-usual auroras, making the northern lights visible in more U.S. regions than usual, including many northern states and some states from the lower Midwest to Oregon, according to NOAA.\n\nNorthern Lights display expected for 2nd night in a row for these US states\n\nWeather is commonly thought of as the conditions outside, from rain and snow to sunny skies. But beyond Earth's atmosphere, there's another kind of weather that can be just as impactful.\n\nSpace weather is primarily influenced by the sun, which generates energy through nuclear fusion. It refers to the conditions in the space environment and how these conditions impact objects throughout our solar system, including Earth and the thousands of satellites that orbit it, according to NASA.\n\nThe Sun constantly emits high-energy charged particles, plasma eruptions and bursts of radiation that can disrupt the space conditions when they reach Earth. Fortunately, our planet's magnetic field and atmosphere shield us from the most hazardous effects. But it doesn't stop everything.\n\nOne of the most well-known interactions of solar wind colliding with Earth's magnetosphere and thin, high atmosphere comes in the form of auroras, which produce the beautiful northern lights.\n\nHowever, many impacts of solar activity can be harmful, affecting a wide range of technologies from communication systems to GPS to power grids, according to NOAA.\n\nNorthern lights on display across the eastern US amid 'severe' solar storm\n\nWhy you should care about space weather\n\nThe sun has been busy lately. In October 2024, the sun's magnetic field reached the solar maximum in its 11-year cycle, during which time the number of solar flares is at its highest. But activity has continued even as the cycle continues, bringing several geomagnetic storms and aurora displays to Earth.\n\nIn late November, Airbus announced that solar storms could \"corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls\" and quickly rolled out a software fix to address the issue. In November, intense solar flares created brilliant auroras across the world, including parts of the U.S. as far south as Florida. And December began with NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center issuing a geomagnetic storm watch.\n\nNASA to launch 2 new satellites that will help forecast solar storms\n\nHow is space weather monitored and measured?\n\nBoth NASA and NOAA monitor space weather. NOAA's Space Weather Prediction Center, however, is specifically focused on monitoring and predicting events in the space environment that can affect technology and life on Earth.\n\nThe Space Weather Prediction Center tracks a variety of space weather events, including geomagnetic storms, solar radiation storms, solar flares and sunspots.\n\nThe agency uses NOAA Space Weather Scales to communicate current and forecasted space weather conditions for three of the most impactful events: geomagnetic storms, solar radiation storms and radio blackouts -- quantifying their potential effect on people and infrastructure.\n\nTo communicate the severity of these events, the NOAA Space Weather Scales use numbered levels (1-5), similar to how earthquakes, hurricanes and tornadoes are measured. Each level outlines the potential impacts, measures the intensity of the phenomenon and estimates how often such events occur.\n\nHow to increase your chances of seeing the northern lights as the current solar cycle peaks\n\nWhat are the impacts of geomagnetic storms?\n\nGeomagnetic storms often attract the most attention because of their potential to disrupt communication systems, GPS and power grids.\n\nSignificant geomagnetic storms are often caused by a Coronal Mass Ejection from the sun, a massive burst of charged particles embedded in a magnetic field that interacts with Earth's magnetic field, temporarily disturbing it and releasing large amounts of energy, according to NOAA.\n\nGeomagnetic storm intensity is ranked on the G-scale for both current and forecasted conditions, with G1 storms considered \"minor\" and G5 storms considered \"extreme.”\n\nThe G-scale measures geomagnetic storms based on the planetary K-index, known as Kp, which ranges from zero to nine. This index is calculated by observing fluctuations in Earth's magnetic field. G1 and G2 level storms are quite common and occur frequently throughout the year. In contrast, G5 storms are extremely rare and have the most significant impacts.\n\nNotable technology disruptions and widespread auroras typically occur when a geomagnetic storm reaches G3 (strong), becoming more significant at G4 (severe). G3 and G4 storms are not rare, with several occurring each year depending on the solar cycle.\n\nThe Space Weather Prediction Center will issue geomagnetic storm watches and warnings when the latest forecasts indicate that geomagnetic storms are likely or imminent, providing information on expected intensity, timing and potential impacts. The agency also issues guidance on where an aurora may be visible during an ongoing event.\n\nNorthern lights fill the sky: Slideshow\n\nThe strongest geomagnetic storm in over two decades arrived in May 2024. The G5 storm brought a remarkable display of the aurora borealis (northern lights), visible from many areas worldwide, including locations where aurora sightings are uncommon, according to NASA.\n\nThe incident also caused several issues on the ground, including tripping high-voltage lines, overheating transformers, and GPS-guided tractors veering off course, which disrupted planting plans in the Midwest U.S. Additionally, several trans-Atlantic flights were forced to change course due to concerns about potential communication and navigation failures.\n\nOne of the most significant solar activity outbreaks in recent history occurred in late October 2003, when a series of massive solar storms hit Earth. The global effects were wide-ranging, impacting power grids, airline flights and spacecraft operations, according to NOAA. These extreme and prolonged geomagnetic storms, some reaching G5 intensity, brought widespread aurora sightings on Oct. 29 and 30, visible as far south as Texas and Florida.\n\nAs recently as early Monday morning, a powerful solar flare, classified as an R3 (strong) radio‑blackout event by NOAA, impacted Australia and parts of Southeast Asia. This intense flare caused a major radio blackout on the sunlit side of Earth. The R3 rating indicates a wide-area loss of high-frequency radio communications, lasting roughly an hour. Events like this can disrupt satellite operations, degrade GPS signals and interfere with radio communications used by aviation, maritime operations, and other critical services.\n\nABC News' Julia Jacobo contributed to this report.",

But in reality, many still operate like 20th-century factories: hierarchical, risk-averse, and slow. Jana Werner, executive in residence of enterprise strategy at Amazon Web Services, argues that organizations should instead think of an octopus: an organism that manages complexity, can work in many different modes with some autonomy, but all moving in concert toward a common goal. Werner says the future belongs to companies that distribute decision-making, empower teams at the edge, and treat innovation as everyone’s job, and explains steps you can take as a leader to make this cultural shift.

    "fullText": "STARKE, Fla. (AP) — A man convicted of stabbing a woman to death during a home invasion robbery more than 30 years ago is scheduled to be executed Tuesday evening in Florida.\n\nMark Allen Geralds, 58, is set to receive a lethal injection starting at 6 p.m. at Florida State Prison near Starke. Geralds was convicted of murder, armed robbery, burglary and stealing a car and was sentenced to death in 1990. The Florida Supreme Court later vacated the sentence but affirmed the conviction, and Geralds was resentenced to death in 1992.\n\nIt would be Florida's 18th death sentence carried out in 2025, further extending the state record for total executions in a single year.\n\nAccording to court records, Tressa Pettibone’s 8-year-old son found his mother beaten and stabbed to death on the kitchen floor of their Panama City home in February 1989. Geralds was a carpenter who had previously done remodeling work at the home.\n\nGeralds ran into Pettibone and her children at a shopping mall about a week before the killing, and Pettibone mentioned that her husband was away on business. Geralds later approached Pettibone's son at the video arcade and asked when the boy's father would return and what time he and his sister left for and returned from school each day, according to court records.\n\nInvestigators found that Geralds pawned jewelry with traces of Pettibone’s blood on it, and plastic ties used to bind Pettibone matched ties found in Geralds’ car.\n\nAfter a death warrant was signed last month and his execution date set, Geralds told a judge he did not wish to pursue any further appeals. The judge signed off on that decision.\n\nA total of 44 men have died by court-ordered execution so far this year in the U.S., and a handful of executions are scheduled for the rest of the year.\n\nSince the U.S. Supreme Court restored the death penalty in 1976, the highest previous annual total of Florida executions was eight in 2014. Florida has executed more people than any other state this year. Another execution is planned for next week in the state under death warrants signed by Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis.\n\nFrank Athen Walls, 58, is scheduled for Florida’s 19th execution this year on Dec. 18. He was convicted of fatally shooting a man and woman during a home invasion robbery and later confessing to three other killings.\n\nFlorida's lethal injections are carried out with a sedative, a paralytic and a drug that stops the heart, according to the state Department of Corrections.",

    "description": "Merck and Duke Energy stand out as rare “safe yield” plays, pairing 3%+ dividends with solid earnings growth, reasonable payout ratios, and durable demand drivers in healthcare and regulated utilities.",
    "fullText": "The Fed just reminded everyone that the path to lower rates won't be a straight line. In late October, policymakers delivered a second cut this year. The benchmark rate was trimmed by 0.25 points to about 3.9%. They aimed to support growth and hiring even though inflation remains above the 2% goal.\n\nShortly after, two Fed officials publicly pushed back against another December reduction. They argue that future moves will depend heavily on incoming data rather than any preset easing script. Markets took the hint quickly as the dollar has bounced, and gold has slumped.\n\nOur exclusive Barchart Brief newsletter is your FREE midday guide to what's moving stocks, sectors, and investor sentiment - delivered right when you need the info most. \n\nThat same repricing has pushed investors to focus more on dependable cash flow and balance sheet strength. The search for quality income is undoubtedly why Triumvirate recently highlighted Merck (MRK) and Duke Energy (DUK) as two of the top high-yield stocks to own right now.\n\nSo in a market full of high-yield landmines, what exactly sets Merck and Duke Energy apart as two of the safest dividend stocks income investors can buy right now? Let’s find out.\n\nMerck & Co., with roughly $252.7B in market capitalization, develops human and animal health therapies spanning oncology, vaccines, infectious diseases, and cardiometabolic care. Its dividend profile fits neatly with the “safe high-yield” thesis, with a forward annual dividend of $3.24 per share and a forward yield of 3.09%, plus a next ex-dividend date scheduled for 12/15/25 and a payout ratio of 37.38%.\n\nMRK sits at $102.81 as of Dec. 3, up 3.2% year-to-date (YTD) and 0.82% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nIts valuation picture shows investors paying 12.12x trailing earnings and 0.96x on a PEG basis versus sector medians of 17.87x and 1.86x, signaling a discount multiple for a business still producing solid growth.​\n\nIts dividend looks even sturdier when set against the earnings engine. This latest quarterly report, released for the period ending 09/25, showed total worldwide sales of $17.3B, up 4% year-over-year (YoY), or 3% excluding currency effects. It highlighted KEYTRUDA as the main driver, with sales of $8.1B, climbing 10% reported and 8% on a constant-currency basis. This also broke out WINREVAIR revenue at $360M, up 141%, and CAPVAXIVE sales of $244M, underscoring depth beyond the flagship oncology franchise.\n\nIt noted that GARDASIL/GARDASIL 9 slipped to $1.7B, down 24%, or 25% excluding FX, while Animal Health grew 9% to $1.6B, or 7% in constant currency. This translated into GAAP EPS of $2.32 and non‑GAAP EPS of $2.58, with both figures including a $0.10 per‑share charge tied to a milestone payment to LaNova. It also beat the quarter’s $2.36 consensus by $0.22, a 9.32% upside surprise.​",

    "title": "Use the Pareto Principle to Prioritize Your To-Do List",
    "description": "This method can reveal often you \"work\" without actually getting anything out of it.",
    "fullText": "It’s likely you’ve heard of the Pareto principle (maybe even while reading my tips on how to be more productive at work or study more effectively). But do you really know what the Pareto principle is?\n\nTo be honest, I only just started to get a grip on it fairly recently, because it's a lot easier to read about than put into practice. Also known as the 80/20 rule or the law of the vital few, it can be little confusing at first, but understanding and implementing it can truly transformative, helping you to better manage your time and get more done with less effort. Who doesn't want that?\n\nBasically, the Pareto principle states that 80% of your outcomes result from just 20% of your effort. The principle was coined by consultant Joseph M. Juran in the 1940s and he named it after a sociologist and economist named Vilfredo Pareto, who was famous for pointing out that 80% of the land in Italy was owned by 20% of the total amount of people. You’ll hear it described a number of ways: 80% of results come from 20% of the work, or 80% of effects come from 20% of the causes. No matter the wording, it all means the same thing; just focus on that 80/20 split.\n\nAn often-cited example of how this works for everyday people is learning the piano or guitar. You study individual notes, keys, time signatures, tempos, chords, rhythms, styles and so much else, including music theory. But when it’s time to jam, you’re probably falling back on a handful of the most common chords—and it sounds fine. In that way, a huge chunk of your actual playing is dependent on just a few small things you've mastered (although you do need that knowledge of keys and styles to make it come together).\n\nFor another example, consider how a few truly excellent players tend to be responsible for the majority of points scored by your favorite sports team during a given game. Now think of how much you do in a day: You go to your job, work any side gigs you might have, do household chores, and devote time to hobbies, child-rearing, studying for classes, going to the gym, and seeing friends. You do a lot, but you only get paid for a small fraction of that work, which is why you might prioritize your job over some of the other things on the list—even side hustles, which typically generate less money. That's where the 80/20 rule comes in: It helps you prioritize your to-do list.\n\nYou can identify ways the general principle manifests in your work. For instance, if you work for a retail company, you might notice a major chunk of profits comes from a small but dedicated group of consistent buyers. It would make sense, then, to focus a majority of your work on appealing to them, or to bringing others into that group—maybe by strategic, data-based advertising. If the majority of would-be consumers ignore your email marketing, don't keep doing what you're doing. Instead, zero in on how you can add more people to that core group, or just go all-in on the core group itself. The real trick to using this principle is figuring out how it applies to your own day-to-day tasks.\n\nWhen you make your daily to-do list, use a prioritization technique, like the 1-3-5 list, Kanban, or Eisenhower Matrix. Right off the bat, this helps you figure out which of your necessary tasks for the day are important and which can be pushed off or delegated. Spend about two weeks working on your to-do lists every day as normal, but at the end of the day, write down what the direct results of each activity were. So, if you spent half an hour responding to emails and netted 10 new clients from that, write it down. If you dedicated an hour to compiling the data for a big meeting that got your project greenlit, mark it down. Over time, the basic functions that yield the biggest results will become apparent and you can start making those activities—the 20%-of-your-effort activities—a bigger priority, so you waste less time on the tasks that don’t produce as many results.\n\nWorking backward and considering the effects, then identifying their causes, will help you prioritize and get more done, but it can also help you with non-work tasks. In a more abstract sense, a relatively small amount of effort is required to grab a coffee with a friend or help your kid with homework, but the 80% yield might be reenforcing and maintaining a friendship or helping your child feel safe and accomplished, which have longer-lasting impacts than the 30 minutes those tasks take. When you free up your working time through prioritization and an understanding of the Pareto principle, you have more opportunities to spread it around in other areas of your life and keep reaping the benefits.",

    "fullText": "WASHINGTON, Dec 9 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump's approval rating edged up to 41% in the past week as Republicans warmed to his handling of the cost of ​living, a sign the administration's new focus on affordability might be supporting his popularity, ‌according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nThe six-day poll, which closed on Monday, showed approval of the president rising from 38% late ‌last month, which was the lowest since Trump returned to the White House in January. Trump started his second term with a 47% rating.\n\nRepublicans performed poorly in a handful of state elections in November as Democrats hammered the Trump administration over persistently high inflation. But in recent weeks Trump has engaged more forcefully ⁠on the topic, scaling back some ‌of his tariff increases and pledging to combat high food prices.\n\nTrump has gone so far as to describe Democrats' focus on the issue as \"a hoax.\" He ‍is scheduled to give a speech on affordability and other economic issues on Tuesday in Pennsylvania, a battleground state in national elections. Several congressional races in Pennsylvania will be competitive next year when all 435 seats in the U.S. House of ​Representatives are at stake.\n\nTrump's performance on the cost of living, where he got a 31% approval ‌rating, is among his weakest popularity scores. But that was up from 26% in late November.\n\nA 10-percentage-point gain among Republicans boosted his number, and 69% of Republicans rated him favorably on the issue. Some 85% of Republicans approved of his overall performance as president, up from 82% last month.\n\nU.S. inflation rates surged under Trump's predecessor in office, Democrat Joe Biden, and the economic pain helped Trump defeat Kamala ⁠Harris, Biden's vice president, in the 2024 presidential election. ​Inflation has remained elevated under Trump, with prices up 3% ​in the 12 months through September, above the historical norm of around 2%.\n\nThe uptick in Trump's popularity also owed to a modest increase in his approval among Hispanics, ‍a group that swung ⁠in Trump's direction in last year's election. Some 34% of Hispanics in the latest Reuters/Ipsos poll said they approved of Trump's performance in the White House, up from 32% in late ⁠November.\n\nThe latest survey gathered responses from 4,434 U.S. adults nationwide and was conducted online. It had a margin of error, ‌a measure of precision, of 2 percentage points in either direction.",

    "title": "The 20 Most Essential Podcasts of 2025 (and Two Episodes You Can't Miss)",
    "description": "Feed your listening queue with the year's best shows.",
    "fullText": "If 2024 was the year podcasts scrambled to find their footing after the massive wave of acquisitions and consolidation during the pandemic, 2025 is the year the medium truly hit its stride (and I should know...I not only write a podcast newsletter and run a podcast company, I also listen to literally thousands of hours of podcasts every year).\n\nWhatever kind of show you're seeking—from a scripted story about demon possession, to a deeply reported investigation into outlaws at sea, to a brilliantly improvised comedy series—my guide to the best podcasts of 2025 has you covered. I've divided the list into categories to help you find exactly what you’re in the mood for—and because some episodes are just too good to get buried in your queue, I’ve also highlighted two standout episodes of past favorite shows that you shouldn’t miss. Let’s get listening.\n\nThis year, Lauren Shippen, the master of audio fiction and creator of The Bright Sessions, brought us Two Thousand and Late, a scripted fiction show about a woman who, on her 36th birthday, gets possessed by a demon who was supposed to visit her when she turned 16. This is a clever, tightly written, expertly produced, and endlessly fun adventure that blends corporate satire with time-travel chaos.\n\nThe new audio drama from Gabriel Urbina (best known as the creator and head writer of Wolf 359), The Harbingers introduces us to two different-in-every-way grad students who eventually become the first people with genuine magical powers, making them the most powerful people in the world. This sweeping, sound-rich show is smart, unpredictable, and gripping from minute one.\n\nI love a podcast with good segments, so of course I’m going to be drawn to a podcast that is only segments. Next We Have, hosted by Gareth Reynolds (of The Dollop and We’re Here to Help), brings on the best improvisers to create segments that can be completely ridiculous because the point isn’t to make them sustainable, but to see how far a bunch of comedians can stretch the medium. (Segment examples: penning a negative Yelp review for a chain hotel on behalf of a listener, calling Gareth’s childhood friend to see if he remembers a gross sleepover incident from their past, etc.)\n\nIf you have been listening to podcasts long enough to remember Call Your Girlfriend, you will appreciate the tried but true format of eavesdropping on a best friend catch-up. Text Me Back co-hosts Lindy West and Meagan Hatcher-Mays have been besties since middle school, and listening to them brings back the flavor of that beloved show. While Call Your Girlfriend leaned heavily into everyday chatter, Text Me Back feels like non-stop standup. Lindy is an author and TV writer and Meagan is a democracy policy expert, but together they are an unstoppable comedy duo. They can spin mundane moments, like ordering salad for takeout, into listening gold. This is the perfect show to binge when you need a laugh (and some validation for your own awkward moments).\n\nIf you knew that aliens were going to take over the world in 50 years, would you be worried? The Last Invention argues that this is our reality, if you replace “aliens” with “AI.” The AI revolution, host Gregory Warner says, is already here, and The Last Invention begins with the history of machine learning and provides a thoughtful exploration of how it is being used now, before looking into the future to see what's coming, what we could gain, what we could lose, and how best to prepare ourselves. It’s fact-based rather than fear-mongering, yet it might be the most unsettling thing I listened to all year.\n\nJoel and Ian Gold are brothers (Joel’s a psychiatrist; Ian’s a philosopher) and co-authors of the book Suspicious Minds: How Culture Shapes Madness, which they've spun into this show (co-hosted with Sean O’Grady). It's a documentary series that tackles issues around AI-fueled delusions, and aims to understand where they fit into humanity’s history of delusional thinking in general. Using real patients’ riveting stories, it plunges listeners deep into their disturbed mental states, then follows their journeys toward managing the illness. We've read the headlines—the person who was gaslit by ChatGPT into thinking he was digital Jesus, or the man who was convinced he was a piece of software—but we don’t always get the context. Sean interviews these people with empathy to get that crucial context—and finds a troubling universality to their stories.\n\nDiabolical Lies is a culture and politics podcast hosted by Katie Gatti Tassin and Caro Claire Burke. Think of it as a deep dive into the ideas shaping modern America, from algorithmic media, to late-stage capitalism, to identity politics. But it's really funny. And skeptical. And backed by tons and tons of research. Because it’s listener-supported and free from corporate pressures, the hosts have the freedom to question mainstream narratives. (Every dollar earned is split between Caro, Katie, and organizations that support mutual aid in Gaza, legal representation to immigrant kids ensnared in the legal system, and other worthy causes.)​​\n\nPablo Torre is a veteran journalist and former ESPN commentator turned podcast powerhouse, and he now hosts Pablo Torre Finds Out, which uses sports as a lens through which to examine issues of culture and power. Blending investigative journalism, commentary, and personal curiosity, he goes beyond the surface to find the deeper meaning behind the headlines. His delve into a major scandal involving LA Clippers owner Steve Ballmer was named one of Apple Podcast’s best podcasts episodes of the year, and that's just one of dozens of compelling stories you'll explore.\n\nIn earlier seasons, In The Dark has won awards, gotten a man released from jail, and uncovered a horrifying military conspiracy. The latest season, Blood Relatives, explores one of Britain's most notorious family massacres, revealing huge problems in the prosecution’s case against Jeremy Bamber, who is currently siting in prison for killing his parents, sister, and nephews back in 1985. Host Heidi Blake has access to sprawling case files and has talked to seemingly everyone even tangentially related to the case. What she found is astonishing, and infuriating.\n\nSeason one of  The Outlaw Ocean, which exposed true crimes committed at sea, was some of the most dangerous audio I have ever heard. Yet in the first episode of season two, Pulitzer-prize winning journalist and host Ian Urbina says that this season includes the most dangerous investigative reporting of his career. There’s a three-part series about seafaring migrants getting thrown in secret prisons (his team got jailed for reporting on that one), an exclusive profile on a guy who is either a pirate or a nautical James Bond, an expose on a massive Indian shrimp-processing plant, and an unprecedented deep dive into China’s secretive fishing practices. This is real investigative journalism, beautifully beautifully packaged but no less dangerous for it.\n\nBeth’s Dead isn’t a murder investigation show. It’s a story about what happens when parasocial relationships go dangerously wrong. It all began when Monica Padman (of Armchair Expert) started looking into why her favorite podcast, hosted by Elizabeth Laime and Andy Rosen, ended years ago. For Beth’s Dead, she gets on mic with Elizabeth and Andy to explore a chilling story involving obsessive listeners, manipulation, and what happens when one super fan turns into something much darker.\n\nYou don’t often see stand-up comedy blended with true crime, but that's what you get with Wisecrack. The story centers on comedian Edd Hedges, who returns to his hometown for a charity comedy gig. That night, someone he went to school with murders his family, and Edd has reason to believe that this guy almost tried to murder Edd, too. Or did he? Hosted by ​​TV crime producer Jodi Tovay, Wisecrack is about memory and trauma more than it is about a specific crime. If you liked Netflix’s Baby Reindeer, this expertly produced, genre-bending psychological puzzle is for you.\n\nAmy Poehler’s Good Hang is the best hang and one of the best celebrity-hosted podcasts ever. Poehler brings on superstar comedians to talk about what makes them laugh, share stories from their lives and careers, and just generally shoot the breeze. Conversations with people like Kristin Wiig, Idris Elba, and Ina Garten swing from gut-bustingly hilarious to raw and vulnerable, offering us an inside look into the entertainment industry. The production is as casual as the vibe: Amy leaves in “mistakes” that a different show might edit out, like a guest jumping into the zoom late, or what feels like minutes of laughter, and the result is a comfort-listen that will leave you feeling like you've just been hugged.\n\nStrangers on a Bench isn’t your typical interview podcast. Musician/host Tom Rosenthal goes around parks, approaches random strangers on benches, and asks to sit down with them for completely open-ended conversations that feel like meditations. The strangers are always anonymous—we don’t get names or occupations or any other specifics. This means the strangers can get real, and they do. You never know what will happen when you hit play. Some episodes are light, ordinary “slice-of-life” chats, while others dive into issues of grief, trauma, loss, longing, mental-health struggles, or life transitions.\n\nStop Rewind: The Lost Boy tells a true story so unbelievable I literally did not believe it—at first I assumed it was fictional. It’s the story of Taj, a child who was born in India and adopted by a family in the U.S. He had an abusive childhood, was raised in complete poverty, and had only hazy memories of that time—including some that suggested he was brought to America via a kidnapping. He spent his life trying to forget this, purposely or not, and carve his own path, until the day he found an old cassette tape filled with recordings of himself as a child that his mom recorded when he first arrived in the country, knowing he would eventually forget his native language. As an adult, long after he stopped being able to understand what his own voice was saying, Taj met someone who spoke the language, and the transcription of those tapes revealed what really happened to him. The results is a jaw-dropping story especially perfect for a podcast: it's “told through rare original recordings, immersive sound design and unforgettable first-person testimony.” You’re already dying to hear the tape, right?\n\nZach Mack’s Alternate Realities series, located on the Embedded feed, starts off with a bet between Zach and his dad, who each believed the other had been lost to conspiracy theories. Zach’s father had started to believe in chemtrails, that the government controls the weather, that ANTIFA staged January 6, that a cabal called the globalists is controlling the world. Zach…did not believe those things. So in early 2024 Zach’s dad made a list of 10 prophesies (such as: a bunch of democrats would be convicted of treason and/or murder, the U.S. would come under marshal law) that he was 100% sure would happen, and by Jan. 1, 2025, Zach would have to give his father $1,000 for every one that did. For every one that didn’t, Zach would get the $1,000. What starts as a strange bet develops in a beautifully depicted family tragedy that forces you to consider the depths of your own mortality.\n\nKate Downey has been having debilitating period pain every month since she was 14 years old. The affliction is common, yet something nobody seems to want to talk about or research—and certainly nobody is trying to have fun with it. But Kate is doing all of the above with Cramped, which is somehow boisterous and dead serious at the same time. It's full of fascinating interviews, illuminating info, and helpful tips for anyone with a uterus. She gets smart, funny people on the mic to talk about their that-time-of-the-month experiences, what is really going on in their bodies and why nobody cares, and why Kate hasn’t been able to get answers from a doctor after 20 years of asking questions.\n\nWhen I heard the first episode of Debt Heads I felt like a thirsty person who had just discovered water in the desert—I don’t like talking about money, yet this show has a lot of things I didn't know I’ve been craving. Jamie Feldman and Rachel Webster approach money matters from an angle we’re not used to hearing. They joke that it’s a “true crime investigation into the murder of our bank accounts,” and the show is made with the care of one as it considers the deeply human factors that can drive people into debt.\n\nClotheshorse’s Amanda Lee McCarty spent years working in retail and fashion as a buyer for huge brands like Urban Outfitters, before a quasi-spokesperson for debunking the glamour that obscures the real truths about the clothing we buy. Amanda’s multi-part series “I’m With the Brand” helps us begin to untangle our relationship with brands, built on both extensive research and her personal experience. You explore the history of brands, with shout-outs to several that are now just licensed zombie versions of themselves; an exposé of cause marketing; and a breakdown of the ten commandments of emotional branding, paired with specific stories about how they’ve been applied. (Careful, once you see them you cannot unsee them.) Repeat after Amanda: Brands are not your friends.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal's “Camp Swamp Road” is about a story that started as a road rage incident and ended up being either a stand your ground case, or a murder, depending who you ask. In 2023 on Camp Swamp Road in South Carolina, Weldon Boyd and Bradley Williams killed Scott Spivey, who they said was driving erratically and shooting his gun out his car window. Scott Spivey’s sister, who is for some reason going through all the audio of the incident, as well as audio of Weldon Boyd interacting with his family, friends, cop buddies, feels differently. The reporting here tries to get to the truth of the matter.\n\nAdventurer Blair Braverman is building a mini-survival podcast on the You’re Wrong About feed. (If stories about the lives of Baby Jessica, Chris McCandless, or the 1972 Uruguayan plane crash interest you, search her name in the archive.) “The Auralyn” is one of her best: Blair’s telling of the story of Maurice and Maralyn Bailey, a couple who in 1972 miraculously survived 118 days adrift on a tiny rubber liferaft in the Pacific Ocean after their yacht was destroyed. Obviously this is a story about survival, but more importantly, it's about what buoys us, and what gives us the strength to survive, whether that be on a raft adrift at sea, or just through the course of a regular bad day.\n\nOn Heavyweight, Jonathan Goldstein acts as a detective who helps people resolve issues from their past. In this episode we meet “Kevin,” who had a cinematically terrible childhood. He had two friends who kind of saved his life, or at least his sanity, during these hard years, but one day they disappeared, so Jonathan set out to find them. Are they OK? Do they even remember Kevin? This episode has all the pieces of a compelling podcast: a wonderful storyteller in Kevin, a heart-wrenching narrative, a real chance at closure, and a resolution that isn’t easy to explain.",

    "description": "\"Their numbers could easily skyrocket.\"",
    "fullText": "Startling footage of an unbelievably large, dangerous pair of invasive snakes captured in Florida recently went viral, but the most unsettling detail was hiding in the comments.\n\nYouTubers TheCritterCult (@TheCritterCult) and Antman's Adventures (@AntmansAdventures) recently teamed up for some Burmese python hunting in the Everglades.\n\nThe Critter Cult is a social media account and YouTube channel hosted by wildlife enthusiasts Kyle and Meg. The duo's content is for \"anyone who loves all things critters, all the time,\" which sometimes means eradicating invasive species to protect native wildlife.\n\nIn the viral short, Kyle hunted with Anthony of Antman's Adventures.\n\nIn a longer version of the video, Kyle and Anthony were stunned when they stumbled upon a 17-foot Burmese python — doubly so when they found a second, equally hefty snake.\n\nThey confirmed that both snakes were female, prompting a commenter to speculate about the number of eggs each could lay.\n\n\"We have not gotten the opportunity to do necropsies on these snakes, but yes, we assume that each of them have around 70 developing eggs inside them,\" @TheCritterCult replied.\n\nDespite being well-suited to the Everglades, Burmese pythons aren't native to Florida.\n\nOfficials first recorded a sighting in 1979, and according to History.com, the snakes became one of the most destructive invasive species in American history.\n\nThe outlet cited one fatality linked to Burmese pythons, but as the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) noted, the biggest threats they pose are to the ecosystem and native wildlife.\n\nDo you think humans are doing enough to protect endangered animals?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nUnfortunately, this species thrives in Florida's Everglades, outcompeting native animals for food and even snacking on predators like alligators. They've also slithered into residential areas.\n\nAccording to the USGS, a 2012 study revealed that Burmese pythons had already decimated or eradicated populations of small native mammals.\n\nResearchers determined that \"populations of raccoons had declined 99.3%, opossums 98.9%, and bobcats 87.5% since 1997,\" while \"marsh rabbits, cottontail rabbits, and foxes effectively disappeared over that time.\"\n\nThis video underscored one of their worst traits: their rapid rate of reproduction.\n\nThe University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences explained that as of 2008, the average number of eggs per clutch was 36. However, it found a python \"carrying 85 developing eggs,\" adding that the species had \"been known to lay as many as 107 eggs.\"\n\nIn January, the Naples Daily News reported that, while Florida's Burmese python population was difficult to quantify, low estimates placed it in the \"tens of thousands.\" Roughly half are believed to be female, and left unchecked, their numbers could easily skyrocket.\n\nThe Critter Cult's hosts are professional python contractors, and they're not alone.\n\nFlorida pays Burmese python catchers up to $200 per captured snake, incentivizing locals to stay aware and help reduce their numbers.\n\nIn July, National Geographic profiled fashion designers' efforts to repurpose snakeskin into sustainable and desirable python-leather accessories.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

You may disagree with Cramer's investing methodology and critique his failures, but it's undeniable that his opinions have sway.\n\nAnd when it comes to long-term dividend investing, those opinions have held up quite well. Cramer's opinionated takes often go awry since he's mostly asked about the trendiest growth stocks that are hard to assess. But when dealing with dividend stocks with a consistent track record, it's no longer hit or miss. Jim Cramer has decades of experience with the stock market, and his input is worth lending an ear to when it comes to dividend stocks.\n\nHere are two dividend stocks he likes for retirees:\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) that mostly has retail tenants. Its tenants are strong, and the company has managed to maintain a very stable and consistent portfolio over the years with little to no trouble. The occupancy rate has remained at 97% even in 2008 and continues to be high.\n\nThe consistency is such that Realty Income is called \"The Monthly Dividend Company\". It pays dividends to its shareholders every month. The yield right now is 5.61% and has declared 664 consecutive monthly dividends.\n\nCramer thinks highly of O stock, but he believes \"Realty Income is for people who are a little bit older.\"\n\nEarlier this year, a 67-year-old called Cramer and asked about two high-yield dividend stocks. But before he could even finish the question, Cramer replied. He said, \"No, no, no. If you need yield, just go by our Realty Income.\"\n\nRealty Income raises the bar to the point where it has become the go-to monthly dividend stock. For retirees, I believe it's the best one. Monthly dividends are convenient, and the yield is very high, but not unsustainable.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) started developing a reputation for being a steady Eddie that you hold for almost no gains and a small dividend yield. Given that a 2.5%-plus yield is easily available risk-free these days, JNJ stock hasn't been the most attractive despite it being a Dividend King with 63 consecutive years of dividend increases on record.",

    "title": "Scientists Announce a Physical Warp Drive Is Now Possible. Seriously.",
    "description": "For the first time, scientists have introduced a physical model for warp drive. That means humans are one step closer to traveling at faster-than-light speeds.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA research paper proposes a fully physically realized model for warp drive.\n\nThis builds on an existing model that requires negative energy—an impossibility.\n\nThe new model is exciting, but warp speed is still probably decades or centuries away.\n\nIn a surprising paper, scientists say they’ve nailed down a physical model for a warp drive, which flies in the face of what we’ve long thought about the crazy concept of warp speed travel: that it requires exotic, negative forces.\n\nTo best understand what the breakthrough means, you’ll need a quick crash course on the far-out idea of traveling through folded space.\n\nThe colloquial term “warp drive” comes from science fiction, most famously Star Trek. The faster-than-light warp drive of the Federation works by colliding matter and antimatter and converting the explosive energy to propulsion. Star Trek suggests that this extraordinary power alone pushes the ship at faster-than-light speeds.\n\nScientists have been studying and theorizing about faster-than-light space travel for decades. One major reason for our interest is pure pragmatism: without warp drive, we’re probably never making it to a neighboring star system. The closest such trip is still four years long at light speed.\n\nOur current understanding of warp speed dates back to 1994, when a now-iconic theoretical physicist named Miguel Alcubierre first proposed what we’ve called the Alcubierre drive ever since.\n\nThe Alcubierre drive conforms to Einstein’s theory of general relativity to achieve superluminal travel. “By a purely local expansion of spacetime behind the spaceship and an opposite contraction in front of it,” Alcubierre wrote in his paper’s abstract, “motion faster than the speed of light as seen by observers outside the disturbed region is possible.”\n\nEssentially, an Alcubierre drive would expend a tremendous amount of energy—likely more than what’s available within the universe—to contract and twist space-time in front of it and create a bubble. Inside that bubble would be an inertial reference frame where explorers would feel no proper acceleration. The rules of physics would still apply within the bubble, but the ship would be localized outside of space.\n\nIt might help to think of an Alcubierre drive like the classic “tablecloth and dishes” party trick: The spaceship sits atop the tablecloth of spacetime, the drive pulls the fabric around it, and the ship is situated in a new place relative to the fabric.\n\nAlcubierre describes spacetime expanding on one side of the ship and contracting on the other, thanks to that enormous amount of energy and a requisite amount of exotic matter—in this case, negative energy.\n\nSome scientists have criticized the Alcubierre drive, however, because it requires too much mass and negative energy for humans to ever seriously construct a warp-based propulsion system. NASA has been trying to build a physical warp drive through Eagleworks Laboratories for most of the last decade, but hasn’t yet made any significant strides.\n\nThis brings us to the new study, which scientists in the Advanced Propulsion Laboratory (APL) at Applied Physics just published in the peer-reviewed journal Classical and Quantum Gravity. In the report, the APL team unveils the world’s first model for a physical warp drive—one that doesn’t require negative energy.\n\nThe study is understandably pretty thick (read the whole thing here), but here’s the gist of the model: Where the existing paradigm uses negative energy—exotic matter that doesn’t exist and can’t be generated within our current understanding of the universe—this new concept uses floating bubbles of spacetime rather than floating ships in spacetime.\n\nThe physical model uses almost none of the negative energy and capitalizes on the idea that spacetime bubbles can behave almost however they like. And, the APL scientists say, this isn’t even the only other way warp speed could work. Making a model that’s at least physically comprehensible is a big step.\n\nPlus, Alcubierre himself has endorsed the new model, which is like having Albert Einstein show up to your introductory physics class.\n\nHere’s a helpful video in which Sabine Hossenfelder, a Professor and Research Fellow at the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies, breaks down the findings:\n\nOf course, there’s one gigantic caveat here: The concept in this paper is still in the “far future” zone of possibility, made of ideas that scientists still don’t know how to construct in any sense.\n\n“While the mass requirements needed for such modifications are still enormous at present,” the APL scientists write, “our work suggests a method of constructing such objects based on fully understood laws of physics.”\n\nBut while a physical drive may not be a reality today, tomorrow, or even a century from now—let’s hope it’s not that long—with this exciting new model, warp speed travel is now a lot more likely in a much shorter timespan than we previously thought.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "title": "Former “Mike & Molly” Star Billy Gardell Lost 170 Lbs. and Transformed His Life: ‘I Had to Make a Change’ (Exclusive)",
    "description": "“It saved my life,” Billy Gardell tells PEOPLE of his dramatic weight loss",
    "fullText": "For years Billy Gardell made himself the same promise: He was going to lose weight.\n\n“Every year,” says the comedian and former Mike & Molly. star. “I’d say I’d start on Monday. Or the first of the month. Or New Year’s Eve. That was always my routine.”\n\nSometimes he followed through, dropping dozens of pounds at a time before watching them inevitably creep back onto his 6-ft. frame. By 2020, when his weight started hovering around 370-380 lbs., and he developed type 2 diabetes, doctors warned him he was putting his life at risk. And then came COVID.\n\n“When the first wave hit, and they punched up that list of high-risk conditions, I had all of them,” says Gardell. “Overweight, sleep apnea, smoker, type 2 diabetes, asthma . . . It was really the perfect storm. Between my blood numbers not coming back good, my blood pressure going up, type 2 diabetes and COVID — it was enough stuff to scare me to say, ‘Come hell or high water, I’ve got to make a change.’ ”\n\nAnd change he did. On July 17, 2021, Gardell underwent bariatric surgery, the first step in a life-changing process to transform his relationship with food and finally take control of his health.\n\n“It really came down to a shift in everything I think about food,” says Gardell. “Food is fuel. It’s not reward, it’s not soothing, it’s not medication. I had to get beyond my emotional relationship with food.”\n\nSince the surgery, with regular workouts and careful attention to his diet, Gardell, 56, has lost more than 170 lbs. “I fluctuate between 210 and 215,” says the actor. “And that’s comfortable for me.” Even better, his health issues have receded. “My diabetes is gone,” he says. “I feel strong. I have energy. Losing weight saved my life.”\n\nThe PEOPLE Puzzler crossword is here! How quickly can you solve it? Play now!\n\nA self-described “chubby” kid, Gardell was born in Pittsburgh but grew up splitting his time between Pennsylvania and Florida after his parents divorced. Although he was active in sports, by his teen years his relationship with food had become complicated.\n\n“I had a lot of responsibility heaped on me at 14 to help provide for the family, and the second stepfather that we had in the house was not a kind person,” he says. “I think I put on this extra weight as some kind of safety armor.”\n\nAt 17, Gardell left home to pursue his dream of becoming a stand-up comedian, playing small clubs around the country and eating his way through both success and failure.\n\n“I was medicating my emotions and my fears with food, and I was also celebrating my victories with food,” he says. “You’re eating to deflect your feelings when they’re bad or enhance them when they’re good, and both of those things are poison pills.”\n\nOver the years, as the weight piled on, Gardell tried a myriad of diets. “I tried everything, low-carb, keto, intermittent fasting — and by the way, all those things work — but I just couldn’t stay consistent with any of them. I was on a yo-yo thing.”\n\nAnd for a while it didn’t seem to be a problem. His stand-up career built steadily — “the big guy is always funny,” he says — and in 2010 he landed the starring role opposite Melissa McCarthy on the hit CBS sitcom Mike & Molly. The show, about a couple who fall in love at an Overeaters Anonymous meeting, ran for six seasons and “changed my life,” says Gardell. “I was the romantic lead at 350 lbs.,” he marvels. “Life is so strange.”\n\nThree years later he found more television success with the comedy Bob Hearts Abishola, a show about a man who falls for his nurse while recovering from a heart attack.\n\nInevitably, though, his extra weight started taking a toll on his health. In addition to the diabetes, he developed joint and muscle pain that made moving difficult. “I had gotten so big and so stationary that it hurt to stand up,” he says. As he moved into his 50s, he worried about being there for his wife, Patty, and son Will, now 22, and twice consulted with a doctor about weight-loss surgery.\n\n“But I chickened out both times,” he says. Finally, after coming face-to-face with that “full bingo card” of high-risk health factors during COVID, he knew he had to take action. “The only thing I didn’t have on that list was being over 65, and that’s what I was trying to get to,” says the actor. “I was in enough desperation to make a change.”\n\nNever miss a story — \n\nFour years later Gardell credits his surgeon Dr. Philippe Quilici and nutritionist Teri Hlubik with making his transformation possible. “They’re the dream team,” he says. But he’s also well aware that it is on him to make the change last. And that required a major shift in his thinking about food.\n\n“Every change you want to make in your life starts between your ears,” he says. In weekly meetings with Hlubik — “almost like therapy” — he explored his emotional relationship with food, learned to replace junk-food comfort with fuel for his body and came to understand that he was worth the time and effort it took to get healthy. “You have to learn to love yourself,” he says. “You have to look at why you react the way you do to food and heal that, and then love yourself enough to do something good for yourself.”\n\nKeeping the weight off requires consistency, and Gardell maintains a strict routine: Breakfast is a turkey sausage breakfast sandwich, followed by cottage cheese and fruit in the afternoon and a light dinner that’s free from fried and sugar-laden foods. He also makes sure to drink 75 oz. of water each day, take daily multivitamins, a fish oil supplement and a probiotic, and get exercise three or four times a week. “It’s kinda like living in Groundhog Day, but it’s worth every bit of it,” says Gardell.\n\nHe does allow himself the occasional splurge. “I’m able to have a bite or two of something decadent if I want,” he says. “At a birthday party I took one forkful of cake just to taste it, and that was enough. I used to eat a whole pizza. Now I can have a slice and be satisfied.”\n\nAnd he also acknowledges that not every day is perfect — and that’s okay. “You’re never going to do it perfectly, but if you’re doing it eight out of 10 times, you’re going to win the battle,” he says. “My thing is I meditate, and I pray for consistency. I pray for gratitude, and I pray to remember the things that I’ve learned.”\n\nIn addition to dramatically improving his health — “I feel like I saved my life; I really do” — dropping the weight has also helped Gardell discover “magical” new experiences like surfing and horseback riding. “I can fly in a middle seat on an airplane now,” he says. “For a big person, that’s the unicorn! And I know it sounds silly, but I’m able to walk into a store and buy a shirt off the rack. That one brings me so much joy, I can’t even explain.”\n\nEven better, his transformation has brought him closer to Patty and Will, whom he calls the “secret power” who cheered him on through the process. Though neither ever pressured him to lose weight, they gave him the reason for reclaiming his health. “They want me around longer, God bless them,” says Gardell. “When a man knows what he’s fighting for, he’s capable of doing some amazing things. And those two are worth fighting for.”",

And doing great things, especially young entrepreneurs,\" Jena said.\n\nAt the same time, children watching adult content online \"has a very bad effect\".\n\nAt a Mumbai park, cricket coach Pratik Bhurke, 38, said Australia's move would encourage children to spend time outdoors and could have \"great benefits\" in India too.\n\nIn the chilly German capital, Luna Drewes, 13, is watching selfie-style TikTok clips posted by other young people.\n\n\"Actually a good thing in some ways because social media often portrays a certain image of how people should look, like girls have to be thin,\" she said of the ban.\n\nAnother teenager, Enno Caro Brandes, said: \"I'm 15 so for me the ban would definitely come into effect. I can't really imagine giving it up completely.\n\n\"A ban is a bit extreme, but it could definitely help to do a detox.\"\n\nAn AI baby singing and answering interview questions are among the videos served up to Firdha Razak, 16, as she scrolls in her room.\n\nRazak is not in favour of a ban. \"It's really stupid, honestly,\" although \"there's not really much we can do as 16-year-olds\" if governments decide to act, she said.\n\nThe families of many people in Qatar live abroad, so \"it's going to be so much harder to talk to them\".\n\nAlso in Doha, Youssef Walid, 16, said bans like Australia's were \"a bit harsh\" and hard to enforce.\n\n\"We can use VPN. We can easily bypass the security and easily make new accounts,\" he said.\n\n- Lagos: 'We were born with it' -\n\nAt a Nigerian high school, Mitchelle Okinedo is revising for exams, checking over her hand-written notes. In the classroom -- where phones are banned -- students in uniform sit at separate desks.\n\n\"I see where the (Australian) government is coming from. Students nowadays, they are really distracted,\" Okinedo said.\n\nEven so, \"we were born with it\", the 15-year-old added. \"And I don't think it's something I want to stop.\"\n\nHer mother, 50-year-old event planner Hannah Okinedo, agrees with a social media ban for under-16s, saying most parents \"don't have time to monitor their children all day\".\n\n- Mexico City: 'Express yourself' -\n\nYoung Mexico City resident Aranza Gomez, 11, has had a smartphone with access to social media for one year.\n\nWithout it, \"I would honestly feel sad. I wouldn't really have a good way to spend my time,\" she said.\n\nSantiago Ramirez Rojas, 16, is sitting on a bench in the Tabacalera district, scrolling through posts containing news about Argentina and tour dates for a musician.\n\n\"Social media today is very important for expressing yourself, no matter how old you are,\" said Rojas.\n\nBut \"there are many kidnappings that begin online\" and \"younger kids, around 10 or 12, are much more vulnerable\".\n\n- Sydney: 'Not going to have any impact' -\n\nIn Australia one family has diverging ideas on how the law will go.\n\n\"I don't think the government really knows what they're doing and I don't think it's going to have any impact on children of Australia,\" said 15-year-old Layton Lewis.\n\nBut his mother Emily Lewis hopes it will help children \"have better, more authentic relationships\".\n\n\"They'll make proper plans, like we used to, to meet up with their friends face-to-face and have proper conversations as opposed to these illusive friendships online,\" she said.",

    "description": "Research shows the Pacific hemisphere is losing heat faster than the African hemisphere. Here's why.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nResearch shows the Pacific hemisphere is losing heat faster than the African hemisphere.\n\nThe heat is from Earth’s molten interior, which causes continental drift.\n\nLandmass traps more heat than seafloor surface, indicating a hotter Pacific of the past.\n\nScientists from the University of Oslo say one side of Earth’s interior is losing heat much faster than the other side—and the culprit is practically as old as time.\n\nA study published in Geophysical Research Letters uses computer models of the last 400 million years to calculate how “insulated” each hemisphere was by continental mass, which is a key quality that holds heat inside instead of releasing it. The pattern goes all the way back to Pangaea.\n\nEarth has a red hot liquid interior that warms the entire planet from inside. It spins, too, generating both gravity and Earth’s magnetic field. This holds our protective atmosphere close to Earth’s surface.\n\nOver the extremely long term, this interior will continue to cool until Earth is more like Mars. The surprise in the study is how unevenly the heat is dissipating, but the reason makes intuitive sense: Parts of Earth have been insulated by more landmass, creating something of a Thermos layer that traps heat.\n\nThis contrasts with how Earth loses most of its heat: “Earth’s thermal evolution is largely controlled by the rate of heat loss through the oceanic lithosphere,” the study authors write. Why is this the site of the greatest loss? For that, we need a quick-and-dirty run-through of continental drift.\n\nEarth’s mantle is like a convection oven that powers a treadmill. Every day, seafloor surface moves a tiny bit; new seafloor is born from the magma that erupts at the continental divide, while old seafloor is smashed and melted beneath existing continental landmass.\n\nTo study how Earth’s interior heat behaves, the scientists built a model that divides Earth into African and Pacific hemispheres, then divides Earth’s entire surface into a grid by half degrees latitude and longitude.\n\nThe scientists combined several previous models for things like seafloor age and continental positions during the last 400 million years. Then, the team crunched the numbers for how much heat each grid cell contains over its long life. This paved the way to calculate the rate of cooling overall, where the researchers found the Pacific side has cooled much faster.\n\nThe seafloor is far thinner than the bulky landmass, and temperature from within Earth is “quenched” by the enormous volume of cold water that’s above it. Think of the gigantic Pacific Ocean compared with the opposite-side landmasses of Africa, Europe, and Asia—it makes sense that heat dissipates more quickly from the biggest seafloor in the world.\n\nPrevious research on this seafloor effect only went back 230 million years, meaning the new model, which goes back 400 million years, almost doubles the timeframe being studied.\n\nThere’s a surprising contradiction in the findings. The Pacific hemisphere has cooled about 50 Kelvin more than the African hemisphere, but the “consistently higher plate velocities of the Pacific hemisphere during the past 400 [million years]” suggest the Pacific was much hotter at a certain moment in time.\n\nWas it covered by landmass at some point in the far distant past, keeping more heat inside? There are other possible explanations, but either way, the Pacific’s high tectonic activity today points to a heat disparity. The meltier the mantle, the more the plates can slide and slam together.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

I was fortunate enough to have watched him play throughout his career and he played his part in the successes we enjoyed in the 1970s, not least in those unforgettable hat-tricks he scored against Hibs in two cup finals at Hampden.\n\n\"I was even more fortunate to get to know him personally over the past few years, and it was always great to meet him here at Celtic Park on a matchday.\n\n\"What was always clear was his real love of Celtic and also the love that supporters had for him too.\"",

    "fullText": "Tourists visiting the Amazon in Brazil experienced a harrowing incident while enjoying the waters of Miriti Beach. People Magazine reported that piranhas attacked a group of swimmers, including a 7-month-old baby.\n\nNumerous people were attacked and injured by piranhas while swimming at a resort beach in Manacapuru, Brazil. Tourists rushed out of the water as victims suffered severe cuts from bites.\n\nA 7-month-old baby lost part of their toe after being bitten in the water. The baby was taken to a local hospital for further treatment while firefighters tended to bite wounds on the beach.\n\nAccording to People, the piranha attacks occurred throughout the day. Due to the attacks, the Manacapuru city council has advised all swimmers to avoid going into the water \"until the fish disperse.\"\n\nThe piranha attacks along the resort beach in Manacapuru underscore a larger problem of overdevelopment and habitat encroachment. Piranhas are native to the Amazon basin; however, when resorts are built in remote areas near wildlife habitats, they disrupt local ecosystems and can lead to dangerous human-wildlife interactions.\n\nExperts viewed this particular incident of piranha attacks as a warning from a species that views tourists as a danger to their nests.\n\n\"The fish act defensively and usually deliver a single warning bite to drive away intruders rather than launching sustained attacks,\" biologist and aquatic ecology expert Edinbergh Caldas Oliveira told Brazilian news outlet G1, per the Associated Press. \"Such incidents are accidents caused by human interference with natural habitats.\"\n\nIn response to the numerous bites, officials told visitors to avoid swimming in remote areas of the beach. Local fishermen noted the piranha attacks could be related to the species' breeding season, advising swimmers to exercise precautions.\n\nFrom an environmental perspective, cities can prevent these types of human-wildlife interactions from occurring by establishing clear nature preserves to prevent resorts from encroaching on wildlife habitats. By vacationing responsibly and researching eco-tourism options, you can explore the world while respecting nature.\n\nDo you think America does a good job of protecting its natural beauty?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A man who says members of a secretive North Carolina religious group held him down and beat him wants the prosecutor kicked off his case, accusing the district attorney of siding with a church that dozens of former congregants have said abused them.\n\nMatthew Fenner said in court documents that he has waited more than eight years for a retrial in the kidnapping and assault case involving Word of Faith Fellowship only for District Attorney Ted Bell to schedule the second trial for a church leader during the week Fenner had interviews for a medical residency. Fenner said Bell has refused to delay it.\n\nIn a sworn statement, Fenner said Bell wants to stay on Word of Faith’s good side because he supports the locally influential church and its hundreds of members in the small county who could stay in his favor for his reelection bid in 2026.\n\nBell said the allegations about how he has handled the case are all false and that he will respond to all of Fenner's allegations in court.\n\n“I remain committed to fulfilling my duties with integrity, professionalism, and an unwavering dedication to justice,” Bell said in a written statement.\n\nFenner alleges Bell stopped talking to him, refused to interview new witnesses and investigate new evidence, and asked him to drop the case.\n\n“If the Court does not intervene and remove Bell from this case, the trial will be lost before it begins. And it will be lost not because of a fair adjudication of the merits; rather, it will be lost due to DA Bell’s actions that manufactured that result,” Fenner’s lawyer wrote in court papers.\n\nA leader of Word of Faith, Brooke Covington, was scheduled to stand trial this week on second-degree kidnapping and simple assault charges, but that has been delayed to consider Fenner's request. Covington's previous trial on the same charges ended in a mistrial after the jury foreman brought his own research into deliberations. Covington has maintained she is innocent.\n\nFenner joined Word of Faith as a teenager in 2010 with his mother. He was at a service at the church’s compound in Spindale, North Carolina, when members including Covington started what the church called a “blasting” session on him, according to Fenner. Members held him down and choked and beat him for two hours while others prayed to expel “homosexual demons,” Fenner said.\n\nThe judge at the 2017 trial wanted to retry the case in months. Initial delays were because a lawyer had health problems. The court record does not provide information about other delays. Other documents in the court file are related to efforts to move the case from small, rural Rutherford County where the Word of Faith is headquartered to Buncombe County and more populous and urban Asheville.\n\nA judge placed a gag order on Fenner, Covington, the lawyers and potential witnesses.\n\nFenner alleges in his sworn statement that the district attorney did not oppose the gag order because he wanted to weaken the case and put pressure on Fenner to give up.\n\nAn attorney for Covington had no comment on the delay or Fenner's allegations.\n\nWord of Faith is a nondenominational Protestant church that was founded in 1979 by Sam and Jane Whaley in the foothills of Blue Ridge Mountains between Charlotte and Asheville. Members consider Jane Whaley a prophet.\n\nIn 2017, The Associated Press published a series of stories about Word of Faith that detailed former church members' allegations of abuse. The AP spoke dozens of former congregants around the world, listened to hours secretly recorded conversations with church leaders, and reviewed hundreds of pages of law enforcement, court and child welfare documents.\n\nThe AP reported that the church controlled almost every aspect of their members’ lives including who they married, what subjects they studied in school and whether they could go to college. Members were regularly slapped, choked and thrown to the floor during high-decibel group prayer.\n\nThe AP investigation found that the church and its hundreds of followers controlled law enforcement and social services, preventing fair investigations.\n\nWhaley has denied that she or other church leaders ever abused Word of Faith members. She has also said that any discipline would be protected by the Constitution's freedom of religion tenet.\n\nThe church said the allegations made to the AP were false and made by “certain former members” out to target the church and that it does not condone abuse.",

    "fullText": "UK mortgage lending recorded its strongest quarterly jump in five years in the third quarter of 2025, with gross advances rising 36.9% to £80.4bn, according to new data from the Bank of England (BoE). The increase marks the sharpest quarterly gain since 2020 amid a renewed surge in the UK property market.\n\nThe total value of outstanding residential mortgages rose 0.9% in the quarter to £1,733.7bn, 2.9% higher than a year earlier. New mortgage commitments increased 1.6% to £79.4bn, the highest since the third quarter of 2022 and 20.3% higher than a year ago.\n\nHigher-risk lending continued to expand. The share of high loan-to-value (LTV) lending, with LTVs above 90% rising by 0.3 percentage points to 7.4%, the highest since the second quarter of 2008 and 0.8 percentage points higher than a year earlier.\n\nLending to borrowers with elevated loan-to-income ratios increased by 3.3 percentage points to 44.7%, the largest quarterly rise since the third quarter of 2020, though still 0.6 percentage points below last year’s level.\n\nOwner-occupier purchase activity strengthened. House purchase loans accounted for 58.6% of gross advances, up 2.5 percentage points on the quarter but still 5.8 percentage points lower than a year earlier. Remortgaging for owner-occupation decreased by 0.4 percentage points to 28.6%, but remained 5.8 percentage points higher year-on-year.\n\nMortgage performance indicators also improved. Outstanding balances in arrears fell 2.9% to £20.6bn and were 5.8% lower than a year earlier. The proportion of total mortgage balances in arrears held steady at 1.2%, 0.1 percentage points below last year’s level. New arrears cases accounted for 8.8% of all arrears balances, down 0.1 percentage points on the quarter and at their lowest since Q1 2022.\n\nRichard Pike, chief sales and marketing officer at Phoebus Software, said: “These figures demonstrate the mortgage market was in rude health over the summer, with overall lending up for the seventh consecutive quarter.\n\n“Gross advances saw the largest quarterly increase for five years as borrowers took advantage of falling rates following the Bank of England’s base rate cut in August.\n\n“New mortgage commitments were also at their highest since Q3 2020, showing a strong pipeline for lenders for the rest of the year.”\n\nHe added: “Just under half of this lending (44.7%) was to borrowers with high loan-to-income ratio as mortgage companies offer more low-deposit products. This is opening the possibility of home ownership to more people and stimulating market activity but comes with higher risk.",

    "description": "Weeks after ABC13 first reported on the practices of Unique Green, investigators have now filed a new search warrant outlining further concerns, including possible fraud and tampering with a corpse.",
    "fullText": "New allegations have surfaced against a Houston funeral home operator, who is already under scrutiny for running multiple businesses without a proper license.\n\nWeeks after ABC13 first reported on the practices of Unique Green, investigators have now filed a new search warrant outlining further concerns, including possible fraud and tampering with a corpse.\n\nThe latest warrant identifies a second funeral home, Wingate on White Heather, and centers on the estate of Lawrence Edward Gammon, adding to ongoing questions surrounding Green's funeral business operations.\n\nAccording to the 16-page document obtained by ABC13, authorities are looking into whether Green misrepresented herself after handling Gammon's cremation in order to steal from his estate.\n\nIn June, the warrant says, Gammon's out-of-state relatives called Houston police after not hearing from him for a month. Officers went to his home on Tottenham Drive and found his badly decomposed body in a bedroom. The home was so cluttered, firefighters had to break a window, records say, to remove him. His manner of death was ruled natural, according to an autopsy.\n\nLater that month, the man's relatives contacted Wingate and spoke to Green, they told police. The warrant shows they paid her thousands of dollars and shared Gammon's financial information with her. With that information, police believe she forged a will and stole cars, property, and cash worth nearly $2 million from Gammon's estate.\n\nABC13 found a last will and testament filed in Harris County in August, months after Gammon's death, that left \"my entire estate to my long-term partner and common law spouse, Unique M. Green, in recognition of her unwavering love, devotion and support.\" The will lists checking and investment accounts, three vehicles, and other personal property as part of the estate.\n\nThe warrant says investigators detected factual errors and determined the will was forged. Additionally, Gammon's family had never heard of Green.\n\nThe warrant also connects Green to Wingate Funeral Home through recorded phone calls. One investigator wrote:\n\n\"I recorded my conversation with the person who answered the phone call and recognized the distinct voice to be Unique Mica Battle-Green. The suspect answered the phone, stating 'Wingate Funeral Home.'\"\n\nThe new allegations come just weeks after law enforcement raided A Community Funeral Home on Wheeler in Houston's Third Ward. That business, which authorities say Green has operated for years without a license, was previously the subject of 13 Investigates reporting.\n\nSEE ALSO: 'Appalling': County cut ties in 2020 with funeral home raided by HPD\n\nGreen already faces a criminal charge in connection with the Third Ward property, where she is accused of forging a lien. She has not been charged in connection with the Gammon case or Wingate, which is now shuttered.\n\nGreen has also appeared publicly before the Harris County Commissioners Court, urging officials to award her a contract for indigent burials despite the alleged licensing issues.\n\nOn Tuesday, ABC13 called a number associated with Green. A woman who identified herself as Green's sister answered, but hung up once questions about the investigation began. Later, in a separate call, a person said Green was in Dallas, but then texted to say she would meet ABC13 at the funeral home on Wheeler. Green never showed.\n\nAuthorities say their probe remains active as they examine both funeral homes and Green's involvement with each.",

    "description": "A few recurring problems plagued the Mammoth again on Monday. Here’s what they’re doing about them.",
    "fullText": "The Utah Mammoth are finally home from their tour of North America, but that doesn’t mean things will be easier for them.\n\nThey learned that with their 4-2 loss to the Los Angeles Kings at the Delta Center on Monday. Here’s the story.\n\nA two-goal deficit is one of the worst ways to start a hockey game, but that’s challenge the Mammoth faced in this one.\n\nBoth of the Kings’ early goals came off of odd-man rushes — a 3-on-2 which turned into a partial break for Adrian Kempe and a full-on breakaway for Joel Armia.\n\nBrandon Tanev answered with a breakaway goal of his own to cut the Kings’ lead in half, but a successful offside challenge took the tally off the board.\n\nDylan Guenther opened the second period with a power play one-timer goal, but Anže Kopitar restored the Kings’ two-goal lead at the beginning of the third.\n\nThe Mammoth pulled back within one courtesy of a sweet backhander by Clayton Keller, but their 6-on-5 struggles continued as Armia sent one into the empty net.\n\n🚨Gunner on the power play! pic.twitter.com/dHYagZRGTA\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 9, 2025\n\nThe culprit in the Mammoth’s last two games has been bad first periods.\n\nIn Calgary on Saturday, the Flames scored what ended up being the game-winning goal 16 seconds into the game. It wasn’t quite as drastic against the Kings on Monday, but allowing them to take a 2-0 lead into the first intermission created a hole that was hard to get out of.\n\n“In the first period, we definitely gave them too much space,” said Utah head coach André Tourginy. “We let them take the middle on the rush, so they had too many (zone) entries. ... By giving them the lead, that made them play their strengths even more.”\n\nWhile the Mammoth have historically been good in the first period and awful in the second, the last handful of games have been the opposite.\n\nUp to and including their loss in San Jose on Dec. 1, the Mammoth had a -13 goal differential in second periods. Over the last four games, however, they’re +4 in the middle frame — and they haven’t given up a single second-period goal in that stretch.\n\nIt would be easy to blame poor starts on the tough travel: seven games spanning four states and two provinces in the last 11 days, but Tourigny didn’t take that option.\n\n“I don’t want to use that as an excuse,” he said. “It’s there, but so (it is for) the other team. (In the) NHL, there’s nobody who will feel sorry for you. It’s not a league where you have to find excuses — it’s not like that. You need to find solutions, you need to find a way.\"\n\nTourigny has frequently mentioned the parity in the NHL: On most given nights, the bulk of the games will be decided by just one goal (excluding empty-netters).\n\nSince the beginning of November, 10 of the Mammoth’s 14 losses have been exactly that way. That should encourage players and fans alike: They’re one good play short of better outcomes in most of these situations.\n\nThey just need one more guy to step up every night.\n\nTourigny couldn’t point to a particular pattern that has led to so many one-goal losses, but speaking on this game in particular, he broke down the Kings’ second goal, when Armia snuck in behind Utah’s defensemen before accepting a stretch pass to send him on a breakaway.\n\n“The second goal should have never happened,” Tourigny said. “We’re casual, and that’s the difference in the game. That’s how tight the league is.”\n\nThat should be encouraging for Mammoth fans: This isn’t a matter of skill, it’s a matter of consistency — and it is a surmountable problem.\n\nAnother shift or two of buy-in from each line is all it’s going to take for Utah to come out on the winning side of the bulk of these games.\n\nMammoth social media circles have been filled with requests for a coaching change, but Keller shut that idea down in his postgame interview.\n\n“We know what we need to do each night. The coaches do a great job of telling us how we have to play and how we can break them down and have success,” he said.\n\n“I think our execution was a little sloppy tonight, but as the game went on, I think it got a little bit better.”\n\nAs mentioned after the team’s loss in San Jose last week, coaching changes typically only happen when the players stop buying into the coaches’ messages. As captain, part of Keller’s job is to speak for the players — and right now, the players are saying that coaching isn’t the problem.\n\nThe onus is now on Keller and the other 22 players on the roster to show that this is the group that it’ll take to accomplish their stated goal of making the playoffs this season.\n\nNHL Edge doesn’t publicly keep track of the league’s hardest backhanders, but if it did, Keller’s goal may have been atop the list.\n\nThe backhander is the most difficult shot to take with any degree of strength or accuracy, which is why they almost exclusively happen from in tight. But this one was good enough to beat 2025 Vezina Trophy finalist Darcy Kuemper point-blank.\n\nBack-handed beauty from the Captain 🫡 pic.twitter.com/WgVBFhihmn\n\n— Utah Mammoth (@utahmammoth) December 9, 2025",

    "fullText": "As the winter transfer window approaches, Paulo Dybala’s future is once again in the spotlight.\n\nAccording to La Repubblica, a meeting is scheduled for the coming days between Roma management and the Argentine striker’s agent, Carlos Novel, to discuss the path forward and the terms of a mutually satisfactory agreement.\n\nAt the same time, rumors of an early departure have intensified, with Boca Juniors indicated as a preferred destination, ready to welcome him as early as January.\n\nIn Buenos Aires, his friend and former teammate Leandro Paredes is benefiting, having repeatedly expressed his desire to share the footballing experience with Dybala again.\n\nAt present, there does not appear to be any reason for an imminent departure.\n\nDybala is happy in Rome, where he has chosen to build his personal life and raise his daughter, who is expected in March.\n\nThis emotional bond with the capital, however, does not appear to be sufficient to secure his professional future. The sticking point remains his contract renewal, which is currently on hold.\n\nAny negotiations will have to comply with the guidelines set by the Friedkins, which are geared toward investing in players under 30 and reducing the burden of higher salaries.\n\nDybala is the exception: “La Joya” commands approximately €8.5 million net per season. The Argentine’s contract expires on June 30, 2026, and will not be renewed under the same financial conditions.\n\nFor Roma, this is a strategic decision, balancing financial sustainability with the need to retain one of the squad’s key players. The upcoming meeting could mark a crucial step in outlining future scenarios.",

    "fullText": "Manchester United enjoyed a goalfest at Molineux Stadium, winning 4-1 against Wolverhampton Wanderers.\n\nBruno Fernandes, Mason Mount and Bryan Mbeumo all got on the scoresheet on Monday night, taking full advantage of the 20th-placed side’s shaky defending.\n\nBut it was a frustrating return to the Midlands for Matheus Cunha, who lacked incisiveness around the goalmouth. Cunha scored 15 times in the Premier League for Wolves last season, but he has just one goal to his name at United.\n\nIf the Brazilian left winger continues to underwhelm, United might be compelled to bring in another left-sided attacker to strengthen their ranks.\n\nBefore Amorim arrived, Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho competed for the starting spot out on the left at Old Trafford. However, the pair fell out with the Portuguese.\n\nThe Red Devils sent Garnacho to Chelsea in a permanent deal. Rashford, meanwhile, was loaned out to Barcelona. The La Liga giants do have an option to buy the Englishman but their transfer strategy remains uncertain.\n\nThe England international is thriving at Barca, leading to long-term admirers Paris Saint-Germain reigniting their interest in his services.\n\nAccording to Fichajes, United are considering using Rashford to secure the signature of a PSG left winger.\n\nThe Spanish outlet claim United are interested in Bradley Barcola and are “seriously” planning to sign him next summer.\n\nThe 23-year-old Frenchman is known for his dazzling dribbling, lightning-fast feet, and versatility. His profile fits perfectly with the Premier League giants’ emphasis on young and dynamic players.\n\nIt is understood United are considering a swap deal involving Barcola and Rashford.\n\nThe France international has 31 goals and 33 assists to his name in 121 appearances for PSG. However, he has struggled for regular starts following the arrival of Khvicha Kvaratskhelia.\n\nFurther, negotiations to renew the €70m-rated forward’s contract at PSG have allegedly stalled. Accordingly, United are looking to capitalise on Barcola’s situation.\n\nFeatured image Alex Caparros via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Mark Wood has been ruled out of the rest of the Ashes series in a major injury blow for England.\n\nWood featured in the opening Test in Perth but suffered a left knee issue, bowling just 11 overs before being declared unavailable before the defeat in Brisbane.\n\nThe 35-year-old, who missed the entire English summer after a nine-month recovery from knee surgery, has now been ruled out of the entirety of the series, leaving captain Ben Stokes without his most experienced seamer and fastest bowler as England look to fight back from 2-0 down.\n\n“Gutted to be out the remainder of the Ashes,” Wood posted on Instagram. “After extensive surgery and seven long, hard months of work and rehab to get back into the test arena, my knee just hasn't held up.\n\n“None of us expected this. I came here with high expectations about making a big impact. I’m desperately disappointed that despite yet more injections and intensive medical treatment it has become clear that the flare up in my knee is worse than feared.\n\n“I’m really sorry that has left me unable to perform as expected but it is not for want of trying. I still believe we can turn things around. Never give in. Come on England.”\n\nSurrey’s Matthew Fisher has been called up to the squad ahead of the third Test in Adelaide, which begins on 17 December. Fisher has one international cap, earned on a tour of the West Indies in the absence of James Anderson and Stuart Broad in 2022 while at Yorkshire.\n\nWhile not as quick as Wood, Fisher produced an impressive first season in the County Championship at Surrey after moving south, although was wicketless for the England Lions in a heavy defeat to Australia A in Brisbane this week.\n\nAustralia, meanwhile, have confirmed that Josh Hazlewood will play no part in the series. The 34-year-old fast bowler suffered a hamstring problem ahead of the Ashes and is now experiencing an achilles issue.\n\nIt is hoped that Hazlewood may return for the T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in February.\n\n\"(I'm) really flat for him,\" head coach Andrew McDonald said of Hazlewood.\n\n\"A couple of setbacks that we didn't see coming. We thought he'd play a huge part in the series but really feel for him that he won't get that opportunity.\"\n\nIn better news for McDonald, captain Pat Cummins is in line to return to the Australian side as they look to seal the series at the Adelaide Oval.\n\nA cautious approach had been taken over Cummins as he dealt with a back injury but he is now deemed ready to feature.\n\n“We feel as though the simulation in the nets has got him skill ready. His body's ready to go,\" said McDonald.\n\n\"Barring anything else happening in the next week, I'd be expecting Pat to be tossing the coin and putting the blazer on.\n\n\"He was out at Allan Border Field whilst everyone was at the Gabba; he simulated pretty much what a match will look like out there with multiple spells.\n\n\"There won't be any match opportunities for Pat (before Adelaide) and this is something we've done with Pat before long-ish layoffs, where we've put some time and effort into rebuilding his body.\n\n\"So we feel as though he'll be as best prepared as can be.\"\n\nOnly one team in Test history has ever come from 2-0 down to win a Test series, an Australian side led by Don Bradman in the 1936/37 Ashes on home soil.",

    "fullText": "It must be said that eyebrows were raised when the overall package was announced upon Salah’s eventual renewal. He would be tied to the Anfield club until 2027 - earning £400k per week in the process.\n\nThose numbers suit a peak talent - and a world-class player. But Salah was just about to turn 33 when he signed. He will be 35 by the time the deal expires. There aren’t that many 35-year-old wingers out there these days - not least one playing for a top club.\n\nAnd you will scour the top five leagues for a forward player that age earning anything close to what Salah is bringing home.\n\nRight now we must admit that Salah isn’t playing like a £20m per year forward. Haaland by comparison is averaging very, very close to a goal a game this season for his mammoth paycheck. Salah isn’t.\n\nNor was he ever likely to repeat last season’s exploits. Given the wholesale disruption which took place across the club last summer it would have taken a monumental effort to sustain that output.\n\nThen you need to factor in what was always due to happen in Salah’s international career this season.\n\nThe Pharaoh talisman is no doubt closing in on the end of his playing days. The missing piece of the jigsaw in his trophy cabinet is of course the Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nHe will be desperate to finally right that wrong.\n\nFor three Afcon tournaments in a row - prior to Salah’s arrival on the scene - everything Egypt touched turned to gold. But it will be 16 barren years by the time the tournament concludes in January.\n\nHis participation at Afcon was always likely to rule him out for a month or even more. That’s £2m from the latest renewal that Liverpool won’t be seeing any value out of.\n\nThen there’s the FIFA World Cup.\n\nEgypt missed out in 2022 - and back in 2018 - when Salah was at his undoubted peak - he was recovering from the injury inflicted upon him by Sergio Ramos.\n\nHis national team NEED him - and he in turn has a great chance to definitively etch his name in the country’s collective football history. And if Salah plans to be fresh for the World Cup then it’s going to take a toll.\n\nHe will be returning to Anfield exhausted - and at the age of 34 rolling straight into another gruelling season.\n\nIf this was the profile of a potential new signing - a 33-year-old winger whose form tailed off towards the end of the season and whose pay packet is £400k per week and who will be playing TWO international tournaments in 12 months - then do you really think Liverpool’s data specialists woud sign him?\n\nOf course not - and his previous output would count for precisely nothing.\n\nSo what gives? Why exactly did Richard Hughes see fit to offer Salah a two-year £40m deal when the stakes were so high?\n\nMaybe Liverpool didn’t want to wave Salah goodbye without banking a fee. Last summer he would have left for nothing - entitled to choose his next club.\n\nThere is a premium for that - either in January or else next summer. So the club might have always assumed that Salah wouldn’t see out all of his contract until 2027 - and instead planned to offload him to any team willing to pay a decent transfer fee.\n\nGiven the wages it will take quite a lot to cover that expense as well as a transfer fee so it is a very select market for the Egyptian King in January or beyond.\n\nSaudi clubs haven’t been as prone to throwing that kind of money around for players in their 30s of late - even Ronaldo came on a free after terminating his Manchester United deal.\n\nBeyond the SPL though and it’s hard to see any big teams coughing up a fee and wages for Salah.\n\nThe future right now looks very uncertain - and Liverpool will clearly not be wanting to pay £20m a year to Salah until the end of his contract if he’s not even playing.",

    "description": "Marko is on his way out of Red Bull following a meeting with Red Bull's top management on Monday",
    "fullText": "Helmut Marko is set for retirement as Red Bull’s motorsport advisor in Formula 1, despite an initial contract for 2026.\n\nImmediately after the title decider at the Yas Marina Circuit, uncertainty over Helmut Marko’s future at Red Bull began to trickle through the paddock. When asked, the Austrian stated that discussions would take place later in the week. Whereas the 82-year-old had previously pointed to his ongoing contract, he did not do so this time.\n\n“It’s a complex [set] of different things,” he said. When asked what his own preference would be, Marko replied: “I have to sleep over it, and then we’ll see.”\n\nThe discussions Marko referred to on Sunday night took place on Monday in Abu Dhabi with Red Bull’s top management – including sporting CEO Oliver Mintzlaff. The outcome is that Marko is set for retirement at the end of this calendar year as Red Bull’s motorsport advisor, noting that his influence in practice went beyond what that job title suggested.\n\nMarko’s contract had initially been extended for two more years and covered the 2026 season as well, but that term will not be completed.\n\nTeam principal Laurent Mekies already hinted on Sunday night that changes were looming. Asked about Marko’s comments, the French team boss did little to quell the rumours.\n\n“Helmut has been incredible in how supportive he has been in helping us to turn around things this year. Obviously him and the top management had quite a few difficult decisions to make in the year, and of course we always have. But Formula 1 is not a static environment, you always adjust your organisations, and it applies to technical, it applies to sporting.”\n\nMekies subtly indicated that Red Bull was looking at ways to make its leadership structure future-proof.\n\n“It's completely normal that we review how we can improve the way we operate all the time. So I'm not saying that specifically for Helmut, but I'm saying that in general we are in an environment where we always challenge each other and look for the next steps, no matter how small it is in trying to work together. But I can only thank Helmut for the role he has played in making what looked like a difficult situation at the mid-season making work with the support,” said Mekies, who took over from Christian Horner this past summer.\n\nSuggestions in the paddock are that the Austrian parent company might take a firmer grip. One option could be to involve Mintzlaff and his team more closely in the running of Red Bull's F1 operations. A new head of PR has also been put forward from the Austrian headquarters, after Paul Smith – who previously held that position – had to leave the team at the same time as Horner.\n\nWith Marko’s upcoming retirement, an era spanning 21 years will come to an end. The former Le Mans 24 Hours winner from Graz was put forward as Dietrich Mateschitz’s right-hand man to help build Red Bull Racing after the team was acquired from Jaguar ahead of the 2005 season. Marko took charge of the junior programme that produced, among others, Sebastian Vettel and Max Verstappen.\n\nWhereas Mercedes initially wanted to place Verstappen in GP2 for a year, Marko immediately offered the Dutchman an F1 seat at sister team Toro Rosso for 2015. The loyalty between the two has long been mutual since then. When Marko’s position came under pressure around the 2024 Saudi Arabian Grand Prix, amid the Horner power struggles, Verstappen firmly came to his defence. As of 31 December 2025, however, that cooperation seems to formally come to an end.\n\nClive Rose / Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nRudy Carezzevoli / Getty Images\n\nSteven Tee / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nSam Bagnall / Sutton Images via Getty Images\n\nAndy Hone/ LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nSam Bagnall / Sutton Images via Getty Images\n\nAndy Hone/ LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nSam Bagnall / Sutton Images via Getty Images\n\nSteven Tee / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nSteven Tee / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nAndy Hone/ LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nAndy Hone/ LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nSam Bagnall / Sutton Images via Getty Images\n\nMark Sutton / Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nRudy Carezzevoli / Getty Images\n\nClive Rose / Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nClive Rose / Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nZak Mauger / LAT Images via Getty Images\n\nClive Rose / Formula 1 via Getty Images\n\nRudy Carezzevoli / Getty Images\n\nRudy Carezzevoli / Getty Images\n\nChanges at Red Bull?

    "description": "HoopsHype ranks the five players who have appeared most often in trade rumors over the previous week, headlined this week by Giannis Antetokounmpo.",
    "fullText": "As we inch closer to the NBA trade deadline of 2026-27, bigger names are starting to pop up in rumors, including that of one former NBA MVP and Defensive Player of the Year.\n\nToday, that player leads off our latest Trade Rumors Rankings series, in which we rank the five players who have appeared most often in trade rumors over the previous week.\n\nFour-time All-Star Trae Young hasn't played since Oct. 29, and yet the Atlanta Hawks are off to as good a start as they've had in years, sitting at 14-11.\n\nLike other enigmatic point guards, Young has heard his name mentioned in trade rumors this season, including in this report from ESPN:\n\nCharlotte's LaMelo Ball, Memphis' Ja Morant and Atlanta's Trae Young all seem to be stuck in a sort of limbo with the franchises that they've been the faces of since entering the league as high lottery picks. There is rampant speculation among rival teams that Ball, Morant and Young could all be available leading up to the Feb. 5 trade deadline. For a variety of reasons, from their maximum contracts to their major flaws, it's not a discussion that generates much enthusiasm despite their status as big names who have put up big numbers. \"I wouldn't want any of them,\" a Western Conference general manager told ESPN. That was a popular opinion in an informal poll of executives, scouts and coaches conducted by ESPN. There wasn't a consensus about which one of the three would command the biggest return if they ended up getting shopped in the trade market, as votes were split among Ball, Morant and Young. \"They all might have negative value,\" an Eastern Conference executive said.\n\nSpeaking of how well the Hawks are playing without Young, an anonymous source criticized Young more to ESPN:\n\nIn other words, the Hawks with Young in the lineup would rank dead last in the league in defensive efficiency. Without him, the Hawks have defended at a top-five level. \"He's just small and doesn't play any defense,\" an East scout said. That scout valued Young more than Morant and Ball, primarily because of his offensive prowess and lack of off-court concerns. Several people mentioned the long-running perception that he's unpopular with teammates as worrisome, especially considering that Young creates so many dunks and open looks with his passing prowess.\n\nThe thing is, Young has proven in the past to be up to the task of leading a team on a deep playoff run. He just has to have a great team around him. Maybe Atlanta will be fine staying put with Young at the helm once he returns, as the team does have a strong roster this season.\n\nEither way, it doesn't seem his trade value is all that high right now.\n\nFor the latest Trae Young rumors, click here.\n\nThe New Orleans Pelicans, owners of the worst record in the NBA at 3-22, don't have much going right for them these days, including Zion Williamson being set to miss even more time due to injury. As such, the team is naturally hearing a lot of noise as far as potential trades recently.\n\nOne player who has come up in such rumors is 25-year-old swingman Trey Murphy, who is averaging 20.5 points and 6.5 rebounds on 36.3 three-point percent shooting this season.\n\nAccording to NBA reporter Jake Fischer, the Pelicans are starting to listen to offers on the Murphy trade front:\n\nAnd there are definitely teams that believe that have told me as recently as today that New Orleans is now starting to listen and at least show some type of willingness to listen on guys like Herb Jones and Trey Murphy as well. And those guys are going to have a lot of interest around the league.\n\nThat report was negated by a Pelicans blogger, though…\n\nSharmit Dua: The Pelicans have not had any conversations with teams regarding Trey Murphy, Herb Jones, or Zion Williamson per source familiar with the matter\n\n…so it should be taken for what it’s worth.\n\nIn the NBA, players are untouchable until they aren’t, and considering how far off the Pelicans are from contention, there shouldn’t be a player on their roster who is not up for grabs on the trade market, at least anyone who isn’t a rookie.\n\nNew Orleans is certainly a team that should be kept an eye on as we get closer to the trade deadline.\n\nFor the latest Trey Murphy rumors, click here.\n\nFischer dropped another surprising nugget recently when he reported that the Miami Heat of all teams have had internal discussions about picking up Ja Morant.\n\nMiami was already shaping into a surprising buyer on this trade market even before this week's Giannis headlines. League sources say that the Heat, for example, have had internal discussions about Memphis' Ja Morant and how Miami's infrastructure could benefit him.\n\nWe’re not entirely sure how that fit would work, especially with how steady Davion Mitchell has been running point for Miami this season. With the Heat performing better than expected this year, and the team fully at peace after the departure of Jimmy Butler, going after Morant doesn’t make the most sense for Miami, in our estimation.\n\nAt the same time, there’s no denying his massive talent level. And Miami probably won’t contend this season without more truly elite talent, so who knows? Maybe this is a swing they decide to take in an attempt to hit a grand slam.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, the Sacramento Kings and Minnesota Timberwolves are monitoring the Morant trade front:\n\nTeams such as Sacramento and the Minnesota Timberwolves (and likely many more) that were known to be monitoring the situation before will continue to do so, all while watching closely when Ja Morant returns (his initial timeline had him slated for a possible early December return). Still, the Grizzlies going from their loud and ugly 4-11 start to this quiet and impressive bounce-back (now 9-12) is enough to make these next few months all the more interesting in Memphis.\n\nWith so much smoke, the Morant situation in Memphis is one that has to continue to be monitored.\n\nFor the latest Ja Morant rumors, click here.\n\nSince returning from injury, former No. 1 pick Anthony Davis has shown flashes of his former prime self, enjoying 32- and 29-point performances. Overall, in his last four games, Davis is averaging 20.0 points, 11.5 rebounds, 4.0 assists and 1.8 blocks on 51.5 percent shooting.\n\nHowever, according to a recent report, teams might be hesitant to trade for Davis anyway due to cap restrictions:\n\nThe reluctance of teams to trade multiple first round picks into the future is expected to impact the trade packages for Davis and potentially even Giannis Antetokounmpo. \"What I'm telling you is that when I talk to executives and these executives are not in trade talks with the Bucks or another for a star player right now, the mood in the NBA right now is not give up four first round picks for anybody,\" said Brian Windhorst on The Hoop Collective podcast on Friday. \"Okay, maybe if Shai (Gilgeous-Alexander) came on, or Victor (Wembanyama)... Like people don't want to do that because the aprons have spooked so many teams. All these teams are worried about getting into apron trouble where they can't reset their rosters. And you get into a situation like the Celtics were in where you got to rip your team down.\"\n\nAlso making teams wary is his troubling injury history, including in this very season:\n\nBrian Windhorst: I don't know what the value of Anthony Davis. Some of the stuff that I have heard from executives talking to me about what they think Anthony Davis' trade value is… I'm not even going to say it because then I'd get aggregated and people would be jumping down my throat and I would just be repeating something somebody else said. When I have heard what people are saying Anthony Davis' trade value is right now, not because of him as a player, to be clear, not because he's diminished as a player, but because of the idea of paying an injury-prone mid-30s guy $50, $60 million dollars in the apron era is unpalatable.\n\nWe aren’t entirely sure how the Davis saga unfolds. On one hand, he doesn’t fit the team’s current time frame, especially not with Kyrie Irving set to miss so much of this season. On the other, the Mavericks are a proud franchise and winners of four of their last five, so maybe they’d rather try to compete with Davis now healthy.\n\nFor the latest Anthony Davis rumors, click here.\n\nThe most interesting storyline of this trade deadline centers in Wisconsin, as reports have indicated that Giannis Antetokounmpo has already asked out of Milwaukee in favor of joining the New York Knicks…\n\nBrian Windhorst: The Bucks called the Knicks and asked for an offer for Giannis Antetokounmpo, because Giannis said, 'I want to be a Knick.' .... Guys, Giannis has asked to be traded already. It appears Giannis committed to himself for the season to the Bucks. But the Bucks are not good. This year, when Giannis hasn't played, the Bucks are 1-5. When he has played, they're 9-8. Would his viewpoint change? I don't know.\n\n…while the Bucks have reportedly told teams that the Greek superstar is not available:\n\nAs trade season draws close, everyone is talking about Giannis. Even though — and I want to underline this — the Bucks continue to tell teams: 'He’s not available. We don’t want your trade pitches.' So, it’s this weird deal where the Bucks keep shouting into the wind: 'Listen to us! We don’t want to talk trades with you about Giannis Antetokounmpo!' And the rest of the league just ignores it and obsesses about him.\"\n\nSince the initial report from ESPN’s Brian Windhorst came out, a plethora of reporting on the matter from other sources has come to light.\n\nESPN's Shams Charania, for example, reported afterward that Antetokounmpo and his camp have started talks with Milwaukee about whether or not Antetokounmpo will stay with the Bucks long-term:\n\nJust in: Giannis Antetokounmpo and his agent Alex Saratsis have started conversations with the Milwaukee Bucks about the two-time NBA MVP's future – and discussing whether his best fit is staying or elsewhere, sources tell ESPN. A resolution is expected in the coming weeks. pic.twitter.com/NfrpL2Ffvr\n\n— Shams Charania (@ShamsCharania) December 3, 2025\n\nESPN also reported that it wouldn’t be New-York-or-bust for Antetokounmpo:\n\nOver the offseason, Antetokounmpo explored external options and was open to playing for one team outside of Milwaukee -- the New York Knicks -- as a potential trade home. Sources described it as an exclusive negotiating window for the Knicks over a multiweek period in August, but that will not be the case moving forward. Multiple other teams would be expected to emerge as suitors for the nine-time All-Star if trades are explored.\n\nDoc Rivers, frustrated with the media and reporting on the matter, then said that Antetokounmpo hadn’t asked for a trade:\n\nDoc Rivers: \"I want to make it clear for the - I want to say one more time - for the 50th time, and clearly it's not getting to one network, for sure, Giannis has never asked to be traded. Ever. I can't make that more clear.\" https://t.co/e6XSo0OuP8\n\n— Eric Nehm (@eric_nehm) December 3, 2025\n\nThe Lakers, Clippers and Heat were also reportedly mentioned as other potential suitors for the former league MVP, though they were waiting until he could hit free agency in 2027.\n\nAnd all of that is just a taste of the huge amount of reporting on the Antetokounmpo trade front over the last week.

But it felt like another night when there were as many questions as answers for a team which has now lost just once in nine games.",

    "fullText": "Six contenders have been shortlisted for the award, which will be presented during the live show on BBC One on Thursday, 18 December.\n\nThe 2024 World Sport Star award was won by Swedish pole vaulter Armand Duplantis.\n\nBelow you can vote for your favourite - and find out more about the contenders.\n\nSpain midfielder Caldentey enjoyed a stellar first season in English football, with her performances instrumental in Arsenal's march to Champions League glory, beating her former club Barcelona in the final.\n\nAfter scoring 19 goals in 41 appearances for the Gunners in her first season, Caldentey was named the Professional Footballers' Association women's player of the year and the Women's Super League player of the year.\n\nCaldentey scored in the Women's Euro 2025 final, which Spain narrowly lost to England on penalties.\n\nThe 29-year-old was runner-up in the Ballon d'Or award, missing out to compatriot Aitana Bonmati, and was also included in Uefa's Champions League team of the year.\n\nThe making of Spain and Arsenal's humble magician\n\nArsenal's Caldentey wins WSL player of year award\n\nSport: Boxing Country: United States\n\nCrawford cemented his status as one of the greatest boxers in history by becoming the first male fighter to be undisputed champion across three weight divisions in the four-belt era.\n\nThe 38-year-old had to go up two weight classes to face the great Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez at super-middleweight, but secured a unanimous decision in front of a fiercely pro-Mexican crowd in Las Vegas.\n\nIn claiming the WBA (Super), WBC, IBF, WBO and The Ring belts, the American extended his professional record to 42 straight victories - the past 20 of which have been world title fights.\n\nHowever, Crawford was stripped of the WBC belt earlier in December, with president Mauricio Sulaiman claiming the American did not pay sanctioning fees.\n\n'Crawford conquers Canelo to become the face of boxing'\n\nHistory-maker Crawford stuns Canelo in Vegas\n\nSport: Athletics Country: Sweden\n\nIn 2025, Sweden's Duplantis once again soared above his rivals to capture a third pole vault World Championship gold.\n\nIn doing so, he set yet another world record of 6.30m - his fourth of this year alone - and the 14th of his remarkable career.\n\nHe also retained his indoor world title - meaning he has won eight successive golds in major global competitions - and won all 16 of his events to become the first male pole vaulter in modern history to go undefeated for two successive years.\n\nIn November, the 26-year-old was named men's world athlete of the year for a third time.\n\nDuplantis gets 14th world record & third world title\n\nThe making of Mondo: How Duplantis is reaching new heights\n\nSport: Athletics Country: United States\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone, the greatest female 400m hurdler of all time, made the switch to the 400m flat at the World Athletics Championships this year, but the result remained the same as she became the first athlete to claim career world titles in both disciplines.\n\nHer time of 47.78 seconds was the second fastest in history and she came close to breaking a world record that has stood since 1985.\n\nThe 26-year-old is undefeated across both distances for two years.\n\nShe added another gold in the 4x400m relay in Tokyo and was named the women's world athlete of the year.\n\nMcLaughlin-Levrone wins 400m gold with second fastest time in history\n\nDuplantis & McLaughlin-Levrone named world athletes of year\n\nOn the LA Dodgers' march towards retaining their World Series title, Japanese superstar Ohtani produced one of the greatest individual performances in Major League Baseball history.\n\nThe rare 'two-way' player, who operates as both a pitcher and a hitter, smashed three home runs and struck out 10 batters against the Milwaukee Brewers.\n\nThat made him the first pitcher since 1942 to hit three home runs in the same game.\n\nThe 31-year-old was named as one of baseball's Most Valuable Players for the third straight year, and the fourth time overall, moving him into second on the all-time list.\n\nOhtani wins fourth Major League MVP award\n\nOhtani rewrites history to send Dodgers to World Series\n\nSalah, the 'Egyptian King', scored 29 Premier League goals and broke a host of records as he helped Liverpool to a record-equalling 20th top-flight title in the 2024-25 season.\n\nHe became the first player to win the Golden Boot, the Playmaker award for most assists and the Premier League player of the season award in the same campaign. He was also named as the PFA men's player of the year for a record third time and collected a third Football Writers' footballer of the year award.\n\nThe 33-year-old became the highest-scoring overseas player in Premier League history, overtaking Sergio Aguero's mark of 184.\n\nSalah has scored five goals in 18 appearances for Liverpool so far this season, and on Saturday said he felt like he had been \"thrown under the bus\" by the club and that his relationship with head coach Arne Slot had broken down.\n\n'The hunger makes me want more' - Salah wins third PFA award",

    "description": "If the Birds can’t beat Las Vegas, what are we even doing here?",
    "fullText": "Looking for some Philadelphia Eagles optimism after the team’s overtime loss to the Los Angeles Chargers?\n\nThe losing streak might soon be coming to an end.\n\nThe Birds host the Las Vegas Raiders in Week 15 and the home team is favored by 11.5 points, according to FanDuel Sportsbook.\n\nFurther, the Eagles’ moneyline is currently -950. That means you’ll need to wager $950 just to win $100. The Raiders’ moneyline is +640, which means you can wager $100 to win $640.\n\nMake no mistake: it’s hard to feel amazing about the Eagles right now. But the Raiders are truly dreadful. Las Vegas has two wins this year and one of them is over the Tennessee Titans. The other was a weird Week 1 win over the New England Patriots.\n\nThe Raiders’ quarterback situation is currently unclear with Geno Smith getting banged up in Week 14. If he can’t play, it’ll seemingly be old friend Kenny Pickett under center. Regardless, the Eagles’ defense should be able to have success against this Raiders offense. Not unlike the Chargers, the Raiders have a terrible offensive line.\n\nWhile it’s impossible to trust the Eagles’ offense to play well, the Raiders’ defense should give them some scoring changes. Only eight teams have allowed more points than Las Vegas has this season. And it seems like Lane Johnson might be returning to the starting lineup, which could help to shut down the Raiders’ best player in Maxx Crosby.\n\nIf the Eagles can’t beat the Raiders, I’m not sure they can win any of their three remaining games after that. I’m taking the Eagles to beat Las Vegas but I can’t be confident it’ll be pretty.",

    "description": "Salah went on a tirade against the Liverpool hierarchy after being benched for a third time in a row",
    "fullText": "Mohamed Salah went on an explosive tirade after Liverpool’s draw with Leeds on Sunday where he took aim at manager Arne Slot and the club’s hierarchy, claiming to have been thrown “under the bus”.\n\nThe Egyptian, who has lost his place in the Liverpool team, said he doesn’t have a relationship with Slot any more as he accused the club of breaking their promises to him.\n\nSalah also called out Liverpool legend-turned-pundit Jamie Carragher and lamented how he has been treated differently to fellow Premier League great Harry Kane.\n\nHere’s every word of Salah’s extraordinary rant at Elland Road.\n\nWhat are you thinking sat on the bench?\n\n“I don't know what to say. It's funny but I couldn't believe it. It is a really disappointing result for us as a team because we expect to win a game like that.\n\n“We managed to score two goals in the beginning and the game was going in our direction but we conceded silly goals. I'm not attacking my teammates because I was on the bench but we conceded silly goals as we did before.\n\n“We just have to try to keep a clean sheet and win games.”\n\n“That I'm sitting on the bench for 90 minutes! The third time on the bench, I think for the first time in my career. I'm very, very disappointed to be fair. I have done so much for this club down the years and especially last season.\n\n“Now I'm sitting on the bench and I don't know why. It seems like the club has thrown me under the bus. That is how I am feeling. I think it is very clear that someone wanted me to get all of the blame.\n\n“I got a lot of promises in the summer and so far I am on the bench for three games so I can't say they keep the promise.\n\n“I said many times before that I had a good relationship with the manager and all of a sudden, we don't have any relationship. I don't know why, but it seems to me, how I see it, that someone doesn't want me in the club.\n\n“This club, I always support it. My kids will always support it. I love the club so much I will always do. I called my mum yesterday - you guys didn't know if I would start or not, but I knew.\n\n“Yesterday I said to them, come to the Brighton game. I don't know if I am going to play or not but I am going to enjoy it. In my heads, I'm going to enjoy that game because I don't know what is going to happen now.\n\n“I will be in Anfield to say goodbye to the fans and go the Africa Cup (of Nations). I don't know what is going to happen when I am there.”\n\nWhat do you do with the situation now?\n\n“It is not acceptable for me. I don't know why this is happening to me. I don't get it. I think if this was somewhere else, every club would protect its player.\n\n“How I see it now is like you throw Mo under the bus because he is the problem in the team now. But I don't think I am the problem. I have done so much for this club.\n\n“The respect, I want to get. I don't have to go every day fighting for my position because I earned it. I am not bigger than anyone but I earned my position. It's football. It is what it is.”\n\nCould Brighton be your last game for Liverpool?\n\n“In football you never know. I don’t accept this situation. I have done so much for this club.”\n\n“With respect, I love everyone. I love (Erling) Haaland, I will talk about him. I am the current top goalscorer in the Premier League. He is not yet. He is going to win it hopefully and that is fine for him. I love him and he knows that.\n\n“I am top goalscorer, best player, winning the league in such a style, but I am the one who has to defend himself in front of the media and fans.”\n\n“Absolutely. After what I have done for the club it really hurts. You can imagine, really. After going from home to the club and you don’t know if you are starting. I know the club too well, I have been here many years. Tomorrow (Jamie) Carragher is going to go for me again and again and that’s fine.”\n\nIs a move to Saudi Arabia still on the table?\n\n“I don’t want to answer this question, because the club is going to take me to a different direction.”\n\nIs the situation now impossible to solve?\n\n“I cannot say it is impossible, but from what I feel, I have done so much for the club, I love the fans and the club so much, but I don’t know what is going to happen next.”\n\nIs it doubly frustrating that you didn’t even come on against Leeds?\n\n“Can you answer that? I have been at this club, scoring more than anyone in this generation, since I came to the Premier League, I don’t think anyone has scored more goals and made more assists than me. In the whole Premier League. If I am somewhere else, everybody would go to the media and defend the players. I am the only one in this situation.\n\n“Can I give an example? It’s silly but I am sorry. I remember a while go, Harry Kane was not scoring for 10 games, everyone in the media was like ‘oh, Harry will score for sure’, when it comes to Mo everyone is like ‘he needs to be on the bench’. I am sorry Harry!”\n\nWhen you talk about someone wanting you out, who is that?\n\n“I don't know. I don't know. I really don’t know.”\n\nIs it the sporting director, Richard Hughes?\n\n“No, no, don't put the words in my mouth. From the situation I see that’s it.”\n\nHad anyone communicated and explained the situation to you? Have you actually asked for that?\n\n“I did. I did, but I don't see an explanation.\n\n“Like I knew yesterday that I was not going to play and that's it, so take it and swallow it and go home.”\n\nWere told personally you weren't going to be playing by Arne Slot?\n\n“Yeah, he told me yesterday and had a meeting with him.”\n\nDid you let your feelings be known then, you were disappointed?\n\n“He knows my feeling. He knows my feeling.”\n\nDo you regret signing that contract?\n\n“Imagine how bad that I have to answer it, honestly.\n\n“That hurts, even the question hurts. This club, signing for this club, I will never regret it.\n\n“I thought I'm going to renew here and end my career here, but this is not according to the plan, so I'm not regretting signing for the club for sure.”\n\nYou're one of the greatest players in Liverpool's history. Can you believe it might end like this?\n\n“Somehow it will end but the thing in my head is like why it should end this way? Because I am too fit, just five months ago I was just winning every individual award so why should it go this direction?\n\n“I'm sorry everybody in a team is not in his form yet I'm the one has has to defend himself now.”\n\nIs the next step for you to speak to Slot again?\n\n“No, I don’t think so. We spoke a lot.”\n\nHas the relationship broken down?\n\n“Yeah, there's no relationship between us.\n\n“It was very good relationship and now all of a sudden there is no relationship.”\n\nHas something changed behind the scenes?\n\n“You guys know better than me. I don't know.”\n\nDo you feel let down from your team-mates as well?\n\n“No, no, no, these guys, they know how much I love them. They know how much I support them, even inside before the game, after the game.\n\n“I'm an experienced player, I've been in their position. I always support them, I always give them experience. But no, no, the players they're not connected to the situation at.\n\n“Even they support me so much so there's just much love between us as players and respect.”",

    "description": "The Philadelphia Eagles hardly resemble the team that won Super Bowl 59 just 10 months ago. A third-consecutive loss dropped Philadelphia to 8-5.",
    "fullText": "INGLEWOOD, CA — Jalen Hurts and DeVonta Smith sat quietly next to each other in a somber postgame locker room after a 22-19 overtime loss to the Los Angeles Chargers.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles hardly resemble the team that won Super Bowl 59 just 10 months ago. A third consecutive loss dropped Philadelphia to 8-5.\n\n“We have won a lot of football games. Right now, we've lost three in a row,” Eagles coach Nick Sirianni said. “I'm confident in the coaches that we have, the players that we have, the owner that we have, the front office that we have. We're built to overcome, and we know how to do that.”\n\nSirianni confirmed reports that he had taken more of a hands-on approach with the Eagles offense in preparation for Monday night.\n\nSaquon Barkley did top 100 rushing yards for the second time this season, but the offense was once again mostly lethargic. It’s tough to glean confidence from this version of the Eagles' offense.\n\nThe Eagles haven’t scored more than 21 points in a game since October. Philadelphia came into Week 14 with the 23rd-ranked passing attack and 22nd-ranked rushing offense in the league.\n\nHurts tossed a career-worst four interceptions versus the Chargers and produced a nightmare five total turnovers in the overtime defeat.\n\n“I have to find ways to lead our team to victories,” Hurts said. “That’s not something that’s foreign to us. We are just not able to do it at the moment. That starts with me and how I play, how I lead and how I go out there and do my job. When I look at it at any point, it’s about how I respond to a test. And what level of resilience and resolve I have to push forward and figure things out.”\n\nThe Eagles are slightly in front of the Dallas Cowboys (6-6-1) for the NFC East lead with four regular-season games remaining. The Eagles’ three-game losing streak is reminiscent of the team’s 2023 collapse, during which they lost five of their last six regular-season games and made a quick exit in the postseason.\n\nYet, the silver lining is this Eagles club, despite some injuries, brought back 10 offensive starters from the Super Bowl-winning squad. Standout tackle Lane Johnson is expected to return this season. Three of their next four opponents have losing records. They control their own destiny.\n\n“You always have to look inward and be honest with yourself, first and foremost. Take accountability and learn to fix it as quickly as possible,” Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown said. “That’s what we plan to do. That’s what I plan to do.”\n\nBrown is correct. The Eagles' offense must “quickly” find a way to turn things around or else the season will expire quickly akin to the 2023 squad.\n\n“A game like that definitely stings. But we can use this to either start pointing fingers and get upset, or we can make sure that doesn't break us and we come together and we just keep rolling. And I think we're going to take that side of it,” Barkley said. “Everything that we want is still in front of us. That's the beauty of football. That's the beauty of having success early in the season. And now we got to get things rolling.”\n\nFollow USA TODAY Sports' Tyler Dragon on X @TheTylerDragon.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Eagles in danger of another late-season collapse after latest setback",

    "fullText": "Bayern Munich’s rip-roaring start to the 2025/26 campaign, on all fronts, seems to be sputtering just a little bit. A 5-0 smashing of VfB Stuttgart showed they have as much explosion in them as ever, but it follows a draw in the Bundesliga to Union Berlin, a bitter Champions League defeat to Arsenal, and another narrow scrape against Union in a DFB-Pokal win. The distance to the finish line of the first half of the season: so close, yet so far, and the last few matches will be a slog.\n\nAt least there is the Winterpause. The Christmas holidays will bring a period of rest and rejuvenation for the weary Bayern squad, and it is something new for Bayern’s Premier League-seasoned coach, Vincent Kompany.\n\n“I spent 11 years in England, and there Christmas was almost always synonymous with football,” Kompany explained in comments captured by @iMiaSanMia. “Now, in Germany, I can experience this holiday like a 12-year-old again — without any distractions, completely with my family. I really enjoy that.”\n\nWith pressure mounting, match fatigue setting in, and key injury returns just around the corner, this year’s holiday season could hardly come at a better time.

    "fullText": "Manchester United midfielder Kobbie Mainoo has struggled for game time this season.\n\nMainoo has had to adapt to a significantly reduced role during Ruben Amorim’s time as manager at the club.\n\nThe England international was an automatic starter for Erik ten Hag but has fallen down the pecking order at Old Trafford. Bruno Fernandes and Casemiro are very much Amorim’s first-choice midfield pairing, and Mainoo’s game time is not helped by the lack of European football this season for the Red Devils.\n\nMainoo has played in 10 Premier League matches this season but has failed to earn a single start. Moreover, he has played just 183 minutes of action during that time.\n\nHe also failed to get off the bench last Thursday against West Ham United at Old Trafford.\n\nAs a result, Mainoo has been heavily linked with a move away from the club this winter.\n\nThe young midfielder is said to be interested in a loan move to SSC Napoli, where he would join up with former teammates Scott McTominay and Rasmus Hojlund.\n\nThere have also been reports of other big European teams such as Chelsea and Bayern Munich taking an interest in the 21-year-old.\n\nTwo former Manchester United academy graduates, Paul Scholes and Nicky Butt, have expressed their sympathy for Mainoo’s current situation.\n\nSpeaking on The Good, The Bad & The Football podcast, Scholes argued, “Ruben Amorim has said Kobbie Mainoo is a starter… every appearance he’s made in the Premier League has been as a sub. Things like that wind me up. I wouldn’t mind if he was in a good team and they were winning every week and keeping possession but they’re rubbish.”\n\nHe continued, “Kobbie is a 20-year-old kid and he’s not playing, he’s going to have to leave. Do you know what will happen now? Amorim will bring him into a game and he won’t be great but that’s because he needs regular games.”\n\nScholes also theorised that Mainoo is outperforming Casemiro in training but is still not getting a look in.\n\nButt wholeheartedly agreed and asserted, “the Kobbie one is an absolute joke. I went to the West Ham game [a 1-1 draw at Old Trafford] and it was an absolute s***show. It was a terrible, boring game. The player to bring on to change the game, in my opinion, was Kobbie Mainoo – but he didn’t get on the pitch. He’ll be another homegrown player who leaves and is a superstar somewhere else.”\n\nThe former midfielder also claimed that were Mainoo playing for another Premier League team, United would be keen to snap him up for £70m or £80 million.\n\nButt concluded, “he’s a top, top, top player that we are f****** up. Kobbie has got to go. If I’m looking after him I’m telling him ‘we’re getting you out of that football club’.\n\nThe former Head of the Academy claimed that it would be “embarrassing” if he went to Chelsea but that he could certainly see Mainoo moving to Stamford Bridge in the near future.\n\nFeatured image Shaun Botterill via Getty Images\n\nThe Peoples Person has been one of the world’s leading Man United news sites for over a decade. bsky.social",

    "fullText": "Recent claims emerging from Italy, as echoed by Mundo Deportivo, have sparked intense debate, with reports suggesting a dramatic twist in Robert Lewandowski’s future at Barcelona.\n\nAccording to these updates, AC Milan are exploring the possibility of a sensational January swap deal involving Christopher Nkunku and the Polish striker, a proposal that would rank among the most unexpected moves of the winter window.\n\nLewandowski’s situation at Barcelona has been subject to growing scrutiny in recent weeks.\n\nWith his contract entering its final stretch and the club quietly preparing for life beyond one of Europe’s most prolific forwards, the sense of uncertainty around him has only intensified.\n\nHis age and the financial weight of a potential renewal make his long-term continuity increasingly unlikely, leaving Barcelona in a position where securing a replacement appears not only necessary but far more feasible than before.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, Milan’s interest comes into sharp focus.\n\nAC Milan are ready to offer Christopher Nkunku. (Photo by Alessandro Sabattini/Getty Images)\n\nThe Italian giants are reportedly considering bringing Lewandowski long before his contract expires, rather than waiting for the opportunity to sign him as a free agent in 2026.\n\nTo strengthen their case, the Serie A club is said to be willing to include Nkunku in an exchange deal, a move that would give Barcelona an instant, high-profile attacking reinforcement.\n\nInitial reports suggested Milan were preparing to hold talks with agent Pini Zahavi, who represents both Lewandowski and Nkunku, to explore whether such a transfer could gain momentum.\n\nHowever, sources close to the Barcelona striker have firmly denied that any such meeting has been scheduled, signalling that the situation may be far less advanced than the Italian whispers imply.\n\nStill, the dynamics within Barcelona cannot be ignored, as Lewandowski’s decreasing influence, combined with Ferran Torres’ growing prominence, is putting the Pole in a difficult spot.\n\nFrom Milan’s perspective, this shift only strengthens the logic behind attempting an opportunistic move.",

Places are fought for game after game and if the manager thinks you aren't pulling your weight you are dropped. In my opinion Salah should be sold in January before he upsets the squad more than it is already.\n\nAndrew: It's the right call, he's not bigger than the club and appears past his best on form this season. Others could equally be dropped for a game or two, but with no centre half options selling Salah and bringing in Guehi is a must.\n\nJohn: Salah is out of order and out of form so Slot and Liverpool were right to drop him. All he should be doing instead of sulking is working hard to get his place back.\n\nHeidi: Not the Liverpool way. Set an example and find that spark when your form is dipping. Torching your legacy to play in the Saudi Pro League? Fine, the very deserving Ian Rush and Roger Hunt get to keep their well-earned goal records.\n\nKeith: Salah can't complain, he did this to himself. Not content with the pain Liverpool fans are enduring in results, he chose to add an embarrassing sideshow to the mix.\n\nStephen: Saddened, this stuff needs to be kept in-house but he knows that. No person is bigger than LFC. He himself must know his form has dropped off a cliff this season. He should apologise publicly for the outburst. Does he really want to play in the Saudi league now? I 'd be very surprised to see any interest from elsewhere? He needs to think very carefully about what he's done and the consequences. Mo, you're bigger and better than that - you and your agent know it and so does everybody else.\n\nJohn: It's probably the right call, leaving the door slightly ajar for Salah to come up with a public apology, to fans, team mates, Slot and the club. He's miscalculated big time and without a full retraction he's almost certainly played his last game for the Reds. It would be a sad end to a glittering Liverpool career.\n\nPaul: I love Mo, like every other Liverpool fan. But he needs to be gone after the Afcon for this behaviour. Otherwise it will lead to the same player power shambles that Man Utd have experienced the last few years. If he comes back into the fold after this then players present and future will think they can get away with being entitled at LFC.\n\nAJC: A pointless and untimely tantrum. Slot is looking for solutions and in this moment he's experimenting on what we are like using alternatives on the right. Salah is off to the Afcon shortly. Makes sense to me. Stop sulking Mo.",

    "fullText": "Legendary Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher had this to say when discussing Mohamed Salah on Sky Sports' Monday Night Football:\n\n\"I thought it was a disgrace what he did after the game. Some people have painted it as an emotional outburst. I don't think it was.\n\n\"I think whenever Mo Salah stops in a mixed zone, which he's done four times in eight years at Liverpool, it's choreographed with him and his agent to cause maximum damage and strengthen his own position.\n\n\"He did that 12 months ago and I called him out about it. He played on the heartstrings of Liverpool supporters. Liverpool were top of league, he'd just scored the winning goal at Southampton and that was time to come out and put pressure on the Liverpool ownership.\n\n\"For the rest of the season you had banners in the crowd saying 'Give Mo his dough'.\n\n\"He's chosen this weekend to do this now and has waited for a bad result for Liverpool, when the supporters and everyone involved in club feels like they are in the gutter. He's chose that time to go for the manager and maybe he's trying to to get him sacked.\n\n\"That's the way I felt about it.\n\n\"The 'thrown under the bus' line stands out to me. He's tried to do that to the club twice in the last 12 months.\n\n\"He's going after owners initially who have paid him hundreds of thousands of pounds over the last six years and complained he's not got a huge contract at the age of 32 when they're more than entitled to do that.\n\n\"With the manager right now, he should be trying to do as much as possible to get the club out of their worst run since the 1950s and hasn't done that.\n\n\"I want to remind Salah and his agent that before he came to Liverpool he was known as the guy who failed at Chelsea. He had never won a major trophy.\n\n\"He is also the greatest player his country has ever had. Egypt in Afcon are the most successful nation but Salah has never won Afcon.\n\n\"This is not me trying to put Salah down - he is one of best players in the world.\n\n\"But it tells Salah and his agent it is not about an individual. He wasn't a big star before he came to Liverpool and he has not won anything with Egypt.\n\n\"You need help from team-mates, managers and fans. It is really important he remembers that.\n\n\"In the mixed zone, all he's about is me, me, me.\"",

(Photo by David Ramos/Getty Images)\n\nBarcelona have acted by immediately cancelling all offending tickets and have confirmed that once the full list of violations is finalised, each case will be sent to the Disciplinary Committee.\n\nGiven the encounter’s ‘High Risk’ status, the institution has activated enhanced security protocols.\n\nThe club is urging any individuals without valid tickets to avoid travelling to the stadium, stressing that there will be no ticket windows open on matchday.\n\nAuthorities are also implementing strict controls on rival supporters, as German team colours, symbols and apparel may only be worn within the designated away sector.\n\nThe Anti-Violence Commission’s guidelines have also been fully applied. These include nominative tickets, a complete ban on away-fan activities within home-supporter zones and blocking online purchases from foreign IP addresses.\n\nBarcelona’s position is uncompromising, and understandably, they are safeguarding the integrity of this important fixture.",

    "title": "When Good /Bins Go Bad: Remote Pre-Authentication Overflow in LLDB's Debugserver",
    "description": "A Remote Pre-Authentication Overflow in LLDB's debugserver",
    "fullText": "In this guest blog post, Nathaniel Oh details a recent bug he discovered and reported to Apple — a remote pre-authentication buffer overflow in LLDB’s debugserver, now patched as CVE-2025-43504.\n\nGrowing up, I always enjoyed digging through the DVD bins at my local Walmart. I noticed a lot of the same movies were left on top, but if you actually dug in, you’d find more interesting and niche titles.\n\nWhen a program overflows a buffer, you’re essentially reaching into its bargain bin. Depending on how far you reach, the DVDs - or in this case, the overwritten structures in memory - can change.\n\nToday’s bargain /bin is CVE-2025-43504: A remote pre-authentication global buffer overflow I found in LLDB’s debugserver.\n\nDuring application development, developers often find the need to debug their app on a physical iOS device. To accomplish this, Xcode mounts a Developer Disk Image on the target iPhone and then pairs with it.\n\nOnce paired, the macOS host is able to communicate with the iOS client using the debugserver installed onto the client. Now any client that can establish a GDB-remote session to the device’s debugserver can reach the qSpeedTest handler and overflow the vulnerable buffer.\n\nLet’s take a look at the Xcode 26.1 security release page to better understand how Apple categorized CVE-2025-43504:\n\nDue to modern-day software mitigations, Apple considers buffer overflows to primarily be a denial-of-service issue rather than a corruption primitive. As we will explore today, this is generally true as an attacker will need to overcome several hurdles and likely pair this issue with another bug to achieve arbitrary code execution.\n\nIf you would like to experiment with a pre-patched version of debugserver, use the following commit or any commits prior to ac8e7be5fbd11f731ffc81bf3bbae50a5a4d83de:\n\nBefore the patch in RNBRemote.cpp, any remote user who could connect to an iOS device’s debugserver could send a pre-authentication qSpeedTest packet to RNBRemote::HandlePacket_qSpeedTest and corrupt adjacent structures in the global data segment of debugserver.\n\nHowever, there’s an important caveat: we only control the length of the corruption. The contents of the payload are fixed to a stream of 'a' characters. While students may enjoy the consistently high marks, the practical utility of this overflow is greatly limited by the fact that we can’t control the actual bytes being written-only how far the flood of 'a's goes.\n\nNow, let’s take a look under the hood of RNBRemote::HandlePacket_qSpeedTest to see exactly what is going on:\n\nThe role of RNBRemote::HandlePacket_qSpeedTest() is to process incoming qSpeedTest:response_size:<hex>; packets without requiring authentication from a remote user who can communicate to the iOS device’s debugserver binary.\n\nHowever, once a remote user is able to send a qSpeedTest:response_size:<hex>; packet to debugserver, no authentication checks occur within debugserver prior to processing the user-supplied response_size. Therefore, any user who can communicate with an iOS device mounted with a Developer Disk Image is able to overflow debugserver via a qSpeedTest:response_size:<hex>; packet.\n\nNow that we’ve reached the vulnerable function RNBRemote::HandlePacket_qSpeedTest(), let’s examine exactly how the overflow occurs. First, the user-supplied size <hex> in the qSpeedTest:response_size:<hex>; packet is extracted and stored in the variable response_size:\n\nIf parsing succeeds and the next character is a semicolon, a function‑local static 4 MiB + 16‑byte buffer g_data is initialized and seeded with the ASCII header \"data:\":\n\nPutting it all together, memset then fills the static 4 MiB + 16‑byte buffer g_data with 'a' using the user-controlled response_size value as the number of 'a's to use.\n\nTherefore, whenever a remote LLDB client sends a qSpeedTest:response_size:<hex>; packet with a response_size greater than the 4 MiB + 16‑byte buffer, a buffer overflow occurs and corrupts adjacent global variables stored in the global data segment (.bss) of debugserver.\n\nNow that we understand the architecture behind the overflow, let’s now dive into the actual mechanics of the vulnerability. To start things off, let’s use the following Python program to explore the corruption primitives gained through the g_data overflow:\n\nAfter launching debugserver, we run the following python3 command and provide the response_size of 4004AB:\n\nWe notice that debugserver does not crash and returns as normal:\n\nWhile we are technically out-of-bounds, g_data is terminated with a \\0 byte, so the neighboring logging function pointer g_log_callback is only overridden by a NULL byte, keeping the entire pointer NULL.\n\nAfter launching debugserver, we run the following python3 command and provide the response_size of 0x4004AC:\n\nAs we can see, we now control the value of g_log_callback. Well, partially, we really only control how many bytes in g_log_callback would be equal to 0x61.\n\nWe can see this occur in _DNBLogVAPrintf:\n\nSince g_log_callback is non-NULL, the mutex is locked and proceeds to call our corrupted pointer and crashes. Now, after a response_size of 0x4004B3, we stop seeing any real change to the crash address or the corresponding stack trace until after a 0x7F offset is added to response_size. Logically, this makes sense, because once the g_log_callback pointer becomes corrupted, any follow-on corruption within other logging structures become irrelevant due to the initial crash by dereferencing g_log_callback.\n\nInterestingly, on a production release of macOS prior to the patch, I was able to use this partial pointer control to overwrite various user-space pointers in memory:\n\nFor some reason, the trailing byte of each address was always incremented by 0x8 bytes. However, if we were able to solve the alignment issue created by the terminating 0x6169 bytes, and were somehow able to predict and control the data dereferenced by the overwritten pointer, we would theoretically be able to redirect the control flow and eventually gain code execution.\n\nWe briefly discussed the mutex locking prior to dereferencing the corrupted g_log_callback pointer. Now, at the response_size of 0x40052C, the actual mutex itself becomes corrupted:\n\nWe notice that the issue appeared when _DNBLogVAPrintf ran the lock_guard construction:\n\nBased on the stack trace, we see that lock_guard faults when __m_.lock is called:\n\nExamining further, let’s take a look at the function definition of std::recursive_mutex:\n\nIt appears to be a wrapper for __libcpp_recursive_mutex_lock:\n\nWhich then in-turn appears to be a wrapper for pthread_mutex_lock:\n\nWhich is another wrapper for _pthread_mutex_lock… But we don’t need to go that far.\n\nBecause the pthread_mutex_t pointer is corrupted by our overflow, pthread_mutex_lock throws std::system_error(\"recursive_mutex lock failed\") and the program then throws an abort() and terminates.\n\nDue to the program abort, exploitation of the response_size between 0x40052C and 0x402C62 is significantly more challenging since we are corrupting a synchronization primitive given the additional checks performed by macOS.\n\nNow, when we use a response_size of 0x402C63 or greater, the CPU faults in RNBRemote::HandlePacket_qSpeedTest as soon as memset crosses the boundary into whatever guard page or unmapped region the kernel placed after the .bss segment in memory:\n\nThis final overflow variant isn’t as interesting as there is no straight-forward way to controlling program execution.\n\nNow that we’ve covered the issue itself, let’s examine how Apple patched it:\n\nAccording to the patch description,\n\nChange this allocation to be on heap, and impose a maximum size that can\nbe tested (4MB, for now).\n\nGiven the extensive closed-source ecosystem behind Apple’s software and systems, it’s always a challenge to reliably discover and understand software defects.\n\nHowever, there are always open-source dependencies that Apple relies on, and if you can find an issue in one of them, chances are there may be effects felt downstream.\n\nGood luck hunting and be sure to responsibly disclose any issues you may find 😉",

    "description": "What remains if/when coding is ‘solved’",
    "fullText": "It’s hard not to think about the direction the software engineering field is\ngoing in. I don’t think you, dear reader, need to be reminded of this, but just\nto set up some timeline tentpoles:\n\nIn late 2024, I remember having a bit of the feeling of being “the weird one” at\nwork, who tried to offload as much of my coding on LLMs as possible. I developed\na bit of a reputation for this, and throughout 2025 I’d have people\nspontaneously ask me in 1:1s if I’d found any new techniques or tips for getting\nbetter performance out of AI coding tools.\n\nThese tools are excellent. They’re also, descriptively, somewhat of an\ninevitability. The tools exist, they are getting better month-over-month, there\nare market forces pushing for their adoption, for the time being there is\nimmense comparative advantage in being able to wield them effectively; ignoring\nthem seems increasingly unwise.\n\nThroughout 2025, I felt more and more that I was able to offload much of the\nimplementation of my work to coding agents. I’m a Tech Lead, so my time is split\nbetween meetings, more meetings, writing docs, and preciously guarded IC time.\nOffloading more to coding agents increased my effective output, as I could fire\noff an agent (or 2, or 3) before a meeting, check their work afterwards, and\nguide them towards solutions over the course of my day.\n\nThis wasn’t “merely” greenfield work, either. Much of this was changes to old,\ncomplex, mission critical codebases. I reviewed the output with an appropriate\namount of rigor, and became increasingly impressed.\n\nLook, I don’t want to sound like I’m an Anthropic marketer, but if you look at\nthis “”chart”” from the February 24\nrelease of Claude Sonnet 3.7\nand Claude Code, I think they landed their roadmap for this year.\n\nClaude Code – the others too, but in particular CC for me – feels and acts\nlike a collaborator at this point. In the first half of the year, it felt like a\nreasonably competent intern; in the latter half, it’s a jagged-but-staggeringly\ncompetent junior engineer who you can sometimes coach into writing legitimately\ninspired code with a simple “but how would a senior engineer refactor this for\nmodularity and maintainability?”\n\nAll that to say: with the release of Opus 4.5, I sense a shift. I find no\npleasure in saying this. Most of what we call coding is now “solved”. I\ndon’t think, however, that we’re post “software engineer”. I don’t think we are\nin any way\n“post-software”.\nI expect the amount of software being written to dramatically increase as the\ncost to produce it falls. I also believe that we will still need deeply\ntechnical people to guide that production, and develop and maintain the\ninfrastructure to run it.\n\nAnd yet: We are nearly at coder-equivalency for economically useful coding. A\nsufficiently experienced software engineer can now write >90% of\nproduction-ready code purely through prompting. You still largely need to know\nwhat to prompt, but even that becomes easier as models’ intuitions for\nsoftware development improve.\n\nI was admittedly skeptical at Dario Amodei’s\nMarch 2025 claim\nthat this would happen within the year; it happened a few months later than his\ntimeline, but in my opinion it did happen. The obvious corollary is that, for\nnow, that remaining 10% becomes extremely valuable.\n\nThe industry, collectively, has had less than a year to respond to this.\nRegardless of what various leadership-class people say, this is not yet priced\nin. It’s not priced in to e.g. CS university program structure, engineering\nladders, company structure, team structure, and so on.\n\nTo think through what may remain, I’ll attempt to defer to history.\n\nThere’s an analogy that’s been bouncing around in my head as I’ve been\nprocessing what appears to be this upcoming shift in software production. It\ngoes something like this: in the mid-1900s, drafters – those who would\nliterally draft engineering diagrams for architects, civil engineers, electrical\nengineers, mechanical engineers, and so on, were in relatively high demand. As\nwere human computers.\n\nAutomation came for these fields. CAD, and AutoCAD in particular in the early\n1980s, automated much of engineering drafting. Not all, but a lot of it.\nAutomated circuit design via Electronic Design Automation automated much of the\nmanual work done to create PCBs. And, of course, human computers, well…\nyeah.\n\nI tried getting actual labor statistics for this. For the time period I most\ncared about (between 1940 and 2000), the data online was spotty for the amount\nof effort I was willing to put into this.2\n\nIn any case, this seems like a compelling analog for one future of software\nengineering. Drafters were a distinct role, separate from e.g. a mechanical\nengineer or structural engineer. Software “engineering” has a bit of both; it\nencompasses design, production (coding), and maintenance (DevOps, woo…).\n\nCAD and EDA didn’t destroy drafting and related technical-but-not-engineering\nroles. CAD technician jobs still exist today, but it’s a more commoditized skill\nthan “pure” engineering. If this analogy holds, then the parts of the software\nengineering world that looked more like “software drafters” than\n“deep-in-the-design engineers” will largely be commoditized and will shrink.\n\nIt’s unclear what chunk of the existing SWE ecosystem is drafters. I think\nmost people that get into SWE for enjoyment of the field probably aren’t in this\ncategory, but it’s definitely out there.\n\nIf I was able to offload all my coding work on an AI, there still does seem\nlike a lot left to do as a software engineer. Great! I don’t have to code\nanymore. Ah, wait – still have to figure out how to get all the infrastructure\nrunning to build out my new project, keep the lights on for the dozens of\ncomponents we already have in flight, reason through observability, debug wicked\nweirdness that happens past the 99th percentile tails, review my agents’ and my\ncoworkers’ code, write designs, review designs, give career coaching, and on and\non.\n\nCoding also isn’t completely “solved” yet either! I may not be in the mud\nwriting thousands of lines of code, but I do still exert significant editorial\ncontrol over everything that gets checked-in.\n\nAI helps with a lot of this. I feel like I have a lot more leverage than I had a\nyear or two ago, but we’re still pretty far from closing the loop entirely.\nAI-assisted debugging, great! AI-assisted responses in the internal help channel\nfor what my team owns, great! AI-assisted first passes at design docs I’ve\nwritten, great! AI-assisted code review, great!\n\nI notice that my work days still contain many hours, I still remain busy, much\nwork remains to be done. Infrastructure remains hard. If anything, all this\nhas just allowed us to do more and be more ambitious. Systems rely on momentum\nand inertia in part because it requires a ton of time and effort to evolve a\ncomplex system. Reducing the time to build new systems or evolve old ones is\nlegitimately helpful, but human-used systems still operate on human-driven time\nscales – for now.\n\nAt all the companies I’ve worked with, “produces high quality code artifacts”\nwas always a bullet point on the SWE ladder, but it was but one of a dozen other\nskills and responsibilities that come along with the role. In the immediate\nfuture, I don’t see this expectation going away. In the medium term, I could see\nthis transitioning away from a focus on artifacts, to a focus on impact – as\nwas already the expectation for more senior engineers.\n\nI predict agency & impact will become more\nof an expectation for junior engineers, since the tools for helping yourself\nhave become so powerful.\n\nThere is a lot going on in AI as we end 2025. I\nhave grown to dislike the phrase\n“these are the worst the models will ever be”\nbecause I feel like it tries to prove too much and has been co-opted as\nmarketing. But adopt that frame for a minute and project a year or two forward\nto where things could go. What skills remain valuable? What deep knowledge do\nyou still need to draw upon to know if you’re being BS’d by a confused coding\nagent? What can you learn now, build now (experientially!), given that the cost\nto churn out new quality code is falling to zero? What cognitive work can you\nreinvest your time in, if coding demands less of your work day? What types of\npeople are going to be good leaders in times of industry change, like these?\nWhat type of organization do you want to invest your career capital in?\n\nObligatory: These are my own opinions and do not reflect those of my employer,\netc.\n\nThey seemed to me like breakthroughs in non-coding abilities as well, which\nis legitimately impressive as neither of them is specialized as a coding\nmodel. ↩︎\n\nEpistemic status: Vibe check.\nOne source\nput the number of drafters in 1940 at 111k, up from 98k in 1930 and 66k\nin 1920. Confusingly, this\nBLS paper seems to only\nindicate there were ~55k drafters in 1990 (though their counting mechanism\nis unclear). This\nSt. Louis Fed\nreport indicates 200k drafters in 2000 and 193k in 2023. To make meaningful\ncomparisons, we’d have to correct for population growth, definitional shift,\nand so on. Squinting at the numbers, it seems like post-2000 there has been\na slight decline in drafting employment, definitely compared to the rest of\nthe economy. ↩︎",

    "title": "ICEBlock Was Purged from the App Store. Now Its Creator Is Suing Trump",
    "description": "It became a lightning rod for the right—and a target for what its developer says was an attack on free speech.",
    "fullText": "In May, I published an early report on ICEBlock, the iOS-exclusive app that allows you to anonymously notify other users of the presence of Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers within 5 miles of your location. Since then, the app has been on a wild journey. A June CNN segment on ICEBlock and its coder, Joshua Aaron, got the attention of Attorney General Pam Bondi, who told Sean Hannity that Aaron should “watch out”; the app subsequently topped the charts at Apple’s App Store, as Republicans demanded that Bondi investigate Aaron’s creation. Trump whisperer Laura Loomer also got involved, revealing the identity of Aaron’s wife and getting her fired from her job with the Justice Department. The simultaneous trends of liberal uptake and conservative outrage continued until Oct. 2—when Bondi directly instructed Apple to remove ICEBlock from the App Store.\n\nNot only did the Big Tech giant comply, but it also removed other apps with similar ICE-notification and -documentation functions, to the protests of myriad Americans. (Google’s Play Store, which never hosted ICEBlock, also followed suit with those other, similar apps.) By the time it was delisted, Aaron tells me, ICEBlock had “over 1.14 million users,” and it was “adding 15,000 to 20,000 a day.”\n\nYet while ICEBlock got blocked, it may not stay that way much longer.\n\nOn Monday, Aaron filed a federal lawsuit against Bondi and three other Trump administration officials, including White House “border czar” Tom Homan, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, accusing them of violating the First Amendment by coercing a private entity to censor speech and threatening prosecution over the exercise of protected speech. The 39-page suit, which requests a jury trial, asks the D.C. court to bar the Trump administration from demanding that Apple delist ICEBlock, or any similar immigration-advocacy app, ever again. The filing also requests relief on behalf of Aaron himself and his ALL U Chart company, which formally owns ICEBlock. The two plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from Sher Tremonte, the law firm that recently won a federal court judgment ruling Secretary of State Marco Rubio’s efforts to detain and deport pro-Palestine student protesters to be unconstitutional free speech violations.\n\n“We’re seeking a declaratory judgment that this kind of coercion and the threats of prosecution against Joshua violate the First Amendment,” Sher Tremonte lead counsel Noam Biale told me. “And we are seeking an injunction from the court to prevent the government officials whom we’re suing from doing those things again.”\n\nNo one will know for a while yet whether the district court will even take the case up. Assuming it does, Aaron says, “the biggest goal here is to set a precedent”—to get the sort of judgment that could apply to ICEBlock and to the other ICE-related apps that have been taken down at the request of the feds. (Aaron adds, however, that he doesn’t plan to have other plaintiffs join his suit for now.)\n\nDespite the popularity of platforms like the ICE video archive Eyes Up and the interactive crowdsourced map People Over Papers, it does seem that ICEBlock remains the central symbol of this digital movement. Just this Friday, the House Committee on Homeland Security sent letters to the CEOs of Apple and Google, accusing them of still hosting “apps that allow users to report and disseminate data to reveal the location and identification of DHS law enforcement.” By way of erroneous example, the letter exclusively mentions ICEBlock, which does not collect or display anybody’s identity. But to the committee, that app has a special notoriety.\n\n“As you are aware … ICEBlock was used by a gunman to track the movement of ICE agents prior to a deadly shooting in September at an ICE facility in Dallas,” the lawmakers write, pointing to the incident where a 29-year-old Oklahoman purportedly wished to attack ICE agents but ended up killing two detainees and himself.\n\nTo be clear, there was no evidence that the shooter used ICEBlock at any point; FBI Director Kash Patel tweeted after the incident that the gunman had “searched for apps that tracked the presence of ICE agents,” per USA Today. That pretext then inspired Bondi to again call out the media-famous ICEBlock in particular and get Apple to take it down. At the time, Apple told Fox Digital that “information we’ve received from law enforcement about the safety risks associated with ICEBlock” spurred the company to delist the app. The newsletter Migrant Insider later reported, citing “internal correspondence” Apple had sent to a different developer, that App Store moderators now treated federal officers as a “targeted group” on par with typically recognized marginalized ethnicities and identities (race, sexual orientation, origin), using that justification to deplatform apps with “location information … that can be used to harm” ICE agents.\n\nThat takedown alert was addressed to Deicer, a tool that “provides real-time alerts about ICE sightings through community reports, giving users the option to be an ‘observer’ and keep an eye out for authorities,” according to Syracuse University’s Daily Orange. But the same App Store guideline about “targeted groups” had already been weaponized against ICEBlock, per the lawsuit—and this was how “the first known instance of Apple removing U.S.-based apps in response to U.S. government demands” came about. (That being said, public means of tracking airplanes used by ICE are still available.)\n\n“Nothing had changed about ICEBlock, after all that vetting from their legal team over that five-week period of time” before it first hit the App Store, as Aaron told me. “They didn’t provide any evidence of law enforcement being targeted. They didn’t give me any information about what specifically they were provided by law enforcement.”\n\nAs Aaron also pointed out, the government’s rhetoric around ICEBlock tends to be either misinformed or disingenuous. Bondi told the Senate that Americans used the app to “post where ICE officers lived” (even though it did not pinpoint agents’ home residences) and claiming the DOJ also “worked with” Google to remove ICEBlock (even though it was never listed on the Play Store). The House committee’s letter to the Big Tech firms cited the Supreme Court’s landmark Brandenburg v. Ohio decision to imply that ICEBlock was not covered by free-speech statutes, as a supposed example of advocacy “directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action,” or likely to do so.\n\nThe lawsuit counters such arguments by pointing out that the app does not upload or store any media or user data, and has time-limit guardrails for reporting. Plus, there’s a disclaimer stating that the app is “not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement.” Whether that will be enough to restore ICEBlock—itself classified as a form of speech in the suit—is yet to be seen.\n\nMeanwhile, for anyone who still has ICEBlock on their phones, the app is still usable, Aaron says. “Yes, I cannot issue updates and you can’t download it again,” he added. “But we want to encourage people to still use it. It’s still just as private and anonymous as it ever was.”",

    "fullText": "Thanks to local bank holidays we had a couple of consecutive extended weekends, which I spent doing a bunch of long overdue chores, including replacing kitchen lights, organizing my office a bit better, and generally ticking off various small tasks that had been piling up for a while.\n\nAmong those there were some hardware upgrades to my 3D printers, the most involved of which was a hotend upgrade to my KP3S Pro, which was a good pretext to experiment further with DaVinci Resolve and the entire process of documenting my projects.\n\nEven if the added complexity of recording video for the most trivial stuff can be a little annoying, the CAD work was fun, and now both my printers use the same BambuLab clone hotends, which saves me a bunch of headaches.\n\nAnother less involved but still useful upgrade was adding Voron style LEDs to the TwoTrees SK1, which makes it much easier to see what’s going on during printing:\n\nI also went on a little side quest regarding transport surfaces for DaVinci Resolve, and it turns out my Korg nanoKontrol Studio works perfectly on the audio/Fairlight page (transport and all) when set to Pro Tools mode (holding down the Scene and (Rewind) buttons on power up).\n\nI was able to use it just fine via Bluetooth after binding it via Audio MIDI Setup, and I can then pick it under Preferences > Control Panels > Audio Console as a HUI controller, but it just doesn’t work in the Edit page for some reason.\n\nAnother side quest entailed trying to improve my typing experience. Since I was having trouble placing my ring and pinky fingers on my TOTEM when typing at speed, I got a cheap, simplified set of KLP Lamé keycaps, and they definitely help with finger placement–my typing speed has improved quite a bit since then.\n\nI am, however, still struggling with the lack of multiple modifier keys when coding and moving windows around with Moom (home row mods just don’t cut it for me) and I am much faster with a standard layout, so I think I will end up building a second custom split keyboard with a more conventional layout…\n\nWith the sharp decrease in daylight, I decided to revamp my office lighting a bit and ordered a cheap LED ceiling light to use as an indirect “sunlight” analogue, pointed at the ceiling atop one of my office bookcases. Visually it works quite well, but my ZigBee mesh doesn’t seem too happy about it:\n\nAI has removed a lot of the fun from my usual coding hobbies, but with a little more time on my hands, I revisited the status quo of local AI image generation and ended up playing a bit with Z-Image.\n\nPerformance on Apple Silicon using MPS or MLX was pretty dismal since the base model would eat up all the RAM on my 36GB MacBook Pro, but I managed to get the quantized GGUF of Z-Image-Turbo to work quite well on my pokey RTX 3060 and have been playing with describing the kind of illustration style I prefer, with pretty reasonable results so far:\n\nComparing this to the state of the art three years ago is indeed a night and day difference, although I’m a bit sad that we’re clearly past the point where you can run interesting and truly useful models on modest hardware.",

    "fullText": "Much ado is being made about AI being the root cause of the current memory price surge, but the reality is a bit more complex than that. While AI workloads do demand significant memory resources, the underlying issues stem from a combination of factors affecting the entire semiconductor industry–the fact that Micron is shutting down Crucial shocked many PC builders, but if you look at all the charts and ponder the situation, you quickly realize that:\n\nPlus there’s an inconvenient truth–most people do not build (or even upgrade) their own PCs anymore, so the market for custom builds is shrinking, which means less competition and higher prices for those who do.\n\nI do find it highly amusing that people find that Apple’s M-series Macs are now in line with the market, especially since this dynamic doesn’t really apply to Apple–remember they fab the RAM directly into their CPUs, so they’re largely immune to discrete component pricing fluctuations.\n\nPlus, of course, Apple can negotiate far better pricing even if they were to buy discrete RAM, given their scale and influence in the market. At best, they would be affected by IP licensing for specific RAM technologies, but that’s a different matter altogether.\n\nWhat I don’t find amusing, though, was that I completely forgot to buy RAM for one of my machines over Black Friday. Good thing that borg was padded out with 128GB two years ago when it was cheaper…",

I just made a new frontend for my main demo repo without any hand-holding, writing integrations, or anything. Just core dagger + bring your own LLM. In a 2 minute video. Most of which is for the sake of the recording\n\nSo im finally coming around on this whole AI thing is the future...Solomon Hykes demo of an agent writing a curl clone in 5 minutes using Dagger is still lingering in my mind...if any of you are curmudgeons like me you might want to watch...\n\nIf you don’t know where to start to create AI agents, you should have a look at Dagger agents. That makes it so easy to build tools that will benefit from AI but as real developer tool.\n\nFew understand the implications of this. This will be absolutely defining\n\nI'm feeling a \"docker moment\" in real time. Even though I didn't know the CI tool, it seems so promising for multiple areas.\n\n@dagger_io experimental AI tooling is really interesting. I just leveraged two separate modules (Strava and Notify). It took me 20 minutes to build the prompt and less than 5 to write the code.\n\nThis is crazy cool! If you have worked with LLMs this is amazing!\n\nall your dagger functions are now available for agents to use. built-in function registry.\n\nThis is nuts. @dagger_io has always had amazing dev exp, but the fact that it lends itself so seamlessly to something like this is endlessly impressive, massive props @solomonstre and the team!\n\nOk, my mind is a little blown right now. I never considered having LLMs accept containers as inputs and then interact with them to accomplish some goal.\n\nThat's why tools like @dagger_io are going to be so powerful!

Dagger we have established our Istanbul Meetup group as of now! ☝️\n\nOne of Dagger Solomon Hykes' newest innovations is to develop a programmable CI/CD engine. 🤖\n\nDagger is a tool that allows you to develop your CI/CD processes with your favorite programming language that you use to develop your software, and to run your CI/CD steps in containers, eliminating remote engine dependency and advancing all your processes in your local environment. 🚀\n\nThe main purpose of this group will be to raise awareness about the Dagger project and to talk about the benefits of this tool for us, you are all invited! 👋\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dMNjdBDP\n\n#dagger #daggercommunity #daggeristanbul\n\nIt's kind of a container-based swiss army knife that can be used for CI operations (reproducible builds, testing, publishing), creating LLM agents, and more. Tons of integrations and open-source modules on the \"Daggerverse\".\n\nWhen @solomonstre drops an open-source Claude Code... ya run with it. \"Toy Programmer\" + added MCP & cursor-rules + an updated version of @zbeyens phenom \"dotai\" repo\n\nThis is so awesome to play with. I just made a new frontend for my main demo repo without any hand-holding, writing integrations, or anything. Just core dagger + bring your own LLM. In a 2 minute video. Most of which is for the sake of the recording\n\nSo im finally coming around on this whole AI thing is the future...Solomon Hykes demo of an agent writing a curl clone in 5 minutes using Dagger is still lingering in my mind...if any of you are curmudgeons like me you might want to watch...\n\nIf you don’t know where to start to create AI agents, you should have a look at Dagger agents. That makes it so easy to build tools that will benefit from AI but as real developer tool.\n\nFew understand the implications of this. This will be absolutely defining\n\nI'm feeling a \"docker moment\" in real time. Even though I didn't know the CI tool, it seems so promising for multiple areas.\n\n@dagger_io experimental AI tooling is really interesting. I just leveraged two separate modules (Strava and Notify). It took me 20 minutes to build the prompt and less than 5 to write the code.\n\nThis is crazy cool! If you have worked with LLMs this is amazing!\n\nall your dagger functions are now available for agents to use. built-in function registry.\n\nThis is nuts. @dagger_io has always had amazing dev exp, but the fact that it lends itself so seamlessly to something like this is endlessly impressive, massive props @solomonstre and the team!\n\nOk, my mind is a little blown right now. I never considered having LLMs accept containers as inputs and then interact with them to accomplish some goal.\n\nThat's why tools like @dagger_io are going to be so powerful! (standardized text interface, multi-language modules and a neatly integrated web GUI over the CLI) Great AI assistant experiences largely depend on well-designed interfaces they can easily leverage.\n\nI think few realize where Dagger sits in the agentic race. I know I didn’t until I was shown. Incredible.\n\nIf you can relate, you need @dagger_io and fast.\n\nIt’ll take time for people to realize the value of @dagger_io but I’m optimistic it’ll reach critical mass and break the vendor locking that many CI providers benefited from for many years.\n\nI just tried to set up a CI pipeline using @dagger_io to compile and test an Elixir project and OMG.

Tons of integrations and open-source modules on the \"Daggerverse\".\n\nWhen @solomonstre drops an open-source Claude Code... ya run with it. \"Toy Programmer\" + added MCP & cursor-rules + an updated version of @zbeyens phenom \"dotai\" repo\n\nThis is so awesome to play with. I just made a new frontend for my main demo repo without any hand-holding, writing integrations, or anything. Just core dagger + bring your own LLM. In a 2 minute video. Most of which is for the sake of the recording\n\nSo im finally coming around on this whole AI thing is the future...Solomon Hykes demo of an agent writing a curl clone in 5 minutes using Dagger is still lingering in my mind...if any of you are curmudgeons like me you might want to watch...\n\nIf you don’t know where to start to create AI agents, you should have a look at Dagger agents. That makes it so easy to build tools that will benefit from AI but as real developer tool.\n\nFew understand the implications of this. This will be absolutely defining\n\nI'm feeling a \"docker moment\" in real time. Even though I didn't know the CI tool, it seems so promising for multiple areas.\n\n@dagger_io experimental AI tooling is really interesting. I just leveraged two separate modules (Strava and Notify). It took me 20 minutes to build the prompt and less than 5 to write the code.\n\nThis is crazy cool! If you have worked with LLMs this is amazing!\n\nall your dagger functions are now available for agents to use. built-in function registry.\n\nThis is nuts. @dagger_io has always had amazing dev exp, but the fact that it lends itself so seamlessly to something like this is endlessly impressive, massive props @solomonstre and the team!\n\nOk, my mind is a little blown right now. I never considered having LLMs accept containers as inputs and then interact with them to accomplish some goal.\n\nThat's why tools like @dagger_io are going to be so powerful! (standardized text interface, multi-language modules and a neatly integrated web GUI over the CLI) Great AI assistant experiences largely depend on well-designed interfaces they can easily leverage.\n\nI think few realize where Dagger sits in the agentic race. I know I didn’t until I was shown. Incredible.\n\nIf you can relate, you need @dagger_io and fast.\n\nIt’ll take time for people to realize the value of @dagger_io but I’m optimistic it’ll reach critical mass and break the vendor locking that many CI providers benefited from for many years.\n\nI just tried to set up a CI pipeline using @dagger_io to compile and test an Elixir project and OMG. The portability is so priceless. Blog post in progress 😀​\n\nMy entire CI/CD pipeline is Dagger and I'd love for dev to be too; still a few changes that need to happen there though.\n\nCo-founder @gokoyeb , deploy apps and databases on high-performance infrastructure around the world. Previously built @scaleway\n\nExcited to hear @solomonstre talking about @dagger_io and Dagger functions. Need to push the @gokoyeb function to the Daggerverse\n\nOpen Source Effectively Accelerates !\n\nIt was great to participate @dagger_io Meetup yesterday, one of the purest form of OSS event: no bullshit, minimal slides, maximum code. @solomonstre might gave away his @KubeCon_ KN magic a bit\n\n🚀 My top pick video from hashtag#KubeCon + hashtag#cloudnative in Paris is out! From integrated environments to innovative approaches, there's something for every science community to keep an eye on. \n\nYOU get to choose what we dive into next! Comment with your preference! \n\nhttps://lnkd.in/d2Xj2DhJ\n\n1️⃣ First up, Kubeflow offers an all-in-one solution for data science workflows on Kubernetes. Check out CERN Computing's experience at the hashtag#cloudnativeAIDay event and the DHL Data & Analytics and their journey to a data science platform.\n\n2️⃣ Impressive NATS.io with a demo by Synadia perfect for applications from hashtag#ai / hashtag#ml on IoT to microservices\n\n3️⃣ Discover Dagger Functions, revolutionizing workflow management for reproducibility and interoperability\n\nPlus, an extra shoutout to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Enduser Research, let's push it together as it should be!\n\nConseiller intégrateur en architecture logicielle (Cloud/DevOps) chez Ministère de la Famille du Québec (MFA)\n\nWhat I also like 👌 about Dagger is that it perfectly aligns with my personal fav quote: \n\n'Localhost is your best cloud provider’ 🔥🚀\n\nhttps://dagger.io\n\nWhat Is Dagger and Why You Might Want to Use It 🧵​\n\nDagger promises to fix our CI/CD once and for all, but what exactly is Dagger?\n\nIs it a GitHub Actions or Jenkins replacement? Or is it a dev tool that augments existing CI/CD providers? Is it a service or a CLI?\n\nJust finished an incredible hands-on session with Saiyam Pathak, Solomon Hykes, and Kyle Penfound on the Kubesimplify channel, diving deep into the powerful tool Dagger. Followed along on my personal computer and learned a ton. Highly recommend checking it out for anyone interested in cutting-edge DevOps! hashtag#Dagger hashtag#DevOps hashtag#Kubesimplify\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/dygitKgn\n\nSenior Software Engineer at Microsoft\n\nI always felt like tools like docker-compose were not the right fit me me. Always required lots of glue to make it work for the things I needed to do.\n\nThis is where @dagger_io shines. Far more programatic, testable, and repeatable.\n\nWe released a new version of our @dagger_io Daggerverse module to bring the Depot ephemeral registry to our bake function. Going to be a game changer for building all your images at once and being able to do things with the containers immediately\n\nhttps://depot.dev/changelog/2024-03-26-depot-daggerverse-1-1-0\n\nDevOps engineer at @rtCamp | loves writing code | Founder of @ksctl_k8s\n\nyou all got me. Taskfile and Makefile now its dagger @SaiyamPathak. 🙃​ Btw nice explanation on dagger. I think its a good tool, used it 1 year ago 😉​ @dagger_io\n\nNothing beats reading a story about Dagger from a real user. Thanks so much to Scott Molinari for sharing your experience :) \nhttps://lnkd.in/d9fQGRg7\n\nexpert at spline reticulation. ⚡ AWS Infinidash MVP ⚡ I ❤️ coding. Work as Senior Software Engineer.\n\nWrapping my head around the new functions thing is going to take a bit. But I've already done nested docker Goreleaser with CGO_ENABLED , angular builds and more with the SDK. So great! Dagger call might take over all my 3 years of mage work once I figure it all out.\n\nsr engineer @saucedopen 🥡 prev: AWS, VMware, Pivotal\n\n@sheldon_hull @dagger_io and @MagefileDotOrg We’re starting to adopt dagger actually loving it so far\n\nFormer Executive Director, OpenDaylight Project, founder VSPP/vCloud @VMware , launched Cilium/Isovalent out of stealth, now helping Solomon grow http://Dagger.io\n\nWhat a WILD morning! @solomonstre‘s keynote seems to have ignited something major, we’ve been swamped all morning here at @KubeCon_!\n\nDevOps.

It was a special moment that I enjoyed very much, I hope you did too. Non-french speakers: watch this after\n\nSr. Kubernetes Specialist SA @AWSCloud | CNCF Ambassador | Kubernetes contributor\n\nJoin me at the first @dagger_io meetup in Raleigh, NC this week. The meetup will start by teaching the basics of Dagger with real-world examples. I'm still in KubeCon mode, looking forward to meeting the DevOps community in person! Check out the event details at https://meetu.ps/e/MWc2l/3Fcx2/i\n\nMom. Software engineer. Author. Java Champion. Docker Captain. Dev Advocate @JFrog\n\nYeah... ok, there are much better foot models out there than me, but I had to show off the @dagger_io gear I brought with me from #KubeCon Chicago! Thanks for these @jpadamspdx - they were perfect for the long flight home after an incredible week at #KubeCon Paris!\n\n@solomonstre surrounded by people at #KubeCon\n\nI built my first Dagger function yesterday with Solomon Hykes, and just got it published up on the daggerverse!\n\nDagger is awesome, and I plan on continuing to find ways to use it. At a high level, dagger lets you use containers as a first-class object in code, and stitch together complex orchestration pipelines using real programming languages instead of bash.\n\nPrimitives like mounting in files/directories, running commands, building and publishing containers, environment variables and secrets are all available, type-safe, and programmable in Go, Python, or Typescript.\n\nDagger functions let you build abstractions and methods on top of these basic primitives that can then be exposed and reused by other Dagger functions. The entire experience is encapsulated by the `dagger` cli, which uses magical buildkit caching and orchestrations so it's all *fassstttt*. You can run it locally or in CI systems and get the same results, and confidence that things will actually work after a push.\n\nAs self-described a yamlbash enthusiast, I'm still excited at the thought of replacing those tangled messes with real code.\n\nCheck it out here, this version is capable of building Python wheel packages across a variety of Python versions, and can handle installation of extra build-time dependencies too, for when you need some ugly cmake stuff or other native libraries. Also, it uses wolfi and Chainguard images for all the execution and package handling :)\n\nhttps://lnkd.in/eDBtk7pm\n\n#dagger #ci #opensource #wolfi #chainguard\n\nChainloop is an Open Source Metadata Vault for your Software Supply Chain metadata, OWASP CycloneDX SBOM/xBOM Standard, SPDX SBOM, VEX, SARIF files, QA reports, and more.\n\nFrom today, you can programmatically collect and enforce Software Supply Chain pieces of evidence from your Dagger pipeline!\n\nDagger is a great fit since it is aligned with our principle of meeting developers where they are, and you can’t get closer to them than in code, with their programming language, and in their local machine 🙂\n\nIf you want to give it a try in person, we'll also be in a couple of days at #kubecon in Paris. See you there!\n\nI first saw a demo of Dagger two years ago and you could sense something big was brewing.\n\nNow with Dagger functions, it's actually happening. I just saw another demo and it really feels like something we'll all be using!\n\nCongrats Dagger for building something special!\n\nDagger is a programmable open source CI/CD engine. I built a Dagger module to solve the \"but it works on my machine\" problem that occurs where tests that pass locally do not pass in development because of inconsistencies in environment configurations for NodeJS applications. In this blog I detail the entire process; what I learnt through my build along with insights gained from reading Dagger docs and their Python SDK.\n\n#Python #CICD #Jest #NodeJS #DevOps #Frontend\n\nTestcontainers at Docker. Developer, author, speaker. Java Champion\n\nFeeling productive at #kubecon with @kylepenfound. We just made a @dagger_io module to enable @Testcontainers tests easily.\n\nThe one and only @solomonstre, thanks for been so welcoming. Eternally grateful for everything you did. Go @dagger_io !!!!! At #KubeCon\n\nNow that I understand the tao of dagger, I never want to write another dockerfile. But I have too 😢\n\nI finally ported some @fluentci_io modules to @dagger_io Modules\n\nMLOps Tech Lead | Public speaker\n\nIt can take many \"git push\" to get your #cicd pipeline working.\n\nArne Mueller and I wrote an article about using Dagger, which you can use to run your pipelines locally and in your #cicd tool of choice:\n\n➡ We walk through a pipeline that does unit testing, Python package building, and Docker image build and push.\n\n➡ We show the implementation of the pipeline defined \"old style\" in GitHub actions, and explain how you can run it locally with act.\n\n➡ We compare it with implementation using Dagger & very minimalistic GitHub actions.\n\nNo more \"push and pray 🙏\" for your #DevOps and #MLOps engineers!\n\nCheck it out on Marvelous MLOps substack: https://lnkd.in/eNcrdCiX.\n\nToday we had @solomonstre at the Ubisoft office - to talk about @dagger_io of course, but also our challenges. And I think he might start prototyping something soon for one of our use cases... how many CEOs do that? ;-) It was great, come back when you want!\n\nAdvocate of better Platforms for Devs\n\nYeah @dagger_io killed it with writing CI pipelines as code, and being able to run that locally. I can’t think of how else you can get a similar experience except by writing a bunch of bash with Docker.\n\nThere are two ways to ship code: 1. Push and Pray 2. Test, Test, Test, Test We recommend option #2. And use @dagger_io to make your life easy.\n\nDon't you just love when getting-started examples in the docs work\n\nBeen spending some time playing with @NetBoxOfficial @go_containerlab and @dagger_io and its pretty amazing how much can be done in the network automation space in what feels like a very cloud native way at the moment. Hoping to package it all up for a demo real soon 🚀 🚀 🚀\n\nHead of OSS @openmeterio | Speaker, tech content creator\n\n@dagger_io community meeting at @fosdem with @sameoldaweris\n\n@dagger_io has replaced a combination of dockerfiles, docker-compose, and makefiles/bash scripts for me, making it easier to run CI tests locally and in GitHub actions. Great work @solomonstre!\n\nUnexpected surprise using @dagger_io Cloud... If you export your key from your local development environment, then all of your local build results are side-by-side with your CI build results. It's pretty great being able to recall why something failed locally and then share it\n\nI just wrote my 1st @dagger_io modules https://github.com/vbehar/daggerverse… and the experience is really nice, thanks to the Dagger CLI.

    "description": "How do you use AI to write documentation without falling into the AI slop trap? We rebuilt our docs site using Rover and Claude, and here's what we learned.",
    "fullText": "As you probably know, Endor is the developer of the Rover coding agent manager. We use it extensively for our day to day programming. This past week, we did something new, non-coding related. We rebuilt our documentation site using Rover, Claude and our new tech-writer workflow.\n\nWe could tell you that we asked Rover and Claude to do all the work and the result was amazing right away. After all, our projects help you manage AI agents. However, that’s far from reality. Though we used Rover heavily, and was of great help, we still spent a significant amount of time writing documentation for our users.\n\nThis article describes the process we followed and what we learned from it. You can check out the final result at docs.endor.dev/rover/overview.\n\nWe’re living in an era of AI-generated fatigue. A wave of low-quality content also known as AI slop. New models keep improving, making it harder to distinguish between AI generated and human-written content. As a result, it’s tempting to generate an entire documentation site with AI because, unfortunately, writing documentation is not a task that many people enjoy.\n\nBut give it a little time and people start noticing patterns in how these models write certain type of content. Have you seen a myriad of README.md files with multiple titles and emojis? You only need to search for ”🚀 Quick Start” and ”✨ Key Features” in GitHub.\n\nOnce developers get used to these patterns, they tend to stop paying attention. Those documents are perfect for LLMs, but not for users. Good documentation needs a clear purpose, thoughtful structure, and an understanding of who it’s being written for.\n\nDocumentation is always written for somebody and to answer their question - not the curiosity of the writer\n\nSo, how did we build our documentation site using AI?\n\nWe split our process in 3 main steps:\n\nThe first step is straightforward: you’re creating documentation for your users, so involving them is essential to understand what matters to them and what’s missing. You don’t always need to ask them explicitly, but you can infer it from recurring questions, common pain points, or issues raised in your repository.\n\nFor example, we discovered that many people are not familiar with git worktrees. Describing a Rover workspace in terms of worktrees wasn’t helpful. Instead, we needed to explain the core idea first, and then mention that Rover uses Git worktrees under the hood to create isolated copies of your project where agents apply changes.\n\nOnce you’ve collected feedback, it’s time to shape it into an appropriate structure. The goal of good documentation is to guide new users through your project, and provide deeper, more detailed information for advanced ones.\n\nThere are plenty of great examples out there. Some documentation sites in the AI space that we particularly like are:\n\nOur key takeaways when designing the structure are:\n\nWe didn’t involve an AI agent until this point. Now that we have all the information and a solid structure, it’s time to create some tasks for our agents! With Rover, you can parallelize these tasks with a single command.\n\nIn our case, we asked it to build several documentation pages using the new tech-writer workflow.\n\nYou can find the generated documentation in pages like:\n\nUsing the tech-writer workflow gave us pretty consistent results across all these pages. We still needed to make some final tweaks, but about 95% of the work was done by Rover and the coding agents behind it.\n\nFor example, this is the task description we used to generate the Configuration page:\n\nCoding agents were extremely helpful. Using them, we rebuilt our documentation in two days. Without them, it would’ve taken us a week. But we still wrote key pages, such as Overview, Task, and Workflow entirely by hand.\n\nThose pages matter. They shape a user’s first impression of Rover. And while AI is great at generating grammatically correct text, it doesn’t naturally produce the intent, structure, and story that those pages need.\n\nOur advice: write the important parts yourself. Then let coding agents help polish, expand, and maintain them. AI can save you time, but it can’t replace your understanding of your users. In the end, that’s the point: AI doesn’t replace thoughtful documentation, it amplifies it.\n\nCheck out Rover on GitHub and the documentation to get started",

    "description": "Included in the haul is a cannon, two porcelain cups, and three gold and bronze coins.",
    "fullText": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\n\nHere’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nExperts brought to the surface the first treasures from the 1700s Spanish galleon the San José.\n\nConsidered the Holy Grail of shipwrecks, the Colombian government is planning to preserve these first finds.\n\nIncluded in the haul is a cannon, two porcelain cups, and three gold and bronze coins.\n\nThe hauling up of the world’s most valuable shipwreck has to start somewhere. So crews have brought to the surface three small gold and bronze coins from the 1700s, pulled from the Spanish galleon the San José, considered the Holy Grail of all shipwrecks. But there’s plenty more still sitting 1,970 feet below the ocean’s surface off the coast of Colombia, as much as $17 billion worth.\n\nThe San José, sunk by the British Royal Navy in the Caribbean during the War of Spanish Succession in 1708, was full of value. The ship was laden with 10 years’ worth of gold, silver, and gems, tribute from Spanish colonies in Latin America headed back to the Spanish king. Experts have now pulled up the first pieces from the ship, including coins, a cannon, and porcelain cups.\n\nAn English cannon sent the ship—part of the Flota de Tierra Firme fleet that left Peru in 1707—to the ocean’s floor. where it laid dormant for hundreds of years. The Colombian government claims it found the ship in 2015. Current estimates of the on-board value have ranged from $10 billion to $17 billion in today’s currency, sparking a custody battle between the Spanish and Colombian government over who has the rights to the loot.\n\nA recent study confirmed the presence of macuquinas coins—knowns as cobs in English—strewn across the wreck site around the San José. The Colombian Ministry of Culture, Arts, and Knowledge has taken the next steps to recover the treasure, using a robotic underwater vehicle to secure samples of the cargo.\n\nThe team used the equipment to search the structure of the vessel without disturbing the galleon, picking three coins, a bronze cannon (as well as fragments of wood, rope, and sediment from the cannon) and two porcelain cups—each with a different style. The team took the items to the Center for Archaeological and Historical Research and the National Museum of Colombia for preservation.\n\nAlhena Caicedo Fernandez, director of the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History said in a translated statement that collecting the objects “opens the possibility that citizen can approach, through material testimony, the history of the San José galleon.”\n\nAn estimated 200 tons of gold, silver, and uncut gemstones were aboard the ship, the result of 10 years of taxation saved up before the fleet’s planed voyage back to Spain. The macuquinas were the main currency in the Americas during the time, typically cut from gold or silver ingots, and were the primary way the Spanish transported large volumes of wealth from the Americas to Europe. These coin hoards likely formed part of the royal treasure dispatched from Peru. But when the fleet of 18 ships left Cartagena bound for Spain on June 8, 1708, it was attacked by five British warships. The cannon battle resulted in the explosion of the San José’s gunpowder stores, sinking the 150-foot-long ship.\n\nThe shipwreck—and treasured cargo—has sat on the ocean floor ever since. Now, bit by bit, it may reach the surface once more.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

Sources claimed that, within several months, it was clear that the Lebanese army was not capable of exerting power over Hezbollah.\n\nFor a long time, Jerusalem intended to intensify attacks against Hezbollah in order to deprive it of military capabilities, but the United States blocked the move.\n\nThe targeted assassination of Haytham Ali Tabatabai, Hezbollah’s chief of staff, was supposed to take place several months ago, but the authorities held off, hoping for a more opportune time for the strike, which would minimize collateral damage and would also be politically feasible.\n\nThe successful assassination was supposed to put Hezbollah’s leadership on the precipice of a dilemma again, but according to security sources in Hezbollah, they are determined to rebuild their military power as part of an evil axis led by Iran.\n\nHezbollah is working on two main efforts in parallel: The first is smuggling in various types of rockets, anti-tank missiles, and parts of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that were damaged during the campaign with Israel. Concurrently, the Shi'ite organization is working to build outposts, camps, and headquarters, and is moving some of its activities underground.\n\nHezbollah’s elite unit suffered painful blows during the campaign in the north. Despite Israel’s military accomplishments, Hezbollah is still capable of carrying out infiltration attempts, mainly in the western sector. Therefore, according to estimates, in preparation for any escalation, the IDF is to increase its forces on the border and in the settlements.\n\nThe IDF's Operations Directorate is preparing for a variety of scenarios in the Lebanese arena.\n\nAccording to sources at the top of the IDF, Israel cannot stand by as Hezbollah strengthens militarily and erodes the IDF’s achievements.\n\nThe sources further emphasized that the duration of the escalation will depend on the extent of Hezbollah’s response.",

    "fullText": "NEW YORK (AP) — Moments after Luigi Mangione was handcuffed at a Pennsylvania McDonald’s, a police officer searching his backpack found a loaded gun magazine wrapped in a pair of underwear.\n\nThe discovery, recounted in court Monday as Mangione fights to keep evidence out of his New York murder case, convinced police in Altoona, Pennsylvania, that he was the man wanted in the killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan five days earlier.\n\n“It's him, dude. It's him, 100%,” an officer was heard saying on body-worn camera video from Mangione’s Dec. 9, 2024 arrest, punctuating the remark with expletives as the officer combing the bag, Christy Wasser, held up the magazine.\n\nWasser, a 19-year Altoona police veteran, testified on the fourth day of a pretrial hearing as Mangione sought to bar prosecutors from using the magazine and other evidence against him, including a 9 mm handgun and a notebook found during a subsequent bag search.\n\nThe testimony shed light on the critical minutes after Mangione was spotted at the McDonald’s and the sometimes unusual steps police officers took in collecting evidence critical to tying him to the crime.\n\nWhy the defense says the evidence shouldn't be used at trial\n\nMangione’s lawyers argue the items should be excluded because police didn’t have a search warrant and lacked the grounds to justify a warrantless search. Prosecutors contend the search was legal and that police eventually obtained a warrant.\n\nWasser, testifying in full uniform, said Altoona police protocols require promptly searching a suspect’s property at the time of an arrest, in part for dangerous items.\n\nOn body-worn camera video played in court, Wasser was heard saying she wanted to check the bag for bombs before removing it from the McDonald’s. Despite that concern, she acknowledged in her testimony Monday that police never cleared the restaurant of customers or employees.\n\nMangione, 27, has pleaded not guilty to state and federal murder charges. He appeared in good health on Monday, pumping his fist for photographers and chatting with his lawyers as testimony resumed.\n\nThe hearing, which was postponed Friday because of Mangione’s apparent illness, applies only to the state case. His lawyers are making a similar push to exclude the evidence from his federal case, where prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.\n\nWhy prosecutors say jurors should be able to see the evidence\n\nProsecutors have said the handgun found in the backpack matches the firearm used in the killing and that writings in the notebook showed Mangione’s disdain for health insurers and ideas about killing a CEO at an investor conference.\n\nThompson, 50, was killed as he walked to a Manhattan hotel for his company’s investor conference on Dec. 4, 2024. Surveillance video showed a masked gunman shooting him from behind. Police have said “delay,” “deny” and “depose” were written on the ammunition, mimicking a phrase used to describe how insurers avoid paying claims.\n\nMangione was arrested in Altoona, about 230 miles (370 kilometers) west of Manhattan, after police there received a 911 call about a McDonald’s customer resembling the suspect.\n\nWasser testified that she went to the McDonald’s on her own to assist another officer, Joseph Detwiler. Before that, she said, she had seen some coverage of Thompson’s killing on Fox News, including the surveillance video of the shooting and images of the suspected shooter.\n\nWasser began searching Mangione’s bag as officers took him into custody on initial charges of forgery and false identification, after he acknowledged giving them a bogus driving license, police said. The same fake name was used by the alleged gunman used at a Manhattan hostel days before the shooting.\n\nWasser told another officer she wanted to check the bag for a bomb before leaving the McDonald’s because she didn’t want to repeat an incident in which another Altoona officer had inadvertently brought a bomb to the police station.\n\nWhat did police find in Mangione's bag?\n\n“Did you call the bomb squad?” Mangione lawyer Karen Friedman Agnifilo asked.\n\n“No. I didn’t find a bomb yet,” Wasser responded.\n\nAccording to body-worn camera video, the first few items Wasser found were innocuous: a hoagie, a loaf of bread and a smaller bag containing a passport, cellphone and computer chip.\n\nThen she pulled out a gray pair of underwear, unwrapping them to reveal the magazine.\n\nSatisfied there was no bomb, she suspended her search and placed some of the items back in the bag. Some evidence, including Mangione’s laptop computer, was transported to the police station in a brown paper McDonald’s takeout bag, body-worn camera video showed.\n\nWasser resumed her search after an 11-minute drive to the police station and almost immediately found the gun and silencer — the latter discovery prompting her to laugh and exclaim “nice,” according to body-worn camera footage. Wasser said the gun was in a side pocket that she hadn't searched at McDonald’s.\n\nLater, while cataloging everything in the bag in what's known as an inventory search, she found the notebook and other notes, including what appeared to to-do lists and possible getaway plans.\n\n“Isn't it awesome?” Wasser said at one point during the search, according to the body-worn camera video.\n\nAsked to explain, she told Friedman Agnifilo on Monday that she was proud of her police department’s work in helping to capture Thompson’s suspected killer.\n\nA Blair County, Pennsylvania, prosecutor testified that a judge later signed off on a search warrant for the bag, a few hours after the searches were completed. The warrant, she said, provided a legal mechanism for Altoona police to turn the evidence over to New York City detectives investigating Thompson’s killing.\n\nAs he has throughout the case, Assistant District Attorney Joel Seidemann described Thompson’s killing as an “execution” and referred to his notebook as a “manifesto” — terms that Mangione’s lawyers said were prejudicial and inappropriate.\n\nJudge Gregory Carro said the wording had “no bearing” on him, but warned Seidemann that he’s “certainly not going to do that at trial” when jurors are present.",

The calculus were made based on weight.\n\nThe first round resulted in 83 pounds (38 kilograms), which \"corresponds to approximately 23,000 to 24,000 coins,\" Vincent Geneviève, a numismatist with INRAP who is analyzing the hoards, told Live Science in an email.\n\nThe second weighing round yielded 100 pounds (50 kilograms) from the inside of the jug in question, plus the 400 coins recovered from the broken neck of the object, totaling 18,000 to 19,000 coins, according to INRAP.\n\nThe last jug was not found at the excavation site; only its imprint remained in the ground. By the time of the discovery, only three coins had been found.\n\n\"Contrary to what one might think at first glance, it is not certain that these are 'treasures' that were hidden during a period of insecurity,\" according to a November 26 translated statement from INRAP.\n\nThe experts who analysed the coins believe, based on the printed dates, that the discovery unburied a treasure from between A.D. 280 and 310. The coins were manufactured during the reign of emperors Victorinus, Tetricus I, and his son Tetricus II, during the Gallic Empire.\n\n\"In two cases, the presence of a few coins found stuck to the rim of the jar clearly indicates that they were deposited after the vase was buried, when the pit had not yet been filled with sediment,\" according to the statement of INRAP.\n\nGiven that the jars were at ground level and accessible, the specialists concluded that they were being used as a long-term savings instrument.",

    "fullText": "A Kenosha Police Department search warrant revealed new information about a Thanksgiving apartment fire that killed three children, which only their father survived\n\nJoshua Kannin, who was treated for smoke inhalation, told police that after waking up and seeming the fire, he \"panicked\" and walked out the front door to try and get help — and that upon his return, he could hear his kids inside, but was unable to get to them\n\nThe cause of the fire remains under investigation\n\nWisconsin father Joshua Kannin told police he panicked after realizing his home was on fire, leaving his three children inside while he ran to get help, according to a search warrant. He ended up being the sole survivor — and now their mom is asking why he left their kids behind.\n\nJourdan Feasby tells PEOPLE she spent Thanksgiving morning with her three children — Rylee, 10, Connor, 9 and Alena, 7 — before she dropped them off at their dad’s two-story apartment. Hours later, she learned her boys had perished in a fire and her daughter had been hospitalized.\n\nIn the hospital with their daughter, who later died, Feasby says she asked Kannin, \"You wouldn't grab the kids first?\"\n\n“Things weren’t adding up,\" she claims.\n\nKannin told police that around 9:00 p.m. on Nov. 27, Rylee and Conner went to sleep in their bedroom on the second floor. He himself went to bed about an hour later, at which time his daughter \"was awake\" and inside the room.\n\nAccording to a search warrant obtained by PEOPLE, Kannin said that when he woke up a short time later — officials responded to the fire just before 11:00 p.m. — his \"his eyes felt cloudy\" and that when he went downstairs, he saw \"a little fire on the kitchen floor.\"\n\n\"Joshua stated he panicked and walked out the front door,\" police wrote, saying the father told them he thought to himself, \"I have to get help.\"\n\nAs he was banging on his neighbor’s door, screaming for help, he yelled to his kids to come downstairs, according to the warrant.\n\n“I opened the door (to his residence) and I heard my kids. I tried to go back in, but smoke just came at me and I couldn’t see. I barely got two steps in and I had to turn back around,” Kannin was quoted as telling police. “When I opened the door, it made it even worse.”\n\nHe also stated that prior to going to bed, he had a cigarette in the kitchen by the sink, but that he believed he extinguished it prior to going to sleep.\n\nWhen first responders arrived, they found two children who were believed to be deceased — later identified as brothers Rylee and Connor — and another child who was severely burned.\n\nThe area where they were found is the kitchen/dining room area of the apartment, Feasby tells PEOPLE.\n\nAlena, described in the report as being found either in the second floor bedroom or near the stairwell, was taken to a nearby hospital, where she succumbed to her injuries.\n\nKannin was taken to a nearby hospital where he was treated for smoke inhalation. Feasby says he was released the following morning.\n\nIn response to the release of a search warrant, the Kenosha Police Department issued a clarification regarding the status of their ongoing investigation.\n\nThe warrant stated the investigators were examining the possibility of arson and potential homicide. Under Wisconsin law, law enforcement must outline potential criminal charges when applying for a search warrant in order to establish probable cause.\n\nNever miss a story — \nThe search warrant made public was drafted on the night of the fire after a black Samsung cell phone belonging to Kannin was recovered at the scene. The phone was subsequently searched in accordance with the warrant. That search did not reveal any evidence of criminal activity related to the fire.\n\n“As the investigation progresses, in conjunction with the Kenosha Fire Department, they will continue to methodically rule out all possible causes of the fire,” KPD spokesman Lt. Joshua Hecker told PEOPLE. “This is a complex and evolving case, and we remain committed to a thorough, impartial, and evidence-driven investigation.”\n\nOn Friday, services were held for the three siblings. Feasby, who spoke about her children during the services, says Kannin attended, but did not speak to the mourners gathered there.

    "fullText": "A federal judge investigating whether Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem should face a contempt charge over flights carrying migrants to El Salvador said Monday he wants to hear from a whistleblower and top Justice Department official.\n\nU.S. District Judge James Boasberg in Washington ordered the government to make Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign available for testimony on Dec. 16. Boasberg wants to hear a day earlier from fired Justice Department attorney Erez Reuveni.\n\nThe order for testimony ratchets up the extraordinary clash between the judicial and executive branches.\n\nIn March, Boasberg ordered the Republican administration to turn around two planes carrying Venezuelan migrants.\n\nInstead, the planes landed in El Salvador hours later, touching off the contempt probe. Boasberg is trying to determine whether the administration willfully ignored his order and should be referred for prosecution on a contempt charge.\n\nReuveni has filed a whistleblower complaint alleging a Justice Department official suggested the Trump administration might have to ignore court orders as it prepared to deport Venezuelan migrants it accused of being gang members. The administration has said the allegations are untrue.\n\nThe Justice Department has said Ensign conveyed Boasberg’s oral order and a subsequent written order to the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nIn a written declaration submitted to the court Friday, Noem said she made the decision not to return the planes to the U.S. after receiving “privileged legal advice” from the Homeland Security Department’s acting general counsel and “through him from the senior leadership of the Department of Justice.”\n\nBoasberg, who was nominated to the federal bench by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, called Noem’s declaration “cursory.”\n\n“As this declaration does not provide enough information for the Court to determine whether her decision was a willful violation of the Court’s Order, the Court cannot at this juncture find probable cause that her actions constituted criminal contempt,” the judge wrote in Monday's order.\n\nThe administration has said it did not violate Boasberg’s order. The judge’s directive to return the planes was made verbally in court but not included in his written order, government attorneys said in a court filing in November.\n\nThat order blocked the administration from removing “any of the individual Plaintiffs from the United States for 14 days,” but said nothing about the flights already airborne, they said.\n\nThe two planes had already departed U.S. territory and airspace, so the migrants aboard them had already been “removed” and therefore fell outside of the court’s order, Justice Department lawyers said in the court filing.\n\nJustice Department attorneys in a court filing Friday objected to any “live testimony,” urging Boasberg instead to “proceed promptly” with a criminal contempt referral if he believed his order was “sufficiently clear in imposing an obligation to halt the transfer of custody for detainees who had already been removed from the United States.”",

    "description": "The Minnesota Twins announced a sale to two minority partners months ago and the first has finally been revealed.",
    "fullText": "The sale process for the Minnesota Twins was among the most exciting developments to take place in recent seasons. The Pohlad family has become a stain on the franchise, and drawn ire from the fanbase for years. There was nothing more celebrated when it was announced last offseason that the group would move on.\n\nUnfortunately, because the current living members of the family have little idea how to manage their wealth, the franchise absorbed a considerable amount of debt. That made a sale of the Twins untenable, and instead turned the deal into an absorption of debt in exchange for equity.\n\nWe have head about a pair of minority partners for months now, but their identities have been in question. With the Winter Meetings kicking off this week, and reports suggesting that Minnesota will build around their current stars, an announcement of news made sense.\n\nConfirmed: The Minnesota Twins are Now Buyers\n\nWashington Nationals Scoop Up Former Twins Coaches\n\nFormer MN Twins Infielder Nearing New Deal\n\nThe Pohlad family announced they would remain in control of the Minnesota Twins, but that two minority partners were joining them. To this point the only information we had was that one group was local, and one was based on the east coast. Pioneer Press columnist Charley Walters has now made the Minnesota entity public.\n\nLook for Minneapolis-based Varde Partners, a worldwide multi-billion dollar credit investment corporation, to be announced soon as a limited partner with the Minnesota Twins. The firm is one of at least two limited partners expected to assist in diminishing the team’s reported $500 million debt.\n\nCharley Walters – Pioneer Press\n\nVarde Partners is described as a global credit and investment firm. They are based in Minneapolis and would seemingly be rooted in the local economy. Managing partners include Brad Bauer, Francisco Milone, and Tim Mooney.\n\nGiven the landscape and success of their current business, it’d be hard to believe they don’t have more business acumen than the current iteration of Pohlads. Reports suggest they manage between $16-17 billion in assets and have over 300 global employees.\n\nHow the impact of these minority partners hits the Minnesota Twins remains to be seen. Their influx of cash should be expected to lop off the Pohlads debt, and hopefully there are more motivated individuals to pay for competitive resources in the future.\n\nIt’s possible with one of the two partners now unveiled, we hear about the second entity in short order as well.\n\nConfirmed: The Minnesota Twins are Now Buyers\n\nWashington Nationals Scoop Up Former Twins Coaches\n\nFormer MN Twins Infielder Nearing New Deal",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump on Monday falsely denied making a comment he had made on camera just five days prior. Then he launched a personal attack against the reporter who had accurately repeated his previous remark.\n\nTrump has a long history of falsely denying he ever said things he had said in public.\n\nThe subject of his latest false denial was the video footage of the September 2 US military strikes against a suspected drug-smuggling boat in the Caribbean. The military conducted a follow-up strike to kill the people who had survived the first strike.\n\nThe Trump administration publicly released the video of the initial strike but not the video of the follow-up strike, which has been shown to members of Congress behind closed doors. On December 3, Trump said he has no problem releasing this video to the American people.\n\nHere’s the December 3 exchange he had with ABC News reporter Selina Wang at the White House:\n\nWang: Mr. President, you released video of that first boat strike on September 2nd, but not the second video. Will you release video of that strike so that the American people can see for themselves what happened?\n\nTrump: I don’t know what they have, but whatever they have we’d certainly release, no problem.\n\nOn Monday, another ABC News reporter, Rachel Scott, repeated Trump’s comment back to him while trying to ask a question about the potential release of the additional video. But the president denied he had said what he said:\n\nScott: Mr. President, you said you would have no problem with releasing the full video of that strike on September 2nd off the coast of Venezuela. Secretary Hegseth now says –\n\nTrump: I didn’t say that. That’s – you said that, I didn’t say that. This is ABC fake news.\n\nScott correctly noted, “You said that you would have no problem releasing the full vi(deo).” She then pivoted back to her question. She noted that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth says the question of whether to release the video is being reviewed, and she asked Trump if he is ordering Hegseth to release it.\n\n“Whatever he decides is okay with me,” Trump said.\n\nTrump then offered a defense of the strikes, repeating his frequent false claim that each boat destroyed saves “25,000 American lives” and claiming the survivors “were trying to turn the boat back to where it could float, and we didn’t want to see that, because that boat was loaded up with drugs.” When Scott eventually interjected to try to return to the issue of releasing the video, he called her “the most obnoxious reporter in the whole place” and “actually a terrible reporter.”\n\nCNN has reached out to an ABC News spokesperson about the president’s remarks about Scott. Another ABC News journalist, Jonathan Karl, wrote on the social media platform X that Scott “quoted President Trump accurately.”",

Reuters reported on Friday that the government is reviewing that proposal.\n\nThe discussions are ⁠being privately opposed by big ‌smartphone firms Apple, Google and Samsung, due to privacy and security concerns.\n\nIn a statement to Reuters, Amnesty International said location data can ‍be \"incredibly revealing\" and can expose personal and professional connections, such as the confidential sources who meet journalists or human rights groups.\n\n\"This is deeply concerning. At a time where surveillance scandals are a ​mushrooming global threat, states should be working on improving their practices and safeguards, not ‌forcing people to reveal yet more sensitive data,\" Amnesty said.\n\nIndia's IT and home ministries, which are reviewing the plan, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Monday about the backlash.\n\nAmnesty has in the past denounced India's surveillance practices including alleged use of Pegasus spyware to target journalists and activists -- allegations Modi's government has repeatedly denied.\n\nA fierce ⁠privacy debate erupted in India last week after ​Reuters first reported another confidential directive from the ​government to preload a state-run cyber safety app on all smartphones. India was forced to revoke the order following outcry from activists and politicians ‍over fears of snooping.\n\n\"Why ⁠are we out to convert India into a 'Surveillance State'?\" Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala said on X, criticising the proposal to track phone locations.\n\nA large ⁠number of Indian users on X joined Surjewala and other privacy activists to condemn the plan, with ‌one user framing it as turning phones into \"digital ankle monitors\".",

A lower federal appeals court had ruled that removing the books did not violate Constitutional free speech protections.  The Supreme Court's decision to not consider the case was criticized by free speech rights groups.",
    "fullText": "AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal on a Texas free speech case that allowed local officials to remove books deemed objectionable from public libraries.\n\nThe case stemmed from a 2022 lawsuit by a group of residents in rural Llano County over the removal from the public library of more than a dozen books dealing with sex, race and gender themes, as well as humorously touching on topics such as flatulence.\n\nA lower federal appeals court had ruled that removing the books did not violate Constitutional free speech protections.\n\nThe case had been closely watched by publishers and librarians across the country. The Supreme Court's decision to not consider the case was criticized by free speech rights groups.\n\nThe Texas case has already been used to ban books in other areas of the country, said Elly Brinkley, staff attorney for U.S. Free Expression Programs at PEN America.\n\n“Leaving the Fifth Circuit’s ruling in place erodes the most elemental principles of free speech and allows state and local governments to exert ideological control over the people with impunity. The government has no place telling people what they can and cannot read,\" Brinkley said.\n\nSam Helmick, president of the American Library Association, said the Supreme Court's decision not to consider the case \"threatens to transform government libraries into centers for indoctrination instead of protecting them as centers of open inquiry, undermining the First Amendment right to read unfettered by viewpoint-based censorship.”\n\nThe Texas case began when a group of residents asked the county library commission to remove the group of books from circulation. The local commission ordered librarians to comply and a separate group of residents sued to keep the books on the shelves.\n\nLlano County, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) northwest of the Texas capital of Austin, has a population of about 20,000. It is mostly white and conservative, with deep ties to agriculture and deer hunting.\n\nThe book titles originally ordered removed included, “Caste: The Origins of Our Discontent” by Isabel Wilkerson; “They Called Themselves the K.K.K: The Birth of an American Terrorist Group,” by Susan Campbell Bartoletti; “In the Night Kitchen” by Maurice Sendak; “It’s Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex and Sexual Health” by Robie H. Harris; and “Being Jazz: My Life as a (Transgender) Teen” by Jazz Jennings.\n\nOther titles include “Larry the Farting Leprechaun” by Jane Bexley and “My Butt is So Noisy!” by Dawn McMillan.\n\nA federal judge ordered the county to restore some of the books in 2023, but that decision was reversed earlier this year by the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which covers Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nThe county at one point briefly considered closing its public libraries rather than return the books to the shelves after the federal judge's initial order.\n\nIn its order on May 23, the appeals court's majority opinion said the decision to remove a book from the library shelf is not a book ban.\n\n“No one is banning (or burning books). If a disappointed patron can't find a book in the library, he can order it online, buy it from a bookstore or borrow it from a friend,” the appeals court opinion said.\n\nLlano County Judge Ron Cunningham, the ranking official in the county, did not immediately respond to an email to his office seeking comment.\n\nHillel Italie contributed from New York City.",

    "description": "Blood type A(B) is caused by a four gene mutations and was discovered when the blood of patients and donors was being studied in a Thai hospital.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nThere are rare blood types beyond the eight most common ones, and researchers have discovered one more that brings the total count to 49.\n\nBlood type A(B) is caused by a four gene mutations and was discovered when the blood of patients and donors was being studied in a Thai hospital.\n\nBecause similar mutations have been known to occur in other contexts, there could be more that are still undiscovered.\n\nWhat’s your sign? What’s your aura? What’s your blood type? While horoscopes and New Age crystals often provide clear answers to the first two questions, the last one on that list can get complicated sometimes.\n\nBlood types are identified by antigens—compounds made of sugars and proteins that alert the immune system to the presence of something foreign in the body—and they are the foundation of the ABO blood group system laid out by Karl Landsteiner in 1901. The A antigen has N-acetylgalactosamine as its dominant sugar, the B antigen is dominated by the sugar D-galactose, and type AB blood has both antigens. Type O positive uses a different antigen altogether (known as the rhesus, or Rh, factor), and Type O negative has none of the above. All of this complexity is encoded into proteins by out ABO gene, located on our ninth chromosome.\n\nWhile interesting in and of themselves, antigens become especially important when it comes to donating blood to and receiving blood from others. For blood transfusions to succeed, the antigens of the patient’s blood and the donor’s blood have to match, or else the new blood will be rejected by antibodies in the plasma. This is whytype O negative blood is seen as the universal donor type—because it has neither of the A or B antigens nor the Rh(D) antigen, there is virtually no risk of rejection.\n\nBut even rarer blood types than O negative exist. There are fifty people on the entire planet with Rh-negative blood, nicknamed “golden blood,” which is completely devoid of Rh antigens. And there is only one individual known to have Gwada negative blood, which was only discovered earlier this year. While O negative is only found in 7% of the global population, researchers who tested the blood of patients and donors in a Thai hospital have now discovered yet another new type that runs through the veins of only three known individuals (it was found in one patient and two donors). What is now recognized as type B(A) has mostly B antigens, but also trace A antigens.\n\n“ABO discrepancies were distinct between donors and patients even in the same ethnicity,” the researchers said in a study recently published in the journal Transfusion and Apheresis Science. “This finding highlighted the influence of the patient’s conditions and therapy on the anomalous ABO typing. Additionally, the B(A) individuals identified in this study carried identical genetic alterations that differed from all antecedent alleles of the B(A) phenotype.”\n\nThe researchers saw four alleles—alternative forms of certain genes at the same location on a chromosome—on the B(A) type that differed from alleles associated with other blood type and created B(A). Mutations like this had previously been seen in many ethnicities, including individuals from other parts of Asia, but it was the first time such a phenomenon was ever recorded in the Thai population. B(A) adds one more type to the 48 already known to occur in humans.\n\nThere could be more blood types out there that remain undiscovered, and more individuals with those extremely rare blood types. And the three currently known occurrences of B(A) may not be the only ones in the world. Further research may find more of either, and this discovery is proof that blood typing is not so simple as ABO.\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "fullText": "A nurse who raped a vulnerable colleague after threatening her with the sack if she did not perform sex acts has been jailed for almost eight years.\n\nNaijil Paul also sexually assaulted two other young women while working as a care home manager in North Lanarkshire.\n\nHe was sentenced at the High Court in Glasgow to seven years and nine months in jail, having been extradited back to Scotland from India for the trial.\n\nPaul admitted to the crimes at a hearing in October, but the court heard that despite his guilty pleas he had shown \"quite a degree of victim blaming\" in a pre-sentencing report - to the extent he claimed he thought he was doing one of the women a favour.\n\nMore stories from Glasgow & West Scotland\n\nThe court heard the 47-year-old ordered the rape victim to \"do what I want\" or said she would face the sack.\n\nThe 26-year-old victim had returned from sick leave in April 2018, and had told a senior colleague that her debt was a significant factor in coming back.\n\nA week later, Paul entered the woman's office while she was alone and closed the door.\n\nHe told her that she was at risk of losing her job due to the amount of time she had off. He said that he was aware of her financial problems and that she could be evicted from her home with her children.\n\nHe told her to \"do what I want\" and referred to a sex act then stated her job would be safe if she did this. He added that if she refused, it would be her fault her children would be homeless.\n\nAfter raping her, he told her not to tell anyone as \"no one will believe you and your job won't be safe\".\n\nThe woman burst into tears and fled.\n\nShe went off on sick leave again and did not tell anyone what happened until a police probe into Paul's offending.\n\nThe hearing was told about a 19-year-old care assistant who Paul tried to kiss, after placed his hands on her hips.\n\nHe told the woman: \"I know you want this.\"\n\nTwo weeks later, Paul moved her hand towards an intimate area of his body, while on another occasion he grabbed the waistband of her trousers and said he wanted to see what colour of underwear she had on.\n\nPaul also asked a 21-year-old care assistant if she was serious about her boyfriend.\n\nHe put his hand on her shoulder and waist then said: \"I know you want it. I can tell by your body language.\"\n\nOn another occasion, Paul tried to kiss her before he was shoved away. Later that day, he then molested the woman.\n\nShe told another colleague of being frightened she would lose her job if she complained.\n\nPaul will be supervised for a further two years on his release.\n\nHe will also be on the sex offenders list for life and is banned from going near any of the victims.\n\nPaul was due to stand trial in 2019, but he did not appear and a warrant was granted for his arrest.\n\nHe fled to Kochi in India, claiming his father had been ill, before being arrested in February this year and extradited from Delhi to Scotland.\n\nHe admitted to charges of rape and two charges of sexual assault and the sentence was cut from eight years due to the guilty plea.\n\nHowever Lord Renucci remarked to Paul's KC Edith Forrest about comments made by him in a pre-sentencing report.\n\nThe judge said he was concerned by the victim blaming in his comments and that although he was assessed as being medium risk of re-offending, Lord Renucci believed that \"very much underestimates his level of risk\".\n\nThe judge told Paul he had been in a position of power before carrying out offences which were planned and deliberate.\n\nHe added: \"In addition to the serious and predatory nature of your offending, notwithstanding the fact you pled guilty, the version of events given by you bears little resemblance to what you have admitted to.\"\n\nThe judge said this even went as far as describing the rape as a \"sexual encounter\" which was \"consensual\".",

Sears filed for bankruptcy in 2018 and then bought out of that in 2019. The struggles have continued since, though, and the retailer is just hanging on by a thread.\n\nFor folks looking for a bit of nostalgia and a trip to the store before it is no more, the final five Sears locations are in Coral Gables, Florida; Orlando, Florida; Braintree, Massachusetts; Concord, California and El Paso, Texas.",

    "description": "These are today's mortgage and refinance rates. People shouldn't necessarily wait until after the Fed meeting to lock in a rate, as rates are likely to hold steady.",
    "fullText": "Some offers on this page are from advertisers who pay us, which may affect which products we write about, but not our recommendations. See our Advertiser Disclosure.\n\nMortgage rates have risen since last week. According to Zillow data, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is up 13 basis points to 6.10%, and the 15-year fixed rate has increased by 14 basis points to 5.55%.\n\nThe Federal Reserve will announce whether it is cutting the federal funds rate for a third time this year on Wednesday. Many experts predict that the central bank will lower its rate again — but based on how mortgage rates have reacted to previous rate cuts, that doesn't necessarily mean home loan rates will decrease in response. However, they might fall if the Fed indicates that it intends to slash rates more aggressively next year.\n\nLearn more about why mortgage rates didn't decrease after the last fed funds rate cut.\n\nHere are the current mortgage rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nRemember, these are the national averages and rounded to the nearest hundredth.\n\nSee the mortgage lenders with the best rates this week.\n\nThese are today's mortgage refinance rates, according to the latest Zillow data:\n\nAgain, the numbers provided are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. Mortgage refinance rates are often higher than rates when you buy a house, although that's not always the case.\n\nMORE: Read about the best mortgage refinance lenders right now.\n\nYou can use the free Yahoo Finance mortgage calculator below to play around with how different terms and rates will affect your monthly payment. Our calculator considers factors like property taxes and homeowners insurance when estimating your monthly mortgage payment. This gives you a better idea of your total monthly payment than if you just looked at mortgage principal and interest.\n\nYou can bookmark the Yahoo Finance mortgage payment calculator and keep it handy for future use, as you shop for homes and lenders.\n\nToday’s average 30-year mortgage rate is 6.10%. A 30-year term is the most popular type of mortgage because by spreading out your payments over 360 months, your monthly payment is relatively low.\n\nIf you had a $300,000 mortgage with a 30-year term and a 6.10% rate, your monthly payment toward the principal and interest would be about $1,818, and you’d pay $354,474 in interest over the life of your loan — on top of that original $300,000.\n\nThe average 15-year mortgage rate is 5.55% today. Several factors must be considered when deciding between a 15-year and 30-year mortgage.\n\nA 15-year mortgage comes with a lower interest rate than a 30-year term. This is great in the long run because you’ll pay off your loan 15 years sooner, and that’s 15 fewer years for interest to compound.\n\nHowever, your monthly payments will be higher because you’re squeezing the same debt payoff into half the time.\n\nIf you get that same $300,000 mortgage with a 15-year term and a 5.55% rate, your monthly payment would jump to $2,459. But you’d only pay $142,659.\n\nHow much house can I afford? Use our home affordability calculator.\n\nWith an adjustable-rate mortgage, your rate is locked in for a set period of time and then increases or decreases periodically. For example, with a 5/1 ARM, your rate stays the same for the first five years, then changes every year.\n\nAdjustable rates usually start lower than fixed rates, but you run the risk that your rate goes up once the introductory rate-lock period is over. But an ARM could be a good fit if you plan to sell the home before your rate-lock period ends — that way, you pay a lower rate without worrying about it rising later.\n\nLately, ARM rates have occasionally been similar to or higher than fixed rates. Before dedicating yourself to a fixed or adjustable mortgage rate, be sure to shop around for the best lenders and rates. Some will offer more competitive adjustable rates than others.\n\nMortgage lenders typically give the lowest mortgage rates to people with higher down payments, excellent credit scores, and low debt-to-income ratios. So if you want a lower rate, try saving more, improving your credit score, or paying down some debt before you start shopping for homes.\n\nYou can also buy down your interest rate permanently by paying for discount points at closing. A temporary interest rate buydown is also an option — for example, maybe you get a 6.25% rate with a 2-1 buydown. Your rate would start at 4.25% for year one, increase to 5.25% for year two, then settle in at 6.25% for the remainder of your term.\n\nJust consider whether these buydowns are worth the extra money at closing. Ask yourself if you’ll stay in the home long enough that the amount you save with a lower rate offsets the cost of buying down your rate before making your decision.\n\nHere are interest rates for some of the most popular mortgage terms: According to Zillow data, the national average 30-year fixed rate is 6.10%, the 15-year fixed rate is 5.55%, and the 5/1 ARM rate is 6.45%.\n\nA normal mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed loan is 6.10%. However, keep in mind that's the national average based on Zillow data. The average might be higher or lower depending on where you live in the U.S.\n\nMortgage rates are not expected to drop significantly before the end of the year, as economists continue to monitor inflation, tariffs, and the Federal Reserve's actions.\n\nIf you want to refinance your mortgage before the end of 2025, you're in luck. It may be a good time. Learn the steps to take to refi in the next couple of months.\n\nA mortgage refinance involves replacing your original home loan with a new one. Learn how to refinance a mortgage loan and decide if it's the right choice for you.\n\nMortgage rates are down, so refinancing soon could be a good idea.

The range of punishment on First Degree Murder is life or life without the possibility of parole.”\n\nDarci Lambert, 24, and Jorden McGuire, 34, will now face first-degree murder and two counts of animal cruelty in connection with the dog mauling death of their 2-year-old daughter at their home in northeast Oklahoma City, said Behenna’s office.\n\n“This is an unspeakably tragic case,” said Vicki Zemp Behenna, Oklahoma County\nDistrict Attorney. “Lambert and McGuire’s complete disregard for the health, safety, and welfare of their child, and their failure to protect her despite knowing she was at risk, led to her death.”\n\nKFOR previously covered the incident that occurred on November 18, 2025 where police were called to a residence regarding a child not breathing. Upon arrival, officers located a child deceased with injuries consistent with an animal attack.\n\nLambert and McGuire are alleged to have failed to protect their child and permitted the child to remain in the presence of a dog(s) that was found by Animal Welfare to be malnourished.

Asim Munir made his remarks at his headquarters in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where he received a guard of honor from all three branches of the military, marking the launch of Pakistan’s new joint military command.\n\nHis appointment was confirmed last week in what officials said would improve coordination among the army, navy and air force, amid shifting regional security dynamics.\n\nMunir said that the new Defence Forces Headquarters marks a historic step, creating a unified tri-services command to boost coordination across land, air, sea, cybersecurity and information domains amid rising security threats, according to a military statement.\n\nMunir told officers that a “clear message” had been delivered to the Taliban government in Kabul: it must decide between Pakistan and “Fitna al-Khawarij,” a term authorities use for the outlawed Pakistani Taliban, known a s Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP.\n\nThe TTP, though separate, is closely aligned with the Afghan Taliban and has been emboldened since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021.\n\nThere was no immediate comment from Kabul.\n\nRelations between the two neighbors have deteriorated since October, when several days of border clashes killed dozens of soldiers, civilians and suspected militants and wounded hundreds more. The violence followed Oct. 9 explosions in Kabul that Taliban authorities blamed on Pakistan. A Qatar-mediated ceasefire has largely held since October, though they failed to reach an agreement in November, despite holding three rounds of talks in Istanbul.\n\nMunir has risen to prominence since earlier this year, when Pakistan said it repelled India in a four-day conflict. The two nuclear-armed rivals exchanged tit-for-tat strikes in May after India targeted militants inside Pakistan, accusing them of involvement in the massacre of 26 tourists in India-controlled Kashmir.\n\nThe confrontation eased only after U.S. President Donald Trump announced that India and Pakistan had agreed to a “full and immediate ceasefire.”\n\nMunir said the operations during the conflict have become a “textbook example” of future warfare. He also presented awards to Pakistan navy and air force personnel for their roles in the fighting.\n\nMunir said that “India must remain under no illusion that Pakistan’s next response will be even swifter and more severe.” He said that Pakistan is a peace-loving country, “but no one will be allowed to test its resolve regarding sovereignty, territorial integrity, peace or stability.”\n\nPakistan and India have a long history of bitter relations and have fought three of their wars over the disputed Himalayan region of Kashmir since gaining independence from British rule in 1947.",

    "fullText": "Reid Hoffman said he once spent a night on Epstein's island in connection with MIT fundraising efforts.\n\nThe LinkedIn cofounder told the Newcomer podcast that he had been told a visit would make Epstein more likely to donate.\n\nHoffman has previously apologized publicly for his interactions with Epstein.\n\nLinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said he wishes he'd known a little more before agreeing to spend a night on Jeffrey Epstein's island.\n\nOn the Dec. 1 episode of Eric Newcomer's podcast, Hoffman said that he visited the island as part of his fundraising work for the MIT Foundation and was told the visit would make Epstein more likely to donate to MIT.\n\n\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. He said he stayed on the island for one night, and that there was a pool, a \"bunch of guest rooms,\" and a courtyard.\n\nHoffman has maintained that he only interacted with Epstein, whose 2019 death while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges was ruled a suicide, through his work fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. On the \"Newcomer\" podcast, he called Epstein a \"masterful networker,\" and recalled a 2015 dinner he hosted for an MIT researcher in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHoffman said that Joi Ito, former director of the MIT Media Lab, asked him if Epstein could attend the dinner, which was also attended by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Similar to his visit to the island, Hoffman said he was later told that the financier had said he was more likely to donate if he attended the dinner.\n\n\"He's kind of going through the network, trying to meet people and so forth,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. Hoffman also reiterated previous apologies for his involvement with Epstein.\n\nIn 2019, a spokesperson for Zuckerberg confirmed the dinner to Business Insider and said it was the only time the Facebook cofounder met Epstein. A spokesperson for Musk also confirmed the Tesla CEO's attendance.\n\nIn a 2019 email to Axios, Hoffman acknowledged multiple interactions with Epstein, which he said were strictly for fundraising purposes, and said he had been told MIT had vetted and approved the convicted sex offender's participation. He said in the email he was \"deeply regretful\" of the involvement.\n\n\"I went and kind of made a, you know, very public apology because it was like, okay I realized this and I'd already at that point had ramped down connection with him, right, to like no meetings and all the rest of the stuff, under any context,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. \"And I think he still would drop me an email every so often and say, 'Hey, can we get on the phone?' I say, 'Oh, maybe sometime,' which is, you know, code for never, right?\"\n\nHoffman said that justice for the late pedophile's victims is important, and urged the government to release, unredacted, \"every single piece of intel that they have about Epstein.\"\n\nIn November, President Donald Trump signed a bill that will release the Department of Justice's files on Epstein after months of pressure from Congress, including some fellow Republicans. The department has until Saturday, December 19, to comply with the order.\n\nTrump has also ordered the DOJ to investigate Hoffman, along with other individuals he views as political enemies, including former President Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, over their ties to Epstein.\n\nHoffman, a billionaire and major Democratic donor, has previously said that he had to hire security after Musk fueled conspiracy theories about his relationship with Epstein.",

    "description": "The two-masted schooner was fully intact—a rarity in Great Lakes shipwreck finds.",
    "fullText": "Here’s what you’ll learn when you read this story:\n\nA Canadian dive team scouring Lake Ontario for a shipwreck discovered far more than they expected.\n\nThe team was diving to find a 1917 wrecked ship, but instead believe they stumbled on a vessel possibly 100 years older.\n\nThe two-masted schooner was fully intact—a rarity in Great Lakes shipwreck finds.\n\nA team of five divers descended over 300 feet into Lake Ontario’s dark waters near Toronto and found much more than they were dreaming of. In a search for what the team surmised could be a ship lost in 1917, they instead found a shipwreck they believe is possibly 100 years older.\n\nThe divers discovered a two-masted schooner sitting upright, with both masts still fully intact, in what the Ontario Underwater Council called an “extraordinary state of preservation for a Great Lakes vessel.” After some preliminary investigation, the team believes the ship may come from an under-documented period of Great Lakes shipbuilding, sometime between 1800 and 1850.\n\n“It took us a few moments to calm ourselves down because it’s overwhelming finding a pristine wreck that is all in one piece,” Heison Chak, the president of the Ontario Underwater Council, told the CBC. “It’s got its shape. It hasn’t broken down both masts. We saw two—both masts were standing, which is pretty rare. In all the rest that I have dove, either they have fallen off, because boats come across them, anchors wreck them, [or] divers damage them.”\n\nA fiber-optic cable survey of the lake from Buffalo to Toronto alerted experts to an anomaly sitting on the lakebed, leading experts to surmise it could be the Rapid City vessel, an 1884-built schooner lost in 1917.\n\nNow, though, they don’t think it can be that recent a wreckage.\n\nJames Conolly, Trent University archaeologist and diver, said there were features that just weren’t common for ships built after 1850, a period that experienced a bit of a technological leap for Great Lakes ships. Post-1850s ships had metal rigging, whereas the one found is rope-rigged. “It immediately puts it into, likely, the first half of the 19th century,” Conolly said.\n\nOther features were different than what the team was expecting to find, including the ship having no wheel on the aft deck, an early windlass design, and no centerboard winch that became a standard movable keel for Great Lakes ships during the 1850s.\n\nWhile the 1850s may have seen a modern boon for shipbuilding in the Great Lakes, the previous 50 years helped kickstart lake-travel trade, even if the ships built were commonly lost due to storms and mishaps. Much of the history of the era is also lost.\n\n“This is deep enough that I don’t think anyone’s been on it,” Chak said. “I think we’re the first group and that joy was just overwhelming.”\n\nNot everyone is so readily convinced. Charles Beeker, a Great Lakes shipwreck expert and professor at Indiana University, told the CBC it’s too early to say the vessel is from 1800 to 1850. “I don’t want to diminish the value of it,” he said. “They may be able to identify the vessel, maybe identify the shipyard, and that would be useful to look at an actual intact vessel on the bottom to compare to what little we do have in terms of drawings, and tonnage, and information from these vessels, and the older you go, the less information we have.”\n\nLayers of invasive quagga mussels cover much of the woodwork, eroding the detailing. “Where a wreck might once have survived intact for centuries,” Conolly said, “we now have only decades to study it before biological and environmental factors take their toll.”\n\nThe team plans to further explore the wreck, hoping to get more detailed measurements, photography, and wood sampling to pinpoint the ship’s age and history.\n\n“We don’t know, but if it is really that era,” Chak said, “from 1800 to 1850, I think we will have even more celebration because we hit the jackpot where there is very little history or studied documented material about shipwrecks, ships, or shipbuilding in that era.”\n\nThe Do’s and Don’ts of Using Painter’s Tape\n\nThe Best Portable BBQ Grills for Cooking Anywhere\n\nCan a Smart Watch Prolong Your Life?",

    "description": "\"You don't want to mess with a mom python.\"",
    "fullText": "A new TV show is shining a light on just how much damage an invasive snake is doing to Floridian ecosystems.\n\nABC's \"Wildlife Nation: Expedition Florida\" examined Burmese pythons in a recent episode. Researchers were able to find an old nest of eggs, where they were able to describe the scene.\n\n\"First of all, they're incredibly protective. You don't want to mess with a mom python,\" said host Jeff Corwin.\n\nThey went on to describe how the snakes, which generally don't produce much of their own heat, actually shiver in order to keep eggs warm and incubate them in a tight clutch. Burmese pythons lay between 12 and 36 eggs every spring.\n\nThe researchers on the show are quick to highlight that Burmese pythons are a massive problem in Florida. As apex predators, their eggs don't face any serious predators, which allow their young to propagate unopposed.\n\nBurmese pythons are considered one of the most (if not the top) invasive species in Florida. They were originally introduced to the wild in the state through the exotic pet trade, and the species has since outcompeted all native animals for vital resources.\n\nThe result has been a 99% decline in raccoon and opossum populations, and an 88% drop in bobcats. Marsh rabbits, cottontail rabbits, and foxes have disappeared from the state altogether, according to the U.S. Geological Survey.\n\nFlorida's climate allows the pythons to survive for years, whereas states that have a colder winter would be inhospitable. As average daily temperatures increase around the globe due to pollution, though, the range of areas where Burmese pythons could survive and reproduce could expand farther into the country.\n\nThe drops in biodiversity caused by invasive species incur a steep loss in ecosystem services. Some studies have suggested that over the course of 50 years, invasive species have created costs of over a trillion dollars globally.\n\nFlorida has invested millions in eradicating Burmese pythons. Some partners have been attempting to commercialize the activity by harvesting snakeskins and making finished products with them.\n\nIf you're interested in combating invasive species in your area, it's possible to take local action with volunteer groups that work to remove offending fauna and flora, and introduce a greater range of native species.\n\nDo you worry about companies drilling too deep into the ground?\n\nClick your choice to see results and speak your mind.\n\nGet TCD's free newsletters for easy tips to save more, waste less, and make smarter choices — and earn up to $5,000 toward clean upgrades in TCD's exclusive Rewards Club.",

    "fullText": "A hot mic before Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s Monday press conference picked up an unexpectedly candid glimpse into how some TSA agents actually feel about their jobs.\n\nThe audio captured one of the agents complaining about being “scared” of his superior before the event at Tampa International Airport in Florida, where Noem presented over a dozen TSA agents with $10,000 bonus checks for working without pay during the government shutdown.\n\n“I used to be terrified of [her] when I started in HR, I was so scared of her,” a TSA agent could be heard saying in a video shared by reporter Alexander Willis to X. “She was just really busy; she did, like, discipline stuff in HR, so being an officer, she didn’t trust me to be around any of it because she didn’t know if I had a big mouth or not.”\n\nThe agent does not reveal the colleague’s identity.\n\nThat agent, along with another, also complained about how busy their work schedules were.\n\n“Now you can no longer go to the store,” they could be heard saying. “I wish I had Sunday-Monday or Friday-Saturday [off], because having both weekend days off is great, but it’s frustrating sometimes.”\n\nThe TSA, which falls under Noem’s DHS, was hit hard by October’s government shutdown—the longest in American history—which resulted from Democrats’ refusal to sign a spending bill that didn’t guarantee an extension to Affordable Care Act subsidies.\n\nAfter receiving only a partial paycheck at the beginning of October, TSA agents—who are classified as essential employees—worked for weeks without pay until the shutdown ended on November 12, after six Democrats broke party lines to pass a temporary spending bill.\n\nLike an earlier event in November at the Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, the “bonus checks” Noem presented to TSA employees onstage at Tampa International were not actual checks and were not given to all employees.\n\nNoem clarified that the envelopes given to the agents contained a piece of paper stating that the money would be added to their next paycheck via direct deposit. Only employees nominated by their superiors for “exemplary service” were awarded the $10,000 bonus.\n\nThe TSA employs over 50,000 transportation security officers out of its approximate 65,000 total employees.\n\nThe DHS did not immediately respond to request for comment.",

    "description": "The Fed's final meeting of 2025 is expected to see a third interest rate cut from the central bank, with investors focusing on the outlook for 2026.",
    "fullText": "The Federal Reserve's final meeting of the year is set to begin on Tuesday morning, Dec. 9, with the central bank scheduled to announce its final monetary policy decision at 2:00 p.m. ET on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nInvestors expect the Fed will cut rates by 0.25%, its third cut of the year, at the conclusion of its two-day meeting, with data from the CME Group showing a 90% chance the central bank will cut rates this week.\n\nAlong with its final policy decision of the year, the Fed will also publish its final Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) for 2025, which includes forecasts from Fed officials on economic growth, inflation, and interest rates for the coming years.\n\nIn September, the SEP showed the Fed's median forecasts calling for just one interest rate cut in 2026 following three reductions in 2025. Changes to this outlook will be top of mind for investors on Wednesday.\n\nInvestors will also be closely watching for further disagreement among Fed officials, as October's policy statement revealed two members of the FOMC voted against the decision to lower rates by 0.25%.\n\nThe consensus around the Federal Reserve’s policy move on Wednesday has firmed around a 25 basis point rate cut — even if the decision will be a close one, as Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger details.\n\nTraders are pricing in an 89% chance that the Fed lowers interest rates by 25 basis points at the conclusion of the FOMC meeting on Wednesday, according to CMEGroup's FedWatch.\n\nBut looking ahead to the January meeting and 2026 broadly, the path is even less certain.\n\nOne widely held view is that the Fed will move forward with a \"hawkish cut\" on Wednesday, in which the central bank lowers rates but hints at a pause in January, JPMorgan’s Michael Feroli wrote in a Dec. 5 note. Traders have put a 23% probability that the Federal Reserve will continue cutting rates at its Jan. 27-28 meeting.\n\n“At the press conference, we expect that Powell will stress that with policy rates close to neutral, the time for risk management cuts is past and that further cuts would only come with a material deterioration in the labor market,” Feroli wrote.\n\n\"We don’t expect him to comment directly on January,\" Feroli added, \"but instead to highlight that there is a lot of data to be released between now and the January meeting and that will guide their decision.\"\n\nFor the remainder of the year, views range from the Fed cutting rates at its next few policy meetings due to a deterioration in the labor market to additional rate cuts in the summer due to a change in Fed leadership.\n\nRead more about 2026 predictions for Federal Reserve policy here.\n\nThe Federal Reserve's eventful 2025 wraps up this week, and another 0.25% rate cut is expected.\n\nBut the real drama in the central bank's release will be in how much agreement, or not, there is with this decision.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger noted in her preview of the event, at least three regional Fed presidents have signaled that the case for cutting rates this week does not appear obvious. One of those includes Kansas City Fed president Jeff Schmid, who voted against October's rate cut.\n\nAdd in that Fed Governor Stephen Miran has twice dissented in favor of a larger rate cut, the central bank could be looking at upward of four votes against the expected decision to lower rates by another 0.25% on Wednesday.\n\nRead Jennifer's full preview of the meeting here.",

    "fullText": "Microsoft's stock experienced volatility after some AI sellers made a headline-grabbing claim that the company failed to meet its aggressive goals and, as a result, reset growth targets.\n\nMicrosoft says the story went too far. It has thus far maintained its double-digit gains this year, but any disruption in its AI narrative could result in significant declines.\n\nOn a separate but equally important note for investors, it provided dates and amounts for a significant Microsoft 365 price hike that will begin generating revenue in the middle of 2026.\n\nIf you're keeping score at home, there is a lot of discussion about \"AI quotas\" in the short term and a lot of clarification about ARPU in the medium term. That tension is what MSFT is set up for at the end of the year.\n\nMorgan Stanley's 2025 CIO survey report explains, according to Barron's.\n\nNo one can dispute this. However, it appears that there may be certain areas where a snag could occur, potentially derailing Microsoft's AI ambitions.\n\nSeveral Microsoft sales teams missed aggressive growth goals for Azure Foundry and agentic AI, resulting in resets, according to a report from The Information. The stock price swung due to the speculation.\n\nMicrosoft responded by asserting that it had not reduced aggregate quotas. This information is crucial for investors who are monitoring demand signals.\n\nThe bigger picture: \"Agents\" in the early cycle need data plumbing, governance, and change management. Even when budgets are in excellent shape, sales cycles are often longer.\n\nMicrosoft released official information saying that the list prices for Microsoft 365 commercial products will go up on July 1, 2026. The same day, Microsoft 365 Government will also get an update. That's not just a guess; it's from the company.\n\nThe new grid that many customers are interested in: Business Basic costs $7 per user per month; Business Standard costs $14; Frontline F1 costs $3, and F3 costs $10; Enterprise E3 costs $39, and E5 costs $60.\n\nMicrosoft linked the lift to more than 1,100 new features, security updates, and built-in AI.\n\nEffective date: July 1, 2026, for commercial and government suites.\n\nSmall-business and frontline tiers: Steeper percentage increases than enterprise tiers.\n\nRationale: Expanded security and management features, plus AI capabilities.\n\nBusiness Basic: $7 per user per month\n\nHere's why the price change is more important than short-term volatility in shares:\n\nMicrosoft Cloud made $49.1 billion in the first quarter of fiscal year 2026, which was a 26% increase from the same time last year.\n\nRemaining performance obligation for businesses: $392 billion, a 51% increase.\n\nSegments: Microsoft 365 continued to help Productivity and Business Processes; Azure's Intelligent Cloud helped; Windows and search helped More Personal Computing.\n\nThe board announced a quarterly dividend of 91 cents per share, which will be paid on March 12, 2026.\n\nIt's line-of-sight ARPU, so call it that — a broad price increase that has been in place for a while and is now starting to show up for many customers as fiscal 2027 begins.\n\nIn the near future, there will be more news stories about the problems that come with using AI.\n\nAll sellers of \"agents\" are having trouble proving their worth. That's normal for workflow resets, not a drop in demand.\n\nIs Nvidia’s AI boom already priced in? Oppenheimer doesn’t think so\n\nWindows president told ‘Stop this nonsense. No one wants this’\n\nMichael Burry turns up heat on anti-AI bet\n\nIn the medium term, integrating Copilot into existing Microsoft 365 seats should be a more efficient way to generate revenue than building new agents from scratch.\n\nThe updated Microsoft 365 projections provide investors with a clearer picture of their potential returns through mid-2026 and fiscal 2027, regardless of the pace of agentic AI adoption.\n\nPenetration of Copilot across the Microsoft 365 user base, which is measured as paid seats relative to active seats.\n\nAzure AI usage (workload and usage mix).\n\nBefore the price increase in July 2026, renewal behavior may include locking in partner rates to maintain low rates.\n\nThe quota flap makes it clear that agentic AI is not a switch but a multi-quarter adoption curve. But Microsoft gave monetization a deadline that most consumers can't ignore.\n\nThat's the harsh fact behind the 2026 price change, and it's the portion of the model that doesn't rely on every AI pilot becoming a hero deployment on time.",

    "description": "As Warren Buffett approaches retirement, Berkshire Hathaway announced a slew of new roles for some of its most important executives.",
    "fullText": "Berkshire Hathaway is reshuffling its top ranks ahead of the departure of its legendary CEO, Warren Buffett, in January.\n\nThe company announced on Monday that Todd Combs, one of Buffett's key deputies and CEO of Berkshire-owned Geico, is departing the company to take on a role at JPMorgan.\n\nAlongside Combs' departure, Berkshire Hathaway announced a series of new leadership appointments.\n\nThe company said that the new leaders are \"stewards of the company's culture, demonstrate strong business acumen and judgment, and enable Berkshire's distinctive way of operating.\"\n\nThe shake-up of Berkshire Hathaway's top ranks comes weeks before Greg Abel is due to take over from Warren Buffett as CEO in January. 95-year-old Buffett will remain as chairman of the business that he has led for the past 60 years.\n\nHere's the full list of appointments, most of which are effective immediately, according to Berkshire Hathaway's Monday announcement.\n\nNancy Pierce is succeeding Todd Combs as CEO of Geico, the auto insurer owned by Berkshire Hathaway and one of the conglomerate's core subsidiaries.\n\nPierce joined Geico in 1986 and was chief operating officer of the company before being tapped as CEO. She has held leadership roles across claims, underwriting, product management, and regional operations.\n\n\"Nancy knows the business inside and out. She's practical, decisive, and focused on results,\" said Ajit Jain, vice chairman for insurance operations.\n\nAdam Johnson has been appointed president of Berkshire Hathaway's consumer products, service, and retailing businesses.\n\nJohnson has been CEO of the Berkshire-owned private jet company NetJets for over 10 years — a role he'll continue alongside the new appointment.\n\n\"Adam is an accomplished leader with a proven ability to deliver long-term shareholder value,\" said Abel, Berkshire's incoming CEO, in Monday's press release.\n\n\"In his new role, he will support the outstanding CEOs of our 32 consumer products, service, and retailing businesses, and uphold Berkshire's culture and values.\"\n\nJohnson's new role hints at Abel's plans for Berkshire. Under Buffett, the incoming CEO oversaw all non-insurance businesses.\n\nThe new CEO is splitting up the non-insurance businesses owned by the company.\n\nJohnson will be in charge of consumer firms like See's Candies and Fruit of the Loom, while Abel will manage the rest, including BNSF Railway, BHE, Pilot, and McLane, alongside his CEO duties.\n\nMarc Hamburg, the long-serving senior vice president and chief financial officer of Berkshire Hathaway, will retire on June 1, 2027.\n\nNow 75 years old, Hamburg joined Berkshire in 1987.\n\nHamburg's role was to oversee the conglomerate's finances. The company hit a record $1 trillion market value in August 2024 and is currently valued at $1.09 trillion.\n\n\"Marc has been indispensable to Berkshire and to me. His integrity and judgment are priceless. He has done more for this company than many of our shareholders will ever know,\" said Buffett in Monday's press release.\n\n\"His impact has been extraordinary.\"\n\nStepping into Hamburg's shoes when he retires in June 2027 is Charles Chang.\n\nChang has been a senior vice president and chief financial officer of Berkshire Hathaway Energy since 2024, and will take over as finance chief of Berkshire. He will be based in Omaha.\n\nChang is a former partner at the Big Four professional services firm PwC, where he developed over three decades of experience in public company financial reporting and mergers and acquisitions for some of PwC's largest clients.\n\nA new position has been created for Michael O'Sullivan when he joins Berkshire on January 1, 2026.\n\nO'Sullivan will become senior vice president and general counsel at Berkshire and will be based in Omaha.

    "title": "23 books you should read before they're turned into movies next year",
    "description": "Classics and new favorites like \"Wuthering Heights,\" \"Verity,\" and \"Sunrise on the Reaping\" are set for cinematic releases in 2026.",
    "fullText": "Any booklover knows that news of an adaptation can be complicated: Can we trust the directors, screenwriters, and actors to bring our favorite stories to life?\n\nNext year's movie slate is filled with books that are near and dear to thousands of readers, including classics that are hundreds of years old, like \"Sense and Sensibility,\" \"The Odyssey,\" and \"Wuthering Heights.\"\n\nThere are also some new classics set to be adapted next year, like \"Project Hail Mary\" and \"The Dog Stars.\"\n\nWe've compiled a list of 23 must-read books that you should crack open before they're adapted next year.\n\n\"People We Meet on Vacation\" (or \"PWMOV\"), by Emily Henry, was immediately beloved by BookTok after it was published in 2021. The film adaptation premieres on Netflix on January 9.\n\nThe story follows Poppy and Alex, two longtime friends who made a pact after graduating from college to take a vacation together once a year — and they did, until something happened on a trip to Croatia that caused them to stop speaking for years. The book jumps back and forth in time between Poppy and Alex's past vacations and their current reunion in Palm Springs.\n\nThe movie stars Emily Bader and Tom Blyth as Poppy and Alex, respectively, with a supporting cast of Sarah Catherine Hook, Jameela Jamil, Lucien Laviscount, Lukas Gage, Alan Ruck, and Molly Shannon.\n\n\"Box Hill,\" a 2020 novel written by Adam Mars-Jones, is being turned into the film \"Pillion,\" which will be released in theaters on February 6.\n\nThe book (and film) follows Colin, a gay man, who becomes involved in a relationship with Ray, his polar opposite. While Colin is shy, introverted, and even a bit timid, Ray is confident and controlling.\n\nThe film stars Harry Melling as Colin and Alexander Skarsgård as Ray.\n\nIf you somehow escaped high school without reading Emily Brontë's 1847 gothic classic \"Wuthering Heights,\" now is the perfect time to tick it off your reading list, ahead of its newest film adaptation releasing on February 13.\n\nThe film stars Margot Robbie and Jacob Elordi as doomed lovers Catherine and Heathcliff, who are torn apart by societal expectations, time, illness, resentment, and guilt.\n\nBut since this is an Emerald Fennell movie (director of \"Saltburn\" and \"Promising Young Woman\"), you shouldn't expect a run-of-the-mill book-to-film adaptation.\n\n\"Broken\" is a 2020 collection of six novellas written by famed author Don Winslow. One of its short stories, \"Crime 101,\" has been adapted into a film that hits theaters on February 13.\n\nThe story takes its title from California's iconic Highway 101, which runs from Los Angeles all the way up to the California-Portland border.\n\nIn it, a master jewel thief named Mike Davis perfectly executes heists up and down the 101 with an elite crew, but Detective Lou Lubesnick is on his tail.\n\nChris Hemsworth and Mark Ruffalo play Mike and Lou respectively, while the rest of the cast is filled out by Barry Keoghan, Halle Berry, Monica Barbaro, Corey Hawkins, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Nick Nolte, and more.\n\n\"Cold Storage\" is the third book adaptation that will be released on February 13. It's based on David Koepp's 2019 novel of the same name and follows a trio of unlikely friends who team up to stop a mutant killing machine from ending the world.\n\nIt stars Joe Keery, Georgina Campbell, and Liam Neeson.\n\nThe first of two Colleen Hoover books to hit the big screen in 2026 is \"Reminders of Him,\" which was published in 2022. The film will be released on March 13.\n\nLike all Hoover's books, this story deals with heavy themes, including alcoholism, death, life after incarceration, grief, and redemption — and, of course, romance.\n\nThe story follows Kenna, a young woman who is released from prison after seven years and is desperately trying to get her life back and reconnect with her daughter, Diem. The story flashes back and forth in time to show how Kenna ended up in prison after the death of her boyfriend, Scotty, and how she's finding new love with Scotty's best friend, Ledger.\n\nMaika Monroe, Tyriq Withers, and Rudy Pankow play Kenna, Ledger, and Scotty, respectively, while Scotty's parents are played by Lauren Graham and Bradley Whitford.\n\nAndy Weir, author of the beloved novel \"The Martian,\" published \"Project Hail Mary\" in 2021 to critical acclaim. Five years later, the story of astronaut Ryland Grace, played by another RG (Ryan Gosling), is coming to cinemas on March 20.\n\nThe story begins with Ryland waking up aboard a spaceship with no memory of who he is or how he got there. From there, we flash back to learn that Ryland is a science teacher who was recruited for this mission to save the human race, as our sun is dying.\n\nPeople love this book — and love its directors Christopher Miller and Phil Lord, the brains behind \"Into the Spider-Verse\" and \"21 Jump Street\" — so the hype is high for this one.\n\n\"The Dog Stars,\" written by Peter Heller, was published in 2012. It takes place in a post-apocalyptic society with the survivors of a flu-like pandemic. It follows a pilot living an isolated existence in Colorado with just one other (quite bitter) person for company. But when he hears a mysterious signal over his plane's radio while flying one day, he resolves to seek out its source.\n\nThe film adaptation, directed by Ridley Scott and starring Jacob Elordi and Josh Brolin, will be released on March 27.\n\nYes, it's exactly what it sounds like: \"Three Bags Full,\" a German novel written in 2006 by Leonie Swann, focuses on a flock of sheep who become determined to solve the murder of their beloved shepherd, George.\n\nThe adaptation, which has been retitled \"The Sheep Detectives,\" stars Hugh Jackman as George, while his flock of sheep are voiced by Bryan Cranston, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Chris O'Dowd, Regina Hall, and Patrick Stewart.\n\nHomer's epic poem has been translated from Homeric Greek a great many times since it was first translated in the 1500s.\n\nBut director Christopher Nolan told Empire Magazine that he was specifically working off Emily Wilson's translation, published in 2017, so that's the one we'll recommend, too.\n\nIf it's been a minute since you dusted off your Greek mythology gap, \"The Odyssey\" follows Odysseus, the king of Ithaca, on his decadeslong journey to return home after the Trojan War. Along the way, he meets some of the most iconic monsters, legends, and gods in the Greek canon, including the Cyclops, Circe, the Sirens, Athena, and more.\n\nThe film hits theaters on July 17, though tickets at some theaters are already sold out.\n\nMaybe you could've guessed from the cover, but \"The Book of Magic,\" written by Alice Hoffman, is the long-awaited sequel to her novel \"Practical Magic.\" The first book was published in 1995, and 26 years later, Hoffman published its follow-up in 2021.\n\nThe film adaptations will have a similarly long gap. \"Practical Magic\" was released in theaters in 1998, and its sequel, \"Practical Magic 2,\" will be released on September 18.\n\nSandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman are back as the witchy Owens sisters, as are Stockard Channing and Dianne Wiest as their magical aunts. Newcomers to the cast include Joey King, Xolo Maridueña, Maisie Williams, and Lee Pace.\n\nThirty years after \"Sense and Sensibility\" was adapted by Emma Thompson and Ang Lee, the 1811 novel by Jane Austen will once again return to the silver screen, this time starring Daisy Edgar-Jones, Esmé Creed-Miles, Caitríona Balfe, Frank Dillane, Herbert Nordrum, and George MacKay, on September 25.\n\n\"Sense and Sensibility\" is the tale of the Dashwood sisters, who are left penniless after their half-brother and his wife take almost all of their inheritance from their father. While Elinor (Edgar-Jones) tries to be practical, her younger sister Marianne (Creed-Miles) is determined to, as the kids say, romanticize her life.\n\n\"Verity\" is the second Colleen Hoover adaptation of 2026, though it couldn't be more different from \"Reminders of Him.\"\n\n\"Verity,\" published in 2018, is easily Hoover's darkest book. It follows Lowen Ashleigh, a writer struggling to get by, who by chance gets hired to take over as the ghost writer for the now-comatose Verity Crawford. But when Lowen begins looking over Verity's manuscript, she soon wonders if she's reading a disturbing work of fiction, or a confession of heinous crimes.\n\nThe adaptation stars Dakota Johnson as Lowen, Anne Hathaway as Verity, and Josh Hartnett as Verity's husband Jeremy. It will come to theaters on October 2.\n\nThis one isn't for the faint of heart. \"Incidents Around the House,\" written by Josh Malerman in 2024, is about an 8-year-old girl, Bela, who is terrorized by a mysterious entity she calls Other Mommy.\n\nFittingly, the adaptation, which comes to big screens on October 9, has a new title: \"Other Mommy.\" It stars Jessica Chastain, Jay Duplass, Dichen Lachman, and Arabella Olivia Clark as Bela.\n\nNo, it's not a particularly random game of MadLibs — director M. Night Shyamalan and romance author Nicholas Sparks teamed up to write the novel \"Remain,\" which was published earlier this year.\n\n\"Remain\" is the story of architect Tate Donovan, who retreats to a bed-and-breakfast in Cape Cod after the death of his mother. Before long, he bonds with a mysterious resident of the small town named Wren. But, as this is a Shyamalan story, all is not what it seems.\n\nThe film, which stars Jake Gyllenhaal and Phoebe Dynevor as Tate and Wren, will be released in theaters on October 23.\n\nFor years, fans begged \"Hunger Games\" author Suzanne Collins to tell the story of Haymitch Abernathy's games. In March 2025, she obliged, publishing \"Sunrise on the Reaping,\" a \"Hunger Games\" prequel that takes place 24 years before the first novel.\n\nIt tells the story of the 25th Hunger Games, which Haymitch, the future tribute mentor for District 12, won. As with all \"Hunger Games\" books, it's devastating.\n\n\"The Hunger Games: Sunrise on the Reaping,\" which boasts an all-star cast of Mckenna Grace, Jesse Plemons, Ralph Fiennes, Glenn Close, Kieran Culkin, Elle Fanning, Billy Porter, Maya Hawke, Lili Taylor, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Whitney Peak, and newcomer Joseph Zada as Haymitch, will be in theaters on November 20.\n\nAfter the two-part adaptation of \"Dune,\" the third film in the series is set to take on Frank Herbert's second novel in the series, \"Dune Messiah,\" published in 1969.\n\nPicking up after the events of \"Dune: Part Two,\" \"Dune: Part Three\" will follow Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) as he struggles to control the galaxy, prevent the death of millions, avenge his father, and juggle relationships with Princess Irulan (Florence Pugh) and his love Chani (Zendaya). It's set to be released on December 18.\n\nWe've reached the part of the list where the adaptations don't have official release dates, but it's a safe bet that they'll come out at some point in 2026.\n\nFirst up is Ali Hazelwood's \"The Love Hypothesis,\" originally published in 2021, after originally being posted on the internet as \"Star Wars\" fan fiction.\n\nIt's about a young PhD student, Olive, who, after a series of mishaps, is forced to fake-date a faculty member at her university: Dr. Adam Carlsen. You can guess what happens.\n\nThe film will star Lili Reinhart as Olive and Tom Bateman as Adam — and fans are already frothing at the mouth after Reinhart's TikToks from set went viral.\n\nThis 2017 novel written by Liv Constantine tells the tale of Amber Patterson, a scammer with a plan to take over the life of rich, beautiful socialite Daphne Parrish.\n\nThe film, directed by Robert Zemeckis and starring Isabel May as Amber, Jennifer Lopez as Daphne, and Nikolaj Coster-Waldau as Daphne's husband, Jackson, is expected to hit Netflix at some point next year.\n\nAnd if that's not enough, there's always the sequel, \"The Next Mrs. Parrish.\"\n\nSarah Hogle wrote \"You Deserve Each Other\" in 2020. The novel is about Nicholas and Naomi, an engaged couple who are the furthest thing from soon-to-be-newlywed bliss. In fact, they're in a game of chicken to see who can call off the wedding (and be stuck with the nonrefundable deposits) first.\n\nThe film adaptation will star Meghann Fahy and Penn Badgley as Naomi and Nick, with a supporting cast of Natalie Morales, Justin Long, Kyle MacLachlan, and Ana Gasteyer. It's not yet known if it will head straight to Prime Video or get a theatrical run.\n\nNine years after his last directorial effort, Deadline reported that Tom Ford is going to adapt Anne Rice's 1982 novel \"Cry to Heaven,\" with an aimed release date of fall 2026.\n\nThe novel follows a student and teacher in 18th-century Italy: Tonio Treschi and Guido Maffeo.\n\nWhile we don't know who is playing whom yet, the announced cast is already iconic: Nicholas Hoult, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Ciarán Hinds, Colin Firth, Mark Strong, George MacKay, Paul Bettany, Hunter Schafer, Thandiwe Newton, and, making her acting debut, Adele.\n\nParamount acquired the rights to adapt Rebecca Serle's 2022 novel \"One Italian Summer\" in 2023, per Variety, but for over two years there was no news.\n\nThat is until a throwaway line in a December 2025 Hollywood Reporter piece about David Ellison's takeover of Paramount mentioned that the project would be moving forward starring Brie Larson.\n\nThe novel is about Katy, a 30-something woman mourning the death of her mother and best friend, Carol. As the two had planned a luxurious Italian vacation before Carol's death, Katy decides to take the trip herself to try to reconnect with her mother's spirit, but she gets a bit more than she asked for when she seemingly meets a younger version of her mom on the beach.\n\nNetflix announced that Katherine Center's novel \"The Bodyguard,\" published in 2022, will be adapted for the streamer — and while no release date has been set, since the film takes place around the holidays, we can assume a November or December release date is in the cards.\n\nThe story follows Jack Stapleton, a famous actor with a stalker, who hires bodyguard Hannah Brooks, to protect him. But since he doesn't want to worry his sick mother, the two instead pretend to date.\n\nThe catch with this adaptation? Since there's already a quite famous film called \"The Bodyguard,\" Netflix, along with stars Leighton Meester and Jared Padalecki, are asking fans to come up with a new name for the film.",

    "description": "YouTuber MKBHD recently tested the Xiaomi SU7 Max. He praised its various features and low price tag. Ford CEO Jim Farley is a fan of it too.",
    "fullText": "The Chinese electric vehicles continue to make waves in the US — even if you can't buy them. One of the most influential tech critics just gave his stamp of approval.\n\nYouTuber Marques Brownlee, who goes by MKBHD, drove a Xiaomi SU7 Max for two weeks. The EV retails for 299,000 Chinese yuan, or about $42,000. Compare that to a Tesla Model 3 Performance, which retails at just under $55,000.\n\nThe verdict? MKBHD was blown away.\n\n\"This feels nothing like a $42,000 car,\" he said. \"This is a nice car.\"\n\nWalking around the EV, MKBHD compared it to a variety of other vehicles, including a Polestar and Mercedes. It looked a bit like a Porsche Taycan, he said, and had a Porsche-like steering wheel.\n\nInside, MKBHD called the software \"so good.\" It looked like what Apple would have done if the company made a car, he said.\n\nMKBHD was particularly impressed with the vehicle's accessory mounting points. Drivers can add additional gadgets like a speedometer, magnetic phone mount, charger, microphone, or walkie-talkie.\n\n\"What other car does this?\" he asked. \"I've never seen the ability to customize just how much hardware, or how little hardware, you have in the interior layout like Xiaomi does.\"\n\nTaking it for a drive, MKBHD said that it was a \"really capable car,\" comparing it to a Tesla Model 3 or a BMW I4.\n\n\"This is a $42,000 car that feels like a $75,000 car,\" he added.\n\nLike other Chinese EVs, the Xiaomi Speed Ultra 7 is not available in the United States, although more Americans have been going to great lengths to drive them. Ford CEO Jim Farley said in October that he loved the EV.\n\n\"We flew one from Shanghai to Chicago, and I've been driving it for six months now, and I don't want to give it up,\" Farley said on \"The Fully Charged Podcast.\"\n\nXiaomi is in many more industries than EVs. The company sells phones, robot vacuums, and more. Its EV division recently posted its first profit, a rarity for the industry.\n\nSpeaking to the question of what would happen if Chinese EVs were ever offered in the US, MKBHD asked: \"Are we cooked?\"\n\nNot yet, he said — because they're not available. That international crossover is muddled by political conflict, he said.\n\n\"We may never get a car like this available in the US for $42,000,\" he said, citing tariffs and import fees.\n\nHowever, other markets will soon face the competition. Xiaomi's EVs are headed to Europe in 2027, the company's president said on an August earnings call.\n\nEurope could prove a helpful battleground for Xiaomi. While the Chinese EV company sets up shop, American producers like Tesla faced challenges in the market. European Tesla sales were down an estimated 48.5% year over year in October, according to data from the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association.\n\n\"It raises the ceiling for all cars to get better, more impressive, and more complete,\" MKBHD said.",

    "title": "Cuyana's bags are the benchmark for quiet luxury —  here's why they're worth the investment",
    "description": "We reviewed the Cuyana Easy Tote, System Tote, Mila Satchel, Forma Satchel, and Double Loop Satchel. Here's why they we keep coming back to the brand.",
    "fullText": "We've tested lots of bags over the years. In fact, I would estimate that our team has probably tested close to a hundred totes, if not more. So when we say that we love Cuyana, we mean it.\n\nThe brand is known for functional bags made of high-quality leather. Many of its totes and satchels are also compatible with snap-in bag organizers, which you can purchase separately. The leather is soft, wears nicely, and holds its shape.\n\nThe only issue with Cuyana is that the bags are relatively expensive — mostly retailing for $300 and up. But if it's in your budget, we recommend splurging a little since the totes and satchels will last you a long time. Ours have held up over the years and still look great.\n\nFor more of our rigorously tested bag coverage, see our articles on the best work bags for women, the best tote bags, the best convertible backpack totes, and more.\n\nWho it's perfect for: People who want a soft leather tote bag that's versatile enough for work, travel, and general schlepping.\n\nWho should skip it: Those who prefer their totes to have structure.\n\nCuyana's Classic Easy Tote is our top pick for the best tote bag because it's chic, durable, flexible but not floppy, and can fit a huge amount of stuff. And though it looks like a basic tote at first glance, there are actually a ton of thoughtful details that have gone into the design of the bag. Two sets of straps mean you can carry the tote like a handbag, or you can use the longer set of straps to throw it over your shoulder. Internally, there is a small pocket for things you need to grab frequently, and there's a tie you can use to close the bag up a little more if you want.\n\nCuyana also makes several accessories, like the Classic Tote Insert, for organizing the interior of your bag. These are great if you like a bit more structure or interior protection since the soft Italian leather is unlined inside. I've had my bag for about four years now and I've taken it on every vacation, flight, weekend trip, and long car ride in that time. It fits an unbelievable amount of stuff, but it also doesn't look floppy or silly if I just put a few things in it.\n\nOn a usual vacation, this bag will hold two pairs of shoes, my giant Dyson blow dryer, a hair brush, my toiletry and makeup bags, a scarf or sweater, and a couple of snacks. I use the interior tie to keep it closed when I have to shove it under my seat on a plane, but they also make a zippered version of the Easy Tote if you prefer the added security. Just note that you may not be able to shove quite as much stuff in it if you wanted to zip it closed. —Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews.\n\nOther versions of the Easy Tote\n\nWho it's perfect for: People who want custom organizational features, like the option to pick between an internal zippered pouch or a flap pouch and the ability to snap in or remove a laptop sleeve.\n\nWho should skip it: Those who want a lightweight tote, since the organizational features make it heavier.\n\nThe Cuyana 13-inch System Tote is easily one of the most versatile totes out there. The bag itself is relatively simple in design, with seamless top handles that fit tightly around your shoulder and a small internal pocket. But it also comes with internal D-rings that allow you to attach a cross-body strap, and you can snap in one of Cuyana's tote organizers for extra customizability.\n\nThe leather is extremely supple, and it softens over time with use, so don't expect this to be a super structured bag. If you're deciding between the 13-inch and 16-inch options, I would go with the larger style. I've tested the smaller one and my only complaint has been that I wish it were roomier. The brand introduced the larger one later on to solve that problem! — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews.\n\nYou can also get other versions of the System Tote, like:\n\nWho it's perfect for: Stylish corporate folks who want a work tote that looks like a chic (and very trendy for fall) hobo bag.\n\nWho should skip it: People who want their tote to double as a carry-on, since the top doesn't zip.\n\nEqual parts stylish and functional, Cuyana's Double Loop Satchel is a splurge, but I believe it's worth every penny.\n\nIt has an elegant, unique silhouette that resembles an oversized shoulder bag more so than a traditional tote bag. If you're going right from work to happy hour, this is a perfect way to look professional but not stuffy.\n\nPlus, the interior and exterior pockets are relatively minimalist. There are two exterior magnetic pockets on either side that are perfect for stashing small go-tos like a packet of tissues or my iPhone. The inside of the bag is pretty simple in design: there's an open laptop pocket that can hold a computer up to 14 inches (a 16-inch laptop can fit in the main compartment) plus one zippered pocket.\n\nYou can also add more compartments. If you prefer some more organizational features (like I do), you can snap on a System Flap Bag (sold separately) to add another magnetic interior pocket. Though it's an extra cost, I feel it's worth it since the System Flap Bag can be detached and used as a clutch — or you can purchase a strap for it to turn it into a small crossbody tote. — Talia Ergas, freelance style writer.\n\nWho it's perfect for: People who need a larger bag for all of their work essentials, since the bag can fit a 16-inch laptop with tons of room to spare.\n\nWho should skip it: People who want a lightweight tote that they can sling over their shoulder.\n\nThis sophisticated satchel from Cuyana is crafted from materials that would impress any leather nerd. The full-grain, Italian pebbled leather is luxe and touchable. We've been testing Cuyana for years, so we know firsthand that the brand's leather ages beautifully. And besides, the material just looks expensive.\n\nI also love the option to transform this oversized tote into a chic purse-like shape. The collapsible sides make it a versatile work travel tote since they can be folded out for plane rides and in for client meetings.\n\nAs always, Cuyana has delivered a bag with tons of sophistication on the outside and heaps of practicality on the inside. The bag can snap in the same pouches and zippered pockets as the System Tote, but it also has a built-in divider and three internal pockets.\n\nOne issue I have with this tote is how heavy it is. The Forma Satchel weighs 3.6 pounds, which is definitely on the heftier side. I've tested dozens of totes for my article on the best work bags for women, and I've preferred bags that are 2.5 pounds or under. Much of this extra weight is due to the bag's thick, quality leather — but it still feels a little too heavy sometimes.\n\nThe other issue I've encountered is the length of the handles. Beware that this is not a bag that you can easily sling over your shoulder. The handles are top handles, so you carry it on your forearm or in your hands, which is sometimes awkward and difficult with a bag this large. You can buy an adjustable shoulder or crossbody strap, but it will be an extra cost. — Samatha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews.\n\nWho it's perfect for: People who travel a lot for work and need a professional-looking bag that can double as a work tote and a functional carry-on. It would be especially great for those who frequently take day or overnight trips for their jobs since it's just big enough for your work essentials and an extra outfit.\n\nWho should skip it: People looking for a compact tote that just fits their laptop and some essentials. Also, people on a budget since this is one of the more expensive picks.\n\nThis bag is bigger than a typical tote but smaller than a weekender. It has many work bag features, like a laptop slot that fits a computer up to 14 inches and a place to snap in Cuyana's signature organizational inserts. But it also has travel features, like a luggage sleeve that has a zipper at the bottom so that you can turn it into an outer pocket.\n\nBecause of the sleek look, functional pockets, and travel-friendly details, this would make a great work travel companion. It can easily double as a functional carry-on and a professional work satchel.\n\nThe Mila Satchel comes with a long strap so that you can sling the bag over your shoulder. The strap is adjustable and thick enough that it won't dig in. I use this strap a lot since it can be awkward to carry such a large bag with just the top handles. Sometimes, I wish the top handles were longer so that I could carry the bag on my shoulders without having to use the long strap. —Samatha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews.\n\nWho it's perfect for: People who travel a lot and want an elevated way to pack their makeup and accessories.\n\nWho should skip it: Anyone who wants more of a toiletry bag, since these aren't waterproof, won't protect against spills, and can't be taken into the shower.\n\nThis travel case duo is a beautifully elevated way to tote your makeup and accessories. Both cases have a large opening, so you won't have to go digging for a lip liner — but despite the large opening, they both have a slim profile and a sleek look.\n\nWhen I went to Greece, I had planned to use the larger case as a makeup bag. But once I started filling it, I realized that even I (with my habit of bringing at least five lip colors to match all my outfits) couldn't fill it. I switched to the smaller case for makeup and was amazed that it could fit everything I needed.\n\nSo I turned the larger case into a plane pouch for my carry-on and loved it. It fit a pill box, an eye mask, a tube of moisturizer, a contact case, compression socks, and everything else I needed for the flight. I loved carrying everything in a chic leather pouch, and I'm definitely going to keep using it as a catch-all for car rides and plane trips in the future.\n\nThe only things I wouldn't use this for are liquids like shampoo and soap. The leather is beautiful, but not leakproof or water-resistant. Stick with less fancy nylon and plastic-based pouches for anything that leaks. —Samatha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews.",

    "title": "Meet David Ellison, the 42-year-old Paramount Skydance CEO trying to throw a monkey wrench in Netflix's plan",
    "description": "David Ellison is officially chairman and CEO of Paramount Skydance after an $8 billion tie-up. Next on his wish list: Warner Bros Discovery.",
    "fullText": "David Ellison is officially the CEO of Paramount Skydance. After a successful Paramount merger, next on his wish list is Warner Bros. Discovery — and he's launched a hostile takeover bid in an effort to scoop it out from Netflix's hands.\n\nThe 42-year-old founded Skydance back in 2006 with some help from his father Larry Ellison, the Oracle cofounder who's worth $277 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nSince then, Skydance has enjoyed considerable success with films including \"Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol\" and \"Baywatch,\" and a total box office haul of more than $8 billion. The merger deal valued Skydance at $4.75 billion.\n\nIts biggest hit has been \"Top Gun: Maverick,\" which became the second-highest-grossing film of 2022 after making almost $1.5 billion worldwide.\n\nAfter seeing the original \"Top Gun\" as a child, David Ellison became obsessed with flying. His billionaire father bought him a plane at the age of 13 and they took flying lessons together. By 17, Ellison had begun competing in air shows performing aerial acrobatics.\n\nHe gave up flying competitively after starting a film degree at USC that he later dropped out of, Ellison told Kara Swisher in an episode of The New York Times' \"Sway\" podcast.\n\nBefore becoming an entertainment executive, though, Ellison had a brief foray as an actor.\n\nIn 2006, he appeared in a Skydance film called \"Flyboys,\" about American pilots who flew for the French Air Force in World War I.\n\nThe movie cost about $65 million, but flopped after taking just $18 million or so, per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nSince moving behind the camera, Ellison's company has had a relationship with Paramount that dates back to 2011 when Skydance co-financed Joel and Ethan Coen's \"True Grit\" with the studio.\n\nThe film was both a critical and commercial success, winning 10 Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and taking about $200 million at the box office.\n\nEllison's sister, Megan, is also in the movie game. Her production company Annapurna Pictures was behind releases including \"Zero Dark Thirty,\" \"Her,\" \"American Hustle,\" and \"Phantom Thread,\" all of which received Oscar nominations.\n\nThe $8 billion tie-up of Skydance and Paramount officially closed in August. Ellison named himself chairman and CEO of the newly combined company, Paramount Skydance.\n\nSoon after taking the helm, Ellison led Paramount Skydance through layoffs, which can be common in the wake of a merger. The company laid off 1,000 employees in October and said that more cuts were coming. Six hundred employees took severance packages and quit instead of returning to the office, it said.\n\nEllison has also installed Bari Weiss at the top of CBS News. Weiss left The New York Times Opinion section in 2020 and later built the The Free Press, which Paramount Skydance acquired for about $150 million.\n\nEllison continued his spending run. He brought in Netflix veteran Cindy Holland and shelled out $7.7 billion for UFC rights.\n\n\"Everywhere you look, he's throwing money,\" LightShed Partners media analyst Rich Greenfield told Business Insider. \"That's what Hollywood gets excited about.\"\n\nNow, Ellison has his eye on another acquisition: Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nParamount Skydance had earlier entered a competitive bid against Netflix and Comcast to acquire the company.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery ultimately accepted Netflix's bid to purchase the company's streaming and studio business for $72 billion.\n\nEllison is now fighting to stop that from happening. On December 8, Paramount Skydance launched a hostile bid for WBD, offering to pay shareholders $30 per share for the entire company.\n\nThat morning, Ellison made his case to shareholders and WBD's board on CNBC.\n\n\"We have faster regulatory certainty to close,\" Ellison said. He called the deal \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\"",

    "title": "Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to put billions into Paramount/WBD. Why?",
    "description": "Paramount's Larry and David Ellison are making a hostile bid for Warner Bros. Three of their partners are Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi.",
    "fullText": "The governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi want to invest billions of dollars into a would-be mega media conglomerate made up of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nWhat would they get for their money?\n\nSpoiler: I don't know. And Paramount, the company that wants to use the three oil nations to help finance its bid for WBD, won't say.\n\nBut it sure seems like a question worth asking, as Paramount launches a hostile bid for WBD after losing last week's auction to Netflix.\n\nParamount says the three petrostates will be part of the new bid — as they were in Paramount's previous offers for WBD (something Paramount had at one point denied).\n\nAs of a week ago, those three countries were going to kick in $24 billion — double the $11.8 billion the Ellison family planned to invest in WBD.\n\nNow, Paramount won't say how much the three countries' sovereign wealth funds plan to invest in their newest proposal. It says Larry and David Ellison, who currently own Paramount, along with RedBird Capital, the private equity group, will \"backstop\" the deal — meaning they promise to finance all of it if necessary.\n\nBut Paramount still anticipates those three countries will ultimately invest in a combined Paramount/WBD, along with Jared Kushner — Donald Trump's son-in-law, whose Affinity Partners group invests money on behalf of … Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi, among others.\n\nThe difference this time around, Paramount says, is that those countries' sovereign wealth funds won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would operate. They wouldn't get board seats, voting rights, or any other governance over the company. Paramount declined to comment.\n\nThe reason Paramount needs to stress that, apparently, is that Warner Bros. Discovery had previously flagged that as an issue. Now that the oil states won't have any say in how a combined Paramount-WBD would be run, Paramount says the deal wouldn't need approval from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a regulatory body that's supposed to sign off on foreign investments in some US companies.\n\nThat's all part of Paramount's pitch it is making to Warner Bros. Discovery shareholders: A deal for Paramount to buy WBD will pass regulators much more easily than Netflix buying WBD.\n\nBut who knows how that will actually pan out? Up until last week, the conventional wisdom was that Paramount would be the most likely winner for WBD, in no small part because Larry Ellison was a longtime Donald Trump backer, and his son, David, had been trying to curry favor with Trump as well.\n\nNow it turns out that Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos was also wooing Trump. He visited Trump at the White House, and Trump seems to have been taken with him: \"He was in the Oval Office last week. I have a lot of respect for him. He is a great person,\" Trump told reporters Sunday night. \"Ted has really done a legendary job.\"\n\nSo in a world where Donald Trump is the most important decision-maker when it comes to what American companies are allowed to do, I don't know if the niceties of CFIUS rules will be the ultimate arbiter. (Here I'll note that last year the US passed a law that required China's ByteDance to divest itself of its ownership in the US. TikTok business or shut down. That hasn't happened, and TikTok is still alive and well in the U.S.)\n\nI also don't know if Trump will particularly care that three Middle Eastern oil states could conceivably own a big chunk of a conglomerate that includes CNN, CBS, HBO, and two movie studios. He has been quite eager to do deals in the Middle East, and last month he rolled out the red carpet for the Saudi crown prince at the White House.\n\nAnd perhaps that eagerness explains why Paramount didn't think it was a big deal to include petrostate investments in the past — and why it still thinks it's OK to have them now.\n\nBut again: If Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Abu Dhabi are looking to put anything close to $24 billion into an enormously powerful media conglomerate — one with huge reach in both the US and ambitions for the rest of the world — will they be satisfied with purely financial returns? Or do they expect something else for their money?\n\nI'd love to know. Maybe you would, too.",

    "description": "President Donald Trump has brought his love of maximalism and gold furnishings to the Oval Office. His next project: a $300 million ballroom.",
    "fullText": "The Oval Office is looking a little bit different lately.\n\nEvery US president makes new interior design choices upon entering the White House, often reflecting their personal tastes or political views.\n\nIn his second nonconsecutive term, President Donald Trump has incorporated his love of maximalism and gold furnishings into the Oval Office.\n\nMore White House renovations are in the works. The East Wing was demolished in October to make way for the construction of a $200 million, 90,000-square-foot state ballroom.\n\nTake a look inside Trump's redecorated White House to see the changes he's made since former President Joe Biden left office.\n\nThe White House did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPresident Joe Biden walked through the West Colonnade alongside Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. in May 2023.\n\nTrump has criticized Biden's use of an autopen and sought to invalidate Biden's pardons and commutations that were signed with the device.\n\nThe Palm Room leads out into the Rose Garden.\n\n\"New lobby leading to Oval Office — Magnificent marble floor, compliments of President Donald J. Trump!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\nAside from a presidential seal above the door to the West Wing, the walls were empty.\n\nThe gold lettering spelling out \"The Oval Office\" was set in the Shelley Script font. Trump also added a gold decal to the top of the door.\n\nThe rug, which featured the presidential seal in the center, was designed by Kaki Hockersmith, an interior designer based in Little Rock, Arkansas.\n\nThe rug's design includes the presidential seal, a sunbeam pattern, and olive branches along the border as a symbol of peace.\n\nTrump also used the rug during his first term.\n\nTrump's Oval Office features the flags of the Army, the Marine Corps, and the Navy.\n\nThe crown molding on the ceiling matched the cream wallpaper.\n\nThe gold embellishments matched the gold curtains, which remained in place from Biden's presidency.\n\nBiden also hung portraits of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton together to symbolize the benefits of different opinions, as well as portraits of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln.\n\nTrump added more portraits with decorative frames to create an Oval Office gallery wall. He also replaced Biden's portrait of FDR with one of George Washington and displayed historic gold urns and baskets from the White House collection on the mantle.\n\nTrump's love of gold decor is well-known. His Trump Tower penthouse in New York City features numerous gilded ceilings, furniture pieces, and artwork. Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, also includes a ballroom covered in gold from floor to ceiling.\n\nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt added the plaster relief of the presidential seal to the Oval Office during a 1934 White House renovation.\n\nBoth the seal and the stars surrounding it were covered in gold paint.\n\nThe hyperrealistic portrait, painted by Robert McCurdy, was unveiled at the White House in 2023.\n\nArtist Marc Lipp painted a rendering of an Associated Press photo that captured Trump raising his fist in the air following an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore it was used for press conferences and events, first lady Ellen Wilson originally designed the outdoor space as a formal flower garden in 1913.\n\nFirst lady Melania Trump added a limestone border around the lawn in 2020.\n\nTrump told Fox News that the grass in the Rose Garden was impractical for large events because it stayed wet when it rained and was too soft for attendees who wore high heels.\n\n\"The grass just doesn't work,\" Trump told Fox News host Laura Ingraham in March.\n\nWorkers began transforming the lawn into a patio in June, replacing the grass with concrete and stone tiles. \"The Rose Garden Club\" was completed in August.\n\nThe East Room, the largest state room in the White House, has a seating capacity of 200 people. When Biden hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in 2023, he held the state dinner in a tent outside the White House to accommodate the larger crowd of over 300.\n\nThe 90,000-square-foot ballroom, which the White House called a \"much-needed and exquisite addition,\" will cost approximately $300 million to construct. Trump and other \"patriot donors\" will foot the bill for the project, the White House said.\n\nLocated in the West Wing near the Oval Office, the Cabinet Room overlooks the Rose Garden and features a large, oval-shaped mahogany table purchased by President Richard Nixon in 1970, according to Obama's archived White House website.\n\nSeating at the table is assigned in order of when each department was established, with the oldest departments sitting nearest to the president.\n\nTrump chose portraits of past presidents, including George Washington, John Adams, Andrew Jackson, James Polk, Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Dwight Eisenhower, to decorate the Cabinet Room.\n\n\"The vaults are where we have a lot of great pictures and artwork,\" Trump told reporters in July. \"And I picked it all myself, I'm very proud of it.\"\n\nThe eagle sconces were installed as part of a 2004 refurbishment of the Cabinet Room that also included a new rug, curtains, and paint color.\n\n\"Some of the highest quality 24 Karat Gold used in the Oval Office and Cabinet Room of the White House,\" Trump wrote in a Truth Social post in September. \"Foreign Leaders, and everyone else, 'freak out' when they see the quality and beauty.\"",

    "description": "Dakota Johnson's fashion is effortlessly chic. It's also pretty daring. This year, she's worn a mix of both styles on and off the red carpet.",
    "fullText": "She wore classic black Gucci trousers with sharp pleats, a semi-sheer white blouse, and shiny black loafers from the Italian fashion house.\n\nThough understated, her outfit was expensive. Her shoes cost $1,050, and her pants cost $2,500.\n\nShe wore a chic $2,980 black midi dress from Khaite on the event's red carpet, which highlighted her accessories.\n\nThe latter included $1,140 haircalf heels from the clothing brand, a $2,350 Métier bag, $695 Sophie Buhai earrings, and two onyx rings from the same designer, which cost $2,050 each.\n\nInside the gala, she wore a white trench coat with thick buckles on top.\n\nShe wore a sheer Balenciaga bodysuit on one occasion, but covered it with a leather duster jacket.\n\nShe also sported black Balenciaga jeans, $990 Khaite wedges, The Row's $2,600 Mira clutch, an assortment of Yvonne Leon diamond jewelry, and $590 sunglasses from Khaite's collaboration with Oliver Peoples.\n\nShe wore a $5,200 sleeveless black Gucci dress with a deeply scooped neckline and a crystal hook across the back for the May event.\n\nThe outfit was pretty plain, but elevated thanks to her $1,120 Gucci heels, diamond stud earrings, and a $12,750 Boucheron ring.\n\nJohnson wore a Ferragamo fit that day to deliver an acting masterclass. It included a $1,750 scarf-embellished top, a miniskirt, and sheer tights.\n\nHer $2,900 boots, though, were the most daring piece of the ensemble. Designed by Yves Saint Laurent, the leather shoes featured 6.1-inch block heels and platforms across the toes.\n\nShe arrived at the event in a custom YSL slip dress with an orange floral print. The garment was understated by Johnson's standards, though her jewelry was anything but.\n\nShe wore $115,000 Boucheron earrings made from diamonds and white gold. The statement pieces were shaped like leaves.\n\nHer dress, a $2,450 piece from Mugler, was strapless with a plunging V-shaped neckline and a long, ankle-length skirt.\n\nTo complement the gown's daring cut, Johnson wore a diamond necklace with an emerald charm from Roberto Coin and a matching emerald ring.\n\nShe completed the look for the July event with $795 Gianvito Rossi pumps.\n\nJohnson mostly wore gowns throughout 2025, but she made an exception for the \"Splitsville\" premiere after-party.\n\nThat night, she wore a green Gucci minidress covered in sequins, paired with the fashion house's pointed black pumps.\n\nWhile walking around New York City, Johnson was photographed wearing a $98 semi-sheer Commando bodysuit beneath a yellow velvet jacket from Khaite.\n\nShe also wore simple blue jeans, $990 Khaite wedges in black, and dark Gucci sunglasses.\n\nThe daring aspect came in the form of her jewelry, which retails for a combined total of over $140,000. Johnson wore a $10,430 Ophelia Eve emerald necklace and a $130,200 Sophie Bille Brahe piece.\n\nInstead, she wore a strapless, seafoam gown from Valentino. The floor-length piece was crafted from textured fabric and featured a gathered waistline.\n\nThough its silhouette was straightforward, its color was a bold choice for the actor, which paid off.\n\nShe completed the look with jewels from Jessica McCormack.\n\nShe wore a strapless, form-fitting gown from Gucci in a striking silver color.\n\nIt contrasted her dark hair and was accessorized to perfection with statement earrings and bangles, all from Roberto Coin.\n\nHer Valentino gown had a halter neckline, a black mesh panel beneath its beaded top, and a floor-length skirt.\n\nThe dress was eye-catching and intricate in design.\n\nFor the \"Highest 2 Lowest\" premiere, Johnson walked the red carpet in a strapless Gucci gown covered with pink fringe. The vibrant color choice was a departure from her usual neutral fashion.\n\nShe also wore massive Boucheron earrings crafted from diamonds, which sparkled in the light.\n\nShe looked stunning in a strapless maxi gown from Ferragamo, which retails for $1,850, and pumps from the same brand.\n\nThe star of the show, however, was her $1.2 million Roberto Coin necklace. The eye-catching piece was crafted from diamonds, sapphires, and white gold, and it matched her $25,000 blue ring.\n\nShe wore the pieces shortly after being named the Italian jewelry brand's latest ambassador.\n\nAlessandra Rich designed her cutout dress with a strapless, plunging V-shaped neckline. It also had two waist cutouts and a daring slit in the middle of its skirt.\n\nJust as bold as the dress was Johnson's selection of jewelry. She wore sparkling rings, earrings, and layered necklaces that covered part of her collarbones and chest.\n\nGucci custom-made her sleeveless gown, which was semi-sheer and lined with a strapless leotard.\n\nShe paired the dress with an updo hairstyle and $56,000 Boucheron hoop earrings.\n\nDesigned by Gucci, the black gown had one long sleeve, an asymmetrical neckline, and fabric hanging down the front and back of her body.\n\nOn the sides, though, it was only held together by the brand's signature horsebit hooks. The latter detail revealed her legs and hips as she walked.\n\nHer Ferragamo ensemble included a $1,490 asymmetrical miniskirt and a $2,900 blazer with a curved neckline that dipped beneath her chest.\n\nShe completed the look with sheer black tights and the brand's $980 pumps.\n\nAfter a rumored breakup between Johnson and Chris Martin, the actor was photographed wearing a $775 tulle-wrapped bodysuit and a matching $1,366 sheer skirt from Nensi Dojaka.\n\nThe outfit was dramatic, fashionable, and undoubtedly one of her most daring looks of the year.\n\nChloé designed her billowing gown, which had short tiered sleeves, a deep V-neckline, and a floor-length skirt. The latter and the bodice were both see-through.\n\nThe outfit was daring, as is Johnson's signature, but it was also feminine and timeless.\n\nThat outfit, of course, was her blue Gucci ball gown. It featured a lace bodice with long sleeves, a high neckline, and a full tulle skirt.\n\nThe dress was as vibrant as it was daring. Johnson wore nothing beneath its see-through top.\n\nShe arrived at Kering's Caring for Women dinner wearing a high-neck, long-sleeved dress crafted from sparkling floral lace. The form-fitting Gucci piece sat atop two pieces of black lingerie.\n\nTo complete the look, Johnson added emerald earrings that matched the color of her eyes.",

    "fullText": "LinkedIn cofounder Reid Hoffman said he wishes he'd known a little more before agreeing to spend a night on Jeffrey Epstein's island.\n\nOn the Dec. 1 episode of Eric Newcomer's podcast, Hoffman said that he visited the island as part of his fundraising work for the MIT Foundation and was told the visit would make Epstein more likely to donate to MIT.\n\n\"Note to self: Google before going,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. He said he stayed on the island for one night, and that there was a pool, a \"bunch of guest rooms,\" and a courtyard.\n\nHoffman has maintained that he only interacted with Epstein, whose 2019 death while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges was ruled a suicide, through his work fundraising for the MIT Media Lab. On the \"Newcomer\" podcast, he called Epstein a \"masterful networker,\" and recalled a 2015 dinner he hosted for an MIT researcher in Palo Alto, California.\n\nHoffman said that Joi Ito, former director of the MIT Media Lab, asked him if Epstein could attend the dinner, which was also attended by Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Similar to his visit to the island, Hoffman said he was later told that the financier had said he was more likely to donate if he attended the dinner.\n\n\"He's kind of going through the network, trying to meet people and so forth,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. Hoffman also reiterated previous apologies for his involvement with Epstein.\n\nIn 2019, a spokesperson for Zuckerberg confirmed the dinner to Business Insider and said it was the only time the Facebook cofounder met Epstein. A spokesperson for Musk also confirmed the Tesla CEO's attendance.\n\nIn a 2019 email to Axios, Hoffman acknowledged multiple interactions with Epstein, which he said were strictly for fundraising purposes, and said he had been told MIT had vetted and approved the convicted sex offender's participation. He said in the email he was \"deeply regretful\" of the involvement.\n\n\"I went and kind of made a, you know, very public apology because it was like, okay I realized this and I'd already at that point had ramped down connection with him, right, to like no meetings and all the rest of the stuff, under any context,\" Hoffman said on the podcast. \"And I think he still would drop me an email every so often and say, 'Hey, can we get on the phone?' I say, 'Oh, maybe sometime,' which is, you know, code for never, right?\"\n\nHoffman said that justice for the late pedophile's victims is important, and urged the government to release, unredacted, \"every single piece of intel that they have about Epstein.\"\n\nIn November, President Donald Trump signed a bill that will release the Department of Justice's files on Epstein after months of pressure from Congress, including some fellow Republicans. The department has until Saturday, December 19, to comply with the order.\n\nTrump has also ordered the DOJ to investigate Hoffman, along with other individuals he views as political enemies, including former President Bill Clinton and former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, over their ties to Epstein.\n\nHoffman, a billionaire and major Democratic donor, has previously said that he had to hire security after Musk fueled conspiracy theories about his relationship with Epstein.",

    "title": "Morgan Stanley cuts Tesla's stock rating from 'buy' for the first time in 2 years on valuation concerns",
    "description": "Tesla stock fell on Monday as Morgan Stanley downgraded its rating on the stock from \"buy\" to \"hold.\"",
    "fullText": "Tesla stock got a downgrade on Monday, sending it tumbling as much as 4% as Morgan Stanley lowered its recommendation for the first time since 2023.\n\nMorgan Stanley's Andrew Percoco downgraded Tesla from an \"Overweight/Buy\" to an \"Equal Weight/Hold\" rating. While he increased his price target to $425 per share, up from the previous $410, his new target still implies about 3% downside from levels late in the day on Monday.\n\nThe analyst noted that he believes Tesla will continue making progress on key initiatives, particularly its advancements in full self-driving and robotic technology. However, he thinks investors should wait for a better entry point, as share prices remain highly valued and the company could encounter further challenges amid lower demand for electric cars. Percoco said the bank had lowered its outlook specifically for Tesla's auto business.\n\n\"This is a reflection of lower volume expectations, with a 10.5% reduction in 2026 volumes and 18.5% reduction in cumulative deliveries through 2040 due to our more cautious view on the pace of EV adoption in the US coupled with growing competition in global markets.\"\n\nIt's been a volatile year for Tesla. After being down as much as 45%, it's up about 12% year-to-date, staging a big turnaround since CEO Elon Musk returned to the carmaker full time after spending several months leading the Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nPercoco said that investors should be ready for trading to be volatile in the coming 12 months.\n\n\"While it is well understood that Tesla is more than an auto manufacturer, we expect a choppy trading environment for the TSLA shares over the next 12 months, as we see downside to estimates, while the catalysts for its non-auto businesses appear priced at current levels, driving our EW rating,\" he said.\n\nPercoco's team recalibrated its sum-of-the-parts thesis that has informed the bank's Tesla valuation, accounting for Tesla's progress in developing humanoid robotics and robotaxi technology.\n\nIt cited both robotaxi public launches and FSD advancements as likely investment drivers, but also flagged execution risk around the rollout of its robotaxi, FSD, and humanoid robots.\n\nOne risk lies in Tesla's approach to FSD technology, an area that has sparked safety concerns from regulators and lawmakers. Most of its competitors rely on LiDAR technology to power their self-driving vehicles, a technology that Musk has criticized. Morgan Stanley analysts see this as a concern.\n\n\"TSLA has taken a unique camera-only approach with the rollout of its robotaxi service,\" the note said. \"While Tesla's camera-only approach drives a cost advantage (along with other factors discussed shortly) it will need to prove a very high level of safety in order to gain the trust of regulators, particularly in areas of the US with greater risk of inclement weather.\"\n\nAnd while enthusiasm for Tesla's Optimus robot is high, competition is rising, particularly from China. Percoco said China's government has prioritized developing the technology, posing a risk to a technology that Musk is staking much of Tesla's future growth prospects on.\n\nPercoco made it clear throughout the note that he's not bearish on Tesla stock, but he sees a strong possibility that the EV maker will struggle in the short term as it strives to position itself at the head of several emerging technologies.",

    "description": "PHNX 2025, led by Billy McFarland, hosted French Montana, excursions, viral food photos, and a modest turnout, avoiding Fyre Festival chaos.",
    "fullText": "Billy McFarland is trying to rise from the ashes of Fyre Festival.\n\nHis latest event is PHNX — pronounced \"Phoenix.\" It attracted dozens of attendees over the weekend. Like the original Fyre Festival, it was heavily documented by camera crews and social media users.\n\nSince being released from prison in 2022, after pleading guilty to wire fraud charges related to Fyre Festival, McFarland has been planning redemption from the disastrous 2017 festival that left hundreds of attendees stranded, hungry, and thirsty on a Bahamian island and became the subject of a hit Netflix documentary.\n\nOn Saturday and Sunday, McFarland ran it back with a smaller crowd, a mix of parties, excursions, and musical guests like French Montana as the headliner on Utila Bay, an island off the coast of Honduras.\n\nTo everyone who laughed at the bathroom barge. To everyone who said there wouldn’t be power. Who wants to be part of history? See you in 4 days.\n\nGeneral admission tickets to PHNX cost $599. VIP passes went for up to $140,000 and included round-trip flights from Miami. PHNX offered all attendees brunch, lunch, dinner, and a handful of excursions, including scuba diving and a cave hike, in their ticket packages.\n\nThe itinerary was a far cry from the events that unfolded in 2017. Where unsanitary or simply unavailable bathrooms became a hallmark of Fyre Festival's failures, McFarland showed off a \"bathroom barge\" of floating port-a-potties for PHNX. He also shared fresh fruit stands and food options, including lobster, steak, and fresh salads — a much different menu from the infamous cheese sandwiches served at the first Fyre Festival.\n\nFestival-goers, McFarland, and performers took their followers along for the ride at PHNX 2025. The event was also available via livestream for paying viewers.\n\nOne performer, a DJ who goes by 220 Kid, documented his time at the festival in several videos. His post about the vegetarian food option went particularly viral. The plate of rice and a single cob of corn drew scrutiny and a call back to the meager cheese sandwiches from 2017.\n\nRappers Slim Jxmmi and Bobby Shmurda showed up, and a clip from headliner French Montana's set showed a modest crowd dancing.\n\nConfirmed ! French showed up every artist did! Love this island so much ! #fyrefestival #PHNX\n\n\"We set out to bring 400 people and a dozen artists to a private island in the Utila Bay Islands, and the experience exceeded every expectation,\" McFarland said in a statement. \"PHNX 2025 was a milestone moment for us.\"\n\nVideos showed dozens of festival-goers on the dance floor at different times. It's unclear how many people attended.\n\nPHNX appeared to sidestep the big issues that defined Fyre, but it's too early to tell whether the event represents a meaningful reset for McFarland.\n\n\"This is only the beginning — a major announcement is coming soon,\" McFarland said.",

    "description": "Kenny Chesney's 2025 Sphere residency may have ended, but the singer is officially returning in the summer of 2026.",
    "fullText": "If you were worried you missed your chance to see Kenny Chesney live, worry not: during the final performance of his 2025 Las Vegas residency, the country legend announced his inevitable return to the Sphere for another residency in the summer of 2026. This information was shared again on Chesney's Instagram shortly after, confirming the news. I've broken down how to get Kenny Chesney tickets for his 2026 return below.\n\nThe official announcement and schedule were released on October 21, with five shows scheduled for June 2026. In addition to this, Kenny Chesney has an April appearance scheduled at the Tortuga Music Festival in Fort Lauderdale, which means there is no shortage of 2026 opportunities for the No Shoes Nation to catch the star performing live.\n\nKenny Chesney, who boasts 30 million albums sold worldwide and multiple awards, released his debut album, \"In My Wildest Dreams,\" in 1994. Since then, with countless albums and singles to his name, Chesney has enjoyed a long and prosperous career. In 2025, Kenny Chesney was also named a member-elect to the Country Music Hall of Fame.\n\nThe 2025 Las Vegas residency had been particularly exciting for fans, and, thanks to the venue's technological capabilities, they were not disappointed. Chesney himself said, \"These shows have been unbelievably fluid, capable of change-ups, and crazy requests. (…) When we said we were taking No Shoes Nation into another dimension, no one truly knew what that meant. Now that we do, we can't wait to come back and do it all over again.\"\n\nIf you're looking to learn more about getting tickets to see Kenny Chesney in the summer of 2026 for his second innovative Sphere Las Vegas residency, we've got you covered. Here's our breakdown of what we know so far about Kenny Chesney's residency schedule, purchasing details, and price comparisons between resale and original tickets. You can also browse purchasing details on StubHub and Vivid Seats at your own convenience.\n\nKenny Chesney will perform at the Tortuga Music Festival in Fort Lauderdale in April, followed by a continuation of his Las Vegas residency at the Las Vegas Sphere in June.\n\n* Indicates a music festival Kenny Chesney will be performing at, in addition to several other artists.\n\nOriginal tickets for Kenny Chesney’s 2026 residency are available for purchase on Ticketmaster. Ticketmaster also provides links to partner site FEVO for package reservations, including suites alongside Sphere tickets.\n\nAdditionally, tickets can be purchased from verified resale vendor sites, such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Depending on the demand for each individual date, you may find better-priced options on these sites over Ticketmaster.\n\nOriginal tickets for Kenny Chesney’s Sphere residency vary in price depending on the location, with reserved seats ranging from $120 (Original Standard) to over $1,000 (Original Platinum). Some more affordable seat options may have limited screen visibility, which will be indicated on Ticketmaster if this is the case. Standing floor tickets are also available for around $265, which offers the closest distance to the stage and may be more affordable if you’re looking to get up close to the action and don’t mind standing. In general, the Sphere is an extremely interactive venue with a high volume of screens to view the show from, so being in a seat further back does not mean you will have trouble seeing or enjoying the performance.\n\nResale prices are currently reasonable in comparison to standard tickets, as the shows still have original tickets available. StubHub prices range from $171 (as of June 26) to $250 (as of June 20) for the most affordable options, with prices on StubHub ranging from $150 to $199 for the same two shows. It may be a good idea to check resale vendors first before looking at original tickets, as it's possible to score a closer ticket for a lower price at this time. If you are interested in VIP packages, Ticketmaster is likely the best option.\n\nVIP packages for the 2026 shows start at about $890 and increase from there, depending on the selected package. VIP tickets included a choice of standing or premium reserved seats, priority entrance into Sphere Las Vegas, merch, and more. In addition to VIP concert tickets, some packages include hotel stays at The Venetian Resort Las Vegas (The Venetian or The Palazzo). Packages are priced starting at $926 for a general hotel and concert experience, or $1,358 for a VIP hotel and concert experience package. Details regarding the VIP package can be found on Ticketmaster’s partner site Vibee.\n\nFor Kenny Chesney’s Tortuga Music Festival appearance, prices are on the higher end (starting at $520 for StubHub and $506 for Vivid Seats) in comparison to his Sphere performances; however, this is due to the ticket including entry to a festival, which encompasses several artists and activities to participate in.\n\nFor Kenny Chesney’s 2025 Sphere residency, the opening act was DJ Brandi Cyrus. Chesney said that he felt a DJ, rather than a band, was the best choice to get the party started, as he wanted people to dance on the open floor.\n\nWhile we couldn’t find an official announcement at this time regarding a 2026 opener, it can be expected that he may do something similar to his previous Sphere performances next year as well.\n\nKenny Chesney had no performances scheduled outside Las Vegas during his 2026 residency and appearance at the Tortuga Music Festival in April.\n\nKenny Chesney is only scheduled to continue his Las Vegas residency in June. It is possible, however, that he may add performances or festival appearances outside those mentioned in the future. As of writing, nothing has been officially announced yet.",

    "fullText": "Before Netflix made its winning bid for Warner Bros., its co-CEO pitched President Donald Trump directly on the merits of the deal.\n\nThe pair found common ground, Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos said.\n\n\"The president's interests in this are the same as ours, which is to create and protect jobs,\" Sarandos said of Trump at the UBS media conference on Monday afternoon.\n\nSarandos said he'd talked to Trump \"many times since the election about the different challenges facing the entertainment industry.\"\n\n\"The president cares deeply about the entertainment industry, and he loves the entertainment industry,\" Sarandos continued.\n\nTrump praised Sarandos on Sunday, calling him a \"great person\" who he said had done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\" Still, Trump said Netflix's \"big market share\" in the streaming space \"could be a problem\" as it tries to buy Warner Bros. Discovery's streaming and studio assets.\n\nThe Netflix-Warner Bros. deal reached on Friday is worth $82.7 billion, including $72 billion in equity. WBD's TV networks like CNN or HGTV, aren't in the proposal.\n\nRival suitor Paramount Skydance responded on Monday with a hostile bid in the form of a $30-per-share, all-cash offer for all of WBD, including the declining TV networks. Netflix's offer is $27.75 per share, comprising mostly cash and some stock. There's debate among analysts about whether Netflix's or Paramount's renewed offer is more attractive, as it depends on the value of WBD's TV networks.\n\nParamount's move \"was entirely expected,\" Sarandos said.\n\nParamount CEO David Ellison, who Trump has publicly praised, went on CNBC on Monday morning to tout his company's offer as \"pro-consumer, pro-creative talent,\" and \"pro-competition.\" Ellison said his company's offer had \"faster regulatory certainty to close\" than Netflix's. Ellison's father, Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally and one of the richest people on the planet.\n\nHowever, Netflix also seems to be building rapport with Trump. That could help explain why Netflix's Sarandos and fellow co-CEO Greg Peters are optimistic about their deal.\n\n\"We are very confident that regulators should, and will, approve it,\" Peters said of the WBD deal.\n\nSarandos pitched the streaming giant's proposed acquisition as a net positive for the labor market, despite the concerns of many in Hollywood. He also said the company is \"deeply committed\" to releasing movies from Warner Bros. in theaters, \"exactly the way they've released those movies today.\"\n\nThat overture could help ease Trump's concerns. Sarandos pitched Netflix as a great job saver.\n\n\"What the president has been interested in, in this deal, has been: To what extent does it protect and create jobs in America?\" Sarandos said.\n\nSarandos warned that Ellison would implement lots of layoffs if his bid won and said the Paramount CEO promised about $6 billion in cost savings from a WBD deal. Those so-called \"synergies,\" in analyst jargon, translate to a smaller workforce, Sarandos said.\n\n\"Where do you think synergies come from? Cutting jobs,\" Sarandos said. \"We're not cutting jobs — we're making jobs.\"\n\nNetflix has promised investors $2 billion to $3 billion in its own cost savings from its Warner Bros. deal, however.",

Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison wrote in the memo to staffers, which was first obtained by Business Insider.\n\nThe Paramount CEO said he believes his all-cash, $30-per-share offer for all of WBD is superior to Netflix's $27.75 offer for WBD's streaming and studio assets, including the Warner Bros. film studio, HBO, and streamer HBO Max.\n\nParamount made a so-called hostile bid for WBD on Monday morning, hoping to get investors on its side.\n\nEllison is also trying to get his employees on board.

    "fullText": "The super soft Quince Mongolian Cashmere Crewneck Sweater feels more expensive than it is, and it's obvious why it's such a hit. It's main difference from Naadam's ($98) is that it's slightly thinner and not as smooth. I tested the newest Cashmere 2.0 version, which costs the same and felt slightly thicker than the original, but it's not as good as Naadam in terms of softness.\n\nI only wash my cashmere as needed in order to make it last. The Quince sweater feels thinner than Naadam's after washing, but I still don't find it any less wearable.\n\nOf course, the price tag on Quince's 100% Grade-A Mongolian cashmere is attractive when you see that it's practically identical to Naadam's. The patterns are the exact same (unless I'm really nitpicking — Quince's neckline is bound with a seam that looks slightly more unfinished and liable to fray). But the quality is acceptable and consistent with other Quince cashmere pieces I've tested. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\n\"The Quince puffer is insulated with 700+ fill power, so it'll keep you warm below freezing temperatures. The outer shell is wind-resistant and treated with a PFC-free DWR water-repellent finish to keep snow out. It also has a bungee hem when you need to better trap body heat.\n\nIt's nearly identical to (but $100 cheaper than) The Super Puff, with the same removable hood, thumbhole wrist cuffs, and extra pockets. The Aritzia coat was slightly warmer (though our executive editor, Sally Kaplan, didn't feel a big difference here during testing) and comes in a lot more color options, but if you don't need either of those features, the Quince Puffer saves you a hundred bucks.\n\nThe outer shell and lining are made with 100% recycled polyester, the down fill is responsibly sourced, and it's made by a brand that is committed to sustainability and fair manufacturing prices.\" — Rachael Schultz, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nSee \n\nQuince is one of our favorite sources for affordable cashmere, though the quality of its leather can be unpredictable. Of all the Quince leather pieces I've tested, the brown can look sort of flat in person — which is why I recommend going for the black Quince Leather Gloves.\n\nThis pair has a timeless design, and the naturally insulating, moisture-wicking cashmere lining will keep your hands toasty warm and dry. Skip these if you're sensitive to lanolin though, as the fibers could irritate your skin. See our guide to the best shoe polishes for a leather conditioner you can use to prevent them from becoming dry and cracked.\" — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nStyle editor Samantha Crozier tested dozens of the best work bags for women to find durable totes to take to the office. Her favorite affordable pick is this simple carryall, which has tiny metal feet to keep its base off the floor, as well as a sleek leather exterior that looks more expensive than it is.\n\n\"If there's one criticism I have of this bag, it's the lack of pockets with zippers,\" she writes. \"The only zippered compartment is the center pocket that's meant for a laptop. Other than that, there are three open pockets in the interior that are big enough for a cell phone.\n\nThe tote is also not lined, which doesn't make too much of a difference when you're using it, but the interior is not as luxurious as most of the bags on this list. However, it does mean that the interior is wipe-clean, which is blessedly low maintenance.\"\n\nPerfect for holiday parties, this washable silk skirt comes in standard and extended sizes and is woven in shades of rich burgundy, chocolate, and more.\n\n\"This is a piece I know I'll keep wearing all season long. It can be styled so many ways, whether with an oversized sweater or a little tee,\" writes our senior home editor Jaclyn Turner in our Quince plus-size review. \"I'm between an XL and a 1X, and I appreciate the roominess of the 1X. I recommend sizing up if you want a smoother fit since the silk is quite clingy.\"\n\n\"The thick silk feels premium and cascades beautifully,\" says associate editor Kinsley Searles, who also tried this silk skirt. \"There's no zipper — instead it pulls on and the elastic band sits firmly in place. But while the elastic waistband is flexible, it's important to note that the silk itself is not stretchy.\"\n\nRead \n\nQuince undercuts many brands featured in our guide to the best loafers for women. This pair has many of the same features as the Glove Flats, like genuine Italian leather and Ortholite insoles.\n\nI tested these against Margaux's Andie leather loafers ($345), and the Quince loafers proved to a better bang for your buck. The main drawback is that the black suede around the toes got a little faded the more I wore them, so I recommend choosing the Almond colorway to keep them looking newer for longer. \n\nThat being said, I'm still impressed at how much they look and perform like Margaux loafers. The stacked leather heel is actually sturdy, and inside the leather is soft and molded to my feet.  I don't suggest these for wide feet or sensitive high arches, but they fit me (size US 8) comfortably and true to size. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nBesides the perfectly oversized fit, the thing I love most about this dress coat is that it's lined on the inside for added warmth. Many slouch coats are made without a lining because the lack of added structure allows the wool to drape more loosely. While that may give you a slightly more cozy silhouette, it means you miss out on any real insulation. The lining here gives the coat just enough structure to feel sophisticated and clean, but clever details like a shoulder seam that continues down the arm still gives it an almost cape-like, drop-shoulder fit.\n\nI would personally recommend opting for the black color over the tan. While the tan might look nice in online photos, I can tell that the color is pretty flat, which means it won't look quite as elegant in person. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis carry-on bag was really easy to wheel around, and I was grateful for its smoothness when navigating the subway. I tested both this version and the Front Pocket version, but the pocket was pretty useless and only made it bulkier, so I recommend saving the extra $30 and going with the pocketless version. \n\nThis hardshell style is lightweight, but not flimsy. I like that the inside has a removable mesh pocket and a zipped pouch that unfurls and can be easily tucked away when not in use. I use it whenever I need to pack about four days worth of outfits and toiletries.\n\nIt comes with its own magic eraser to wipe off scuff marks, but I honestly don't think it's worth the extra effort just for it to become scuffed the next time I use it. If you're concerned about scratches, you'd better get a protective sleeve or choose a soft-shell suitcase instead. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\nThis wool scarf coat sold out last season before I could try it, but I've been keen to test out this designer dupe. It's Quince's version of the Toteme Embroidered Scarf Jacket ($1130), which is a street-style favorite among fashion editors. Toteme's is made of a wool-poly blend, while the Quince coat is 100% Merino wool. \n\nThis coat may look warm and cozy because of its oversized fit, but the felt-like material is actually quite thin. It works better as a stylish top layer than an actual coat. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThe midi-length counterpart to the Mongolian Cashmere Turtleneck dress is a solid option if you want a dress with more coverage. It's pretty roomy around the middle, so it's best to size down if you want a more fitted look. Otherwise, if you have a statement belt you've been wanting to break out, you can wear it to draw in the waist on this dress.\n\nThe turtleneck is high enough to reach my chin so it's a great option for keeping warm while still looking polished. It has side slits to allow my legs to move easily, and the skirt length hits me a bit past my knees. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nEverlane's Day Glove Flats currently hold the top spot in our guide to the best flats, and are a long-standing favorite of executive editor Sally Kaplan. In our Everlane Day Glove flats review, she says, \"there exists on this earth no better flat.\" However, the Quince Italian Leather Glove Ballet Flats may be a substitute.\n\nAlong with several other of Quince's dupes, these Day Glove-lookalikes sold out almost as soon as they became available. Upon first inspection, they are practically indistinguishable from Everlane's. They even have the same pull-tabs and perforations around the inner arches to help ventilate the shoe — which is good, because the leather can and will get sweaty inside. The leather has some give, but if you have extra wide feet, I'd skip these. It's also worth noting that Quince doesn't offer them in narrow or half sizes, but Everlane does. I wear a size 8 and these have a nearly true-to-size fit that lean a tad tight, especially around the top seam.\n\nI found Quince's Glove flats to likewise have zero break-in time — as soon as I slipped them on, they felt like wearing soft leather slippers. I like how much traction their rubber soles have compared to other flats I've tried, and their Ortholite insoles provide cushioning below the arches. \n\nThe material is 100% Italian cow Nappa leather and made in Shenzhen, China, while Everlane claims their Day Glove is made in Santa Maria a Monte, Italy. The key distinction Quince makes on their site is that their version is less than half the price of Everlane's, so if you're looking for an affordable alternative to a cult favorite, this is the right pair. I'll be curious to see if they hold up for as long as two years, as the Day Gloves did for Sally. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nMy favorite part of this midi dress is how stretchy the fabric feels, and I appreciate that it's thin without being flimsy. On the inside is a light lining that's slightly compressive, but the split hem in the rear makes it so that you can still take long strides comfortably. It's an ideal travel dress because it rolls up into a tidy bundle and tucks neatly into my carry-on. \n\nIt's a great value on a casual lounge dress compared to similar styles from Athleta or Lululemon. It also comes in a long-sleeve version you can wear during the colder months. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThe Quince silk slip dress revealed to us the true nature of the brand's clothing. It's a flattering, classic style that style editor Samantha Crozier was able to wash and wear for about nine months until it finally tore. That being said, it's an easy dress to throw on, with a beautiful sheen that makes you feel polished in no matter where you wear it — and it's highly affordable for genuine silk.\n\n\"The dress is only $89.90. When I was on the hunt for a silk dress, I mulled over dresses as high as $250 for days, wondering if I could justify the price. For me, this dress is the perfect combination of price, style, and fit,\" says Crozier. \n\nYou're likely to get a lot of use from this dress before you experience the same disappointment. It also recently became available in extended sizes. However, its shelf life does put it in the category of fast fashion, so we can't call it a sustainable option.\n\nRead \n\nI've tested a lot of washable silk from brands like Quince and Everlane, and I've gotta say, it's never really that great (stay with me though, because I like this dress!). The silk almost always ends up dulling over time and the material is really too thin to stand up to a washing machine. It's not so much the stitching as it is the Denier of the silk itself — it just doesn't have the strength to withstand the pulling motions of a machine. That's why I only opt for washable silk pieces that aren't meant to be worn all the time, like this dress.\n\nEven though I'll be dry cleaning it instead of machine washing, I think it's worth taking good care of clothes you really like, and I really like this one. It's easy to style with or without a belt, though if you're super short like me (I'm 5-foot-2), you might be better off using a belt to shorten the dress a little. I love the slight balloon sleeve detail, too, which gives this dress a bit of extra volume. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis linen dress from Quince is a great staple piece that I know I'll be wearing a lot this summer. I love the fact that it has pockets, which is a huge win for functionality. The shirred back is also a flattering touch, since it emphasizes your waist. Most linen dresses are pretty sheath-like, so I like that this one has some structure to it.\n\nBut I'm not a fan of how this dress is lined. Instead of a full-length lining, it stops right at the knees. You can't see this unless you're hanging out in the sun, but that's exactly what this dress was made for. This makes it look like the dress cuts you in an awkward way and is another example of how Quince gets it almost right, but how cost-saving measures get in the way of producing a truly great piece.\n\nThis dress does come in eight colorways, including pinstripes, gingham, and more — and I'm sure the awkward lining length would be much less visible in a non-white color. — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Business Insider Reviews.\n\nI wanted to test this comfy dress straight out of the bag in came in, and it proved its versatility immediately. The fabric is made from a supremely soft, stretchy blend of Tencel and Spandex, which clings at its top and flows around its midi-length skirt. I was building up a bit of a sweat while vacuuming in it, yet it felt so light and breathable that I kept on wearing it after I'd cooled down.\n\nI'm 5-foot-9 and have a short torso, so the size S fit has more of a drop-waist that flares around the hips. Importantly, though, this dress has two hip pockets — so besides being extremely comfortable, it's also convenient. If you want a version you can really sweat in, Quince offers the same design in its moisture-wicking Flowknit fabric. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nNot every Quince silk dress was up to our standards — the slip dress, for example, tore after over a year of wear — but for the amount of times you're bound to wear and wash this special-occasion dress, it feels worth the price point.\n\n\"While elegant enough to dress up with some heels and a clutch for dinner, I mostly pair [this maxi dress] with sneakers for an elevated and comfortable daytime look. The sneaker look works for me because, at 5-foot-7, the dress hits me right above the ankles, but if you're shorter, it may fall closer to the floor.\n\nOn particularly hot days, I did sweat in this dress (usually I pick sleeveless items when I think I may sweat), and the sweat was fairly visible through the silk fabric. That's the only downside I found to this dress. I washed it cold on the delicates cycle and hung it to dry. I steamed it to remove wrinkles (ironing silk is not recommended). Each time I wore the dress after washing, I found it as soft and shiny as before.\" — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\nAs long as you have the right pieces to zhuzh it up, we found this 100% cotton button-down to be a great affordable work dress. \n\n\"A denim dress might not be your first thought for workplace attire, but hear me out. They can totally work on casual Fridays, in more laid-back office environments, or dressed up in the right way,\" writes freelance style reporter Rebecca Strong.\n\n\"It's a reasonable length, falling to right above my knee, and the denim material feels soft — not stiff, like some. While the dress comes in a variety of washes, I think the darker blue or black are your best bets for a professional setting.\"\n\nWe had two editors, size 1X and 3X, test pieces from the brand's new extended size collection for our Quince plus size review. There were both hits and misses, but the Tencel Rib Knit material proved to be a unanimous favorite.\n\n\"This piece was the one that was most outside of my comfort zone, so I was surprised that I ended up really liking this style. Silhouette-wise, it's a dead ringer for the viral Skims Long Slip Dress, but priced about $20 cheaper. It's super soft and stretchy, made from a mix of ribbed Tencel and Spandex, and it felt very breathable. This piece has great day-to-night potential — I could see wearing it out to a summer dinner on its own, but I really liked how it looked when paired with a blazer for work. I'm 5'11\", and this dress hit me right around the ankles with shoes on. The adjustable straps help adjust the length a bit, but I'd say if you're shorter than 5'7\", you may need to wear heels with this dress or consider getting it hemmed.\" —Lauren Savoie, deputy editor, Insider Reviews\n\nIf you're looking for a cozy throw-on outfit, I highly recommend this jumpsuit. Though the legs were a bit long on my 5'1\" frame, the jumpsuit fit like a dream — just roomy enough to layer a turtleneck underneath on chillier spring days, but not so oversized that I couldn't just wear it on its own without my bra showing. The linen isn't particularly hefty, but in the black color, it remains totally opaque.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis is my one sweater dress to rule them all: it has just 3% cashmere, so it's soft without being itchy if you're sensitive to lanolin. I like that the fabric is heavyweight and stretchy, and how comfortable and clingy the fit feels. \n\nI also love that there's a tie in the rear so I can pull it tighter around my waist, preventing it from becoming another lumpy, misshapen sweater dress. It's proven worth the $70, since I've worn it at least once a week in the span of a month. With a quick switch of accessories, this sweater dress can be transformed from a cozy loungewear look to a semi-formal outfit.\n\nRead more about its versatility in my full Quince sweater dress review. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nA winter dress as comfy as it is warm, Quince's cashmere turtleneck frock (available in five cozy hues) is a great dressier staple for colder months. My body is pear-shaped, and even though I sized up to a large, the dress was still very fitted around my bottom half, so I probably wouldn't choose this one first for professional settings. Still, it's a great piece to throw on with a pair of calf-height heel boots for an evening out. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nI love the simplicity of this tank dress, but the high slit gives it a flirty feel that elevates it a bit. I found the material to be ever-so-slightly sheer when I bent over, so I recommend sizing up for a little extra give when you bend or move around. I opted for a large, which is my usual size, but I could have gone up to the XL for a bit more room. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis organic cotton poplin dress is a great dupe for the popular Somerset dress from Anthropologie at less than half the price. It comes in eleven color options, including this bright reddish-orange color, and while the cotton material has no stretch, the dress has elastic at the waist for flexibility with the sizing. On the model, it hits mid-calf, but on my 5'1\" frame, it was a full-length maxi dress. I'll definitely be wearing this on date nights and warm weather outings! — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI've found that linen clothing isn't Quince's strong suit, and while this dress is lightweight, it doesn't feel durable. My other wish for its design would be to add some silicone grips where the sleeves sit on the shoulders, because the elastic feels scratchy on bare skin. \n\nI got the size small, which has a pretty short hemline for a 5'9\" frame — to put it in terms of your average middle school dress code, this length would just barely be passing. But the stretchy bodice and billowy sleeves fit just right, and the skirt has a nice swing to it, so I'm still bound to get a decent amount of use from it. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nSome might consider sweatsuits to be activewear, but for me, it's just something easy and comfortable to throw on when I don't need to be dressed for a particular occasion. Over the years, I've tested well over a dozen sweatsuits from different brands and Quince is one of the best — the price makes it even better. If I had to guess the MSRP on the crewneck sweatshirt and fleece jogger before knowing how affordable the brand is, I would've said $80 each.\n\nBoth the top and bottom are made of 375g heavyweight organic cotton fleece, which makes them warmer and softer than most other options at this price. Smaller details like metal tips on the drawstrings and a hidden zippered smartphone pocket also make the set feel very premium.\n\nI could have gone with a size small for a better fit, but I prefer the extra space of the size medium. And don't worry about the wrinkles; I've been wearing this set strictly for comfort.   — Amir Ismael, senior reporter, Insider Reviews\n\nDuring the pandemic, we wrote a lot about the best loungewear you can buy, so I tested probably 10-15 lounge sets while working from home. I wish I had known about this set sooner, because it's definitely my new favorite!\n\nThe material is relatively thin and lined with a super soft fleece that feels like you're wearing a cloud. The wide-leg pants fell in just the right place on my calf, and I love that they're versatile enough to pair with other tops besides the matching sweatshirts. The crew fit really well, and though it wasn't cropped by design, it tucked into the high-waisted pants without billowing out too much.  It took two or three washes to stop seeing little bits of fuzz lingering behind on the inside, so I recommend putting it through the laundry before your first wear.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI've long searched for the perfect white button-up, but of the ones I've tried, many were just too see-through. For that reason, I was skeptical about trying this blouse in white, but I was impressed at how opaque it was, only showing the faintest outline of my tan bra in certain spots. Still, it felt polished enough to wear in a business setting if you're intent on finding where to shop for women's workwear clothes.\n\nI sized up to a medium (I'm usually in between small and medium in tops), which was a good choice. The fit is roomy and relaxed but not oversized. It looks great tucked into a pair of high-waisted jeans or layers nicely under Quince's Baby Alpaca Wool Cropped Sweater. Like the skirt, the washable silk blouse comes in fifteen colors. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nQuince's fisherman knit is one of my favorite patterns I've tried from its cashmere collection — it's chunky, structured, but still very soft. This vest is made from a 7 gauge cashmere, meaning it's lightweight and ideal for layering. It has a long, boxy, slightly oversized fit, so size down if you prefer your waistline to be visible. I'm wearing this on it's own for a casual look, but it looks very smart worn atop a white button-down. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis Merino wool half-zip has a chunky knit like a fisherman sweater, and it's really easy to layer with because of the loose, oversized fit. Wearing this has made me realize I actually love a half-zip closure because I can loosen it when I pull it over my head and it won't mess up my hair or smudge my makeup. Then once it's on, I zip it back up and it keeps my neck warm. \n\nI like the chunky lower gauge knit for this kind of sweater because it feels heavyweight and insulating without suffocating me around the neckline. And for the price, you really can't do much better on a Merino wool sweater of this quality. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nOf all the best cashmere sweaters we've tested, Quince has my favorite affordable options. This style is better suited for colder temperatures than the original Cashmere Crewneck. It isn't necessarily as chunky as you'd expect from a classic fisherman's sweater, but the density is still plenty enough to stay warm with. Here I'm wearing it with one of favorite scarves, the matching Mongolian Cashmere Scarf. I wear this sweater all winter long (even to bed) because it's so soft and comfortable. It fit me true to size, though next time I'd size up so the sleeves can fall further past my wrists. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis one might be my absolute favorite sweater that I own. Originally, I was drawn to the ivory version, but then I read reviews of the white colorway being a bit see-through, so I chose the similar light gray version instead. I love that I can wear this cardigan totally on its own, or layer it over a collared blouse or basic tee. Its oversized buttons give it a nice vintage feel, as if it came straight from grandpa's closet, but its blouson sleeves modernize and elevate the look.\n\nAlthough the cardigan is described as cropped on the website, for me, it hit right at the top of my hips (and I have a longer torso), so semi-cropped might be a more accurate descriptor. The best part: it's snuggly warm and not even remotely itchy. I have never been able to wear a wool sweater without a tank underneath due to the itching, but this one made it possible. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nSlightly cropped and perfectly midweight, this cotton sweater is a real winner through the seasons. I love to half-tuck it into jeans or drape it around my shoulders. The design is simple but executed well for the price point, and you'll get the cost-per-wear down in no time because it's so versatile. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI love a cropped cardigan and this one in the color Cement Marl (one of seven) features heavily in my wardrobe. I find myself reaching for it week after week, though it has admittedly stretched out a little over time and the button placard has gotten a bit misshapen with regular wear and washing. I could have done more to prevent this by only laying it flat to dry, but I'm lazy so I put it through the dryer all the time. If you take care of this as you should, it'll last you a lot longer before it starts to stretch out.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI'm allergic to wool, so every time I find an oversized cotton sweater or cardigan, I get extra excited. After testing this one from Quince, I consider the brand a top selection for the best sweaters for women and am definitely planning to buy it in more colors! I love the swingy, oversized fit, and the weight of it is substantial enough that I don't worry about it stretching or shrinking.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI'm all about having a unique selection of different knit sweaters for the winter, but if there's one basic style I have to have in my closet, it's a black turtleneck. I can dress it up or down and it makes for a great base layer. With matching black jeans, a black turtleneck goes well with almost any combination of jacket, shoes, and hat. This past winter season, Quince's Mongolian Cashmere Turtleneck Sweater was my go-to.\n\nWhen it comes to cashmere, I'm less concerned about the brand name and more about the quality of the materials. After all, you'll never see the branding, but the material is what's next to your skin. Made from 100% Grade A Mongolian Cashmere, I didn't have any issues wearing Quince's Cashmere sweater directly on my skin for hours at a time.\n\nI've come across quite a few sweaters in the same price range — some for even less — but they're notoriously itchy. At that point, they're not worth the savings.  — Amir Ismael, men's style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\nThis slouchy, casual-but-polished sweater has become my go-to for Zoom calls. The fit is perfectly oversized — I'm usually between a small and a medium in tops and the S/M fits me well with room to spare — which makes it great for layering on top of a long-sleeve shirt or tank. Thanks to the longer tunic-style length, it looks great with a pair of leggings or jeans but can also be worn over a midi skirt for a more elevated look. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nI was hoping Quince's Flowknit fabric would feel similar to some of my other favorites from Vuori or Outdoor Voices — and indeed, it did. Quince's version is still buttery soft and super stretchy, but it's much more affordable than its competitors. This heathered hoodie is perfect for both workouts and running errands.\n\nI love the thumb loops and the sleeves are extra-long, which is great for me since I'm 5'7\", but I imagine they might be a bit too long for more petite people. My only wish is that Quince offered it in more colors to match more of their Ultra-Soft Performance Leggings, because the two make such a cute set. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nQuince's Ponte collection includes this billowy wide-leg pair that have now become a staple in my workwear wardrobe. These stretchy work pants feel like sweatpants, but have the polished appearance of slacks. They pull on effortlessly with a concealed zipper and clasp at the hip, and the extra high-rise waistband is comfortable enough to sit in all day.\n\nI'm five-foot-nine, so I was pleased to learn these come in a 32-inch inseam that falls past my ankles. The material is thin, so in the winter I wear leggings underneath to stay warm. They're not entirely wrinkle-resistant, but I'd still recommend them to anyone who's looking for a solid pair of black work pants they can lounge in. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis white poplin skirt isn't just my new favorite style from Quince, it's maybe one of my favorite pieces of clothing ever. It's not see-through at all thanks to a thin cotton lining under the poplin, but it still remains super breezy and light. I love the length on my very short frame, but even if you're taller, you can wear it at different spots on your waist to get a shorter or longer fit. I'm a sucker for an elastic waist band (comfy clothes only!) and anything with pockets (yes, it has pockets!!!), so basically this is my dream skirt and I'll be wearing it as often as my laundry schedule allows. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI tested these high-rise straight jeans from Quince's first denim collection, and during my first try-on, they seem to look and feel just like a pair of Mother Denim jeans I thrifted years ago (which probably originally cost over $200). Quince jeans cost only $50, so this comparison proves to me that Quince denim is worth trying if you're on a budget. They're certainly not luxury quality — Quince's are too thin and stretchy — but for the price, they're just okay.\n\nPeople with an hourglass figure who struggle to fit their hip-to-waist ratio will appreciate this stretchy high-rise waistband. When I held them up to myself in the mirror, I assumed they'd be too tight around the hips, but the elastic factor is impressive. They hug my curves and give me a subtle lift in the seat area. I even found that they lightly compress around my waist, so there's no gap around my middle. \n\nQuince advises that these run big — for reference, I'm 5'9\" and ordered a size 27. I'm about 38 inches around the hip, and found that the stretchiness allowed for the perfect amount of wiggle room. \n\nI tend to wear my jeans many times between washes, so I've yet to see how this pair fades over time. But in the meantime, I'm wearing these stretchy jeans with my favorite flats and looking forward to more size-inclusive options in the next Quince denim release. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\nWhen Quince named its \"Ultra-Soft Bike Short,\" they weren't being hyperbolic. I'd go as far as to say \"ultra\" is an understatement.\n\nTrust me, I've tested a lot of activewear in my career; this is the softest material I've ever put on my body. The style is constructed from 84% recycled polyester (sourced from about 4 to 5 recycled PET bottles) and 16% Spandex. It boasts a 4-way stretch, adding to its comfortability, and while it keeps everything secure and smooth, it's not restrictive. I've worn them for low-impact yoga flows and mat pilates, paired them with a sweatshirt for all-day wear, and I would probably feel comfortable sleeping in them, too. — Julia Guerra, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nA silk skirt is such a versatile wardrobe staple. It pairs well with sneakers and a t-shirt or slouchy sweater for a casual ensemble or can be worn with heels and a matching silky camisole for a dressy evening look. I was super excited to try Quince's version, which comes in an impressive range of nine colors.\n\nThis skirt, which hits just below the knees, did not disappoint. I'm currently between a medium and a large in bottoms, and sizing up to a large ended up being the right call. The elastic waistband falls loosely at my hips and the skirt is plenty flowy, so it doesn't show any panty lines.  — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nThese moisture-wicking leggings are made from approximately seven recycled water bottles each, which you wouldn't expect based on how soft and stretchy they feel. The pants, available in 11 colors, have a 25-inch inseam and a super high waist. I wore them cycling and they stayed put throughout my entire workout. They're the perfect partner for the Pullover Hoodie above. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nThese pants were the biggest miss of the bunch for me, and I think it had more to do with the color than the execution. The pants themselves are super lightweight and great to throw on over a swimsuit for a pool day, but the white color (which looked more beige on the site) is stark and sheer. The elastic waist at least gives you some flexibility in terms of sizing, plus it makes the pants extra comfy.  — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis lightweight, packable windbreaker is derivative of lululemon's Always Effortless jacket. I wore it on a day that New York City experienced its largest 1-hour temperature drop ever. I was in the park basking in the sunlight, it was a balmy 79 degrees, and I was convinced spring had sprung. But by the time I'd walked home, it was cloudy and 53 degrees. \n\nI was so glad I had packed this jacket in my tote bag — it takes up almost no space, and it has stowable hood in case of rain. This hood packs into the tall stand collar, and it's wide enough to actually fit over my hair. I usually wear a size S, but I sized up to an M and it was the right call, since this jacket's a bit cropped. One detail I loved is that its zippers match the fabric perfectly, so it has a true monochromatic look.\n\nYou can wear this jacket to exercise, since it's lined with a soft mesh and has a vent in the rear to circulate air. Or, use it as a stylish, sporty top layer on those days with hard-to-predict forecasts. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\n\"The leather looks slightly aged for a vintage look, the shearling is both stylish and warm when popped up and worn around the neck, and the hardware feels solid and sturdy. I've seen similarly priced jackets made using faux leather and shearling that completely miss the mark for me.\n\nQuince's version is the ideal solution for anyone who doesn't want to spend close to $1,000 (or more, depending on the brand) on a flight jacket. Yes, you'll sacrifice some quality — especially when it comes to seam construction and tailoring — but it's worth it to me for the cost savings.\" — Amir Ismael, men's style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\nLeather shirt jackets are a wardrobe staple that can carry you through every season, and this one from Quince is a really affordable option — though there are some clear reasons why. While it's made from real leather, most of the paneling inside of the shirt is unlined. That means the underside of the leather is exposed, so I can tell just how thin it is. However, it doesn't affect the look of the shirt, so I still think it's a good value for anyone who isn't into synthetic leather but also doesn't want to pay $300+ for a piece like this.\n\nIn terms of sizing, the sleeves run a little long, but the body of the jacket is true to size. It comes in this mushroom beige as well as black, and it looks super effortless when paired with a T-shirt and some jeans or wide-leg pants. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI wear this shirt jacket more than maybe any other sweater in the fall and winter. The material is substantial and feels like it costs way more than it does. It can be worn buttoned, unbuttoned, or my favorite, belted with a slip skirt and knee-high boots or flowy pants. Definitely size down — it's very much oversized so even if you opt for a size smaller than you usually buy, you'll still have some room. — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI've always liked the look of suede bombers, but as someone who owns so many other jackets, it's been hard to justify spending a significant amount of money on a style I didn't necessarily need and would only wear once in a blue moon.\n\nEven if your reasoning isn't the same as mine, the fact of the matter is that a quality suede jacket can easily run you $700, if not more. I received the Suede Bomber for the purpose of this Quince review, but I definitely would pay the $150 price tag for it — and I still might grab another in a different colorway (such as their black or brown). It's made from 100% top-grain goat suede leather and it feels like it could be sold for at least three or four times the asking price. After trying it out, it promptly earned a spot in our guide to the best bomber jackets for men.\n\nThe jacket runs true to size, but don't be afraid to size up for a roomier fit. The models on the site are listed as being 6'0\" and 6' 1\" wearing a medium; I'm 5 '5 \", and the medium also fits me nicely. — Amir Ismael, men's style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI am a big fan of Quince's MicroModal underwear. I helped to test undies for our guide to the best underwear for women and genuinely thought Tommy John was the only place I'd buy underwear for the rest of my life — until I tried Quince's undies. The quality isn't as long-lasting, but for the price point, I'm personally okay with that.\n\nAt first, I loved the airy Second Skin material most because it's super lightweight and extremely stretchy, similar to Tommy John's Air Mesh underwear. I've tried the thongs and briefs, as well as the Scoop-Neck Bralette and the Crossover Bralette all in the Second Skin material, but after testing for several months and seeing how they've worn through multiple washes (lots of threads coming loose along the waistband), I'd recommend sticking with the MicroModal underwear instead.\n\nThe MicroModal underwear is incredibly comfortable and slightly thicker, kind of like super stretchy cotton, so I prefer wearing those pairs with jeans. They are breathable with a comfortable elastic waistband that doesn't dig in whatsoever.   — Sally Kaplan, executive editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI tested a slew of bikinis to find the best swim tops for small busts, and Quince's string-tie halter top was my favorite of the bunch. I've worn it for two seasons in a row and it still looks like brand new.\n\nIt's one of the few that didn't give me awkward gaps, and the moveable triangles let you customize their spacing. The fabric is a soft, stretchy material that is of comparable quality to the swimsuits I've tried from Andie and Left On Friday.\n\nI also liked that removable pads weren't bulky or misshapen, and its gold accents are a pretty detail (but be warned: you can't wear them in the sauna, or the metal will burn you). The bottoms are like wearing dental floss, so if you're not into showing lots of cheek, I would skip these.\n\nIf you want a Quince bikini with more coverage that'll better withstand high-impact activity, I suggest the V-Neck Bikini Top and High Rise Bikini Bottom instead. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThese two backpacks are nearly identical, but the Dagne Dover version has a few more bells-and-whistles that make it one of our all-time favorite work backpacks. Still, it costs $210, which is pretty steep considering it's not waterproof or made of suede. For a lot cheaper, you can get the luxe neoprene look and most of the same features you want in a college backpack.\n\n\"Both bags feature the same padded laptop sleeve, front exterior pocket with a key ring, two external and one internal water bottle pocket, rear luggage sleeve, and zip-up pouch. In addition to all of this, the Dakota has two extra zip-up pockets inside its front flap, a shoe bag, plus exterior zip-up pockets on either side. The Quince backpack instead has just one,\" writes deals fellow Jennifer Gonnick.\n\nRead \n\nThis 100% top-grain Italian leather makeup bag set is stunning. There are four colors to choose from (I picked olive), and each is outfitted with gold-tone zippers. At $70 for the set, it makes a timeless gift that can be used for years to come.\n\nIt's pretty basic in the way of organizational features (the larger bag has one flush slip pocket), but being able to divide items between two cases is advantageous. If you're trying to maximize packing space, this is a solid bet.\n\nI used the 6.5 x 11 x 3.5-inch bag to stow larger full-size makeup items, and I was able to fit two foundations, a tinted moisturizer, two blushes, five blush/contour/highlight sticks, three lipsticks, a makeup setting spray, and an eyeshadow palette — with room to spare.\n\nIn the 5 x 9 x 3-inch clamshell, I carried full-size makeup brushes and a concealer. On shorter trips, you could also use the larger bag for travel-size toiletries (the water-resistant microfiber interior can be wiped clean) and the smaller pouch for makeup. I love that the smaller bag can be nested inside the larger one to save space when it's not in use. — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nI like this mini shoulder bag's sculptural shape and its material quality is more than fine, but as we've seen from testing other Quince leather goods in the shade \"Cognac,\" black is really the way to go. This brown color is more muted in person, and the pebbled leather doesn't translate well. It's pretty small, but works well to hold the bare essentials. I consider this as more as an accent piece than a way to carry all my belongings. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nQuince's affordable belt bag is made from 100% water-resistant recycled nylon that's durable and lightweight. I consider it Quince's dupe for the Lululemon Everywhere Belt Bag, with a spacious main compartment and smaller mesh interior sleeves, as well as a key leash. It's a bit too bulky to jog with, but it's the perfect size for travel and concerts. If you're shopping for gifts, you can put lip balms, a unique keychain, and other mini accessories in this fanny pack as its own little gift basket. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThe quilted leather camera crossbody bag is such a good everyday staple that's easy to dress up or down. At 6 x 8.5 x 3 inches, it's more spacious than it looks, and I can easily fit my large wallet, sunglasses, phone, keys, and even a purse-shaped water bottle inside. In terms of appearance, it's comparable to the ultra-popular Saint Laurent Lou quilted camera bag, but of course, it comes at a very small fraction of the price. For 100% top-grain Italian leather, the price tag is unbeatable.  — Talia Ergas, freelance writer, Insider Reviews\n\nI've seen dupes of those suede cork clogs (you know the ones) at Target, but Quince's are a better upgrade because they're made with genuine suede. These mules have a cork midsole like the real deal, but the insole is much more forgiving because it has cushioned arch support.\n\nThey've become my go-to house shoes because they're sturdy, flexible, and have a nice laid-back, West Coast look when I wear them with jeans. I wear mine almost exclusively indoors because the suede isn't super structured, but the comfortable footbed makes them worth it. I'm a size US 8 and found they run a bit small, so I recommend sizing up if you're even slightly between sizes. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThese knit mules are featured in our most comfortable heels guide. According to style editor Samantha Crozier, they take almost no break-in time and the elastic upper is suitable for those with bunions or irregularly shaped feet. However, we don't recommend them for narrow feet because they'll probably slip off.\n\n\"The silhouette of Quince's Eco Knit Heeled Mule is strikingly similar to Everlane's Day Glove Mule in ReKnit , but Quince's is a quarter of an inch higher and about half as expensive (when the Everlane shoe is not on sale)\n\nI was a little worried that these would make a clomp-clomp sound (like a few people have reported with the Everlane Day Glove Mules), but I was pleasantly surprised that the knit had enough tension in it that the shoe stayed tight to my foot.\n\nThese are super walkable and slightly more casual than a toe strap sandal or a slingback. They're a great option for everyday workwear —elevating jeans while still looking sharp enough to pair with a blazer.\" — Samantha Crozier, style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nI wanted to like these Gucci lookalikes, but I was immediately unimpressed with their construction. The leather felt too thin and loosely structured, and the positioning of the footbeds felt so off that I checked to see I hadn't put them on the opposite feet by accident. \n\nI've gathered from this example that even though Quince's Italian leather is soft and flexible, it doesn't work for slip-on mules where you need a firm, thicker leather to hold its shape. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nThis gold ring has a four prong setting and features an emerald cut lab-grown colorless 3.05 carat diamond. It's a VS1 diamond, meaning it has minor internal defects (called \"inclusions\"), but these are invisible to the naked eye.\n\nOverall, I'd say Quince diamond engagement rings are most worth it for people who like a modestly-sized lab-grown diamond with a simple band. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nRead \n\nEven though these are really subtle and small, the Silver Threader Drop Earrings are a best-seller from Quince's jewelry collection. I gather it's because the style is so easy to put on and forget about — they're extremely lightweight, and made with 925 sterling silver so they won't irritate your skin if you have a nickel allergy. — Gabrielle Chase, senior associate style editor, Insider Reviews\n\nSee \n\nOverall, we found Quince a budget-friendly source for elevated basics. There are many hits (affordable cashmere, comfy dresses), several misses (crumpled linen, flimsy silk, flatly-colored leather), and even more that fall somewhere in between.\n\nOur impression of the brand itself is that it has a lot more to prove when it comes to being consistent, size inclusive, and sustainable. Nevertheless, because its core designs are so classic and simple, Quince makes the cut for what we call luxury-adjacent clothing.",

    "fullText": "In November 2010, Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner attended the opening of the Endless Youth & Life boutique in Beverly Hills.\n\nLauren Sánchez Bezos, who was then working as a TV correspondent, was also there and posed for a photo with the former couple.\n\nThey remained professional acquaintances for more than a decade following the event.\n\nThey posed for a photo together with Jeff Bezos, Kim Kardashian, and Elsa Marie Collins, a cofounder of the This Is About Humanity organization.\n\nThree months prior, it was announced that Bezos had proposed to Sánchez Bezos.\n\nThe This Is About Humanity soiree marked the start of their public engagement and the beginning of Sánchez Bezos' close friendship with the Kardashian-Jenners.\n\nThe couple attended the Los Angeles stop of Beyoncé's Renaissance World Tour in September 2023, as did five members of the Kardashian-Jenner clan.\n\nIn one photo from the concert, Sánchez Bezos is seen embracing Bezos and her friend, Kris Jenner, who stood next to Kim Kardashian and her daughter, North West, as well as Khloé Kardashian and Penelope Disick.\n\nThey saw each other at the Vanity Fair Oscars Party in Beverly Hills, where they welcomed Demi Lovato, Sofía Vergara, and Lenny Kravitz into their circle.\n\nThe night was a big one for Sánchez Bezos, as she displayed a daring, high-fashion look that took her style to new heights: a red Lever Couture ball gown with a plunging neckline.\n\nKris Jenner attended the \"Garden of Time\" event with her longtime partner, Corey Gamble, and Bezos joined his fiancée inside the gala after she walked the red carpet solo.\n\nJenner and Sánchez Bezos both wore Oscar de la Renta, while Gamble sported Dolce & Gabbana. Bezos stuck with a classic tuxedo.\n\nWhen standing together, it looked like the two couples had coordinated their black-and-white outfits.\n\nIn March 2025, for example, Bezos sat between his partner and Kim Kardashian at Chanel's pre-Oscar dinner.\n\nThe Skims founder and Sánchez Bezos both wore subdued black gowns with sleeveless tops that night. Bezos also went with a simple look: a classic black suit with a white undershirt.\n\nOne day after the Chanel dinner, all three entrepreneurs attended the Vanity Fair Oscar Party.\n\nBezos wore a black suit, a white undershirt, a matching bow tie, and a diamond brooch. Sánchez Bezos was there with him, wearing a strapless white Oscar de la Renta ball gown decorated with feathers.\n\nKim Kardashian took a similar approach to her style that night, wearing a white Balenciaga ball gown. Her dress was also strapless.\n\nThe sisters were there with Kris Jenner, as well as Kim and Khloé Kardashian, all of whom wore numerous styles throughout the three-day affair.\n\nKris Jenner and Kim Kardashian were also in attendance for Sánchez Bezos' bachelorette party the previous month.\n\nSánchez Bezos could have been mistaken for one of the Jenner sisters at the Dior dinner that night.\n\nAll three women wore minidresses for the event, with Sánchez Bezos wearing a gray tweed design from the fashion house and Kendall and Kylie Jenner both in black.",

    "fullText": "Jimmy Kimmel is staying with Disney a little longer.\n\nThe late-night host has signed a one-year extension to stay on ABC's \"Jimmy Kimmel Live!\" through May 2027, a person familiar with the deal told Business Insider on Monday.\n\nThe renewed contract comes just months after Kimmel was briefly pulled off the air following backlash over his comments about the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, a controversy that sidelined him for nearly a week and drew widespread concerns over the First Amendment.\n\nIn the episode following Kirk's death in September, among other quips, Kimmel commented on how the president quickly pivoted from talking to reporters about Kirk's death to discussing the construction of the White House's new ballroom.\n\n\"This is not how an adult grieves the murder of somebody he called a friend,\" Kimmel said on his show. \"This is how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.\"\n\nBrendan Carr, the FCC commissioner, publicly condemned Kimmel's comments and warned that affiliate broadcast licenses could be subject to review. Sinclair and Nexstar, which own local TV stations, said that they would preempt Kimmel's show. ABC announced that it would suspend Kimmel's show nationwide \"indefinitely.\"\n\nKimmel was reinstated within a week upon an uproar of support from the entertainment industry. Nexstar and Sinclair ended their boycott of the show soon after.\n\nKimmel himself has also frequently hinted that he may be leaving his late-night show behind. In 2024, he told the Los Angeles Times in an interview that his current deal with Disney may be his \"final contract.\"\n\n\"I hate to even say it, because everyone's laughing at me now,\" Kimmel told the LA Times. \"Each time I think that, and then it turns out to not be the case.\"\n\nUnder the new deal, Kimmel's show, which has been on air since 2003, may shape up to be one of the longest-running late-night shows. Kimmel's show has now been running longer than \"The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,\" \"Late Night with Seth Meyers,\" and \"Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.\"",

    "description": "Luckily for fans who missed their chance, Bon Jovi has added even more dates to their Madison Square Garden residency in July.",
    "fullText": "After a four-year break from the road, Bon Jovi is officially back with the 2026 Forever Tour — Jon Bon Jovi's first full run since his 2022 vocal-cord surgery, a recovery he's discussed as a near career-ender. The tour opens with a nine-show residency at Madison Square Garden in July 2026, followed by stadium dates in Europe, including Edinburgh, Dublin, and three nights at London's Wembley Stadium, which were added due to demand. Keep scrolling to learn how to get Bon Jovi tickets for these shows below.\n\nTo celebrate, the band released Forever (Legendary Edition) on October 24, 2025, a collaborative rework of their 2024 album featuring Bruce Springsteen, Lainey Wilson, Jelly Roll, Jason Isbell, Avril Lavigne, Robbie Williams, and more, plus a new track, \"Red, White & Jersey.\"\n\nIf you’re looking to catch Bon Jovi’s monumental return to the stage for the coming Forever tour, we’ve got you covered. We’ve broken down everything Forever, including the tour schedule, purchasing details, and price comparisons between original and resale tickets. You can also look at ticket details at your leisure on StubHub and Vivid Seats.\n\nBon Jovi’s tour will kick off with an extended nine-show residency at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Following this, the band will head overseas for three shows in Edinburgh, Dublin, and London. The current schedule is set to conclude on September 4.\n\nTickets are available from verified resale vendors such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. As tickets have just gone on sale and demand is high, you may find more favorable seating and pricing options from these sites. We recommend reviewing all available options for the date and location you wish to attend before making your purchase.\n\nPrices vary for Bon Jovi’s upcoming Forever tour depending on the date, location, and demand for each show. On Ticketmaster, original standard tickets, particularly for the New York residency, are in incredibly high demand, with remaining options ranging in the high hundreds to over $1,000 for some premium seating options. In general, the high prices seem to be a result of most affordable seating options having already sold out during the current ongoing presale.\n\nVivid Seats and StubHub, on the other hand, currently offer a wider variety of seating and pricing options, providing more affordable choices overall for those looking to attend the shows on a budget. Both sites have affordable options ranging from $237 to around $300 for the New York performances. Please note that, as of the time of writing, the July 19 New York show, which was most recently announced, has not yet gone on sale. International shows are more affordable on StubHub, starting at £151 for both UK performances, with Vivid Seats offering prices starting at $394. Generally, Vivid Seats tends to offer more limited options for international performances, whereas StubHub often provides a wider variety. The Dublin show is presently not available on either platform.\n\nThere are several VIP packages being offered on Ticketmaster for Bon Jovi’s upcoming Forever tour. Full details of all four packages, the “Legendary” Front Row & Side Stage VIP experience, “Forever” VIP experience, Premium Superfan VIP fan package, and Superfan VIP fan package, can be viewed on Ticketmaster. All packages include premium tickets as well as various perks such as signed merchandise, dedicated VIP staff, VIP lounge access, exclusive gifts, and early entry. Ticketmaster also has limited quantities of VIP packages that include hotel stays as well. We were able to find one Superfan VIP fan package ticket for the July 9 show listed on Ticketmaster for $686 (at the time of writing); however, other shows appear to have no options remaining.\n\nOpeners for the coming Forever tour have not yet been officially announced. In the past, Bon Jovi has regularly supported other artists, including local ones, as openers for their concert tours. Previous years have seen One Republic, Skid Row, Cinderella, Van Halen, Queensrÿche, Daughtry, Kid Rock, and Nickelback support Bon Jovi onstage. With the tour set to start next July, it is expected that more information will become available as the kick-off grows closer.\n\nThe Forever tour will include a five-show residency in New York, followed by three international performances in Edinburgh, Dublin, and London.\n\nBon Jovi’s tour, the Forever tour, is the first in four years and is set to kick off in July 2026. The coming tour marks the first for Bon Jovi since lead singer Jon Bon Jovi underwent vocal cord surgery in 2022.\n\nSince the Forever tour has yet to start, we can't say for certain what songs the band will perform as part of their setlist. Based on their last tour in 2022, here are some songs that might be included in the performance:",

    "description": "See some of the evidence that's emerged in Luigi Mangione's court hearing in Manhattan — from the 911 call to his fake ID.",
    "fullText": "The first two officers arriving at the McDonald's on December 9, 2024 — the fifth day of the nationwide manhunt — had not been expecting much.\n\nNo one believed Thompson's shooter would be in the restaurant — not the two cops, not their supervisor, not even the store manager who'd reluctantly called 911 at their customers' insistence. The call had been dispatched as \"Priority: Low.\"\n\n\"What's your name?\" one of the officers asked, approaching Mangione at the back of the restaurant. \"Uh, Mark,\" Mangione answered, according to sealed police bodycam footage shown in court. He told them he was homeless.\n\nHe then handed over this New Jersey license — listing his name as \"Mark Rosario.\"\n\nMangione was then asked to pull down his blue-and-white paper medical mask, which Altoona patrolman Joseph Detwiler said made Mangioni stand out.\n\n\"We don't wear masks,\" Detwiler told the jury. \"We have antibodies.\"\n\nWhen Mangione's mask was lowered, everything changed. \"I knew it was him immediately,\" testified Detwiler. \"I stayed calm.\"\n\nBodycam footage showed the officer whistling along as Jingle Bell Rock played on the McDonald's sound system — to keep Mangione calm as well, as they ran his license, he told the judge.\n\nDetwiler had closely followed the manhunt for Thompson's killer, the veteran patrolman told New York Supreme Court Justice Gregory Carro from the witness stand.\n\nHe'd said he'd seen NYPD social media postings publicizing the as-yet-unnamed shooting suspect's face. Elsewhere online, he had seen surveillance footage of the shooting, which was played in court.\n\n\"I knew in New York that they hadn't found the firearm,\" Detwiler testified. Safety, he explained, was behind the decision to frisk Mangione and search his backpack before arresting him on the initial Pennsylvania charges of forgery and providing a false ID to law enforcement.\n\nOnce at the Altoona Police station, a more thorough search of Mangione's backpack, pockets, clothing, and other belongings was conducted. Officers found this folded scrap of lined paper, filled with writing and diagrams in pencil.\n\nPart doodled map, part to-do list, it is filled with dates and tasks, only some of which were accomplished. Under \"12/8,\" the words \"Best buy\" had been crossed off, as were mentions of a USB drive, \"digital cam,\" and \"light source.\"\n\n\"Hot meal\" and \"water bottles\" were also crossed off.\n\nOther items on the list — including \"AAA bats\" and \"survival kit,\" under the date 12/9, the day of his arrest — were not crossed out.\n\nAt the Altoona police station, cops recovered $7,800 in large bills and currency from Thailand, Japan, and India, totaling $1,620, from Mangioni's backpack. \n\n\"There's a weapon,\" Patrolwoman Christy Wasser is heard saying soon after, in footage showing her continuing to search Mangione's backpack.\n\nGiven the gun and the at-first-overlooked knife, the decision was made to strip-search Mangione.",

With all venues in stadiums and a long roster of opening acts scheduled to join the star, it’s no wonder tickets are already in high demand.\n\nLuke Combs has been praised for his dedication to his fans, and releasing the tour announcement and presale first to his Bootleggers fans has been specifically applauded. The “Fast Car” singer has been quoted as saying he is happy for the chance to promote country music in places where it is not typically found, and his 10 international stops can attest to that effort as well.\n\nIf seeing Luke Combs in concert next year sounds like your kind of Saturday night, we’ve got you covered. We’ve broken down everything Luke Combs and the My Kinda Saturday Night world tour, including purchasing details and price comparisons between ticket vendors. You can also browse concert and ticket specifics at your convenience on StubHub or Vivid Seats.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour will kick off in Las Vegas next March, followed by several shows across the continental US and Canada. From July, Combs will embark on a tour of Europe and the UK. The My Kinda Saturday Night tour is scheduled to wrap up on August 2 in London.\n\n*Indicates an event that Luke Combs will be performing at in addition to other artists.\n\nOriginal tickets for the My Kinda Saturday Night tour went on presale on October 15, followed by general sale on October 17, with tickets available for purchase on Ticketmaster. As of writing, all dates still have limited availability for original tickets, and can still be purchased on Ticketmaster.\n\nTickets are also available for purchase from verified resale vendor sites such as StubHub and Vivid Seats. Many popular tour stops, such as Las Vegas, have limited remaining seating options; in such cases, you may find more ideal options on resale sites instead.\n\nWith shows still having yet to sell out, ticket prices between the original and resale options are somewhat similar, with resale options leaning slightly more affordable for certain dates. Original standard ticket prices vary depending on the venue and location, but currently tend to fall within the average range of $100 to just over $300. Many locations even offer pit options under $300 (Knoxville and South Bend, for example), which is very reasonable compared to other artists whose pit tickets can easily exceed $1,000.\n\nAs of writing, for the resale option, Vivid Seats has prices ever so slightly below those of StubHub, with the most affordable options ranging from $71 for the May 2 tour stop in Knoxville to $176 for the May 30 tour stop in Montreal. StubHub ranges from $79 for the same Knoxville show to $244 for the Green Bay performance on May 16. The biggest difference right now is that Vivid Seats has fewer international location options, which is somewhat common for the site in general.\n\nLuke Combs has a guest appearance at Alan Jackson’s event in Nashville on June 27, and prices for this are considerably higher than his own headlining tour’s stops. This is due to the event being large, with several artists performing.\n\nThere are no VIP packages for The My Kind Of Saturday Night tour available for purchase on Ticketmaster.\n\nSeveral artists have been confirmed to join Luke Combs on his upcoming 2026 world tour. For North American shows, Dierks Bentley, Ty Myers, The Castellows, and Thelma & James have been tapped as supporting artists. Europe will continue to see Ty Myers and the Castellows perform, with The Script also joining them for shows in Sweden, the Netherlands, and Ireland. The Teskey Brothers have been announced as an opening act for the Edinburgh show, and Thomas Rhett will also be supporting the London concert.\n\nThe My Kinda Saturday Night tour has 10 international dates currently scheduled. The tour will head to Sweden in July, followed by shows in France, the Netherlands, and Ireland, and will conclude in the UK with five performances in Edinburgh and London.\n\nLuke Combs is an American country singer from North Carolina who first emerged on the scene in 2014 with his debut EP, “The Way She Rides”. He has since gone on to win several Billboard Music and Country Music awards, and also has his own polarized sunglasses and hat company called Blue Otter Polarized. Luke Combs married Nicole Hocking in 2020.",

    "description": "In seeking to buy Warner Brothers for $108 billion, Paramount is making one of the top ten largest hostile takeover bids in history.",
    "fullText": "Paramount Skydance's bid to purchase Warner Bros. Discovery is a big deal — literally.\n\nThe all-cash offer of $30 per share works out to a valuation of more than $108 billion, or an equity valuation of $78.7 billion, for WBD's entire operation, putting it in the upper echelons of hostile takeover attempts in recent decades.\n\nIn fairness, the $82.7 billion deal, or $72 billion equity valuation, from streaming giant Netflix is also pretty massive. That was the one WBD's board had agreed on, and it excluded certain pieces of the business.\n\n\"We are taking our offer directly to shareholders to give them the opportunity to act in their own best interests and maximize the value of their shares.\" Paramount CEO David Ellison said in a statement.\n\nTo get a sense of the biggest hostile takeover deals of the past 30 years, Business Insider asked financial analytics provider Dealogic to pull the numbers.\n\nHere are the equity valuations of the 14 largest hostile takeover announcements since 1995, and where the Paramount deal for WBD would fit in.\n\nComcast launched an unsolicited bid for AT&T Broadband, which was then the largest cable operator in the US. After a few rounds of negotiations and pressure from shareholders, AT&T accepted the offer. The deal gave rise to Comcast's national expansion.\n\nThe billionaire CEO of Tesla made an unsolicited offer to buy Twitter after building a large stake. Twitter initially resisted, but eventually accepted the deal. Musk, however, tried to back out of the deal and was met with litigation, before eventually closing the takeover he started. Musk had since then changed the platform's algorithm, its name, and content moderation rules.\n\nIn what was at the time Europe's largest hostile takeover, RBS and Bank of Scotland fought in a bidding war for NatWest, which ended with RBS's victory through a hostile offer. The deal helped RBS become a global banking giant, but at the cost of taking on excessive debt. RBS collapsed during the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nRoche, which already owned a majority stake in Genentech, launched a hostile bid for full ownership. The biotech company initially resisted the attempt due to undervaluation. After raising the offer, Roche succeeded.\n\nBAT made an unsolicited offer to buy the remainder of Reynolds, after already owning a large stake in it. Reynolds negotiated a higher price but ultimately accepted the takeover. The deal created the world's largest publicly traded tobacco company at the time.\n\nBelgium's InBev made a hostile offer for Anheuser-Busch, the parent company of beer brand Budweiser. AB's management and founding family initially resisted being taken over by a foreign company, but shareholders pressured them to accept after InBev raised its bid.\n\nBayer made an unsolicited offer to Monsanto, and the chemical company held out for a higher price before accepting the deal. Unfortunately for Bayer, the German biotech company also inherited lawsuits against Monsanto's Roundup herbicide.\n\nTotalFina launched a hostile bid for Elf in a dramatic French corporate battle. After nearly a year of fighting and regulatory scrutiny, the companies merged and became one of the world's biggest oil companies. The combined entity was eventually renamed as TotalEnergies.\n\nJapanese company Takeda made a series of unsolicited bids for UK-based Shire. Shire repeatedly rejected the deal until Takeda substantially increased the offer. This is one of the largest acquisitions ever made by a Japanese company, and it gave Takeda a large rare disease drug portfolio.\n\nSanofi's unsolicited takeover was met with strong resistance from Aventis, so much so that the company sought to be acquired by a different pharmaceutical giant, Novartis. Sanofi sweetened the offer, and Aventis eventually accepted it.\n\nParamount launched its hostile takeover bid after WBD's board bypassed its offers in favor of a deal with Netflix.\n\nPfizer launched a hostile bid to break apart Warner-Lambert's agreed merger with American Home Products. Warner-Lambert fought back but ultimately conceded. This gave Pfizer full ownership of Lipitor, which holds the record for the highest lifetime sales for a single drug.\n\nImmediately before the 2008 financial crisis, Barclays tried to acquire ABN AMRO amicably, but RBS, alongside Fortis and Banco Santander, countered with a hostile, higher bid and won. The acquisition sped up RBS's collapse soon after.\n\nIn a move that consolidated much of the world's beer industry under one entity, AB InBev launched a hostile offer for SABMiller, eventually raising the bid to satisfy resistant shareholders.\n\nUK company Vodafone AirTouch launched a hostile bid for German company Mannesmann, which had rapidly become one of Europe's most valuable telecom companies. Mannesmann fiercely resisted, framing the bid as an attack on German industrial values and national pride. The record-setting battle lasted three months, ending with Vodafone winning by raising the bid.",

    "fullText": "President Donald Trump said he wanted to \"do what's right\" in the media war brewing between Netflix, Paramount, and Warner Bros. Discovery.\n\nOn Friday, Netflix said that it would acquire WBD for $72 billion. WBD rejected Paramount Skydance's offers and proceeded with a sale to Netflix. But on Monday, Paramount launched a hostile bid, with a $30-per-share offer for all of WBD.\n\nIn response to a question from a reporter about the fight for WBD on Monday, Trump said, \"I know the companies very well. I know what they're doing, but I have to see, I have to see what percentage of market they have.\"\n\n\"We have to see the Netflix percentage of market, Paramount, the percentage of market,\" he said during a roundtable at the White House. \"I mean, none of them are particularly great friends of mine, you know.\"\n\n\"I want to do what's right. It's so, so very important to do what's right,\" he added.\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he would be involved in the sale of WBD, and that the combined market share of Netflix and WBD \"could be a problem.\"\n\nBut he also said that Netflix's CEO, Ted Sarandos, was a \"great person\" who has done \"one of the greatest jobs in the history of movies.\"\n\nTrump's involvement in the media war is significant because he has the authority to stop a deal from taking place. In 2017, he voiced his opposition to AT&T's proposed acquisition of Time Warner.\n\nBusiness Insider's media and tech correspondent, Peter Kafka, wrote in a column last week that a deal to buy WBD would need regulatory approval, which in 2025 is synonymous with Trump's approval.\n\nParamount is putting up a strong fight for Warner Bros. Its CEO, David Ellison, pitched the WBD offer to his employees in a Monday memo seen by Business Insider.\n\n\"We believe the combination of Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery represents a powerful opportunity to strengthen both companies and the entertainment industry as a whole,\" Ellison's memo wrote.",

In 2003, he called Freddie \"Frauddie Mac\" in an investor letter and bought credit-default swaps that would pay off if the company faltered.\n\nNow in 2025, Burry argues the landscape has changed. Fannie and Freddie have rebuilt tens of billions in capital since 2021 and remain essential pillars of the US mortgage market, owning 62% of outstanding home loans.\n\nWith the Trump administration now signaling interest in releasing them from conservatorship, Burry believes their IPOs may be nearing.\n\nHowever, \"there remains a final steep, windy and rocky climb to IPO for both,\" he wrote, citing regulatory and policy roadblocks.\n\nShares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which trade over the counter, rose 2% and 2.4%, respectively, on Monday.\n\nBurry's post came a month after he closed his hedge fund to outside investors, after terminating Scion Asset Management's SEC registration.\n\nSince then, he has launched his \"Cassandra Unchained\" Substack that promises a \"front row seat to his analytical efforts and projections for stocks, markets, and bubbles, often with an eye to history and its remarkably timeless patterns.\" It now has over 146,000 subscribers.",

    "fullText": "Jamie Dimon said AI could one day help us work less, but not before it cuts jobs.\n\nThe JPMorgan CEO said in an interview with Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that AI could improve society, comparing it to past technological leaps that lifted productivity and living standards.\n\n\"Maybe one day we'll be working less hard, but having wonderful lives,\" he said.\n\nBut getting there won't be painless. While AI will not \"dramatically reduce\" jobs in the next year, \"it will eliminate jobs,\" Dimon said.\n\n\"It doesn't mean people won't have other jobs,\" he said, adding that workers should lean into critical thinking, communication, and emotional intelligence.\n\nThe real danger, he said, is that AI adoption could outpace society's ability to train workers.\n\n\"If it does happen too fast for society, which is possible, we can't assimilate all those people that quickly,\" Dimon said.\n\nGovernment, companies, and society \"should look at how do we phase it in a way that we don't damage a lot of people,\" he added.\n\nDimon has been optimistic about the long-term potential of AI. Last month, he said AI would shrink the workweek.\n\n\"My guess is the developed world will be working three and a half days a week in 20, 30, 40 years,\" Dimon said in November at the America Business Forum in Miami.\n\n\"You're going to have agents that do research for you every time you wake up in the morning,\" he added.\n\nDimon hasn't downplayed the risks, either. At a Fortune-hosted conference last month, he warned that job elimination is inevitable. \"People should stop sticking their heads in the sand,\" he said.\n\nOther big bank CEOs have also said that AI has long-term benefits, but they highlighted the disruption ahead.\n\nGoldman Sachs CEO David Solomon said in an interview on CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" in October that AI will lead to shifting job functions, but \"at the end of the day, we have an incredibly flexible, nimble economy.\"\n\n\"I'm excited about it,\" he said, adding that he sees \"lots of opportunities for our business.\"\n\nThe CEO of Wells Fargo, Charles Scharf, echoed that view. He told Reuters last month that \"the opportunities that exist in AI are very significant.\"\n\n\"Anyone who sits here today and says that they don't think they'll have less head count because of AI either doesn't know what they're talking about or is just not being totally honest about it,\" he said.",

Last week, it announced partnerships with media giants CNN and CNBC, and said that it raised $1 billion at a valuation of $11 billion.\n\nPolymarket, its blockchain-enabled competitor, was founded in 2020 and offers similar services. It was last valued at $13.5 billion in November, per PitchBook.\n\nThe popularity of prediction platforms has exploded since a legal victory for Kalshi in the US last fall. Now, users can bet on questions ranging from the popularity of Labubu dolls to Elon Musk's net worth.\n\nLast year, Mansour said in an interview that his employees asked social media influencers to promote memes about an FBI raid on the home of Polymarket CEO Shayne Coplan. On Monday's podcast, Mansour called the move a \"mistake\" and said he \"made clear to the team: 'Don't ever do this again.'\"\n\nMansour also compared the two companies to soccer stars Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, and said that it was not a coincidence that the two \"greatest\" players exist in the same era.\n\n\"Without Polymarket, we wouldn't have pushed our marketing and pushed our product as hard,\" he said. \"That sort of infighting is going to push both of us to scale this industry and reach heights that we honestly wouldn't have been able to otherwise, which long-term is actually net positive for the customer.\"\n\nPolymarket did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment about Mansour's comparisons.",

    "fullText": "The tech industry has spent the past year racing to build AI agents, but Anthropic researchers say a simpler idea can make AI more effective on the job.\n\nBarry Zhang and Mahesh Murag said at the AI Engineering Code Summit last month that the real breakthrough for agent workflow isn't more agents, but \"agent skills.\"\n\n\"We used to think agents in different domains will look very different,\" Zhang said in a clip of the talk published Monday. \"The agent underneath is actually more universal than we thought.\"\n\nInstead of building new agents for every use case, companies should rely on a single general agent powered by a library of skills, Zhang said.\n\nSkills are \"organized collections of files that package composable procedural knowledge for agents,\" Zhang said. They are simply folders that contain whatever an agent needs to complete a task consistently and efficiently.\n\nDespite their intelligence, Zhang said today's agents \"lack expertise\" and often miss important context in real-world use cases. Skills help fill in those gaps by giving agents domain knowledge and reusable workflows.\n\nMurag said Anthropic has already seen skills built by people in accounting, legal, recruiting, and other non-technical roles. In the five weeks since launch, users have created thousands of these skills, and large companies are starting to treat them like internal playbooks for AI, he added.\n\nFortune 100 companies are using skills to \"teach agents about their organizational best practices,\" Murag said.\n\nTech leaders have described AI agents as a potential game-changer for office work. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in June that AI agents are already performing tasks that are normally done by junior-level employees.\n\n\"You hear people that talk about their job now is to assign work to a bunch of agents, look at the quality, figure out how it fits together, give feedback, and it sounds a lot like how they work with a team of still relatively junior employees,\" Altman said of AI agents at the Snowflake Summit 2025.\n\nWe'll \"start to see agents that can help us discover new knowledge, or can figure out solutions to business problems that are kind of very non-trivial,\" Altman added.\n\nMicrosoft's AI platform product lead Asha Sharma said in an episode of \"Lenny's Podcast\" in August that AI agents could flatten corporate hierarchies.\n\n\"The whole kind of organizational construct might start to look different in a few years,\" he said. \"You just don't need as many layers.\"\n\nBut some people in the industry have said agents have been overhyped.\n\nGuido Appenzeller, a partner at a16z, said on a company podcast episode in May that some startups are simply adding a chat interface to a language model and calling it an agent so they can charge more.\n\n\"A couple of startups are basically saying, 'Hey, we can price this software that we're building much, much higher because this is an agent,'\" he said, adding that \"there's a marketing angle to agents.\"",

Authenticity is not a fixed trait; it is co-created through interactions among influencers, brands, followers, and agencies, and hinges on five key dimensions: expertise, connectedness, integrity, originality, and transparency. When these dimensions are misaligned—such as when brands prioritize reach over relevance or influencers conceal financial motives—authenticity breaks down and trust erodes.

    "title": "Use the 'MIT Method' to Keep Your Big-Picture Goals in Mind During Everyday Tasks",
    "description": "Don't prioritize your tasks by what will take the most time—try choosing what will have the biggest impact.",
    "fullText": "So many productivity methods ask you to prioritize your daily tasks by considering how much time or effort they'll require, then tackling the resource-heavy ones first. For some people, that's a solid strategy, since you can definitely get some motivation from getting your toughest, most demanding responsibilities out of the way. There's even a weird name for doing that: \"Eating the frog.\" But you can also find motivation in working toward a bigger goal, so what if you prioritized your tasks based on importance and impact, no matter how big or small they are?\n\nThat's what the Most Important Task (MIT) method involves: rather than thinking of specific tasks and how long they'll take, the MIT method asks you to look more broadly at the overall goal you're trying to accomplish. Reframing your approach to productivity by focusing on your goal instead can motivate you to get more done and achieve better results.\n\nFirst, you'll need to nail down your goals. You can set SMART goals or combine the MIT method with the Results Planning Method (RPM), which asks you to consider your purpose when planning your day. Take some time to write down your goals—the big ones, the ones that all your daily tasks are ostensibly supposed to move you toward. Think of weekly goals, monthly goals, and annual goals, as well as ongoing, long-term ones. Write these down or just keep them in mind, but always think about the broader, bigger picture. An easy example is school: You're not just studying so you can pass the test, but because your overall goal is to graduate, to do so with a solid GPA, and to get a quality job offer. Taking time to reaffirm that broader goal reframes how you view studying for one boring old test.\n\nEvery morning, make a list of two or three Most Important Tasks for the day. These are critical tasks that will have an impact on your goals, but they don't have to be huge or resource-draining. If answering emails from a potential client will move you toward a monthly sales goal, that is more of an MIT goal than building a presentation for your boss, even though creating the presentation seems like the more demanding, large-scale project. Consider the results of your tasks and prioritize those that have fast or meaningful ones. You want to focus on the two or three tasks that will actually make a difference in moving you toward your goal.\n\nTake care of those two or three tasks first, then handle other, less important tasks from your to-do list for the rest of the day. You can use a scheduling technique like the 1-3-5 list or the pickle jar method to figure out which those are and how much time and energy you'll have for them. When using the MIT technique, you should also use a productivity journal to write down your daily to-dos in the morning and reflections on how it all went at night. If you're not familiar, learn how to conduct an after-action review so you have some structure to follow while reflecting and you can efficiently build on whatever takeaways you find. That nighttime reflection is key: You need to be able to identify and see how taking on those critical tasks impacts your progress toward your goal, plus what you did well and what you could do better as you keep striving. That will keep you motivated and moving forward.",

    "title": "Two Productivity Techniques That Can Help You Do More (by Actually Doing Less)",
    "description": "Let's make your to-dos a little easier, shall we?",
    "fullText": "Not every productivity method works for every person. That's why there are so many out there, and it's also why you need to spend time figuring out which ones might work for you, even if you have to alter or adapt them a little bit. When you're facing down an unusually big or overwhelming task, the traditional methods that you usually rely on may not be helpful. Why not try a one-two punch, combining two I like a lot to make it easier?\n\nFirst, let's try the one-bite technique. This takes a little pre-planning, but can help you out when a task feels daunting. Grab a piece of paper (or use a digital document) and write down your task. Let's say it's leading a quarterly meeting at work. Next, break it down into the smaller tasks that make it up, which could be coordinating the attendees, setting an agenda, making sure the tech and meeting space are order, and keeping track of what is said during the meeting.\n\nFrom there, keep breaking it all down. Coordinating attendees means not only sending out calendar invites, but determining who should get one and staying on top of the lists of who accepted and declined, as well as sending out or scheduling meeting reminders for everyone. Determining the agenda means checking in with presenters and managers on what they're able to present as well as simply writing down a list of topics to go over and allotting the right amount of time to each. Checking on the tech and meeting space mean coordinating with IT, renting the meeting room, checking that your digital meeting space subscription is paid up, and ensuring you'll have enough seats for all attendees. Keeping track of what is said involves designating a note-taker, making sure the AI transcription service is paid for and functioning, setting up a recording system, and creating a timeline and work flow to make sure minutes are distributed to necessary parties in a timely, efficient way when the meeting ends.\n\nObviously, when you take on the responsibility of setting up a meeting, you know these are all the things you'll need to do, but if you look at the task as one big thing—\"run the meeting\"—instead of consciously breaking it down into smaller duties, you're more likely to get overwhelmed. This is true for everything, from planning a vacation to cleaning the house. Training yourself to break tasks down into smaller \"bites\" instead of just launching into work on the larger product will not only help you keep everything running smoothly, but will motivate you, too: As you see smaller tasks getting done, you'll feel accomplished and prepared to keep going.\n\nThis is similar to the \"one more\" trick, which asks you to consider whether you can do \"one more\" thing every time you mark off a small accomplishment. I use \"one more\" when I'm cleaning now that I have consistently failed for years to follow a stricter cleaning schedule—and it works fabulously. Acquainting yourself with the various ways tasks can be broken down and approached can help you in your personal, professional, academic, and social lives. Below is another way you can do that if you're focusing on \"bites\" and need a touch of structure for your next steps.\n\nBreaking down the \"bites\" of your task isn't enough. You do have to actually complete the bites. When there's a lot to do, it can be hard to make yourself do it or know where to start.\n\nYou have to start by determining the order in which you'll tackle your bites. There are a few easy ways to do this with the easiest being the ABCDE method (where you assign subjective grades to each duty quickly, then start working), and a more complex, but objective, option being the Eisenhower matrix. Pick one and just get it done because you have to get started on the bites.\n\nIf you were using a traditional productivity technique, like the Pomodoro method, you'd start off by working for 25 minutes straight and then taking a five-minute break. That can be daunting, though. Frankly, 25 minutes is a lot of time when you're stressed, even if you've figured out a loose gameplan with one of the prioritization techniques above.\n\nInstead, try the \"reverse Pomodoro\" method, which is just like its namesake, except switched around. Instead of working for 25 minutes and getting a tiny break, you work for five, then get a big break. It might seem counterproductive since working for five minutes and relaxing for 20 or 25 means you have a lot of downtime, but it's helpful if you're truly having a hard time getting into the flow of working. People who've tried this method praise it for helping them take the anxiety out of working on a big project because even though there's a lot of chilling out, work is getting done in those five minutes. Eventually, once you have a few tasks completed, you'll be feeling better about the project overall. Don't be surprised if you suddenly feel like you can slog it out for longer than five minutes at a time and slowly move into a more traditional Pomodoro framework to finish up the task. To be honest with you, it's a bit of a mental trick and is similar to the \"one more\" rule mentioned above. Whenever I tell myself I'll just do one thing, then chill, I always end up doing much more just because I feel more accomplished after the first few minutes. If you have to bamboozle your brain a little, so be it.\n\nYou can reap maximum benefits here by first breaking down your task into those small bites, then completing one bite per reverse-Pomodoro work slot. It's five minutes to email the meeting invitation, then a break. Five minutes to have IT check out the tech connections in the meeting room, then a break. Five minutes to draw up a schedule and pass it around, then a break. It's not cheating to focus on your downtime, especially if you're not being productive enough when you try to work for 25 minutes straight. In fact, breaks and downtime are essential to productivity overall. It's better to get something done than nothing and once you start racking up those somethings, you'll feel motivated to sprint to the finish line.",

    "title": "What the Netflix/Warner Bros. Merger Could Mean for Streaming",
    "description": "Is HBO Max dead, and will you be able to watch 'Game of Thrones' on Netflix?",
    "fullText": "After initial reporting from The Wrap revealed that Netflix had won the bidding war for Warner Bros., the streamer stepped in on Friday to confirm that it has a deal with the Warner Bros. board to acquire the home of HBO and HBO Max, DC Comics, and Bugs Bunny for $82.7 billion. The acquisition would put an end to merger attempts from the likes of Paramount and Comcast, but it's also far from a done deal.\n\nAccording to Netflix, its acquisition of Warner Bros. will need to wait until at least Q3 2026, to allow room for the previously announced Warner Bros. and Discovery split to go through, as Netflix does not plan to buy the Discovery part of the business (including its cable channels). Additionally, the deal will need to go through regulatory approval. Given these roadblocks, the companies expect \"to close in 12–18 months.\"\n\nThe news of the acquisition follows Warner Bros.' announcement in October that it was open to a sale, at least partially motivated by its split with Discovery.\n\nWhat happens next isn't entirely clear. The Wrap reported that Netflix's deal with Warner Bros. includes a $5 billion breakup fee in case regulators block the deal, pointing to some anxiety from both companies. To that end, CNBC reported that \"a senior [Trump] administration official\" has said that the government is looking at the merger with \"heavy skepticism,\" and The New York Post and the Wall Street Journal both reported that Paramount (which recently completed its own merger with Skydance Entertainment, led by Trump ally David Ellison) is currently warning the administration away from allowing the deal. To that end, the BBC reported over the weekend that Trump said the merger \"could be a problem.\"\n\nParamount is also not done bidding, it seems. The company announced a $108.4 billion hostile takeover bid this morning, bypassing the board and offering to buy Warner Bros. Discovery shares from shareholders at a premium. Notably, if accepted, the deal would include the whole of Warner Bros. Discovery, despite the upcoming split, which would also give Paramount access to cable networks like CNN and TBS. In its announcement, Paramount called out the Netflix deal as facing a \"challenging regulatory approval process,\" implying that it would better be able to negotiate with the administration.\n\nHow regulators will respond to the purchase remains to be seen, but if the deal does go through, it will mark a major shift for both Hollywood and consumers. Netflix hasn't laid out complete plans for how the merger would affects its customers, but in its press release, it has offered a few hints. Should a combined Netflix and Warner Bros. come to pass, here's how you can expect it to affect you.\n\nSince Netflix's primary business is as a streaming app, the most obvious result of a Warner Bros. acquisition would probably be the shuttering of HBO Max, and the inclusion of its content into Netflix proper. However, it seems like we're more likely to get a Disney+/Hulu situation, with the company running both services simultaneously.\n\nIn its post announcing the merger, Netflix said it will \"maintain Warner Bros.' current operations,\" and that HBO and HBO Max would be viewed as a \"compelling, complementary offering\" for its customers.\n\nWhether that means Netflix subscribers will get complementary HBO subscriptions, or if they will simply be able to add HBO onto their plans as complemental \"content,\" is unclear, although I would expect the latter interpretation to be the correct one. After all, Disney charges an additional fee for users who also want to There would be little reason for Netflix to not follow suit.\n\nThis is backed up by another line further into the press release which states that, \"[b]y adding the deep film and TV libraries and HBO and HBO Max programming, Netflix members will have even more high-quality titles from which to choose.\" That implies HBO is something you'll add to an existing subscription, rather than content that will just become part of a base Netflix subscription, with the company saying the acquisition \"also allows Netflix to optimize its plans for consumers.\"\n\nNetflix already offers a small smattering of shows originally developed for either HBO or HBO Max, such as Sex and the City and Scavenger's Reign. This is due to pre-existing content sharing agreements, but it's possible Netflix may continue to offer some HBO content to its existing subscribers for free, even if it continues to operate HBO as a separate entity.\n\nFor instance, Netflix says in the merger announcement that \"shows and movies such as The Big Bang Theory, The Sopranos, Game of Thrones, The Wizard of Oz and the DC Universe will join Netflix's extensive portfolio.\" While this is likely simply acknowledging acquired IP, I wouldn't be surprised to see some select shows hit Netflix from time to time, either to prop up sparse release schedules or to promote HBO subscriptions/add-ons.\n\nNetflix co-CEO Greg Peters also says in the release that, \"[w]ith our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they [Warner Bros.] create.\" He adds this would be an opportunity to attract, \"more fans to our best-in-class streaming service.\"\n\nWhile Netflix is most known to consumers as an app, its large selection of original content also means that it operates as a production studio. Netflix says that it will use the acquisition of Warner Bros. production side to \"enhance Netflix's studio capabilities, allowing the Company to significantly expand U.S. production.\"\n\nThis means that viewers might expect to see more original Netflix content in the future, specifically more American-made shows in the vein of Stranger Things, alongside localized foreign programming like Squid Game.\n\nAlongside its movie and TV businesses, Netflix will also be acquiring Warner Bros. Games, a spokesperson confirmed to Game Developer. That means the company will now be responsible for publishing both licensed works, such as the Batman Arkham series, as well as gaming originals, like the Mortal Kombat series. Little is known about how Netflix will handle suddenly being in charge of these longstanding AAA series, but given the company's recent gaming ambitions and its promise to continue Warner Bros. operations as usual, it's likely these titles will continue in some capacity.\n\nIn addition to suddenly stepping into big-budget, AAA gaming, Netflix's acquisition of Warner Bros. also means it's getting control of DC Comics' print business alongside its film and TV businesses, as the publisher is wholly owned by Warner Bros. That's another big step for the company, although given that DC's print business serves largely as the foundation of lucrative IP such as Superman and Batman, it's likely Netflix will do its best to keep operations there as smooth as possible. However, readers might expect some Netflix and DC synergy, similar to when Marvel started publishing new Star Wars comics shortly after Disney acquired Lucasfilm. Batman visiting the Upside-Down from Stranger Things might be more likely than you'd think.\n\nFinally, while Netflix's past movie releases have often relied on direct-to-streaming drops complemented by just enough of a theatrical presence to qualify for awards, Netflix said in its release that it plans to continue distributing Warner Bros. produced movies as usual, \"including theatrical releases for films,\" but that the exclusive theatrical window may shrink. In other words, The Batman 2 probably isn't going to get the Knives Out or KPop Demon Hunters treatment, but theater exclusivity for Warner Bros. movies might not be as long going forward.",

    "description": "An  illustrated guide to the iconic sci-fi saga’s history, lore, and evolution.",
    "fullText": "For more than half a century, audiences have been captivated by the Planet of the Apes—a sprawling sci-fi epic that spans at least three timelines, 3,000 years of history, and a franchise that includes 10 feature films, two TV series, three video games, and dozens of comics and novels. Whether you're a long-time fan trying to make sense of the lore or a newcomer wondering how a talking chimpanzee led to a post-apocalyptic planet dominated by primates, I’ve laid out the Planet of the Apes series by release order, chronological continuity, critical and commercial reception, the technological milestones of ape civilizations, and more.\n\nThis is your illustrated guide to the rise (and fall... and rise again, and fall, etc.) of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nPlanet of the Apes is one of the strangest, most ambitious, and longest-running film franchises in cinema history. Films in the series vary wildly in quality, ambition, competence, and style, but all Apes movies, from the 1968 original to 2024’s Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes, share a narrative focus: a world-shaking conflict between humans and intelligent apes.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (1968): Based on Pierre Boulle’s 1963 sci-fi novel La Planète des Singes, 1968’s Planet of the Apes tells the story of astronaut George Taylor, who crash lands on what he thinks is a distant planet where apes are intelligent and in charge, and the people are dumb slaves.\n\nBeneath the Planet of the Apes (1970): While star Charlton Heston appears in the film briefly, Beneath the Planet of the Apes is really the story of Brent, an astronaut who’s been sent to rescue Taylor.\n\nEscape from the Planet of the Apes (1971): You’d think the annihilation of the entire planet would end the Planet of the Apes series, but no: In Escape, Cornelius, Zira, and Dr. Milo manage to flee the planet on Taylor’s ship before the doomsday bomb explodes; the trio time-travel to 1973.\n\nConquest of the Planet of the Apes (1972): The last two old-school Planet of the Apes movies had lower budgets than their predecessors, and it definitely shows. Lore-wise, Conquest presents a divergent narrative path to explain the development of ape intelligence and other events.\n\nBattle for the Planet of the Apes (1973): In the years since the Ape rebellion in Conquest, a nuclear war has killed most humans; humans and ape relations are good enough, but the fragile detente is broken by human-hating gorilla Aldo.\n\nPlanet of the Apes (2001): After a nearly 30-year hiatus, 2001’s Apes is a thematically and tonally uneven summer blockbuster featuring a by-the-numbers plot, mid-tier action, and an ending that confuses everyone. (The makeup and production design are top-notch, though.)\n\nRise of the Planet of the Apes (2011): This movie blows the dust off the hoary old apes and breathes fresh creative life into a moribund franchise; Rise is a film packed with both action and dignity.\n\nDawn of the Planet of the Apes (2014): Dawn takes place about a decade after the events of the last movie, and apes are definitely on the come-up: It features the most nuanced (and most depressing) take on the conflict between species.\n\nWar for the Planet of the Apes (2017): If the message of Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is “war is inevitable…,” the message of War for the Planet of the Apes is “..and war is hell.” It's a grim movie.\n\nKingdom of the Planet of the Apes (2024): Kingdom explores an ape-dominated world where the few humans left are brainless scavengers (or so it seems). It doesn’t break new ground the way Rise did, but Kingdom opens the way for more Planet of the Apes sequels in the future.\n\nOver more than five decades of films, Planet of the Apes has taken audiences from the shattered ruins of New York City to the tranquil redwood forests of Northern California, and even to entirely different worlds (maybe). This map tracks the primary settings of each movie, showing how the saga’s conflicts play out across Earth.\n\nFrom astronauts overshooting the present by millennia, to apes hurtling back to the 20th century’s hippy era, time travel is integral to the Planet of the Apes, so lets take a look at the franchise’s major temporal tourists, charting when they left, when they arrived, and just how far they jumped.\n\nIf you’re considering a watch order for the Planet of the Apes, \"in order by chronology\" is the worst option—the Apes timeline is simply all over the place. While there are a few moments in the modern quadrilogy (2011–2024) that suggest the films are prequels to the original pentalogy (1968–1973), these are ultimately fan-service Easter eggs; the two series just don’t connect unless you get very creative with time-travel loops and offscreen assumptions. Hell, the first five films don’t connect with themselves unless you get creative with time-travel. So, I got creative with time travel to break down the major historical milestones in the Planet of the Apes Universe, across three timelines. (Four, if you count the self-contained 2001 Planet.)\n\nHere are the Planet of the Apes movies listed in order of the year that each one takes place:\n\nCritics have a love-hate relationship with Planet of the Apes movies. According to Rotten Tomatoes, the “best” Apes movie is War for the Planet of the Apes, which was praised by 94% of critics. The “worst” is Battle for the Planet of the Apes, with only 33% positivity. That’s a big spread!\n\nCritical acceptance is great; but in cynical Hollywood terms, the only measure of a good movie is how much money it makes. By that metric, the “best” Apes movie is the 2001 reboot, Planet of the Apes. Despite mixed review, the movie made $328,049,530.32 in domestic ticket sales (adjusted for inflation), which is even more than the original and the 2014 blockbuster Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.\n\nAny society is defined by its leaders, including ape society, so here is a breakdown of the doctors, generals, and tribal chiefs who have ruled the apes over the last 50 years.\n\nDr. Zaius (Planet of the Apes, Beneath the Planet of the Apes): An orangutan Minister of Science and Defender of the Faith who balances political control with the fear of humanity’s return.\n\nGeneral Ursus (Beneath the Planet of the Apes): This violent gorilla warlord never encountered a problem he couldn’t meet with violence.\n\nDr. Zira (Escape from the Planet of the Apes, 1970): A compassionate and sharp-witted chimpanzee thrust into the role of cultural ambassador between societies on the verge of war, Dr. Zira is the defacto leader of a small band of ape time-travelers.\n\nCaesar (Conquest of the Planet of the Apes, Battle for the Planet of the Apes): The original Caesar is a fiery revolutionary who transforms ape resentment into a successful uprising against humanity.\n\nGeneral Thade (Planet of the Apes, 2001): A sadistic and cunning chimpanzee general obsessed with wiping out humanity.\n\nCaesar (Rise of the Planet of the Apes, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, War for the Planet of the Apes): A hyper-intelligent chimp raised by humans, Caesar’s combination of tactical brilliance, political savvy, raw charisma, and genuine compassion for both apes and humans make him the best overall ape leader.\n\nKoba (2014, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes): A bitter, scarred veteran of human torture and hero of the ape revolution, Koba has been through some shit.\n\nProximus Caesar (Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes): An iron-fisted militarist who twists the past to justify authoritarian rule, Proximus Caesar rules through fear and historical revisionism.\n\nAcross the Planet of the Apes films, the ever-shifting balance of power between apes and humans often comes down to brains as much as brawn. Each installment shows apes using technologies, social systems, and tactics that they’ve either developed or borrowed from humans. From crude tools and simple rules to heavy artillery and complex political structures, these milestones mark the evolving capabilities of ape society over the decades (and timelines) of the franchise. Here's a breakdown of the technological highlights of ape society in each movie.\n\nIf ten feature films isn't enough Apes for you, there's plenty more material out there. The Ape-verse began with a novel, and has grown to include a live-action TV series, a cartoon series, three video games, and dozens of novelizations and comic books.",

    "title": "Samsung's One UI 8.5 Beta Is Now Officially Available",
    "description": "You can sign up for the beta today.",
    "fullText": "If you're getting bored with your Galaxy phone, there are changes on the horizon. Samsung announced One UI 8.5 on Monday, Dec. 8, the latest update for Galaxy devices. At present, this new update is only out in beta, but select Galaxy users can try it out right now. Here's what's new, according to Samsung.\n\nWith One UI 8.5, Quick Share can automatically identify people in photos. While that sounds a bit creepy, the idea is to proactively offer sharing recommendations to the people who are featured in any given photo. Say you hit Quick Share on a family photo you took over the weekend. Rather than manually enter all of the contacts you'd like to share that image with, the feature can identify each, and automatically suggest sending the image to those contacts. It should speed up sharing pictures with groups of people after you take them, but, again, a little unsettling.\n\nThe Gallery app's Photo Assist feature is getting some upgrades in One UI 8.5. As of this version, Photo Assist now supports \"uninterrupted editing.\" That means you can make your AI-generated edits without needing to save in between each change. Previously, each edit would produce an entirely new image, so this makes the feature a bit more like a traditional photo editor. In addition, you'll be able to view all of the AI images you made in your edit history, and choose the one you like the most.\n\nSide note: Samsung says Photo Assist's Generate Edit feature requires an internet connection as well as a Samsung Account login. The feature also places a watermark on the image, so other people will know it was manipulated or generated with AI.\n\nOne UI 8.5 now supports sharing audio to other devices via Auracast, following Google's wider support for the standard back in September. If you have any LE Audio-supported devices, like headphones or speakers, you can use Audio Broadcast to share media from your Galaxy. This isn't limited to music, podcasts, or audio from videos, either, as Samsung says you can also broadcast your Galaxy's microphone to LE Audio devices, too.\n\nThis feature is limited to Galaxy S25 devices, even after One UI 8.5 rolls out to other Galaxy phones.\n\nIf you have a number of Samsung Galaxy devices, you might find Storage Share useful. This One UI 8.5 feature lets you manage your files across other devices, including tablets, PCs and even TVs, in the My Files app on your smartphone.\n\nSamsung is also expanding One UI's security features with this latest beta. The company is rolling out updates to Theft Protection with One UI 8.5, an existing feature that can lock your device if it's lost or stolen. That way, whoever picks it up won't have access to your data, or won't be able to erase the device and set it up as their own. In that same vein, Samsung is also launching Failed Authentication Lock, which locks the display after too many failed verification attempts. If a thief tries too many PIN combinations, or the fingerprint scanner fails too many times, your screen will lock them out.\n\nWhile you can apply for the beta program today, first, consider the risks. Like all beta software, this version of One UI is currently in testing, which means there may be bugs and glitches that could interrupt your experience using your smartphone. If you understand these risks (and back up all important information ahead of time), here's what you need to know.\n\nFirst, this beta is only open for Galaxy S25 users in the U.S., Germany, India, Korea, Poland, and the UK. If you have an S24 or older, you'll need to wait for Samsung to roll out the One UI 8.5 beta more widely, or for the full release down the line.\n\nNext, you'll need to apply to join the beta from the Samsung Members app. If you don't have the app yet, download it from the Play Store, then follow the instructions to enroll in the beta.",

    "title": "How to Spot a ‘Sleeper’ Browser Extension That’s Actually Malware",
    "description": "Benign add-ons can be weaponized with malicious updates after gaining user trust.",
    "fullText": "Malicious extensions do occasionally find their way into the Chrome Web Store (and similar libraries in other browsers) by posing as legitimate add-ons. They are particularly difficult to catch when they are benign to begin with, only morphing into malware after gaining user trust.\n\nThat's what happened with a number of extensions on Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge: researchers at Koi Security identified add-ons across both browsers that operated legitimately for several years before receiving malicious updates that allow hackers to surveil users and collect and exfiltrate sensitive data. The scheme, known as ShadyPanda, reached four million downloads and is still active on Edge.\n\nThreat actors ran a similar campaign targeting Firefox earlier this year: They gained approval for benign extensions mimicking popular crypto wallets, accumulated downloads and positive reviews, and then injected the add-ons with malicious code capable of logging form field inputs, which they used to access and steal crypto assets.\n\nAs Koi Security outlines, ShadyPanda started out as an affiliate scam, with 145 extensions masquerading as wallpaper and productivity apps across the two browsers. The initial phase injected affiliate tracking codes and paid commissions with clicks to eBay, Amazon, and Booking.com and then evolved to hijack and manipulate search results before launching the five extensions in 2018 that would later be converted to malware.\n\nThose add-ons were marked as Featured and Verified in Chrome—one, a cache cleaner known as Clean Master, accrued a 4.8 rating from thousands of reviews. The extensions were updated in 2024 to run malware that could check hourly for new instructions and maintain full browser access, feeding information to ShadyPanda's servers. (These have since been removed from Chrome.)\n\nHackers launched an additional five extensions, including WeTab, to Edge in 2023. Two are comprehensive spyware, and all were still active as of Koi's report.\n\nUnfortunately, malicious extensions are usually pretending to be something else, so a quick visual check of your installed extensions may not reveal a problem. In this case, Koi Security has a list of the extension IDs associated with the ShadyPanda campaign, and you'll have to search for them one by one.\n\nIn Chrome, type chrome://extensions/ into your address bar and hit Enter. Toggle on Developer mode in the top-right corner to reveal the IDs for installed extensions. From here, you can copy and paste each ID into the search bar (Ctrl+F on your PC or Cmd+F on your Mac). If there are no results, your browser is safe. If you do find a malicious add-on, click the Remove button. In Edge, follow the same process from edge://extensions/.\n\nWhile this campaign shows that extensions can be weaponized long after they've been installed, you should still follow best practices for vetting browser add-ons just as you would apps for your device. Check the name carefully, as fraudulent extensions often have names that are nearly identical to trustworthy ones. Review the description for any red flags, such as misspellings and unrelated images. If you see a lot of positive reviews in a short amount of time on a new extension, or if they seem to be reviewing something else entirely, proceed with caution. You can also do additional research, such as a search on Google or Reddit, to see if the extension is legit.",

    "description": "It's the latest Pixel series, now with Pixelsnap (Google's version of MagSafe), new AI features, and the new telephoto lens.",
    "fullText": "Google phones keep offering great value for the money, dropping in price very quickly after their release, including the latest Pixel. The Google Pixel 10, with the 128GB going for $599 (originally $799) and the 256GB for $699 (originally $899), are both at record low prices right now, according to price-tracking tools.\n\nThe Google Pixel 10 is the latest in the series to be released this year, back in September. It's the model under the Pixel 10 Pro, which is also at its lowest price right now and has a much faster chip. As Lifehacker's Associate Tech Editor Michelle Ehrhardt says in her review, the Pixel 10 features a telephoto lens, brings the Pixelsnap (Google's version of MagSafe), and has new AI features. However, the ultrawide lens gets weaker, and there are some problems with the chip for third-party apps (but it can be fixed).\n\nThis Pixel 10 has a lot of the same features you'll find in the Pixel Pro for $150 less, making it a great budget option for those who don't want or need all the fancy specs and features. It comes with a Google Tensor G5 chip, and the camera resolutions are 48MP, 13MP, and 10.8MP for the rear and 10.5MP for the front-facing one. You can expect about 24 hours of battery life, depending on your use.\n\nOne of my favorite things about Pixel phones is the ongoing support for many years. My Pixel 6A still gets all of the updates and tons of AI features that make the phone feel fresh many years later, with the latest ones dropping in September. With the Pixel 10, you'll be getting a quality phone with software updates for a while (as long as seven years).",

    "title": "Coros’s New Beta Update Adds Everything Its Watches Have Been Missing",
    "description": "Music controls, an undo button for lap presses, and more.",
    "fullText": "I like Coros running because they do nearly everything Garmins do, at a lower cost. But there have always been a few areas where they fall short, which I’ve noted in my reviews. Now, that seems to be changing—the most recent beta firmware update adds a critical new feature while fixing some of my pet peeves.\n\nI tried out the new features through a public beta from Coros. You can (On iOS, you'll install a Testflight version of the Coros app, which can then give you access to the firmware update. On Android, you'll need to download the beta app, then go here to access the new beta firmware.) I tested these features out on a Pace 4, and I'm mostly happy with them.\n\nIn my reviews of Coros watches, I’ve always docked a few points for how they handle music. Until recently, the watch could only play music files that you downloaded directly to it. That’s fine if you want to run without your phone, but for me (and many others) it’s an unnecessary annoyance—a smartwatch really should be able to display and control what’s playing on your phone. Garmin and Suunto have long had this capability, and Coros was the only major brand missing it.\n\nBut now it’s here. When you long-press the lap button to view your toolbox, you'll see two different apps. The familiar “music” plays downloaded music, and the new “media control” option does exactly what you’d expect: It shows the track information for whatever is playing on your phone, and it gives you buttons to play, pause, skip, or adjust volume. Was that so hard?\n\nWhen I swapped my Garmin for a Coros this summer, one of my biggest complaints was that Coros watches pause your workout once you’ve completed all the steps. So if you have a 4.5-mile run programmed, but want to total five miles for the day, you have to remember to hit \"resume workout\" after the 4.5-mile run ends. I tend jog through that beep, thinking nothing of it, and then swear at my watch when I realize at the end that the last half-mile never got recorded.\n\nI prefer the way Garmin does it: After you complete a Garmin workout, the activity continues until you decide to manually stop it. Coros has apparently adopted that philosophy, as workouts now roll over into an open segment automatically.\n\nDuring an activity, pressing the lap button starts a new segment of the workout (or advances you to the next segment if you’re following a pre-written workout). I know I’m not the only one who sometimes presses this button by accident, so an “undo” option is nice. Garmin watches added this feature about a year ago. Coros adds it with this update.\n\nUnfortunately the undo isn’t available for every lap button press. I do see it if I’m doing an unstructured workout and mark a lap—hitting the lap button again takes me back to the original lap in progress. But I don’t see an undo function if I’m following a workout that already has lap segments built in, or if I’m doing a strength workout (where the lap button switches between work and rest).\n\nMy most common way of using the strength feature is to start an unstructured workout, then use the lap button to mark the end of each set and the start of my rest time. This way, I can keep track of rests during the workout and I know how many sets I’m doing. I might follow a pre-planned workout, but I never enter exercises from the watch during a workout.\n\nThis is simple enough on Garmin, but on Coros, the watch used to ask me to enter at least a body part for each exercise. So if I’m doing five sets of bench press, I have to select “chest” each time I begin a set. This drove me up the wall, and I stopped using the rest timer at all—which makes the strength feature nearly useless.\n\nAfter the update, I can select a body part at the beginning of the workout, and that remains the active body part while I stop and start my sets. (“Full body” is an option, so I usually choose that one.) During the workout, hitting the start/stop button brings up a menu where I can switch body parts should I care to do so. Suddenly,. using the watch during my strength workouts seems like a viable option, instead of annoying.",

    "description": "Don't get locked into an ecosystem.",
    "fullText": "When it's time to buy a new car, you don't necessarily need to stick with the one you had before. You don't lose your cloud-based photos by switching from Toyota to Subaru, nor will your friends yell at you for ruining the group chat by buying a Kia. That's not the case with smartphones: When you buy an iPhone, it's tough to switch away from it. The same goes for Android: While it's easy enough to switch within the Android ecosystem, such as between Pixel or Galaxy, moving from Android to iPhone can also be a pain. Tech companies tend to make it tempting to stick with their platform, and introduce friction when you try to leave.\n\nThat, of course, is entirely business-based. Apple hasn't traditionally made it easy to move to Android, because, well, you might actually do it. It doesn't have to be this way, either. There's nothing inherent to smartphones that should make it so challenging to break out of any particular ecosystem. All it takes is some intentional design: If smartphones were made to be traded, you could migrate from one to another, without worrying about losing pictures, messages, or any other important data or processes.\n\nAs it happens, that intentional design may be on the horizon. As reported by 9to5Google, Apple and Google are actually working together to make it easier to transfer data between iPhone and Androids, which would make switching between the two platforms more seamless. This isn't theoretical, either: Google has already released some of this progress as part of the latest Android Canary, the company's earliest pre-release software. All compatible Pixel devices can currently access this latest build, though it doesn't seem there are any user-facing features available to test. 9to5Google says that similar features will roll out to testers in a future iOS 26 beta. Perhaps at that time, Google will roll out its features to the Android beta as well, which has a much larger user base than Canary.\n\nWhile details are slim here, any cooperation between Apple and Google on this front is huge. Current migration tools do exist, but they can be problematic. By actually working together on a native transfer solution, it might actually be seamless to move between platforms. Apple and Google might not be motivated by charity, of course, as the EU has been cracking down on restrictive practices by tech companies in recent years. But while both companies may see this as a way to lose customers, it's also a way to gain them: Sure, some iPhone users may switch to Android if it's easier to do so, but some Android users may do the reverse for the same reasons.\n\nMore choice is good for everyone—even if it doesn't guarantee exponential growth to shareholders.",

    "description": "Lando Norris has joined an illustrious sporting club, and is only just getting going at the very peak of F1, writes Andrew Benson.",
    "fullText": "With his first Formula 1 world championship, Lando Norris joins an illustrious sporting club.\n\nOnly 35 drivers in the 75-year history of the sport have won the F1 title, and 11 of them - by far the largest number from a single country - are, like Norris, from the UK.\n\nAll of them are different, wrote larger or smaller chapters in the history of the sport. From Lewis Hamilton, the most successful driver of all time, with seven titles and 105 wins, to the one-time winners such as Mike Hawthorn, John Surtees, James Hunt and Damon Hill - who, like Jenson Button, was in Abu Dhabi to watch Norris secure his crown.\n\nOn Sunday night in Yas Marina, the game everyone who watches and enjoys sport likes to play had already started. Where does this achievement stand in the annals? How good is Norris?\n\nIn truth, this starts as a soon as a sportsperson arrives on the scene, especially when it's apparent they are heading for the top. And it has always been clear that Norris was. His level of talent and pace have always marked him out as a future world champion.\n\nFrom there, in F1, as in all elite sport, it's about fine margins, not just how fast a driver is, but how consistently they can achieve their best level, how few mistakes they make on the way.\n\nAnd Norris, although already seven seasons into his F1 career, is only just getting going at the very peak of the sport.\n\nHe has had an absolutely competitive car only for a season and a half, a very good one only for a year more than that. And at 26, he has many more years of running at the front to come. His story, the assessment of his standing, is in its early stages.\n\nThis year, Norris has gone toe to toe with Red Bull's Max Verstappen, acknowledged widely as the finest driver of his generation, the one who most consistently takes his equipment to the very edge of the possible.\n\nNorris has won that battle, by two points over the Dutchman, and 13 over his McLaren team-mate Oscar Piastri, after a season that has ebbed and flowed between the three of them.\n\nAnd Norris knows what's coming now.\n\n\"I hate ever having to try and compare myself to other people,\" he said on Sunday night. \"This is all for you guys to decide, whether someone's better than someone else or not.\n\n\"All I try and do every weekend is the best of what I can. But then you decide 'he's better than him, or he's got a worse car and he's doing better'. Write what you like, decide what you like.\n\n\"I certainly feel like at moments I've driven better than I feel like other people can. And I feel like I drove at a level I don't think other people can match.\n\n\"But have I also made my mistakes? Have I made more mistakes than other people at times? Yes. Is there stuff Max could do better at times than me? Yes. Do I believe he's unbeatable? No.\n\n\"But you also don't know, do you? It's hard to know.\n\n\"Like, they also struggled with the car in the mid part of the season. They've had an incredible second half of the season.\n\n\"They took advantage of the fact we had two of us fighting for a world championship. He really made the most of that, and Max drove like he is a four-time world champion. And I'm very happy that I got to race against him and try to prove myself against him.\"",

    "fullText": "I have spoken to England captain Ben Stokes in the immediate aftermath of two defeats on this Ashes tour.\n\nThe Stokes I encountered after the loss in Brisbane was completely different to the man in front of me following the defeat in Perth.\n\nIt was clear he had things to say. Stokes was looking beyond the person holding the microphone and instead speaking to fans at home. There was a clear point he wanted to get across, and he did it very powerfully.\n\nTo me, the Bazball message is dead. That does not mean the personnel has to change or regimes need to be swept aside – those decisions will come at the end of the series – but it means there has been a realisation by England that the way in which they play their Test cricket must be altered.\n\nThe philosophy of Stokes and Brendon McCullum was necessary when they took over the England team in 2022. It was a breath of fresh air.\n\nBut it was also unsustainable. It was straightforward for good teams to work out. Somewhere along the way, the rhetoric ran away from England. It got out of control and cost them matches.\n\nNow, there is a sense Stokes has observed something in the Australia team. When Stokes said his dressing room is \"not a place for weak men\", he was making a comparison to the way Australia play their cricket.\n\nThere are no loose shots, there is a willingness to soak up pressure, to not leave the job to the next man.\n\nHowever, if Stokes and McCullum are questioning the mindset of the players, they have to look at themselves.\n\nHave England got into this situation because of a feeling of pressure or expectation to play in a certain way?\n\nWhen England have fallen in a heap, it is usually because of the batting. Have the players been able to bat in a way that is comfortable for them, or have they been acting out of an obligation to conform?",

    "fullText": "Liverpool manager Arne Slot says he is \"not weak\" and denies the situation with Mohamed Salah has undermined his authority.\n\nThe 33-year-old winger has been left out of the squad to face Inter Milan in the Champions League on Tuesday after giving an explosive interview two days ago, claiming he was \"thrown under the bus\" by Liverpool and his relationship with Slot had broken down.\n\nSlot says he does not feel that way and was \"surprised\" by Salah's comments.\n\nSpeaking in Milan on Monday night, Slot added he had \"no clue\" if Salah, who signed a new two-year contract in April, had played his last game for Liverpool, but added he was a \"firm believer that there is always a possibility to return for a player\".\n\nHe said his conversation with Salah to tell him he would not travel to Milan was \"a short one\".\n\n\"Usually I am calm and polite, but that doesn't mean I am weak,\" he said.\n\n\"If a player has these commands about so many things, then it's about me and the club to react. We reacted in a way you can see - he's not here.\"\n\nHe added: \"I don't feel my authority is undermined, it is not the way I feel it.\n\n\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation. There is always the possibility to return for a player. I have no clue [if he has played his last game for Liverpool] - I cannot answer that question at this point in time.\"",

    "fullText": "Arsenal defender Leah Williamson is to return to action for the first time since the Euro 2025 final following a four-month absence through injury.\n\nThe England captain is expected to play for \"a couple of minutes\" in Arsenal's Women's Champions League game against FC Twente on Tuesday evening, manager Renee Slegers said.\n\nWilliamson was an unused substitute in Arsenal's 2-1 victory over Liverpool on Saturday.\n\nThe 28-year-old has been absent since Euro 2025 – when she led the Lionesses to back-to-back titles – due to a knee injury which required a small, clean-up operation.\n\n\"She's been training with the team and was in the squad against Liverpool just to get back into her routine and it was good to have her around,\" said Slegers.\n\n\"She is doing well and did the full session again today. She is available for a couple of minutes tomorrow (Tuesday, 20:00 GMT). She won't start but she will be in the squad.\"\n\nDuring her absence Arsenal have struggled to find the form which guided them to the Women's Champions League title under Slegers last season.\n\nThey currently sit eight points off Women's Super League leaders Manchester City and are 10th in the league phase table of the European competition with two wins from four matches.\n\n\"Of course it was unfortunate for her to sustain that injury in the Euros and she had to work hard to come back from it,\" added Slegers.\n\n\"She is in a really good place and has been spending a lot of time on the pitch. Maybe the timing of the international break extended that as there was no opportunity to train in big groups with 11 v 11 and in chaotic moments.\n\n\"But she is very ready and we will be very happy to have her back. The players who have been playing have been doing really well.\"\n\nArsenal captain Kim Little has also recovered from a calf injury, coming off the bench in the 69th minute against Liverpool.\n\nSlegers did not rule out a start for Little against FC Twente but said the club have to be \"really smart\" in managing her return to full fitness.\n\nThe return of experienced players could provide a boost to Slegers' side, who have work to do to qualify for the knockout stages of the Champions League.\n\nAsked if confidence was low in the squad, Slegers said: \"I think that's a word we don't really talk about. We believe with your actions, you can create momentum.\n\n\"Of course, when you look at the second half of last season how easy things were for us and that we were in a flow state, scoring a lot of goals, then if that's different or harder, then of course you have to work even harder from a psychological aspect to make sure everyone feels good and believes in what we're doing. I think that's been excellent from the squad.\"",

    "description": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, Troy Deeney gives us his team of the week. Do you agree with his choices?",
    "fullText": "After every round of Premier League matches this season, BBC football pundit Troy Deeney will give you his team and manager of the week.\n\nHere are this week's choices. Do you agree? Give us your thoughts using the comments form at the bottom of this page.\n\nBart Verbruggen (Brighton): He made four or five really good saves and kept them in the game in the draw against West Ham. On another day West Ham go on to win that. He was bang on it and a big reason why Brighton nicked a draw.\n\nMatty Cash (Aston Villa): Wonderful goal as Aston Villa beat Arsenal and great defending. As a Birmingham fan it pains me to give him credit but he was great and Aston Villa were fantastic. Everyone feels Arsenal are going to run away with the league, but Aston Villa said \"no, not on my watch\".\n\nMarc Guehi (Crystal Palace): He got his team over the line for their win at Fulham and led by example as he always does. He got my mind thinking - not only did he play well this weekend and has been great all season, how much would Liverpool not be in this mess if they had managed to sign him? How good could Liverpool be if they had a proper centre-half like him?\n\nMarco Senesi (Bournemouth): I don't know where Bournemouth keep getting these players from. They sold two centre-halves in the summer and he has just stepped in no problem. He's been absolutely fantastic, and was again as they shut out Chelsea.\n\nBruno Guimaraes (Newcastle): I'm putting Bruno at the base of a diamond in midfield because he is the heart, soul and spirit of Newcastle's team, and was brilliant again against Burnley. He is just a very good football player and there are not many people you can say that about.\n\nAnton Stach (Leeds): He was the player who stood out for Leeds in their draw with Liverpool. The visitors were obviously cruising but I look at players and teams in that moment and look at who is hiding. This guy turned it up - not only a notch but another 10 notches - scored a goal and got an assist.\n\nKiernan Dewsbury-Hall (Everton): Is he the signing of the season? He has been fantastic. Not only is he scoring, he is pulling the strings and has become the heartbeat of this new-look Everton team under David Moyes, who can get another gear out of these players as they did against Nottingham Forest.\n\nBruno Fernandes (Manchester United): Top of the diamond is Fernandes. Two goals at Wolves and an assist. His passing was fantastic. He loses a bit of credit because it was against arguably the worst team I have ever seen in Wolves, but he did very well. Manchester United are back on the winning trail.\n\nXavi Simons (Tottenham): He has had a bit of a tough time at Spurs but it felt like this was his moment to show everyone why people think he is so talented. He has pace, power and glides past people. We used to call people like that a luxury but when you put in a match-winning performance like he did against Brentford, you have to start saying he is just good.\n\nHugo Ekitike (Liverpool): Even though he is in a team that is a shambles, he gets in through the middle. He scored two goals against Leeds. I understand Liverpool spent a lot of money on Alexander Isak - and I am a huge fan - but just start this kid. Get the two of them up front and figure it out.\n\nRayan Cherki (Manchester City) My favourite footballer to watch in world football. Not only was his assist for Phil Foden in the win against Sunderland worth the admission fee, he was just delightful. He is like the cult heroes I grew up with and makes me feel like a kid again watching football. Back in the day you had Ronaldinho, Rivaldo, Ronaldo, Thierry Henry, Jay-Jay Okocha - a plethora of them. Now there is just Rayan Cherki - and he is fantastic.\n\nUnai Emery (Aston Villa): A massive game for Aston Villa. Against Arsenal it was that match where he gets to say: \"Remember me? You got rid of me.\" I think with all that being said, Emery is manager of the week.\n\nDo you agree with Troy's selections? Who would be in your team of the week? Have your say using the comments form below:\n\nWith Liverpool and Mohamed Salah appearing to be moving in different directions - and Salah heading to join his Egypt team-mates for the Africa Cup of Nations next week anyway - the Reds need other players to step up and fill the Salah-shaped hole in the scoring charts. In Hugo Ekitike, they may have found that man.\n\nEkitike is now Liverpool's leading Premier League scorer with five goals, while in all competitions he also tops the charts with eight. On Saturday at Elland Road, the Frenchman scored the first double of his Liverpool career, and with the goals coming in the 48th and 50th minutes, he was the first Premier League player to score twice in the opening five minutes of the second half since Raheem Sterling in March 2019 for Manchester City against Watford.\n\nHe led all players in the match for shots (5), shots on target (3) and touches in the opposition box (9) and his only disappointment must have been the scoreline - he was the first Liverpool player to score two goals in a Premier League and not win since Salah last December in a 3-3 draw with Newcastle.\n\nDespite playing just 398 minutes in the Premier League this season, no player has more assists than Manchester City's Rayan Cherki (5), with two of those coming in the 3-0 victory over Sunderland.\n\nCherki created six chances in open play, the joint most by a player in a Premier League game this season, while at 22 years and 111 days on Saturday he was the second-youngest Manchester City player to achieve that in a Premier League game, older only than - maybe surprisingly - Mario Balotelli in February 2012 against Blackburn Rovers.\n\nAmong players to play 300 minutes in the Premier League, no player has created more chances per 90 minutes than Cherki (3.4) and only four have had more touches in the opposition box per 90 minutes (7.7). The Frenchman is currently assisting a goal, on average, every 80 minutes - also a league best.\n\nBruno Guimaraes has taken 10 corners in the Premier League this season and it is clear which one of those was most memorable - his in-swinging delivery on Saturday against Burnley caught his former team-mate Martin Dubravka out to give the Magpies the lead.\n\nIt was not the first Premier League goal direct from a corner (or 'Olympico goal' as it's known) but it was Newcastle's first ever corner to be put directly into the opponent's goal in the Premier League, to give Guimaraes a slice of Magpies history. Given the term Olympico goal originates from South America, it seems apt that four of the past seven direct corner goals have been scored by players from that continent - all, in fact, from Brazil. Those scorers are Matheus Pereira, Douglas Luiz, Matheus Cunha and Guimaraes.\n\nAside from swinging corners directly into the net, Guimaraes has been in excellent recent form - he now has four goals and two assists across his past nine Premier League appearances, scoring five in total this season. Only in 2023-24 has he ever scored \n\nFollow your Premier League club on BBC Sport\n\nAll your football quizzes in one place\n\nGet football news sent straight to your phone",

The defensive linesman then fumbled the ball and Hurts gathered it up, only to then lose the ball again when he was tackled.\n\nReports from the US indicate it is the first time since records of this nature began in 1978 that a player has turned the ball over twice on the same play.\n\nIt was a chastening game for Hurts who threw a career-high four interceptions at the SoFi Stadium in California, the final one coming when Tony Jefferson picked off a pass at the one-yard line to end the game in overtime.\n\nCameron Dicker had earlier kicked what turned out to be the game-winning 54-yard field goal in the extra period - matching his career-high five field goals in a single game - as the Chargers won 22-19.\n\nChargers quarterback Justin Herbert, who played after undergoing surgery on a fractured hand on 1 December, completed 12 of 26 passes for 139 yards.\n\nA fifth victory in their past six outings leaves the Chargers second in the AFC West, while the Eagles remain top of the NFC East.\n\nBoth sides return to action on 14 December at 20:00 GMT, with the Chargers travelling to the Kansas City Chiefs and the Eagles hosting the Las Vegas Raiders.",

And it still resists.\n\nPresident Florentino Perez has never fully believed in this kind of change, even though people inside the club convinced him to appoint Rafa Benitez, Julien Lopetegui and Xabi Alonso - steps in a new direction.\n\nBut the moment they falter, show doubt or the players stop buying in, Perez turns his thumb down, given that in the past the club has been more successful with less interventionist coaches like Carlo Ancelotti or Zinedine Zidane.\n\nWhen he arrived at Bayer Leverkusen, Alonso asked to be released if any of the clubs he had played for came calling, provided he felt like taking the job.\n\nHe added one more team to that list - Manchester City, as Pep's eventual replacement. Now it could be Pep who leaves him without a job.",

    "fullText": "Liverpool forward Mohamed Salah has been called a \"disgrace\" who has caused \"carnage\" at the club by pundits as the fallout continues from his explosive interview.\n\nSalah said he feels he has been \"thrown under the bus\" after being dropped to the bench for struggling Liverpool's past three games, which led to him being left out of the squad for Tuesday's Champions League match at Inter Milan.\n\nThe two-time Premier League winner's remarks have led to stinging criticism from former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher and ex-Blackburn and Celtic striker Chris Sutton.\n\n\"I thought it was a disgrace,\" Carragher said on Sky Sports. \"Some have painted it as an emotional outburst. I don't think it was.\n\n\"When Mo Salah stops in the mixed zone - which he has done four times in eight years - it is choreographed with him and his agent to cause maximum damage and strengthen his own position.\"\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 5 Live, Sutton said: \"Liverpool is carnage because of Mo Salah.\n\n\"He's been honest and open, but he's made it all about him and not the team. He's been extremely selfish - that's what he's done because now there's a bit of a civil war at Liverpool, and it didn't need to be like this.\"\n\nLiverpool manager Arne Slot said he was \"surprised\" by Salah's comments that their relationship had broken down completely and had \"no clue\" if the 33-year-old would play for the club again.\n\n\"I don't feel my authority is undermined - it is not the way I feel it,\" added Slot in Milan on Monday.\n\n\"After tomorrow we will look at the situation. There is always the possibility to return for a player.\"\n\nEgypt winger Salah will depart for the Africa Cup of Nations next Monday, but with his future at Anfield in doubt it remains to be seen whether he will be involved in Saturday's Premier League home game against Brighton (15:00 GMT).",

    "description": "Manchester United moved into the Premier League top six with their biggest win of the season - but they still have to prove the doubters wrong.",
    "fullText": "In the one step forward, one step back world Manchester United are living in just now, they took a stride in the right direction against Wolves at Molineux.\n\nWhether it is significant or not remains to be seen.\n\nAfter all, the big win at Crystal Palace nine days ago was followed by a dire draw against third-from-bottom West Ham.\n\nBefore that, a three-match winning run was followed by three games without a win, culminating in a home defeat by an Everton side reduced to 10 men after less than 15 minutes.\n\nMonday night's 4-1 drubbing of a hapless Wolves was United's biggest win of the season, equalling a four-goal haul Ruben Amorim's side have not bettered in the Premier League since he came to the club 13 months ago.\n\nUnited had 27 shots, their most in a Premier League game under the Portuguese manager. They have now led in games for longer this season than they did in the entirety of the 2024-25 campaign.\n\nYet Amorim felt compelled to add a caveat, making reference to Wolves' lack of points on the pitch and mutinous atmosphere off it.\n\n\"This is a specific case,\" he said. \"We faced a team that is really, really struggling.\n\n\"You can sense it in every situation of the game.\n\n\"This moment for Wolves is really hard, as a team and as a club. We took advantage of that.\"\n\nIt is why Amorim felt United were in danger of blowing a significant chance to climb into the top six and on the coattails of the sides in contention for Champions League qualification.\n\nNew Wolves boss Rob Edwards felt his side played the way he wanted in the final 15 minutes of the opening period. That included scoring their first goal in 540 minutes through Jean-Ricner Bellegarde.\n\nIt wasn't the script Amorim envisaged. Certainly not one he wanted on a night when Sir Jim Ratcliffe had come to watch and was pictured in animated conversation with director of football Jason Wilcox in the directors' box.\n\nHe told his players this before he left to sit in the visitors' dugout alone with his thoughts before United re-appeared for the start of the second half.\n\n\"We should have finished that half in a different way,\" he said. \"At half-time, they understood we have everything to win the game.\n\n\"If you need to be really distracted, when you look at Everton, that was three points. We could have had two more points against West Ham. Look at the table. Look at the environment. Look at everything.\n\n\"We needed to win the second half. It didn't matter the result.\"\n\nAnalysing the game for Sky Sports, Jamie Carragher praised the performance but said: \"We make the assumption there is a bad result around the corner.\"\n\nHe is not on his own with that opinion. United have still kept only one clean sheet in the Premier League, against Sunderland at Old Trafford on 4 October. Are they on one defeat in nine, or two wins in six?\n\nAfter failing to take opportunities to go second - twice - they are now sixth. If results go their way, they could be fourth once they have played Bournemouth on 15 December. Equally they could be back in the bottom half of the table.\n\nAndoni Iraola's men have taken two points from their past six games but they have won 3-0 on each of their past two visits to Old Trafford.\n\nNothing is for certain at Manchester United these days, it seems, and that includes the availability of their players.\n\nAmorim had thought the Netherlands international Matthijs de Ligt would be available for Monday's game after missing the West Ham match with a minor injury. He was wrong. Now the manager says he can't be sure when De Ligt will be fit.\n\nUnited remain in talks with the respective national associations of Morocco, Ivory Coast and Cameroon, which Amorim said is a \"good sign\" but added he \"doesn't know\" if Noussair Mazraoui, Amad Diallo and Bryan Mbeumo will be cleared to play against Bournemouth before they leave for Africa Cup of Nations duty.\n\n\"Let's wait for the middle of the week,\" said Amorim.\n\nAsked what moving into sixth place means, he added: \"Nothing. It's always the same feeling. We should have more points. But that's in the past, let's focus on the future.\"",

    "fullText": "Gen Z are the first generation to have grown up with social media, they were the earliest adopters, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. Now they are fighting back\n\nLate one night in April 2020, towards the start of the Covid lockdowns, Shanley Clémot McLaren was scrolling on her phone when she noticed a Snapchat post by her 16-year-old sister. “She’s basically filming herself from her bed, and she’s like: ‘Guys you shouldn’t be doing this. These fisha accounts are really not OK. Girls, please protect yourselves.’ And I’m like: ‘What is fisha?’ I was 21, but I felt old,” she says.\n\nShe went into her sister’s bedroom, where her sibling showed her a Snapchat account named “fisha” plus the code of their Paris suburb. Fisha is French slang for publicly shaming someone – from the verb “afficher”, meaning to display or make public. The account contained intimate images of girls from her sister’s school and dozens of others, “along with the personal data of the victims – their names, phone numbers, addresses, everything to find them, everything to put them in danger”.\n\nMcLaren, her sister and their friends reported the account to Snapchat dozens of times, but received no response. Then they discovered there were fisha accounts for different suburbs, towns and cities across France and beyond. Faced with the impunity of the social media platforms, and their lack of moderation, they launched the hashtag #StopFisha.\n\nIt went viral, online and in the media. #StopFisha became a rallying cry, a safe space to share information and advice, a protest movement. Now it was the social media companies being shamed. “The wave became a counter-wave,” says McLaren, who is now 26. The French government got involved, and launched an online campaign on the dangers and legal consequences of fisha accounts. The social media companies began to moderate at last, and #StopFisha is now a “trusted flagger” with Snapchat and TikTok, so when they report fisha content, it is taken down within hours. “I realised that if you want change in your societies, if you come with your idea alone, it won’t work. You need support behind you.”\n\nFour years later, this strategy is playing out on an even larger scale. McLaren and other young activists across Europe are banding together against social media and its ruinous effects on their generation. Individually, young people are powerless to sway big tech, but they are also a substantial part of its business model – so, collectively, they are powerful.\n\nThis is the first generation to have grown up with social media: they were the earliest adopters of it, and therefore the first to suffer its harms. The array of problems is ever-expanding: misogynistic, hateful and disturbing content; addictive and skewed algorithms; invasion of privacy; online forums encouraging harmful behaviours; sextortion; screen addiction; deepfake pornography; misinformation and disinformation; radicalisation; surveillance; biased AI – the list goes on. As the use of social media has risen, there has been a corresponding increase in youth mental health problems, anxiety, depression, self-harm and even suicide.\n\n“Across Europe, a generation is suffering through a silent crisis,” says a new report from People vs Big Tech – a coalition of more than 140 digital rights NGOs from around Europe – and Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, their youth-led spin-off. A big factor is “the design and dominance of social media platforms”.\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim, for people aged 15 to 29, came about in September last year when People vs Big Tech put out a call – on social media, paradoxically. About 20 young people who were already active on these issues came together at a “boot camp” in London. “We were really given the tools to create the movement that we wanted to build,” says McLaren, who attended with her partner. “They booked a big room, they brought the food, pencils, paper, everything we needed. And they were like: ‘This is your space, and we’re here to help.’”\n\nThe group is Europe’s first digital justice movement by and for young people. Their demands are very simple, or at least they ought to be: inclusion of young people in decision-making; a safer, healthier, more equitable social media environment; control and transparency over personal data and how it is used; and an end to the stranglehold a handful of US-based corporations have over social media and online spaces. The overarching principle is: “Nothing for us, without us.”\n\n“This is not just us being angry; it’s us having the right to speak,” says McLaren, who is now a youth mobilisation lead for Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim. Debates over digital rights are already going on, of course, but, she says: “We find it really unfair that we’re not at the table. Young people have so much to say, and they’re real experts, because they have lived experience … So why aren’t they given the proper space?”\n\nMcLaren’s work with #StopFisha took her on a journey into a wider, murkier world of gender-based digital rights: misogynist trolling and sexism, cyberstalking, deepfake pornography – but she realised this was just one facet of the problem. What women were experiencing online, other groups were experiencing in their own ways.\n\nA fellow activist, Yassine, 23, is well aware of this. Originally from north Africa and now living in Germany, Yassine identifies as non-binary. They fled to Europe to escape intolerance in their own country, but the reality of life, even in a supposedly liberal country such as Germany, hit them like a “slap”, they say. “You’re here for your safety, but then you’re trying to fight not only the system that is punishing the queerness of you, but you also have another layer of being a migrant. So you have two battles instead of one.”\n\nAs a migrant they are seen as a threat, Yassine says. “Our bodies and movements must be tracked, fingerprinted and surveilled through intrusive digital systems designed to protect the EU.” For queer people, there are similar challenges. These include “shadow-banning”, for example, by which tech platforms “silence conversations about queer rights, racism or anything that is challenging the dominant system”, either wilfully or algorithmically, through built-in biases.\n\nMeasures such as identity verification “are also putting a lot of people at risk of being erased from these spaces”, says Yassine. There can be good reasons for them, but they can also end up discriminating against non-binary or transgender people – who are often presented with binary gender options; male or female – as well as against refugees and undocumented people, who may be afraid or unable to submit their details online. Given their often tenuous residency status, and sometimes limited digital literacy and access, migrants tend not to speak out, Yassine says. “It definitely feels like you are in a position of: ‘You need to be grateful that you are here, and you should not question the laws.’ But the laws are harming my data.”\n\nOn a more day-to-day level, Yassine says, they must “walk through online spaces knowing they could do harm to me”. If they click on the comments under a social media post, for example, they know they are likely to find racist, homophobic or hateful attacks. Like McLaren, Yassine says that complaining is futile. “I know that they will come back with, ‘This is not a community guidelines breach’, and all of that.”\n\nThese are not mere glitches in the system, says Yassine, who now leads on digital rights at IGLYO, a long-running LGBTQ+ youth rights organisation, founded in Brussels, with a network of groups across Europe. “The systems we design inherit the very structures they arise from, so they inevitably become systems that are patriarchal and racist by design.”\n\nAdele Zeynep Walton’s participation in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim came through personal experience of online harm. In 2022, Walton’s 21-year-old sister, Aimee, took her own life. She had been struggling with her mental health, but had also been spending time on online suicide and self-harm forums, which Walton believes contributed to her death. After that, Walton began to question the digital realm she had grown up in, and her own screen addiction.\n\nWalton’s parents made her first Facebook account when she was 10, she says. She has been on Instagram since she was 12. Her own feelings of body dysmorphia began when she was 13, sparked by pro-anorexia content her friends were sharing. “I became a consumer of that, then I got immersed in this world,” she says. “Generations like mine thought it was totally normal, having this everyday battle with this addictive thing, having this constant need for external validation. I thought those were things that were just wrong with me.”\n\nIn researching her book Logging Off: The Human Cost of our Digital World, Walton, 26, also became aware of how little control young people have over the content that is algorithmically served up to them. “We don’t really have any choice over what our feeds look like. Despite the fact there are things where you can say, ‘I don’t want to see this type of content’, within a week, you’re still seeing it again.”\n\nAlycia Colijn, 29, another member of Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim, knows something about this. She studied data science and marketing analytics at university in Rotterdam, researching AI-driven algorithms – how they can be used to manipulate behaviour, and in whose interests. During her studies she began to think: “It’s weird that I’m trained to gather as much data as I can, and to build a model that can respond to or predict what people want to buy, but I’ve never had a conversation around ethics.” Now she is researching these issues as co-founder of Encode Europe, which advocates for human-centric AI. “I realised how much power these algorithms have over us; over our society, but also over our democracies,” she says. “Can we still speak of free will if the best psychologists in the world are building algorithms that make us addicted?”\n\nThe more she learned, the more concerned Colijn became. “We made social media into a social experiment,” she says. “It turned out to be the place where you could best gather personal data from individuals. Data turned into the new gold, and then tech bros became some of the most powerful people in the world, even though they aren’t necessarily known for caring about society.”\n\nSocial media companies have had ample opportunities to respond to these myriad harms, but invariably they have chosen not to. Just as McLaren found with Snapchat and the fisha accounts, hateful and racist content is still minimally moderated on platforms such as X, Instagram, Snapchat and YouTube. After Donald Trump’s re-election, Mark Zuckerberg stated at the start of this year that Meta would be reducing factcheckers across Facebook and Instagram, just as X has under Elon Musk. This has facilitated the free flow of misinformation. Meta, Amazon and Google were also among the companies announcing they were rolling back their diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, post-Trump’s election. The shift towards the right politically, in the US and Europe, has inevitably affected these platforms’ tolerance of hateful and racist content, says Yassine. “People feel like now they have more rights to be harmful than rights to be protected.”\n\nAll the while, the tech CEOs have become more powerful, economically, politically and in terms of information control. “We don’t believe that power should be in those hands,” says Colijn. “That’s not a true democracy.”\n\nEurope’s politicians aren’t doing much better. Having drafted the Digital Services Act in 2023, which threatened social media companies with fines or bans if they failed to regulate harmful content, the European Commission announced last month it would be rolling back some of its data privacy laws, to allow big tech companies to use people’s personal data for training AI systems.\n\n“Big tech, combined with the AI innovators, say they are the growth of tomorrow’s economy, and that we have to trust them. I don’t think that’s true,” says Colijn. She also disagrees with their argument that regulation harms innovation. “The only thing deregulation fosters is harmful innovation. If we want responsible innovation, we need regulation in place.”\n\nWalton agrees. “Governments and MPs are shooting themselves in the foot by pandering to tech giants, because that just tells young people that they don’t care about our future,” she says. “There’s this massive knowledge gap between the people who are making the decisions, and the tech justice movement and everyday people who are experiencing the harms.”\n\nCtrl+Alt+Reclaim is not calling for the wholesale destruction of social media. All these activists say they have found community, solidarity and joy in online spaces: “We’re fighting for these spaces to accommodate us,” says Yassine. “We’re not protesting to cancel them. We know how harmful they are, but they are still spaces where we have hope.”\n\nColijn echoes this. “Social media used to be a fun place with the promise of connecting the world,” she says. “That’s where we started.” And that’s what they want it to be again.\n\nWill big tech pay attention? They might not have a choice, as countries and legislators begin to take action. This week Australia will become the first country to ban social media accounts for under-16s on major platforms including Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok and X. Last week, after a two-year deliberation, X was fined €120m (£105m) by the EU for breaching data laws. But these companies continue to platform content that is hateful, racist, harmful, misleading or inflammatory, with impunity.\n\nMeanwhile, Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim is just getting started. Other discussions on the table include campaigning for an EU-funded social media platform, an alternative to the big tech oligopoly, created by and for the public. Another alternative is direct action, either protest or consumer activism such as coordinated boycotts. “I think it’s lazy for us to be like: we don’t have any power,” says Walton. “Because we could literally say that about anything: fast fashion, fossil fuels … OK, but how do we change things?”\n\nThe other alternative is simply to log off. “The other side of the coin to this movement of tech justice, and a sort of liberation from the harms that we’ve experienced over the past 20 years, is reducing our screen time,” says Walton. “It is spending more time in community. It is connecting with people who maybe you would have never spoken to on social media, because you’d be in different echo chambers.”\n\nAlmost all the activists in Ctrl+Alt+Reclaim attest to having had some form of screen addiction. As much as social media has brought them together, it has also led to much less face-to-face socialising. “I’ve had to sort of rewire my brain to get used to the awkwardness and get comfortable with being in a social setting and not knowing anyone,” says Walton. “Actually, it would be really nice to return to proper connection.”\n\nIn the UK and Ireland, Samaritans can be contacted on freephone 116 123, or email jo@samaritans.org or jo@samaritans.ie.

When a pack of cards retails at about £4, there’s a huge potential profit to be had.\n\nThis has led to a speculative stock market developing around the card game with adults snapping up all of the cards they can get their hands on, making it impossible for kids, who may actually want to collect them or play the game associated with the cards, to get their hands on it.\n\nOnline, via retailers such as Amazon, you can only request to buy Pokémon cards, after which everyone is entered into an opaque raffle for the chance to buy them. In the real world, meanwhile, resellers will queue for hours outside shops, hover around shelves as they’re being restocked and buy up every item before anyone else can see it – all just to buy boxes that are often kept sealed for later resale.\n\n“My staff have had customers threatening to come back and rip their heads off,” says Ben Thyer, owner of BathTCG – an independent shop specialising in trading card games. “It’s become quite unpleasant at times. I’ve heard of other stores where people have been attacked or there have been robberies. We’ve even seen people who buy our products and list them immediately on Facebook, while still in our carrier bags, or sell it right outside the shop. We’re even anxious to put stuff on the shelf for the public because we just don’t want to entice that sort of behaviour. We used to sell whole boxes of booster packs but now we’ve had to stop doing that, and even place limits on the individual packs.”\n\nFinley Pink, from Keynsham, travelled to BathTCG to arrive almost two hours before opening time to secure some cards at the recent launch of the Phantasmal Flames set. He was first in a line of 40 people. “This is the first set I’ve arrived early for, as I’ve been unable to get cards at other times. It’s a real struggle to find them,” he tells us. “Scalpers are making it impossible to find cards. It’s crazy and YouTubers talking up the money are making things even crazier!”\n\nAdding to the issue of scalpers is the popularity of YouTubers and TikTok influencers recording themselves opening packs, flicking through the contents at mesmerising speed, and listing the card values as they go, exaggerating reactions when they find a “hit”. Common cards are discarded, and only high-value cards matter. The joy of collecting or playing for fun is no longer the point – it’s all about maximising “value”.\n\nPete Sessions, a project manager from Bristol, attended a Pokémon play night at the shop with his son Alfie and is concerned about influencers’ impact on the hobby for his child. “He’s been into Pokémon for a few years, but just got into collecting the cards over the past six months – I’ve had to ask shops when their stock drop days are just to try to find some,” he tells us. “Alfie watches YouTubers and he’s become very aware of the ‘value’ of cards. I’m worried about the perception that it’s easy to make loads of money, when that probably isn’t the case.”\n\n“People are opening these amazing cards on stream, but you don’t know how many thousands of packs they’ve probably gone through, or how much money they’ve spent,” adds Thyer. “So then they feed you the good stuff – that dopamine hit – and you think: ‘Oh, I can do that!’ And then you spend a silly amount of money hoping to get one hit.”\n\nThe hype around potentially making hundreds of pounds by just opening a pack of cards has resulted in a volatile market, to the point that people now use apps such as Collectr to track their card portfolio for price rises and falls. It’s also led to devious practices such as selling fake cards, or opening and resealing packs after swapping out any rare cards.\n\nAnd that’s all before the added layer of the card-grading industry comes into play. Cards can be sent to independent organisations, who rate and seal cards to potentially increase their value, depending on the grade they’re given. Card shows have now become a staple up and down the country, where hobbyists looking for their favourite cards are surrounded by those making trade deals worth, sometimes, tens of thousands.\n\nDespite the fact that The Pokémon Company printed 10.2bn cards in the year to March 2025, they’re still struggling to keep up with demand. When approached for comment, it shared a statement from seven months ago, saying that the company is “actively working to print more of the impacted Pokémon TCG products as quickly as possible and at maximum capacity”.\n\nFortunately there are signs that the reseller market is starting to correct itself as more supply for older sets has started to trickle back on to shelves. “There are signs of the market cracking – prices of singles are coming down, sealed products are coming down. People aren’t as ferocious as they once were,” Thyer says. “There’s also a lot of people now thinking, ‘Christmas is soon and I need some money because I’ve not made what I was hoping for [from reselling cards]’. So we’ll see it dip, but then early 2026 brings Pokémon’s 30th anniversary, so I think we’ll see another crazy period.”\n\nWhile many shops have now adjusted booster pack pricing to reflect their perceived value and make the most of the Pokémon card boom, BathTCG refuses to give into that temptation. “We won’t do it to our customers,” Thyer says. “It’s hard as a business owner to say, ‘I don’t want to make more money’, but I don’t want to be another one of those shops remembered for scalping. Once the bubble bursts and everything goes back to normal, hopefully people will remember that we protected our community and looked after our players – that we ensured our local customers got cards at reasonable prices.”",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Campaign urges PM to show independence from US and push to rein in development of superintelligence\n\nMore than 100 UK parliamentarians are calling on the government to introduce binding regulations on the most powerful AI systems as concern grows that ministers are moving too slowly to create safeguards in the face of lobbying from the technology industry.\n\nA former AI minister and defence secretary are part of a cross-party group of Westminster MPs, peers and elected members of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish legislatures demanding stricter controls on frontier systems, citing fears superintelligent AI “would compromise national and global security”.\n\nThe push for tougher regulation is being coordinated by a nonprofit organisation called Control AI whose backers include the co-founder of Skype, Jaan Tallinn. It is calling on Keir Starmer to show independence from Donald Trump’s White House, which opposes the regulation of AI. One of the “godfathers” of the technology, Yoshua Bengio, recently said it was less regulated than a sandwich.\n\nThe campaigners include the Labour peer and former defence secretary Des Browne, who said superintelligent AI “would be the most perilous technological development since we gained the ability to wage nuclear war”. He said only international cooperation “can prevent a reckless race for advantage that could imperil us all”.\n\nThe Conservative peer and former environment minister Zac Goldsmith said that “even while very significant and senior figures in AI are blowing the whistle, governments are miles behind the AI companies and are leaving them to pursue its development with virtually no regulation”.\n\nBritain hosted an AI safety summit at Bletchley Park in 2023, which concluded there was “potential for serious, even catastrophic, harm, either deliberate or unintentional” from the most advanced AI systems. It set up the AI Safety Institute, now called the AI Security Institute, which has become an internationally respected body. Less emphasis, however, has been placed on the summit’s call to address risks through international cooperation.\n\nGoldsmith said the UK should “resume its global leadership on AI security by championing an international agreement to prohibit the development of superintelligence until we know what we are dealing with and how to contain it”.\n\nThe calls for state intervention in the AI race come after one of Silicon Valley’s leading AI scientists told the Guardian humanity would have to decide by 2030 whether to take the “ultimate risk” of letting AI systems train themselves to become more powerful. Jared Kaplan, the co-founder and chief scientist at frontier AI company Anthropic, said: “We don’t really want it to be a Sputnik-like situation where the government suddenly wakes up and is like: Oh, wow, AI is a big deal.”\n\nLabour’s programme set out in July 2024 said it would legislate “to place requirements on those working to develop the most powerful artificial intelligence models”. But no bill has been published and the government has faced White House pressure not to inhibit commercial AI development, mostly pioneered by US firms.\n\nA spokesperson for the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology said: “AI is already regulated in the UK, with a range of existing rules already in place. We have been clear on the need to ensure the UK and its laws are ready for the challenges and opportunities AI will bring and that position has not changed.”\n\nThe bishop of Oxford, Steven Croft, who is backing the Control AI campaign, called for an independent AI watchdog to scrutinise public sector use and for AI companies to be required to meet minimum testing standards before releasing new models.\n\n“There are all kinds of risks and the government doesn’t seem to have adopted a precautionary principle,” he said. “At the moment there are significant risks: the mental health of children and adults, the environmental costs and other big risks in terms of the alignment of generalised AI and [the question of] what is good for humanity. The government seems to be moving away from regulation.”\n\nThe UK’s first AI minister under Rishi Sunak, Jonathan Berry, said the time was coming when binding regulations should be applied to models that present existential risks. He said rules should be global and would create tripwires so if AI models reached a certain power their makers would have to show they had been tested, designed with off switches and were capable of being retrained.\n\n“International frontier AI safety has not gone on in leaps and bounds as we had hoped,” he said. He cited recent cases of chatbots being involved in encouraging suicides, people using them as therapists and believing they are gods. “The risks, now, are very serious and we need to be constantly on our guard,” he said.\n\nThe chief executive of Control AI, Andrea Miotti, criticised the current “timid approach” and said: “There has been a lot of lobbying from the UK and US. AI companies are lobbying governments in the UK and US to stall regulation arguing it is premature and would crush innovation. Some of these are the same companies who say AIs could destroy humanity.”\n\nHe said the speed with which AI technology was advancing meant mandatory standards could be needed in the next one or two years.",

    "fullText": "Exclusive: Congress urged to act against energy-hungry facilities blamed for increasing bills and worsening climate crisis\n\nA coalition of more than 230 environmental groups has demanded a national moratorium on new datacenters in the US, the latest salvo in a growing backlash to a booming artificial intelligence industry that has been blamed for escalating electricity bills and worsening the climate crisis.\n\nThe green groups, including Greenpeace, Friends of the Earth, Food & Water Watch and dozens of local organizations, have urged members of Congress to halt the proliferation of energy-hungry datacenters, accusing them of causing planet-heating emissions, sucking up vast amounts of water and exacerbating electricity bill increases that have hit Americans this year.\n\n“The rapid, largely unregulated rise of datacenters to fuel the AI and crypto frenzy is disrupting communities across the country and threatening Americans’ economic, environmental, climate and water security,” the letter states, adding that approval of new data centers should be paused until new regulations are put in place.\n\nThe push comes amid a growing revolt against moves by companies such as Meta, Google and Open AI to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into new datacenters, primarily to meet the huge computing demands of AI. At least 16 datacenter projects, worth a combined $64bn, have been blocked or delayed due to local opposition to rising electricity costs. The facilities’ need for huge amounts of water to cool down equipment has also proved controversial, particularly in drier areas where supplies are scarce.\n\nThese seemingly parochial concerns have now multiplied to become a potent political force, helping propel Democrats to a series of emphatic recent electoral successes in governor elections in Virginia and New Jersey as well as a stunning upset win in a special public service commission poll in Georgia, with candidates campaigning on lowering power bill costs and curbing datacenters.\n\nThis threatens to be a major headache for Donald Trump, who has aggressively pushed the growth of AI but also called himself the “affordability president” and vowed to cut energy costs in half in his first year.\n\nHowever, household electricity prices have increased by 13% so far under Trump and the president recently lashed out in the wake of the election losses, calling affordability a “fake narrative” and a “con job” created by Democrats. “They just say the word,” Trump said last week. “It doesn’t mean anything to anybody. They just say it – affordability.”\n\nYet about 80 million Americans are currently struggling to pay their bills for electricity and gas, with many voters regardless of political party blaming datacenters for this, according to Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines, a non-partisan organization that aims to reduce power bills.\n\n“We saw rising utility bills become a core concern in the New Jersey, Georgia and Virginia elections, which shows us there is a new politics in America – we are entering a new era that is all about electricity prices,” Hua said.\n\n“Nobody in America wants to pay more for electricity and we saw in Georgia a meaningful chunk of conservative voters vote against the Republican incumbents, which was staggering.”\n\nHua said the causes of the electricity cost rises were nuanced, with ageing transmission lines and damage caused by extreme weather also adding to utilities’ costs on top of the surging demand for power.\n\nBut it is the growth of datacenters to service AI – with electricity consumption set to nearly triple over the next decade, equivalent to powering 190m new homes – that is the focus of ire for voters as well as an unlikely sweep of politicians ranging from Bernie Sanders on the left to Marjorie Taylor Greene on the far right.\n\nMore broadly, almost half of Americans say the cost of living in the US, including power, food and other essentials, is the worst they can ever remember it being.\n\nThis focus on affordability has provided a new line of attack for an environmental movement that has struggled to counter Trump’s onslaught upon rules that reduce air and water pollution. The president has called the climate crisis a “hoax” and clean energy a “scam” and has slashed support for and even blocked new wind and solar projects, even though renewables are often the cheapest and fastest options for new power generation.\n\nAt the current rate of growth, datacenters could add up to 44m tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere by 2030, equivalent to putting an extra 10m cars on to the road and exacerbating a climate crisis that is already spurring extreme weather disasters and ripping apart the fabric of the American insurance market.\n\nBut it is the impact upon power bills, rather than the climate crisis, that is causing anguish for most voters, acknowledged Emily Wurth, managing director of organizing at Food & Water Watch, the group behind the letter to lawmakers.\n\n“I’ve been amazed by the groundswell of grassroots, bipartisan opposition to this, in all types of communities across the US,” she said. “Everyone is affected by this, the opposition has been across the political spectrum. A lot of people don’t see the benefits coming from AI and feel they will be paying for it with their energy bills and water.\n\n“It’s an important talking point,” Wurth said of the affordability concerns. “We’ve seen outrageous utility price rises across the country and we are going to lean into this. Prices are going up across the board and this is something Americans really do care about.”",

    "fullText": "As midlife audiences turn to digital media, the 55 to 64 age bracket is an increasingly important demographic\n\nIn 2022, Caroline Idiens was on holiday halfway up an Italian mountain when her brother called to tell her to check her Instagram account. “I said, ‘I haven’t got any wifi. And he said: ‘Every time you refresh, it’s adding 500 followers.’ So I had to try to get to the top of the hill with the phone to check for myself.”\n\nA personal trainer from Berkshire who began posting her fitness classes online at the start of lockdown in 2020, Idiens, 53, had already built a respectable following.\n\nBut after one video offering guidance on getting toned summer arms was picked up by a US fitness account, that number rocketed to 50,000 – and beyond. “I post it every year now as a bit of a tribute,” she jokes. “It was that reel that launched me into a whole new market.”\n\nToday, as @carolinescircuits, she has 2.3 million followers on Instagram, more than 70,000 on Tiktok and 50,000 on YouTube, and a book, Fit at 50, that was a recent Sunday Times bestseller – making her a key influencer in an increasingly important demographic for social media platforms: those in midlife and older.\n\nIf you want to grow your reach on social media, figures suggested this week, you could do worse than target the over-55s.\n\nResearch from media analysts Ampere found it was people in the 55 to 64 age bracket who were delivering the highest growth in YouTube traffic, up 20% since 2020 in the US and 14% in the UK. Tiktok, too, has had a 16% rise in British users in this age bracket in the past year.\n\n“We’ve been seeing this trend over the last few years where older audiences who have traditionally [focused on] linear and broadcast TV have been digitising,” says Minal Modha, the head of Ampere’s consumer research division.\n\n“And by getting access to things like smartphones and smart TVs in particular, it’s opening up a whole new world for them.” More than half of US adults in the age bracket now watch influencer videos weekly.\n\nSome of them will be tuning in to Valerie Mackay from Inverness, who as @embracingfifty has gained 312,000 followers on Tiktok and almost 1 million on Instagram since she started her warmly chatty account eight years ago.\n\n“In hindsight, I wouldn’t have picked that name ’cause I’m now 62 and stuck with it. But the point of the name was I was embracing life over 50. I had two children, they had both left home and I was enjoying life with myself and my husband, it was like freedom.”\n\nShe founded her account after overhearing a woman asking what was the point of makeup and style after a certain age. “I just thought, well, what’s the point in life? Just dress and be who you want to be.”\n\nMackay says she tries not to think about the huge numbers watching her from around the world – many of whom share an interest in the Scottish weather.\n\n“I get asked a lot: ‘I’m coming to Scotland, what do I wear?’ Which it’s difficult for me to answer because I might be flitting about in a trench coat and they might need big coats.”\n\nMark Lidster is a 62-year-old from north London who posts videos as FitnessGeezer on YouTube and Instagram, attracting up to 1m views. “There are a lot of guys out there getting to 40, through to 70, 80 – who relate and take inspiration from what I’m doing,” he says.\n\nLike Mackay, Lidster says actively engaging with his audience is crucial. As well as becoming more savvy with tech, he says, “people of that age are feeling more disconnected from society, and getting lonelier. Social media is another way of feeling part of something – I try to create that community feel.”\n\nThe crucial thing with 50-somethings and older is “to keep it genuine”, says Idiens, who is 53.\n\n“The biggest thing about social media in this age bracket is trust,” she says.\n\n“It has to be genuine – we are a little bit older and wiser, and what the audience are really looking for are people that they can trust with advice. For the midlife demographic, they also really love that sense of community.\n\n“Even with an audience of 2 million, I still think, when I’m putting up a post, that it’s going to my friends and family group. And the feedback I get is that [my followers] still feel like I’m a PT [personal trainer] in their sitting room – which, for me, is everything. That’s what I want.”",

    "fullText": "Study of 8,300 US children suggests social media may be contributing to a rise in ADHD diagnoses\n\nIncreased use of social media by children damages their concentration levels and may be contributing to an increase in cases of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, according to a study.\n\nThe peer-reviewed report monitored the development of more than 8,300 US-based children from the age of 10 to 14 and linked social media use to “increased inattention symptoms”.\n\nReseachers at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden and the Oregon Health & Science University in the US found that children spent an average of 2.3 hours a day watching television or online videos, 1.4 hours on social media and 1.5 hours playing video games.\n\nNo link was found between ADHD-related symptoms – such as being easily distracted – and playing video games or watching TV and YouTube. However, the study found that social media use over a period of time was associated with an increase in inattention symptoms in children. ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder with symptoms including impulsiveness, forgetting everyday tasks and difficulty focusing.\n\n“We identified an association between social media use and increased inattention symptoms, interpreted here as a likely causal effect,” said the study. “Although the effect size is small at individual level, it could have significant consequences if behaviour changes across population level. These findings suggest that social media use may contribute to rising incidence of ADHD diagnoses.”\n\nTorkel Klingberg, a professor of cognitive neuroscience at the Karolinska Institute, said: “Our study suggests that it is specifically social media that affects children’s ability to concentrate.\n\n“Social media entails constant distractions in the form of messages and notifications, and the mere thought of whether a message has arrived can act as a mental distraction. This affects the ability to stay focused and could explain the association.”\n\nThe study found the ADHD link was not affected by socioeconomic background or a genetic predisposition towards the condition. Klingberg added that increased use of social media may explain part of the increase in ADHD diagnoses. Its prevalence among children has risen from 9.5% in 2003-07 to 11.3% in 2020-22, according to the US national survey of children’s health.\n\nThe researchers stressed the results did not imply all children who used social media developed concentration problems. But they pointed to increased use of social media by children as they got older and to children using social media well before they turned 13, the minimum age for apps such as TikTok and Instagram.\n\nThe report said: “This early and increasing social media use underscores the need for stricter age verification and clearer guidelines for tech companies.”\n\nThe study found a steady increase in social media use from about 30 minutes a day at age nine to two and a half hours a day by age 13. The children were enrolled for the study at the ages of nine and 10 between 2016 and 2018. The study will be published in the Pediatrics Open Science journal.\n\n“We hope that our findings will help parents and policymakers make well-informed decisions on healthy digital consumption that support children’s cognitive development,” said Samson Nivins, one of the study’s authors and a postdoctoral researcher at the Karolinska Institute.",
